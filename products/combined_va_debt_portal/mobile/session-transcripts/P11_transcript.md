Emily  
Yeah. And I'm just gonna ask you again just to confirm. So it's on the record. Now that we are recording, are you? Okay? If I record the audio and visual today.

3  
0:00:10  
P11  
Yep, that's fine.

4  
0:00:12  
Emily  
And are you okay? If I potentially show any clips to our Va partners.

5  
0:00:16  
P11  
Yes.

6  
0:00:17  
Emily  
Great. Thank you so much. Okay, so now on to the discussion. First, st I'd love to know a bit about yourself as a veteran. This could be. Whatever you're comfortable sharing don't have to go into much detail at all. It could be what branch you served in when you retired or separated. Things like that.

7  
0:00:35  
P11  
Sure I was [redacted] from 2,003 to 2,015, including [redacted], and then got out entirely for several years, and then in 2019, joined the [redacted] Reserves.

8  
0:01:03  
Emily  
Oh, okay.

9  
0:01:04  
P11  
Yep.

10  
0:01:05  
Emily  
And then how about any sort of experience you've had with the Va.

11  
0:01:12  
P11  
So for va healthcare I

12  
0:01:18  
P11  
trying to think I applied pretty soon after I got out because [redacted]. So I've had va health care for, I think, 9 years now. And it's how I get all of my healthcare, and then I've also used the gi bill.

13  
0:01:39  
Emily  
Got it? Okay? And then how about any experience you've had with the Va website and or mobile app.

14  
0:01:47  
P11  
I use. I do not use the mobile app, but I use the website all the time. My civilian job is, I work on ships out in the middle of the ocean, and so, being able to use the messaging and having all my digital health records is gold, because otherwise there's no way I would be able to communicate with my doctors, or get anything set up.

15  
0:02:10  
Emily  
Okay, got it

16  
0:02:11  
Emily  
alright. And so you said you you do not use the mobile app. Any any specific reason? You don't use it.

17  
0:02:17  
P11  
I don't have cell service out at sea.

18  
0:02:20  
Emily  
Good reason not to. Okay.

19  
0:02:24  
Emily  
All right. So now we're going to move to the financial portion of the discussion, and I want to make sure you're only sharing what you are comfortable. I have 0 information about any sort of financial records, anything related to really anything about you regarding the Va. So first, st I know, I said. We're going to get to medical payments in just a moment first.st Have you had any experience with owing the Va. Money in regards to any benefit overpayments?

20  
0:02:53  
P11  
I got a notice at 1 point when I used the the gi bill that they had changed their formula, and they were

21  
0:03:01  
P11  
like I owed them X amount of money. It wasn't very much, but then that there was some legislation that it was forgiven, and they were just sending me a notice to let me know, so it was very kind of complicated, but in the end I didn't have to send them any money, which was very nice.

22  
0:03:17  
Emily  
Okay. And was this all in a letter, or how? How did you get the information.

23  
0:03:21  
P11  
Yeah, they sent me a letter in the mail, which again is complicated because I work on ships out at sea. So I think by the time I it even reached me. It was months after the fact.

24  
0:03:32  
Emily  
Okay? And was this? And so I know you said, it was forgiven. Was this all in one communication, or were there multiple communications.

25  
0:03:40  
P11  
Well, I read it all at once, because I only get my mail every few months. It might have been 2 separate letters, but I recall that I learned about it all at the same time.

26  
0:03:54  
Emily  
Okay, that makes sense. Alright. And then how about any experience you have with medical co-pays through the Va.

27  
0:04:04  
P11  
Yeah. So that got that's been messy again. I

28  
0:04:09  
P11  
it. It'll be really nice when it's all digitized, because they send a paper bill, and by the time I get it it's usually past due, and it's very. It's very frustrating, like. The copayments are very small, but it's very frustrating. At 1 point I had to. I was traveling, and I had to go to urgent care.

29  
0:04:32  
P11  
And I went. I jumped through all the hoops, which is really difficult when you're trying to. You know, you're having a medical emergency. The last thing you want to do is spend hours on the phone like before you can even get treated. But I jumped through all the hoops, and then they didn't pay anything. And so that was months and months of trying to get that sorted out and sending letters, and part of it worked, and part of it didn't. And that was really frustrating. And then

30  
0:04:59  
P11  
another experience. I had [redacted] while I was on active duty. So there's [redacted] things I have to do every year. And it's in addition to the normal types of screenings, and so I quite often have a [redacted]in the same year. And

31  
0:05:21  
P11  
oh! What happened was, I went for the [redacted] and the Iv failed, and so they had me come back a couple of days later, and it was referred out, and so, because it showed up as doing the same service twice within whatever the billing period was, I got a bill for the second one that was like $6,000, and it took a long time to get it sorted out that like, yeah. Actually, your Iv failed. And that's why I had to come back like, I'm not gaming the system.

32  
0:05:50  
P11  
But that again. It's really difficult, because you're trying to make all these phone calls that go on for hours and hours. And I'm not retired. I don't have hours to sit around. I'm on a boat in the middle of the ocean. I have to use a satellite phone, so anyways.

33  
0:06:04  
Emily  
Okay, and are you?

34  
0:06:05  
Emily  
You? So now you said you you were, were you receiving letters for each of these bills for for for the co-pays?

35  
0:06:15  
P11  
So for the normal copays they just send a bill in the mail, but it's very erratic like sometimes it can be months before. Like, say, for example, I'm actually seeing my doctor today, and I had a [redacted] yesterday. It might be 2 or 3 months before it even I even get a bill in the mail, and then

36  
0:06:36  
P11  
it's like, by the time I receive it, it's already past due, and certainly by the time I, my mail catches up with me. And so I end up making a lot of phone calls trying to figure out like, is it coming? How much do I owe, and then sometimes it's

37  
0:06:52  
P11  
like I can't figure it out, and I consider myself a reasonably smart person. But sometimes I get charged a copay, and sometimes I don't get charged a copay, and I know during Covid they waived a lot of it, but I think it's back.

38  
0:07:04  
P11  
But then I haven't been charged recently. And so that's further complicated. Because then I don't get a bill. And I'm like, do I actually owe something? And it's past due. And I'm going to pay penalties on it, or is it not being charged? Am I just missing the bill? It's very complicated. Luckily the amounts are relatively small, but it's it's a degree of frustration. I wish I didn't have to deal with.

39  
0:07:26  
Emily  
Okay, got it. And then what? are there other things besides these physical letters that are prompting you to make payments.

40  
0:07:37  
P11  
Well, as I said sometimes, just because in the past I know there's a copayment for, say, a medication or a certain type of visit, and I know that I have consumed those services and not received a bill, and so I don't want to have to pay penalties or have it go to collections or go on my credit record. So I will call and try to figure out how much I owe. But that's like

41  
0:08:03  
P11  
extremely complicated, too. There's not a simple way to just look up a bill.

42  
0:08:08  
Emily  
Okay.

43  
0:08:09  
Emily  
got it? So I'm I can guess a few things from my next question of how? How could things be made easier.

44  
0:08:18  
P11  
I mean, I would just put it. We already have the digital, everything. I would put everything in there. I keep hearing like there's a way to do that, but it's not set up yet.

45  
0:08:29  
P11  
And so, yeah, I would just put everything in there digitally and have it connect to pay.gov, and then you just pay your co-pays right there, maybe even get some sort of push notification or email that tells you like, Hey, your bill just posted. Go take a look at it. That that would be fantastic.

46  
0:08:50  
Emily  
Yeah. And are you so when you do make payments? Are, are you making that through pay.gov? Or is that when you're calling.

47  
0:08:58  
P11  
Yes, I make it through pay.gov whenever I can, unless I don't have a paper bill, or I don't have the information that I need to be able to pay through pay.gov.

48  
0:09:08  
Emily  
Okay. Got it all right. Well, I'm sorry for all that frustration that.

49  
0:09:13  
P11  
Okay.

50  
0:09:13  
Emily  
Sounds good whatsoever. So let me have move on to the next section. Let me have you share your screen.

51  
0:09:22  
P11  
Alright. I don't know how to do that.

52  
0:09:24  
Emily  
Yeah. So if you tap in the middle there, you should have some options at the bottom, one of which should say the word share.

53  
0:09:31  
P11  
Okay, got it screen.

54  
0:09:35  
Emily  
Yeah, share screen.

55  
0:09:40  
Emily  
Alright. There we go, and you can just tap anywhere outside of that. There we go. Perfect. Okay, and now, let me have you open up the figma app

56  
0:09:55  
Emily  
alright and go to log into figma. I'm going to give you a test account here. Yep, continue there.

57  
0:10:03  
Emily  
Okay, the email is [redacted]

58  
0:10:17  
Emily  
And the password is [redacted]

59  
0:10:23  
P11  
[redacted]

60  
0:10:24  
Emily  
All sorry. Yes, [redacted]

61  
0:10:27  
Emily  
Okay. And then I need to get you the code. So give me just a moment for that. My email to refresh. Come on, there we go, all right. And the code is 7, 9, 7,

62  
0:10:41  
Emily  
2, 8, 4, 8.

63  
0:10:49  
Emily  
Okay, and continue with mobile app.

64  
0:10:55  
Emily  
All right. Now I'm gonna send you a link in zoom.

65  
0:11:00  
Emily  
So go back to Zoom to get the yeah, there we go, Emily. There we go.

66  
0:11:08  
Emily  
tap on the extra long one there, perfect. Give it just a moment to load there.

67  
0:11:23  
Emily  
Okay, great. Oh, and then something I forgot to clarify. So when you're on when you are out to see is there a

68  
0:11:33  
Emily  
pew? So yeah, yeah, you use satellite service when you're are you on a computer? If you want to log into anything.

69  
0:11:41  
P11  
Yes, yeah, there's no Wi-fi because of secure like cyber security issues.

70  
0:11:46  
Emily  
Oh, got it? Got it? Okay.

71  
0:11:47  
P11  
So yeah, I can log into a computer. And then I have to use a CAG reader to get into the like VA system.

72  
0:11:56  
Emily  
Okay, got it? Got it? Alright. Okay. So we're gonna here we are on your pretend mobile app, or you can just tap anywhere outside of the the little blue dots here. Perfect. So before I have you tap on anything, you can scroll around, but just don't yet tap into anything. Where would you expect to find medical copays here on this pretend app.

73  
0:12:26  
P11  
I might go to health.

74  
0:12:29  
Emily  
Health. Okay. Got it any other

75  
0:12:34  
Emily  
sound? A little hesitant there. So other other sections you might. You might go to.

76  
0:12:40  
P11  
I might try payments.

77  
0:12:42  
Emily  
Okay.

78  
0:12:44  
P11  
It's very confusing, because I would expect something to say something like bills.

79  
0:12:48  
Emily  
Hmm, okay.

80  
0:12:49  
P11  
But I don't see anything that says bills. It's definitely like a benefit that sounds like, you know, a a Va loan or something and a claim. It's not a claim. It's not an appointment. It's not a message.

81  
0:13:04  
P11  
It's not a disability rating

82  
0:13:06  
P11  
to me. A payment is like people who receive, you know, disability payments from the Va. That's not me. So yeah, I'm not really seeing anything that that jumps out to me. I would want it to say something like bills.

83  
0:13:20  
Emily  
Okay, great. Well, let me have you tap into the payment section.

84  
0:13:26  
Emily  
Okay? So now that we're seeing this, thought, and we're gonna in this, in this scenario, we're going to pretend that you do also have an overpayment debt.

85  
0:13:37  
P11  
Okay.

86  
0:13:37  
Emily  
Thoughts on what information is shared here under the payment section.

87  
0:13:45  
P11  
Yeah, I guess

88  
0:13:46  
P11  
I would make it clearer, like, divide it up by category. So it says, Copays. But I would make it really clear. It's like for healthcare.

89  
0:13:55  
Emily  
Oh, okay.

90  
0:13:57  
P11  
I guess the word copay is associated with healthcare, but in my mind I'm looking for like something healthcare related.

91  
0:14:03  
Emily  
Hmm, okay.

92  
0:14:05  
P11  
Because I don't really other than I use the Gi bill for like a month

93  
0:14:12  
P11  
but other than that.

94  
0:14:14  
P11  
like, I'm not either. I'm not eligible for the other stuff, or I don't use it. And so I, yeah.

95  
0:14:21  
P11  
okay.

96  
0:14:22  
Emily  
And okay. So you'd want copays renamed something that had to do directly with healthcare.

97  
0:14:28  
P11  
Or have it have like a heading above it, or something that says, like Va health or something, you know. Divide it up like

98  
0:14:35  
P11  
gi Bill, va loans disability va health. Whatever.

99  
0:14:40  
Emily  
Got it. Okay, that makes sense, and then thoughts. So I know you said that the word payments was confusing, that you would prefer something like bills. Any any any further thoughts on the title of the section. Now that you're seeing seeing what's inside.

100  
0:14:59  
P11  
yeah, maybe. I mean, if they want to combine payments that are being sent to me along with payments that I have to send to them. Maybe something like financial.

101  
0:15:11  
Emily  
Okay.

102  
0:15:14  
Emily  
makes sense. Okay, and then I'm gonna have you tap into further in just a moment. But 1st so for the the section under where it says, Copays thoughts on anything else you might. What is that where it says? 2 50 due for 2 bills. Anything else you might want to know when you 1st tap into this page.

103  
0:15:35  
P11  
Yeah, I wanna know what the date is that it's due. So it should say, like, due

104  
0:15:40  
P11  
August 1, st 2025, or whatever.

105  
0:15:44  
Emily  
Okay, you want to know due date. Okay? Anything else. At this point you'd want to know.

106  
0:15:49  
P11  
No, that's okay. I just wanna know, like, how long do I have to pay it?

107  
0:15:54  
Emily  
Okay, yeah. Makes sense. All right. Let me have you tap into Copays here, and then let me get your thoughts on looking here, on. How clear it is what you currently owe in this pretend scenario.

108  
0:16:19  
P11  
Yeah, I think this makes sense. I'm assuming that when I click on the review details, it's gonna tell me what the service was in like what the total charge and what my co-payment would be. One thing that

109  
0:16:33  
P11  
now again, maybe it's in the review details, but I

110  
0:16:38  
P11  
would want I need a place where I can get like a Pdf copy of the bill. Because I have

111  
0:16:47  
P11  
like Hsa, and so I can get things reimbursed through there, but I need to be able to submit, not just my payment on it. So I submit the pay.gov receipt, but I also need to send them a copy of the bill, and it can be digital

112  
0:17:05  
P11  
But there needs to be a clear way that I can like download it.

113  
0:17:09  
Emily  
Hmm, okay. And when you download it, what, specifically, would you be doing with it next, knowing that you'll have to submit it.

114  
0:17:18  
P11  
Well, I work for the Federal. So it's through Fsa Feds. But I have to take the digital file and upload it to that. And I think it's similar for people who have other types of Hsas as well.

115  
0:17:31  
Emily  
Hmm, okay. Got it.

116  
0:17:33  
P11  
There's a portal that they would have to upload it to.

117  
0:17:38  
Emily  
Okay. And do you know, if that's something you would be able to do from the phone like, if you were to be able to download the Pdf. From the app.

118  
0:17:46  
P11  
I honestly don't know, because I don't do a lot of stuff on my phone. Since I'm out at sea. I'm assuming the Fsa Feds website has also a mobile app or well, I know I could log in from my phone. The thing is that everything has changed now for all the different logins, and you have to use your cat card for everything. So

119  
0:18:07  
P11  
it's really hard unless you get a Cac reader for your phone. That's why I just do everything on a computer. Well, it's 1 1 of the reasons I do everything on my computer.

120  
0:18:17  
Emily  
All right. That makes sense. Okay, so we're going to look at just this top one here, the James A. Haley Veterans Hospital. Excuse me so if you can tap into it, since you've already mentioned the review details. But what, specifically, would you be looking for? And are things here that you would be looking for.

121  
0:18:38  
P11  
So the current statement is good. That's how where I could get the Pdf, and

122  
0:18:43  
P11  
I could just email it to myself. So even if I download it on my phone, I could email it to myself. And then I could access it from any computer.

123  
0:19:06  
P11  
I assume that this top link is a way that takes me to pay.gov or some other way that I could pay it online.

124  
0:19:14  
P11  
And then I assume that each of these

125  
0:19:18  
P11  
charges I can get more information on.

126  
0:19:21  
P11  
for example, how much the total charge was, what my copay was, how much was written off, etc.

127  
0:19:28  
Emily  
Okay, so I think just that top one is actually filled out. If you want to tap into that and just see I'm sorry. The the top

128  
0:19:36  
Emily  
the outpatient care. Yeah.

129  
0:19:39  
Emily  
Thoughts on info here, and what you would be looking for.

130  
0:19:43  
P11  
Yeah. So this seems really vague. What I what I'm used to seeing is.

131  
0:19:50  
P11  
and maybe this is like, I don't know. Maybe there. This is all there is, but I'm used to seeing like there's a total amount. And then there's like what your copay was or there's like more specifics about what you actually did.

132  
0:20:05  
Emily  
Okay.

133  
0:20:07  
P11  
Like what the I forget what the word, what the but there's like a code like a billing code.

134  
0:20:13  
Emily  
Oh, sure. Yeah.

135  
0:20:14  
P11  
Yeah.

136  
0:20:15  
Emily  
Okay, so you want more information here.

137  
0:20:18  
P11  
Yeah, this seems really vague.

138  
0:20:19  
Emily  
Vague. Okay, too vague. Got it. Let me have you go back to Copay Bill. You can tap on the other. We go perfect. Okay? So you would. You would. Also assume that there'd be a place to pay. Let's say there

139  
0:20:34  
Emily  
was not. What else might you want to do from this section of our pretend app.

140  
0:20:43  
P11  
If there's not a way to pay.

141  
0:20:45  
Emily  
Right.

142  
0:20:47  
P11  
Well, I would want there to be a link, I mean, with the account number here.

143  
0:20:52  
P11  
I could go to pay.gov, and just enter this information.

144  
0:20:58  
P11  
but I don't think the average person

145  
0:21:01  
P11  
would remember that. That's how they could do it.

146  
0:21:04  
Emily  
Okay, got it.

147  
0:21:11  
Emily  
And let's say we're going to pretend here that

148  
0:21:17  
Emily  
you see an error in, let's say, like one of the prescriptions listed was something you didn't actually take, or what wasn't prescribed, or something. What would be your next step if you saw that there was an error in this particular bill.

149  
0:21:34  
P11  
I assume it's with request help. But to me request help is like

150  
0:21:40  
P11  
I need a payment plan, and I can't pay it rather than

151  
0:21:44  
P11  
like. There's a problem with my bill.

152  
0:21:46  
Emily  
Hmm!

153  
0:21:50  
Emily  
And so what? What would you be looking for? And and you can tap into anything you're you're saying.

154  
0:22:00  
P11  
Oh, well, that's useless.

155  
0:22:06  
P11  
yeah, honestly, at this point, I mean, I would just be calling like the Va. Number, which isn't even listed here. So that's kind of frustrating. Maybe I would tap up here.

156  
0:22:17  
Emily  
Okay.

157  
0:22:19  
P11  
You have questions.

158  
0:22:24  
P11  
Yeah, I guess I would do that.

159  
0:22:35  
P11  
yeah. Again, it seems a little too complicated. Like.

160  
0:22:39  
P11  
if I have a problem, I should just be able to like.

161  
0:22:43  
P11  
click a button next to it, and then it

162  
0:22:47  
P11  
like a dispute. This charge button and I click it, and then it like immediately takes me. Ask me, do I want to like chat with someone, or do I want to?

163  
0:22:56  
P11  
You know, go get on the phone with them.

164  
0:22:59  
Emily  
Hmm, okay.

165  
0:23:01  
P11  
It. It seems like too laborious. There's too many buttons to push and like things to navigate.

166  
0:23:07  
Emily  
Okay. So, too too complicated to get to the help you might need.

167  
0:23:12  
P11  
Yeah. Like for each of these charges, you should have a couple of buttons, or maybe if you swipe left or right, some things pop up that, say, like, pay this bill, dispute this charge

168  
0:23:26  
P11  
like request, help paying this bill, or something like that, or payment plan, or something like that.

169  
0:23:31  
Emily  
Okay, got it?

170  
0:23:34  
Emily  
And then

171  
0:23:36  
Emily  
Since you had started mentioning like having trouble paying the bill. Things like that. Were you aware that there were options to to request help for paying a bill.

172  
0:23:49  
P11  
I mean vaguely.

173  
0:23:51  
P11  
it's not something that has been a concern of mine, except when I got the [redacted] bill that I wasn't supposed to get. I was like, Yeah, there's no way I'm gonna pay this one.

174  
0:24:03  
P11  
But yeah, it's not. I mean, Va, health care is extremely affordable. And so

175  
0:24:12  
P11  
for me personally, it's not an issue. But I could understand. I mean, there's homeless veterans who are accessing services, or very low income seniors and disabled people and whatnot, so I can see that it could be difficult for other people.

176  
0:24:27  
Emily  
Okay, good. And when you said you were vaguely aware that there are options, do you recall how you 1st learned even even if it was vague.

177  
0:24:36  
P11  
Oh, goodness, no, I I really don't. I mean, I might have read a news story, or I I couldn't tell you.

178  
0:24:43  
Emily  
Okay, no problem. Alright. So we're gonna pretend that this was built in real life, and with all the the things that you had mentioned such as

179  
0:24:57  
Emily  
I'll let you.

180  
0:24:59  
P11  
Oh, let me send them to the voicemail.

181  
0:25:04  
Emily  
Okay.

182  
0:25:05  
P11  
Let me get back in here.

183  
0:25:08  
Emily  
Okay? So yeah. So we're we're gonna pretend that the app was built as is meaning it. Multi like the things you had mentioned. It takes multiple steps to get any help. There's not any direct link to pay. How likely do you think it would be? You would be to use it.

184  
0:25:31  
Emily  
While you're on land, I should say, knowing that it's not not easy otherwise.

185  
0:25:40  
P11  
I mean, I might look it up just to see what I owe, because I'm not aware of a current way to do that within the website,

186  
0:25:49  
P11  
and to get my billing statements if I needed to submit those like. If nothing had showed up in the mail, and I needed a billing statement, or I was curious. If something even got billed or not.

187  
0:26:03  
P11  
I would use this simply because there's no other way to do it, but

188  
0:26:08  
P11  
I would definitely prefer, if it was just in a section of the website.

189  
0:26:14  
Emily  
Got it. Okay?

190  
0:26:16  
Emily  
And then I know you had mentioned like having the the statement. Pdfs, to be useful if you were looking at older statements. Where would you expect to find those.

191  
0:26:29  
P11  
Oh, goodness!

192  
0:26:33  
P11  
Down here where it says, Pdf. Statements.

193  
0:26:37  
Emily  
Okay. Thoughts on the clarity of that. How easy or difficult it would be to find those.

194  
0:26:46  
P11  
I would just change the label and say something like

195  
0:26:50  
P11  
previous statements or older statements, or something. That's that's what I'm used to seeing like on financial websites. Or you know, my cell phone bill, or something like that.

196  
0:27:01  
Emily  
Okay, makes sense.

197  
0:27:03  
Emily  
Okay, let me have you tap the payments. Button on the lower right i'm going to get you to a slightly different section. Okay? And then scroll all the way to the bottom. And then the blank gray area. Tap into that once

198  
0:27:17  
Emily  
beautiful. Okay, scroll down and tap back into copays.

199  
0:27:22  
Emily  
All right. So again, slightly different. Here again, we're going to look at the James A. Haley hospital again if you want to tap into that, and just see

200  
0:27:33  
Emily  
how how this, how this one compares in terms of the information you would want and the things you might want to be able to do from here.

201  
0:27:45  
P11  
So this is interesting that you can copy the account number, because when you go over to the

202  
0:27:51  
P11  
unless, it's changed in the past couple of months. When you go to the Va. Or P. Sorry pay.gov website, you have to individually enter each collection of numbers and letters.

203  
0:28:03  
P11  
so I don't know that it helps that you can copy. Because even if you go over to that website, you have to individually enter, you can't just paste everything into one box.

204  
0:28:12  
Emily  
Yes, the the hope is that that you will

205  
0:28:14  
Emily  
be able to paste once, and it entering into all 5 boxes. But let let's pretend that does actually work that way.

206  
0:28:22  
P11  
Oh, that would be helpful, I, like that, you can hit pay bill, yeah, that's nice

207  
0:28:48  
Emily  
So for the the the payment. Let me have you walk me through what? And again, I'm not going to have you enter any actual information, I promise, but walk me through what you would do if you were, let's say, ready to make a payment on this particular bill.

208  
0:29:06  
P11  
So I would go to pay Bill here, and then I would tap the one that says Pay on pay.gov.

209  
0:29:10  
Emily  
Okay. And and you can go ahead and do that.

210  
0:29:20  
Emily  
And I'm just gonna have you scroll down. I'm not. Gonna have you read anything. Yeah, and go to continue to the form.

211  
0:29:27  
Emily  
all right and scroll down. So yeah, so I know you said, there's there are the 5 parts to the account. Number.

212  
0:29:35  
P11  
Yeah, so I would. Sorry. I would wish that like this should all be pre filled for me.

213  
0:29:40  
Emily  
Oh, got it? Okay.

214  
0:29:42  
P11  
Right cause. It's tedious. Why should I have to re-enter all of this or that? If I enter my account number that then that would pre fill it.

215  
0:29:52  
Emily  
Hmm,

216  
0:29:54  
P11  
It's very tedious to enter all this, and then I'm always worried that I've like entered something the wrong way.

217  
0:30:02  
Emily  
Okay, all right. So you want things pre-filled.

218  
0:30:05  
P11  
Yeah, I mean, still, the ability to edit it if you needed to, but just like to prompt, that's pre-filled. And then the other thing that's always I've found annoying is the Payment information section.

219  
0:30:16  
P11  
I think it should be similar to like. When you get your credit card bill, you try to pay your credit card bill online. So you have an option where it's like current balance, last statement balance, or you can enter some other amount or like minimum payment or something. It should give you some prompts, because again.

220  
0:30:35  
P11  
one of the issues that I've had is like, I pay off the most recent bill. But then it turns out there were other charges on there, and I have to go back in and pay. It's like I just want to pay everything at once, like it's just. It's a pain in the ass to keep going back and like making more payments. I just want, however much it is. I just want to pay it.

221  
0:30:54  
Emily  
That makes that makes sense.

222  
0:30:56  
P11  
So, being able to prompt some options, would, I think, be very helpful.

223  
0:31:02  
Emily  
Okay, I'm gonna have you switch back to the figma app and let's see if figma

224  
0:31:07  
Emily  
sleep. Okay, so tap on, go back and then close.

225  
0:31:12  
Emily  
So any other thoughts. I know you certainly already explained. You would want things pre-filled. You'd want the amount to give you the options of specific amounts any other thoughts, especially regarding flipping back and forth between an app and then a browser to get to pay.gov.

226  
0:31:33  
P11  
I mean.

227  
0:31:34  
P11  
right? We're supposed to be in like a digital age. It would be nice to just pay in the app like, have it linked to pay.gov. And so it you're just doing everything in the app. My other question is that if you're gonna pay your bill, say, by, I think these other options like phone or mail, if you're gonna pay by phone like.

228  
0:31:55  
P11  
does it immediately connect you to somebody? Or does it just take you to some endless phone tree, and you have to push a million buttons and hope to God that you'll reach someone before like you heel over and die. I.

229  
0:32:06  
Emily  
Okay, got it?

230  
0:32:08  
P11  
What? Well.

231  
0:32:09  
P11  
I would want it what I would. If I'm gonna pay by phone, I would want it to like

232  
0:32:14  
P11  
like immediately connect me to the billing department, and then, not just like in the background, have me on hold, and then like, notify me when somebody's there. Not that I have to really do anything, or wait around, or whatever.

233  
0:32:31  
P11  
Yeah.

234  
0:32:31  
Emily  
It's I should tap on pay by phone. I I don't actually remember what the information. Okay, so it's 3.

235  
0:32:37  
P11  
It's very unhelpful. Okay.

236  
0:32:40  
Emily  
So you you'd wanna know that you're specifically calling the billing department.

237  
0:32:45  
P11  
Yeah, I mean, I think it should connect me like one touch, right? I've already told them that I want to pay my bill. It should be that I just push once, and it

238  
0:32:55  
P11  
like contact me immediately.

239  
0:32:57  
Emily  
Okay.

240  
0:32:58  
P11  
To the right person, and maybe has some kind of pop up that says, like your estimated hold, time is X amount.

241  
0:33:06  
Emily  
Hmm, okay, got it.

242  
0:33:09  
Emily  
I'll maybe tap back there, all right, great. So, again, i'll ask this question, like, I did before pretending that things were built like you're seeing here.

243  
0:33:21  
Emily  
How? What's the likelihood that you would use it with things being as they are here.

244  
0:33:37  
P11  
yeah, I again like, since I have to enter all this stuff by hand on the pay.gov website, it's faster for me to do that when I have a keyboard than to like do it all with my thumbs on a phone. So

245  
0:33:52  
P11  
I

246  
0:33:53  
P11  
you know the value of having a little mobile device like this and having apps is that everything should be more streamlined and interconnected, and you shouldn't have to be typing long essays with your thumbs. So yeah, I don't know that I would be doing

247  
0:34:08  
P11  
that.

248  
0:34:10  
Emily  
Okay, got it. And then how about comparing this version? Or I'm gonna have you compare this version versus the previous one that didn't have any payment link

249  
0:34:20  
Emily  
like. Which which one do you think you might be more likely to use.

250  
0:34:25  
P11  
Yeah, I mean, this one definitely has more features, useful features. So that's good.

251  
0:34:31  
P11  
This is an improvement.

252  
0:34:32  
Emily  
Alright, good.

253  
0:34:35  
Emily  
Alright sounds good. And any other thoughts on could be the labeling, or just any other information presented here that we haven't already gone over.

254  
0:34:54  
P11  
I think this part where it says, pay or request help is kind of useless.

255  
0:34:59  
Emily  
Hmm, okay.

256  
0:35:00  
P11  
Because

257  
0:35:01  
P11  
I would expect that if I click on this down arrow right? It says, pay or request help by July 30.th

258  
0:35:09  
P11  
Well, then, I open it, and it just says you have to pay a request help by July 30.th That's not adding any value to this. If I click the down button especially. They put it like big, and it's a big deal.

259  
0:35:21  
P11  
and they have a down button. I would expect the down button to say 2 things pay or request help right? Because that's what it's saying. Pay or request help. Otherwise, if it's just going to repeat what it's already said, I wouldn't make a down button. I would have it as a banner. That's like your your bill is due by, you know.

260  
0:35:42  
P11  
If I'm going to open this up, I want it to. Then give me those 2 options. Either pay it, or here's a 1 click button that, you know takes me to someone that can help me with

261  
0:35:52  
P11  
a payment plan. Yeah.

262  
0:35:55  
Emily  
No, that makes sense. Got it? And then

263  
0:35:59  
Emily  
compare what you're seeing here to. So I forget when, if you are logging into the website. Are you finding this type of information there? I know you said you're you're often calling them.

264  
0:36:12  
P11  
Yeah, I have done now. Maybe it's changed in the past couple of months, so if so, then I'm not up to speed, but as of, say, 3 plus months ago.

265  
0:36:24  
P11  
I would. I like, searched and searched and searched and searched and searched, and could not find anything, and finally made some phone calls, and they said, Oh, it's a future capability.

266  
0:36:34  
Emily  
Okay, got it

267  
0:36:36  
Emily  
all right. Let me have you tap on payments again on the lower right? I'm gonna have you go. So we're gonna pretend that you do have an overpayment debt. Only if you tap into that section and thoughts on what you're seeing here in terms of information that would be useful for you regarding the debts.

268  
0:37:08  
P11  
I think this one here

269  
0:37:10  
P11  
where it says disability, compensation, and pension debt. We're reducing your benefits each month until your debt is paid. I think that's too vague. I think it should say right here, like

270  
0:37:23  
P11  
we're taking $50 out of each paycheck until it's paid it. Expect it to be paid off by this date, if you you know, if you don't

271  
0:37:33  
P11  
send us more money or something, because I've had

272  
0:37:37  
P11  
God bless the Federal Government! But they screw up my pay a lot for my civilian pay, and so sometimes they have, like an overpayment that that they are taking out of my paycheck, and it says they're like, you know, we're gonna take $500 out of each paycheck for the next 5 paychecks until this is paid off. Here's the total amount. Here's what's remaining, and that way you can at least plan

273  
0:38:01  
P11  
like you know what your take home pay is going to be. So I think, especially for people who are getting disability, compensation or Va pensions. Those are usually people with pretty small incomes, and so they would want to know. It would be extremely important to them how much money is coming out of each check, and for how long.

274  
0:38:22  
Emily  
Okay, so be super specific on what is being what is being taken out, just how long that will, that will last.

275  
0:38:28  
P11  
Correct.

276  
0:38:29  
Emily  
Got it. Okay, and maybe scroll to the top. We're going to look at one specific one, the Gi bill debt for housing, what information, and you can tap into it if you'd like, yeah, information that would be useful here if you had. If you had this debt.

277  
0:38:53  
P11  
Are these links live? Can I open the letters.

278  
0:38:56  
Emily  
Nothing is live here. But what would you expect to be? To be able to do.

279  
0:39:03  
P11  
I would want to know like where this came from, because there's a thing that says, Why might I have this debt? Well, that just sounds like some generic information that's not specific to me. I would want to know exactly why like how this came to be which I assume is in these demand letters at the bottom.

280  
0:39:25  
P11  
but yeah, I'd want to know exactly how they came to calculate it, because sometimes, like you get Gi. Bill housing overpayments if you know you didn't take enough classes, one semester or something, and so maybe it's possible that their records are wrong.

281  
0:39:44  
P11  
I mean, maybe I actually owe them the money. But oftentimes there's some sort of communication problem. So I would want to know exactly what's going on here, so that I would know if it

282  
0:39:56  
P11  
if it's real or not like, if it's accurate or not.

283  
0:40:00  
Emily  
Yeah, okay? And and you would you would expect to find that in the debt letters, or was it somewhere else you would expect to find that information.

284  
0:40:07  
P11  
Well, I think this. Why might I have? This debt is useless. I don't. I don't want like speculative, or some like dissertation on why people might have housing debt like I just want to know why I have housing debt.

285  
0:40:21  
Emily  
Sure.

286  
0:40:22  
P11  
And maybe how I could prevent it in the future if it was. For example, you know the the timing of of classes or something. Maybe there's a way I could stack my classes, so I don't have this type of debt in the future.

287  
0:40:36  
Emily  
Okay, got it? Got it alright. And

288  
0:40:42  
Emily  
we're going to pretend so like, let's say you don't believe you owe this this debt, for whatever reason. What would be your next step?

289  
0:40:56  
P11  
I mean, it says here, resolve, debt. I don't know what that means. I would want to say like dispute, debt.

290  
0:41:03  
P11  
cause resolve sounds to me like some sort of payment.

291  
0:41:08  
P11  
and if I don't believe that I owe it in the 1st place, I don't.

292  
0:41:14  
P11  
I don't really see an easy place where I could dispute it. That's the word I would look for is dispute.

293  
0:41:20  
Emily  
Okay. So billing for a dispute. Okay.

294  
0:41:23  
Emily  
how about if you

295  
0:41:26  
Emily  
we're pretty sure you do owe it. But just need to need need some help with extending the payments. Where might you? Or what? What would be your next step in that situation?

296  
0:41:37  
P11  
See again. I'd want to be able to push down on this

297  
0:41:41  
P11  
drop down and have a button that says like payment plan, or you know, because it says request financial help. But then there's no obvious place here where you can actually do that. So that's just annoying, like you need to request help. But, haha! We're not going to tell you how to do it.

298  
0:42:02  
Emily  
All right. Got it?

299  
0:42:04  
Emily  
So let's pretend that you are ready to make a payment. What would you do in that case?

300  
0:42:12  
P11  
I guess.

301  
0:42:16  
P11  
Gosh!

302  
0:42:18  
P11  
I don't like this word resolve.

303  
0:42:20  
Emily  
Hmm! I.

304  
0:42:21  
P11  
Feel like it should be broken down into like, make a payment, request, help, dispute, charge.

305  
0:42:34  
Emily  
thoughts on, yeah, on, on what? You what? Your what? Your steps would be. If you if you do want to make the payment.

306  
0:42:41  
P11  
I would go to this route. Yeah, resolve debt and pay online.

307  
0:42:47  
Emily  
Okay.

308  
0:42:48  
P11  
I just don't.

309  
0:42:50  
P11  
I would break it down here.

310  
0:42:52  
Emily  
Okay, you want.

311  
0:42:53  
P11  
Instead of like you tap on it first, st and then you get these.

312  
0:42:56  
P11  
I I would say I would break it down right here and have it like, make payment.

313  
0:43:03  
P11  
dispute, debt, like request, payment, plan, or something, or request. What does this say?

314  
0:43:10  
P11  
Request help? That's kind of vague. Yeah, I would have like request, financial assistance, or something like that.

315  
0:43:18  
Emily  
Okay, got it.

316  
0:43:20  
P11  
Request. Help is really vague like that could be anything from.

317  
0:43:24  
P11  
I don't know why I have this bill to. I need to set up a payment plan to like. Is there some sort of grant or forgiveness? Or it could be any of those things.

318  
0:43:34  
Emily  
Okay, got it? Let me have you go to that that request help

319  
0:43:44  
P11  
see that's what I was looking for

320  
0:43:48  
Emily  
so it sounds like you would want each of these things broken out on the previous page.

321  
0:43:54  
P11  
M.

322  
0:43:55  
P11  
Yeah, or at least like a link that takes me to the next page. That shows me this information.

323  
0:44:02  
Emily  
Okay, got it.

324  
0:44:14  
Emily  
And then so yeah, any any further thoughts on that. Besides that, you'd want that sooner rather than having to go through. Request help 1st to get here.

325  
0:44:27  
P11  
I mean, my other thought is just right. The the government is very lumbering. And if you compare this, say to a credit card website.

326  
0:44:37  
P11  
There's not so many steps involved, right? Like request, a payment plan. Well, here's 6 million ways. You can talk to somebody like

327  
0:44:45  
P11  
it should just be like request, a payment plan. All right, let's start doing the steps of it, you know, or like dispute this debt. Well, now, there's some whole other process like it.

328  
0:44:58  
P11  
The there shouldn't be so many steps. If I've already said I want to dispute it. I should immediately be able to, whether it's file a form or talk to a human being chat or on the phone like it should just take me right there. I don't. There's too many steps.

329  
0:45:15  
Emily  
Okay, got it. Let me have you close that

330  
0:45:20  
Emily  
and then, yeah, close that, tap into review, details

331  
0:45:26  
Emily  
and then let me, have you? Pretend that you are gonna pay? I just want to get you through the

332  
0:45:33  
Emily  
yeah. Go to pay online. There we go.

333  
0:45:48  
Emily  
Now, have have you been to this site before.

334  
0:45:55  
Emily  
Happen.

335  
0:45:55  
P11  
Don't think so.

336  
0:45:57  
Emily  
Okay, got it. So let me just have you. The the pay online button, the teal one on the lower left.

337  
0:46:04  
Emily  
Tap into that and then scroll down.

338  
0:46:10  
Emily  
Yeah. So the the section where there are a bunch of form or fields to fill out. Rather, yeah thoughts on the required fields here, and just how easy or difficult would be to to find that information.

339  
0:46:27  
P11  
Yeah, again, I feel like this should be pre-filled, or it should be within the app.

340  
0:46:32  
P11  
It's a pain in the ass to go back and forth between the 2, and like which deduction code and God bless the government! There's it's just way too complicated.

341  
0:46:43  
Emily  
Got it. Okay, let me have you switch back to the figma app.

342  
0:46:48  
Emily  
There we go. And yeah, just hit go back.

343  
0:46:51  
P11  
Like the way to fix the government is not to fire all the people. It's to like streamline operations.

344  
0:47:01  
Emily  
So so, even though it is not the easiest to go back and forth thoughts on the information here, and and knowing you would, you would have to be entering this information over in the the payment site.

345  
0:47:19  
P11  
Yeah.

346  
0:47:23  
P11  
I don't know. I'm trying to think of a way to make this easier, like a button that would let me screenshot it or.

347  
0:47:31  
Emily  
Okay.

348  
0:47:32  
P11  
Or something, so that, or maybe just say like, make it clearer, like

349  
0:47:41  
P11  
the form does not pre fill. So you'll either need to write this down or toggle back and forth just to warn me, because, honestly, I would probably just write all this down on a piece of paper, so I don't have to toggle back and forth.

350  
0:47:54  
Emily  
Okay. So so specifically call out that the form was not, will not remember this information.

351  
0:48:00  
P11  
Yeah, like, it says you'll need to provide these details. But.

352  
0:48:05  
P11  
I think I'm not really fully grasping that I need to write everything down, or that I'm going to need to toggle back and forth in the digital age. I'm like, yeah, yeah, okay, right? Just take me to like where I put my credit card information in, you know, and to then have to like. It's not even a mobile enabled website, like the type is super small. I got to zoom in.

353  
0:48:31  
Emily  
Yeah, yeah, okay, got it. That makes sense.

354  
0:48:35  
Emily  
Any any other thoughts regarding anything we we've seen here that you haven't mentioned in regards to finances. Here.

355  
0:48:46  
P11  
Where it says, Pay online before I get deep into the weeds of pay.gov. I think it would be useful to say

356  
0:48:53  
P11  
on this page what your payment options are like on pay.gov, you can use a credit card you can use. Ach! You can use what right like I think it should tell you right here so that you're not.

357  
0:49:07  
P11  
You don't go through some laborious process and then find out that whatever method you thought you were going to use for payment isn't even accepted, because within pay.gov, depending on the agency and the type of payment you're making, there's different options like, sometimes you can pay with a credit card, sometimes you can't, sometimes you can use Paypal, sometimes you can't. So I think it should be obvious here. So you're not wasting time or so that you can get your information ready before you go down another rabbit hole.

358  
0:49:37  
Emily  
Okay, so prepare you more for what exactly is gonna happen next, and what you need to need to have.

359  
0:49:43  
P11  
Yeah, like what your financial options are. Because, say, for example, you plan to pay by credit card, and it says on this page, credit cards not accepted. Well, then, you probably have to go like you're not even ready to make that payment. It might be a few days, because maybe you have to move money between accounts, or maybe you decide you're just going to write a check, or maybe right like, if you're one. If you were planning to pay by one method, and that method's not available. You're probably not ready to pay.

360  
0:50:12  
Emily  
Yep. Makes sense.

361  
0:50:13  
Emily  
Okay. Any any other thoughts here?

362  
0:50:20  
P11  
I think that's good.

363  
0:50:22  
P11  
Okay, I do.

364  
0:50:23  
P11  
I would. I don't know. It, says person entitled, maybe that's the exact language used on the Va website.

365  
0:50:33  
P11  
That to me that's confusing, I would say, like beneficiary. Maybe.

366  
0:50:37  
Emily  
Okay. Yeah.

367  
0:50:41  
Emily  
Okay.

368  
0:50:42  
P11  
Person who received, or the person who owes the money, or the person who's account, or like account holder. Maybe.

369  
0:50:50  
P11  
Yeah.

370  
0:50:52  
Emily  
Okay. So you want that spelled out a little more clearly.

371  
0:50:55  
P11  
Unless that's specifically the title of the box. Then I'm gonna fill in over@pay.gov got it?

372  
0:51:02  
P11  
Yeah.

373  
0:51:03  
Emily  
Okay.

374  
0:51:05  
Emily  
I'm going to check in with my colleagues if they have any other questions. If anybody does, you're welcome to unmute and ask. Now.

375  
0:51:21  
Emily  
okay, I'll take that as a no, that those are all my questions. I really appreciate your time. This is, it's always super important to talk directly with veterans and understand their experiences, and got lots of very thorough information from you. So thank you for being so detailed and all of your feedback. It is going to be very helpful. And I

376  
0:51:42  
Emily  
thank you for your time. I know I know Paragene is going to be reaching out to you soon, regarding next steps on their end, but otherwise I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day.

377  
0:51:54  
P11  
Alright. Thank you so much. I'm really. I know there were some contract disruptions. I'm glad those got ironed out, and you guys are still out there doing this stuff and.

378  
0:52:01  
Emily  
Nice.

379  
0:52:02  
P11  
It's reassuring to know there's still people like software engineers on the staff. So thank you very much. I mean, it's very. It may seem like somebody's, you know, pork project. But these sorts of things really do make it life a lot easier for veterans.

380  
0:52:19  
Emily  
Well, I appreciate you telling us that.

381  
0:52:20  
P11  
Thank you so much. Have a good day.

382  
0:52:23  
Emily  
Bye-bye.
