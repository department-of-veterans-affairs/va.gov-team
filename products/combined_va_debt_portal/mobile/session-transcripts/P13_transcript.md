3  
0:00:09  
P13  
Sure.

4  
0:00:10  
Emily  
Okay, great. And are you okay? If I potentially share any clips to our Va partners from this today.

0:00:16  
P13  
That's fine!

6  
0:00:17  
Emily  
Okay, great, thank you.

7  
0:00:18  
Emily  
Okay. So now we'll get started. So I'd like to know, just in whatever you're comfortable sharing anything about yourself as a veteran could be the branch you served when you retired or separated, etc.

8  
0:00:33  
P13  
Yeah, I was in [redacted] from 73 to 77.

9  
0:00:38  
Emily  
Okay, great. And what sort of experience have you had with the Va. Since then?

10  
0:00:46  
P13  
I think it started. Probably

11  
0:00:50  
P13  
yeah, 96 or so I had [redacted - health issue

13  
0:01:03  
Emily  
Oh, goodness!

14  
0:01:04  
P13  
Been using them ever since.

15  
0:01:06  
Emily  
Wow, all right. And what? Hopefully, that healed okay for you.

16  
0:01:13  
P13  
[redacted] are still in there.

17  
0:01:16  
Emily  
Well, that's yeah. They've lasted a good while. So it's great.

18  
0:01:21  
Emily  
And then what sort of experience have you had? If any, with the Va website, and or mobile app.

19  
0:01:28  
P13  
The the website. I use quite a bit check or order medications. Check on appointments. Things of that nature.

20  
0:01:36  
Emily  
Okay, great. And have you used the mobile app at all?

21  
0:01:40  
P13  
No, very rarely.

22  
0:01:42  
Emily  
Okay? When when you say rarely, what? What have you used it for?

23  
0:01:47  
P13  
I think this is actually the 1st time I'm normally on my laptop.

24  
0:01:53  
Emily  
Okay.

25  
0:01:53  
P13  
So the the mobile app I downloaded it, and I think I I checked it, maybe once, just to make sure it worked, and other than that really haven't used it.

26  
0:02:05  
Emily  
Okay, got it? Got it? Any any thoughts on if you might ever or like what's what might be preventing you from from using the app.

27  
0:02:15  
P13  
It's just more convenient plus the the screen is a lot larger and easier to manage on the laptop than mobile.

28  
0:02:23  
Emily  
Okay, got it. Larger screen. Okay? So now we're going to move into the financial portion of the discussion. And I want to make sure you're only sharing what you're willing. I have 0 information about any finance, anything related or anything related to you and the Va. So first, st have you had any experience with owing the Va. Money for any overpayment debts.

29  
0:02:48  
P13  
Yeah, I think this was about 2 years ago I had been getting a a va pension.

30  
0:02:58  
P13  
What they didn't tell me at the time I had been approved for social security, disability

31  
0:03:07  
P13  
and a va pension within months of each other. I don't remember which came 1st and which followed, but

32  
0:03:15  
P13  
at the time I think it was about 58 when I started getting social security disability.

33  
0:03:22  
P13  
Well, nobody ever told me that at 65. The disability payments change to retirement payments which makes the VA Pension income.

34  
0:03:34  
Emily  
Hmm, okay.

35  
0:03:35  
P13  
So at that point there was about 2 years worth of income from the Va. That they wanted to collect that was considered overpayments.

36  
0:03:48  
Emily  
Oh, got it? Okay.

37  
0:03:49  
P13  
Yeah, I think it was somewhere around [redacted - large amount]

38  
0:03:53  
Emily  
Oh, my goodness! Got it!

39  
0:03:56  
Emily  
And.

40  
0:03:56  
P13  
Well, yeah, I had.

41  
0:04:00  
P13  
I think this whole process was online, or pretty much all of it. I submitted a waiver, and I told them. You know what the the situation and circumstances were, and they ended up waiving the entire amount.

42  
0:04:16  
Emily  
Oh, wow!

43  
0:04:17  
P13  
So yeah, I mean, blew me away. But yeah, thank you.

44  
0:04:21  
P13  
You god

45  
0:04:22  
Emily  
Yeah, wow, do you recall how you initially learned about this? About the the dev.

46  
0:04:29  
P13  
A letter in the mail.

47  
0:04:30  
Emily  
Got it? Got it?

48  
0:04:33  
Emily  
And then how

49  
0:04:36  
Emily  
So you said any had. Could could there have been any way that things could have been made easier. From from the Va. Side with that whole.

50  
0:04:44  
P13  
Yeah. If either the Va. Or social security had let me know at 65 that my status was changing, there would have been some time to make arrangements, but you know, just not knowing that having it happen. And then, 2 years later, coming back to collect over payments, it's, you know that's a hard thing to deal with.

51  
0:05:08  
Emily  
Yeah, that I would agree. Yeah. And so when you when you had 1st called them

52  
0:05:14  
Emily  
were had you? What was what was your thought? On what? What might be able to happen when you were 1st reaching out to them?

53  
0:05:22  
P13  
Well, I did use the Va. And Google quite a bit to find out what my options were. I think they had mentioned something in in the letter that I could apply for a waiver of overpayment. So yeah, I followed up with that. And after I think maybe 6 months, 8 months somewhere around there. I got the letter back from saying that they had waived.

54  
0:05:51  
Emily  
Got it okay? And before. And I. So you said in the letter, it said there was a possibility that you could apply for a waiver. Had you known prior to that that there was any sort of option like that? No, you didn't. Okay.

55  
0:06:03  
P13  
Let me go!

56  
0:06:04  
Emily  
Got it.

57  
0:06:05  
Emily  
Well, I'm glad for you that it was. That's great news. And then on a different financial aspect. Do you have experience with medical Copays through the BA.

58  
0:06:19  
P13  
Yeah. Once the they. They withdrew the payments for a pension. I had been in, I think they call it Group 3,

59  
0:06:31  
P13  
where there were no medical copayments charged. And once I didn't have the pension anymore that took me out of that group, and then they started charging me co-payments which eventually

60  
0:06:44  
P13  
you know, I asked them to waive those, and eventually, I got

61  
0:06:50  
P13  
applied for when I got an aid and assistance pension which took away the medical copay

62  
0:06:58  
Emily  
Oh, okay, got it. So you were so for a little bit you were had to pay. But but then.

63  
0:07:02  
P13  
Yeah, I think for about a year.

64  
0:07:05  
Emily  
Okay, got it? Got it? And do you recall like, while you were receiving these bills? How like how you were getting these bills.

65  
0:07:15  
P13  
It. Yeah.

66  
0:07:20  
P13  
they would send me

67  
0:07:24  
P13  
I think they sent me something through the mail and through

68  
0:07:29  
P13  
Internet. I believe it was called. It's been a while I believe. They would tell me I owed a certain amount and give me a itemized list of the medications and what the co-pays were, and and then there's they let me know about pay.gov.

69  
0:07:50  
P13  
Which was how I could pay the co-payments. So I did that for a while, and

70  
0:07:56  
P13  
eventually, when they did give me the new pension. There were no more co-payments to pay.

71  
0:08:03  
Emily  
Okay, got it. So so you were. You were always paying them when you were you were you were paying them through pay.gov.

72  
0:08:09  
P13  
Yes, sir.

73  
0:08:10  
Emily  
Okay, got it. And do you recall like,

74  
0:08:15  
Emily  
What prompted you to make the payment each time? If it was only yeah, if there was, if you were waiting for something particular of your.

75  
0:08:22  
P13  
Yeah, it's just some at the end of the month. It was just one of the things that I added to you know to. It's gotta be taken care of. So.

76  
0:08:31  
Emily  
Okay, and and we're.

77  
0:08:33  
P13  
I just went down the list pretty much of creditors or bills. I had and they were in the list, so I just added them on.

78  
0:08:45  
Emily  
Okay? And were you did you get a bill each month?

79  
0:08:49  
P13  
Yes, ma'am.

80  
0:08:50  
Emily  
Good. Okay, got it. And was that you said that was a physical letter, or I forget if you also said if there was something online.

81  
0:08:56  
P13  
It was physically.

82  
0:08:58  
Emily  
Great, all right. And then considering so so since you, you have had experience both with the medical Copays and with the overpayment benefits.

83  
0:09:12  
Emily  
Thought, were you

84  
0:09:14  
Emily  
thinking of those in in a similar way? Or do those seem like like very, very different categories to you like, what's your.

85  
0:09:23  
P13  
So yeah, they were different categories, but they they both came about from a

86  
0:09:31  
P13  
the same source, which was the the pension overpayments and the removal of the pension.

87  
0:09:37  
Emily  
Oh, got it.

88  
0:09:39  
Emily  
Okay? Makes sense.

89  
0:09:41  
Emily  
Okay, so let me have you go ahead and share your screen and let me know if you need help doing that.

90  
0:09:47  
P13  
Yeah. I don't know how to do that.

91  
0:09:49  
Emily  
So do so. Tap once in, like in the general middle of your screen, and toward the bottom there should be a little button that says, Share.

92  
0:10:01  
P13  
Okay.

93  
0:10:03  
P13  
Who am I sharing? Let me.

94  
0:10:06  
Emily  
So share screen. That should be an option.

95  
0:10:18  
Emily  
Okay, it's starting. There we go, and we are there all right. And and let me have you say, are you? Are you able to to rotate the phone so that it's it's vertical. I think it might be a little easier to

96  
0:10:32  
Emily  
look at things that way. Let's see, like it's there we go. It's catching up perfect. Thank you. And now I'm going to have you open up the app figma and let me know if you need help to open up a different app.

97  
0:10:47  
Emily  
Okay, you're getting it.

98  
0:10:57  
Emily  
And I'm gonna give. Okay. So go to login to figma.

99  
0:11:01  
Emily  
I'm going to give you some credentials here.

100  
0:11:06  
Emily  
Okay, the email will be [redacted]

101  
0:11:15  
Emily  
[redacted] are still in there.

102  
0:11:29  
Emily  
Okay? And then the password is [redacted]

103  
0:11:44  
Emily  
Okay. And right? So we don't. No, no need to save that.

104  
0:11:49  
P13  
Alright, and then I gotta give you the code. So now, in the where it says authentication code 9, 8 0.

105  
0:11:59  
Emily  
5, 9, 3, 3.

106  
0:12:05  
Emily  
Okay, yeah. Log in great, make sure that. Okay? And then continue with mobile app.

107  
0:12:14  
Emily  
Okay, wait for them to make sure that opens

108  
0:12:20  
Emily  
alright. That's good. And then I'm gonna send you a link. So that should so a link should be. If you if you can open up zoom in the chat of zoom. There is a link that I just sent you.

109  
0:12:40  
Emily  
I think, to the right. Oh, no, I'm sorry to the left. Sorry I just saw it.

110  
0:12:46  
Emily  
and I think it was one to the right was zoom? Oh, sorry sorry to the the zoom application. So go back and and tap the little 3 bars at the bottom. Left again.

111  
0:13:00  
Emily  
Yeah, and then let's see swipe one to the No. Go the other way. I just saw it keep going.

112  
0:13:08  
Emily  
Keep going there. Oh, right. We just want one past it. So go back the other way.

113  
0:13:13  
Emily  
Right there. Okay, tap on that.

114  
0:13:16  
Emily  
Wait for that to load up alright and then tap once in the middle

115  
0:13:23  
Emily  
alright, and then the where the little red circle is at the bottom. That's the chat. Let me have you tap on that.

116  
0:13:36  
Emily  
That will. Okay, and then tap this very long URL here.

117  
0:13:42  
Emily  
and that should okay, that will open up. Figma. Great! I know it's a bunch of steps here. All right. It's working good.

118  
0:13:50  
Emily  
Just let it load here sometimes. Takes a moment.

119  
0:14:08  
Emily  
Yeah, see, it's working

120  
0:14:27  
Emily  
all right. Great. So you can tap just anywhere outside of the where it says tap and hold, there we go, great, all right. So here we have the your pretend mobile app here. So we're going to pretend in this situation that you do, in fact, have both medical copays and the overpayment debt. Don't yet tap on anything, but if you want to scroll around, that's fine. What would be your assumption on where you would find that information about the overpayment debts and the Copays.

121  
0:14:58  
P13  
I believe it's called my va.gov.

122  
0:15:02  
P13  
or V va.gov? And then my Va.

123  
0:15:07  
P13  
I believe it's how I usually get to it.

124  
0:15:10  
Emily  
Okay? So if you're so we're on, we're we're gonna pretend we're actually on the the mobile app and from from here, where? Where would you assume to find it, or expect to find.

125  
0:15:27  
P13  
I guess, under where it says latest payment.

126  
0:15:31  
Emily  
Okay, got it?

127  
0:15:33  
Emily  
Any, any other sections you might. You might expect to find that information.

128  
0:15:38  
P13  
Possibly claims.

129  
0:15:43  
P13  
And maybe even message it.

130  
0:15:45  
Emily  
Okay, message. Got it? Okay? So I'm gonna send you where? We're actually looking to putting it at the at the very bottom. The lower right, where it says payments at the there's there's there's 4 marks or sorry 4 tabs at the very bottom.

131  
0:16:02  
P13  
I'm doing.

132  
0:16:02  
Emily  
Yeah. Yeah. So tap on into where it says, payments.

133  
0:16:07  
Emily  
Yep, there we go. Thoughts on that section where I just sent you. I know it wasn't something that you that you thought of going. But yeah, any any thoughts on placing things here.

134  
0:16:19  
P13  
Yeah, it's a it's shows overpayment debts and co-pays.

135  
0:16:24  
Emily  
Okay.

136  
0:16:26  
Emily  
thoughts on does this make sense that you that you might find things under this payment section.

137  
0:16:34  
P13  
Yeah, sure. Absolutely.

138  
0:16:35  
Emily  
Okay, got it.

139  
0:16:38  
Emily  
And then, looking at this page overall, thought, I know you. You, of course, found the overpayments and copays, but thoughts on the information presented here on on what make, on the clarity of things.

140  
0:16:55  
P13  
Yeah, this is you pretty much told me everything I need to know about my payments when the payments are where they're being deposited, and you know what I owe.

141  
0:17:06  
Emily  
Okay, okay, got it. And thoughts on the on combining both. In this situation, payments that would be coming to you, and payments that need to be made on one page. Thoughts on.

142  
0:17:20  
P13  
Yeah, that that well, I could see how that might be a little confusing at times.

143  
0:17:28  
P13  
especially if you're not really, you know, thinking too clearly.

144  
0:17:35  
P13  
But yeah, from what I can see, it's it's separated pretty well.

145  
0:17:41  
Emily  
Okay, would. Can you think of anything that might make it? Even more? Clear since you said it, it it could be confusing.

146  
0:17:49  
P13  
I would say. Maybe my color coded the payments to me as far as payment history and direct deposit that might be colored green, and maybe the overpayment debts and copays might be color red.

147  
0:18:04  
Emily  
Oh, got it. Okay?

148  
0:18:06  
Emily  
Makes sense. Okay, and then the the section, the wording. Let's look at where it says Copays, the 250 due for 2 bills under there. Thoughts on what? What sort of information you might want to know from this page, just about any money that you owe.

149  
0:18:25  
P13  
Yeah, I would want to have something like the Va. Letters that they sent me for copayments due, which itemized the medications. How much? Copay, for each one was.

150  
0:18:42  
Emily  
okay, got it? Would from from this page. So before you dive into that would there be anything else you would want to know beyond the amount that is due, and how many bills you currently have.

151  
0:18:57  
P13  
Well, yeah, I'd like to know how to how to do the

152  
0:19:02  
P13  
payments, how to how to make the payments. If you know if I had to do it online do it. Have to mail them in you know. Does this mention anything about the

153  
0:19:14  
P13  
pay.gov, or anything like that?

154  
0:19:17  
Emily  
Hmm, okay, got it? So let me have you. If you wanna explore into this.

155  
0:19:23  
Emily  
let me have you explore and just see for the Copays how clear it is to see how much you currently owe in this pretend scenario.

156  
0:19:32  
P13  
Yeah,

157  
0:19:37  
P13  
it looks like it's showing 3 pill. 3 bills with 2 of them having a balance.

158  
0:19:45  
Emily  
Okay, got it.

159  
0:19:47  
Emily  
And

160  
0:19:49  
Emily  
for this this top on the James A, Haley hospital in tampa, what sort of information would you want to know regarding this particular bill.

161  
0:20:02  
P13  
Obviously the amount when the payment is due, and how to make that payment.

162  
0:20:08  
Emily  
Hmm, okay?

163  
0:20:09  
Emily  
And if you if you wanna explore into this and just see, are are you able to find all the information that you just stated that you'd want to know.

164  
0:20:19  
P13  
Yeah. Review details pay by bills. Chose me to pay.gov pay by phone mail or in person.

165  
0:20:27  
Emily  
Okay.

166  
0:20:30  
Emily  
under, since you mentioned the review details, let me have you tap into that and just see is the information under the details is that

167  
0:20:40  
Emily  
is there? Is there more you might need to know for this particular bill.

168  
0:20:48  
P13  
No, it looks looks pretty comprehensive. It shows the the pay bill shows

169  
0:20:55  
P13  
a Pdf statement which I'm guessing is what would be the itemized charges.

170  
0:21:03  
P13  
So.

171  
0:21:04  
P13  
Oh, this one looks pretty comprehensive.

172  
0:21:07  
Emily  
Okay.

173  
0:21:09  
Emily  
got it? For the the Pdf statements. What would you? Can you talk to me about how you might use that.

174  
0:21:21  
P13  
If for example, maybe I I didn't receive a medication or

175  
0:21:31  
P13  
the the medication. Maybe the the amount of the copay change from one month to the next. Yeah, that would be something I would like to know.

176  
0:21:43  
Emily  
Okay, got it.

177  
0:21:45  
Emily  
And would that be something you would? You you might look at on the on, on the phone here.

178  
0:21:54  
P13  
I don't know if I would continue using the phone. To be honest with you, I'd much rather use the laptop to go through this, because it's easier to see to take in all the information from the web page. At one time.

179  
0:22:13  
P13  
This kind of a small screen to do that.

180  
0:22:16  
Emily  
Yeah, no, that certainly makes sense. So acknowledging it is. It is a small screen. Let me have you open up the current statement and let me know if

181  
0:22:28  
Emily  
yeah, thoughts on on that on.

182  
0:22:30  
Emily  
And oh, it might be useful on the phone.

183  
0:22:32  
P13  
Yeah, even with my reading glasses on. That's really small.

184  
0:22:37  
Emily  
Okay, got it? Would you do you think you would? You might do anything else, with this.

185  
0:22:42  
P13  
No! At this point, no.

186  
0:22:44  
Emily  
Okay, okay, got it. Let me have you go ahead and tap done there in the upper left.

187  
0:22:50  
Emily  
Okay, thoughts of let's let's pretend that you saw something on this bill that you're quite sure you did not. Let's say, take, or maybe an appointment. What would be. What would be your next step if you saw something that you believe was an error.

188  
0:23:09  
P13  
I contacted the BA I thought I noticed the number for the the business office, for questions about the bill.

189  
0:23:19  
P13  
So that's where I would go first.st

190  
0:23:21  
Emily  
Okay, where and where? Where would you expect to find that number.

191  
0:23:26  
P13  
I believe, where it should pay. Bill. Nope,

192  
0:23:36  
P13  
hmm!

193  
0:23:39  
P13  
I know I read something about.

194  
0:23:44  
P13  
I don't pay, maybe back to payments.

195  
0:23:47  
Emily  
Okay?

196  
0:23:49  
Emily  
Because where? Yeah, where where would you expect to see it? If if clearly you're, you're, you're not finding something, here, so I'm curious where you would. You would expect to find that number.

197  
0:24:05  
P13  
There we go.

198  
0:24:08  
P13  
Us. Department of Treasury's debt management services at 888-26-3127 to pay this debt. That's the number. I'd go.

199  
0:24:17  
Emily  
Okay, got it? Okay, got it? Would there be any other place? You might look for or look for information for taking a next step. If you saw the error.

200  
0:24:28  
P13  
It. I would hope it would be on the 1st page as soon as I'm

201  
0:24:33  
P13  
you know, check in and finding my build.

202  
0:24:40  
P13  
I'm looking at my bill. I would hope that that number would be available. There.

203  
0:24:46  
Emily  
Okay, you don't want it right here.

204  
0:24:48  
Emily  
It. Okay, let me have you go back into payments and then back to Copays.

205  
0:24:59  
Emily  
Great and let me have you tap on the help section, button on the upper right

206  
0:25:10  
Emily  
and let me know thoughts on information found there.

207  
0:25:17  
P13  
Okay.

208  
0:25:22  
P13  
Yes, this was something that did. You might make that a little bit bigger – it's kind of small.

209  
0:25:30  
Emily  
Oh, got it? Okay.

210  
0:25:32  
Emily  
any anything else that might make it more clear that that would be where you might find information.

211  
0:25:45  
P13  
I I don't know that that you could put anything on on that other page. Aside from actually having the phone number for that management service right there.

212  
0:25:55  
Emily  
Oh, got it? Okay?

213  
0:25:57  
Emily  
Alright and then

214  
0:26:00  
Emily  
Let me have you

215  
0:26:02  
Emily  
open up the if you disagree with Copay debt right here just to see what

216  
0:26:08  
Emily  
if if the information here would be useful for what you might need.

217  
0:26:15  
P13  
Learn how to dispute Va. Copay charges. Sure.

218  
0:26:18  
Emily  
Okay.

219  
0:26:20  
Emily  
Alright great maybe you close this section here on the upper right

220  
0:26:26  
Emily  
great. And then so let's pretend that you are ready to to make a payment here, walk me through what your next steps would be.

221  
0:26:40  
P13  
Well, the 1st thing I do is go to pay Bill.

222  
0:26:43  
Emily  
Okay.

223  
0:26:44  
P13  
And the way I did it was on pay.gov, so I'd go to that.

224  
0:26:49  
Emily  
Okay.

225  
0:26:50  
Emily  
yeah, yeah, you can go ahead and do this. I promise I won't have you add any actual information. There will be no payment taken today.

226  
0:26:56  
P13  
Okay.

227  
0:27:03  
Emily  
And scroll down just a little bit. I'm going to get you to the next section. There's no need to read all this where it says, continue to the form the blue button there.

228  
0:27:14  
Emily  
yep, and then scroll down a little more.

229  
0:27:18  
Emily  
Okay, yeah, a little more. So thoughts on. Yeah. So let's say you are ready to make a payment. And you get to this page while you're on the phone. What would be your next step in terms of finding in terms of of completing the steps.

230  
0:27:35  
P13  
Okay. Well, the way I did it was after I filled it out the 1st time there was a link on the pay.gov web page where

231  
0:27:47  
P13  
It said. If I had filled out the form before, did I want to use that form again? And they filled in all my information for me.

232  
0:27:54  
Emily  
Oh, got it? Got it? Okay? How about if you are doing it for the 1st time.

233  
0:28:01  
P13  
Well, I would need the account number, and that would be on the letter that they send the bill that they send.

234  
0:28:09  
Emily  
Okay, got it?

235  
0:28:10  
P13  
So, yeah, that's 4 part. And I would enter the account number in all 4 parts or 5 parts, I guess.

236  
0:28:17  
Emily  
Yeah, okay, got it. Let me have you switch back to the figma app.

237  
0:28:32  
Emily  
So oh, yeah, try. Yeah. Open up figma again. I can see it on the screen. And the yeah, there we go. Wait for that to load.

238  
0:28:42  
Emily  
Sometimes it likes to close out on. Let's see?

239  
0:28:47  
Emily  
actually, can you switch back to the hold on a second? This happens sometimes. I'm gonna have you switch back to zoom to get a a link. So go to the left. One more that one right there. Yep.

240  
0:29:04  
Emily  
tap on that, and then scroll down. It's I just sent a second link.

241  
0:29:09  
Emily  
So scroll down to the bottom.

242  
0:29:15  
Emily  
Oh, yeah, okay, it's working.

243  
0:29:17  
Emily  
Wait that. Wait for that to open up.

244  
0:29:24  
Emily  
It'll get there.

245  
0:29:27  
P13  
This is the Va. Hurry up and wait.

246  
0:29:31  
Emily  
Well, this isn't a va thing. This is. This is figma. So we can't blame the Va. For this, I promise.

247  
0:29:37  
Emily  
Okay, it's almost there

248  
0:29:44  
Emily  
and then tap just outside of the where it says, tap and hold and then tap on payments again. I'm just going to get you back to exactly where we were. I'll walk you through. Oh, sorry. The the payments on the very lower right?

249  
0:29:57  
Emily  
Yep, and then scroll. Yeah. Okay, perfect. Tap into where it says, co-pays

250  
0:30:04  
Emily  
beautiful and then

251  
0:30:08  
Emily  
tap into the review details. And this is about where we were, I believe, before

252  
0:30:14  
Emily  
for that top one. So yeah, perfect. Okay, okay, so this, we're going to pretend that you just went back to figma thoughts on if you were actually paying your balance

253  
0:30:25  
Emily  
at va sorry not via@uhpay.gov and you wanted to grab your account number. Would there be any use anything useful on on the app here that would help.

254  
0:30:36  
P13  
The copy button. The account number.

255  
0:30:39  
Emily  
Okay. And is that something that easy to find, difficult to find thoughts on, seeing that there.

256  
0:30:48  
P13  
It's it's probably fairly easy to find, but I tend to just stick with what I know works.

257  
0:30:56  
Emily  
Cruise.

258  
0:30:56  
P13  
So yeah, I probably would have had my my bill. Pay my paper bill with me with the account number, but once I got used to this I wouldn't need the paper bill anymore.

259  
0:31:08  
Emily  
Sure. Okay, okay. So you would look at the paper Bill got it all right. So if this were built in real life. And as is what what you just saw in terms of opening up pay.gov how likely do you believe? Do you believe it would be that you might use this.

260  
0:31:28  
P13  
Yep, extremely obviously like, I said, it's it's got the limitations of the small screen.

261  
0:31:37  
P13  
but certainly, if I was let's say I was at the Va. Trying to take care of something. This would be information I would want available.

262  
0:31:47  
Emily  
Okay, got it.

263  
0:31:48  
Emily  
And would there be anything else that might be missing here of what you would need.

264  
0:32:02  
P13  
Yeah,

265  
0:32:12  
P13  
It doesn't say

266  
0:32:15  
P13  
If you're on a payment plan or not. That's 1 of the things I did was was applied to the the

267  
0:32:25  
P13  
the financial office for payments to make payments.

268  
0:32:29  
Emily  
Okay.

269  
0:32:30  
P13  
Because I was getting bills every month, or over a hundred dollars.

270  
0:32:34  
Emily  
Hmm, okay.

271  
0:32:35  
P13  
And for somebody who's on social security. That's that's quite a bit.

272  
0:32:40  
Emily  
Hmm, okay.

273  
0:32:41  
P13  
So yeah, if there was I don't know where.

274  
0:32:48  
P13  
I don't see anything on this page.

275  
0:32:53  
P13  
Okay, wait, says request help. By Nope.

276  
0:33:00  
P13  
yeah, there's nothing on this page, really. That shows me how to.

277  
0:33:09  
P13  
unless I, we have maybe a Pdf statement.

278  
0:33:16  
P13  
Okay.

279  
0:33:17  
Emily  
What, what, specifically, would you would you be looking for here.

280  
0:33:23  
P13  
How do I, or am I eligible to apply for payments.

281  
0:33:28  
Emily  
Okay.

282  
0:33:29  
P13  
A payment, an installment payment plan.

283  
0:33:31  
Emily  
Okay, all right. So so do you. You'd want to see some sort of indication of that here.

284  
0:33:36  
P13  
Yeah. Something to at least let me know that that option is available.

285  
0:33:42  
P13  
And how I would go about applying for it.

286  
0:33:45  
Emily  
Okay. So you don't want to know right here that you might be able to apply for a payment plan.

287  
0:33:51  
P13  
Right.

288  
0:33:51  
Emily  
Okay, got it.

289  
0:33:53  
Emily  
And then jumping briefly to another topic. If you were looking for older statements, where would you would you assume you might find them here.

290  
0:34:08  
Emily  
or where. Where would you seem to find them? I should say.

291  
0:34:10  
P13  
Hmm!

292  
0:34:23  
P13  
No, I don't see where I could go find a previous statement. It shows a previous unpaid balance.

293  
0:34:31  
Emily  
Okay.

294  
0:34:31  
P13  
But I don't see any place where it'll take me to previous statements.

295  
0:34:35  
Emily  
Okay. Good. What what might you be looking for if you were looking for those.

296  
0:34:41  
P13  
Well, for example, I had mentioned before, about if a copayment had changed from one month to the next, the amount though I would have to have that previous.

297  
0:34:53  
P13  
Well, certainly the Va. Knowing the Va. They love their paperwork, so I would have to have some hard copy hard letter paperwork showing

298  
0:35:05  
P13  
what it was one month, and what it was the next month, and you know, I would have that in case I need to submit it to the Va.

299  
0:35:13  
Emily  
Got it. Got it? Okay? Have you? And since you mentioned the hard copies, have you printed out any like like, let's say, statements or letters. Either from the website or your phone.

300  
0:35:30  
P13  
I think I think I had. No, I don't believe I ever printed out the statement. I think all of mine came in the mail.

301  
0:35:37  
Emily  
Oh, got it? Okay?

302  
0:35:40  
Emily  
And is that something you have ever done before, really, really could be printing anything from your phone specifically.

303  
0:35:51  
P13  
I I can't say that I have used everything from my phone, as I said I I'm more

304  
0:35:59  
P13  
more drawn to using the laptop. And it's it's a lot easier to print from my laptop. I I don't really think I've ever done it from my phone.

305  
0:36:08  
Emily  
Okay, got it? Got it? Alright. Let me have you tap on payments again on the lower right? I'm gonna get you to a different version, and then scroll down toward the bottom of this, and then in that blank gray area toward the bottom tap that once

306  
0:36:24  
Emily  
there we go and then tap into copays again.

307  
0:36:29  
Emily  
Beautiful. So this is a slightly different version. I want to get your thoughts again. Looking at this top on the James a Haley Veterans Hospital. If you were to see. Well, you can scroll around and just see the information here. But yeah, let me have you tap into the details for that. The Haley Veterans Hospital

308  
0:36:53  
Emily  
Bill. There we go.

309  
0:36:57  
Emily  
and then thoughts on on this. So this this version does not have the payment option that you had seen before opening up pay.gov.

310  
0:37:09  
Emily  
Thoughts on having a version like that that did not have that direct link to pay.gov.

311  
0:37:17  
P13  
Yeah, it's it's something that would discourage me from using it.

312  
0:37:21  
Emily  
Oh, got it. Okay, so would you? Would you think you might use it at all if there is no payment? Or you might.

313  
0:37:30  
P13  
like, I said, for if I was at the Va. Or somewhere away from home, where I didn't have my laptop.

314  
0:37:38  
P13  
excuse me.

315  
0:37:40  
P13  
it might have some information that I could use but but as far as you know how to pay and what options I had. No, I would go back to my laptop.

316  
0:37:53  
Emily  
Okay, got it, got it.

317  
0:37:54  
P13  
And start looking from there.

318  
0:37:55  
Emily  
Okay, got it. And so when you said this might have information that you would need even if it didn't have the payment, what sort of information would would it have? That would be useful.

319  
0:38:06  
P13  
It would, it would be, you know, like to itemize charges. How much would it be in charge? Per Copay per medication?

320  
0:38:15  
P13  
And just to make sure like, said that that none of those have changed or increased from month to month.

321  
0:38:24  
Emily  
Got it all right. Makes sense.

322  
0:38:29  
Emily  
and then thoughts. Since I know you said you have gone on the website, a bunch thoughts on

323  
0:38:37  
Emily  
how? What you're looking at here compares to what you've seen on the website. Obviously, it's a larger screen on the website. But and any other thoughts.

324  
0:38:47  
P13  
It's a lot of it has to do just familiarity. I've been using the Va website for

325  
0:38:55  
P13  
20 years, 15 years somewhere in there, so I'm fairly familiar with how to navigate around it.

326  
0:39:03  
Emily  
Okay.

327  
0:39:03  
P13  
This. This would be a learning experience.

328  
0:39:09  
Emily  
Okay.

329  
0:39:11  
Emily  
and let me have you? Oh, sorry. One question, any other. Thoughts, on how? Any of the sections are labeled, so that it would be clear to you where to go.

330  
0:39:36  
P13  
yeah, maybe down at the bottom where it shows home health benefits payments there might be

331  
0:39:45  
P13  
another button you could use down there.

332  
0:39:51  
P13  
that could show Pdf statements, or whatever.

333  
0:39:56  
Emily  
Oh, okay, you'd want you'd want separate out.

334  
0:39:58  
P13  
Yeah. Instead of having to go through one or 2 or 3 screens to get to the Pdf, just tap on, tap on it right at the bottom, and it takes you right to it.

335  
0:40:09  
Emily  
Oh, got it! And so

336  
0:40:11  
P13  
those Pdf statements could be could then be, you know, set in chronological order, from the most recent to the oldest.

337  
0:40:21  
Emily  
Okay.

338  
0:40:22  
Emily  
and do you think? So I, I know when when we looked at the the sample statement, it was, it was too small to see thoughts on how you might use

339  
0:40:33  
Emily  
all of these statements on the phone if if they were directly linked on the bottom.

340  
0:40:38  
P13  
Well the the statement. When I opened it up. I I tried to enlarge it.

341  
0:40:44  
P13  
you know, you know 2 finger enlarge in.

342  
0:40:48  
Emily  
Life. Yeah, it's it's a.

343  
0:40:50  
P13  
It wasn't working so hopefully that would work on the the actual screen.

344  
0:40:55  
Emily  
Oh, okay, got it. So if if you were able to get it to actually let me have you scroll back up, and I'll show you that it does actually zoom. But with this a different way to do it, just because it's a prototype. So go ahead and tap on the go to current statement

345  
0:41:09  
Emily  
and then tap once in the middle of that, and it'll enlarge. But yeah, so.

346  
0:41:13  
P13  
Oh, yeah.

347  
0:41:14  
Emily  
That that's only a prototype thing.

348  
0:41:18  
P13  
All right.

349  
0:41:26  
Emily  
So then, knowing that you could you? You could, in fact, zoom in like you were attempting to do before.

350  
0:41:33  
Emily  
Do you think you still might use these Pdf statements from the phone.

351  
0:41:38  
P13  
Yeah. Yeah. Now that I could read.

352  
0:41:40  
Emily  
Yeah, alright got it. And and again, so this you're using statements? Purely to to check check things to make sure that the pricing didn't change things like that. Is that right?

353  
0:41:54  
P13  
Make some depressing and change. Make sure my previous payments had had been

354  
0:42:02  
P13  
accounted for

355  
0:42:04  
P13  
And whatever Copays make sure that I actually did receive those medications, things of that.

356  
0:42:11  
Emily  
Okay, got it here. Double checking. Everything sounds good and do you ever save any digital statements like these? It doesn't have to be with Va. It could be any anything else you have.

357  
0:42:20  
P13  
No man.

358  
0:42:22  
Emily  
Okay. Got it all right. Tap on. Done there in the upper left.

359  
0:42:27  
Emily  
Okay, and I'm gonna we only have a few minutes left, but I might quickly have you go to again payments on the lower right

360  
0:42:37  
Emily  
and then tap on overpayment debts

361  
0:42:42  
Emily  
all right. And so again, we're going to in this pretend scenario. There are a few debts, thoughts on the information presented here, how useful or not useful it might be in regards to overpayment debts that you have in this pretend scenario.

362  
0:43:02  
P13  
Like, see the disability, compensation and pension debt.

363  
0:43:08  
P13  
And so

364  
0:43:13  
P13  
I would hit review details. But that doesn't seem to be doing anything.

365  
0:43:17  
Emily  
If you scroll to the top. Yeah, only one of these are active. Only if you scroll to the top and that top one, the post 9, 11 Gi. Bill for housing that one. The details will work.

366  
0:43:30  
Emily  
There we go. Yeah. So thoughts on the details that are shared here in terms of what would be important.

367  
0:43:34  
P13  
Yeah, alright. Well, it is showing that the payment was received and applied.

368  
0:43:46  
P13  
Debt letter history. That's something I haven't seen before.

369  
0:43:50  
Emily  
Oh, okay.

370  
0:43:53  
P13  
Yeah, yeah, this looks good.

371  
0:43:55  
Emily  
Okay, you said the the debt letter. History is not something you've seen before. Looking at it. Now, how thoughts on what you're looking at.

372  
0:44:07  
P13  
Well, it's just it's showing the chronological timeline of, you know. I guess you could say 1st contact 1st demand

373  
0:44:19  
P13  
So I imagine that the VA has all these timelines or time deadlines

374  
0:44:28  
P13  
so I would want to know: was I approaching any kind of a time deadline.

375  
0:44:34  
Emily  
Got it. Okay?

376  
0:44:37  
Emily  
Alright. And would you?

377  
0:44:39  
Emily  
So you'd be looking for just just the the dates? Or would there be other information you'd want to know. Under this debt letter, history.

378  
0:44:47  
P13  
Yeah, I'd like to make sure.

379  
0:44:52  
P13  
you know what these letters were actually saying.

380  
0:44:55  
Emily  
Oh, okay.

381  
0:44:56  
P13  
But but I'm guessing if if it's on here

382  
0:45:00  
P13  
that, I have probably received a hard copy of it in the mail.

383  
0:45:04  
Emily  
Okay, and would you?

384  
0:45:10  
Emily  
what what would be your next steps? It says they said you you assume you would probably have already received a hard copy.

385  
0:45:20  
P13  
I wouldn't pay much attention to it unless there was something in the hard copy that said, You know, you need to pay attention to this, and take care of

386  
0:45:29  
P13  
whatever.

387  
0:45:31  
Emily  
Okay, got it? Got it? Alright. Let me excuse me. Let me scroll to the top of this one again. And then excuse me? Any other information up here? Like. What? What would you be looking for? What details would you want to know?

388  
0:45:55  
P13  
Well, probably where it says, why might I have this debt? You know I would want to know when the debt was incurred.

389  
0:46:03  
Emily  
Okay.

390  
0:46:05  
P13  
It shows me a payment due date, but it doesn't

391  
0:46:08  
P13  
tell me anything about. When the debt was incurred.

392  
0:46:10  
Emily  
Okay? And so, yeah, you can go ahead and tap on that since you mentioned that. And.

393  
0:46:23  
P13  
Okay.

394  
0:46:25  
Emily  
Thoughts on that information.

395  
0:46:29  
P13  
Yeah, that didn't really tell me

396  
0:46:34  
P13  
as far as when the debt was incurred. It just says some reasons why I might be charged for the debt.

397  
0:46:41  
Emily  
Okay.

398  
0:46:42  
P13  
So that yeah, that's lacking information. I would like to have.

399  
0:46:46  
Emily  
Got it. Okay? And where else might you look for that information such like like, when you incurred the debt.

400  
0:47:04  
P13  
I I don't know. I couldn't tell you that, looking at this page.

401  
0:47:08  
Emily  
Okay.

402  
0:47:10  
Emily  
got it. Okay? So you'd want to know more information on when you incurred the debt anything else that you will be looking for here.

403  
0:47:20  
P13  
Maybe the that copy button. Next to the account number.

404  
0:47:25  
Emily  
Oh, okay, yep.

405  
0:47:30  
Emily  
Got it. Let me have you? Since you brought that, let me get you to a different section again. Tap the the payments button at the bottom

406  
0:47:39  
Emily  
alright, and then again scroll to the bottom and

407  
0:47:43  
Emily  
yeah, tap in the the blank gray area.

408  
0:47:47  
Emily  
There we go. Thank you. Tap into overpayment debts

409  
0:47:51  
Emily  
and then under review details again.

410  
0:47:59  
Emily  
Okay, so let's say, since you mentioned the copying of the account number if you did. If you were were ready to make a payment here, what would be the steps you would take.

411  
0:48:11  
P13  
I think I go to resolve debt first.st

412  
0:48:13  
Emily  
Okay.

413  
0:48:16  
P13  
And then it says, Pay online other ways to pay. So I probably says, Pay online. But it doesn't really say, Go to pay.gov. So that's a little confusing.

414  
0:48:28  
P13  
Oh, okay. So if that, if hitting that button takes you to pay.gov or not.

415  
0:48:34  
Emily  
Oh, got it. Okay. So is that something you would want to know from here.

416  
0:48:37  
P13  
Yes, absolutely.

417  
0:48:38  
Emily  
Okay. Good.

418  
0:48:38  
P13  
Because otherwise I don't know whether to hit pay online or other ways to pay.

419  
0:48:43  
Emily  
Okay. So it's it's not clear just where it might be sending you.

420  
0:48:47  
P13  
Correct.

421  
0:48:48  
Emily  
Okay, got it? Alright. Let me have you close that one other question.

422  
0:48:52  
Emily  
Okay, and then a similar question is, when we're talking to Copays. If let's say you were looking to see if you could do a payment plan. What? What would be your next steps to exploring that option.

423  
0:49:10  
P13  
I'd probably go to request help.

424  
0:49:12  
Emily  
Okay.

425  
0:49:16  
P13  
There we go!

426  
0:49:17  
Emily  
Okay.

427  
0:49:19  
P13  
Request Payment Plan.

428  
0:49:21  
Emily  
Alright and thoughts on how easy or difficult that that would be to find if you were looking for that information.

429  
0:49:30  
P13  
That one. This one's easier than than the previous one.

430  
0:49:34  
Emily  
Got it. Okay.

431  
0:49:38  
P13  
Okay.

432  
0:49:40  
P13  
And it also shows debt relief.

433  
0:49:44  
P13  
if you wanted to request a waiver or compromise offer. So yeah, I don't. I don't think I saw that earlier.

434  
0:49:51  
Emily  
Got it. Okay? So it's it's a little more clear in this this version. Here.

435  
0:49:56  
P13  
Yes, ma'am.

436  
0:49:57  
Emily  
Okay, great. I'll have you close that

437  
0:50:01  
Emily  
and let me have you tap on the. So go sorry. Go back to resolve that and do pay online. We're just gonna look at

438  
0:50:10  
Emily  
One thing.

439  
0:50:13  
P13  
Okay. Now it shows me the pay on pay.gov.

440  
0:50:21  
P13  
Yeah, but I would rather have that on the previous screen.

441  
0:50:25  
Emily  
Okay, you want to know exactly where you are. You are going there and then.

442  
0:50:32  
Emily  
yeah. Thoughts on on the information that's that is presented here. First.st

443  
0:50:40  
P13  
yeah. Well, there's something in there. I'm not sure. Why, I would need to like for deduction code.

444  
0:50:48  
P13  
it's sounds like something that Va needs intern internally, not something I would need to know.

445  
0:50:54  
Emily  
Okay, what would make it more clear? As to why this information is here.

446  
0:51:01  
P13  
Well, yeah, I can understand the current balance file number pay number and person entitled those kind of are self explanatory to me the deduction code. Why, that's on there, or why, that's important. I that's confusing.

447  
0:51:18  
Emily  
Okay, got it? Let me have you tap on the pay on pay.gov.

448  
0:51:25  
Emily  
and then go to leave.

449  
0:51:36  
Emily  
Okay. So I know it's really tiny. I'm not. Gonna have you read this, but there's a very where it says, Pay online toward the top. It's underlined. Go ahead and tap that.

450  
0:51:47  
Emily  
Yeah, and then scroll down a bit.

451  
0:51:53  
Emily  
Keep going. It's like, it's like, halfway down the page or so. Okay, so right here, yeah, right there actually scroll up just a little bit.

452  
0:52:02  
Emily  
Thought so. If you were ready to make a payment and had to enter in thoughts on what you might do from here. And again. I'm not going to have you type in anything.

453  
0:52:25  
P13  
I don't know.

454  
0:52:28  
P13  
This is like information overload at this point.

455  
0:52:31  
Emily  
Go. Okay, got information overload. Okay? Not a problem. Alright. Well, we are right at time. We got through exactly what I wanted to get through. So thank you. I'm just gonna check in with my colleagues if they have anything to ask. Michelle and Natasha, if you have any questions, feel free to unmute and ask them.

456  
0:52:53  
Michelle  
I have one question. I'm curious you mentioned use the web a lot for managing healthcare right? Like prescriptions and things like that. I'm curious about your the time that you spent with Emily

457  
0:53:06  
Michelle  
app using a prototype of the app. Does that make you interested in using your app at all for healthcare?

458  
0:53:13  
P13  
It, it.

459  
0:53:13  
Michelle  
The interest in doing that.

460  
0:53:14  
P13  
Oh, again, it would be only in certain situations if the laptop wasn't available.

461  
0:53:24  
Michelle  
Okay.

462  
0:53:25  
P13  
It's easier for me because I I do have reading glasses. It's hard for me to read

463  
0:53:34  
P13  
my phone without my glasses, and even with the glasses. Some of these pages have extremely small

464  
0:53:42  
P13  
printing on them, so my 1st choice would always be the laptop if it was available.

465  
0:53:49  
P13  
but I would like to have this as a backup.

466  
0:53:53  
Michelle  
Okay, fair enough. Yeah, thank you so much for all your input. Thank you.

467  
0:53:57  
P13  
Nice, alright!

468  
0:54:00  
Emily  
Alright. Well, that is

469  
0:54:02  
Emily  
all we have really appreciate your time. It's always super helpful for us to speak directly with veterans about your experiences, and to see thoughts on what we are considering building. So I know Paragene is going to be reaching out to you for next steps, as a thank you for participating, and that is all for us, and I really hope you have a great rest of your day.

470  
0:54:26  
P13  
Alright. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.

471  
0:54:28  
Emily  
Thanks! Take care!

472  
0:54:30  
P13  
But.
