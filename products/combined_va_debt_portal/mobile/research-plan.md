	# Research Plan for Mobile Feature Support Including Military History, Debt Services, April 2025

## Research Goals ðŸ¥…	

### Goals

`1.` **Understand the situations, behaviors, and triggers involved in managing VA debt.**

`2.` **Understand Veteransâ€™ needs for managing their debt.**

`3.` **Determine best organization for debt management.** 

`4.` **Understand Veteransâ€™ needs for requesting help with debt.**
  
### Outcomes

Validate whether the following mobile app features will be valuable and usable for Veterans.
* A Debt Portal displaying both VHA and VBA debt details and statements
* The ability to make payments toward both VHA and VBA debts
* A form for disputing debts
* Access to all available debt letters

Assess user interest in the inclusion of:
* Financial Status Report: full report
* Financial Status Report: streamlined
* One VA Debt Letter

Determine how to organize different types of debt: keep them separate (as VBA and VHA currently are on the web), or introduce a combined portal which shows all types together (including any future types of debt added).
