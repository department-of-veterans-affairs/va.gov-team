Start recording.



* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?  Sure
* Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you? That’s fine

**Discussion**

Could you tell me a bit about yourself as a Veteran: what branch of the military did you serve, and when did you retire or separate? I was in the [redacted] from 73 to 77. 

How have you been involved with the VA – both in the past and now?  I think it started in 96 or so I had [redacted] and went into the va and they put in a plate and serval screws, I have been using them since. They are still in there so. 



* Have you been in any of their facilities? 
* Have you used the website and/or app? For what purpose(s)? Website; I use  to check and order medication and check on medication. I rarely use the app. The app was used the first time; I am normally on my laptop. I used the app once to make sure it worked. 
* Thoughts on if you would use it or what’s preventing you: its more convenient and the screen is larger on the laptop than the mobile. 

Now we're going to move to the financial portion of our discussion. I want to make sure that you’re only sharing what you’re willing – I have no additional information about you or your finances with the VA.

**Cohort 2 - Copays ✂️ ✂️ ✂️ ✂️**



* *Overview of their financial obligations*
    * (copays) What is your experience with medical copayments through the VA? Yes once they took the payments for pension I was taken out for no pension it took me out of group 3 and now I have copays. Then I had to submit a waiver and had to pay copays for a year.
        * Do you receive any of these bills? If so, how? They would sent me something through the mail and the internet. I believe they told me it was an amount and an itemized amount and the list of medication and I paid on pay.gov. I did that for a while, then when I got the new pension I didn’t have to do the copays anymore. 
        * How long have you been receiving them?
        * How often do you receive them?
    * (VBA debts) Have you had any debts as a result of a benefit overpayment? This was about 2 years ago I was getting a pension and what they didn’t tell me was I was approved for SSI and a va pension within months of each other. I can remember which one was first. I was 58 when I got SSI, at 65 the disability changes to retire which then makes the va pension income, at that point then there’s 2 years of va income that is considered overpayments so $ [redacted] of overpayments. This whole process was online, I submitted a wavier and the situation and they ended up waiver the entire amount. It blew me away but thank God
        * What was the situation?
        * When and how were you notified of the debt? They sent me a letter
        * Easier: if they had let me know at 65 my status was changing I could have made arrangements but not knowing and then 2 years coming back to collect overpayments is hard. 
        * Th0oughts at first: I used VA and google to find out the options. They mentioned something in the letter that I could apply for a waiver. After 6 months I got the letter saying they waived it. 
        * Had you known about the waiver before the letter: No
        * How long did it take you to pay it off? Or do you have a rough idea when you’ll pay it off?

 \




* *Notifications/awareness*
    * (copays) Tell me how you learn that you have a bill.
        * Tell me what prompts you to make a payment: Something at the end of the month I added it to what needed to be taken care of on the list. They were on the list to do. 
        * Bille ach month: Yes
        * Letter: Yes
        * What is your thought on how the bills are presented to you?
        * How are you paying the bills? (mobile/web, how often, payment method) Pay.gov
        * Is there anything that could make things easier for you?
    * *(if relevant)* (VBA debts) Tell me how you know you need to make a payment.
        * Tell me what prompts you to make a payment
        * What is your thought on the communication regarding what needs to be paid?
        * How are you paying the debts? (payment method, benefit reduction, how often, mobile/web)
        * Is there anything that could make things easier for you?

 \




* *(if they have both)*
    * Consider both the copayment bills and the overpayment debts: in your mind, do these feel like different types of financial issues to you? Or do they belong in the same category? They both came from the same sort with were the pension overpayment and the pension payment. 

**Prototype & Usability**

I'm going to be showing you a prototype of the mobile app, with some new features that we're testing out before we consider building them.

*(request they share screen)*

Please open up the Figma app, and I’ll be walking you through how to sign in.



* *(share test credentials with them)*
* *(after logging in, send them [prototype link](https://www.figma.com/proto/kRA7JHbthNrSLxTQHrzH8T/MFS---Overpayments---Copays-%7C-VA-Mobile?page-id=2001%3A429&node-id=7274-61308&p=f&viewport=24600%2C-1348%2C0.59&t=RzEWQo0ZfxtjJRxF-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=7274%3A61308&show-proto-sidebar=1) over Zoom chat)*

From home screen



* You're on the home screen of our pretend mobile app.
* Don’t yet click on anything: show me where to find what money you currently owe: I believe it is called va.gov then myva is normally how I get to it. I guess where it says latest payment. Possibly claims or messages. 
    * How clear was that to find?
    * Tell me your thoughts on the title of that section.
        * What would you expect to find there?
        * Are there other names that would be a better description or make things easier to find?
* Now click into that tab
    * What are your thoughts on the info presented here? It shows overpayments and copays. This is pretty much everything on the payments and where they are being depositing and what I owe. 
    * Does this make sense: yes absolutely. 
    * Payments owed and coming to you: I could see how that might be confusing at times if you aren’t thinking to clearly. From what I see it is separated clearly
    * Anything to make it clearer: Maybe color code it so maybe one green and one red. 
    * Now that you see what’s in this section: any further thoughts on the name “payments”?
    * Regarding the info below the word "copay" – what would be the most helpful to see there? I would want something like the va they sent me for copayments do that itemized the medication for each on was. I would like to do know how to make the payments, if they have to be online/mail them, does it mention anything about pay.gov. 

Copayments

*(with payment option)* 



* Find what you currently owe for copayments
    * How clear was that to find? I looks like it shows three bills with them having a balance. 
    * What can you tell me about the other copayments on this screen? The amount, when its due, and ow to make the payment. 
    * Under details, do you need to know more: It looks comprehensive, there’s a pdf statement which would be the itemized charges. It looks pretty comprehensive. 
    * Statement use: If I didn’t get a medication or the medication amount of the copay changed form one month to the next I would like to know.
    * You might look at on the phone: I don’t know if I would continue using the phone, I would rather use the laptop to do use because it is easier to see the screen. The phone is a small screen to see all of this. 
    * Anything else with the statement: No 
* After you have a medical appointment, when would you expect to see the copayment appear here? 
    * How would you expect to be notified?
* What do you need to know for each copay due?
    * How easy/difficult is it to find relevant information?
* Are you usually visiting different VA locations for your healthcare?
    * How clearly is everything presented here? (do they know the copays from locations are grouped?)
* *[point to a specific copay]* What can you tell me about your activity here?
    * Is it clear when the payment is due?
* If you pay off a copay, would you want to see it?
    * Here or anywhere else?
    * Are there any here that you believe are paid off? How clear is it?
* Let’s pretend you see an error – *[point to a specific copay]* one of the copays is for an appointment that you did not have. What would you do? I noticed the number for the business on the bill, I think it was where it said pay bill. I know I read something about it. Maybe back to payments. US department of Treasury Debt at 888 is the number I would call
* Next steps: I would hope it was on the first page when I say the bill. I would hope the number was right there when I was looking at the bill. 
* Click on the help button, thoughts: Yeah this should be bigger. The help button is a bit small. I don’t know if you could but thing else other than the number for the debt services on the other page. 
* Open that: dispute copay debt, sure. 
    * What sort of info or guidance might you look for?
* Now we’re going to pretend that you don’t believe you’re going to have the money to pay the most recent copay bills. Walk me through what you would do in this situation.: I would go to pay.gov because that’s what I normally did. The way I did it the first time there was a link on the pay.gov webpage if I filled it out before they could fill it out for me. 
* What if you did it for the first time: I would need the account number which is on the bill and I would need to enter the parts separately. Copying it from here would be helpful but I kinda stick with what I know and I typically have the paper bill. If I got use to this I wouldn’t need the paper bill anymore. 
    * What sort of info or guidance might you look for?
    * Is it clear when you would have to start something?
    * What are your thoughts on opening new windows for the information?
* Were you aware of these options for financial help? If so, how did you learn?
* What else would you want to do here with regards to your copays?
    * How would you expect to make payments?
    * What are your thoughts on this new section not having a payment option?
    * If this were to be built in real life, how likely would you be to use it? Extremely. Like I said it has the limitation of a small screen. Unless I was at the va this is information I want available
    * Anything missing that you need: It doesn’t say if you are on a payment plan or not. I applied on a payment plan or not. I was getting bills over 100 each month and for someone on SSI that’s a lot for each month. Theres nothing on this page that shows me how to, unless maybe it is on the PDF statement. 
    * What would you be looking for here: If I ama available to apply for an installment plan. I would want to know if that option is available and how to apply for it. 
    * Older statements: I don’t see where I would see previous statements I see previously paid balances. 
    * What would you look for. Like I said if one copayment changed form one month to the next. I would need to see it, I would need to see the hard copy what is was one month to the next, I would have that incase I need to submit it.
    * Have you printed anything from the website or phone: I don’t think I have printed on, I think they have come in the mail
    * Have you ever had to print form your phone: I can’t say I have. I am more drawn to using the laptop and it is easier. I don’t think I have done it from the phone. 

*(no payment option)* 



* Now I'm going to have you [open another prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/kRA7JHbthNrSLxTQHrzH8T/MFS---Overpayments---Copays-%7C-VA-Mobile?page-id=2001%3A429&node-id=7372-28070&p=f&viewport=24600%2C-1348%2C0.59&t=RzEWQo0ZfxtjJRxF-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=7372%3A28070&show-proto-sidebar=1) to view a different version. *(with payment option)*
    * I would be discouraged from using is since I cant make a payment. I was at the VA or way from home with my laptop and needed something I might but if I had my laptop I would use that. 
    * What would you use it for: The itemized charges and copays for medications. To make sure none of those have changed or increased from month to month. 
    * Thoughts on here to the website: a lot of it has to do with familiarity. I have used the site for 15-20 years so I am familiar with navigation. This would be a learning experience. 
    * Labeled sections: Um. Maybe at the bottom where it says home, health, benefits, payments, maybe another button that could show PDF statements. Instead of having to go through multiple screens just tap on it at the bottom to go right to it. Those could just be in Chronological order from newest to oldest. 
    * How would you use the statements if directly links: The statement when I opened I tried to enlarge it. It wasn’t working but hopefully it would work. Now that I can read it I would use it. I would make sure the prices didn’t change and make sure everything was accounted for. I would make sure I received the medications. 
    * Do you save digital statements: No. 

Overpayments: time-dependent and if relevant

Thoughts on information here: I see the compensation and pension debt; I would click review details but its not doing anything. 

Thoughts on details, what’s important: it shows the payment was made and applied. It shows the debt letter history which I hadn’t seen before. This looks good. 

Debt letter history, thoughts: It’s just the chronological timeline for contact. I imagine that they have a timeline and deadlines so I would want to know if I was approaching a deadline. 

What would you want to know: I would want to make sure what the letters were actually saying. If it is actually on here I probably got a hard copy in the mail. 

Next steps: I wouldn’t pay much attention unless something in the hard copy said there was something I needed to pay attention to.  

What wouldn’t you look for up here: I would look at why might I have this debt, I would want to know when it was incurred. It tells me when it is due but not when it was incurred. 

Thoughts on that: it didn’t tell me anything, it told me reasons as to why I might have been charged for debt. It lacked information

Where else might you look: I don’t know.

Then how would I pay this there’s not account number, I would put it down there

How would you pay: I would go to resolve debt. It says pay online but not pay on pay.gov so that’s confusing. I don’t know to click pay online or other ways to pay. 

Payment plan: I would go to request help. There we go, request payment plan. 

Thoughts on how hard/easy that is: That one was easier than the previous one. It also shows debt relief if you want to request a waiver or comprised offer. 

Resolve debt and click pay online: Now it shows me pay on pay.gov, I would rather have that on the previous screen. 

Thoughts on this information: Yeah there’s something in there, I don’t know why I need the deduction code, I don’t know why I need that it seems that’s something the va needs

Why might you need it: I know the other ones they are self-explanatory. Deduction code is confusing. 

Pay.gov, what might you do from here: I don’t know. 

Those are all my questions. I’m going to check in with my team to see if anyone has any questions. If anyone would like to ask anything, you can unmute yourself and ask now.

Is there anything else you would like to share regarding managing finances that you haven’t yet shared?

**Consent to use video clips**



* I want to check once again that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners with your identifying information removed.
* Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?

**Thank-You and Closing**

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the digital experience and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
