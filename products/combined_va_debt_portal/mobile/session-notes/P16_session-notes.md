Start recording.



* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? That‚Äôs fine.
* Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you? That‚Äôs fine. 

**Discussion**

Could you tell me a bit about yourself as a Veteran: what branch of the military did you serve, and when did you retire or separate? I was in the [redacted] from 2011 to 2020. I joined in the reserves so I am a reservist now. 

How have you been involved with the VA ‚Äì both in the past and now? Um. Like in terms of what. I do have healthcare, I use them. I don‚Äôt have insurance with my company since I have VA. I have in in [redacted]. 



* Have you been in any of their facilities? 
* Have you used the website and/or app? For what purpose(s)?  I think it hard to navigate it especially if I am looking for things and a lot of times in terms of payment I would have to call to make a payment or submit a form instead of paying online. It is not modern. 
* Website or app: the website. 
* Have you used the app: no. 
* Downloaded: I wasn‚Äôt aware that there was a mobile app. 

Now we're going to move to the financial portion of our discussion. I want to make sure that you‚Äôre only sharing what you‚Äôre willing ‚Äì I have no additional information about you or your finances with the VA.

**Cohort 1 - Overpayments ‚úÇÔ∏è ‚úÇÔ∏è ‚úÇÔ∏è ‚úÇÔ∏è**



* *Overview of their financial obligations*
    * (VBA debts) Have you had experience with owing the VA money? If you‚Äôre comfortable, could you tell me about that experience?  Yes I have since I am on the reserve I go on active-duty orders and it basically they wont know until the reserves send that information so I have to pay them back what they paid me when I was on orders. 
        * What was the situation?
        * When and how were you notified of the debt? It is usually by mail. 
        * 
        * How long did it take you to pay it off? Or do you have a rough idea when you‚Äôll pay it off? 
    * (copays) Do you have any experience with medical copayments through the VA? Yes, they have the same process and I use them and paid by phone and online. It is also the form. 
        * Do you receive any of these bills? If so, how? Letter, no email. 
        * Pay when you get the letter: Yes
        * How long have you been receiving them?
        * How often do you receive them?

 \




* *Notifications/awareness*
    * (VBA debts) Tell me how you know you need to make a payment.
        * Tell me what prompts you to make a payment: So when I get a letter they give me a due date to pay it back. 
        * What is your thought on the communication regarding what needs to be paid? It states that I was on orders on these dates and it tells me since I am on orders I am not entitled to orders and I need to pay them back for those benefits during that time. 
        * Options for how you can pay it back: pay via a phone call or online. 
        * Done both: Yes. 
        * Thoughts on experience: the phone call takes awhile because of being on hold sometimes an hour to talk to someone, online it is like a PDF form. It is not an actual payment. I have to submit the form then they use the form to pay. It isn‚Äôt a direct payment. 
        * Submit it to VA: yes
        * How are you paying the debts? (payment method, benefit reduction, how often, mobile/web)
        * Is there anything that could make things easier for you? I think they could redesign the website or I could be informed by email instead of mail. Sometimes I get the mail months later. 
        * Mail , no other notification: unless I check va no. If I check the va site its only mail.
    * *(if relevant)*¬†(copays) Tell me how you learn that you have a bill.
        * Tell me what prompts you to make a payment
        * What is your thought on how the bills are presented to you?
        * How are you paying the bills? (mobile/web, how often, payment method)
        * Is there anything that could make things easier for you?

 \




* *(if they have both)*
    * Consider both the copayment bills and the overpayment debts: in your mind, do these feel like different types of financial issues to you? Or do they belong in the same category? I think it would be the same. Actually no because when I have to pay my benefits I tell them to duct it form my future benefits, for my copays I actually have to pay it. 
    * You can have it deducted for benefits: yes, I can have them take it all from the next month or have it taken out in chunks. I just tell them to take it all. 
    * How do you communicate it: there‚Äôs an option but it‚Äôs easier when I just call and let them know and they do it for me. The form doesn‚Äôt have that option so for the benefits I just call them. 
    * No other option right now: no but for copay I can pay online with the form. 

**Prototype & Usability**

I'm going to be showing you a prototype of the mobile app, with some new features that we're testing out before we consider building them.

*(request they share screen)*

Please open up the Figma app, and I‚Äôll be walking you through how to sign in.



* *(share test credentials with them)*
* *(after logging in, send them¬†[prototype link](https://www.figma.com/proto/kRA7JHbthNrSLxTQHrzH8T/MFS---Overpayments---Copays-%7C-VA-Mobile?page-id=2001%3A429&node-id=7274-61308&p=f&viewport=24600%2C-1348%2C0.59&t=RzEWQo0ZfxtjJRxF-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=7274%3A61308&show-proto-sidebar=1)¬†over Zoom chat)*

From home screen



* You're on the home screen of our pretend mobile app.
* Don‚Äôt yet click on anything: show me where to find what money you currently owe: Claims. Probably the messages. 
    * How clear was that to find? If I am due to pay something there should be something in red that says I am due for payment. Payments for me is when I have to pay something so if I am due to pay something it might have a red bubble and that would prompt me to go into that icon. 
    * Tell me your thoughts on the title of that section.
        * What would you expect to find there?
        * Are there other names that would be a better description or make things easier to find?
* Now click into that tab
    * What are your thoughts on the info presented here? I actually do like this; it shows the history and fi I have anything due in one screen. 
    * Now that you see what‚Äôs in this section: any further thoughts on the name ‚Äúpayments‚Äù? Maybe, I think payments is fine. I was looking for debt or bills. Yeah or payments or debts or something like that. 
    * Regarding the info below the word "overpayments" ‚Äì what would be the most helpful to see there?  What I would look for high level is what I owed, is it medical, for school, home loan or something like that. I would want to know what the debt exactly is. 

Overpayment benefits debt

*(no payment option)*¬†‚ùå üíµ ‚ùå



* Find what you currently owe for overpayment debts: If I click on this does it tell me the due date I am supposed to pay it.
* What would you want: when I need to pay it and how will I pay it. I like that it tells me when the first and second letters were sent. I think they already do this. 
* Letters: sometimes I miss it but they tell me it was sent months ago so I just ignore it. I am not sure where to pay it from this page. Is this just informational. 
* Where would you think you would pay: I would think it would be on the same page or the first screen. If I click review I would like a link to pay or a phone number to pay.
    * How clear was that to find? 
    * What can you tell me about the other debts on this screen?
* If a new debt arises, how would you expect to be notified?
* What do you need to know for each debt?
    * How easy/difficult is it to find relevant information?
* [point to a specific debt] What can you tell me about your activity here?
    * Is it clear when a payment is due?
    * Tell me about the Debt Letter section ‚Äì what do you assume this is and how useful is it?
* If you pay off a debt, would you want to see it?
    * Here or anywhere else?
* Now we‚Äôre going to pretend that you don‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre going to have the money to make a payment on the debt in the next few months. Walk me through what you would do in this situation.
    * What sort of info or guidance might you look for?
    * Is it clear when you would need to start anything?
    * What are your thoughts on opening new windows for the information?
* Were you aware of these options for financial help? If so, how did you learn? Yes. I never used it but I knew it was available. 
* IN the letters : I saw it online it was listed when paying on va.gov. 
* What else would you want to do here with regards to your debt?
    * How would you expect to make payments?
    * What are your thoughts on this new section not having a payment option?
    * If this were to be built in real life, how likely would you be to use it? Since I have my phone it is good to have it but it would be a hassle since I would need to go to the site and the website isn‚Äôt phone friendly, the interface so I would need a PC. 
    * Haven‚Äôt seen the letter: there typ0ically isn‚Äôt a fee they just send the letters so they just keep sending letter. Here it says I can request help but no information on how.
    * Where would you want that: an icon, oh there‚Äôs on right there. I just didn‚Äôt notice that
    * How to make it clear: Maybe just on here like a help link below the information. 
    * Read letters: yes I can read the letters when I am on va.gov
    * Anything else you would want to do: Nothing that I can think of. 
    * Thoughts on other debts: I am not sure why the books and supplies since they are an overpayment. Oh I paid it because it was an overpayment on them. 
    * Could something be more clear: I think it is fine but maybe a month it would go away. 
    * Where would you want to see previous debts that were resolved: under history. If it was on here I would feel like I owe something. These would be active. For July it would be fine but August it should be moved. 

*(with payment option)*¬†‚úÖ üíµ ‚úÖ



* Now I'm going to have you¬†[open another prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/kRA7JHbthNrSLxTQHrzH8T/MFS---Overpayments---Copays-%7C-VA-Mobile?page-id=2001%3A429&node-id=7372-28070&p=f&viewport=24600%2C-1348%2C0.59&t=RzEWQo0ZfxtjJRxF-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=7372%3A28070&show-proto-sidebar=1)¬†to view a different version.

What if you cant pay: Click resolve debt and click request help. Then I would call here or request debt relief. 

When would you call opposed to following request debt relief: I think for me it is easier for me to fill out a form so I would go with debt relief. 

Forms, on phone or laptop: laptop

Why: Usually the phone for me to talk to someone and it is just faster for me to fill out the form.

Anytime you would fill it out on your phone: if the interface is easy I could. 

What would make it easy: Better layout. 



    * If you are ready to make a payment on this debt, walk me through how you would do that: Go to resolve and pay online. Then click the link. 

        Have you seen this before: Yes. 


        Finding information to enter: So usually I have trouble finding the payee number so I have to go to my VA account to look for it. 


        Using account and letters: Yes. 


        Thoughts on this information: I do like it. However I think it would be easier if I could just use this app to pay. 


        What would be your process if you couldn‚Äôt: I would just go to the link and I guess have this open and the link at the say time so I can copy the information and take it over. 

    * Talk to me about that experience of starting to make the payment (e.g. opening .gov, new sign-in, copying payment + account info): If it could automatically generate for the fields that would be good. it isn‚Äôt asking me to sign in. 
    * After you‚Äôve made a payment, what would you expect to see? When would you expect to see an update?
    * If this were to be built in real life, how likely would you be to use it?  I think it is more so just informational and it is easier access but I would use my desktop to make it easier. 
    * Not use the payment section: Yeah it‚Äôs just to see. 
    * How would the likelihood of you using this compare to the previous version where you were not able to make payments? I prefer the second version with  the payment section. It still gives the option to pay on my phone even though I am likely not going to use it. 
* Now that we‚Äôve gone through this section, do you have any other thoughts about what is here and how the information is presented? Maybe the original debt amount because I see a partial on here. I would want to know how much was owed. 
* Where would you see that: it could be on this main icon but at the bottom. The current square but at the bottom. 
* Anything else that might be helpful: No that‚Äôs it. 
* What are your thoughts on how the sections and pages are labeled?
    * Are there other titles that would make more sense to you?
* *(if relevant)*¬†Can you tell me what you think of this experience vs what you have found on va.gov? I like that there‚Äôs a mobile option. I just have my phone all the time and if once I have a debt it will give me that red bubble on the icon in the app so I know to look in the app instead of waiting in the app. 
* Differences that you like/don‚Äôt like: Nothing that I can think of. 

Copayments: time-dependent and if relevant

What information might you look for, thoughts: It just gives the past 6 months, does it give me the full history. 

Where would you see that: the history if it is already paid. 

You would want to see past bills: yes in the history if they were already paid. I wouldn‚Äôt want them here if they are paid.

What‚Äôs important on this bill: Is that account number mine or the VA‚Äôs. How to pay the bill. What it is for, like medication. Yeah what care it was from. 

What would make it clear: I mean if I have to pay it there should be a way to unless it is like an ID for me. Like VA number or member number. 

What it labeled differently: yeah because it sounds like a bank. 

Anything different you‚Äôd want to know: There are different ones for different dates here. 

Didn‚Äôt expect that: Normally because they go by dates instead of clinics like this, each one is individualized instead of grouped by clinic. 

Anything to make it clear: I think this is okay actually. It looks cleaner and when I go here it actually tells me the dates. 

Anything else you‚Äôd want to know about the dates: if its already paid. 

Statements on this page, useful: yes if I want to see the overall balance or account. I might look at it from time to time but I normally don‚Äôt look at my statements.  It looks like the same letter I get when I owe them something. 

Would you look at this if it were here: if I lost a letter yes. 

What would you do with it: I would verify  that the information was correct. 

Anything else:  If I have to pay I go here to look at my number. 

The number to pay: Yeah

What if you see an error: I would go to the help button and call them. I would click pay and if there‚Äôs no error I would go to pay.gov. 

Information: I have the letter to fill out the account number. 

Do this when you are holding the letter: Yes

Thoughts on this: I do like this. If they can‚Äôt automate it, I think the link is fine. 

How to get the info to pay.gov: copy paste/ 

Anything to make it easier: No they give me all of the options I need. 

Anything else you haven‚Äôt mentioned that you might need: In terms of payment no. 

Thoughts on if you might use this with payments instead of without payment: The on where I can pay would be used more. 

Those are all my questions. I‚Äôm going to check in with my team to see if anyone has any questions. If anyone would like to ask anything, you can unmute yourself and ask now.

Is there anything else you would like to share regarding managing finances that you haven‚Äôt yet shared?

**Consent to use video clips**



* I want to check once again that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners with your identifying information removed.
* Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?

**Thank-You and Closing**

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the digital experience and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again and enjoy the rest of your day!
