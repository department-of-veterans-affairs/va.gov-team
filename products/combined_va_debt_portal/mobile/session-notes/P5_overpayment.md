# Summary from Dovetail

#### App usability and preferences

- The VA app is preferred over the website for most tasks except education benefits, with users appreciating its simplicity and Face ID login functionality. [1]("As much as I can. And a lot of it's just because, it's just, it's. The app's great for anything.")[2]("and then anything deaths. So those two are incorporated. I mean the app would be perfect. You would never have to use the site.")

- The app is viewed as a streamlined "Cliff Notes" version compared to the more complex website experience. [3]("The va, I use the. It's almost like the Cliff Notes is the app. And that's all I want is the Cliff Notes. It's. The website's usually too convoluted compared to the app.")

#### Debt awareness and communication

- Users may discover debts through the app but lack clear notification mechanisms, suggesting a need for proactive alerts about new debts. [4]("I glanced at it on that's how I learned because I was looking up my post 911 GI benefits and then somehow I scrolled over and there was this thing like you have one debt. And I'm like, what is that? So I've never received a letter.")

- Letters remain a primary form of debt communication, though users express interest in having digital access to letters directly within the app. [5]("Well, I think it'd be good if there's. And I don't know, maybe I'm not set up for it on the VA app about notifications")[6]("kind of like an access to the letter. So like if you go into VA disability, like you can basically get all your letters on your iPhone. Generate letters.")

#### Payment experience and opportunities

- Users strongly prefer digital payment options and express frustration with having to leave the app to complete payments. [7]("And anything that keeps you from having to log into a government website. But using a government app with a face ID is a million bucks in my opinion.")

- The complex account number entry process on pay.gov creates friction, with users suggesting simplified payment flows and clearer copying mechanisms. [8]("Put all my information like this is confusing. Part. 1, 2, 3, 4. Mayor's full name, email address, payment amount. It just be nice to have it all right here")[9]("Copy. That'd be perfect. What I would do is just jot it down on a sticky pad, but.")

#### Statement management preferences

- Users value easy access to current and previous statements for reference, particularly for larger payment amounts. [10]("I would use it because I wouldn't want to check out especially when you start getting into hundreds of dollars like. Yeah, definitely need the easy access the statements.")

- Statement organization could be improved by clearly distinguishing between current and previous statements with clear PDF labeling. [11]("So if you have loaded previous statements, parentheses PDF would be nice underneath.")


# Notes by Perigean. Conversation Guide used as the structure for notes.

Start recording.



* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? *Yes
* Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you? *Yes

**Discussion**

Could you tell me a bit about yourself as a Veteran: what branch of the military did you serve, and when did you retire or separate? *US coast guard, separated 2013. I’m a disabled Veteran, I use healthcare, education. 

How have you been involved with the VA – both in the past and now?



* Have you been in any of their facilities?
* Have you used the website and/or app? For what purpose(s)? *Both. Expert with the logins and feel well-activated. As much as I can, apps are great except for educational. For healthcare-related or to check claims, disability or to generate letters, I use the app. 

Now we're going to move to the financial portion of our discussion. I want to make sure that you’re only sharing what you’re willing – I have no additional information about you or your finances with the VA.

**Cohort 1 - Overpayments ✂️ ✂️ ✂️ ✂️**



* *Overview of their financial obligations*
    * (VBA debts) Have you had experience with owing the VA money? If you’re comfortable, could you tell me about that experience? *Yes, I have. 
        * What was the situation? *Most recently I have a post 9/11 overpayment for $83, I have not received a letter for it, I figured it was an oversight on the VA and they know I overpaid. Then I had an overpayment of $1200 and it just went away after I disputed it. I don’t remember it was so long ago. 
        * * There wasn’t much information on the letter, maybe a book stipend. 
        * When and how were you notified of the debt?
        * How long did it take you to pay it off? Or do you have a rough idea when you’ll pay it off?
    * (copays) Do you have any experience with medical copayments through the VA? *No. 
        * Do you receive any of these bills? If so, how? *It could have gotten lost in the mail, I don’t have issues with my mail. It probably is an overpayment of $83, I haven’t put too much thought on it. 
        * How long have you been receiving them?
        * How often do you receive them?

 \




* *Notifications/awareness*
    * (VBA debts) Tell me how you know you need to make a payment.
        * Tell me what prompts you to make a payment
        * What is your thought on the communication regarding what needs to be paid?
        * How are you paying the debts? (payment method, benefit reduction, how often, mobile/web)
        * Is there anything that could make things easier for you?
    * *(if relevant)* (copays) Tell me how you learn that you have a bill.
        * Tell me what prompts you to make a payment
        * What is your thought on how the bills are presented to you?
        * How are you paying the bills? (mobile/web, how often, payment method)
        * Is there anything that could make things easier for you?

 \




* *(if they have both)*
    * Consider both the copayment bills and the overpayment debts: in your mind, do these feel like different types of financial issues to you? Or do they belong in the same category?

**Prototype & Usability**

I'm going to be showing you a prototype of the mobile app, with some new features that we're testing out before we consider building them.

*(request they share screen)*

Please open up the Figma app, and I’ll be walking you through how to sign in.



* *(share test credentials with them)*
* *(after logging in, send them [prototype link](https://www.figma.com/proto/kRA7JHbthNrSLxTQHrzH8T/MFS---Overpayments---Copays-%7C-VA-Mobile?page-id=2001%3A429&node-id=7274-61308&p=f&viewport=24600%2C-1348%2C0.59&t=RzEWQo0ZfxtjJRxF-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=7274%3A61308&show-proto-sidebar=1) over Zoom chat)*

From home screen



* You're on the home screen of our pretend mobile app.
* Don’t yet click on anything: show me where to find what money you currently owe *Messages I would think. That would be it.
    * How clear was that to find? *I’m mindful of payment history and direct deposit. I like this overpayments debt tab and copays; I wouldn’t want to add another toggle. 
    * Tell me your thoughts on the title of that section.
        * What would you expect to find there?
        * Are there other names that would be a better description or make things easier to find? * I think this looks really good.
* Now click into that tab
    * What are your thoughts on the info presented here? 
    * Now that you see what’s in this section: any further thoughts on the name “payments”?
    * Regarding the info below the word "overpayments" – what would be the most helpful to see there? *No, it has due for debts. 
    * *No because I can see the whole page and can see payment to you. Very thought out page. 

Overpayment benefits debt

*(no payment option)* ❌ 💵 ❌



* Find what you currently owe for overpayment debts *I think this is good. you have the green arrow, question mark, disability benefit and details. 
    * How clear was that to find?
    * What can you tell me about the other debts on this screen?
* If a new debt arises, how would you expect to be notified? *It would be good if you get a notification, I can see it would be important for most people, if they can sign up for notifications.
* What do you need to know for each debt? *Access to the letter. To be able to view the VA letter would be helpful and payment due dates, the transaction history, Oh, I see it there now, I wouldn’t add anything. 
    * How easy/difficult is it to find relevant information?
* [point to a specific debt] What can you tell me about your activity here?
    * Is it clear when a payment is due?
    * Tell me about the Debt Letter section – what do you assume this is and how useful is it? *As long as you click it and see the letters, I think there is not anything better to do here. The VA app is good but it’s not good at post 9/11 and GI debts. 
    * *Getting notifications like you have a new letter or new amounts due. 
* If you pay off a debt, would you want to see it?
    * Here or anywhere else? *late transaction history or closure of debt. Maybe a payment availability for credit card. If I had a debt of something significant, I would track it every week. 
* Now we’re going to pretend that you don’t believe you’re going to have the money to make a payment on the debt in the next few months. Walk me through what you would do in this situation.
    * What sort of info or guidance might you look for? *I would look at the letter and phone number and look to see if there is a resources tab that has a number to call. Maybe for other users, I would click pay online, request help and pick an option.  Have a blurb of disputing debt.
    * Is it clear when you would need to start anything?
    * What are your thoughts on opening new windows for the information? *Click bill, request help, or pay in person.
* Were you aware of these options for financial help? If so, how did you learn?
* What else would you want to do here with regards to your debt? *Request a payment plan and call. Something with a payment plan and maybe have  a link for financial counseling. 
    * How would you expect to make payments?
    * What are your thoughts on this new section not having a payment option?
    * If this were to be built in real life, how likely would you be to use it? * A notification of the debt being resolved, and receipt and letter mailed. 

*(with payment option)* ✅ 💵 ✅



* Now I'm going to have you [open another prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/kRA7JHbthNrSLxTQHrzH8T/MFS---Overpayments---Copays-%7C-VA-Mobile?page-id=2001%3A429&node-id=7372-28070&p=f&viewport=24600%2C-1348%2C0.59&t=RzEWQo0ZfxtjJRxF-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=7372%3A28070&show-proto-sidebar=1) to view a different version.
    * If you are ready to make a payment on this debt, walk me through how you would do that. *The letter I would assume there would be a blurb and an envelope to resolve.
    * Talk to me about that experience of starting to make the payment (e.g. opening .gov, new sign-in, copying payment + account info)
    * After you’ve made a payment, what would you expect to see? When would you expect to see an update?
    * If this were to be built in real life, how likely would you be to use it? * It would be nice to have a pay online, not in person. Pay by phone is nice and just give them my card information. 
    * How would the likelihood of you using this compare to the previous version where you were not able to make payments?
* Now that we’ve gone through this section, do you have any other thoughts about what is here and how the information is presented?*No, it would be cool if you could copy and paste. It’s very clear.It would be easier to stay on the app. The VA app is not so easy to adjust. The VA webite is too convoluted versus the app. 
* What are your thoughts on how the sections and pages are labeled?
    * Are there other titles that would make more sense to you? *No, I can’t think of anything. I would have a pay result debt, pay online and takes me to the website, it would be nice to pay directly here with a credit card. 

    *I would have file number, social number to pay, but the problem is all these codes and that gets messed up. If you go into the VA app to message your doctor, they have so much, Chaplain, LGBTQ, it’s almost too much. Just give me the codes applicable to the debts I have. Too many deduction codes. Hopefully, at the letter it would have all the information. Putting the payment amount, name, daytime phone and deduction code. I guess the letter I would try to find it. 

* *(if relevant)* Can you tell me what you think of this experience vs what you have found on va.gov? * I would use it because it’s to use instead of and mailing it in. I would go with the link. 

Copayments: time-dependent and if relevant



* 

Those are all my questions. I’m going to check in with my team to see if anyone has any questions. If anyone would like to ask anything, you can unmute yourself and ask now.

Is there anything else you would like to share regarding managing finances that you haven’t yet shared?

**Consent to use video clips**



* I want to check once again that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners with your identifying information removed.
* Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?

**Thank-You and Closing**

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the digital experience and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
