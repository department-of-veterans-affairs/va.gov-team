Start recording.
•	I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? *Yes.
•	Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you? *Yes.
Discussion
Could you tell me a bit about yourself as a Veteran: what branch of the military did you serve, and when did you retire or separate? *I was in the Air Force, enlisted in 1979, and got out in 1986. 
How have you been involved with the VA – both in the past and now? 
•	Have you been in any of their facilities? * I get the majority of my healthcare through the VA. I do see a local doctor just to have that.
•	Have you used the website and/or app? For what purpose(s)? *Both on a regular basis. I go in and check my prescription, or what appointments I have, or order refills and check tracking on the app. Whatever the device I’m nearest, I prefer the computer,  I dislike doing things on the phone.
Now we're going to move to the financial portion of our discussion. I want to make sure that you’re only sharing what you’re willing – I have no additional information about you or your finances with the VA.

Cohort 2 - Copays ✂️ ✂️ ✂️ ✂️
•	Overview of their financial obligations
o	(copays) What is your experience with medical copayments through the VA? * The only copays I have are from my prescription drugs. I learned that I was doing something wrong last year, and I was giving away money that I didn’t need to. I would go to the website and go what do I owe you and pay. 
* We didn’t have any money and I called to ask if I can make a payment on the due bill and informed me about the disconnect from the website and reality. 
Do you receive any of these bills? If so, how? A letter in the mail.
	How long have you been receiving them?
	How often do you receive them? * I get the letter monthly.
o	(VBA debts) Have you had any debts as a result of a benefit overpayment?
	What was the situation?
	When and how were you notified of the debt? *No.
	How long did it take you to pay it off? Or do you have a rough idea when you’ll pay it off? *No, they stopped sending me a letter.


•	Notifications/awareness
o	(copays) Tell me how you learn that you have a bill.
	Tell me what prompts you to make a payment 
	What is your thought on how the bills are presented to you? 
	How are you paying the bills? (mobile/web, how often, payment method)
o	Is there anything that could make things easier for you
o	(if relevant) (VBA debts) Tell me how you know you need to make a payment.
	Tell me what prompts you to make a payment
	What is your thought on the communication regarding what needs to be paid? *This looks like everything I need.
	How are you paying the debts? (payment method, benefit reduction, how often, mobile/web)
	Is there anything that could make things easier for you? *That’s 100% spot on.


•	(if they have both)
o	Consider both the copayment bills and the overpayment debts: in your mind, do these feel like different types of financial issues to you? Or do they belong in the same category? 

Prototype & Usability
I'm going to be showing you a prototype of the mobile app, with some new features that we're testing out before we consider building them.
(request they share screen)
Please open up the Figma app, and I’ll be walking you through how to sign in.
•	(share test credentials with them)
•	(after logging in, send them prototype link over Zoom chat)
From home screen
•	You're on the home screen of our pretend mobile app.
•	Don’t yet click on anything: show me where to find what money you currently owe *I would click in details or that might not work, but it would be a good start or show.
o	How clear was that to find?
o	Tell me your thoughts on the title of that section.
	What would you expect to find there? ? *I know there’s an arrow and bubble and it will say, go here to do this and that, and then it kind of gives you a tour, the first time you log into to it. I always click and read and it was there before using the app, I would of known where to go.

	Are there other names that would be a better description or make things easier to find?
•	Now click into that tab
o	What are your thoughts on the info presented here? *No, like the direct deposit , I don’t know what it would be used for. 
o	Now that you see what’s in this section: any further thoughts on the name “payments”? *This looks like everything I need.
o	Regarding the info below the word "copay" – what would be the most helpful to see there? 
o	Copayments
(no payment option) ❌ 💵 ❌
•	Find what you currently owe for copayments
o	How clear was that to find? * Looks like I owe $200 and Tampa Hospital  wants $50.
o	What can you tell me about the other copayments on this screen?  *The two pieces of information is the account number and how much. I also look at the due dates because there is a late fee, and I have to juggle that payment with Social Security payments. Nothing is missing.
•	After you have a medical appointment, when would you expect to see the copayment appear here?
o	How would you expect to be notified?
•	What do you need to know for each copay due?
o	How easy/difficult is it to find relevant information?
•	Are you usually visiting different VA locations for your healthcare? Just one.
o	How clearly is everything presented here? (do they know the copays from locations are grouped?) *It’s very clear.
•	[point to a specific copay] What can you tell me about your activity here?
o	Is it clear when the payment is due? * It’s clear.
•	If you pay off a copay, would you want to see it? * I would expect to see the confirmation that I made the payment and how many days it takes to process. I always put my wife’s email address to show that I paid it. 
* I would probably go to the statement, and I have a mask and folders, and I will pull up the PDF and store it. I’m mostly storing it rather than viewing it. * I would go the home page, VA payment history. No, this is the money tab. 
o	Here or anywhere else? 
o	Are there any here that you believe are paid off? How clear is it?
•	Let’s pretend you see an error – [point to a specific copay] one of the copays is for an appointment that you did not have. What would you do?  *I would hit payments and copays and a combination of looking at payment history. Then I would go back to the copays and look where it says I had a bill to pay. I bet they would be in the statement and a number on there to call. I call the number first. 
•	I would call and there’s always that fear if I mess up, I lose my VA benefits. Even if there is anything I can’t do, at least they can put notes, that I called at least. 

o	What sort of info or guidance might you look for?
•	Now we’re going to pretend that you don’t believe you’re going to have the money to pay the most recent copay bills. Walk me through what you would do in this situation.
o	What sort of info or guidance might you look for?
o	Is it clear when you would have to start something?
o	What are your thoughts on opening new windows for the information?
•	Were you aware of these options for financial help? If so, how did you learn?
•	What else would you want to do here with regards to your copays?
o	How would you expect to make payments?
o	What are your thoughts on this new section not having a payment option?
o	If this were to be built in real life, how likely would you be to use it? *I’m don’t have va.pay .gov pinned because I’m paranoid. The impression I’m getting is that I’m going to be able to make payments on this app but still not clear that I don’t need to go to pay.gov. I would go to copays and then I would go to review details and somewhere go to a current statement if there were a triangle box. * Would use the app.
(with payment option) ✅ 💵 ✅
•	Now I'm going to have you open another prototype to view a different version. (with payment option)
o	If you are ready to make a payment on this bill, walk me through how you would do that. *I see the paybill and click that. I tap on the pay.gov. I don’t even know where you would go to pay in person. 
o	Talk to me about that experience of starting to make the payment (e.g. opening .gov, new sign-in, copying payment + account info) * I always pay on the computer. I would be upset they didn’t give me a link before going onto my .gov here. 
o	After you’ve paid this bill, what would you expect to see? When would you expect to see an update? *I would go over to review details. Then go back to pay.gov.
o	If this were to be built in real life, how likely would you be to use it? *That is normal method of operation with mostly everything you’re dealing with. 
o	How would the likelihood of you using this compare to the previous version where you were not able to make payments? *This is one stop shop. I love that.
•	(if user has not brought them up already) Talk to me about your monthly statements for copays
o	Were you aware of them?
o	Do you read them now? If so, what purpose do they serve? What are you doing with them?
o	Walk me through exploring them in the prototype here.
o	What are your thoughts on the PDFs here?
•	Now that we’ve gone through this section, any other thoughts you’d like to share on what is here and how the information is presented?
•	What are your thoughts on how the sections and pages are labeled?
o	Are there other titles that would make more sense to you? 
•	(if relevant) Can you tell me what you think of this experience vs what you have found on va.gov? *I get the bill, go on the computer, look over the bill and go to pay.gov and pay it. If I didn’t have that piece of paper, this would be the best option. Knowing there is a disconnection between the website and the mail, I wonder if there is a disconnection with this new app, and it hasn’t been resolved. *Maybe there could be a running total like copays, and today you paid $500 of the $700 you owe. I would feel comfortable that they are tracking this for me. 
Overpayments: time-dependent, and if relevant

Those are all my questions. I’m going to check in with my team to see if anyone has any questions. If anyone would like to ask anything, you can unmute yourself and ask now.
Is there anything else you would like to share regarding managing finances that you haven’t yet shared? *No, people have worked hard to get here, good job. *When I needed help, I didn’t do any web searching, I just looked up an old statement and called the number. 
Consent to use video clips
•	I want to check once again that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners with your identifying information removed.
•	Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?
