Start recording.



* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? Yes
* Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you? Yes

**Discussion**

Could you tell me a bit about yourself as a Veteran: what branch of the military did you serve, and when did you retire or separate? I was in the [redacted] for 9 years as a [redacted], I got out in 2022. 

How have you been involved with the VA ‚Äì both in the past and now? I have gotten 100 percent of my care; I got [redacted] there. I [redacted] in 2023. I called my doctor about [redacted] and I learned they could help me. They covered everything [redacted]. 



* Have you been in any of their facilities?
* Have you used the website and/or app? For what purpose(s)? I use the website more but I use the app if I need to know information. I can tell you how to do thing both on the app and the site. I use the app fi I am on the go if I need to cancel/reschedule an appointment, if I need to message a provider, I can add things to my calendar, I can order my medications, look at refills and see when prescription expires. Uses more when on the go. Questions come up. Like I have a video call in 14 days then I go check if it‚Äôs not on my calendar but if I am home I use my laptop. 

Now we're going to move to the financial portion of our discussion. I want to make sure that you‚Äôre only sharing what you‚Äôre willing ‚Äì I have no additional information about you or your finances with the VA.

* *Overview of their financial obligations*
    * (VBA debts) Have you had experience with owing the VA money? If you‚Äôre comfortable, could you tell me about that experience? Yes. So I had registered for last [redacted] I thought I was mentally ready and I was wrong. I wasn‚Äôt ready with [redacted], my [redacted], they paid me and my school. I had to let them know I dropped a class so by that time I paid the books stipend, housing and tuition, I had to send emails out, and I had a bill for everything and I had to pay it back. 
        * What was the situation?
        * When and how were you notified of the debt? I received a letter; I think it was a letter. It could‚Äôve been an email but I know for a fac tit was a letter. 
        * How long did it take you to pay it off? Or do you have a rough idea when you‚Äôll pay it off? The paper told me to go to the site and I look at what I owed and I don‚Äôt remember the time restriction. If something is on my radar I keep it on my calendar and know when I make payments. 
* 
* *Notifications/awareness*
    * (VBA debts) Tell me how you know you need to make a payment.
        * Tell me what prompts you to make a payment
        * What is your thought on the communication regarding what needs to be paid?
        * How are you paying the debts? (payment method, benefit reduction, how often, mobile/web) I went on the site and paid with my credit card and they gave me a confirmed and sent a physical copy that my debts have been paid. 
        * What could‚Äôve made it easier: No I think it was straight forward for what you were supposed to fill out and it had instructions for what you needed to fill out. You have to be very specific for when you make the payments.

**Prototype & Usability**

I'm going to be showing you a prototype of the mobile app, with some new features that we're testing out before we consider building them.

*(request they share screen)*

Please open up the Figma app, and I‚Äôll be walking you through how to sign in.



* *(share test credentials with them)*
* *(after logging in, send them¬†[prototype link](https://www.figma.com/proto/kRA7JHbthNrSLxTQHrzH8T/MFS---Overpayments---Copays-%7C-VA-Mobile?page-id=2001%3A429&node-id=7274-61308&p=f&viewport=24600%2C-1348%2C0.59&t=RzEWQo0ZfxtjJRxF-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=7274%3A61308&show-proto-sidebar=1)¬†over Zoom chat)*

From home screen



* You're on the home screen of our pretend mobile app.
* Don‚Äôt yet click on anything: show me where to find what money you currently owe: That‚Äôs a good question. Payments.
    * How clear was that to find? It was logical because its under payments, it could go with copays, payments and overpayments. 
    * Tell me your thoughts on the title of that section.
        * What would you expect to find there?
        * Are there other names that would be a better description or make things easier to find? No, without making it complicated it should have everything payment-related stuff so it‚Äôs easy. I was caught off guard at first because I haven‚Äôt don‚Äôt it. Payments show all payments before because it shows my history and I would see the overpayments. 
* Now click into that tab
    * What are your thoughts on the info presented here?
    * Now that you see what‚Äôs in this section: any further thoughts on the name ‚Äúpayments‚Äù?
    * Regarding the info below the word "overpayments" ‚Äì what would be the most helpful to see there? No I think it is self-explanatory. 

Overpayment benefits debt

*(no payment option)*¬†‚ùå üíµ ‚ùå



* Find what you currently owe for overpayment debts
    * How clear was that to find? It looks like I owe for housing, pension, and Gi for tuition.
    * What else would you want to know from here: no because if they have a question this is really helpful to know and they should have gotten the letter as to why they got the debt. I think that is helpful if they had questions. 
    * Next steps to finding out why you have the debt: Um do you mean if I still have the balance: I think if I hadn‚Äôt gotten the letter and I was caught off guard I would call, there‚Äôs a number on the letters we get. 
    * What would you be looking for: I would be looking for the 1800 number to call about my debt. Maybe have the number here so they have a resource to call instead of looking for the reward letter or searching for the number.  
    * Other information: I think that is it. It has everything here. It has the letters you can download if you need to see I guess. I don‚Äôt know if its because this is a trial but I would expect to be able to click it and be able to click and review it and download it. 
    * How useful would it be: I think it would be useful if someone didn‚Äôt know why they were in debt. I knew I would have to pay it back so I was expecting it. If they knew they dropped out it should have been expected. The letters would be helpful but you have a lot of access to things of the site but I think a desktop would be helpful. My phone is for quick reference not digging into things, just quick glances. I can see how it would be helpful if they were caught off guard. 
    * Just a letter here but cant see it, thoughts, next steps: I feel like it shouldn‚Äôt show the letter if you cant view it. It says they sent a letter but I never received it so it would be triggering because they can‚Äôt click to see it and haven‚Äôt received it. 
    * Anything else you expect to do here: How do I request finical help, here it says to pay full balance or request financial help. 
    * What would you be looking for: I would think it would have contact information and office hours, email. Just contact information there. 
    * What can you tell me about the other debts on this screen?
* If a new debt arises, how would you expect to be notified?
* What do you need to know for each debt?
    * How easy/difficult is it to find relevant information?
* [point to a specific debt] What can you tell me about your activity here?
    * Is it clear when a payment is due?
    * Tell me about the Debt Letter section ‚Äì what do you assume this is and how useful is it? 
* If you pay off a debt, would you want to see it?
    * Here or anywhere else?
* Now we‚Äôre going to pretend that you don‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre going to have the money to make a payment on the debt in the next few months. Walk me through what you would do in this situation.
    * What sort of info or guidance might you look for?
    * Is it clear when you would need to start anything?
    * What are your thoughts on opening new windows for the information?
* Were you aware of these options for financial help? If so, how did you learn?
* What else would you want to do here with regards to your debt?
    * How would you expect to make payments?
    * What are your thoughts on this new section not having a payment option?
    * If this were to be built in real life, how likely would you be to use it? I would use it as a quick glance to see payments and history. Anything else like letters I would use my desktop.

*(with payment option)*¬†‚úÖ üíµ ‚úÖ



* Now I'm going to have you¬†[open another prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/kRA7JHbthNrSLxTQHrzH8T/MFS---Overpayments---Copays-%7C-VA-Mobile?page-id=2001%3A429&node-id=7372-28070&p=f&viewport=24600%2C-1348%2C0.59&t=RzEWQo0ZfxtjJRxF-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=7372%3A28070&show-proto-sidebar=1)¬†to view a different version.

Thoughts on options here: I think this is really helpful because it gives you a way to resolve an issue or get in contact with someone. It gives you steps to do a financial status report. 



    * If you are ready to make a payment on this debt, walk me through how you would do that.: Oh okay. I would get that information from here. Here is the codes that you would need to put in for your payment. Initially the first statement you say that you will need to have this information to pay online. People need to be through in reading. It is easy to fill in if you read the first sentence. 
    * How to make that clear: Highlight it so people don‚Äôt just look, I didn‚Äôt even read it but because I have done it before the first thing that would have caught my eye is the balance. The sentence might have to be after the information. 
    * Talk to me about that experience of starting to make the payment (e.g. opening .gov, new sign-in, copying payment + account info): I think it is straightforward. 
    * What would your process be getting the information into the site: I feel like that wouldn‚Äôt be safe. I feel like another thing that it could do was generate but then you‚Äôd have to go to pay online. I feel like you could pay online then read this stuff. 
    * How would you get the account number from the app into the pay site: Just copy and paste it.
    * After you‚Äôve made a payment, what would you expect to see? When would you expect to see an update?
    * If this were to be built in real life, how likely would you be to use it? I would definitely use it if it had all of the information because it has everything I wouldn‚Äôt need to go to my laptop. 
    * How would the likelihood of you using this compare to the previous version where you were not able to make payments? For sure likely to use this one because it is like a one stop shop. 
* Now that we‚Äôve gone through this section, do you have any other thoughts about what is here and how the information is presented? Um, nope. 
* How useful for if you couldn‚Äôt pay: request help the resolve debt then I would do what I need to do for the debt. All of the options are there for the debt. 
* Aware of the assistance: if I read the paperwork yes there‚Äôs a number to call to ask questions or ask for help with the debt. 
* What are your thoughts on how the sections and pages are labeled? 
    * Are there other titles that would make more sense to you?

Copayments: time-dependent and if relevant

Thoughts on information here and what is useful: 

Statements, useful: I look at statements when I get care through community care. It just lets me know I don‚Äôt have to pay for anything. I get those pretty often. 

Statement here in the app: I think it is perfect here as along as the date here is when the visit was or when they got the medication because the dates don‚Äôt match. It can be confusing when the dates don‚Äôt match. Here it says outpatient care was on the 22 and here it was on the 22. 

Anything else with the statements: If I need to share information with a doctor or show proof it was paid I would keep it as proof. I would download it on my computer. I might print it. Theres just so many letters I get, the VA does such a good job at knowing you get paper copies of everything, there‚Äôs less memory on my computer or phone. I have a file for my VA stuff. I see how it is useful of seeing all of the charges. 

Looking for older statements: I would go to PDF statements. Hopefully it is my date 

How hard would it be to find the older statements: this person doesn‚Äôt have much but I wonder if there‚Äôs a max, if they are seen often if they have to scroll and if there‚Äôs a limit on what they can see. I am seen weekly. I wouldn‚Äôt want to scroll all the way down. There should be a max . 

Noticed there‚Äôs an error, next step: I would click on appointment and then help then look at which one helps. This is good information. I am not sure it should be a help at the top. What if someone doesn‚Äôt know that‚Äôs an option to click. It should be a link at the bottom under $20, especially if they aren‚Äôt tech savvy, if it‚Äôs a link that takes you to that page instead of the help button

Anything else that is helpful for this bill: Other than that information to pay it, the school debt had the help button was more visible instead of searching for it. How do I request financial help, it‚Äôs not clear here how to request help. 

Ready to pay: Click pay. Then pay online. 

Locating account number: That is useful because the account number is here and you can copy and paste it. That would be nice to past it. I like the prompt that where can I find my account number and it should the statements but maybe a screen shot of this where it shows them they can find it in the app as well. This example is useful but an example of where they can find it in the app would be useful as well. If you get a paper copy in hand you can find it but having the screenshot of the app as a reminder would be helpful. 

How would this page be clear to copy the account number: I think it is straightforward. 

Thoughts on labels or structures: I think the things I mentioned are it, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything else I can add. 

I feel like it is helpful to have it all broken down in the app and it goes right there. 

Those are all my questions. I‚Äôm going to check in with my team to see if anyone has any questions. If anyone would like to ask anything, you can unmute yourself and ask now.

Is there anything else you would like to share regarding managing finances that you haven‚Äôt yet shared?

**Consent to use video clips**



* I want to check once again that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners with your identifying information removed.
* Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?

**Thank-You and Closing**

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the digital experience and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again and enjoy the rest of your day!
