Start recording.



* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? Yes
* Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you? Yes

**Discussion**

Could you tell me a bit about yourself as a Veteran: what branch of the military did you serve, and when did you retire or separate? In the Marines from 2007 to 2011. 

How have you been involved with the VA – both in the past and now? I first got service connected in 2017; in June I was 100 percent. I have been dealing with the VA for a few years I guess. I have been to VA from IN, UT, WA, TX, and PR. I have been to a few VA’s



* Have you been in any of their facilities?
* App: it is user friendly as the updates have been made in the last few years. The advancements of the software have been good,. It is slowly been modernized. 
* Mobile over website: the mobile I do 2fa with finger so it is quicker, you can do everyone expect travel claims. It is comparable to the website. Theres a few things you can’t do but you can do almost everything form the phone. 
* Easier on mobile: Yes it is faster it takes seconds, if I do the websites, I have to go through id.me and it takes longer. 
* Have you used the website and/or app? For what purpose(s)?

Now we're going to move to the financial portion of our discussion. I want to make sure that you’re only sharing what you’re willing – I have no additional information about you or your finances with the VA.

✂️ Split paths: [Cohort 1 (overpayments) starts here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/combined_va_debt_portal/mobile/conversation_guide.md#cohort-1---overpayments-%EF%B8%8F-%EF%B8%8F-%EF%B8%8F-%EF%B8%8F) ↔️ [Cohort 2 (copays) starts here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/combined_va_debt_portal/mobile/conversation_guide.md#cohort-2---copays-%EF%B8%8F-%EF%B8%8F-%EF%B8%8F-%EF%B8%8F) ✂️

**Cohort 1 - Overpayments ✂️ ✂️ ✂️ ✂️**



* *Overview of their financial obligations*
    * (VBA debts) Have you had experience with owing the VA money? If you’re comfortable, could you tell me about that experience? Yes I was in school from 2021 to 2024 and I was in WR&E and overpaid they took 25 a month and it was finally paid off. It was automatically taken from my monthly deposit. 
        * What was the situation?
        * When and how were you notified of the debt? I wasn’t notified. Then I happened to look at my deposit and it didn’t look right so I called and they explained to me that I had a school overpayment. So, I received a letter but I don’t recall it. They said they sent one. on the website where it say overpayment it didn’t show there at all. I was being deducted and it didn’t show there, I had to call to know. 
        * How to make it easier: Digital world these days so a notification in the app or email would have helped because sometimes they mail multiple letters during claims and appointments. If I get it digitally. I may not open mail immediately so getting it digitally would have helped me understand. 
        * How long did it take you to pay it off? Or do you have a rough idea when you’ll pay it off?
    * (copays) Do you have any experience with medical copayments through the VA? Only once in WA and it was $50 years ago. Since then I have never paid anything. 

 \




* *Notifications/awareness*
    * (VBA debts) Tell me how you know you need to make a payment.
        * Tell me what prompts you to make a payment
        * What is your thought on the communication regarding what needs to be paid?
        * How are you paying the debts? (payment method, benefit reduction, how often, mobile/web)
        * Is there anything that could make things easier for you?
    * *(if relevant)* (copays) Tell me how you learn that you have a bill.
        * Tell me what prompts you to make a payment
        * What is your thought on how the bills are presented to you?
        * How are you paying the bills? (mobile/web, how often, payment method)
        * Is there anything that could make things easier for you?

 \




* *(if they have both)*
    * Consider both the copayment bills and the overpayment debts: in your mind, do these feel like different types of financial issues to you? Or do they belong in the same category?

**Prototype & Usability**

I'm going to be showing you a prototype of the mobile app, with some new features that we're testing out before we consider building them.

*(request they share screen)*

Please open up the Figma app, and I’ll be walking you through how to sign in.



* *(share test credentials with them)*
* *(after logging in, send them [prototype link](https://www.figma.com/proto/kRA7JHbthNrSLxTQHrzH8T/MFS---Overpayments---Copays-%7C-VA-Mobile?page-id=2001%3A429&node-id=7274-61308&p=f&viewport=24600%2C-1348%2C0.59&t=RzEWQo0ZfxtjJRxF-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=7274%3A61308&show-proto-sidebar=1) over Zoom chat)*

From home screen



* You're on the home screen of our pretend mobile app.
* Don’t yet click on anything: show me where to find what money you currently owe: I would think it would be under last payment or under the payments page. 
    * How clear was that to find?
    * Tell me your thoughts on the title of that section: I think the title is clear. Yeah I mean think it is fine. 
        * What would you expect to find there? This makes sense for overpayments and debts, this makes sense. 
        * What would be helpful to know from here: I think this information is clear for the total and then there are 2 bills so with that you should know if there are copays due or an overpayment. You should get a receipt or a bill. For debt, veterans look at their deposits each month so if they were overpaid they probably know. 
        * Are there other names that would be a better description or make things easier to find?
* Now click into that tab
    * What are your thoughts on the info presented here?  
    * Now that you see what’s in this section: any further thoughts on the name “payments”?
    * Regarding the info below the word "overpayments" – what would be the most helpful to see there?

Overpayment benefits debt

*(no payment option)* ❌ 💵 ❌



* Find what you currently owe for overpayment debts It is clear and what I would expect to see here. I don’t know how you would be overpaid for books but it is listed. Yeah it is pretty straight forward. 
    * How clear was that to find?
    * What can you tell me about the other debts on this screen?
* If a new debt arises, how would you expect to be notified? Um some type of on payments, a lot of apps when there’s an update there’s a red dot so like a dot or number above payments that you can see like a notification you can click and see the information. 
* What do you need to know for each debt? Everything is great, what was shocking was a late few, if it is automatically deducted why would there be a late fee being calculated in. It looks like how it should I would say.  It has the due date, it says you had a letter, the information is straightforward.
* What to do from here: See why you have it: even if you see the debt letter, maybe direct contact information to reach out. 
* Other reasons to reach out: I would want to call to talk to someone if I didn’t understand why there was an overpayment. 
* Where would you find that: I would assume it was on the letter but they might have the standard VA letter, if you have a contact block on why I might have this debt that would be cool because you could reach out immediately instead of going through the 1800 number and being transferred to them. Direct contact numbers would be good. 
* Tap into why might I have this debt: That is standard but it gives you three options. If there was a way to know exactly why and a direct contact line. If you are in this situation you know you withdrew, had more payments, or on academic probation instead of having to think about it. 
* Do you want the contact information here: Maybe below this link I clicked. 
    * How easy/difficult is it to find relevant information?
* [point to a specific debt] What can you tell me about your activity here?
    * Is it clear when a payment is due?
    * Tell me about the Debt Letter section – what do you assume this is and how useful is it? If you can click it and see the history. 
* If you pay off a debt, would you want to see it? Closed or some type of wording that is has been paid. 
    * Here or anywhere else?
* Now we’re going to pretend that you don’t believe you’re going to have the money to make a payment on the debt in the next few months. Walk me through what you would do in this situation.
    * What sort of info or guidance might you look for?
    * Is it clear when you would need to start anything?
    * What are your thoughts on opening new windows for the information?
* Were you aware of these options for financial help? If so, how did you learn?
* What else would you want to do here with regards to your debt?
    * How would you expect to make payments?
    * What are your thoughts on this new section not having a payment option?
    * If this were to be built in real life, how likely would you be to use it? It gives me enough to go off of so I would use it. You don’t need to look to far. You know exactly what you are being deducted by. It is very convenient. 

*(with payment option)* ✅ 💵 ✅



* Now I'm going to have you [open another prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/kRA7JHbthNrSLxTQHrzH8T/MFS---Overpayments---Copays-%7C-VA-Mobile?page-id=2001%3A429&node-id=7372-28070&p=f&viewport=24600%2C-1348%2C0.59&t=RzEWQo0ZfxtjJRxF-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=7372%3A28070&show-proto-sidebar=1) to view a different version.
    * Thoughts: you can review details so I think it would give me itemized information and you can resolve debt here so you can pay it off here. I would think you could get to a payment screen. I like pay online, other ways to pay, and request help. It simplifies the process. If I want to take care of this I can click resolve debt I can pay or other ways to pay or request help to see the help they can provide if I don’t have the money. 
    * Tab that: Yeah that makes sense. That makes sense, it is like the creditors your can dispute. I think this is great. 
    * If you are ready to make a payment on this debt, walk me through how you would do that.:
    * Talk to me about that experience of starting to make the payment (e.g. opening .gov, new sign-in, copying payment + account info): I have never seen this before. For the veteran information, payee number, maybe this information on the link on the app, it should auto filled because I wouldn’t know the file number or payee number or deduction code. It should be auto filled for convenience. I don’t even think you can copy and paste from the app. The first/last name and number are standard so that is straightforward. 
    * If it didn’t auto fill but you had this, how would it be: I don’t think you can copy and paste in the app. I don’t think you can. I would have to switch screen and remember it and type it in and hope that when you go back and fourth that it doesn't start you over. 
    * After you’ve made a payment, what would you expect to see? When would you expect to see an update?  Some type of confirmation, an email that the payment has been processed and when I go look at the balance that is has been reduced. 
    * Did you know this was an option: No I did not know. 
    * If this were to be built in real life, how likely would you be to use it? Well if that’s the only option then I would go through the process if it was the most convenient option father than talking to someone on the phone. It’s convenient enough. 
    * How would the likelihood of you using this compare to the previous version where you were not able to make payments? The second one for sure because it gives itemized options, the second one is better. 
* Now that we’ve gone through this section, do you have any other thoughts about what is here and how the information is presented? The only thing that could be confusing for individuals that haven’t seen it is the deduction codes but if you have had school benefits you should be aware of all of the information. If you were overpaid and know what program you are using. 
* What are your thoughts on how the sections and pages are labeled?
    * Are there other titles that would make more sense to you?
* *(if relevant)* Can you tell me what you think of this experience vs what you have found on va.gov?

Copayments: time-dependent and if relevant



* Information here, what is important to know: The va here it occurred, you can review details for what, pay bill, yeah it looks straight forward. 
* What would you need to know for the first one: Maybe have the date it occurred under reviewed details. It does have that, the medication you were charged for. It is straightforward. You can also see the account number and you can copy it from the app and download the statement . 
* Statement, do you use those: For sure, I always download those for record just in case anything happens
* Would you do that form the app: yes because I do that form the app now. I have access from the app immediately it was it concise and straightforward
* It is an invoice, if you pay by mail you can enter information, it tells you where to mail it to, this is , I would assume this would help a lot of veterans with the process because it is the formal documentation, it is like a bill. It should help a lot of veterans that have overpayments or copayments. 
* Error for prescriptions: I would click it; I would want some type of was to dispute that I did not receive something like that.
* What would you look for: once I click it, I don’t know if it doesn’t click if there was a way that there was a way to confirm you received or deny that you received it. 
* Anywhere you would expect contact information: It should be on the PDF so that has all of the information you would need. 
* Pretend you are ready to pay, what would you do: Okay. Yeah it gives 4 options so I would say older vets may want to pay by phone or mail or in person. Younger vets my pay online but it gives 4 options. 
* Lets do online: Okay. The account number it’s the same thing as before having to remember that number. You can copy that number and enter it in but I will say when you copy it and paste it, will it try to add it all into one cell or separate it into the separate cells. I know websites can do it but I have seen it done where you have to delete.
* Anything else to add or to mention that could be useful: So on this page for copays it doesn’t have the account, it doesn’t have the information so partial payment or you forgot the total so it should have the total amount owed and the amount you want to pay, that information on the payment page would be easier I guess. . 
* Anything else that could be useful for the app: I think that is pretty much all

Those are all my questions. I’m going to check in with my team to see if anyone has any questions. If anyone would like to ask anything, you can unmute yourself and ask now.

Is there anything else you would like to share regarding managing finances that you haven’t yet shared?

**Consent to use video clips**



* I want to check once again that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners with your identifying information removed.
* Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?

**Thank-You and Closing**
