# Notes by Perigean. Conversation Guide used as the structure for notes.

Start recording.



* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? Yes, that is perfectly fine. 
* Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you? Yes, that is perfectly fine. 

**Discussion**

Could you tell me a bit about yourself as a Veteran: what branch of the military did you serve, and when did you retire or separate? I don’t feel comfortable disclosing that. 

How have you been involved with the VA – both in the past and now? Yeah so far I have had a good experience. For the most part sometimes the medical experience is it straightforward. The financial side is where I struggle with and I look for the most guidance. 

Website/app:” the app. 

Only the app or the website: the website but the way my brain works I need my laptop because it is a serious thing so I need my laptop. Anything finance I use my laptop. 

App over website: the app when I am just checking my benefits or when I need to book appointments or get prescriptions I gravitate towards the app. 



* Have you been in any of their facilities?
* Have you used the website and/or app? For what purpose(s)?

Now we're going to move to the financial portion of our discussion. I want to make sure that you’re only sharing what you’re willing – I have no additional information about you or your finances with the VA.

**Cohort 1 - Overpayments ✂️ ✂️ ✂️ ✂️**



* *Overview of their financial obligations*
    * (VBA debts) Have you had experience with owing the VA money? If you’re comfortable, could you tell me about that experience? Yes, I do. At some point I fell behind on payments and I was finding a way to pay that back. 
        * What was the situation?
        * When and how were you notified of the debt? I was notified by letter. I think I received a paper letter and that’s how I got my letter. I am not comfortable with paperless because I might miss it or it  could be hard to find them or forget it. I prefer the snail mail. 
        * How long did it take you to pay it off? Or do you have a rough idea when you’ll pay it off? I think what I do is just set aside time to go through it and make a payment and carve out sometime.
        * Letter each time you have to pay or less: frequently like each time I get treatment and that’s when I know I need to make a payment. 
        * Outside of copayments, more or less: less frequently, maybe quarterly, 3-4 months I would get a reminder about the outstanding balance. 
        * Are you making payments quarterly or more: I make it when I get the letters. 
        * How could it be 
    * (copays) Do you have any experience with medical copayments through the VA?
        * Do you receive any of these bills? If so, how?
        * How long have you been receiving them?
        * How often do you receive them?

 \




* *Notifications/awareness*
    * (VBA debts) Tell me how you know you need to make a payment.
        * Tell me what prompts you to make a payment
        * What is your thought on the communication regarding what needs to be paid?
        * How are you paying the debts? (payment method, benefit reduction, how often, mobile/web)
        * Is there anything that could make things easier for you?
    * *(if relevant)* (copays) Tell me how you learn that you have a bill.
        * Tell me what prompts you to make a payment
        * What is your thought on how the bills are presented to you?
        * How are you paying the bills? (mobile/web, how often, payment method)
        * Is there anything that could make things easier for you? When it comes to easier, any debt outside of that maybe get option to debt to be forgiven or make payments smaller and more doable. 
        * Communication now: right now it is the balance and how to pay them and what I should be paying so I try to pay them as much as I can. 

 \




* *(if they have both)*
    * Consider both the copayment bills and the overpayment debts: in your mind, do these feel like different types of financial issues to you? Or do they belong in the same category? Yeah I think of anything when I look at medical payments because it is for health and it is the frequency of them they become of type of mind and priority and I think outstanding balance is that I know I need to make those payments because of my income it adds that stress so I just wait for that letter to arrive to make the payment. That way I can make sure I take care of myself mentally and physically. 

**Prototype & Usability**

I'm going to be showing you a prototype of the mobile app, with some new features that we're testing out before we consider building them.

*(request they share screen)*

Please open up the Figma app, and I’ll be walking you through how to sign in.



* *(share test credentials with them)*
* *(after logging in, send them [prototype link](https://www.figma.com/proto/kRA7JHbthNrSLxTQHrzH8T/MFS---Overpayments---Copays-%7C-VA-Mobile?page-id=2001%3A429&node-id=7274-61308&p=f&viewport=24600%2C-1348%2C0.59&t=RzEWQo0ZfxtjJRxF-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=7274%3A61308&show-proto-sidebar=1) over Zoom chat)*

From home screen



* You're on the home screen of our pretend mobile app.
* Don’t yet click on anything: show me where to find what money you currently owe
    * How clear was that to find? I think opening this app I think of anything I would look at the messages to see if I had notifications about the debts . If that was empty I would click on payments. 
    * Tell me your thoughts on the title of that section.
        * What would you expect to find there?
    * Are there other names that would be a better description or make things easier to find? Payments: clear: I think it is clear enough. I think it is something I might be receiving but payments could be anything. Payments is good or something that says balance. Or outstanding balance would be great so I know exactly what it is. 
        * 
* Now click into that tab
    * What are your thoughts on the info presented here? 
    * Now that you see what’s in this section: any further thoughts on the name “payments”? It is straight forward and the boxes are well. The debt I owe to the va, it is clear and understandable. 
    * Regarding the info below the word "overpayments" – what would be the most helpful to see there? Maybe if they had an option for be to make those payments easier. Then have the copays broken down into prescription and medical copays but this is still very understandable. 

Overpayment benefits debt

*(no payment option)* ❌ 💵 ❌



* Find what you currently owe for overpayment debts
    * How clear was that to find? 
    * What can you tell me about the other debts on this screen? I owe 3760 and have 4 debts. Can I tap on it. I think it shows the 4 debts that are part of that overpayments and one of them is the post 9/11, I think it has already been paid for so it is already been paid but is good to see I was able to pay it. I see everything else and the balance I owe. I appreciate the bold text approach to the debts. 
    * Next steps: details like the ones at the bottom contact the US department of treasury, I would want a number directly so I can work that out. I see the other one will reduce my benefits so I would click review details to see that. 
* If a new debt arises, how would you expect to be notified? I think maybe if I owe something I would refresh it and see it and if I see don’t see it I would go to the home page and wait until I get a push notification to let me know when it is posted. 
* What do you need to know for each debt?
    * How easy/difficult is it to find relevant information?
* [point to a specific debt] What can you tell me about your activity here? It is complete enough. It shows the balance owed, when its owed. I could call to see if I could work the date out. I see the why I might have this debt. I like the history of payments made and the debt letter history. 
    * Is it clear when a payment is due?
    * Tell me about the Debt Letter section – what do you assume this is and how useful is it? I think the date is when they sent the letter and I would want the copy of it. Seeing the date is enough. I think if I tapped on this I could see the letter in PDF form. I find this very helpful. 
* If you pay off a debt, would you want to see it? I would want a final letter here stating that the debt is closed and the final payments has been made and the balance is zero and there’s no further action required on my end. 
    * Here or anywhere else? Maybe here a way to make a payment now. Or how to work something out to continue to make payments doable. Like a contact us to work something out. Kinda like PayPal or make the payments more doable. 
* Now we’re going to pretend that you don’t believe you’re going to have the money to make a payment on the debt in the next few months. Walk me through what you would do in this situation.
    * What sort of info or guidance might you look for? 
    * Is it clear when you would need to start anything?
    * What are your thoughts on opening new windows for the information?
* Were you aware of these options for financial help? If so, how did you learn?
* What else would you want to do here with regards to your debt? 
    * How would you expect to make payments?
    * What are your thoughts on this new section not having a payment option?
    * If this were to be built in real life, how likely would you be to use it?

*(with payment option)* ✅ 💵 ✅



* Now I'm going to have you [open another prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/kRA7JHbthNrSLxTQHrzH8T/MFS---Overpayments---Copays-%7C-VA-Mobile?page-id=2001%3A429&node-id=7372-28070&p=f&viewport=24600%2C-1348%2C0.59&t=RzEWQo0ZfxtjJRxF-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=7372%3A28070&show-proto-sidebar=1) to view a different version.
    * If you are ready to make a payment on this debt, walk me through how you would do that: If I am looking for a different option I would click on resolve debt to see if there is another option there with neutral understanding. Okay yeah. I like this. You can pay online, other ways to pay. I would click other ways to pay. Okay pay by phone and pay by mail. 
    * Something else: I thought that I would be getting other options like they could help me by making the payments doable but I got options to pay on phone or by mail. 
    * Expect under request help: I think initially I thought that when I would get a number to contact them but now I see other ways to pay. I imagine it would be how they could make it more doable for me. Yeah this is exactly what I was initially looking for. I would now tap on request a payment plan to see the options. It gives general options; I would go online to work something out. If that’s tricky I would give them a call. I would also request debt relief to see what I could do; I might be inclined to click on that to see if I am eligible for further help. 
    * Request debt relief: Yeah I like the step by step and tells me what they need, the timeline,. I like how long it will take because you never know how much time you need to complete it. I like how it tells me the actual time it will take and it makes me to start here in green at the top and bottom the green makes me more optimistic. 
    * Talk to me about that experience of starting to make the payment (e.g., opening .gov, new sign-in, copying payment + account info)
    * After you’ve made a payment, what would you expect to see? When would you expect to see an update?
    * If this were to be built in real life, how likely would you be to use it? Maybe it is clean, informative and provides me everything about the payments I have make. I could see myself using it and comfortable seeing it on my phone and engaging with it. 
    * What if you don’t owe the debt: if I don’t owe it or its high: I would click request help and click dispute this debt and then I would start your debt dispute. 
    * Overall how have you been aware you could get help with debt: Google search or I haven’t maybe didn’t think it was worth the time to explore. Maybe just seeing the options here on this screen on the phone. It gives me a sense of knowing it is easier and I should have done this a while back. 
    * What them to lay out options: Yes. 
    * How to make a payment: Click on pay online. It gives the details and the tap on pay va.gov and then go to the other page to make the payment. 
    * Seen this before: Yes
    * Tap on blue green button, thoughts on the information: when I make a payment it is attached the that debt. It is clear. 
    * How would your process be if you made a payment on the phone: My process would be that I would have my personal information on my iPhone in the notes app so I would use that. It would ask be for a reference could. Yeah I think it would be the same. Anything I would need I would put in my Notes app. 
    * Experience of multiple apps: I think maybe before making a payment I was hoping it would already be tied to the information and maybe I would just need to confirm my bank and make a payment. It would have been seamless but if I have to copy all of it, I am comfortable with the process now. 
* Use app as us: Yeah I would use it. I am on the official gov page so I am confident that they are receiving my payment. If there was an error on the app my payment wouldn’t be on limbo, I like it on the gov page. I would still prefer the payment on the app but if that’s not possible I am fine with it on the gov site still. 

Which app do you prefer: the second app is preferred. I like the option where I can resolve debt, maybe because I  can work off the debt and comfort of them looking out for me. 

Labels: I like how it is in bold to remind me, the colors are simple and plain, I am being bombarded. It is clean, I like the resolve debt options. I would like it on the other debts as well. Its nice and clean. 

Thoughts on how it compares to va.gov website: Yeah, I think about it here and then my laptop. Here is straight to the point. Having it on my phone it is aesthetically pleasing. On my laptop I could be distracting and have too much information on one page. Here it just gives just the right information and not to much information. 

Copays page: I like here it tells me to contact the department of trust and has the number  and has the copay bills for the past 6 months because I know the amount I owe is UpToDate. 

First bill: It is standard, I like the option to pay bill here and the actual statement there. This is straightforward. I like this option. 

What would you be looking for instatements: I would look for the service I got and why I owe it as a reminder for myself. 

Open statement: No I think it would just be that because I would still pay it on time. I would just look at it to know the context of the bill. 

Walk me through how you would make a payment: I would go to Pay.gov and go from there. 

Thoughts on how you get the account number here: I think here I would check my notes app if I have it or if the information I have is what they are asking for or just to be on the safe side I would take where to find my VA account number to be on the safe side. 

Notes app how is it there: I  copy and past it there so I have it for the future. I would copy that account number right there into my notes app but I would still tap how to find how to find it just to trip check to make sure there weren’t any errors to make sure I am entering the correct information. 

Thoughts on copy button: I think I would copy but I imagine on the other page there are 5 separate lines I don’t know if they want it in different lines I would be doing a lot of pasting and deleting. 

Final thoughts: No I think everything is a unique design and unique comfort around it. I really like it



    * How would the likelihood of you using this compare to the previous version where you were not able to make payments?
* Now that we’ve gone through this section, do you have any other thoughts about what is here and how the information is presented? 
* What are your thoughts on how the sections and pages are labeled?
    * Are there other titles that would make more sense to you?
* *(if relevant)* Can you tell me what you think of this experience vs what you have found on va.gov?

Copayments: time-dependent and if relevant



* 

Those are all my questions. I’m going to check in with my team to see if anyone has any questions. If anyone would like to ask anything, you can unmute yourself and ask now.

Is there anything else you would like to share regarding managing finances that you haven’t yet shared?

**Consent to use video clips**



* I want to check once again that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners with your identifying information removed.
* Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?

**Thank-You and Closing**
