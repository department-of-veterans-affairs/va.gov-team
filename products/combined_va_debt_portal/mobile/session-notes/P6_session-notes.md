Start recording.



* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? Yes
* Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you? Yes

**Discussion**

Could you tell me a bit about yourself as a Veteran: what branch of the military did you serve, and when did you retire or separate? Um I am an [redacted], served ten years, left as a [redacted], Left in 2011. I settled in [redacted], I was a recruiter and separated here and stayed here. 

How have you been involved with the VA ‚Äì both in the past and now? Decent experience. I go to the va for my healthcare, more recently. I have also came out of homelessness so I used different programs for housing vouchers and case managers to get back to where I was before. 



* Have you been in any of their facilities? 
* Have you used the website and/or app? For what purpose(s)?  Um the mobile app and website is good; the website is more so pretty decent I use it for things like GI bill for school. I used it for healthcare, communicating with providers, ordering prescriptions. Same thing with the same. As  far as the app, I think it could grow more, have more features to make it more usable on the go. The website is pretty good. The app is decent enough but could be better. 
* What do you typically do on the app apposed to the website: for when I am trying to set an appointment or refilling prescriptions, sending messages to providers. That‚Äôs about it. 
* Why do you like the app instead of the website: it is quicker and easier to navigate. It is right there and quicker to get to. 
* What could be in the app that aren‚Äôt there: I would say things like if education piece like the GI bill, if you want to submit disability claims you can do it for that instead of online, if you want updates on the status of the claims, just more added rather than just medical. 

Now we're going to move to the financial portion of our discussion. I want to make sure that you‚Äôre only sharing what you‚Äôre willing ‚Äì I have no additional information about you or your finances with the VA.

**Cohort 1 - Overpayments ‚úÇÔ∏è ‚úÇÔ∏è ‚úÇÔ∏è ‚úÇÔ∏è**



* *Overview of their financial obligations*
    * (VBA debts) Have you had experience with owing the VA money? If you‚Äôre comfortable, could you tell me about that experience?   Yes I do. I had an overpayment for my GI Bill for courses I took. I dropped it early and owed the VA early for the portion I dropped. 
        * What was the situation?
        * When and how were you notified of the debt? I think I may have received a letter in the mail. There was a line in the letter I could repay the debt flat out or there was a payment option and I think there was a way to dispute the debt. 
        * How long did it take you to pay it off? Or do you have a rough idea when you‚Äôll pay it off? 
    * (copays) Do you have any experience with medical copayments through the VA? 
        * Do you receive any of these bills? If so, how? 
        * How long have you been receiving them? 
        * How often do you receive them? 

 \




* *Notifications/awareness*
    * (VBA debts) Tell me how you know you need to make a payment.
        * Tell me what prompts you to make a payment: At the time I didn‚Äôt have the funds to pay the debt so I let it be what it was so I wasn‚Äôt my concern. 
        * How well did they communicate everything: The letter and how it could be resolved was clear and laid out. Later down the line on the website I ran into it on accident and the website explains it the same way. They clearly explain the debt and how to resolve it. 
        * What is your thought on the communication regarding what needs to be paid?
        * How are you paying the debts? (payment method, benefit reduction, how often, mobile/web)
        * Is there anything that could make things easier for you? I don‚Äôt know, maybe before the debt like that happens, some form of explanation, if you drop a class in this point of time this is what you would owe. 
        * How you would want to receive that notification: Electronically, most communication is that way instead of paper. Paper mail is typically junk mail so I will just my email before paper mail because paper mail is typically junk mail. I try to select electronic mail instead but its not always an option. 
    * *(if relevant)*¬†(copays) Tell me how you learn that you have a bill.: yes but most recently. I wasn‚Äôt aware I could use the va. I had my own insurance through my employer. I started receiving paper mail I had to pay a copay and I wasn‚Äôt aware and at the time I didn‚Äôt have income and so then when they said I had copays and they said there‚Äôs ways.

        Once I had the letter it told me about the copay bill and it told me like the other letter how to take care of the copay debt and gave me the options if I had financial debt. They were going by my previous years income and didn‚Äôt have updated financial information*. *So I had to sent in updated financial information and that way I could clear the debt so I would be require to pay the copay

        * Is there anything that could make things easier for you? I guess it was laid out and everything. Its one of those things you don‚Äôt know until you know you have one. if you know ahead of time like when you visit the va. If you know ahead of time when you go to the VA, I had been before so there was something that could have been explained ahead of time when you start using the hospital system would have been helpful

Copay options to pay: similar to resolve, pay the bills, make payments, dispute. The other thing about financial situations from what they went off of verses what my actual finances were at the time.

How did you know they had outdated information: I think it came after the copay letters once I put different pieces togethers I realized they were going off of what I was going off of what I was making the year prior and I thought they were going off of the wrong information then I needed to dig more to find out I could submit updated information. 

Was that over the phone: that was through the website. Just piecing different things together. When it was telling me from the letter I could dispute the debt I learned they go off of financial information so I learned that you can update the information through another part of the website and by updating it I can dispute it better because my finances would be updated if that makes sense. 

Is that something you would want to do in the app: That would be beneficial because hopefully it would have been tied into the payments side so that you know ahead of time that it is tied together and it all goes together as one piece and they determine the copayments s on your income. That way I don‚Äôt have to go searching for it myself and its laid out together.  \




* *(if they have both)*
    * Consider both the copayment bills and the overpayment debts: in your mind, do these feel like different types of financial issues to you? Or do they belong in the same category?

**Prototype & Usability**

I'm going to be showing you a prototype of the mobile app, with some new features that we're testing out before we consider building them.

*(request they share screen)*

Please open up the Figma app, and I‚Äôll be walking you through how to sign in.



* *(share test credentials with them)*
* *(after logging in, send them¬†[prototype link](https://www.figma.com/proto/kRA7JHbthNrSLxTQHrzH8T/MFS---Overpayments---Copays-%7C-VA-Mobile?page-id=2001%3A429&node-id=7274-61308&p=f&viewport=24600%2C-1348%2C0.59&t=RzEWQo0ZfxtjJRxF-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=7274%3A61308&show-proto-sidebar=1)¬†over Zoom chat)*

From home screen



* You're on the home screen of our pretend mobile app.:
* Don‚Äôt yet click on anything: show me where to find what money you currently owe: I would say the bottom right where it says payments. 
    * How clear was that to find? 
    * Tell me your thoughts on the title of that section.: I mean payments works but maybe something different because it is geared towards overpayments or something towards that. I am not sure. 
        * What would you expect to find there? 
        * Are there other names that would be a better description or make things easier to find? 
* Now click into that tab
    * What are your thoughts on the info presented here? Now that I see it this way it makes more sense why it says payments. It is payments to a person and something they may owe to the VA. It makes more sense now. 
    * What would‚Äôve make it easier before: I don‚Äôt know maybe instead of payments something like Financials instead of payments. 
    * Now that you see what‚Äôs in this section: any further thoughts on the name ‚Äúpayments‚Äù? 
    * Regarding the info below the word "overpayments" ‚Äì what would be the most helpful to see there? 

Overpayment benefits debt

    * Tell me about the Debt Letter section ‚Äì what do you assume this is and how useful is it?

    * Here or anywhere else?
* Now we‚Äôre going to pretend that you don‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre going to have the money to make a payment on the debt in the next few months. Walk me through what you would do in this situation.
    * What sort of info or guidance might you look for?
    * Is it clear when you would need to start anything?
    * What are your thoughts on opening new windows for the information?
* Were you aware of these options for financial help? If so, how did you learn?

*(with payment option)*¬†‚úÖ üíµ ‚úÖ



* Now I'm going to have you¬†[open another prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/kRA7JHbthNrSLxTQHrzH8T/MFS---Overpayments---Copays-%7C-VA-Mobile?page-id=2001%3A429&node-id=7372-28070&p=f&viewport=24600%2C-1348%2C0.59&t=RzEWQo0ZfxtjJRxF-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=7372%3A28070&show-proto-sidebar=1)¬†to view a different version.
    * If you are ready to make a payment on this debt, walk me through how you would do that.
    * Talk to me about that experience of starting to make the payment (e.g. opening .gov, new sign-in, copying payment + account info)
    * After you‚Äôve made a payment, what would you expect to see? When would you expect to see an update?
    * If this were to be built in real life, how likely would you be to use it?
    * How would the likelihood of you using this compare to the previous version where you were not able to make payments?
* Now that we‚Äôve gone through this section, do you have any other thoughts about what is here and how the information is presented?
* What are your thoughts on how the sections and pages are labeled?
    * Are there other titles that would make more sense to you?
* *(if relevant)*¬†Can you tell me what you think of this experience vs what you have found on va.gov?

Copayments: time-dependent and if relevant



* 

Those are all my questions. I‚Äôm going to check in with my team to see if anyone has any questions. If anyone would like to ask anything, you can unmute yourself and ask now.

Is there anything else you would like to share regarding managing finances that you haven‚Äôt yet shared?

**Consent to use video clips**



* I want to check once again that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners with your identifying information removed.
* Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?
