Start recording.



* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? Yupp that‚Äôs fine
* Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?   Yes

**Discussion**

Could you tell me a bit about yourself as a Veteran: what branch of the military did you serve, and when did you retire or separate?  I was [redacted] from 2003 to 2015 to [redacted]. Got out for a few years then in 2019 went into the [redacted] reserves. 

How have you been involved with the VA ‚Äì both in the past and now? For VA health care, I applied when I got out because of the [redacted] experience so I have had it for 9 years now and that‚Äôs how I get the health care and I have used the GI bill. 



* Have you been in any of their facilities?
* Have you used the website and/or app? For what purpose(s)? I use the mobile app. I work on ships so I use the messaging and digital records. Otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt be able to talk to the doctors or be able to set anything up. I don‚Äôt use the app because I don‚Äôt have   cell service out at sea. 

Now we're going to move to the financial portion of our discussion. I want to make sure that you‚Äôre only sharing what you‚Äôre willing ‚Äì I have no additional information about you or your finances with the VA.

**Cohort 2 - Copays ‚úÇÔ∏è ‚úÇÔ∏è ‚úÇÔ∏è ‚úÇÔ∏è**



* *Overview of their financial obligations*
    * What is your experience with medical copayments through the VA?  That has been messy, it‚Äôll be really nice when it is digital. When I get it, it is past due and it is frust3erating. It is small but frustrating because I was traveling and had to go to urgent care. I when through the hoops and when you have a medical emergency and was on the phone for hours and they didn‚Äôt pay for hours. Then went through months of sending letters. I had [redacted] while on active because I have to do screenings each years. I have an [redacted] and one year it failed and I was referred out and it showed up as doing it twice once in 1 year so I got a 6k bill and it took along time to get it fixed. It took forever and I had to use a satellite phone to get it fixed. Copays it‚Äôs a copay in the mail, it could be months before I get a bill, I had a [redacted] and it could be months before I get a bill and when I get it, it is already past due so I make calls to see how much I owe. I cant figure it out, sometimes I don‚Äôt get charges and sometimes I do. So it is complicated. It is past due and going to pay late fees, it is a level of frustration I wish I didn‚Äôt have to deal with
    * Something other than letters: just because in the past there‚Äôs a copay for meds or a visit, I don‚Äôt want it to go to collections or be past do I will call. It is extremely complicated there‚Äôs no way to easily way to look up a bill
    * How could it be easy: it is already digital just put it digitally. Everything have it connected to pay.gov and have it there to get a push notification or email to go look at your bill. That would be fantastic. 
    * Do you use pay.gov or call: I make it through pay.gov unless I don‚Äôt have the information to use pay.gov
        * Do you receive any of these bills? If so, how?
        * How long have you been receiving them?
        * How often do you receive them?
    * (VBA debts) Have you had any debts as a result of a benefit overpayment? I got a notice that I owe them money that I had to may them but it was forgiven. By the time I got it was forgiven. 
        * What was the situation?
        * When and how were you notified of the debt? It was by mail. It might have been two letters but I learned about it all at the same time because mail is very slow. 
        * How long did it take you to pay it off? Or do you have a rough idea when you‚Äôll pay it off?

 \




* *Notifications/awareness*
    * (copays) Tell me how you learn that you have a bill.
        * Tell me what prompts you to make a payment
        * What is your thought on how the bills are presented to you?
        * How are you paying the bills? (mobile/web, how often, payment method)
        * Is there anything that could make things easier for you?
    * *(if relevant)*¬†(VBA debts) Tell me how you know you need to make a payment.
        * Tell me what prompts you to make a payment
        * What is your thought on the communication regarding what needs to be paid?
        * How are you paying the debts? (payment method, benefit reduction, how often, mobile/web)
        * Is there anything that could make things easier for you?

 \




* *(if they have both)*
    * Consider both the copayment bills and the overpayment debts: in your mind, do these feel like different types of financial issues to you? Or do they belong in the same category?

**Prototype & Usability**

I'm going to be showing you a prototype of the mobile app, with some new features that we're testing out before we consider building them.

*(request they share screen)*

Please open up the Figma app, and I‚Äôll be walking you through how to sign in.



* *(share test credentials with them)*
* *(after logging in, send them¬†[prototype link](https://www.figma.com/proto/kRA7JHbthNrSLxTQHrzH8T/MFS---Overpayments---Copays-%7C-VA-Mobile?page-id=2001%3A429&node-id=7274-61308&p=f&viewport=24600%2C-1348%2C0.59&t=RzEWQo0ZfxtjJRxF-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=7274%3A61308&show-proto-sidebar=1)¬†over Zoom chat)*

From home screen



* You're on the home screen of our pretend mobile app.
* Don‚Äôt yet click on anything: show me where to find what money you currently owe: I might go to health. I might try payments. It is confusing because I would expect something to say bills, it is like a benefits like a va loan. Its not a claim or appointment or a message or rating. To me a payment is like a disability payment from the va. Its not something that jumps out. I would want it to say bills. 
    * How clear was that to find?
    * Tell me your thoughts on the title of that section.
        * What would you expect to find there?
        * Are there other names that would be a better description or make things easier to find?
* Now click into that tab
    * What are your thoughts on the info presented here?  Make it clear that it is for healthcare because I used GI bill for a month. I am not eligible for the other stuff or I haven‚Äôt used it. Having a heading like healthcare. Like GI Bill, Va Loan, Healthcare. 
    * Now that you see what‚Äôs in this section: any further thoughts on the name ‚Äúpayments‚Äù?    Yeah maybe if they combined maybes that I send and what they send to me maybe financial. 
    * Regarding the info below the word "copay" ‚Äì what would be the most helpful to see there? I would want to know when it is due. I just want to know how long I have until I have to pay it. 

Copayments

*(no payment option)*¬†‚ùå üíµ ‚ùå



* Find what you currently owe for copayments
    * How clear was that to find? Yeah this makes sense, I assume which I use review details it will tell me the copayment will be and what the service is. I need a place where I can get a pdf copy of the bill because I have HAS so I can get it reimbursed. I need to submit the va.gov receipt but I need the copy of the bill, there needs to be a clear way to download it. I work for the federal union so I have to upload it so it is similar for others that work for them as well so there‚Äôs a portal. 
    * Could you do it form the app: I honestly don‚Äôt know because I don‚Äôt do much form the phone because I am at sea a lot. I know I can login form my phone; I have to login with my CAC reader for that‚Äôs why I do everything on my computer. 
    * What can you tell me about the other copayments on this screen? That statement is good; I would get the pdf and email it to myself and access it from the computer. I assume this top link is where I can pay it online and I assume each charge I can get more information how much the actual charge was, and how much each one was written off. 
    * Charge details: it seems very vague, I am used to seeing a total amount, the copay, specific to what actually happened. What the service is the billing code. 
    * How to pay: I would want a way to auto pay, I could go to pay.gov and enter the account number but I don‚Äôt think the average person would remember that. 
* After you have a medical appointment, when would you expect to see the copayment appear here?
    * How would you expect to be notified?
* What do you need to know for each copay due?
    * How easy/difficult is it to find relevant information?
* Are you usually visiting different VA locations for your healthcare?
    * How clearly is everything presented here? (do they know the copays from locations are grouped?)
* *[point to a specific copay]*¬†What can you tell me about your activity here?
    * Is it clear when the payment is due?
* If you pay off a copay, would you want to see it?
    * Here or anywhere else?
    * Are there any here that you believe are paid off? How clear is it?
* Let‚Äôs pretend you see an error ‚Äì¬†*[point to a specific copay]*¬†one of the copays is for an appointment that you did not have. What would you do? Request help but for me I think that would be me not being about to pay my bill. Honestly at this point I would just call the va but its not listed here which is frustrating so I might tap here. Again it seems a bit to complicated. If I have a problem I should be able to click dispute and then it should be like do you want to chat or call . There‚Äôs too much to navigate to the help needed for each charge. There should only be a few buttons , pay bill, dispute, request help/payment plan. 
    * What sort of info or guidance might you look for?
* Now we‚Äôre going to pretend that you don‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre going to have the money to pay the most recent copay bills. Walk me through what you would do in this situation.
    * What sort of info or guidance might you look for?
    * Is it clear when you would have to start something?
    * What are your thoughts on opening new windows for the information?
* Were you aware of these options for financial help? If so, how did you learn? Vaguely, its not something that has been a concern of mine except when I got the [redacted] bill that I wasn‚Äôt supposed to get.VA healthcare is affordable. Theres homeless veterans and low-income seniors so I can see it being difficult for others. I can‚Äôt remember how I learned. 
* What else would you want to do here with regards to your copays?
    * How would you expect to make payments?
    * What are your thoughts on this new section not having a payment option?
    * If this were to be built in real life, how likely would you be to use it? I mean I might look it up to see what I owe since I don‚Äôt know a way to use it on the website and how to get the billing statement or if I was curious if something was bills. I would use this because there‚Äôs no way to do this. I would prefer if it was on the website. 
    * Older statements, where: Where it says PDF statements
    * How easy to find: I would just change it to say previous or older statements, I am used to seeing it on banking statements. 

*(with payment option)*¬†‚úÖ üíµ ‚úÖ



* Now I'm going to have you¬†[open another prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/kRA7JHbthNrSLxTQHrzH8T/MFS---Overpayments---Copays-%7C-VA-Mobile?page-id=2001%3A429&node-id=7372-28070&p=f&viewport=24600%2C-1348%2C0.59&t=RzEWQo0ZfxtjJRxF-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=7372%3A28070&show-proto-sidebar=1)¬†to view a different version.¬†*(with payment option)*

When you go to pay.gov you have to enter them individually so I don‚Äôt know if it is helpful to copy because you cant paste it all into one box. I like that you can hit pay bill. 



    * If you are ready to make a payment on this bill, walk me through how you would do that.: Go to pay bill and pay on pay.gov.  I would wish this would be prefilled because why should I have to reenter all of this. If I entered my account number it should populate because I am always worried what if I entered it incorrectly. I find it annoying that the payment information when you pay your credit card information, credit card balance, amount due or other, I pay off the most recent bill, then there‚Äôs other charges, I just want to pay it all at once. It‚Äôs a pain in the ass to go in multiple times, I just want to it is all at once. We are in a digital age, it would be nice to just pay in the app. If we are paying the bill the other option in the phone does it take you to a phone tree and hope to God that you reach someone before you die. If I pay by phone I would want to immediately connect, not just be on hold. That is really unhelpful, it should really just be 1 touch, I should just be connected to the right person to pay my bill and know the estimated hold time. 
    * Talk to me about that experience of starting to make the payment (e.g. opening .gov, new sign-in, copying payment + account info)
    * After you‚Äôve paid this bill, what would you expect to see? When would you expect to see an update?
    * If this were to be built in real life, how likely would you be to use it? Um. Yeah again because I have to enter it all by hand it is faster when I have a keyboard instead of on the phone. The value of the phone and apps is that the should be interconnects and not typing much. I don‚Äôt know if I would be doing that. 
    * How would the likelihood of you using this compare to the previous version where you were not able to make payments? I mean this one definitely has more useful features. This one is an improvement. 
* *(if user has not brought them up already)*¬†Talk to me about your monthly statements for copays
    * Were you aware of them?
    * Do you read them now? If so, what purpose do they serve? What are you doing with them?
    * Walk me through exploring them in the prototype here.
    * What are your thoughts on the PDFs here?
* Now that we‚Äôve gone through this section, any other thoughts you‚Äôd like to share on what is here and how the information is presented?
* What are your thoughts on how the sections and pages are labeled? Um. I think this part where it says pay or request help is useless. If I click down on the arrow. It says you have to pay or request help it isn‚Äôt adding value. I would expect it to have a button to pay or request help. It is just repeating what it is saying above. If I am going to open it up I want a button to click to help to pay or a payment plan. 
* Website information there: I have done, maybe in changed in a few months. As of 3 months ago I would search and could not find and found out it‚Äôs a future capability. 
* 
    * Are there other titles that would make more sense to you?
* *(if relevant)*¬†Can you tell me what you think of this experience vs what you have found on va.gov?

Overpayments: time-dependent and if relevant

Thoughts: This one here where it says disability compensation and they are reducing you benefits until it is paid. They should state how much they are taking and expect it to be paid off by this date. The government screws up my pay a lot. They take my pay from check to fix it each time and let me know how much out of each check. That is important for people to know especially those who have low incomes because they need to know how much and for how long. 

What would be helpful: I would want to know where this debt came from, it has why might I have this debt. It seems generic. I would want to know exactly why it came to be which I assume is in the letters. I want to know how they calculated it. You could get overpayments if you didn‚Äôt take enough classes on term. Maybe I actually owe the money but more often than not there‚Äôs a communication issue. I would want to know if it is accurate or not. 

Where would you find it: the why might I have this debt is useless. I just what to know why I have the debt and how to prevent it in the future if it was the timing of class to avoid it. 

If you don‚Äôt owe it: It says resolve debt I don‚Äôt know what that means, it seems like paying it. It should say dispute it. I would look for dispute it. 

What if you cant pay it: This says you can request help but there‚Äôs these it tells you can request but haha were aren‚Äôt gonna tell you how

What about how to make a payment: I would go to resolve then pay online. I would break it down here. Have it make payment, dispute, request financial assistance. Request help is vague because it could be like grant/forgive/cant pay. 

What this broke down on that page: yes or at least a link to break it down. My other thought is the government is lumbering. Request a payment pay here‚Äôs 6milion ways to talk to someone. It should just be like here lets start. To dispute let‚Äôs just start. If I say I want to start something it should just take me right there, there‚Äôs to many steps. 

Paying bill: Again it should be prefill or in the app. It is a pain in the ass to go back and forth. God bless the government it is just to complicated. The way to fix the government isn‚Äôt to fire everyone it is to streamline the operations. 

Information here that would be entered in the payment site: yeah I don‚Äôt know. I am trying to think of a way that would let me screenshot it or maybe just say like may it clear that the form does not prefill so you will need to write it down or toggle back and forth. It says you need to provide the details but I am not grasping that I need to write it down or toggle. Its not even a mobile-enabled site. 

Any other thoughts: Where it says pay online: it would be useful to have pay online to have the options like credit cards, ACH. That way the method you thought you were going to use is accepted. It should be obvious so that you have your information ready before you go down a rabbit hole. If you plan to use a credit card and then the page says no credit card then you have to decide to write a check, if you plan to pay using one method then you can‚Äôt then you aren‚Äôt ready to pay. I don‚Äôt know, it says person entitled. To me that is confusing I would say beneficiary. The person who is the account holder. Unless that‚Äôs the title of the box I will fill in over there. 

Those are all my questions. I‚Äôm going to check in with my team to see if anyone has any questions. If anyone would like to ask anything, you can unmute yourself and ask now.

Is there anything else you would like to share regarding managing finances that you haven‚Äôt yet shared?

**Consent to use video clips**



* I want to check once again that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners with your identifying information removed.
* Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?

**Thank-You and Closing**

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the digital experience and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again and enjoy the rest of your day!
