Start recording.



* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? That‚Äôs fine.
* Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you? That‚Äôs fine. 

**Discussion**

Could you tell me a bit about yourself as a Veteran: what branch of the military did you serve, and when did you retire or separate? I served in the [redacted] from 2006-2010. Then I went to college, and now I work for the [redacted]. I am on the tech side of things basically. 

How have you been involved with the VA ‚Äì both in the past and now?

I had a couple surgeries from the VA. Medications, mental health, but they source it out. 



* Have you been in any of their facilities?
* Have you used the website and/or app? For what purpose(s)? I used to use just the website; I didn‚Äôt like clogging my phone. But lately in the past year or so I‚Äôve done a number of these with Perigean. Now I have started using it a little more. Most of the time I am on my computer, and I usually use the website. But if I am not by my computer, I will use the app. I will use if for mobility. 

Now we're going to move to the financial portion of our discussion. I want to make sure that you‚Äôre only sharing what you‚Äôre willing ‚Äì I have no additional information about you or your finances with the VA.

I have gotten a bill and called them and told them hey, it‚Äôs supposed to be free. I also had a copay for a prescription, but I don‚Äôt take it anymore. I received a mail in letter. There was one more letter asking me if I use the VA. I use my regular doctor I don‚Äôt know how we‚Äôd go through the VA. 

It sounds like you haven‚Äôt paid any of these copays. Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong? I paid the medication copay.

What prompted you to make those payments? I got a letter through the mail. 

What could have been done to make it easier for you to know about these copays? An email. I will take the time to sit down and go through my email. I have all notifications on my phone turned off, because I get so much and it is so distracting. Physical mail would be good, but it can get lost. I have never gotten an email.

How do you pay for these copays? Usually, I will call the number on the bill and pay it that way. 

**Cohort 2 - Copays ‚úÇÔ∏è ‚úÇÔ∏è ‚úÇÔ∏è ‚úÇÔ∏è**

 \




* *(if they have both)*
    * Consider both the copayment bills and the overpayment debts: in your mind, do these feel like different types of financial issues to you? Or do they belong in the same category?

**Prototype & Usability**

I'm going to be showing you a prototype of the mobile app, with some new features that we're testing out before we consider building them.

*(request they share screen)*

Please open up the Figma app, and I‚Äôll be walking you through how to sign in.



* *(share test credentials with them)*
* *(after logging in, send them¬†[prototype link](https://www.figma.com/proto/kRA7JHbthNrSLxTQHrzH8T/MFS---Overpayments---Copays-%7C-VA-Mobile?page-id=2001%3A429&node-id=7274-61308&p=f&viewport=24600%2C-1348%2C0.59&t=RzEWQo0ZfxtjJRxF-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=7274%3A61308&show-proto-sidebar=1)¬†over Zoom chat)*

From home screen



* You're on the home screen of our pretend mobile app.
* Don‚Äôt yet click on anything: show me where to find what money you currently owe
* Where would you expect to find these copays?

    Payments. 


    Would anything be more clear in the title? No it says payments. It says overpayment debts. Does that mean the VA over paid you and you have to pay it back? (Yes)

    * How clear was that to find? That was very clear without, you know as soon as I logged in here that‚Äôs the first thing that came to mind under payments. That is where you would expect it to be. That‚Äôs very clear there. 
    * Tell me your thoughts on the title of that section.
        * What would you expect to find there?
        * Are there other names that would be a better description or make things easier to find?
* Now click into that tab
    * What are your thoughts on the info presented here? Maybe not necessary, no that‚Äôs right I was thinking something else. I would say that‚Äôs fine right there. It‚Äôs clearly says like what you need to pay at the bottom. If I click on one of these, will it show me what they are for. Okay no, that looks good like these two are bundled together. This looks good you have the copays and the overpayment separated. 
    * Now that you see what‚Äôs in this section: any further thoughts on the name ‚Äúpayments‚Äù?
    * Regarding the info below the word "copay" ‚Äì what would be the most helpful to see there?

Copayments

*(no payment option)*¬†‚ùå üíµ ‚ùå



* Find what you currently owe for copayments

    For the middle one I see it shows the top and the bottom says when you paid it and when it is due. I wonder why the middle one doesn‚Äôt say that. I would like to see exactly when I need to pay it by. I am one of those people that procrastinate, I would like to know when it was due. I would say the one on the bottom shouldn‚Äôt be here because it is paid off. It should be somewhere under history. I would think that when I click on payments these would be the ones that are outstanding. When I click back here I can see history that is where that one should go. 


    Clicking on the first one it tells me what I owe and when I need to pay it by. Clicking on it this one has a breakdown of everything. What is this at the bottom This tells me since it‚Äôs $50 I have to pay the first 4 that is the breakdown of the $50. But this is what you have paid for already. Let‚Äôs just say these are all for a service for my right knee. I see past payment as well as what I owe. I would say over here, I would just put what I owed for now. I would separate the balance from the payments already received. So that it‚Äôs clear what the exact balance is. They are grouped into one. Or have the breakdown of $50, and then if you wanted to know more you could go to the statements or the payment history. 


    So, it‚Äôs not really clear what the $50 is from exactly? Yeah, you now these 1,2,3,4 right here are the break down of the $50, but then these here are not part of it. 

    * How clear was that to find?
    * What can you tell me about the other copayments on this screen?
* After you have a medical appointment, when would you expect to see the copayment appear here?
    * How would you expect to be notified?
* What do you need to know for each copay due?
    * How easy/difficult is it to find relevant information?
* Are you usually visiting different VA locations for your healthcare?
    * How clearly is everything presented here? (do they know the copays from locations are grouped?)
* *[point to a specific copay]*¬†What can you tell me about your activity here?
    * Is it clear when the payment is due?
* If you pay off a copay, would you want to see it?
    * Here or anywhere else?
    * Are there any here that you believe are paid off? How clear is it?
* Let‚Äôs pretend you see an error ‚Äì¬†*[point to a specific copay]*¬†one of the copays is for an appointment that you did not have. What would you do? 

    So, let‚Äôs say for outpatient care for optometry, if I didn‚Äôt attend this one I would click on it and see if there is more information. I would like to confirm with the provider that I didn‚Äôt got to the outpatient for eye care that day. 


    Clicking on the active link. This would be helpful. There should be contact information, so that I could contact them or the VA. 


    Where would you go to find contact information? I would click on the help button. Go ahead and click on that and see what happens. Okay so you have the number on here about the copay bill. That‚Äôs the first thing I would do. But is this the general number for the VA or the number for this bill. 


    What would make it clear about the number that you are actually seeing? So this tells me that it‚Äôs more of a general number. It would be fine as long as it relates to the actual services I received and not just a general VA number. It happened to me one time where I was put on hold to transfer, and then another transfer again. Someone that could help me right away in stead of being transferred. 

    * What sort of info or guidance might you look for?
* Now we‚Äôre going to pretend that you don‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre going to have the money to pay the most recent copay bills. Walk me through what you would do in this situation.

    I would call the number under help, and see if they have a payment plan. Or what would be more helpful, because you know some people don‚Äôt like that interaction. A link here to set up a payment plan would help. 


    Okay, where would you like to find information regarding a payment plan? 


    I would say under payments, under pay bill. When this here you are trying to pay a bill, it doesn‚Äôt go to the app? I paid by phone, so I don‚Äôt know what this is. I would click here and see if there was an option for payment plan. 


    Tap on the help and see if there is anything there that can help you with a payment. Oh okay, how to request debt relief. I would think this is the one that would help me see if there is a payment plan. 


    Can you think of anything that would make it clearer, for debt relief? We are talking about a payment plan, and a debt relief is mor like trying to ask if there is a way to waive your co-pay or debt. I think they are different. I would say you could put it under here, if you have questions or want to do a payment plan. Or you could put another drop down about a payment plan. But if you didn‚Äôt want to clog it up with a lot of drop downs you could put it here. 

    * What sort of info or guidance might you look for?
    * Is it clear when you would have to start something?
    * What are your thoughts on opening new windows for the information?
* Were you aware of these options for financial help? If so, how did you learn? No, I did not know about debt relief from the VA. If you owe money, but then again some people have different situations in life and might need it. 
* What else would you want to do here with regards to your copays?

    Just what I mentioned here about having copay separated from previous payments. It has nothing to do with what I need to pay and do right now. I see the PDF statement here at the bottom so that‚Äôs good.


    Are PDF statements something you use right now? When I want to audit everything, I would use it to see what I paid and I owed. 


    Open up this statement. How would you use the statement here? It says right here all of my charges are the same thing as the previous page. It doesn‚Äôt have your previous or I guess statement balance just for the month. That‚Äôs what I would expect. 


    Would you do anything beyond viewing the statement? No I would look at the charges and what I need to pay. I would audit it. 

    * How would you expect to make payments?
    * What are your thoughts on this new section not having a payment option?
    * If this were to be built in real life, how likely would you be to use it?

How likely do you think you would  use this whole thing we have been looking at here? I would use it, if it was usable. Right now I would say it‚Äôs usable as it is. The PDF is very minimal it may not be needed. For me it would be very rare to have a lot of information there on a PDF statement. I would have everything on a page like this but separate what you need to pay from what was already paid. It would be easier if you were paying on the app. 

Would you still use this knowing there is no option to pay on the app? Yes, it would be easier then calling on the phone. 

*(with payment option)*¬†‚úÖ üíµ ‚úÖ



* Now I'm going to have you¬†[open another prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/kRA7JHbthNrSLxTQHrzH8T/MFS---Overpayments---Copays-%7C-VA-Mobile?page-id=2001%3A429&node-id=7372-28070&p=f&viewport=24600%2C-1348%2C0.59&t=RzEWQo0ZfxtjJRxF-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=7372%3A28070&show-proto-sidebar=1)¬†to view a different version.¬†*(with payment option)*
    * If you are ready to make a payment on this bill, walk me through how you would do that. I would click on pay bill. If there is a pay. I would pay on pay.gov instead of paying by phone or mail. I would never pay by mail. 

Clicking on pay.gov. Thoughts on finding the information you would need to make the payment. I would click on finding VA account number because I don‚Äôt know it on the top of my head. 

Going back to review details. Thoughts on this?

I would still use pay.gov. I see here the account number I would copy it and paste it. 

Anything else that would make that easier for you? 

I would say, going back to copays. Unless I‚Äôm already in review details, it‚Äôs there. But if I‚Äôm not and I want to pay it, it would be nice to have the information right there instead of having to click back into review it. 



    * Talk to me about that experience of starting to make the payment (e.g. opening .gov, new sign-in, copying payment + account info)
    * After you‚Äôve paid this bill, what would you expect to see? When would you expect to see an update?
    * If this were to be built in real life, how likely would you be to use it? I would rather use this version. I would avoid calling and being on hold, I could pay it online easy. The reason I pay it by phone is because it‚Äôs right there. 
    * How would the likelihood of you using this compare to the previous version where you were not able to make payments?
* *(if user has not brought them up already)*¬†Talk to me about your monthly statements for copays
    * Were you aware of them?
    * Do you read them now? If so, what purpose do they serve? What are you doing with them?
    * Walk me through exploring them in the prototype here.
    * What are your thoughts on the PDFs here?
* Now that we‚Äôve gone through this section, any other thoughts you‚Äôd like to share on what is here and how the information is presented?
* What are your thoughts on how the sections and pages are labeled?
    * Are there other titles that would make more sense to you?
* *(if relevant)*¬†Can you tell me what you think of this experience vs what you have found on va.gov?

Overpayments: time-dependent and if relevant

Those are all my questions. I‚Äôm going to check in with my team to see if anyone has any questions. If anyone would like to ask anything, you can unmute yourself and ask now.

Is there anything else you would like to share regarding managing finances that you haven‚Äôt yet shared?

**Consent to use video clips**



* I want to check once again that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners with your identifying information removed.
* Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?

**Thank-You and Closing**

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the digital experience and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
