# Summary from Dovetail

#### Debt notification and communication

The participant primarily receives debt notifications through physical mail, though they expressed a preference for also receiving email notifications for better tracking. [1]("Letters. I've always received a letter.")[2]("Not really. I mean, I guess the fact that I was only notified via ma. I guess that's one thing. Maybe if they sent me an email it'd be a little bit better.") Clear communication about payment deadlines and appeal timeframes was highlighted as important information to include in notifications. [3]("I know there's like a time frame of when some you get letters that you have like 90 days. I think it is before where you can appeal it.")

#### Payment process experience and challenges 

The current payment process requires switching between applications and manually recording information, creating friction in the user experience. [4]("Yeah, just switch back and forth. I'd probably write it down.") The participant noted challenges around keeping track of required payment information and suggested having copy functionality would improve the experience. [5]("maybe being able to copy doesn't let you trying to do like a copy and paste.")

#### Information accessibility and organization

The participant emphasized the importance of having detailed transaction information readily available, including specific months and reasons for charges. [6]("Which like for basically which month I got I'm being charged for... Or if it's like even when you go to like co payments, what off what appointment am I being charged that co payment for stuff like that") Having digital access to statements was seen as valuable for record-keeping and potential dispute purposes. [7]("Like I said, in case you have to dispute something or if there was an overcharge or anything like that.")[8]("So it's nicer than having a paper one... Keep track of. You're not going to throw it out so on accident.")


# Notes by Perigean. Conversation Guide used as the structure for notes.

Start recording.



* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? Yes
* Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you? Yeah

**Discussion**

Could you tell me a bit about yourself as a Veteran: what branch of the military did you serve, and when did you retire or separate? Brandon, I was in the Army from 09 to 13. I did three tours in Iraq. 

How have you been involved with the VA ‚Äì both in the past and now? I have used my GI bill and I have my disability compensation and medical. 



* Have you been in any of their facilities?
* Have you used the website and/or app? For what purpose(s)? I haven‚Äôt really used the app; I used it a few times. I used the site to get prescription and secure messaging to get refills. Its easier than calling. Then filling out for the Gi bill I did it through benefits but its through login.gov now. I go in once or twice a month for medical. 
* What made you stop suing the app: I rarely use my phone for internet so if I only use the site once or twice a month why would I use it on the phone. 

Now we're going to move to the financial portion of our discussion. I want to make sure that you‚Äôre only sharing what you‚Äôre willing ‚Äì I have no additional information about you or your finances with the VA.

* *Overview of their financial obligations*
    * (VBA debts) Have you had experience with owing the VA money? If you‚Äôre comfortable, could you tell me about that experience? Yeah serval times it has happened from overpayments on my GI bill. A check was early that‚Äôs the only times it happened and it got caught up I n the system and needed paid back. 
        * What was the situation?
        * When and how were you notified of the debt? I always received a letter. 
        * How long did it take you to pay it off? Or do you have a rough idea when you‚Äôll pay it off? I would have it come out of next months pay. 
        * How could it have been easier: Not really. I guess the fact It was only told by mail, I guess if they sent me an email it would‚Äôve been better. Snail mail works but a surprise of seeing it just disappeared. Besides sending me an email I don‚Äôt know what else they can do.

* *Notifications/awareness*
    * (VBA debts) Tell me how you know you need to make a payment.
        * Tell me what prompts you to make a payment
        * What is your thought on the communication regarding what needs to be paid?
        * How are you paying the debts? (payment method, benefit reduction, how often, mobile/web)
        * Is there anything that could make things easier for you?

**Prototype & Usability**

I'm going to be showing you a prototype of the mobile app, with some new features that we're testing out before we consider building them.

*(request they share screen)*

Please open up the Figma app, and I‚Äôll be walking you through how to sign in.



* *(share test credentials with them)*

From home screen



* You're on the home screen of our pretend mobile app.
* Don‚Äôt yet click on anything: show me where to find what money you currently owe: Maybe claims, bottoms under benefits or payments. I was thinking maybe under the see details. 
    * How clear was that to find? 
    * Tell me your thoughts on the title of that section.: 
        * What would you expect to find there?
        * Are there other names that would be a better description or make things easier to find?
* Now click into that tab
    * What are your thoughts on the info presented here? It looks clear and understandable. 
    * Now that you see what‚Äôs in this section: any further thoughts on the name ‚Äúpayments‚Äù? With it just saying payments it makes me think its what they sent me, it makes sense, I don‚Äôt have suggestions. Its something you just need to explore and tap around.
    * Regarding the info below the word "overpayments" ‚Äì what would be the most helpful to see there? Just telling what is due and how much is owe, the deadline of when it needs to be paid. I don‚Äôt know if VA does deadlines or not. It seems good and clear. 

Overpayment benefits debt

*(no payment option)*¬†‚ùå üíµ ‚ùå



* Find what you currently owe for overpayment debts:
    * How clear was that to find? Really clear because it says your current balance. It is really clear. 
    * What can you tell me about the other debts on this screen? I don‚Äôt know how you would add additional information. 
* If a new debt arises, how would you expect to be notified?
* What do you need to know for each debt?
    * How easy/difficult is it to find relevant information?
* [point to a specific debt] What can you tell me about your activity here?
    * Is it clear when a payment is due?
    * Tell me about the Debt Letter section ‚Äì what do you assume this is and how useful is it?
* If you pay off a debt, would you want to see it?
    * Here or anywhere else?
* Now we‚Äôre going to pretend that you don‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre going to have the money to make a payment on the debt in the next few months. Walk me through what you would do in this situation.
    * What sort of info or guidance might you look for? Here you have your due dates, balances, and transaction history. That‚Äôs good information. They have your letter history. That‚Äôs pretty thorough. It says for housing but it doesn‚Äôt say for what month, oh here I see why I might have this debt. Oh. To have the actual reason you are being charged would be helpful. 
    * Would you want additional information: Yeah, Basically I would want to know for what month I am being charged for, stuff like that is normally sent out in the letters they send to you. 
    * Letter history: there‚Äôs a time frame, you  have 90 days to appeal so knowing you have a time frame and knowing there‚Äôs a time frame and to know what date to go by. The date is the most important
    * How likely would you use it: I would use my computer because I am so use to using it. If I didn‚Äôt have a computer this would make it a lot easier. 
    * If you had a debt to may payments what would you want: when are they due, what happens if I miss a payment, if I can setup auto charge to my charge to make the payment. 
    * Thoughts on how likely you would use it not seeing it here: It would depend if I could do it online. 
* If you don‚Äôt owe the debt: It doesn‚Äôt tell me why I have to pay it, it would be nice to tell me why I have to pay it. It isn‚Äôt really clear here. 
* How could it be clear: having a dispute debt here instead of under request help.
* If you cant6 pay: other way to pay, oh pay by phone or mail. I don‚Äôt know what you can do other than call to contact them. Maybe if there was an option under resolve debt. Maybe request help with debt. 
* How to make this clear to get information for help: have debt help instead of request help because it seems like you are asking for help with the app not with the debt. 
* Were you aware of these options for financial help? If so, how did you learn? Dispute this debt is what we were talking about easier is clear and simple. Request with VA debt: request payment plan, there‚Äôs a form you need to fill out and it pre-fills it for you. That is helpful. 
* What else would you want to do here with regards to your debt?
    * How would you expect to make payments?
    * What are your thoughts on this new section not having a payment option?
    * If this were to be built in real life, how likely would you be to use it?

*(with payment option)*¬†‚úÖ üíµ ‚úÖ



* Now I'm going to have you¬†[open another prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/kRA7JHbthNrSLxTQHrzH8T/MFS---Overpayments---Copays-%7C-VA-Mobile?page-id=2001%3A429&node-id=7372-28070&p=f&viewport=24600%2C-1348%2C0.59&t=RzEWQo0ZfxtjJRxF-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=7372%3A28070&show-proto-sidebar=1)¬†to view a different version.
    * If you are ready to make a payment on this debt, walk me through how you would do that: resolve debt, pay online. It takes you to the va site so you cant pay on the app I guess. It is just taking me to the internet site, it would be nice to do it on the app. Now I would have to login to my .gov account. This would make it useless to even use the app. 
    * Thoughts on entering information for online payments: I have never done it before, I didn‚Äôt know you need all of this, it seems more complicated than it needs to be. You should just put in your card number but it is the government. 
    * How would you find the information: that‚Äôs another good point, that‚Äôs why the email being sent to you would be good because what if I threw out the letter. If I don‚Äôt have the letter I wouldn‚Äôt find it. 
    * Thoughts on information about required debt information: that is helpful because I wouldn‚Äôt need to go hunting for my letter because they have it right here
    * How could it be clear it is right here to use: I don‚Äôt know how to make it clearer than listing it out here
    * What about if you were going it on the phone: I could go on the app and get it from here. 
    * Switching between the apps: It is simple to switch between screens; you can‚Äôt make it simpler than that. 
    * Talk to me about that experience of starting to make the payment (e.g., opening .gov, new sign-in, copying payment + account info)
    * After you‚Äôve made a payment, what would you expect to see? When would you expect to see an update?
    * If this were to be built in real life, how likely would you be to use it? I might use it knowing I have to use it to get the pin, having the information right here makes it simpler. 
    * How would the likelihood of you using this compare to the previous version where you were not able to make payments? More likely where you can pay. 
* Now that we‚Äôve gone through this section, do you have any other thoughts about what is here and how the information is presented?
* What are your thoughts on how the sections and pages are labeled? I think it opens in a new window. Oh it doesn‚Äôt because we were kick out, maybe have it open in a different window instead of it opening in the same window. Its like you can‚Äôt switch back. Does this allow you to copy? It does so I guess I would write it down, I would write it all down first. Maybe if there is may this debt online have a note staying you will need this information to make your payment to write it down. Just a reminder that you will need the information before you leave the screen. It doesn‚Äôt say that it will kick the information away from you, so maybe just allow it to copy and paste. 
    * Are there other titles that would make more sense to you? No this is good.
* *(if relevant)*¬†Can you tell me what you think of this experience vs what you have found on va.gov?

Copayments: time-dependent and if relevant

what information is important: this is pretty clear, it tells you where it is from, you can review details. I don‚Äôt know how to make it any better than this. 

There is the due date, I don‚Äôt know what else you need. 

Do you receive statements: Yeah I get all of my bank statements online. 

Overall how do you use them: I don‚Äôt they just go to my inbox unless I need to dispute something. 

Thoughts on this statement here: If I had copays if I needed to dispute something they were trying to charge me for this could be helpful. 

What might you do with it: Just in case type of thing. Having them there you don‚Äôt know until you see the statement.

Go ahead and open the statement, useful in app: It is just a scanned version of the one they send you. nicer than the one they send because it wont get thrown out. 

Anything to keep track of it: in case you need to dispute something its nice to have. 

Process to dispute: Maybe under pay bill. Oh request help. It doesn‚Äôt even look like an option. 

Thoughts on help in right corner: that helps. When you see that typically I think that‚Äôs more for help for the site not for the bill. See how it says copay help that would have been helpful. 

How would you make a payment: Pay bill: pay on pay.gov. 

Thoughts on finding account number: I would click where do I find my ca account number. I would copy the account number. 

Other thoughts, information that might be helpful: No, it is nice a simple. 

Labels, how to make it clear: No, I haven‚Äôt done it before so I don‚Äôt know what all you need. 

Those are all my questions. I‚Äôm going to check in with my team to see if anyone has any questions. If anyone would like to ask anything, you can unmute yourself and ask now.

Is there anything else you would like to share regarding managing finances that you haven‚Äôt yet shared?

**Consent to use video clips**



* I want to check once again that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners with your identifying information removed.
* Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?

**Thank-You and Closing**

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the digital experience and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again and enjoy the rest of your day!
