Start recording.



* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? Yes
* Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you? Yeah that‚Äôs okay

**Discussion**

Could you tell me a bit about yourself as a Veteran: what branch of the military did you serve, and when did you retire or separate?  Well I am an old timer I am 82, I was in [redacted] from 66 to 72 I was  [redacted]

How have you been involved with the VA ‚Äì both in the past and now? I don‚Äôt get a pension. Yes I live in [redacted] and I use the VA. We are between [redacted] I were [redacted] because it is more accessible. If you aren‚Äôt mobile [redacted] is harder to get around. [redacted] is easier to get around. 



* Have you used the website and/or app? For what purpose(s)?  No problems it is easy to sign in and I use myHealtheVet to do what I need to do. I order prescriptions and see what is happening, I use the website. Does not really use the app, rather use the laptop because it is easier. The phone is difficult. 
* What is difficult: using the phone is more difficult because it is an old guy thing. 

Now we're going to move to the financial portion of our discussion. I want to make sure that you‚Äôre only sharing what you‚Äôre willing ‚Äì I have no additional information about you or your finances with the VA.

**Cohort 2 - Copays ‚úÇÔ∏è ‚úÇÔ∏è ‚úÇÔ∏è ‚úÇÔ∏è**



* *Overview of their financial obligations*
    * (copays) What is your experience with medical copayments through the VA? About 2-3 years ago I got a call that I owed from a copayment and they can go back 5 years. They said I had to pay or you can be refused benefits, so I had to pay it. I can go back 5 years. Now. 
    * Notified: they called me. 
        * Do you receive any of these bills? If so, how?  I am [redacted] and I do have a copay, normally [redacted] for a prescription which is reason because I was in the guard instead of the active-duty service. 

 \




* *Notifications/awareness*
    * (copays) Tell me how you learn that you have a bill.
        * Tell me what prompts you to make a payment: the paperwork instead when they send the medication. I see the copay and then wait for the bill and then pay it. 
        * What is your thought on how the bills are presented to you? it comes in the mail. 
        * How are you paying the bills? (mobile/web, how often, payment method) Normally I go online and pay through the online site using my laptop. 
        * How often: Every 3 months about. I typically pay every 3 months for copays. 
        * Is there anything that could make things easier for you? no it is straight forward. When I get my [redacted] it is [redacted] a month and it clearly states that there is a copay. The [redacted] there is no copay and it states there is no copay. When I get my [redacted] I know there is a copay.
        * Only way you are notified is by mail: Only paper bill, nothing online. 

**Prototype & Usability**

I'm going to be showing you a prototype of the mobile app, with some new features that we're testing out before we consider building them.

*(request they share screen)*

Please open up the Figma app, and I‚Äôll be walking you through how to sign in.



* *(share test credentials with them)*
* *(after logging in, send them¬†[prototype link](https://www.figma.com/proto/kRA7JHbthNrSLxTQHrzH8T/MFS---Overpayments---Copays-%7C-VA-Mobile?page-id=2001%3A429&node-id=7274-61308&p=f&viewport=24600%2C-1348%2C0.59&t=RzEWQo0ZfxtjJRxF-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=7274%3A61308&show-proto-sidebar=1)¬†over Zoom chat)*

From home screen



* You're on the home screen of our pretend mobile app.: have you seen this; No 
* Don‚Äôt yet click on anything: show me where to find what money you currently owe:  Well it looks like latest payment. Messages maybe or claims. 
    * How clear was that to find?
    * Tell me your thoughts on the title of that section.
        * What would you expect to find there?
        * Are there other names that would be a better description or make things easier to find?
* Now click into that tab
    * What are your thoughts on the info presented here? Va payment history. Well how‚Äôs that. Okay. It isn‚Äôt doing anything. 
    * Now that you see what‚Äôs in this section: any further thoughts on the name ‚Äúpayments‚Äù? 
    * Regarding the info below the word "copay" ‚Äì what would be the most helpful to see there?

Copayments

*(no payment option)*¬†‚ùå üíµ ‚ùå



* Find what you currently owe for copayments: Well I would look to see what the payments are for, the balance and why I have it so I would review the balance. 
* Review: the balance, account number, copay for doctor/medicine. Yeah different stuff. I don‚Äôt see one for 50 dollars. 
* What are you looking for: Well no because I want the one for 50, and its not on there. 
* When you get your bill, is it one charge or more than one: It depends, if it‚Äôs a prescription its 1 charges a month, my [redacted] there‚Äôs no copay my [redacted] is the same each month. 
* The [redacted] shows three times if its once every 3 months: no what they do is online where it shows is [redacted], then the line over is [redacted] dollars since it is for 90 days. 
* This is confusing because 50 isn‚Äôt represented: correct
    * How clear was that to find?
    * What can you tell me about the other copayments on this screen?
* After you have a medical appointment, when would you expect to see the copayment appear here?
    * How would you expect to be notified?
* What do you need to know for each copay due?
    * How easy/difficult is it to find relevant information?
* Are you usually visiting different VA locations for your healthcare?
    * How clearly is everything presented here? (do they know the copays from locations are grouped?)
* *[point to a specific copay]*¬†What can you tell me about your activity here?
    * Is it clear when the payment is due?
* If you pay off a copay, would you want to see it?
    * Here or anywhere else?
    * Are there any here that you believe are paid off? How clear is it?
* Let‚Äôs pretend you see an error ‚Äì¬†*[point to a specific copay]*¬†one of the copays is for an appointment that you did not have. What would you do? I would look for a number and call them.
* Where on the app here: Probably on the top someplace. The number is in the upper right-hand corner of the bill. 
* Anywhere else you might look: I might go to the current statement and look on there: Yeah there‚Äôs the phone number. 
* Would you use the statement for anything else: it would take me to pay.gov to pay the bill
* Do you keep the statement: I file them in the file cabinet I do not the throw them away
* Digital statements: Anything I get from the VA I keep it and I file it in the filing cabinet. 
* Printed anything from the phone: If I knew how but I normally don‚Äôt print off my phone, I don‚Äôt know how to do that. 
* Anything else you are looking for: I would get ahold of my clinic, I was on [redacted] and I was on 1 unit a week and they upped it to 2 units a week and I [redacted] and I wanted to go back to 1 a week. They ordered a new prescription of 2 so now va shows up with more [redacted] at 2. So I called the clinic at 2 so I told them to take the copay away. It took away to get the va to admit the doctor was wrong. I watch carefully what I get from the va. 
* What else from here: Really nothing as long as I see what is happening from here. If I see something that didn‚Äôt happen I will call the va about it. the clinic or the number on the bill. 
* How to make payment: do to statement and make a payment and pay out of my payment. 
* Can you show me. No because I use my laptop, my phone is my phone.
    * What sort of info or guidance might you look for?
* Now we‚Äôre going to pretend that you don‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre going to have the money to pay the most recent copay bills. Walk me through what you would do in this situation.
    * What sort of info or guidance might you look for?
    * Is it clear when you would have to start something?
    * What are your thoughts on opening new windows for the information?
* Were you aware of these options for financial help? If so, how did you learn?
* What else would you want to do here with regards to your copays?
    * How would you expect to make payments?
    * What are your thoughts on this new section not having a payment option?
    * If this were to be built in real life, how likely would you be to use it? Well I probably wouldn‚Äôt because my phone isn‚Äôt hooked up to my printer so I can save it to my phone and I like hard copies . 
    * What about to review the information: yes. Well, you know if I get something in my email I would open it and read it then save it to my documents. 
    * What do you do that on: Phone and computer
    * Would you save pdfs to documents: on my laptop yes but not my phone because I don‚Äôt use it for
    * What do you use your phone for: I use it for Facebook, call people, receive calls. I am 82. That‚Äôs all I need it for. My laptop is the link to the world, my phone not so much. 

*(with payment option)*¬†‚úÖ üíµ ‚úÖ



* Now I'm going to have you¬†[open another prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/kRA7JHbthNrSLxTQHrzH8T/MFS---Overpayments---Copays-%7C-VA-Mobile?page-id=2001%3A429&node-id=7372-28070&p=f&viewport=24600%2C-1348%2C0.59&t=RzEWQo0ZfxtjJRxF-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=7372%3A28070&show-proto-sidebar=1)¬†to view a different version.¬†*(with payment option)*

        Review details: I would go to the current statement and go from there and pay it on the phone. I would call instead of using pay.gov. 


        Pay bill: it shows different options and I normally use pay.gov. 


        Also use the phone: I may but probably not. 


        All by pay.gov: Always


        What if you cant pay the copay, what might you do: I might go to the statement to see who I might need to call. That would give me the number to call. 


        Click on help in the right, thoughts on these options: How to request debt relief. I would have to submit a form, surprise right. Right. 


        Have you always done forms on your laptop: yes, on my laptop. Absolutely. 


        Thoughts on information under help, useful: Yeah I mean it gave different options. I would try that one first and go from there. 


        Easy or difficult to find: I don‚Äôt know, not easy and not hard. It might take time to get to the right one. 


        How could it be easier: the number could be there where you could talk to a live person where they had submit a form. 


        What about knowing to tap help: I wouldn‚Äôt have noticed the help button without you telling me


        How to make it noticeable: make it bigger


        Anything else: no it says help just needs to be bigger


        Looking for older statements: Lets see, go to help, questions about copay bills. I would look there. 


        Scroll to the bottom, PDF statements here, thoughts, hard/easy: I tap on it and it isn‚Äôt doing everything. Here goes the payments.  


        Hard/easy to find: We are talking about the bill right, I would copy that right there. 


        What would you want to do after you copy that. I would look for what I am looking for. 

    * If you are ready to make a payment on this bill, walk me through how you would do that.
    * Talk to me about that experience of starting to make the payment (e.g. opening .gov, new sign-in, copying payment + account info)
    * After you‚Äôve paid this bill, what would you expect to see? When would you expect to see an update?
    * If this were to be built in real life, how likely would you be to use it?
    * How would the likelihood of you using this compare to the previous version where you were not able to make payments?
* *(if user has not brought them up already)*¬†Talk to me about your monthly statements for copays
    * Were you aware of them?
    * Do you read them now? If so, what purpose do they serve? What are you doing with them?
    * Walk me through exploring them in the prototype here.
    * What are your thoughts on the PDFs here?
* Now that we‚Äôve gone through this section, any other thoughts you‚Äôd like to share on what is here and how the information is presented?
* What are your thoughts on how the sections and pages are labeled? They are bold and what they are for. 
    * Are there other titles that would make more sense to you?
* *(if relevant)*¬†Can you tell me what you think of this experience vs what you have found on va.gov?

Overpayments: time-dependent and if relevant

Those are all my questions. I‚Äôm going to check in with my team to see if anyone has any questions. If anyone would like to ask anything, you can unmute yourself and ask now.

Is there anything else you would like to share regarding managing finances that you haven‚Äôt yet shared? Very interesting topic here. I am fine the way they are really. 

**Consent to use video clips**



* I want to check once again that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners with your identifying information removed.
* Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?

**Thank-You and Closing**

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the digital experience and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again and enjoy the rest of your day!
