Notes

* Explanation for developer mode: Google Play is the standard way apps are sent to Android phones. Because the version we’re testing today is still in development, it hasn't gone through Google’s final review yet, and therefor it’s blocked by default. We need to adjust a setting to allow you to download it, and we’ll make sure to turn it back off once we’re finished.
