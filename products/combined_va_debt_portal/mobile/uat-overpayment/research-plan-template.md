	# Research Plan for Mobile Feature Support, Debt Portal: Overpayments in mobile app UAT, January 2026

## Background 🏗️

_This is a User Acceptance Test (UAT) as a follow-up from the Usability Test of [Overpayments and Copayments on mobile app](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/combined_va_debt_portal/mobile/research-plan.md?plain=1)._
_Overpayments will be the first section to be released in the mobile app. Copays will be released at a later date._

Veterans can experience debt from the VA. The two types of debt that the Financial Management Team has focused on include: 

* Overpayments   
* Copayments (also referred to as copays)

Benefit overpayment debt can occur when a Veteran receives more compensation than they are entitled to, and it is handled by the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA). Examples of overpayments include a dependent change from a divorce, or even when a Veteran receives education benefits for a class but then drops the class and does not report that. In these instances, the Veteran will owe money to the VA for such actions. 

Copayments are part of an individual's health insurance and are the amount of money owed for a specific healthcare service or prescription; the remainder of the cost is covered by insurance. Veterans with medical copayment debt from the VA have received care at a VA health facility. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) manages medical copayments.  

Veterans can view their overpayment and copayment debts through the authenticated experience on VA.gov. After logging on, they can access their debt portal through the My VA tab. If overpayment or copayment debt exists, Veterans can take the following actions: 

* View the debt  
* Make a payment and resolve the debt online  
* Dispute charges   
* Request assistance from the VA for financial hardship (by completing the Financial Status Report, VA Form 5655\)  
* View resources about VA debt management

`What problem is your product trying to solve?`

The mobile app does not have any debt-related information for Veterans to access. How might we provide Veterans with the ability to view the total amount owed for benefit overpayment debts, as well as the details related to that debt on the mobile app?  
  
`Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)`

Authenticated section of VA Mobile App, to be added to the existing "Payments" tab.
  
`What is Veterans’ familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?`

Veterans currently manage their debt on VA.gov; this will be a new addition to the mobile app.

`Product Brief`
[Link to product brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/combined_va_debt_portal/mobile/Overpayment%20and%20Copayment%20Debts%20Product%20Brief.md)


### [OCTO-DE Priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202025.md) 

`Objective 1:  VA’s digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.`  

> - **Key Result 1:** Improve satisfaction with our web and mobile products by 5 points.
> - **Key Result 3:** 100% of transactions received via our digital experiences are either processed correctly or we have notified the user of an error.


### [Veteran Journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)

Where does your product fit into the Veteran journey?
Are there moments that matter?
	
- `Starting Up (Moment: Balancing Finances)`
- `Taking Care of Myself (Moment: Maintaining my health)`
- `Putting Down Roots (Moment: Maintaining my financial, social, and emotional health)`
- `Retiring (Moment: Taking care of my health)`
- `Aging (Moment that Matters: Managing my declining health)`


## Research Goals 🥅	
`What are you trying to learn from this research?` 

The purpose of this User Acceptance Testing (UAT) study is to validate that all elements in the Overpayments functionality operate as expected for end users with real user data. Unlike usability testing, this study focuses on verifying expected behavior, not on whether users can find or discover features.


> [!NOTE]
> Limit 3 goals per study. If you have more than 3 goals, consider how to break up your research into iterative studies.

### Hypotheses
> [!NOTE]
> Remember to constrain the hypotheses to the goals of your study!
 
**Think through these prompts to develop strong hypotheses:**
	
`What do you intend to learn and measure from this study?` 

`What do you already know about this problem space?`
 
`What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the study, so don’t skip this step!)`
  
`Write a generalized statement that combines what you know + what you think will happen during the study.`

## Recruitment 🎯	
*OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers.*

> [!NOTE]
> Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources: 
> - [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/recruiting-participants) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research. 
> - [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.

### Recruitment approach
*Who is your intended audience for this research (e.g. Veterans, caregivers, VSOs, SMEs), and how will you recruit them?* 
- Perigean **CANNOT** recruit VA employees or VSOs. Work with your VA lead to recruit these groups. 
- Perigean can also support remote, [unmoderated studies](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/perigean-recruiting-process-for-unmoderated-studie), however, these studies require strict recruitment requirements. 
- Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Read this [introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md) and use the [recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity.

### Recruitment criteria

- **Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants.**
- Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question.
  Example: Have you been to a VA urgent care facility in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]

- The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria.
- Consider how you could leverage the [lean maximum variation sampling (MVS) approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md#lean-mvs-strategy) by breaking up criteria for your study into multiple cohorts that each isolate one primary criteria.
- Perigean will consider each cohort as a separate recruitment effort, increasing the chances of meeting all criteria for your study. [Review an example of the multiple cohort approach.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/pre-mhv-prototype/generative-research-study-1/2020-12.research-plan1.md)

### List the ideal completed sessions and total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study:
> [!NOTE]
> Your total number should equal **1.5x** your ideal completed sessions number *(e.g. for 10 ideal completed sessions, request 15 total participants)*


- `Veterans:` **[n]**
- `Caregivers:` **[n]**
- `Dependents:` **[n]**
- `Total:` **[n]**
- `Ideal completed sessions:` **[n]**

### Primary criteria (must-haves)
*What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study?* 

- `[Place primary criteria here between hash marks when in edit mode]`

## Timeline 🗓️
> [!NOTE]
> **Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person.** 

### Optional Kick-off Call with Perigean

- `Suggested dates and times:` **[Enter dates and times MM/DD HH:MM]**

### Prepare
*When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).*

**A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session.**

### Length of sessions
- `Session length: (e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours)` **[Enter time length]**
  
- `Buffer time between sessions: (30 minutes recommended to reset between sessions, debrief with team, if a participant arrives late, or a session goes slightly over time)` **[Enter buffer time]**
  
- `Maximum Sessions per day: (We all have limits - how many sessions can you and your team conduct in one day considering the session length, the mental strain of conducting sessions, other work you still need to complete in a day, etc?)` **[Enter NUM per day]**

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. 

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S. 

> [!TIP]
> Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. **(e.g. 3/17, Monday 9:00AM-1:00PM, 3:00PM-6:00PM EST; 3/18, Tuesday 9:00AM-6:00PM EST, etc.;** ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
