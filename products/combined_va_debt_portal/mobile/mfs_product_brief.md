# Debt Services Product Brief

## Overview

Veterans can experience debt from the Veterans Affairs. The two types of debt that the Financial Management Team have focused on include: 

* Overpayments   
* Copayments (also referred to as copays)

Overpayments occur when a Veteran receives more compensation than they are entitled to and are handled by Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA). Examples of overpayments include a dependent change from a divorce or even when a Veteran receives education benefits for a class but then drops the class and does not report that. In these instances, the Veteran will owe money to the VA for such actions. Copays are part of an individual's health insurance and are the amount of money owed for a specific healthcare service or prescription; the remainder of the cost is covered by insurance. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) manages copayments.  

Currently, Veterans can access their debt through the authenticated experience on VA.gov. After logging on, they can access their debt portal through the My VA tab. If Veterans have debt that they owe the VA, their debt is split between copays and overpayments. The respective debts can be viewed and resolved online, over the phone, by mail, or by paying in person. 

The debt portal allows Veterans to dispute charges and request assistance from the VA for financial hardship by completing the Financial Status Report (VA Form 5655). Currently, the Financial Management Team is implementing the One VA Debt Letter, which will provide Veterans with a summary of all their VA debts, specifically overpayments and copays debt. 

## Problem Statement

Mobile app users cannot access any information about their debts or have the ability to make payments, dispute changes, or view letters associated with VA debt. How might we provide Veterans with the ability to view and manage their debts on the mobile app?  

## Bets to be Informed by Research

* Veterans will want to have an overview of their overpayment and copayment debts on the mobile app.  
* Veterans will want to view all types of debts separately.   
* Veterans will want to see details about their benefit overpayment debt information on the mobile app so that they understand the amount they owe.  
* Veterans will want to see details about their medical copayment debt information on the mobile app to understand the amount they owe.  
* Veterans will want the ability to make a debt payment from the mobile app.   
* Veterans might not understand overpayment and copayment debts and will want information on VA Debt Management resources and support.  
* Veterans will want information on steps to dispute a charge or request financial assistance.  
* Filling out the Financial Status Report (VA Form 5655\) on the app will be too cumbersome for Veterans to complete.   
* Veterans will want to view debt-related letters, such as the One VA Debt Letter.   
* Veterans will want to receive payment reminders on the mobile app so they do not miss a debt payment.

## Important Notes/Decisions/Background

* Debt Service work came to the MFS team through a startup conversation between Jeff Barnes and Rachel Han in October 2024\.  
* There is no specific initiative or timeframe for this work.  
* VBA stands for Veterans Benefits Administration  
* VHA stands for Veterans Health Administration  
* Resources and support page on VA Debt can be found [here](https://www.va.gov/resources/va-debt-management/).   
* From user research conducted by the Financial Management Team, they reported a key finding that “everyone was excited about the potential of a mobile app and the ability to manage their VA bills and debt in the mobile app”.    
* For Veterans to pay their overpayments online, a new tab will open from VA.gov, taking them to [pay.va.gov](https://www.pay.va.gov/).  
* For Veterans to pay their copayments online, a new tab will open from VA.gov, taking them to pay.gov.    
* Debt Letters are sent in the mail and aren’t available in a digital format at this time. These letters are reminders to pay the debt.  
* Debt Letters were taken off the Debt Portal in 2024, due to PII issues out of the Financial Management Team’s control.  
* The Financial Status Report (VA Form 5655\) is a form to request debt resolution, debt compromise, or monthly debt payments.      
* As of April 2025, the Financial Management web team is implementing the One VA Debt Letter on VA.gov. Adding the One VA Debt Letter will be a separate initiative for mobile, with its own product brief.   
* During a meeting with the Financial Management team, they discussed adding additional debt types, but this is not currently being planned. These debt types include:  
  * Travel pay  
  * Legal fees  
* According to the Financial Management Team, Veterans can have a lot of copayments.  
* The streamlined waiver path of the Financial Status Report (FSR \- VA Form 5655\) is currently live and provides Veterans who meet qualifications to bypass sections of the FSR. This waiver will only apply  to Veterans who have copays and reduces the time required to complete the Financial Status Report (which is \~60 minutes).  
* [Here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/benefits-memorials-2/staging-users-debtproducts.md) is the Debt Resolution Staging Users by Product, with \+81 being a good [test user](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/blob/master/Administrative/vagov-users/mvi-staging-users.csv).
