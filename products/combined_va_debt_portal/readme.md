# Combined VA debt portal

This project's goal is to combine [the VA Debt Portal](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/debt-letters-mvp) and [the Medical Copay Tool](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/Debt%20Resolution/Medical_Copays) into one centralized location where Veterans can access information about their VA debts and copay bills as well as learn about their options to pay or request financial help.
