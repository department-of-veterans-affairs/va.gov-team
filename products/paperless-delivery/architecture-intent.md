# Paperless Delivery Architecture Intent

- Product description
  - Brief overview of motivation for the change from an engineering & security point of view
    - We want to expose the ability for Veterans to receive their forms electronically rather than by postal mail
    - This product will live in the communication settings section of the VA.gov interface
  - Link to Collaboration Cycle Request issue
    - https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/106128

  - Call out any engineering challenges; UX is reviewed in the Design Intent meeting
    - N/A
- Frontend changes
  - Identify any significant code changes
    - We will create a dedicated page where Veterans can view and update their paperless delivery settings
    - We will display a link to manage paperless delivery settings in the Communication settings card on the VA.gov Profile page
    - We will display a nested link under Communication settings in the side navigation on the VA.gov profile page
    - We will exclude Paperless Delivery from displaying in the Communication settings page
  - Identify any new design system components needed or changes to current components
    - The Design System team will create a component to support a hierarchical, nested link for side navigation
  - Describe any product analytics being gathered

    - No
  - Do you have API documentation?
    - No
  - Describe expected call patterns
    - Pattern: View Paperless Delivery settings
      - GET request is made to `/v0/profile/communication_preferences` to retrieve paperless delivery settings
    - Pattern: Modify Paperless Delivery settings
      - PUT request is made to `/v0/profile/communication_preferences` when user selects or deselects the paperless delivery checkbox
- External API changes
  - List new or modified APIs for upstream or external systems
    - None
  - Describe expected call patterns
    - N/A
  - What PII or PHI will be transmitted to/from the external systems?
    - None

    - None
  - Describe error and dead letter handling
    - N/A
- Data storage
  - Describe new or modified databases, tables or columns
    - None
  - Describe indexes and constraints
    - N/A
  - Identify PII and PHI and where and how it will be stored, processed, expired and deleted
    - N/A
- Libraries and dependencies
  - List new or updated dependences
    - The side navigation link is dependent on the creation of a new component that supports nested side navigation links
- Metrics, logging, observability, alerting
  - Identify key areas to monitor
    - We will add a new DataDog dashboard and monitor
- Infrastructure and network changes
  - List any changes or additions
    - None
- Test strategy
  - Describe automated, manual and user acceptance test strategy
    - No automated testing is planned
    - Manual testing can be done by logging in as a test user, navigating to the Paperless Delivery page and verifying paperless delivery settings are persistent through sessions
  - Describe required test data and test user accounts
    - Any VA.gov test user will satisfy our needs
- Rollout plan
  - List scope of any feature flags
    - A feature flag will be added on vets-website to expose the paperless delivery option
  - Identify other teams to coordinate with
    - VA Profile and VHA Enrollment system
  - Describe rollback plan
    - Turn off feature flag for users
- Internal administration tasks
  - What maintenance or administration tasks do you anticipate will need to be performed periodically?
    - None
