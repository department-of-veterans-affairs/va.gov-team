## **Research Goals**

Reducing the need to mail paper represents a significant opportunity for cost savings for the VA. Transitioning to digitize all documents for Veterans is a major initiative that will require substantial time and manpower. Currently, only two documents—the disability compensation decision letter and the 1095-B—are available digitally.

As more informational documents are converted to digital formats, it would be beneficial to establish a central location where Veterans can opt in to paperless delivery for these documents in the authenticated Veteran experiences.

The purpose of this research is **to see if the planned first release and future designs for paperless delivery settings make it easy to find and update their preferences.**

We’ll use what we learned to make usability improvements before starting development on VA.gov. 


## **Research Questions**

- **RQ1:** Are users interested in receiving some or all forms or communications digitally instead of by mail?

- **RQ2:** What factors influence Veterans' trust in digital document delivery?

- **RQ3:** Are there any documents they would be hesitant to receive digitally? Why?

- **RQ4:** How do Veterans perceive the security of their data in paperless systems?

- **RQ5:** Where do Veterans expect to find and update their paperless delivery settings for the 1095-B?

- **RQ6:** Can Veterans easily navigate to the section where they would update their paperless delivery settings without assistance?

- **RQ7:** Does the Veteran experience any pain points or confusion when navigating to or making updates to their paperless delivery settings?

- **RQ8:** Does the word “paperless” clearly tell Veterans that they won’t get paper mail and will need to go online to see their documents? If not, what terminology would they prefer?

- **RQ9:** After updating their paperless delivery settings, do users feel confident that their changes have been saved and will take effect?

- **RQ10:** Do users understand what will happen when they make a selection? Do they think they’re opting in or out? And is that the same as what the system actually does?

- **RQ11:** Do Veterans feel more comfortable with radio buttons or check boxes as their paperless option selection method?

- **RQ12:** After signing up for paperless delivery, what kind of confirmation or follow-up communication do users expect?

- **RQ13:** Do they expect reminders or notifications for new digital documents?

- **RQ14:** What barriers, beyond technical ability, might prevent Veterans from opting for paperless delivery (e.g., trust, perceived complexity)?

- **RQ15:** How do Veterans currently store and access important documents, and how does that influence their willingness to go paperless?


## **Methodology**

- **Semi-structured interview questions**- For understanding Veterans’ past experiences with paperless delivery and how they feel about it

- **Contextual inquiry-** For exploring where Veterans expect to set up paperless delivery on VA.gov.

- **Usability testing** – For testing whether Veterans can update their 1095-B paperless settings using the prototype.

- **A/B testing** – For comparing usability and preference of radio buttons vs checkboxes and different wording options (Paperless, Paper-free, Online documents).


## **Hypotheses and Conclusion**

#### Our hypothesis is that participants will have the desire to sign up for paperless delivery and they will be able to update their paperless settings confidently using the prototypes we provide. We also expect that Veterans may require additional support or guidance to adopt paperless settings confidently.

### Conclusion: True for the majority of participants!

The majority of participants wanted not only paperless delivery of documents but also of notifications. While all participants saw the value of having a paperless option, 2/18 participants still wanted to keep getting paper mail as a primary mode of communication.

All participants could easily update their paperless settings once they were on the right page in the prototype, but some had trouble seeing the communication preferences section on the Profile, and many had trouble knowing where to navigate from the Home page.

There were many Veterans who expressed that they would like additional support or guidance to their paperless settings.

**Quotes:**

> “You know, they need to catch up with the times.” - P4

>“It's much easier for me to handle everything on my laptop or my, you know, my phone because I can't go to his house all the time and pick up the mail.”- P18

>“I mean, the only thing I'd say is it's nice to have the paper record.” - P2

>“And I like this. I like this. This interface right here. It seemed like it was really easy to understand that I'm going to my communication settings.” - P8

>“I think that it's good that it's labeled separately because I think sometimes people are looking for that like paperless option.” - P7

>“It focuses me on what I want to come via digital delivery and just kind of. It's just more straightforward as far as I'm concerned.” – P2

>“It's just extremely simple.” - P13

>“Discoverability of some documents online is… it can be really difficult. So you need some kind of clear communication. If you need me to do something, give me a link.” - P11


## **Key Findings & details**

### **RQ1: Are users interested in receiving some or all forms or communications digitally instead of by mail?**

**Finding:** Most Veterans are interested in receiving some or all communications digitally. They value the convenience, organization, security, and flexibility digital access offers—especially when traveling. Many are already used to handling information online and don’t see the need to print most documents. Digital delivery also helps reduce paper waste, clutter, and stress. Some still prefer paper for specific needs like proof or easy reference.  

**Quotes:**

>“All of my bank statements come electronically… That way, there's also no PII out there for anybody to grab as it's coming in the mail.” -P1

>“If I want to go visit my cousin… I can still get everything I need to get and don't have to worry about, oh, did it go to the house?” -P1

>“I try to get rid of paper in my house… he had too much paper. We're done. I can't handle all the paper.” -P18

>“As long as I can get them, you know, at least by email, I'm happy.” -P9

>“I still like the hard copy for those. I would like the option maybe to—if I want them digitally—but I still like both.” -P20

>“They wanted a copy of something that proved I was a disabled veteran… so I had to go in there and print off a copy of a letter… an updated letter that was current of that week.” -P2

***


### **RQ2: What factors influence Veterans' trust in digital document delivery?**

**Finding:** Security, convenience, and control drive trust in digital delivery. 

Many Veterans trust digital delivery because they feel it’s more secure than physical mail, which can be lost, stolen, or delayed—especially when they’re traveling, live in shared housing, or have concerns about mailbox theft. Digital systems that require secure logins, offer verification, and store documents in centralized, password-protected accounts give Veterans confidence that their information is protected.

Veterans also value the control digital delivery provides—they can access documents anytime, from anywhere, without waiting for mail or relying on others to retrieve it. The ability to store, print, or delete documents as needed helps reduce the risk of personal information being left out in the open or thrown away improperly.

Trust is also linked to clear communication and good user experience. Veterans want prompt notifications and direct links to documents so they don’t miss important updates. Confusion or difficulty finding documents online, or unclear labels like “paperless” vs “online documents,” can reduce confidence in the system.

Finally, personal experience matters. Veterans who already manage other aspects of their life online—like banking or prescriptions—tend to be more comfortable and trusting of VA’s digital systems. Still, some noted concerns about discoverability, inconsistent notifications, or the desire for clearer options and confirmation when opting in or out of paperless settings.

**Quotes:**

>“All my bank statements come electronically… no PII out there for anybody to grab as it's coming in the mail.” -P1

>“I'd rather just be all electronic… I set up my account and it had to be verified by them.” -P10

>“Mailbox break-ins… worth the money to redirect to a PO box.” -P19

>“If I had any reservation toward security… I probably wouldn’t be using that platform altogether.” -P16

### **RQ3: Are there any documents they would be hesitant to receive digitally? Why?**

**Finding:** Some Veterans are hesitant to receive certain documents digitally, especially when they need an official copy, quick access, or extra reassurance.\
\
While most Veterans are comfortable accessing documents online, there are a few types they prefer to receive—or at least have the option to receive—as hard copies. Some documents, like **annual disability letters** or **proof of Veteran status for benefits like hunting licenses**, are occasionally required in original or printed form, and a paper version can feel more **official or dependable** in those moments. Veterans emphasized that having a **current, printable version online is essential**, but having a mailed copy as backup is still appreciated. 

**Quotes:**

>“Some states… it has to be an original document and not a copy.” -P1

>“Annual disability letter is nice to get a hard copy… it’s not a requirement.” -P2

>“My appointments… they'll text me… but labs I wouldn’t want to miss.” -P7

>“No, because I can just print it out if it comes digitally.” -P4

>“I print one off the website because it gives an up to date data.” -P2

>“I print things out and bring them with me from the va, because some of the medications have names that I'm not a doctor, so it's very hard to pronounce.” -P19

***


### **RQ4: How do Veterans perceive the security of their data in paperless systems?**

**Finding:** Veterans largely see digital as more secure than paper, especially given physical vulnerabilities. 

**Quotes:**

>“Electronically, and that way there’s… no PII out there.” - P1

>“People breaking into mailboxes… that was concerning me.” -P19

>“I find apps and online a pretty good source… Because I gotta shred them \[paper documents].” -P11

>“I’d feel more comfortable getting that communication directly through the platform.” - P16

***


### **RQ5: Where do Veterans expect to find and update their paperless delivery settings for the 1095-B?**

**Finding:** Many Veterans said they would look for their settings, account, or profile—typically located in the top right corner of the page—when trying to update paperless delivery options.

Some expected to make updates under **communication preferences**, while others thought they would find these options in their **contact information** section. A few said they would try to **contact the VA directly** to figure out how to make changes.

Participants often looked for terms like **“paperless,” “digital,” “electronic,”** or **“paper”** to help guide their navigation.

**Quotes:**

>“Probably like communication settings. I feel like that's where I've seen it also in the past and like for other platforms.” -P16

>“It should be under Profile.” - P4

>“Receipt of docs—paperless or paper.” -P18

>“Under preferences and communications… Do you want hard copy or electronic copy?” -P1

***


### **RQ6: Can Veterans easily navigate to the section where they would update their paperless delivery settings without assistance?**

**Finding:** Most participants were able to find their delivery preferences from their profile, but some had trouble locating it from the homepage without assistance. Additionally, some expected their delivery preferences to be located closer to their contact information. A few participants expressed that they would contact the VA for help to find where they needed to go.

**Quotes:**

>“Something will pop up and say that, you know, you can get this paperless.” -P19

>“Otherwise, I would check with search up here to see if there's anything that I could find through the search engine... (and search using the words) I guess I could use Paperless.” -P19

>“I would do contact us online or through the VA. And then I would ask the question, what is the process for changing delivery to online only or something.” -P17

>“Go up here to where it says contact us and maybe even write it. You know, write an email or a message or something to a message board that maybe I'll get to the right person” -P9

>“I would want it in here, in the contact information.”  -P15

>“I do wish it had been up underneath the contact information, but I mean, it's not the end of the world. I found it still.” -P7

>“Like, if there's a lot of stuff in here, then maybe having the two separate sections is. Is fine. But I think if one link here might make it a little easier to understand.” -P8

>“I think that it's good that it's labeled separately because I think sometimes people are looking for that like paperless option” -P7

***


### **RQ7: Does the Veteran experience any pain points or confusion when navigating to or making updates to their paperless delivery settings?**

**Finding:** Most Veterans were able to find and update their paperless delivery settings without much trouble. However, some ran into issues. A few expected to see an option to get only paper mail, which wasn’t there based on the language of the other two options. Others were confused about the difference between contact info, notifications, and paperless delivery. As mentioned above, some had a hard time finding where to go and said they would reach out to the VA for help. Finally, one participant wasn’t sure if they’d be able to change their preferences again after updating their settings.

**Quotes:**

>“Do you wish to receive only paper or only digital correspondence or both or whatever.” -P11

>“Because right here you're saying, send me both paper and unless you're going to put a little another circle around here and put. Just send paper only.” -P4

>“But then, I mean, I would still need that preference between text and email. So it being separate is a little bit wonky. Or like if say you had something that was completely paper notifications and you're not getting text or emails because you didn't already check that box.” -P7

>“I think paperless settings is kind of like a setting on its own… You opt in.” -P16

>(When asked what paperless delivery would apply to) “So I would say my notifications, my appointment notifications, my education status for GI Bill or VR and E or whatever. I'm using my messages from providers appointments.” -P11

>“This is really easy to understand that, hey, I'm enrolling in digital for this particular item for my doctor's appointment notifications.” -P8

***


### **RQ8: Does the word “paperless” clearly tell Veterans what it means? Preferred terminology?**

**Finding:** “Paperless” is generally understood but some prefer clearer or action-oriented terms. Many Veterans recognized that “paperless” means they would no longer receive paper mail and would instead access their documents online. Some even said terms like **“digital delivery”** or **“electronic copy”** also made sense and felt familiar.\
\
A few participants said the term “paperless” alone might be too subtle or easy to overlook. They suggested clearer, action-based language such as:

> “Stop mail delivery”
> “Get documents online”
> “Go paperless” (suggested by multiple participants)
> “Update mail settings”
> “Opt in or opt out of mail”

To reduce confusion, participants recommended combining the word “paperless” with clear explanations or a yes/no prompt like:

> “Do you want to stop getting documents by mail?”

**Quotes:**

>“Pretty much anybody… understands what paperless means.” - P9

>“How about ‘Do paperless?’” -P10

>“‘Go paperless.’” -P15

>“Send me paper mail and opt in the paperless delivery.” -P20

>“Maybe… ‘Enroll me in no paper delivery.’” -P6

***


### **RQ9: After updating their paperless delivery settings, do users feel confident that their changes have been saved and will take effect?**

**Finding:** Veterans generally trusted that their changes were saved but often double-checked to make sure. Some wanted more control over where their documents would be delivered. A few participants also said they’d like to select multiple items at once for paperless delivery and then save all their preferences with a single click save button.

**Quotes:**

>“Instead of like having options to be like, to be able to select what you want delivered where.” -P7

>“So I would have a physical button that says save my preference.” -P11

>“One of the things I might do is I might go to another screen and come back to see if it still is… showing that I'm opted.. in.” - P19

***


### **RQ10: Do users understand what will happen when they make a selection?**

**Finding:** Yes, most Veterans clearly understood whether they were opting in or out of paperless delivery when making a selection. Even when preferences were represented differently across prototypes, participants consistently interpreted the outcome correctly. However, a few participants thought they were opting in to stop receiving ALL paper documents and paper alerts when in reality they were only selecting one document (1095-B).

**Quotes:**

>“That means that everything. I wouldn't get any more paper copies. It would all come through text or email.” -P10

>“Yes, I want paperless delivery. No more paper mail. Right now it's. It just selects the 1095B proof of healthcare.” -P1

>“And this is exactly what I would see is that you can send me or opt in to the paperless like you, you. They give you all the choices of everything that they're going to send you. And you can either choose to get paperless or get paper.” -P18

***


### **RQ11: Do Veterans prefer radio buttons or checkboxes for paperless option selection?**

**Finding:** Veterans slightly favored radio buttons for single delivery choices and checkboxes for managing multiple options. Participants generally found both designs easy to use, but their preferences varied based on the context. Radio buttons were preferred when selecting one paperless delivery option, while checkboxes were favored when managing multiple paperless delivery settings. 

One participant initially missed that checkboxes were clickable, suggesting a need for better visual cues. Overall, both designs were usable. Including clear labels and visual grouping seemed to help improve usability for either option.

Some participants expressed that they would like the option to bulk select paperless option settings when interacting with the prototypes.

**Quotes:**

>“I think… \[radio buttons]… is a little more clear… two options.” -P7

>“I prefer this one \[radio buttons]… it's dumbed down… extremely simple.” -P13

>“I think I like \[checkboxes]… it links all the categories together… easier to read.” -P18

>“\[Checkboxes] focuses me on what I want to come via digital delivery and just kind of. It's just more straightforward as far as I'm concerned.” -P2

***

### **RQ12: After signing up for paperless delivery, what kind of confirmation or follow-up communication do users expect?**

**Finding:**Most Veterans expect to receive a confirmation message after changing their delivery settings—especially via email. Some prefer a message that includes details about what was changed and when. This helps build trust in the system and serves as a reference point for future verification.

**Quotes:**

>“Yes, I would. I'd like to get an email that said my settings have been changed.” -P2

>“Maybe a text or an email… ‘This is to confirm that you have selected to go paperless for the 1095-B form.’” -P17

>“It would probably be good to get an email or something, just so you know that you made that change.” -P13

>“I’ve gotten an email that says you have selected paperless delivery for this account.” -P18

>“I think there’s one that says, ‘If you didn’t make these changes, please notify us.’”-P2

***


### **RQ13: Do Veterans expect reminders or notifications for new digital documents?**

**Finding:**Yes, Veterans expect to be notified when new documents are available digitally. Most prefer receiving alerts by **email, text message, or both**, depending on their communication preferences. Many emphasized that **text alerts help them act faster**, especially when emails may get overlooked in crowded inboxes.

**Quotes:**

>“If I need to see something, I should just get a notification… then I can look for it.” -P11

>“I honestly prefer a text notification… if it’s just in my email, the odds of that thing getting lost in there…” -P7

>“I like that it says they’ll send an email every time they add a new document. It would be nice to have a text option too.” -P7

>“If there’s new communication… it would be great to receive a text just… notifying you, like, ‘Hey, you have new communication on_ [_VA.gov_](http://va.gov)_.’” -P16

>“As long as I can choose how I’m being notified, that’s fine… I’d probably pick both.” -P7

>“A simple email to my main email address would be great.” -P21

>“I think I would have expected a little pop-up window to be like, ‘Hey, you're going back to paper. Are you sure?’” -P7

>“Go to this link below so you can see all the notes and the results. And then you click on there, sign into my VA and it takes you straight to the documentation.” -P11

***

### **RQ14: What barriers, beyond technical ability, might prevent Veterans from opting for paperless delivery (e.g., trust, perceived complexity)?**

**Finding:** While most Veterans are comfortable using digital systems, some worried about not knowing that documents are available due to lack of notifications and concerns about overlooked emails and uncertain system reliability. Others mentioned wanting proof of changes or confirmation. 

**Quotes:**

>“Not unless they send you an email saying, we've updated your preferences.” -P1

>“Go to this link below so you can see all the notes and the results. And then you click on there, sign into my VA and it takes you straight to the documentation.” -P11

>“If I didn’t feel like… if I felt like I had any type of security issue with my banking communication, then I probably \[would] feel like I would have a security issue with that bank in general.” -P16

>“So I would like to have a button here that tells my providers, no, send me message notification on text that you want to communicate with me or that my documents are available online.” -P11\

>“If it’s just in my email, like, the odds of that thing getting lost in there…” -P7

>“If it’s going to tell me it’s saved, I’mma 50% believe them.” -P4

>“When I go directly to Settings, something will pop up and say that, you know, you can get this paperless. You don't have to.” -P19

***


### **RQ15: How do Veterans currently store and access important documents, and how does that influence their willingness to go paperless?**

**Finding:** Veterans use a mix of strategies to stay organized—printing only when needed, saving digital copies, or accessing documents through secure VA portals. Many prefer the flexibility of printing documents on demand and appreciate avoiding paper clutter or security risks at home. Their existing digital habits generally support their willingness to go paperless.

**Quotes:**

>“Because I have a printer at home, and it’s just easier for me to open the document, save it to my computer, or print it if I need it.” -P13

>“I have all my documentation stored online at the VA. I don't want my medical documentation to just be in my house.” -P11

>“I try to get rid of paper in my house… he had too much paper. We’re done. I can’t handle all the paper.” -P18

>“So I had to go in there and print off a copy of a letter to scan to them… an updated letter that was current of that week.” -P2

>“Once I print it out… and I find out that I don’t need it anymore, I just go ahead and shred it.” -P19

>“Let’s see, it’s something called VA Portal. I have that saved on my computer. So I just click into the VA Portal and then I just start going in different directions.” -P19


## **Recommendations (Decision log)** 

Based on the results of the paperless delivery research conducted with Veterans we propose that the following directions, changes, and enhancements be implemented to the paperless design.

### **Recommendation 1: Add a message to the paperless delivery page letting Veterans know they can download or print any document.**

**Finding from RQ3:** Some Veterans are hesitant to receive certain documents digitally, especially when they need an official copy, quick access, or extra reassurance.

**Quotes:**

>“No, because I can just print it out if it comes digitally.” -P4

>“I print one off the website because it gives an up to date data.” -P2

>“I print things out and bring them with me from the va, because some of the medications have names that I'm not a doctor, so it's very hard to pronounce.” -P19


### **Recommendation 2: Add more detail to the in-line confirmation message so Veterans feel confident about what settings were saved and know what to expect next.**

**Finding RQ9:** Veterans trusted the change but often double-checked to confirm.

**Quotes:**

>“And then a notification says, are you sure this is the preference? Say, or something that describes the preference.” - P11

>“I think I would have expected a little pop up window to be like, hey, you're going back to paper. Are you sure? And I'm like, yes, I do want paper. And that's it.” -P7


### **Recommendation 3: Use defined categories to make it clearer which documents will be included in paperless delivery.**

**Finding RQ10:** However, a few participants thought they were opting in to stop receiving ALL paper documents and paper alerts when in reality they were only selecting one document (1095-B).\
\
**Finding RQ11:** Overall, both designs were usable. Including clear labels and visual grouping seemed to help improve usability for either option.

**Quotes:**

>“I think I like checkboxes… it links all the categories together… easier to read.” -P18

>“Like, per category. Like, I don't want you to send me my appointment notifications...” -P7

>“That means that everything. I wouldn't get any more paper copies. It would all come through text or email.” -P10


### **Recommendation 4: Update the text next to the checkboxes to make it clear why Veterans will always get their documents online and why there isn’t a paper-only option.**

**Finding RQ7:** Some expected to see an option to receive only paper mail, which wasn’t available.

**Quotes:**

>“Do you wish to receive only paper or only digital correspondence or both or whatever.” -P11

>“Because right here you're saying, send me both paper and unless you're going to put a little another circle around here and put. Just send paper only.” -P4


### **Recommendation 5: Send a text or email confirmation with a link whenever settings are changed.**

**Finding RQ9:** Veterans trusted the change but often double-checked to confirm.\
\
**Finding RQ12:** Most Veterans expect to receive a confirmation message after changing their delivery settings—especially via email. Some prefer a message that includes details about what was changed and when. This helps build trust in the system and serves as a reference point for future verification.

**Quotes:**

>“One of the things I might do is I might go to another screen and come back to see if it still is… showing that I'm opted.. in.” - P19

>“Yes, I would. I'd like to get an email that said my settings have been changed.” -P2

“Maybe a text or an email… ‘This is to confirm that you have selected to go paperless for the 1095-B form.’” -P17

>“It would probably be good to get an email or something, just so you know that you made that change.” -P13

>“I’ve gotten an email that says you have selected paperless delivery for this account.” -P18

>“I think there’s one that says, ‘If you didn’t make these changes, please notify us.’”-P2


### **Recommendation 6: Send a text or email when new documents are ready, and include a link to help Veterans get to them easily.**

**Finding RQ13:** Yes, Veterans expect to be notified when new documents are available digitally. Most prefer receiving alerts by **email, text message, or both**, depending on their communication preferences. Many emphasized that **text alerts help them act faster**, especially when emails may get overlooked in crowded inboxes. 

**Finding RQ14:** While most Veterans are comfortable using digital systems, several expressed concerns about trust, security, or the need for clearer communication. Some worried about missing documents due to unclear labeling or lack of notifications, while others mentioned wanting proof of changes or confirmation. Concerns about overlooked emails and uncertain system reliability also contributed to hesitation.

**Quotes:**

>“I honestly prefer a text notification… if it’s just in my email, the odds of that thing getting lost in there…” -P7

>“I like that it says they’ll send an email every time they add a new document. It would be nice to have a text option too.” -P7

>“If there’s new communication… it would be great to receive a text just… notifying you, like, ‘Hey, you have new communication on_ [_VA.gov_](http://va.gov)_.’” -P16

>“As long as I can choose how I’m being notified, that’s fine… I’d probably pick both.” -P7

>“A simple email to my main email address would be great.” -P21

>“Go to this link below so you can see all the notes and the results. And then you click on there, sign into my VA and it takes you straight to the documentation.” -P11


### **Recommendation 7: Provide in application guidance to settings with links.**

**Finding RQ14:** While most Veterans are comfortable using digital systems, some worried about missing documents due to unclear labeling or lack of notifications, while others mentioned wanting proof of changes or confirmation. Concerns about overlooked emails and uncertain system reliability also contributed to hesitation.

**Quotes:**

>“Go to this link below so you can see all the notes and the results. And then you click on there, sign into my VA and it takes you straight to the documentation.” -P11

>“When I go directly to Settings, something will pop up and say that, you know, you can get this paperless. You don't have to.” -P19


### **Recommendation 8: Group the contact information, notification settings, and paperless delivery options closer together on the profile page to make them easier to find. Add clear explanations to help Veterans understand the difference between a mailed notification and a mailed document or update.**

**Finding QR6:** Additionally, some expected their delivery preferences to be located closer to their contact information.

**Finding RQ7:** Others were confused about the difference between contact info, notifications, and paperless delivery.

**Quotes:**

>“Because I think this page is kind of cumbersome anyway. I think this could be laid out a lot better because it's like, I think there should be options for each. \[text, email, paper]” -P13

>“I do wish it had been up underneath the contact information, but I mean, it's not the end of the world. I found it still.” -P7

>“Like, if there's a lot of stuff in here, then maybe having the two separate sections is. Is fine. But I think if one link here might make it a little easier to understand.” -P8

>“I think that it's good that it's labeled separately because I think sometimes people are looking for that like paperless option” -P7

>“But then, I mean, I would still need that preference between text and email. So it being separate is a little bit wonky. Or like if say you had something that was completely paper notifications and you're not getting text or emails because you didn't already check that box.” -P7

>“I think paperless settings is kind of like a setting on its own… You opt in.” -P16

>(When asked what paperless delivery would apply to) “So I would say my notifications, my appointment notifications, my education status for GI Bill or VR and E or whatever. I'm using my messages from providers appointments.” -P11


### **Recommendation 9: Update the future design so it supports bulk selection.**

**Finding RQ11:** Some participants expressed that they would like the option to bulk select paperless option settings when interacting with the prototypes.

**Quotes:**

>“I'm assuming that each of these bold headers here would be other things too, like medical appointments, and so that they would have the option to. To shut that off or I would default it as off, actually.” -P8

>“There could probably be like an all paperless delivery and then maybe something that's like, if there's a specific form you want mailed to you, maybe go to that specific page. You know what I mean?” -P13

>“I think this is great that you give the options, but instead of having somebody having to check 18 of them or however many there are any. If you. Above Health care. You had make make all notifications or make, make, you know, switch to paperless delivery.” -P2


### **Recommendation 10: Change the wording on the paperless settings page to make it clear that Veterans can update their settings anytime.**

**Finding RQ7:** One participant wasn’t sure if they’d be able to change their preferences again after updating their settings.

**Quotes:**

>“Well, it says update saved with a check mark. Well, I. I feel pretty confident. But what I don't see here is what if I change my mind? I gotta go back to my father and he says, no, no, no, I want paper.” -P18


## **Additional Findings and Recommendations**

### **Login challenges create access barriers**

**Finding:** Some Veterans have difficulty signing into VA.gov, which can block access to digital documents.

>“Somehow I got locked out and I can't get back into it and I guess I gotta open up a whole new account and for some reason it won't take my phone number. ” - P9

**Recommendation:** Visit how the login experience can be improved for Veterans.


### **Strong interest in digital delivery**

**Finding:** The majority of participants expressed a high level of enthusiasm for opting into paperless mail options.****

>“You know, they need to catch up with the times.” - P4

>“They'll have somebody… print that all out, then send it to me in the mail, which, you know, that don't make sense to me when I can just go to … VA.gov” - P10

>“But then I get in the mail a week or so later, these little cards, and you open it, and I gripe every time I do, because I right now, I'm having quite a few appointments. It's postage wasted. I already know about the appointment.” -P3

**Recommendation:** Offer paperless delivery of all notifications, reminders, and documents


### **Desire for self serve documents**

**Finding:** Most participants who wanted paper documents would rather print them themselves than receive them by mail.

>“I print things out and bring them with me from the VA, because some of the medications have names that I'm not a doctor, so it's very hard to pronounce.” -P19

**Recommendation:** For all digital documents on VA.gov ensure that Veterans have the option to print.


### **Desire for comparable lab results**

**Finding:** One participant shared that they wanted to be able to compare their lab results online like they currently do with their physical copies.

>“So it's nice to be able to, like, literally look at my last one and this one and be like, hey, this level was high on both of them.” -P7

**Recommendation:** Provide a way for Veterans to view and compare their lab results online.


### **Desire to store documents not on** [**VA.gov**](http://va.gov)

**Finding:** Veterans often save important files outside of VA.gov for easier access or organization.

>“I will be working on scanning all of my papers in so that I can recycle them because they're taking up a lot of room, and I don't want that.” -P6

**Recommendation:** Provide a digital format for Veterans to download for all documents on [VA.gov](http://va.gov).


### **Need to share documents with trusted individuals**

**Finding:** Veterans want options to easily share VA documents with caregivers or family members.

>“I think it would be nice to develop a surrogacy for accessing an account. For example, I recently needed to access my husband's. Well, it takes his face... In order to access it.” -P3

**Recommendation:** Allow a way for one account to have multiple logins.\


### **Issues with mail delivery for transient individuals**

**Finding:** Veterans who move frequently or travel have trouble managing mailed documents.

>“I just came back… yesterday and… the mailman left a one of those plastic U S postal boxes next to my door filled with stuff. And a lot of it was, you know, stuff I just tossed immediately.” -P3

**Recommendation:** In addition to offering paperless delivery, also give people the option to schedule deliveries to different addresses at specific times.

**Fear of missing critical updates**

**Finding:** Some Veterans are concerned that if documents are only sent digitally, they may miss something important.

>“Discoverability of some documents online is… It can be really difficult. So you need some kind of clear communication. If you need me to do something, give me a link.” -P11

**Recommendation:** Create notifications and other alerts to inform Veterans of where there is new information and guide them to take action.


### **Preference for digital notifications**

**Finding:** Most Veterans want a text or email when new documents or updates are available on [VA.gov](http://va.gov).

>“Well, first of all, if you receive an email with good instructions, that's very beneficial.” - P6


**Recommendation:** Provide a text or email update for all changes on [VA.gov](http://va.gov) and stop sending paper notifications.

### **Confusion about the outcome of opting into notifications**

**Finding:** A number of Veterans believe they’re already signed up for paperless delivery, even when they’re not.

>“Yeah, I thought because I signed up for text and email notifications that they wouldn't send me mail about it” -P7

**Recommendation:** Clarify that opting in to text and email notifications is not the same as going paperless. You can get notified by text or email and continue to receive paper mail.


### **Desire to sign up for paperless delivery and paperless notifications at VA facilities.**

**Finding:** Some Veterans have tried to sign up for paperless delivery at VA facilities.

>“Yeah, even in the office, like when you go to see your doctor” - P6

>“Yeah, I thought because I signed up for text and email notifications that they wouldn't send me mail about it” -P7

**Recommendation:** Allow a way for representatives at facilities to update Veterans paperless notifications.


### **Validate speed of digital delivery**

**Finding:** Digital is seen as faster, but some worry the information might not be updated promptly.

>“Sometimes you'll get things quicker digitally than if it's mailed.” - P17

**Recommendation:** Start tracking how long it takes mail to get to a Veteran and use that information as a value proposition.


### **Communicate to Veterans who do not have a** [**VA.gov**](http://va.gov) **account**

**Finding:** One Veteran shared that he had many friends who did not know about the VA but who he believed were eligible for benefits.

>“A lot of members in the military do not know about the va, like legitimately. Those. They don't know that the VA exists even..” - P11

**Recommendation:** Find more ways to reach Veterans who do not have a [VA.gov](http://va.gov) account.
