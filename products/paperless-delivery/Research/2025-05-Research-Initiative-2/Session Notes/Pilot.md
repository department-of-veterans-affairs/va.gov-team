Participant# Pilot

Date 5/27/2025

Time 1:30 - 2:30 Eastern

test name Paperless Delivery


## **Intro - 5 minutes**

## **Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes**

1. First can you tell me if you have a VA.gov account?

   1. Yes

2) When do you log into your VA.gov account? What prompts you?

   1. When I need to refill a prescription, send message to a provider, used to check on statuses of a claim, help their wife and kids log into their account to look at education benefits.

3) Imagine you see a section on VA.gov called notification settings. What would you expect to be able to do in the section?

   1. The ability to toggle preferences for how I want to receive notifications I get from the VA. Hopefully he could see all of their notifications at once.

4) When you hear the terms paperless, paper-free, and digital online documents, what comes to mind? Can you describe how you would define each of them in your own words?

   1. Opting out of receiving something physical in the mail and it would be email or texted to you. 

   2. Could see it living in a notifications settings section but most definitely within their Profile.

   3. Paperless = without paper. They said this is the most common so they like this best. Likened it to paperless billing options for utilities, banks, etc. They would expect things by email. Things in the mail are at least a page so because of length that should probably be in an email rather than text. Too long for text. Test notifications should be short and just little reminders. Simple and short.

   4. Paper free = same thing as above but doesn’t sound as nice

   5. Digital online documents = something I can access online

5) Are there other similar terms or labels you you prefer above paperless, paper-free, or digital online documents?

   1. No, likes paperless best.

6) Can you tell me a little about how you typically receive important forms or communications? (e.g. through physical mail, email, etc.)

   1. Majority email

   2. Bought a new car = all over email

   3. House stuff = all over email


## **First Task: Feelings toward Digital Communication - 5 minutes**

### **Things to watch for:**

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would like to receive digitally

  - Wants to receive everything digitally.

  - Disability decision - a thick packet comes in the mail like a year after you apply. 

  - “Hey, this document/decision is ready to view” then people can just login to [va.gov](http://va.gov) to view them

  - COE for Home Loan - because they didn’t  have to wait for physical mail and could do it digitally they could process their home loan faster. Huge benefit for them.

  - Purchasing a vehicle: dealership was an hour away and just emailed the salesman back and forth and sent over all documents to sign. Saved them time and money. 

  - VA feels like a trusted source when it comes to security so they don’t feel worried about info being secure online. 

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would NOT like to receive digitally

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would like to continue receiving via paper.


## **Second Task: Existing Usability and Navigation Mental Models - 5 minutes**

### **Things to watch for:**

- Note the paths the participants took to update their delivery preferences.

  - Goes to Profile first > notification settings? Would need to the Notification settings box to be more explicit than it does now though  - needs to say more than text and email. Call out paper mail. Unless there is additional box to manage your paper settings.

  - Maybe you just opt out of paper mail rather than having a choice for email vs mail. But that does mean you would need to have an email.

- Note what words the participants were looking for (e.g. notifications/paperless/mail)

  - Paperless Settings

  - Opt out of paper mail 

- Did the participant seem confused when navigating to where they would imagine they would update their delivery preferences?

  - Was hesitant to immediately say Notifications Settings would be the place they would go.

- Did the participant’s expectations match our designs, how did they differ?


## **Third Task: Usability and Navigation \[Prototype] - 10 minutes**

### **Things to watch for:**

- Was the participant able to navigate to the paperless delivery preferences without assistance?

  - Sign in > Profile > noticed Communication Setting right away

  - Like the new verbiage. A lot more clear. Calls out paperless in the description. 

  - Clicked on paperless delivery settings

  - It was clear that they were not going to get a paper copy anymore, they would get it to their email.

  - Only applied to 1095-B at this point.

  - Love it is they were automatically opted into paperless delivery but worry about older Veterans. Would wonder how many Veterans have VA accounts but don’t have email addresses. How many people need the form wouldn’t get it because they don’t have an email. Just concerns with other people. Only auto opt in people with emails on file.

  - Likes when they unchecked is said Update Saved. Assumed they would get the physical mail now. Pretty confident in the setting with the Update Saved message. Would feel comfortable navigating away from this page afterwards.

  - They assume that their setting takes effect immediately

  - Incredibly easy  to use and navigate.

- Were they confident they were in the right place?

- Did they encounter any painpoints, frustrations or confusion?

- Was the participant able to update their delivery preferences to only receive forms digitally?

- Does the term “paperless” clearly communicate to the participant?

- Did they understand the copy associated with the radio button and check box?

  - Clarity is the same between the two for them.

  - Should we even give users the option to receive physical form if they have an email? Seems like there could be a case to be made that we shouldn’t to save more money for the VA.

  - Felt like the “Send me both” option caused some hesitancy. Rather than send me nothing, the radio is almost like send me MORE.

  - Prefers the first prototype.

- Were they confident that their changes had been saved?

- Did they expect confirmation of their changes? What type of confirmation?

- Did they prefer the radio buttons or checkbox design?

  - Checkbox


## **Post-Task Interview - 3 minutes**

- After seeing this prototype, is there anything that might make you hesitate or decide not to sign up for paperless delivery?

  - No

- If you had a magic wand and could make any changes to the way the VA communicates with you what would that be?

  - Keep going with what we’re doing - no more paper! Disability Claim Decisions to be made digital.

- Do you have any additional feedback on the process or terms we discussed today?
