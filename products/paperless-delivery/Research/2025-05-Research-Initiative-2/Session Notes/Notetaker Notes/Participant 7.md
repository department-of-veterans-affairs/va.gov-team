**Test name:** Paperless Delivery\
**Device:** Desktop\
**Prototype order:** Checkbox/radio button\

## **Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes**

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

1. First can you tell me if you have a VA.gov account?

   1. Using a Chrome on a laptop

   2. Yes they have an account

2. When do you log into your VA.gov account? What prompts you?

   1. When they got out of the military in 2022 or 2023 ish. Only logs in when they have to. Counter notes from appointments. Lab results from appointments.

   2. Usually an email notification that they have a message is when they log in.

   3. Secure messaging is the main reason they are logging in. They prefer that over calling.


## **First Task: Feelings toward Digital Communication - 5 minutes**

Interest in Digital Communications

- Are you interested in receiving all or some of your documents like the 1095-B tax document, decision letters, or other communications only digitally on VA.gov and not receiving paper copies by mail? Why or why not?

  - “Decision Letters drive me nuts.” Waste of paper. Decision letters are  papered. 99% of the time no action is needed by them. 

  - Keeps one: the actual decision with the appointment. 

  - They are making plans to scan all of the mail from the VA so they can have them all digitally and then recycle the paper.

  - The like getting labs on paper - easier to compare next to each other and they don’t come very often.

  - Appointment reminders are annoying too. They thought they chose not to get those but still do.

  - “I just feel bad about the paper honestly”

- Is there anything that would make you more likely to choose digital communication only and not receive paper mail?

  - A way to compare labs or filter for certain things. Can labs show comparison from past labs? 

Hesitation to Digital Forms

- Can you tell me a little about how you typically receive important forms or communications? (e.g. through physical mail, email, etc.)

  - A lot of their stuff is digital. Get very little paper. They think they’ve signed up for paperless with lots of business but they still get sent mail sometimes. Actively trying to sign up for paperless. 

- What made you feel confident or unsure about those experiences? (e.g. privacy, security, reliability, ease of access)

  - Unsure: they don’t want to miss something. You can’t really miss something you’re physically taking out of the mail

  - Confident: our info is out there already so it doesn’t bother them getting things digitally. It’s just more convenient and saves on paper.

- Are there any VA documents or other communication you would prefer to receive by physical mail vs only digitally on your VA.gov account? Why?

  - No, I don’t think so.

  - It would be nice if Community Care had an option to send the locations near you because. Hard to find in network providers for specialty clinics. Would like to get that mailed to them early. But that could also be sent digitally - just would worry they would miss that notification.

  - Email is busy and things can get lost in there. And they have multiple email addresses for different things. Text is better.

- Would you feel comfortable printing a copy yourself instead of having it mailed to you?

  - Yes. Many people might not have access to printers though. Library cost has gone up. 

- Do you have any concerns about switching to digital communication?

  - No. Just that they would want a text if they are getting emails. Want to be able to choose how they are getting notified.


### **Things to watch for:**

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would like to receive digitally

  -

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would NOT like to receive digitally

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would like to continue receiving via paper.


## **Second Task: Existing Usability and Navigation Mental Models - 5 minutes**

- If you wanted to control how a company sends you emails or texts — where would you navigate to control that? What kinds of settings would you look for?

  - Account Settings or Preferences. Top right of screen. Usually sub categories: contact info, contact preferences, etc.

  - Usually tool tips that you can use

  - Looks for “Contact Preferences”. “How do you want us to contact you?”

- If you wanted to control how a company sends you physical mail — where would you navigate to control that? What kinds of settings would you look for?

  - Would expect the same thing - under Contact Preferences. 

  - When they list the main thing like Account Settings. In finer print: change your address, etc. That content is helpful. Don’t want to be digging around trying to find where to go.

- Go ahead and log in to your VA.gov account. Now, talk me though where you’d expect to go and what you would expect to see to stop receiving the 1095-B tax form by mail. Please share your thoughts out loud. As you are navigating, if there is a section you would expect to exist, share what you are looking for out loud.

  - Would click their name in the top right. Then probably go to Profile.

  - They don’t even know what my VA is. Process of elimination to choose Profile Info.

  - There’s a 50/50 chance they would have clicked Contact Info rather than scrolling down to Notifications Preferences. Wants Notifications higher up. Why does Notifications need to be separate from Contact Information. They are connected.

  - Weird that it’s so far down.

  - Usually would see a “paperless” setting. Doesn’t seem to fit within the Notification Settings explicitly though.


## **Third Task: Usability and Navigation \[Prototype] - 10 minutes**

- We will now provide a prototype for you to interact with. This prototype has limited functionality so do not expect all buttons to work. As you navigate through the prototype please share any thoughts, frustrations, or points of confusion.

- Navigate to where you would expect to update your delivery preferences.

  - Sign In

  - Would click top right again - thinks there would be Account Settings there

  - Profile 

  - Still 50/50 would click on Contact Information or scroll down to Notification Settings

  - Likes Communication settings better. Likes that this one specifies paper. Likes the description. Makes things easier to find.

    - Wishes it were under Contact Information

  - Clicked Update paperless delivery settings

  - Difference between paperless and text/email notifications:

    - Email and text are categories of things like appointment notifications. Two checkboxes where you can check both for email and text or just one.

    - Paperless delivery would be more a catch all with some options

    - Likes that it’s labeled separately but it’s also kind of the same thing as notifications: Text, email, + a paper option. 

    - If they do enroll in paperless, they want to be able to select a notification preference: email or text.

    - They thought signing up for text/email notifications would stop physical mail but that’s not the case.

    - They want a text option. Even if the text is hey, you got an email. They miss emails.

- Based on what you see here, what delivery settings are selected for this account?

  - Paperless

- What documents would these settings apply to?

  - They thought it was everything paperless.

  - It would be nice to have options to pick and choose different things

- How do you feel about being auto opted in to paperless delivery?

  - Mixed feelings. Wants the option to select text. Opted in but not notified isn’t great. Wants to be able to customize settings for themselves.

- How would you define what ‘paperless settings’ are? (expected response: they will not receive mail but instead will access documents on [VA.gov](http://va.gov))

  - Digital. Really likes the language that they will be notified when new documents are added to paperless.

- Can you think of any other names that would make more sense to you than ‘paperless settings’?

  - Text, email, both or having an option to have a paper copy sent for specific things. 

- Now, imagine you would like to change your delivery preferences, talk me through how you would expect to do that.

  - Uncheck the box

- Update the prototype to receive paper mail.

- After updating your preferences, how confident do you feel that your changes have been saved?

  - Not very confident. Would expect a little pop up window.

- Optional - If participant expected a confirmation: Can you describe what steps you would take if you did not receive a confirmation?

  - Have the message stay on the screen longer.

- Now that you updated your preferences, how will you receive your 1095-B?

  -

- When do you think your updated preferences will start taking effect?

  - Immediately - ish

- How easy or difficult was it to interact with the prototype on your device?

  - Super simple

- I will now provide an alternative view (radio or checkbox) of the paperless delivery page for you to opt in to paperless delivery on.\

- Navigate to where you would expect to update your delivery preferences.

- Based on what you see here, what delivery settings are selected for this account?

  - Sign In > Still the drop down arrow to click Profile

  - Scroll down to same paperless delivery page

  - These options feel wonky - “Enrolled” language - I’m already enrolled by having that selected?

- Update the prototype to receive paper mail.

- How easy or difficult was it to interact with the prototype on your device?

  - Radio buttons are more clear because the two options are explicit. Shows which one you don’t have selected. Less room for someone to get lost.

- Did you notice any features that made it easier or harder for you to complete the tasks?

  - Radio vs checkbox

  - Might expect an email to be sent once preference are changed because VA likes to sent a lot of stuff.

- Which option did you prefer?

  - Preferred radio button


## **Post-Task Interview - 3 minutes**

- After seeing this prototype, is there anything that might make you hesitate or decide not to sign up for paperless delivery?

  -

- If you had a magic wand and could make any changes to the way the VA communicates with you what would that be?

  -

- Do you have any additional feedback on the process or terms we discussed today?
