# Participant #15 Notes

**Date:** 6/13/2025\
**Time:** 4:00pm - 4:45pm Eastern\
**Test name:** Paperless Delivery\
**Device:** Desktop\
**Prototype Order:** Radio/Checkbox\

## **Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes**

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

1. What device will you be using today?

   1. ipad

2. What browser are you using?

   1. Chrome

3. First can you tell me if you have a VA.gov account?

   1. Yes

4. When do you log into your VA.gov account? What prompts you?

   1. When they have an appointment coming up


## **First Task: Feelings toward Digital Communication - 5 minutes**

Interest in Digital Communications

- Are you interested in receiving all or some of your documents like the 1095-B tax document, decision letters, or other communications only digitally on VA.gov and not receiving paper copies by mail? Why or why not?

  - Yes, prefers digital. Because he can save it and continue to reference it. Doesn’t want to waste paper. Saves things locally on his machine.

- Is there anything that would make you more likely to choose digital communication only and not receive paper mail?

  - He thinks he’s already switched over to all digital for anything - VA or otherwise

  - He thinks he opted in to electronic delivery for a couple things.

Hesitation to Digital Forms

- Can you tell me a little about how you typically receive important forms or communications? (e.g. through physical mail, email, etc.)

  - Via email or gets an email notification to log in and check something

- What made you feel confident or unsure about those experiences? (e.g. privacy, security, reliability, ease of access)

  - He used to work in IT so digital has always been his preference. Likes having full control of how to access things and how and where he can save and store things.

  - Nothing has made him feel unsure.

- Are there any VA documents or other communication you would prefer to receive by physical mail vs only digitally on your VA.gov account? Why?

  - No

- Would you feel comfortable printing a copy yourself instead of having it mailed to you?

  - Yes, he does that now.

- Do you have any concerns about switching to digital communication?

  - No


### **Things to watch for:**

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would like to receive digitally

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would NOT like to receive digitally

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would like to continue receiving via paper.


## **Second Task: Existing Usability and Navigation Mental Models - 5 minutes**

- If you wanted to control how a company sends you emails or texts — where would you navigate to control that? What kinds of settings would you look for?

  - Settings > Communications > Sub categories for text, electronic, paper

- If you wanted to control how a company sends you physical mail — where would you navigate to control that? What kinds of settings would you look for?

  - Same place > how do you want to receive a document: electronically or by mail

- Go ahead and log in to your VA.gov account. Now, talk me though where you’d expect to go and what you would expect to see to stop receiving the 1095-B tax form by mail. Please share your thoughts out loud. As you are navigating, if there is a section you would expect to exist, share what you are looking for out loud.

  - Logged into the app first

  - Clicked Go to Profile > scrolling through the hub

  - Went into Contact Information first

  - Went to Direct Deposit next. Didn’t try to go to Notification settings.

  - Trying to look for tax stuff or digital/physical language

  - He wants to be able to find it in the profile hub under Contact Information maybe. But also wants a new section for it: “opt in / opt out”


## **Third Task: Usability and Navigation \[Prototype] - 10 minutes**

- We will now provide a prototype for you to interact with. This prototype has limited functionality so do not expect all buttons to work. As you navigate through the prototype please share any thoughts, frustrations, or points of confusion.

- Navigate to where you would expect to update your delivery preferences.

  - Scrolled home page before signing in. Looking for electronic or physical. Needed to be prompted to sign in

  - Went to Profile right away again

  - Chose to land on Communication Settings because he saw “update paperless delivery”

- Based on what you see here, what delivery settings are selected for this account?

  - Paper mail for all of them

- What documents would these settings apply to?

  - Correctly answered

- How do you feel about being auto opted in to paperless delivery?

  - He wants the option. He likes to make his own decisions.

- How would you define what ‘paperless settings’ are? (expected response: they will not receive mail but instead will access documents on [VA.gov](http://va.gov))

  - The method of delivery - electronic or physical delivery

- How would you define what notification settings are?

  - An alert system based on what you want to be notified on.

- What’s the difference between notifications and paperless?

  - Notification - if he’s using the app it let him know that he has something waiting for him to check

  -

- Can you think of any other names that would make more sense to you than ‘paperless settings’?

  - No

- Now, imagine you would like to change your delivery preferences, talk me through how you would expect to do that.

  - Took a minute to find it on the page.

  - Selected the opt in radio button

- Update the prototype to receive paper mail.

- After updating your preferences, how confident do you feel that your changes have been saved?

  - Confident because he saw the alert on the screen. Might also want an email that his preferences have been updated.

- Optional - If participant expected a confirmation: Can you describe what steps you would take if you did not receive a confirmation?

  -

- Now that you updated your preferences, how will you receive your 1095-B?

  - Paperless delivery.

- When do you think your updated preferences will start taking effect?

  - Immediately

- How easy or difficult was it to interact with the prototype on your device?

  - Easy

- I will now provide an alternative view (radio or checkbox) of the paperless delivery page for you to opt in to paperless delivery on.\

- Navigate to where you would expect to update your delivery preferences.

- Based on what you see here, what delivery settings are selected for this account?

  - Nothing is selected

  - Correctly updated setting

- Update the prototype to receive paper mail.

- How easy or difficult was it to interact with the prototype on your device?

  - Easy

- Did you notice any features that made it easier or harder for you to complete the tasks?

  - Radio buttons were already selected and he liked that

- Which option did you prefer?

  - Radio buttons

- Third prototype (consolidated check boxes)

  - Still likes the radio buttons because there is a setting already selected (paper selected)

  - Radio buttons are more clear to him

  - Feels like there are too many boxes for the check boxes. Not intuitive that unchecking the box means they are getting paper.


## **Post-Task Interview - 3 minutes**

- After seeing this prototype, is there anything that might make you hesitate or decide not to sign up for paperless delivery?

  - No

- If you had a magic wand and could make any changes to the way the VA communicates with you what would that be?

  - Nothing right now.

- Do you have any additional feedback on the process or terms we discussed today?
