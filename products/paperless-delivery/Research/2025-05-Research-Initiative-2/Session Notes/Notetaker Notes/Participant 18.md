# Participant #18 Notes

**Date:** 6/10/2025\
**Time:** 12:00pm - 12:45pm Eastern\
**Test name:** Paperless Delivery\
**Device:** Laptop\
**Prototype Order:** Radio/Checkbox\

## **Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes**

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

1. What device will you be using today?

   1. Mac laptop

2. What browser are you using?

   1. Chrome

3. First can you tell me if you have a VA.gov account?

   1. She is a caregiver. Handles all of his medical and financial things.

   2. She logs in and puts in claims.

   3. Her father’s account. Very private about it so will not be screen sharing that account.

   4. She doesn’t live with her father so it’s much easier to do things digitally - she can’t go over to his house all the time to collect and see mail. She feels much more secure when she is getting things online because of this.

4. When do you log into your VA.gov account? What prompts you?

   1. Upcoming doctor appointments, change an appointment, a question she has regarding medications. 

   2. She is pretty comfortable doing all of these things online - claims, uploads, prescriptions


## **First Task: Feelings toward Digital Communication - 5 minutes**

Interest in Digital Communications

- Are you interested in receiving all or some of your documents like the 1095-B tax document, decision letters, or other communications only digitally on VA.gov and not receiving paper copies by mail? Why or why not?

  - Yes. She can print things if she needs to but no reason to receive physical copies.

- Is there anything that would make you more likely to choose digital communication only and not receive paper mail?

  - She thinks she already signed up for paperless. She can’t remember the last time she received a paper.

  - She doesn’t quite know if her father receives paper because she doesn’t know about it - doesn’t live with him.

Hesitation to Digital Forms

- Can you tell me a little about how you typically receive important forms or communications? (e.g. through physical mail, email, etc.)

  - Gas and electric bill are all online. They have been slowly going digital over the last few years.

- What made you feel confident or unsure about those experiences? (e.g. privacy, security, reliability, ease of access)

  - Hasn’t had a negative experience yet. Likes that they are set up with direct deposit on things - social security, VA.

- Are there any VA documents or other communication you would prefer to receive by physical mail vs only digitally on your VA.gov account? Why?

  - She doesn’t know. He probably prefers paper because that’s what he is used to but digital makes her life easier.

  - She saves important documents on her computer: diagnosis, lab results, etc.

- Would you feel comfortable printing a copy yourself instead of having it mailed to you?

  - Yes. She has a printer at home and feels comfortable doing that.

- Do you have any concerns about switching to digital communication?

  - No.


### **Things to watch for:**

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would like to receive digitally

  -

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would NOT like to receive digitally

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would like to continue receiving via paper.


## **Second Task: Existing Usability and Navigation Mental Models - 5 minutes**

- If you wanted to control how a company sends you emails or texts — where would you navigate to control that? What kinds of settings would you look for?

  - Go to her Account/Profile > Settings > Email Notifications or Text Notifications 

- If you wanted to control how a company sends you physical mail — where would you navigate to control that? What kinds of settings would you look for?

  - Same place as above, in Settings > Paperless or Paper with a box that you check > make sure they have the correct address

- Go ahead and log in to your VA.gov account. Now, talk me though where you’d expect to go and what you would expect to see to stop receiving the 1095-B tax form by mail. Please share your thoughts out loud. As you are navigating, if there is a section you would expect to exist, share what you are looking for out loud.

  - Scrolled down the My VA page to check before going to Profile > Looking for something called “Documents” > looked in the footer

  - Profile > looking for something about “Documents”

  - Under Notification Settings


## **Third Task: Usability and Navigation \[Prototype] - 10 minutes**

- We will now provide a prototype for you to interact with. This prototype has limited functionality so do not expect all buttons to work. As you navigate through the prototype please share any thoughts, frustrations, or points of confusion.

- Navigate to where you would expect to update your delivery preferences.

  - Needed to be prompted to sign in > Wanted to go to Records before signing in > Also wanted to click Get started with VA

  - Signed in > Profile > Communication settings > she saw paperless delivery

    - Communication is more clear

    - Paperless delivery link is clear too

- What is the difference between notifications vs paperless settings?

  - Notifications: you need to update something - notifying her of something she needs to do

  - Paperless: we’ve sent you a benefit statement

- Based on what you see here, what delivery settings are selected for this account?

  - She said this page is exactly what she would expect, the choice to pick what is paperless

  - Everything is set to receive paper right now.

- What documents would these settings apply to?

  - Accurately knew what documents had the option to be paperless

- How do you feel about being auto opted in to paperless delivery?

  - She doesn’t like that, she wants to choose

- How would you define what ‘paperless settings’ are? (expected response: they will not receive mail but instead will access documents on [VA.gov](http://va.gov))

  -

- Can you think of any other names that would make more sense to you than ‘paperless settings’?

  - No. It’s familiar to her with other things - bank accounts

- Now, imagine you would like to change your delivery preferences, talk me through how you would expect to do that.

  - Clicked the opt-in to paperless option.

- Update the prototype to receive paper mail.

- After updating your preferences, how confident do you feel that your changes have been saved?

  - It says Update Saved so she feels pretty confident in that.

  - But she doesn’t see a place to edit if she changes her mind - prompted to try again. She is familiar with seeing an edit or pencil icon.

- Optional - If participant expected a confirmation: Can you describe what steps you would take if you did not receive a confirmation?

  -

- Now that you updated your preferences, how will you receive your 1095-B?

  - Paperlessly

  - She would also expect to receive an email about her preferences being updated.

- When do you think your updated preferences will start taking effect?

  - As soon as they issue the 1095-B

- How easy or difficult was it to interact with the prototype on your device?

  - Very easy

- I will now provide an alternative view (radio or checkbox) of the paperless delivery page for you to opt in to paperless delivery on.\

- Navigate to where you would expect to update your delivery preferences.

  - Went straight to Communication > Paperless  Settings

- Based on what you see here, what delivery settings are selected for this account?

  - Nothing is selected - she would assume everything is paper because of that.

- Update the prototype to receive paper mail.

  - Wouldn’t do anything to receive paper mail - already unchecked. 

  - Checked the box to enroll in paperless

- How easy or difficult was it to interact with the prototype on your device?

  - Easy

- Did you notice any features that made it easier or harder for you to complete the tasks?

  - This is shorter, she likes it better. Seems easier to read

- Which option did you prefer?

  - Checkboxes

  - She likes the third version even better. This option seems the clearest - she likes the direction about checking the boxes to enroll in paperless. Loves the instructions.

  - She saw option four but still likes option 3 better - each section with the instructions


## **Post-Task Interview - 3 minutes**

- After seeing this prototype, is there anything that might make you hesitate or decide not to sign up for paperless delivery?

  - Not at all, no. In fact it would make it easier to sign up for paperless

- If you had a magic wand and could make any changes to the way the VA communicates with you what would that be?

  - Pick up the phone - it’s really hard to get someone on the phone when she needs something

- Do you have any additional feedback on the process or terms we discussed today?

  - No. She likes the words “paperless delivery”. There’s no guess work.

6.10 / Participant 18 - notes:

- “He has too much paper…I”m done with that, too much paper. I don’t live with him, so it’s much easier to handle at my laptop or phone. The mail collects, and I can’t always tell…what happens to it. I feel much more secure if I get it online. If the VA is contacting him about his benefits, if he’s getting his payments….If it’s paper, I can’t control it.”

- “All his bills are auto-pay now…He resisted at first, but we started slowly...I’ve gotten him used to the idea that these things make life less complicated for him.”

- Interested in receiving all her father’s documents digitally. Can print/scan at home if needed.

- He doesn’t receive VA mail often, and, if he does, she doesn’t necessarily know about it. This is why she’s more comfortable with paperless.

- To look for paperless settings: “Would go to my account and profile settings or something like that.”

  - “Would look for my address..make sure has my right address.”

- Staging walk-through:

  - Looked through MyVA page first for the settings. “Looking for something that says ‘Documents.’”

  - Then, clicked “Go to your profile” under the MyVA heading. “What I’m looking for is something about documents.”

  - Would expect to see it under “Notification Settings.”

- Figma walk-through:

  - Maybe look under “Records” for delivery settings

  - “I think I would have to sign in \[to see address, etc.]”

  - When signed-in, would look at “Communication settings.”

    - Much better because it clearly says “Communication settings,” then the specific “paperless” option.

  - Notifications tell “something you need to pay attention to.” Paperless is “we’ve sent you a benefits statement.”

  - Paperless delivery options - “Exactly what I would expect to see.”

  - \*\*\* Don’t like being auto-opted into paperless delivery; prefer to choose.

  - Clear on what “paperless delivery” means because has seen it from other places (e.g., bank).

  - \*\*\* “Don’t see a place to edit \[the selection]…I’m not sure ‘if I could change it again.’...Was expecting a pencil or something, but this is easy.”

  - Expect to start taking the selection to take effect “as soon as they issue the 1095-B.”

  - Would expect to receive an email to say “you have selected paperless delivery for…” Has access to her father’s email, which she checks almost daily.

  - Liked the direct access to paperless delivery settings from homepage; “shorter and easier to read.”

• ⁃ \*\*\* Liked the “Select paperless delivery by checking the boxes…” even better. “This is the clearest.”
