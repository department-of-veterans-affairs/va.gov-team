# Participant #1 Notes

**Date:** 5/28/2025\
**Time:** 1:00 - 1:45 Eastern\
**Test name:** Paperless Delivery\
**Device:** Desktop\
**Prototype order:** checkbox then radio button\

## **Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes**

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

1. First can you tell me if you have a VA.gov account?

2. When do you log into your VA.gov account? What prompts you?

   1. Had an account for a while when it first became available

   2. Every week she logs in for secure messaging with VA health providers

   3. She uses Duck Duck Go browser. Uses apple tablet + laptop to log ing.


## **First Task: Feelings toward Digital Communication - 5 minutes**

Interest in Digital Communications

- Are you interested in receiving all or some of your documents like the 1095-B tax document, decision letters, or other communications only digitally on VA.gov and not receiving paper copies by mail? Why or why not?

  - They live in a very rural area and mail delivery can be extremely slow. Digital is just way faster. Mail delivery is also often mis-delivered where they live.

- Is there anything that would make you more likely to choose digital communication only and not receive paper mail?

  - They like to travel a lot so it would be nice if they didn’t have to rely on physical mail. [Va.gov](http://va.gov) should give you the option of how you want to receive it.

Hesitation to Digital Forms

- Can you tell me a little about how you typically receive important forms or communications? (e.g. through physical mail, email, etc.)

  - They try to sign up for digital if it's available because of their schedule.

- What made you feel confident or unsure about those experiences? (e.g. privacy, security, reliability, ease of access)

  - Water bills are all electronic, automatic payment. Bank statements are all electronic. Also likes that there isn’t PII like mail getting misplaced. 

  - Secure symbol makes them feel confident when clicking on a link

- Are there any VA documents or other communication you would prefer to receive by physical mail vs only digitally on your VA.gov account? Why?

  - Not really, no. They can just print it out themselves if they need a physical form. 

- Would you feel comfortable printing a copy yourself instead of having it mailed to you?

  - Very confident.

- Do you have any concerns about switching to digital communication?

  - No. Full stop.


### **Things to watch for:**

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would like to receive digitally

  -

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would NOT like to receive digitally

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would like to continue receiving via paper.


## **Second Task: Existing Usability and Navigation Mental Models - 5 minutes**

- If you wanted to control how a company sends you emails or texts — where would you navigate to control that? What kinds of settings would you look for?

  - Preferences in settings - hard copy, email, or both options. They usually only check the email option. 

  - They would expect those preferences to be called “Notification Preferences” - “Communications - how do you want to receive them?”

- If you wanted to control how a company sends you physical mail — where would you navigate to control that? What kinds of settings would you look for?

  - Same place mentioned above. They would expect to find it in the same place. If they did select hard copy for a setting they would expect to be able to input an mailing address of their choice.

- Go ahead and log in to your VA.gov account. Now, talk me though where you’d expect to go and what you would expect to see to stop receiving the 1095-B tax form by mail. Please share your thoughts out loud. As you are navigating, if there is a section you would expect to exist, share what you are looking for out loud.

  - Goes to My HealtheVet weekly. Immediately went there when they logged in.

  - When to Profile > said Contact Information but went to Notification settings

  - They would expect to find it in Notification settings.

  - Assumed that there was already an option to receive things not my mail because of the options on the Notification settings page.


## **Third Task: Usability and Navigation \[Prototype] - 10 minutes**

- We will now provide a prototype for you to interact with. This prototype has limited functionality so do not expect all buttons to work. As you navigate through the prototype please share any thoughts, frustrations, or points of confusion.

- Navigate to where you would expect to update your delivery preferences.

  - Clicked sign in unprompted

  - Landed on My VA page > clicked Profile immediately

  - Communication settings - read through everything and saw paperless so clicked there. The other one is just updating your preferences but this one is more clearly “get less mail”

- Based on what you see here, what delivery settings are selected for this account?

- What documents would these settings apply to?

  - Just the 1095-B

- How do you feel about being auto opted in to paperless delivery?

  - As long as there is a selection to opt out, that’s fine. Some places want original docs because digital can be edited

- How would you define what ‘paperless settings’ are? (expected response: they will not receive mail but instead will access documents on [VA.gov](http://va.gov))

  - Not going to get a piece of mail. Likes the name. Doesn’t want another name.

- Can you think of any other names that would make more sense to you than ‘paperless settings’?

  - No

- Now, imagine you would like to change your delivery preferences, talk me through how you would expect to do that.

  - Uncheck, easy.

- Update the prototype to recieve paper mail.

- After updating your preferences, how confident do you feel that your changes have been saved?

  - Confident. How would you would confirm that your changes have been saved?

- Optional - If participant expected a confirmation: Can you describe what steps you would take if you did not receive a confirmation?

  - Saw that it said changes had been saved. They would log out, log back in and make sure it saved the setting. If the box isn’t checked, they know they will get a paper document.

- Now that you updated your preferences how will you recieve your 1095-B?

  - Piece of paper in the mail.

- When do you think your updated preferences will start taking effect?

  - Within 1 - 2 days. The next time they send it out. Doesn’t expect any communications but some places do send a message that they’ve updated their preferences.

- How easy or difficult was it to interact with the prototype on your device?

  - Very easy.

- I will now provide an alternative view (radio or checkbox) of the paperless delivery page for you to opt in to paperless delivery on.\

- Navigate to where you would expect to update your delivery preferences.

- Based on what you see here, what delivery settings are selected for this account?

  - Went to paperless page again no problem.

- Update the prototype to receive paper mail.

- How easy or difficult was it to interact with the prototype on your device?

  - Extremely easy. Still seemed straightforward to them.

- Did you notice any features that made it easier or harder for you to complete the tasks?

  - Preferred this version because it explicitly said you will get a paper copy. Some people are going to want both. 

  - The other one was getting digital OR paper, this one is digital only OR paper AND digital

- Which option did you prefer?

  - Radio buttons


## **Post-Task Interview - 3 minutes**

- After seeing this prototype, is there anything that might make you hesitate or decide not to sign up for paperless delivery?

  - No

- If you had a magic wand and could make any changes to the way the VA communicates with you what would that be?

  - More paperless!

  - Hard copies of appointment reminders even though they already get them digitally.

- Do you have any additional feedback on the process or terms we discussed today?

  - No.
