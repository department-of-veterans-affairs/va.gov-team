**Prototype order:** checkbox then radio button


## **Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes**

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

1. First can you tell me if you have a VA.gov account?

- **Has VA.gov account:** Yes

2. When do you log into your VA.gov account? What prompts you?

   - **Login triggers:**

     - Previously every other day when husband was alive

     - Now once a week dealing with survivor benefits after husband's passing (few months ago)

     - Uses for her own benefits, HealtheVet

     - Her husband was 100% disabled veteran, not her

     - **Device/Browser:** Laptop, Chrome


## **First Task: Feelings toward Digital Communication - 5 minutes**

Interest in Digital Communications

- Are you interested in receiving all or some of your documents like the 1095-B tax document, decision letters, or other communications only digitally on VA.gov and not receiving paper copies by mail? Why or why not?

**Interest in receiving documents digitally:** EVERYTHING - "Everything should be digital - never tell me it's in the mail. I want EVERYTHING. I'm done."

**Why:** "Interested in receiving digital stuff, right then and there, instead of waiting on a piece of mail"

**Current frustrations:**

- Husband's death benefits: Called to report death, they wanted documents, then sent letter saying benefits would end March 1st - "it was a hot mess"

- DIC benefits: Been waiting since March 20th, still on step 2

- "I'm going to be homeless by the time I get the documents..."

* Is there anything that would make you more likely to choose digital communication only and not receive paper mail?

  - Speed: "Just put it online, and it would be quicker" - "They need to catch up with the times"

Hesitation to Digital Forms

- Can you tell me a little about how you typically receive important forms or communications? (e.g. through physical mail, email, etc.)

  - **How you receive important forms/communications:** Email for most important documents, everyday bills, non-VA doctors

  - **Problems:** "I only have problems with VA. I'm fed up with it. They're slow.

* What made you feel confident or unsure about those experiences? (e.g. privacy, security, reliability, ease of access)

  - **Privacy/Security/Reliability concerns:** Not worried about security

  - Environmental benefit: "less trees"

  - Sees "lock on the bottom"

  - Speed advantage: "instead of 5-7 days in the mail, put it in an email"

- Are there any VA documents or other communication you would prefer to receive by physical mail vs only digitally on your VA.gov account? Why?

  - None - wants everything digital

* Would you feel comfortable printing a copy yourself instead of having it mailed to you?

  - Would expect others might need this option: "for some people who can't just print it out!" She can however.

* Do you have any concerns about switching to digital communication?

  - None for herself, but "Consider older vets”


### **Things to watch for:**

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would like to receive digitally

  - **EVERYTHING** - all VA communications

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would NOT like to receive digitally

  - None

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would like to continue receiving via paper.

  - None


## **Second Task: Existing Usability and Navigation Mental Models - 5 minutes**

- If you wanted to control how a company sends you emails or texts — where would you navigate to control that? What kinds of settings would you look for?

  - Under user name dropdown → settings → step by step options

  - Doesn’t want checkboxes to select preferences: "Would you prefer paper or electronic? I don’t want a bunch of boxes to check” wants a single option

- If you wanted to control how a company sends you physical mail — where would you navigate to control that? What kinds of settings would you look for?

  - Same location expectation

* Go ahead and log in to your VA.gov account. Now, talk me though where you’d expect to go and what you would expect to see to stop receiving the 1095-B tax form by mail. Please share your thoughts out loud. As you are navigating, if there is a section you would expect to exist, share what you are looking for out loud.

  - **Primary expectation:** Under user name dropdown → settings → step by step

  - **Second thought when diving in:** Profile → Notifications Settings

  - **Initial confusion:** Expected something under her name that should say "paperless"

  - Initially looked for paperless options under her name/letters section

  - Had to reconsider and think about Profile section


## **Third Task: Usability and Navigation \[Prototype] - 10 minutes**

- We will now provide a prototype for you to interact with. This prototype has limited functionality so do not expect all buttons to work. As you navigate through the prototype please share any thoughts, frustrations, or points of confusion.

- Navigate to where you would expect to update your delivery preferences.

**Path taken:** Sign in (upper right corner, uses Login.gov) → Name → initially looked at letters → Profile → Communication Settings

**Recognition:** Saw "Paperless" under Communication Settings

- Based on what you see here, what delivery settings are selected for this account?

  - 1095-B

* What documents would these settings apply to?

  - **Scope limitation concern:** "This isn't solving her problem that everything should be \[paperless]"

  - **Current scope:** Only 1095-B form - "Don't tell me about 1095-B, everything paperless, opt in or out"

  - **Desired scope:** "Everything I get from VA would become paperless"

- How do you feel about being auto opted in to paperless delivery?

  - **Personal preference:** "I wouldn't mind if I could just opt in"

  - **Concern for others:** "others might though. Consider older vets, who can't read all that stuff"

* How would you define what ‘paperless settings’ are? (expected response: they will not receive mail but instead will access documents on [VA.gov](http://va.gov))

  - "Everything in an email or text or anything" - "common sense, you either opt in and out"

- Can you think of any other names that would make more sense to you than ‘paperless settings’?

  - "Paperless Settings"

  - "Paperless Delivery"

* Now, imagine you would like to change your delivery preferences, talk me through how you would expect to do that.

  - Simple opt in/out approach

  - "Opt in or out"

- Update the prototype to receive paper mail.

  - **Unchecking logic:** "I'd uncheck it if I want paper in the mail" but notes "Unchecking is too much for people"

* After updating your preferences, how confident do you feel that your changes have been saved?

  - **Uncertainty:** "50% chance it's applied. I'd have to log in or log out just to confirm it's right"

  - **Desired confirmation:** Expects email confirmation - "I'd expect an email to be sent to me that says I'd be opt into paperless - then I'd be 100% sure it worked!"

- Optional - If participant expected a confirmation: Can you describe what steps you would take if you did not receive a confirmation?

  - Understood would receive paper mail after unchecking

* Now that you updated your preferences, how will you receive your 1095-B?

  - **Timeline expectation:** "Would expect it to start taking effect in 24 hours"

  -

* When do you think your updated preferences will start taking effect?

  - "It was easy, but needs to be changed to opt in or out"

  -

* I will now provide an alternative view (radio or checkbox) of the paperless delivery page for you to opt in to paperless delivery on.

  - **Version 2 preference:** "I like the 2nd option more but need our 3rd choice"

  - **Wants 3rd option:** Paper only option "for some people who can't just print it out!"

  - **Confusion about version 2:** "Confused about paper and digital copies, why isn't there a paper only"

  - **Overall:** "I like that version the best" (referring to version 2 with suggested paper-only addition and radio buttons)

- Navigate to where you would expect to update your delivery preferences.

- Based on what you see here, what delivery settings are selected for this account?

  -

- Update the prototype to receive paper mail.

- How easy or difficult was it to interact with the prototype on your device?

  -

- Did you notice any features that made it easier or harder for you to complete the tasks?

  - **Missing paper-only option** in current designs

  - **Scope too narrow:** Wants one big bucket for everything, not individual forms

- Which option did you prefer?

  - Version 2 with addition of paper-only option radio


## **Post-Task Interview - 3 minutes**

- After seeing this prototype, is there anything that might make you hesitate or decide not to sign up for paperless delivery?

  - None - "I would sign up for paperless delivery, I think this is best"

  -

- If you had a magic wand and could make any changes to the way the VA communicates with you what would that be?

  - **For VA:** "Stop firing everybody"

  - **Personal:** "I just want to get my documents a lot quicker"

  -

- Do you have any additional feedback on the process or terms we discussed today?

  - "The VA needs all the help it can get"

  - Strong frustration with current mail-based system causing delays in critical survivor benefits
