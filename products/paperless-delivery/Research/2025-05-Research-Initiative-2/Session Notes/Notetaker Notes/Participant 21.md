# Participant #21 Notes

**Date:** 6/11/2025\
**Time:** 4:00pm - 4:45pm Eastern\
**Test name:** Paperless Delivery\
**Device:** Desktop/Laptop\
**Prototype Order:** Checkbox/Radio

## **Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes**

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

1. What device will you be using today?

   1. Dell Laptop

2. What browser are you using?

   1. Chrome

3. First can you tell me if you have a VA.gov account?

   1. Yes they do

4. When do you log into your VA.gov account? What prompts you?

   1. To order meds, check appointments, send messages to provider

   2. Prompted when he starts running out of meds. Reminder things mostly. Doesn’t rely on emails for those log ins.


## **First Task: Feelings toward Digital Communication - 5 minutes**

Interest in Digital Communications

- Are you interested in receiving all or some of your documents like the 1095-B tax document, decision letters, or other communications only digitally on VA.gov and not receiving paper copies by mail? Why or why not?

  - Yes. He’s accidentally thrown away checks before. Doesn’t have great experience keeping track of mail.

- Is there anything that would make you more likely to choose digital communication only and not receive paper mail?

  - No. But concerned for older Veterans

Hesitation to Digital Forms

- Can you tell me a little about how you typically receive important forms or communications? (e.g. through physical mail, email, etc.)

  - Email, IMs at work

  - But registration stickers for a boat have to be mailed, can’t be digital

- What made you feel confident or unsure about those experiences? (e.g. privacy, security, reliability, ease of access)

  - Confident: It’s the trend now, it’s what everyone is doing. Doesn’t think he can screw things up that bad.

  - Unsure: if it’s too complicated he will get frustrated and close out

- Are there any VA documents or other communication you would prefer to receive by physical mail vs only digitally on your VA.gov account? Why?

  - Probably  not. Doesn’t really use his benefit letters. Does get paper appointment reminders but those can be digital. He would be fine switching over to digital.

- Would you feel comfortable printing a copy yourself instead of having it mailed to you?

  - Yes

- Do you have any concerns about switching to digital communication?

  - He doesn’t think so. Sometimes there are kinks in digital ways (system down) but it’s becoming more rare.


### **Things to watch for:**

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would like to receive digitally

  -

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would NOT like to receive digitally

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would like to continue receiving via paper.


## **Second Task: Existing Usability and Navigation Mental Models - 5 minutes**

- If you wanted to control how a company sends you emails or texts — where would you navigate to control that? What kinds of settings would you look for?

  - My Account/Profile > Settings > Preferences > Notifications/Communication

- If you wanted to control how a company sends you physical mail — where would you navigate to control that? What kinds of settings would you look for?

  - My Accounts > something to do with “Personal” which would have their address. “Billing”

- How do you define Notifications

  - When and what will be sent to you

- How do you define Paperless

  - No paper in the mail anymore

- Go ahead and log in to your VA.gov account. Now, talk me though where you’d expect to go and what you would expect to see to stop receiving the 1095-B tax form by mail. Please share your thoughts out loud. As you are navigating, if there is a section you would expect to exist, share what you are looking for out loud.

  - Name drop down > Profile

  - Notification settings

  - Looking for another header for paper

  - List of things that are currently being mailed

  - He said that he had never been to the Notifications page before

- Difference between document and reminder?

  - Reminder: something that pops up like a calendar reminder

  - Document: physical piece of paper or something you could see online. Comprehensive thing with lots of detail.


## **Third Task: Usability and Navigation \[Prototype] - 10 minutes**

- We will now provide a prototype for you to interact with. This prototype has limited functionality so do not expect all buttons to work. As you navigate through the prototype please share any thoughts, frustrations, or points of confusion.

- Navigate to where you would expect to update your delivery preferences.

  -

- Based on what you see here, what delivery settings are selected for this account?

  - None - all boxes unchecked

- What documents would these settings apply to?

  -

- How do you feel about being auto opted in to paperless delivery?

  -

- How would you define what ‘paperless settings’ are? (expected response: they will not receive mail but instead will access documents on [VA.gov](http://va.gov))

  -

- Can you think of any other names that would make more sense to you than ‘paperless settings’?

  -

- Now, imagine you would like to change your delivery preferences, talk me through how you would expect to do that.

  -

- Update the prototype to receive paper mail.

  - Found taxes > checked box for 1095-B

- After updating your preferences, how confident do you feel that your changes have been saved?

  - 90% confident. Would think it saves pretty instant. Nothing explaining otherwise. Tried looking for a save button. 

- Optional - If participant expected a confirmation: Can you describe what steps you would take if you did not receive a confirmation?

  - Move away from the page and go back to the page to see if the selection stuck.

- Now that you updated your preferences, how will you receive your 1095-B?

  - Via email or text.

- When do you think your updated preferences will start taking effect?

  - Immediately. But it could depend document by document. If something is on a monthly cycle it might happen not this month but next month. Would prefer communication on when his preferences would take effect: via text or email.

- How easy or difficult was it to interact with the prototype on your device?

  - Relatively easy

- I will now provide an alternative view (radio or checkbox) of the paperless delivery page for you to opt in to paperless delivery on.\

- Navigate to where you would expect to update your delivery preferences.

  - Sign In > tired to click name drop down to go to Profile

  - Communication Settings > Manage email and text 

  - Didn’t look or read the paperless settings link. Missed it. Once it was called to his attention he would rather go there.

- Based on what you see here, what delivery settings are selected for this account?

  - Receive paper for everything

  - Thinks the documents were Healthcare, benefits, etc.

  - He is fine if he is auto opted in. But concerned for other people.

  - Can’t think of a better name or words for “paperless”. Likes it.

- Update the prototype to receive paper mail.

  - Checked the paperless radio button option

  - Still only feels 90% confident on his selection saving.

- How easy or difficult was it to interact with the prototype on your device?

  - Relatively easy

- Did you notice any features that made it easier or harder for you to complete the tasks?

  - No. Didn’t exactly not notice the radio vs. checkboxes change. 

- Which option did you prefer?

  - Radio buttons. Feels like “go paperless” checkbox is busy. Seems too fancy and technical.


## **Post-Task Interview - 3 minutes**

- After seeing this prototype, is there anything that might make you hesitate or decide not to sign up for paperless delivery?

  -

- If you had a magic wand and could make any changes to the way the VA communicates with you what would that be?

  - Send reminders that the VA is trying to reach him. Sometimes he doesn’t think he gets emails. Receives some voicemails.

- Do you have any additional feedback on the process or terms we discussed today?
