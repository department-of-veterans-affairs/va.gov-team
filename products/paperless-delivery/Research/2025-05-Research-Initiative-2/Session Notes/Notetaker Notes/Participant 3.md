**Test name:** Paperless Delivery\
**Device:** Desktop\
**Prototype order:** radio button then checkbox\

## **Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes**

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

1. First can you tell me if you have a VA.gov account?

   1. Nurse Practitioner at the VA and is very accustomed to technology so as soon as she knew [va.gov](http://va.gov) was available she signed up. Maybe in like 2008 or 2009.

2. When do you log into your VA.gov account? What prompts you?

   1. Check Appointments is the number one reason

   2. Reads notes

   3. Looks at lab results

   4. Looks at radiology results - LOVES doing this


## **First Task: Feelings toward Digital Communication - 5 minutes**

Interest in Digital Communications

- Are you interested in receiving all or some of your documents like the 1095-B tax document, decision letters, or other communications only digitally on VA.gov and not receiving paper copies by mail? Why or why not?

  - Yes. All of them. They don’t like duplication. Example: gets an appointment digitally and puts it on her phone. But then they also get a reminder in the mail - it’s a waste of money. She already knows she has an appointment. 

    - She throws the appointment reminders away when they come in the mail.

- Is there anything that would make you more likely to choose digital communication only and not receive paper mail?

  - Appointments don’t identify which clinic appointments are at and the phone number listed is just the generic phone number which isn’t helpful. The paper appointment reminders have the location which is helpful. Wants that info added digitally.

Hesitation to Digital Forms

- Can you tell me a little about how you typically receive important forms or communications? (e.g. through physical mail, email, etc.)

  - Usually electronically. She teaches nursing online and is VERY familiar with digital. She knows other people may not be good but thinks they need to start and maybe there can be resources available to help become more savvy.

- What made you feel confident or unsure about those experiences? (e.g. privacy, security, reliability, ease of access)

  - Confident. She uses similar authentication for her bank so [va.gov](http://va.gov) feels just as safe to use.

- Are there any VA documents or other communication you would prefer to receive by physical mail vs only digitally on your VA.gov account? Why?

  - No. Can’t think of any.

- Would you feel comfortable printing a copy yourself instead of having it mailed to you?

  - Yes. They do it all the time.

- Do you have any concerns about switching to digital communication?

  - No. Just wants to know what clinic her appointments are at.


### **Things to watch for:**

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would like to receive digitally

  - Appointment reminders

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would NOT like to receive digitally

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would like to continue receiving via paper.


## **Second Task: Existing Usability and Navigation Mental Models - 5 minutes**

- If you wanted to control how a company sends you emails or texts — where would you navigate to control that? What kinds of settings would you look for?

  - Start with “Settings” > look for “Communications” and try to decrease the amount of notifications she gets. Doesn’t like getting a lot of emails or texts.

- If you wanted to control how a company sends you physical mail — where would you navigate to control that? What kinds of settings would you look for?

  - She lives in two different places in the year. Attempted to try and stop mail while they were away and called each one and made a request. But that didn’t even work.

  - Start with “Settings” > “Notifications” 

- Go ahead and log in to your VA.gov account. Now, talk me though where you’d expect to go and what you would expect to see to stop receiving the 1095-B tax form by mail. Please share your thoughts out loud. As you are navigating, if there is a section you would expect to exist, share what you are looking for out loud.

  - Used the app, doesn’t really log onto va.gov very often.

  - She would love delegate access for accessing an account - be able to access her husband’s account.

  - Mobile app > Menu > Get Started, Forms, Find a Location, Contact Us

    - That’s a lot of top pages: wants them bolded because she has a hard time seeing.

  - Would try to be looking for something called “Settings”, “Notifications”, “Communication”

  - Missed clicking Profile on mobile app


## **Third Task: Usability and Navigation \[Prototype] - 10 minutes**

- We will now provide a prototype for you to interact with. This prototype has limited functionality so do not expect all buttons to work. As you navigate through the prototype please share any thoughts, frustrations, or points of confusion.

- Navigate to where you would expect to update your delivery preferences.

  - Sign In > Try Search first > Went to the top right and tried to click Contact Us > Wants to open all of the drop down

    - Wants to click the top right name to go to profile. 

    - Had to tell her how to click the Profile link

    - Didn’t know how to scroll with no scroll bar

    - Went to Communication Settings > wanted to click Notification settings

      - She would want to verify the email address things are getting sent to

      - How often she wants notifications

      - Which VAs she wants notifications about - VISIN 16 notifications. Should be able to select which location she wants notifications from.

    - Had to be prompted to click Paperless Delivery Settings

- Based on what you see here, what delivery settings are selected for this account?

  - Enroll in digital delivery - paperless

  - She doesn’t know what the 1095-B is

- What documents would these settings apply to?

  - Assumed it was paperless for everything

- How do you feel about being auto opted in to paperless delivery?

  - She would like to give consent to do it. 

  - Should be able to choose which things they want paperless. Maybe some people want a claim letter by mail for example but other things paperless.

- How would you define what ‘paperless settings’ are? (expected response: they will not receive mail but instead will access documents on [VA.gov](http://va.gov))

  - Getting all documents and reminders electronically

  - Paperless delivery vs Notifications?

    - Paperless delivery: something specific for her (reimbursement form) but Notifications: you can only access a hospital a certain way. She says there seems to be a slight difference between the two.

- Can you think of any other names that would make more sense to you than ‘paperless settings’?

  - She likes Digital Delivery. Likes it more than Paperless. Higher tech standing.

- Now, imagine you would like to change your delivery preferences, talk me through how you would expect to do that.

  - She said some people might want paper only so there should be a third option. She might not want “both”. She doesn’t like duplication so she wouldn’t select that one.

- Update the prototype to receive paper mail.

- After updating your preferences, how confident do you feel that your changes have been saved?

  - Confident. Likes the update checkmark. 

  - She said she doesn’t need another notification that her preferences are updated.

- When do you think your updated preferences will start taking effect?

  - Immediately.

- How easy or difficult was it to interact with the prototype on your device?

  - Very easy.

- I will now provide an alternative view (radio or checkbox) of the paperless delivery page for you to opt in to paperless delivery on.\

- Navigate to where you would expect to update your delivery preferences.

  - Still wanted to go to the top name again.

  - Communication settings > 

  - Change her email: manage email and text  notifications, sick of getting notifications

  - Sick and tired of going to the mailbox, would go to paperless

- Based on what you see here, what delivery settings are selected for this account?

  - No more paper mail. Period. Would assume it would be for all documents - didn’t connect it was just for 1095-B. 

  - Didn’t like the check mark went away when she unchecked it.

- Update the prototype to receive paper mail.

- How easy or difficult was it to interact with the prototype on your device?

  - Easy. She can see no difference between the two.

- Did you notice any features that made it easier or harder for you to complete the tasks?

  - No.

- Which option did you prefer?

  - She likes checkmarks over radio buttons. She uses them for online courses and her students don’t like radio buttons.

  - However, she didn’t assume that unchecking the box would give her paper.


## **Post-Task Interview - 3 minutes**

- After seeing this prototype, is there anything that might make you hesitate or decide not to sign up for paperless delivery?

  - No.

- If you had a magic wand and could make any changes to the way the VA communicates with you what would that be?

  - Appointment clinic location Information on the app. She said it used to be there but went away. 

- Do you have any additional feedback on the process or terms we discussed today?
