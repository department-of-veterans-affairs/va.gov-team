## **First Task: Feelings toward Digital Communication (5 minutes)**

### **Interest in Digital Communications**

- **Interest in receiving documents digitally:** "I would prefer everything to be digital"

- **Why:**

  - "They don't have to print out a lot"

  - "That doesn't make sense to me because I can go to VA.gov and get it that way"

  - "It's just a summary note, that's just a waste of paper"

  - Better access (mentions upcoming eye appointment next week)


### **What would make you more likely to choose digital communication**

- Environmental concerns: "Doesn't want to waste paper"

- Security concerns about mail theft


### **Current Communication Preferences**

- **How you receive important forms/communications:** "Normally I get letters in the mail and as an email"

- **Preference:** "I'd rather get stuff going to my account, since records and things are getting crazy in this country. Maybe someone steals my mail, worries me"


### **Confidence/Security with Digital**

- **Privacy/Security/Reliability concerns:**

  - Worried about mail theft: "Maybe someone steals my mail, worries me"

  - Concerned about narcotic deliveries: "Narcotic is delivered, which feels dangerous"

  - Prefers digital for security


### **Documents preferred via physical mail**

- "NOTHING NEEDS TO BE PHYSICAL, it can all be digital"


### **Comfort with printing copies yourself**

- "He would print if he needed something, no issue"


### **Concerns about switching to digital**

- "No concerns about switching to digital only"

- Also likes text notifications: "I also like texts, birthday is good to confirm it's for you. That's ok. Text & email are both good"


### **Documents to receive digitally**

- Everything


### **Documents NOT to receive digitally**

- None


### **Documents to continue receiving via paper**

- None


## **Second Task: Existing Usability and Navigation Mental Models (5 minutes)**

### **Where to control company emails/texts**

- "Hit the menu button with what you can do, thinks there might be restrictions"

- No clear idea off the top of his head


### **Where to control company physical mail**

- "Would expect to fill out a form from the VA hospital saying I want everything paperless or electronically"


### **Navigation to stop receiving 1095-B by mail**

- **Extremely difficult navigation - got completely lost:**

  - Started looking under VA department information, scrolled all the way down

  - Tried menu but got stuck in the department VA.gov menu

  - Looked under "programs and initiatives" - TOTALLY LOST

  - Searched for "Stop having paper to come to my address"

  - Tried "administrations and staff offices"

  - Looking specifically for the word "paperless"

  - Tried MyVA, scrolling through but "can't find anything"

  - Tried "contact us" - "That's not it"

  - "Not finding what he's looking for at all!"

  - **Finally guided to click his name** â†’ thinks could be under profile

  - Looked at "manage your personal information" but didn't scroll much

- **Ideal location:** "In your dream world, I'd probably keep it under MyVA. It would say 'go paperless'"


## **Third Task: Usability and Navigation \[Prototype] (10 minutes)**

### **Navigate to delivery preferences**

- Successfully signed in to prototype


### **Current delivery settings selected**

- Recognized current settings


### **Documents these settings apply to**

- "It doesn't have health summaries so I don't care"

- Limited scope noted


### **Feelings about auto opt-in to paperless**

- **Against auto opt-in:** "I would opt in to auto. VA can't automatically opt me in. I want someone to ask me first"

- "Don't want something that does stuff for them"


### **Definition of 'paperless settings'**

- Understands concept but finds label confusing


### **Other names that make sense**

- **Preferred:** "Go paperless"

- **Alternative:** "How would you like to change your notifications?"


### **How to change delivery preferences**

- Found "Update paperless delivery settings" but said "this is a bit tricky"


### **Update to receive paper mail**

- Successfully updated but expressed confusion


### **Confidence changes were saved**

- **90% confident** but added: "I'm not confident I will receive both. Hesitant - but said probably, since they're better at sending papers"


### **How will you receive 1095-B after update**

- Understood he would receive both paper and digital copies

- "Currently they are doing paper and digital copies"


### **When will preferences take effect**

- "I would give them at least 45-60 days, usually it's 10-14 days, but we'll give them time"


### **Ease of interaction with prototype**

- "It was easy to interact"


### **Alternative view comparison**

- **Radio button version:** Reviewed, seemed to understand

- **Checkbox version:** Initially said "doesn't have options, it doesn't have anything, so I'm not too sure"

- After guidance: "Checkbox version was harder" initially, then "Says he likes this one"


### **Features that made it easier/harder**

- **Checkbox confusion initially:** "Check box option doesn't have options. It doesn't have anything"

- **After explanation:** "Checkbox is more understandable. It's like opt in or opt out"


### **Which option preferred**

- **Final preference:** Checkbox - "Says checkbox is more clear" and "Checkbox is more understandable"

- **Reasoning:** "Time saver, don't have to wait for mail"

- **Note:** "But it doesn't say electronically, but paperless implies it"


## **Post-Task Interview (3 minutes)**

### **Hesitations about paperless delivery**

- None mentioned


### **Magic wand changes to VA communication**

- "Nothing to change"


### **Additional feedback**

- Strong preference for environmental benefits and efficiency

- Expressed frustration with current navigation difficulty
