# Participant #2 Notes

**Date:** 6/10/2025\
**Time:** 2:00pm - 2:45pm Eastern\
**Test name:** Paperless Delivery\
**Device:** Laptop\
**Prototype Order:** Checkbox/Radio\

## **Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes**

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

1. What device will you be using today?

   1. HP Desktop

2. What browser are you using?

   1. Chrome

3. First can you tell me if you have a VA.gov account?

   1. Yes

4. When do you log into your VA.gov account? What prompts you?

   1. Not very often. If he was interested in finding out more information he would login.

   2. Usually the ebenefits monthly or biweekly email prompts him to login


## **First Task: Feelings toward Digital Communication - 5 minutes**

Interest in Digital Communications

- Are you interested in receiving all or some of your documents like the 1095-B tax document, decision letters, or other communications only digitally on VA.gov and not receiving paper copies by mail? Why or why not?

  - He would rather something just get sent to him rather than trying to find something himself.

  - Digital is fine. Just as long as he can get an email that something is ready and he needs to look at it.

- Is there anything that would make you more likely to choose digital communication only and not receive paper mail?

  - No. He is fine with digital.

Hesitation to Digital Forms

- Can you tell me a little about how you typically receive important forms or communications? (e.g. through physical mail, email, etc.)

  - Most everything comes through email. 50% of his bank statements are both digital and physical. Easier to look at bank statements together with a physical copy.

- What made you feel confident or unsure about those experiences? (e.g. privacy, security, reliability, ease of access)

  - Haven’t had a bad experience with digital so nothing negative to say.

  - It’s just nice to have a paper record sometimes. The way he organizes documents it’s super easy for him to file away physical forms and find what he’s looking for right away.

- Are there any VA documents or other communication you would prefer to receive by physical mail vs only digitally on your VA.gov account? Why?

  - No. The annual disability letter is nice to get physically but not a requirement.

- Would you feel comfortable printing a copy yourself instead of having it mailed to you?

  - He feels printing digitally feels more current than receiving a physical mail.

  - Example: downloaded a VA letter to get a hunting license and it shows the current date when it’s downloaded - feels the most up to date.

- Do you have any concerns about switching to digital communication?

  - No. Just really wants to make sure he gets notified about things so he doesn’t  have to go looking.


### **Things to watch for:**

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would like to receive digitally

  -

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would NOT like to receive digitally

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would like to continue receiving via paper.


## **Second Task: Existing Usability and Navigation Mental Models - 5 minutes**

- If you wanted to control how a company sends you emails or texts — where would you navigate to control that? What kinds of settings would you look for?

  - Profile > drop down menu > how would you like to interact with the company > paper, digitally, or both

- If you wanted to control how a company sends you physical mail — where would you navigate to control that? What kinds of settings would you look for?

  - Same place as above with the ability to validate mailing address

- Go ahead and log in to your VA.gov account. Now, talk me though where you’d expect to go and what you would expect to see to stop receiving the 1095-B tax form by mail. Please share your thoughts out loud. As you are navigating, if there is a section you would expect to exist, share what you are looking for out loud.

  - Looked around on the home page first

  - Looking for something like”Update Settings”

  - Clicked top right name > Profile

  - Notification Settings

  - Seems that he would get everything by mail unless he signed up for Notifications


## **Third Task: Usability and Navigation \[Prototype] - 10 minutes**

- We will now provide a prototype for you to interact with. This prototype has limited functionality so do not expect all buttons to work. As you navigate through the prototype please share any thoughts, frustrations, or points of confusion.

- Navigate to where you would expect to update your delivery preferences.

  - Sign In

  - Scrolled the My VA page

  - Navigated to Profile

  - Called out Communication Settings right away

  - Wasn’t sure which link to click on Notifications or Paperless. Wanted to click on both to make it was what he wanted to do

    - Would think there would be one place/page to go to. They are all Communications

  - Paperless: physical mail

  - Notifications: only text and email

- Based on what you see here, what delivery settings are selected for this account?

  - He said there was a lot more than he thought. He didn’t realize it could be so subdivided. He thought it would be a general paperless setting for everything, not for each type of document. Feels like it makes it more complicated to have this many options. 

  - Thinks there should be a way to select all rather than having to go one by one.

  - Everything is going to be sent by mail. No checkmarks.

- What documents would these settings apply to?

  - Accurately described which documents were available for paperless

- How do you feel about being auto opted in to paperless delivery?

  - He doesn’t necessarily like that. His banking accounts did that and he didn’t like that. He doesn’t like things being done for him.

- How would you define what ‘paperless settings’ are? (expected response: they will not receive mail but instead will access documents on [VA.gov](http://va.gov))

  - Whether or not you wanted to no longer receive mail from the VA.

  - Notifications Settings: whether or not he wants to receive text and emails from the VA

- Can you think of any other names that would make more sense to you than ‘paperless settings’?

  - No, it accurately describes things.

- Now, imagine you would like to change your delivery preferences, talk me through how you would expect to do that.

  - Clicked on the checkbox

- Update the prototype to receive paper mail.

- After updating your preferences, how confident do you feel that your changes have been saved?

  - Pretty confident. Didn’t see the saved alert

  - He would prefer an email notification that his settings have been changed.

- Optional - If participant expected a confirmation: Can you describe what steps you would take if you did not receive a confirmation?

  -

- Now that you updated your preferences, how will you receive your 1095-B?

  - He thinks he’ll get an email when the form is available

- When do you think your updated preferences will start taking effect?

  - Almost immediately

- How easy or difficult was it to interact with the prototype on your device?

  - Fairly easy

- I will now provide an alternative view (radio or checkbox) of the paperless delivery page for you to opt in to paperless delivery on.\

- Navigate to where you would expect to update your delivery preferences.

- Based on what you see here, what delivery settings are selected for this account?

  - Everything sent via physical mail

- Update the prototype to receive paper mail.

  - Noticed the Update Saved alert this time

  - Still wants an email notification that his settings were updated.

- How easy or difficult was it to interact with the prototype on your device?

  - Pretty easy

- Did you notice any features that made it easier or harder for you to complete the tasks?

  - It’s a lot more direct than the checkbox version. Checkbox had a lot more language

- Which option did you prefer?

  - Checkboxes

  - But said he likes the radio - it’s more specific 

  - Still wants a select all option

- Option 3 with instructions in each section

  - He likes this one the most - instructions are clear. Focuses him more. More straightforward.


## **Post-Task Interview - 3 minutes**

- After seeing this prototype, is there anything that might make you hesitate or decide not to sign up for paperless delivery?

  - It would all depend on easy it would be to get the documents.

    - Example: really hard form him to get access to tennis tickets he purchased

  - Most concerned with how easy it is to digitally access these documents

- If you had a magic wand and could make any changes to the way the VA communicates with you what would that be?

  - Wouldn’t have to sign in every time. If he clicks something in his email, signing in is a headache.

- Do you have any additional feedback on the process or terms we discussed today?

  - No, would keep the paperless delivery naming. Very accurate
