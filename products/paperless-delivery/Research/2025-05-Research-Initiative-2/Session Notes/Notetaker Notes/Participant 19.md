**Test name:** Paperless Delivery\
**Device:** Laptop\
**Prototype Order:** Radio/Checkbox\

## **Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes**

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

1. What device will you be using today?

   1. HP Desktop

2. What browser are you using?

   1. Chrome but sometimes Edge or Firefox

3. First can you tell me if you have a VA.gov account?

   1. Yes

4. When do you log into your VA.gov account? What prompts you?

   1. Mostly to check for appointments or refill prescriptions

   2. Checking monthly

   3. Also to check if there are any new vaccines that are coming up 

   4. She checks things proactively, didn’t say anything prompts her.


## **First Task: Feelings toward Digital Communication - 5 minutes**

Interest in Digital Communications

- Are you interested in receiving all or some of your documents like the 1095-B tax document, decision letters, or other communications only digitally on VA.gov and not receiving paper copies by mail? Why or why not?

  - That would be perfect

  - She has a PO Box and sometimes things can get lost there - she’s had doctors letters get lost or really late.

- Is there anything that would make you more likely to choose digital communication only and not receive paper mail?

  - Privacy concerns with physical mail - people were breaking into mailboxes in her neighborhood. PO Box is more secure. 

Hesitation to Digital Forms

- Can you tell me a little about how you typically receive important forms or communications? (e.g. through physical mail, email, etc.)

  - She has tried to setup paperless for most things - Vista bill.

  - Gets email notifications when things are due and can just log on and pay. Much more convenient than physical.

- What made you feel confident or unsure about those experiences? (e.g. privacy, security, reliability, ease of access)

  - She has Norton’s so she feels confident with that security.

  - Feels confident doing things digitally.

- Are there any VA documents or other communication you would prefer to receive by physical mail vs only digitally on your VA.gov account? Why?

  - No, not really

- Would you feel comfortable printing a copy yourself instead of having it mailed to you?

  - Yes. She does that all the time. If she has an appointment she will often print things out and bring them to doctors.

  - She prefers printing things out herself if she needs them. Shreds them afterwards if she needs to.

- Do you have any concerns about switching to digital communication?

  - No.


### **Things to watch for:**

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would like to receive digitally

  -

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would NOT like to receive digitally

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would like to continue receiving via paper.


## **Second Task: Existing Usability and Navigation Mental Models - 5 minutes**

- If you wanted to control how a company sends you emails or texts — where would you navigate to control that? What kinds of settings would you look for?

  - Settings > Paperless

- If you wanted to control how a company sends you physical mail — where would you navigate to control that? What kinds of settings would you look for?

  - Same place > Settings

- Go ahead and log in to your VA.gov account. Now, talk me though where you’d expect to go and what you would expect to see to stop receiving the 1095-B tax form by mail. Please share your thoughts out loud. As you are navigating, if there is a section you would expect to exist, share what you are looking for out loud.

  - She went to her VA Health Portal first. 

  - Top right name drop down > Profile

  - Notifications Settings


## **Third Task: Usability and Navigation \[Prototype] - 10 minutes**

- We will now provide a prototype for you to interact with. This prototype has limited functionality so do not expect all buttons to work. As you navigate through the prototype please share any thoughts, frustrations, or points of confusion.

- Navigate to where you would expect to update your delivery preferences.

  - Wanted to use the Search

  - Sign In > Profile

  - Might search paperless

  - Saw Communication Settings - that makes sense

  - Saw paperless

  - Wouldn’t go looking for paperless settings and has hardly gone into her email and text notifications page 

- Based on what you see here, what delivery settings are selected for this account?

  - Everything is set to paper mail

- What documents would these settings apply to?

  - Accurately read the documents 

- How do you feel about being auto opted in to paperless delivery?

  - Hesitant. She would want to do it herself.

- How would you define what ‘paperless settings’ are? (expected response: they will not receive mail but instead will access documents on [VA.gov](http://va.gov))

  -

- Can you think of any other names that would make more sense to you than ‘paperless settings’?

  - No.

- Now, imagine you would like to change your delivery preferences, talk me through how you would expect to do that.

  - She isn’t sure what some of these documents are. She doesn’t know what documents she needs. She would only really use the Benefits section stuff.

- Update the prototype to receive paper mail.

  - Took her a minute to find the right document

  - Clicked opt-in to paperless. Noticed Update saved. 

- After updating your preferences, how confident do you feel that your changes have been saved?

  - Confident. 

- Optional - If participant expected a confirmation: Can you describe what steps you would take if you did not receive a confirmation?

  - She might go to another screen and come back just to make sure it saved.

  - She said she wouldn’t mind an email that her preferences were updated but doesn’t need it.

- Now that you updated your preferences, how will you receive your 1095-B?

  - Assumed email 

- When do you think your updated preferences will start taking effect?

  - 24 - 72 hrs

- How easy or difficult was it to interact with the prototype on your device?

  - Fairly easy

- I will now provide an alternative view (radio or checkbox) of the paperless delivery page for you to opt in to paperless delivery on.\

- Navigate to where you would expect to update your delivery preferences.

  - Tried to click Profile under the name drop down

- Based on what you see here, what delivery settings are selected for this account?

  - No delivery settings. Didn’t know how the user would get their documents. She said that the checkboxes doesn’t have the option to get something mailed to you.

  - She didn’t think you could click things on this page

  - Ended up clicking a box - now understands she won’t get a paper mail if its checked

  - Took awhile but said that if she doesn’t click on it she should expect a paper in the mail

- Update the prototype to receive paper mail.

- How easy or difficult was it to interact with the prototype on your device?

  - Not hard at all

- Did you notice any features that made it easier or harder for you to complete the tasks?

  - No. Self explanatory

- Which option did you prefer?

  - She prefers this one

- Third option

  - She likes this one the most. Likes the instructions

  - Assume unchecked boxes are sent in the mail


## **Post-Task Interview - 3 minutes**

- After seeing this prototype, is there anything that might make you hesitate or decide not to sign up for paperless delivery?

  - No, not at all

- If you had a magic wand and could make any changes to the way the VA communicates with you what would that be?

  - Can’t think of anything. Very happy with the VA in Spokane.

- Do you have any additional feedback on the process or terms we discussed today?
