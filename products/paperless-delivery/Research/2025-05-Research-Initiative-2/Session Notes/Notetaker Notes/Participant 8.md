# Participant #8 Notes

**Date:** 6/3/2025\
**Time:** 2:00 - 2:45 Eastern\
**Test name:** Paperless Delivery\
**Device:** Desktop\
**Prototype order:** Checkbox/Radio


## **Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes**

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

1. First can you tell me if you have a VA.gov account?

   1. Disabled Veteran so logging in a lot for disability/healthcare reasons

2. When do you log into your VA.gov account? What prompts you?

   1. Logging in a couple times a week - medical appointments, mental health + primary care


## **First Task: Feelings toward Digital Communication - 5 minutes**

Interest in Digital Communications

- Are you interested in receiving all or some of your documents like the 1095-B tax document, decision letters, or other communications only digitally on VA.gov and not receiving paper copies by mail? Why or why not?

  - Yes. Getting emails, texts, and papers right now.

- Is there anything that would make you more likely to choose digital communication only and not receive paper mail?

  - Digital. More convenient.

Hesitation to Digital Forms

- Can you tell me a little about how you typically receive important forms or communications? (e.g. through physical mail, email, etc.)

  - Bills, mortgage statements, credit card, all digital

  - Utility bill = can’t figure out how to get it digitally.

  - Prefer it because he pays for all his bills online.

- What made you feel confident or unsure about those experiences? (e.g. privacy, security, reliability, ease of access)

  - Practice. He’s done things digitally for so long so that’s built his confidence over time. Hesitant when first started. It’s become the norm now.

- Are there any VA documents or other communication you would prefer to receive by physical mail vs only digitally on your VA.gov account? Why?

  - No. 

  - Claims decisions are  nice but you get the decision digitally before you get it in the mail anyways.

- Would you feel comfortable printing a copy yourself instead of having it mailed to you?

  - Yes

- Do you have any concerns about switching to digital communication?

  - No.


### **Things to watch for:**

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would like to receive digitally

  -

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would NOT like to receive digitally

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would like to continue receiving via paper.


## **Second Task: Existing Usability and Navigation Mental Models - 5 minutes**

- If you wanted to control how a company sends you emails or texts — where would you navigate to control that? What kinds of settings would you look for?

  - In his Profile > Communication Preferences > Email or Text or Both. Maybe a “Go Paperless” note somewhere

- If you wanted to control how a company sends you physical mail — where would you navigate to control that? What kinds of settings would you look for?

  - Probably in the section he is setting up his address. Might be grouped in with Communication Preferences but a subsection with paper or go paperless. Should all be in the same neighborhood.

- Go ahead and log in to your VA.gov account. Now, talk me though where you’d expect to go and what you would expect to see to stop receiving the 1095-B tax form by mail. Please share your thoughts out loud. As you are navigating, if there is a section you would expect to exist, share what you are looking for out loud.

  - Top right name > Profile

  - Went down the left column first and went to Notification settings. Would assume to see the 1095-B within the Health care section in the Notification settings page. A “go paperless” link potentially.


## **Third Task: Usability and Navigation \[Prototype] - 10 minutes**

- We will now provide a prototype for you to interact with. This prototype has limited functionality so do not expect all buttons to work. As you navigate through the prototype please share any thoughts, frustrations, or points of confusion.

- Navigate to where you would expect to update your delivery preferences.

  - Tried to click top right to go  to Profile

  - Quickly scrolled. Noticed Communication settings

  - Likes that they are broken out - notifications vs paperless

  - Use to the name Notification so it took a minute to see the Communication settings.

  - Tried to click on email and text because if was first in line - assumed they could do it right on the notifications page. Maybe having it on one screen would be a bit easier. Depends on how much is on each page though.

- Based on what you see here, what delivery settings are selected for this account?

  - No difference between notification settings and paperless settings.

  - Enrolled in paperless

- What documents would these settings apply to?

  - Confused if it is just for the 1095-B or if it is for everything. 

- How do you feel about being auto opted in to paperless delivery?

  - Would be fine with it if they can customize later.

  - Wants the text, email, and paper option all in one place. With maybe the ability to choose all: getting both digital and paper delivery.

  - Might be less confusing if it was on one screen with the Notification settings.

- How would you define what ‘paperless settings’ are? (expected response: they will not receive mail but instead will access documents on [VA.gov](http://va.gov))

  - Not paper - text or email

- Can you think of any other names that would make more sense to you than ‘paperless settings’?

  - No, it feels universal.

- Now, imagine you would like to change your delivery preferences, talk me through how you would expect to do that.

  - Seemed a little confused by the checkbox behavior. 

  - Have the default NOT enrolled.

- Update the prototype to receive paper mail.

- After updating your preferences, how confident do you feel that your changes have been saved?

  - Confident. Doesn’t feel like they want a saved button.

- Optional - If participant expected a confirmation: Can you describe what steps you would take if you did not receive a confirmation?

  - Nothing, he’s too trusting. 

- Now that you updated your preferences, how will you receive your 1095-B?

  - Email. But wants the text option too.

- When do you think your updated preferences will start taking effect?

  - The next cycle - maybe add context for users when it will take effect.

- How easy or difficult was it to interact with the prototype on your device?

  - Pretty easy.

- I will now provide an alternative view (radio or checkbox) of the paperless delivery page for you to opt in to paperless delivery on.\

- Navigate to where you would expect to update your delivery preferences.

  - Went right to Communication Settings

- Based on what you see here, what delivery settings are selected for this account?

  - He likes how clear the radio buttons are. Choices are more clear.

  - Other option doesn’t explicitly say what happens when the box isn’t checked

- Update the prototype to receive paper mail.

- How easy or difficult was it to interact with the prototype on your device?

  - Easy.

- Did you notice any features that made it easier or harder for you to complete the tasks?

  -

- Which option did you prefer?

  - Radio Buttons


## **Post-Task Interview - 3 minutes**

- After seeing this prototype, is there anything that might make you hesitate or decide not to sign up for paperless delivery?

  - No, I like it.

- If you had a magic wand and could make any changes to the way the VA communicates with you what would that be?

  - Right now the va does a really good job communicating with him -  he’s already received the email reminder and text reminder and mail correspondence. 

- Do you have any additional feedback on the process or terms we discussed today?

  - Really likes the interface with the radio buttons + communication settings

  - Receives the most correspondence for medical appointments
