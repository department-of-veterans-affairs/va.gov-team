## **Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes**

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

1. First can you tell me if you have a VA.gov account?

   1. Using Safari on an iphone

2. When do you log into your VA.gov account? What prompts you?

   1. A couple years. Pretty often.  Uses secure messaging to contact practitioners. Renews prescriptions there. Those are the two most common ways they use [va.gov](http://va.gov). Gets email or text reminders which prompts them to login and find out more information.

   2. They have two homes so they are dependent on good tracking of prescriptions so they aren’t sent when he’s not there.


## **First Task: Feelings toward Digital Communication - 5 minutes**

Interest in Digital Communications

- Are you interested in receiving all or some of your documents like the 1095-B tax document, decision letters, or other communications only digitally on VA.gov and not receiving paper copies by mail? Why or why not?

  - Yes, they prefer digital. Physical is wasteful - waste of paper. They said that different locations/facilities are more redundant than others. If he wants a physical copy, he would just print it.

- Is there anything that would make you more likely to choose digital communication only and not receive paper mail?

  - Give people the option to opt into paperless or not. Maybe do this when you first visit a facility. However there are A LOT of older Veterans who would not ever want things digitally.

  - He received a big box of mail and half of it was from the VA. Most got thrown away because they were just appointment reminders. He also gets them the day or the day after of the appointment - completely unhelpful.

  - Texts and email reminders are very helpful though. Likes those a lot.

Hesitation to Digital Forms

- Can you tell me a little about how you typically receive important forms or communications? (e.g. through physical mail, email, etc.)

  - Right now he’s in the process of getting a mortgage and all of it is digital. Prefers that.

  - Can’t remember the last time he wrote a letter.

- What made you feel confident or unsure about those experiences? (e.g. privacy, security, reliability, ease of access)

  - Used to have concerns with privacy and security but that has lessened over the years. Has bought houses with little communication with humans and felt more confident after those experiences. Need to at least feel trust with the people/businesses you’re dealing with.

  - Switched over to [id.me](http://id.me) from myhealthevet. Feels good to go on that.

- Are there any VA documents or other communication you would prefer to receive by physical mail vs only digitally on your VA.gov account? Why?

  - W2 forms. It was a little tricky to find and figure out how to download digitally.

  - Can’t remember the last time he wrote a check.

- Would you feel comfortable printing a copy yourself instead of having it mailed to you?

  - Yes. Sometimes prints out copies of digital documents for important things - final mortgage documents

- Do you have any concerns about switching to digital communication?

  - No. Already doing it as much as he can.


### **Things to watch for:**

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would like to receive digitally

  - Appointment reminders (removing duplicity)

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would NOT like to receive digitally

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would like to continue receiving via paper.

  - W-2


## **Second Task: Existing Usability and Navigation Mental Models - 5 minutes**

- If you wanted to control how a company sends you emails or texts — where would you navigate to control that? What kinds of settings would you look for?

  - Was a little confused by the question. Would not know off the top of this head where something like that would live. Mentioned Profile to update address.

  - He isn’t actively searching out for those settings but if he is prompted then he might update his selections.

- If you wanted to control how a company sends you physical mail — where would you navigate to control that? What kinds of settings would you look for?

  - Same as above

- Go ahead and log in to your VA.gov account. Now, talk me though where you’d expect to go and what you would expect to see to stop receiving the 1095-B tax form by mail. Please share your thoughts out loud. As you are navigating, if there is a section you would expect to exist, share what you are looking for out loud.

  - Scrolled through the My VA page first and didn’t find anything. Was looking for a “Change…” direction

  - Might be under Profile. Went to Personal Information first - looking to change his address. Went to Contact Information next but he noticed it didn’t call out where to send stuff. So that wasn’t helpful. Would assume changing the mailing address in Contact Information would change where mail gets sent.

  - Not finding anything there.


## **Third Task: Usability and Navigation \[Prototype] - 10 minutes**

- We will now provide a prototype for you to interact with. This prototype has limited functionality so do not expect all buttons to work. As you navigate through the prototype please share any thoughts, frustrations, or points of confusion.

- Navigate to where you would expect to update your delivery preferences.

  - Signed In. Scrolled down My VA page first. Tried to click Menu in the top right. 

- Based on what you see here, what delivery settings are selected for this account?

- What documents would these settings apply to?

  - Only email. 

  - Prompted again and said 1095-B Proof of Healthcare ONLY.

- How do you feel about being auto opted in to paperless delivery?

  - He wouldn’t mind.

- How would you define what ‘paperless settings’ are? (expected response: they will not receive mail but instead will access documents on [VA.gov](http://va.gov))

  - Enrolled in digital delivery.

  - When you receive everything digitally instead of paper

- Can you think of any other names that would make more sense to you than ‘paperless settings’?

  - No paper

- Now, imagine you would like to change your delivery preferences, talk me through how you would expect to do that.

  - I would update email. And if I wanted paper I’d select send me paper.

- Update the prototype to receive paper mail.

- After updating your preferences, how confident do you feel that your changes have been saved?

  - Has faith but would be sure once he doesn’t see it in the mail.

- Optional - If participant expected a confirmation: Can you describe what steps you would take if you did not receive a confirmation?

  -

- Now that you updated your preferences, how will you receive your 1095-B?

  - Digitally.

- When do you think your updated preferences will start taking effect?

  -

- How easy or difficult was it to interact with the prototype on your device?

  - Easy once he was talked through.

  - Easier: email with good instructions on what/how to do it.

  - “To change this… do this…” more bold and more concise messaging. 

- I will now provide an alternative view (radio or checkbox) of the paperless delivery page for you to opt in to paperless delivery on.\

- Navigate to where you would expect to update your delivery preferences.

- Based on what you see here, what delivery settings are selected for this account?

  - Continues to try and look at My VA and Menu before going to Profile.

  - Expecting to see something in the menu - “change…” “go to paperless”

  - Tried using the Profile menu

  - Went to the paperless page.

    - If I don’t want to be enrolled, I would assume I would just uncheck.

  - Less confusion with checkmark than radio buttons. It was so subtle that it wasn’t very significant.

- Update the prototype to receive paper mail.

- How easy or difficult was it to interact with the prototype on your device?

  - Simpler. Less ambiguous than the radio buttons

- Did you notice any features that made it easier or harder for you to complete the tasks?

  - Checkbox. And “no more paper mail” language.

- Which option did you prefer?

  - checkbox


## **Post-Task Interview - 3 minutes**

- After seeing this prototype, is there anything that might make you hesitate or decide not to sign up for paperless delivery?

  -

- If you had a magic wand and could make any changes to the way the VA communicates with you what would that be?

  -

- Do you have any additional feedback on the process or terms we discussed today?
