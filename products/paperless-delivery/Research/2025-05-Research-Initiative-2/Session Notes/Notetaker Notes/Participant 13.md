**Date:** 6/6/2025\
**Time:** 3:00pm -3:45pm Eastern\
**Test name:** Paperless Delivery\
**Device:** Laptop\
**Prototype Order:** Checkbox/Radio\

## **Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes**

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

1. What device will you be using today?

   1. Windows laptop + monitor

2. What browser are you using?

   1. Chrome

3. First can you tell me if you have a VA.gov account?

   1. Yes

4. When do you log into your VA.gov account? What prompts you?

   1. A lot of times its to check medications, upcoming appointments, change passwords. Mostly for appointments and medications.

   2. If she knows she needs to get medication renewed. An email about something then she logs in to look at it.


## **First Task: Feelings toward Digital Communication - 5 minutes**

Interest in Digital Communications

- Are you interested in receiving all or some of your documents like the 1095-B tax document, decision letters, or other communications only digitally on VA.gov and not receiving paper copies by mail? Why or why not?

  - Yes. She thinks she’s already set that up.

  - She has a printer a home if she needs a physical copy of something.

  - One less thing to get lost that has her personal information on it.

- Is there anything that would make you more likely to choose digital communication only and not receive paper mail?

  - Less waste. Safety and security.

Hesitation to Digital Forms

- Can you tell me a little about how you typically receive important forms or communications? (e.g. through physical mail, email, etc.)

  - She usually gets notifications that prompts her to look online. Most things she has are all digital.

  - She has one insurance bill that gets sent to her physically. 

  - Usually if there is a digital option she signs up for that.

- What made you feel confident or unsure about those experiences? (e.g. privacy, security, reliability, ease of access)

  - If it’s through the VA or a gov site she’s familiar with she’s inherently confident about it. Sounded like she’s more trusting of those places.

    - She trusts them because she’s familiar with them. Used their services and haven’t had an issue. Knows it’s legit.

- Are there any VA documents or other communication you would prefer to receive by physical mail vs only digitally on your VA.gov account? Why?

  - “I can’t think of anything”

  - When she goes to Education and needed a copy of her diploma. That feels like something that should be physical. Anything else she would be comfortable having things digital.

- Would you feel comfortable printing a copy yourself instead of having it mailed to you?

  - Yes.

- Do you have any concerns about switching to digital communication?

  - No. There’s always the uncertainty of safety with digital tools - hacks, security breaches, etc. But that’s just a normal worry for her that just part of the digital world.

  - There’s nothing she feels she can do if those things do happen but she just makes sure she updates her passwords.


### **Things to watch for:**

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would like to receive digitally

  -

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would NOT like to receive digitally

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would like to continue receiving via paper.


## **Second Task: Existing Usability and Navigation Mental Models - 5 minutes**

- If you wanted to control how a company sends you emails or texts — where would you navigate to control that? What kinds of settings would you look for?

  - “My Accounts” or “My Profile” > Settings, Communication Settings, Notifications. Usually a toggle switch or yes/no button for paper or different things. Some places prompt to ask you about paper when you first sign up.

- If you wanted to control how a company sends you physical mail — where would you navigate to control that? What kinds of settings would you look for?

  - Same place as above. Emails, texts, or physical mail. Usually options for all three.

- Go ahead and log in to your VA.gov account. Now, talk me though where you’d expect to go and what you would expect to see to stop receiving the 1095-B tax form by mail. Please share your thoughts out loud. As you are navigating, if there is a section you would expect to exist, share what you are looking for out loud.

  - She was confused why she was getting appointment reminders in the mail because she thought she opted out of those. Thought paperless already existed.

  - Logged In > top right Name > Profile 

  - Notification Settings - but it only said text and email so was a little hesitant

  - “This page is cumbersome”. There should be options for each - “digital all”. Maybe like a check all option for everything. 

  - Maybe have a physical mail option under each notification section with address to validate that’s where they want it sent.


## **Third Task: Usability and Navigation \[Prototype] - 10 minutes**

- We will now provide a prototype for you to interact with. This prototype has limited functionality so do not expect all buttons to work. As you navigate through the prototype please share any thoughts, frustrations, or points of confusion.

- Navigate to where you would expect to update your delivery preferences.

  - Sign In

  - Scrolled the My VA page to see if there was anything on the page

  - Went to Profile

  - Saw Communication Settings

    - “Perfect” that’s what she was looking for. Made sense the wording would change by adding the Mail in

    - Why are there two different links? Why wouldn’t one link be able to have everything?

  - How does she define notifications vs paperless?

    - There are differences but still thinks they are related. Didn’t give a clear answer to this. Needed to reask

    - Paperless delivery = how do you want to get information if you’re not getting it in the mail: text, email

    - Notification settings = a notification makes sound (like on her phone). But for email it’s how you want digital communications sent to you. 

  - Clicked Update Paperless Delivery Settings

    - She would uncheck the box if she wanted paper mail

- Based on what you see here, what delivery settings are selected for this account?

- What documents would these settings apply to?

  - Just the 1095-B

- How do you feel about being auto opted in to paperless delivery?

  - She is fine with that but would like to be notified about it. “Thanks for signing up, we have auto enrolled you. If you want mail, plz go here…”

- How would you define what ‘paperless settings’ are? (expected response: they will not receive mail but instead will access documents on [VA.gov](http://va.gov))

  -

- Can you think of any other names that would make more sense to you than ‘paperless settings’?

  - Physical Mail. Paperless Delivery is fine. Update Mail settings.

- Now, imagine you would like to change your delivery preferences, talk me through how you would expect to do that.

  -

- Update the prototype to receive paper mail.

- After updating your preferences, how confident do you feel that your changes have been saved?

  - She thinks something popped up. Couldn’t exactly remember. 

  - Thinks the Update Saved message could stay there longer.

  - 100% confident seeing the Update Saved message.

- Optional - If participant expected a confirmation: Can you describe what steps you would take if you did not receive a confirmation?

  - She doesn’t feel like she would need a confirmation.

  - She read “we’ll send a message” and assumed she’d get a message about the change. She changed her mind and said it might be nice to get an email saying that her settings were updated. But for her personally, she is fine without that notification.

  - But if there are several paperless items she might want a save button. And then one email that she’s updated settings.

- Now that you updated your preferences, how will you receive your 1095-B?

  - Emailed to her

- When do you think your updated preferences will start taking effect?

  - Immediately

- How easy or difficult was it to interact with the prototype on your device?

  - Very easy.

- I will now provide an alternative view (radio or checkbox) of the paperless delivery page for you to opt in to paperless delivery on.\

- Navigate to where you would expect to update your delivery preferences.

- Based on what you see here, what delivery settings are selected for this account?

  - Sign In > Checked My VA page first > Profile > Communication Settings

  - Clicked paperless delivery settings

  - Noticed the difference with radio button

- Update the prototype to receive paper mail.

  - Again, wants the Update Saved message to stay there longer.

- How easy or difficult was it to interact with the prototype on your device?

  - Very easy

- Did you notice any features that made it easier or harder for you to complete the tasks?

  - She thinks the two radio options here are more clear - it dumbs it down. With the checkbox she had to assume unchecking would send her paper.

- Which option did you prefer?

  - Radio buttons. Extremely simple.


## **Post-Task Interview - 3 minutes**

- After seeing this prototype, is there anything that might make you hesitate or decide not to sign up for paperless delivery?

  - No

- If you had a magic wand and could make any changes to the way the VA communicates with you what would that be?

  - Wish there was a paperless delivery option already. Save money

- Do you have any additional feedback on the process or terms we discussed today?

  - If there are several documents, there should be a way to choose paperless for all. Don’t want to have to go through each one individually
