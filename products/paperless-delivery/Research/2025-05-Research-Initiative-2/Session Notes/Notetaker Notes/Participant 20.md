## **Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes**

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

1. What device will you be using today?

   1. Samsung Galaxy mobile phone

2. What browser are you using?

   1. Chrome

3. First can you tell me if you have a VA.gov account?

   1. Yes, they have one

4. When do you log into your VA.gov account? What prompts you?

   1. No particular set rhythm. 

   2. Secure messaging or prescription refills 

   3. Prompted by email or text


## **First Task: Feelings toward Digital Communication - 5 minutes**

Interest in Digital Communications

- Are you interested in receiving all or some of your documents like the 1095-B tax document, decision letters, or other communications only digitally on VA.gov and not receiving paper copies by mail? Why or why not?

  - She still likes hard copies. But maybe she could have the option to choose digital if she wanted to.

- Is there anything that would make you more likely to choose digital communication only and not receive paper mail?

  - No, not really

Hesitation to Digital Forms

- Can you tell me a little about how you typically receive important forms or communications? (e.g. through physical mail, email, etc.)

  - By mail or email

  - Bills and statements

  - Just digitally = car information

    - She thinks she chose to receive those digitally

  - She chooses digitally if it’s a repetitive/predictable thing each month

  - Looking at something physically helps her remember to do things

- What made you feel confident or unsure about those experiences? (e.g. privacy, security, reliability, ease of access)

  - Feels confident because it’s been set up that way for so long

  - She has had no issues with privacy or security for either physical or digital.

  - She feels like digital might be slightly more reliable

  - Digital is easier to access as long as you remember all of your log ins and passwords

    - This is a barrier to continue enrolling in digital communications for more things

- Are there any VA documents or other communication you would prefer to receive by physical mail vs only digitally on your VA.gov account? Why?

  - Still wants to receive consult documents, appointment documents, community care bill documents by mail

- Would you feel comfortable printing a copy yourself instead of having it mailed to you?

  - Yes

- Do you have any concerns about switching to digital communication?

  - No


### **Things to watch for:**

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would like to receive digitally

  -

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would NOT like to receive digitally

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would like to continue receiving via paper.


## **Second Task: Existing Usability and Navigation Mental Models - 5 minutes**

- If you wanted to control how a company sends you emails or texts — where would you navigate to control that? What kinds of settings would you look for?

  - Alert Settings > wherever the Menu is

- If you wanted to control how a company sends you physical mail — where would you navigate to control that? What kinds of settings would you look for?

  - Same place > Alerts or Documentation

- Go ahead and log in to your VA.gov account. Now, talk me though where you’d expect to go and what you would expect to see to stop receiving the 1095-B tax form by mail. Please share your thoughts out loud. As you are navigating, if there is a section you would expect to exist, share what you are looking for out loud.

  - Menu > My VA > Go to Profile link

  - Contact Info or Personal Info > didn’t scroll

  - Prompted to scroll > Manage notification settings

  - Expects to see “stop receiving paper mail notifications”


## **Third Task: Usability and Navigation \[Prototype] - 10 minutes**

- We will now provide a prototype for you to interact with. This prototype has limited functionality so do not expect all buttons to work. As you navigate through the prototype please share any thoughts, frustrations, or points of confusion.

- Navigate to where you would expect to update your delivery preferences.

  - Sign in > scrolled the My VA page

  - Clicked Go to Profile

  - Communication Settings > Update Paperless Settings

- Based on what you see here, what delivery settings are selected for this account?

  - She thinks “email”

  - She was confused by the prompt she was given

  - Took her a minute to get oriented. Wasn’t able to correctly answer this question.

- What documents would these settings apply to?

  -

- How do you feel about being auto opted in to paperless delivery?

  - It’s okay

- How would you define what ‘paperless settings’ are? (expected response: they will not receive mail but instead will access documents on [VA.gov](http://va.gov))

  - You don’t receive it in the mail

- How would you define what notification settings are?

  - Paper, email, text, paperless.

  - She sees no difference between a notification setting and a paperless setting.

- Can you think of any other names that would make more sense to you than ‘paperless settings’?

  -

- Now, imagine you would like to change your delivery preferences, talk me through how you would expect to do that.

  - She checked the correct box

- Update the prototype to receive paper mail.

- After updating your preferences, how confident do you feel that your changes have been saved?

  - Confident. She saw the Update Saved alert. Doesn’t need anything else

- Optional - If participant expected a confirmation: Can you describe what steps you would take if you did not receive a confirmation?

  -

- Now that you updated your preferences, how will you receive your 1095-B?

  - Paperless

- When do you think your updated preferences will start taking effect?

  -

- How easy or difficult was it to interact with the prototype on your device?

  - Easy

- I will now provide an alternative view (radio or checkbox) of the paperless delivery page for you to opt in to paperless delivery on.\

  -

- If you had a magic wand and could make any changes to the way the VA communicates with you what would that be?

  -

- Do you have any additional feedback on the process or terms we discussed today?
