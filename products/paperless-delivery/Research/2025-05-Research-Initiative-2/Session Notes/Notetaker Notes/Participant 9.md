## **First Task: Feelings toward Digital Communication - 5 minutes**

Interest in Digital Communications

- Are you interested in receiving all or some of your documents like the 1095-B tax document, decision letters, or other communications only digitally on VA.gov and not receiving paper copies by mail? Why or why not?

  - If he can consistently get on [va.gov](http://va.gov), it would be a lot easier than mail. But because they are having issues with their accounts, they are reliant on paper mail.

  - Right now it feels like they’re waiting forever to get things in the mail.

- Is there anything that would make you more likely to choose digital communication only and not receive paper mail?

  -

Hesitation to Digital Forms

- Can you tell me a little about how you typically receive important forms or communications? (e.g. through physical mail, email, etc.)

  - Through email or actual phone call

- What made you feel confident or unsure about those experiences? (e.g. privacy, security, reliability, ease of access)

  - Feels like he is sent through loops with digital communication. Hard to transition to the digital world from how they grew up with things - mail and physical things.

- Are there any VA documents or other communication you would prefer to receive by physical mail vs only digitally on your VA.gov account? Why?

  - No. As long as they come by email.

- Would you feel comfortable printing a copy yourself instead of having it mailed to you?

  - Yeah. It make take some time to do that but it is possible.

- Do you have any concerns about switching to digital communication?

  - Slow adopter to digital. Wants to adopt but it’s hard. Used to “old world”.

## **Second Task: Existing Usability and Navigation Mental Models - 5 minutes**

- If you wanted to control how a company sends you emails or texts — where would you navigate to control that? What kinds of settings would you look for?

  - Settings page > “Unsend”

  - Would go to their own email settings to block something they don’t want

- If you wanted to control how a company sends you physical mail — where would you navigate to control that? What kinds of settings would you look for?

  - A menu with “Contact Us” and would just let them know they don’t want any further contact with them.

- Go ahead and log in to your VA.gov account. Now, talk me though where you’d expect to go and what you would expect to see to stop receiving the 1095-B tax form by mail. Please share your thoughts out loud. As you are navigating, if there is a section you would expect to exist, share what you are looking for out loud.
