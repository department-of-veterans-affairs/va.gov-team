# Participant #17 Notes

**Date:** 6/9/2025\
**Time:** 3:30 - 4:15 Eastern\
**Test name:** Paperless Delivery\
**Device:** Laptop\
**Prototype Order:** Checkbox/Radio\

## **Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes**

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

1. What device will you be using today?

   1. Dell laptop

2. What browser are you using?

   1. Internet Explorer

3. First can you tell me if you have a VA.gov account?

   1. She logs in on behalf of her father

4. When do you log into your VA.gov account? What prompts you?

   1. Once every week and a half

   2. For the last 5 years she’s been trying to do everything online. Already has very little paper. 

   3. Logs on whenever she has a question, check on a benefit, get a phone number, etc. 

   4. She does get emails about doctors appointments

   5. She looks at VA’s research online

   6. It’s just another place to go for information - just like you check  your bank, or your health insurance. She just likes staying in touch with what the VA is doing.


## **First Task: Feelings toward Digital Communication - 5 minutes**

Interest in Digital Communications

- Are you interested in receiving all or some of your documents like the 1095-B tax document, decision letters, or other communications only digitally on VA.gov and not receiving paper copies by mail? Why or why not?

  - Yes. She prefers to do everything more digitally. Keeps her more organized. Trying to “go green”. It’s a better use of time to do things online. 

  - “So much of our lives are already online” - travel, looking up a recipe, reading books, etc.

- Is there anything that would make you more likely to choose digital communication only and not receive paper mail?

  - No. Already prefers it. “The world is changing and I’d rather change with it”

Hesitation to Digital Forms

- Can you tell me a little about how you typically receive important forms or communications? (e.g. through physical mail, email, etc.)

  - Digital. Sometimes you’ll get things quicker if it’s digital than in the mail.

- What made you feel confident or unsure about those experiences? (e.g. privacy, security, reliability, ease of access)

  - Heard stories about identity theft but she feels like she is less likely to lose something online than if she had something physically.

  - Her dad is more reluctant to use technology

- Are there any VA documents or other communication you would prefer to receive by physical mail vs only digitally on your VA.gov account? Why?

  - Digital only

- Would you feel comfortable printing a copy yourself instead of having it mailed to you?

  - Yes. If she can print, why would she need to request a physical copy from the VA?

- Do you have any concerns about switching to digital communication?

  - No.


### **Things to watch for:**

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would like to receive digitally

  -

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would NOT like to receive digitally

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would like to continue receiving via paper.


## **Second Task: Existing Usability and Navigation Mental Models - 5 minutes**

- If you wanted to control how a company sends you emails or texts — where would you navigate to control that? What kinds of settings would you look for?

  - Communication Settings. Home page > Contact Us > Do you want to receive digital communication? How frequently? Hit subscribe. 

- If you wanted to control how a company sends you physical mail — where would you navigate to control that? What kinds of settings would you look for?

  - Contact Us/Keeping in touch section

- Go ahead and log in to your VA.gov account. Now, talk me though where you’d expect to go and what you would expect to see to stop receiving the 1095-B tax form by mail. Please share your thoughts out loud. As you are navigating, if there is a section you would expect to exist, share what you are looking for out loud.

  - “Contact Us” at the very top on the banner

  - “Message Us”

  - “Health carer messages” or “Ask VA” if it’s general. 

  - “Contact us online”

  - “Start a new question”

  - “What is the process for changing options of getting mail?”

  - OR she would ask the Chatbot but the chatbot is usually really specific


## **Third Task: Usability and Navigation \[Prototype] - 10 minutes**

- We will now provide a prototype for you to interact with. This prototype has limited functionality so do not expect all buttons to work. As you navigate through the prototype please share any thoughts, frustrations, or points of confusion.

- Navigate to where you would expect to update your delivery preferences.

  - Needed help knowing where and how to login

  - The My VA page looks different than what she has seen before

  - Needed to be prompted to go to Profile

  - Found Communication settings

  - Paperless delivery settings

  - Might come back to the Profile hub and go to notifications after

  - Paperless page: Set which things she wants to be paperless

  - Notifications page: Certain things I want to texted to me

- What is the difference between the pages?

  - Text/email: very current with info she needs to get

  - Not everything may be on email and maybe things that come by the mail so I’d want to update paperless settings.

  - She had a hard time explaining the difference between each one.

    - She thinks she could update delivery/paperless settings on either change

- Based on what you see here, what delivery settings are selected for this account?

  - None are set. Would expect all of these to come in the mail

  - If they want to go paperless, they need to click on on the ones they want digitally.

- What documents would these settings apply to?

  -

- How do you feel about being auto opted in to paperless delivery?

  - Personally she would be fine with it. But it’s not a good idea. People need to have the choice.

- How would you define what ‘paperless settings’ are? (expected response: they will not receive mail but instead will access documents on [VA.gov](http://va.gov))

  -

- Can you think of any other names that would make more sense to you than ‘paperless settings’?

  -

- Now, imagine you would like to change your delivery preferences, talk me through how you would expect to do that.

  - Found 1095-B, liked the Update Saved message

- Update the prototype to receive paper mail.

- After updating your preferences, how confident do you feel that your changes have been saved?

  - Feels confident because Update Saved showed up

- Optional - If participant expected a confirmation: Can you describe what steps you would take if you did not receive a confirmation?

  - She would go to Notification Settings for some reason

  - She might expect to receive an email or text letting her know she updated preferences.

- Now that you updated your preferences, how will you receive your 1095-B?

  -

- When do you think your updated preferences will start taking effect?

  -

- How easy or difficult was it to interact with the prototype on your device?

  -

- I will now provide an alternative view (radio or checkbox) of the paperless delivery page for you to opt in to paperless delivery on.\

- Navigate to where you would expect to update your delivery preferences.

  - Needed to be told where to go

- Based on what you see here, what delivery settings are selected for this account?

  - All paper mail

- Update the prototype to receive paper mail.

- How easy or difficult was it to interact with the prototype on your device?

  - Easy. Could be brighter - the font is small

- Did you notice any features that made it easier or harder for you to complete the tasks?

  - Looks like there are more categories? She isn’t quite sure.

- Which option did you prefer?

  - Radio buttons seems more comprehensive so she likes that. But can’t really remember


## **Post-Task Interview - 3 minutes**

- After seeing this prototype, is there anything that might make you hesitate or decide not to sign up for paperless delivery?

  -

- If you had a magic wand and could make any changes to the way the VA communicates with you what would that be?

  -

- Do you have any additional feedback on the process or terms we discussed today?
