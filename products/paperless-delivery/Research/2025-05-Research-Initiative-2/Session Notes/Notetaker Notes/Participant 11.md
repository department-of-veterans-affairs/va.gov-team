## **Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes**

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

1. What device will you be using today?

   1. Cell phone - iphone 13

2. What browser are you using?

   1. Safari

3. First can you tell me if you have a VA.gov account?

   1. Yes

4. When do you log into your VA.gov account? What prompts you?

   1. All the time. 2-3 times per week.

   2. A lot of it is medical. But he also like reading what the VA has so just explores


## **First Task: Feelings toward Digital Communication - 5 minutes**

Interest in Digital Communications

- Are you interested in receiving all or some of your documents like the 1095-B tax document, decision letters, or other communications only digitally on VA.gov and not receiving paper copies by mail? Why or why not?

  - Yes. “Save the trees”. He finds the apps and online pretty good source to have all that stuff secured in. He will shred paper because it has PII on it.

  - Tries to ask facilities to not sent him mail but they keep sending letters for appointments but the app is sufficient. He’s received reminders after the appointment so it’s not even helpful.

- Is there anything that would make you more likely to choose digital communication only and not receive paper mail?

  - More awareness and education would take them the route of digital. Even younger people (mid 30s) don’t even know there is an app.

  - Awareness and education about the tools because some people just don’t know about them.

Hesitation to Digital Forms

- Can you tell me a little about how you typically receive important forms or communications? (e.g. through physical mail, email, etc.)

  - A lot online. School is online unless he requests a physical copy.

  - Previous job - pay stub, tax docs were all online

- What made you feel confident or unsure about those experiences? (e.g. privacy, security, reliability, ease of access)

  - Links with some kind of verification to access docs

  - Doesn’t want to have to dig around to find where to go -  just wants a direct link

  - Can be hard to find what he’s looking for online and sometimes has to call and ask.

    - Example: really difficult to find medical records on [va.gov](http://va.gov) at first

- Are there any VA documents or other communication you would prefer to receive by physical mail vs only digitally on your VA.gov account? Why?

  - No, I don’t think so. But I should be able to request it.

    - Example: letters in the app, there should be an option to request a paper copy of those letters.

  - Paper copies shouldn’t be sent out right away, only on request

  - A lot of people he knows just don’t know the VA exists. When you first enroll into VA, you should get a paper because some people really need to be aware of that.

  - If I need something, I should just get a notification about it and be able to view it online.

- Would you feel comfortable printing a copy yourself instead of having it mailed to you?

  - Yes. 

- Do you have any concerns about switching to digital communication?

  - Not for him, no. But concerned for other Veterans.


### **Things to watch for:**

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would like to receive digitally

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would NOT like to receive digitally

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would like to continue receiving via paper.


## **Second Task: Existing Usability and Navigation Mental Models - 5 minutes**

- If you wanted to control how a company sends you emails or texts — where would you navigate to control that? What kinds of settings would you look for?

  - Profile > Preference tab > Do you want email communication? If yes, then you can type in your email. Same with text.

- If you wanted to control how a company sends you physical mail — where would you navigate to control that? What kinds of settings would you look for?

  - Same place > Preference tab > Do you want physical mail/physical copies of your records? If yes, confirm address.

- Go ahead and log in to your VA.gov account. Now, talk me though where you’d expect to go and what you would expect to see to stop receiving the 1095-B tax form by mail. Please share your thoughts out loud. As you are navigating, if there is a section you would expect to exist, share what you are looking for out loud.

  - Clicked the name drop down > Profile

  - Got logged out and had to log back in

  - Contact Information (didn’t scroll all the way down)

    - All of his info is already there so he said probably just add preferences to that page.


## **Third Task: Usability and Navigation \[Prototype] - 10 minutes**

- We will now provide a prototype for you to interact with. This prototype has limited functionality so do not expect all buttons to work. As you navigate through the prototype please share any thoughts, frustrations, or points of confusion.

- Navigate to where you would expect to update your delivery preferences.

  - Tried to click drop down

  - Clicked the profile link on My VA instead

  - Still wanted to click Contact Info but couldn’t

  - Needed to be prompted to keep scrolling and saw Communication settings

  - Clicked on Notification Settings by accident

    - Clicked 

    - Asked where the option to receive appointment reminders by paper was because he receives those.

  - Clicked on Paperless Delivery

  - Seemed like he hadn’t seen the Notifications Settings page before

- What’s the difference between a notification and a document?

  - Document - in depth info

  - Notification - “hey, you have an appt date

  - Said they would expect to enroll in paperless and change notifications in one place, one page. Doesn’t want to have to go to two places.

    - Example: his doctor sends him a whole packet with everything in there every time. Doesn’t have the option to tell the provider to not to send by mail. Wants an option to tell his providers to just send him a notification when the results are ready and he can just view them online.

- Based on what you see here, what delivery settings are selected for this account?

  - Enroll in digital delivery: email or text aka not physical

- What documents would these settings apply to?

  - Hesitated. Appointment notifications, education status for GI bill, messages from providers, medical records, medication.

- How do you feel about being auto opted in to paperless delivery?

  - He wouldn’t recommend that. Some Veterans still rely on physical mail. People should be given the choice.

- How would you define what ‘paperless settings’ are? (expected response: they will not receive mail but instead will access documents on [VA.gov](http://va.gov))

  - Text, email, phone call

- Can you think of any other names that would make more sense to you than ‘paperless settings’?

  - No

- Now, imagine you would like to change your delivery preferences, talk me through how you would expect to do that.

  - Have a button that takes you to Communication Preferences if it is going to live on a separate page.

  - Profile’s a personal but they don’t go there very often - they are in different parts of [va.gov](http://va.gov) more often so aren’t used to where Profile things when.

- Update the prototype to receive paper mail.

- After updating your preferences, how confident do you feel that your changes have been saved?

  - Saw the Update Saved design.

  - He would have a

- Optional - If participant expected a confirmation: Can you describe what steps you would take if you did not receive a confirmation?

  - He would prefer a button that asks him to save. Then still a notification that tell him it was saved. He will navigate away from a page and go back to it to make sure it saved correctly.

    - Example: filed Chapter 35 for his wife. It was very very painful. Didn’t know he had to create an entirely new profile, link it to him and then file Chapter 35 under that new profile. So complicated. Took him a week to figure out.

- Now that you updated your preferences, how will you receive your 1095-B?

  -

- When do you think your updated preferences will start taking effect?

  -

- How easy or difficult was it to interact with the prototype on your device?

  - Fair

- I will now provide an alternative view (radio or checkbox) of the paperless delivery page for you to opt in to paperless delivery on.\

- Navigate to where you would expect to update your delivery preferences.

- Based on what you see here, what delivery settings are selected for this account?

  -

- Update the prototype to receive paper mail.

  - He thinks he would just uncheck it. Kind of had to guess what it actually would do when he unchecks.

  - He thinks it needs to be more explicitly - enroll in paperless, enroll in paper. 

    - He would go back to the two options. And just include it on the notifications page. 

  - Felt like the VA was yelling at him with “no more paper mail”. Thought that was funny.

- How easy or difficult was it to interact with the prototype on your device?

  -

- Did you notice any features that made it easier or harder for you to complete the tasks?

  -

- Which option did you prefer?

## **Post-Task Interview - 3 minutes**

- After seeing this prototype, is there anything that might make you hesitate or decide not to sign up for paperless delivery?

  - I don’t think so. But other Veterans may have a hard time just because they aren’t digitally savvy.

- If you had a magic wand and could make any changes to the way the VA communicates with you what would that be?

  - Send paper and digital notifications to educate people about paperless efforts with support on how to do it - it’s all about awareness and education. 

- Do you have any additional feedback on the process or terms we discussed today?
