# **Paperless Delivery Conversation Guide**

## **Moderator logistics**

### **2-3 days before the session**

- Review VA Platform's [Research Checklist](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-checklist).

- Complete any project-specific setup tasks for this study (List them below)

Step 1 **Assign and confirm notetaker(s)**

- This should include a member of your team but could include others. Ask your notetaker(s) to review [guidance on taking notes](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/notetaker-guidelines). If you can’t find someone to take notes, Perigean is available to assist. [Learn how to prepare for Perigean to take notes.](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/how-to-prepare-for-perigean-to-take-notes)


Step 2 

- **Prepare for note-taking**

- Create a “session-notes” folder within your research study Github folder and store each session as a .md document. Copy the conversation guide over to your .md file before each session so that you have a structured way to capture your notes.


Step 3

- **Invite observers**

- Invite your team and stakeholders to sessions. [Limit your observers](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-safety-and-emergency-exit-strategies#%5BinlineExtension%5DCreating-a-safe-space-for-participants) to 3-4 per session so participants aren’t overwhelmed. You should empower participants by allowing them to decide if they are comfortable having observers. Ask observers to review information about [observer guidelines and attendance etiquette.](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/observer-guidelines)

Step 4

* **Prepare as moderator**

* Be familiar with the conversation guide, study implement(s), and prototype(s). Review [tips on moderating, guidelines for recording sessions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/conducting-research-sessions),and guidance on [participant and researcher safety and exit strategies](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-safety-and-emergency-exit-strategies).



### **Day of the session**

- Use [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/messages/C40B45NJK/details/) in Slack for real-time feedback from observers.

- Mute your Slack notifications.

- Send out the [observer instructions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Observer-guidelines.1622311177.html) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel)).

- Keep handy the [Tech set-up checklist](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/tech-set-up-checklist) and [Troubleshooting Research Sessions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/troubleshooting-for-va-gov-research-sessions-in-pr) in case the participant needs help during the session.


### **Starting the session**

- In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute.

- In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked

- Make sure you have transcriptions enabled

- Check your \[screensharing setup] and share permissions for participants.

- When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro\*


## **Intro - 5 minutes**

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Raquel. I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...

I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.

- Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.

- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?

  - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.

  - If yes: Admit observers.

  - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)

  - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth

- Today we're going to talk about digital communications in place of paper. You'll be interacting with a prototype today. This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.

- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.

  - Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

- Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences? One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image. Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not, but we like to ask ahead of time. At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.

  - Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?

  - If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.

_Start recording._

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

- Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?


## **Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes**

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

1. First can you tell me if you have a VA.gov account?

2. When do you log into your VA.gov account? What prompts you?

3. What device are you using today?

4. What browser are you using?


## **First Task: Feelings toward Digital Communication - 5 minutes**

Interest in Digital Communications
    
- Are you interested in receiving all or some of your documents like the 1095-B tax document, decision letters, or other communications only digitally on VA.gov and not recieve paper copies by mail? Why or why not?

- Is there anything that would make you more likely to choose digital communication only and not receive paper mail?

Hesitation to Digital Forms

- Can you tell me a little about how you typically receive important forms or communications? (e.g. through physical mail, email, etc.)

- What made you feel confident or unsure about those experiences? (e.g. privacy, security, reliability, ease of access)

- Are there any VA documents or other communication you would prefer to receive by physical mail vs only digitally on your VA.gov account? Why?

- Would you feel comfortable printing a copy yourself instead of having it mailed to you?

- Do you have any concerns about switching to digital communication?


### **Things to watch for:**

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would like to receive digitally

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would NOT like to receive digitally

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would like to continue receiving via paper.


## **Second Task: Existing Usability and Navigation Mental Models - 5 minutes**

- If you wanted to control how a company sends you emails or texts — where would you navigate to control that? What kinds of settings would you look for?

- If you wanted to control how a company sends you physical mail — where would you navigate to control that? What kinds of settings would you look for?

- Go ahead and log in to your VA.gov account. Now, talk me though where you’d expect to go and what you would expect to see to stop receiving the 1095-B tax form by mail. Please share your thoughts out loud. As you are navigating, if there is a section you would expect to exist, share what you are looking for out loud.


### **Things to watch for:**

- Pay attention for if the participant mentions notificaion settings or paperless settings.

- Note the paths the participants took to update their delivery preferences.

- Note what words the participants were looking for (e.g. notifications/paperless/mail)

- Did the participant seem confused when navigating to where they would imagine they would update their delivery preferences?

- Did the participant’s expectations match our designs, how did they differ?


## **Third Task: Usability and Navigation \[Prototype] - 10 minutes**

- We will now provide a prototype for you to interact with. This prototype has limited functionality so do not expect all buttons to work. As you navigate through the prototype please share any thoughts, frustrations, or points of confusion.

- Navigate to where you would expect to update your delivery preferences.

- Based on what you see here, what delivery settings are selected for this account?

- What documents would these settings apply to?
  
- How do you feel about being auto opted in to paperless delivery?

- How would you define what ‘paperless settings’ are? (expected response: they will not receive mail but instead will access documents on VA.gov)

- How would you define what 'notification settings' are? How is that different than notification settings?

- Can you think of any other names that would make more sense to you than ‘paperless settings’?

- Now, imagine you would like to change your delivery preferences, talk me through how you would expect to do that.

- Update the prototype to recieve paper mail.

- After updating your preferences, how confident do you feel that your changes have been saved?

- How would you would confirm that your changes have been saved?

- Optional - If participant expected a confirmation: Can you describe what steps you would take if you did not receive a confirmation?

- Now that you updated your preferences how will you recieve your 1095-B?

- When do you think your updated preferences will start taking effect?
  
- How easy or difficult was it to interact with the prototype on your device?


- I will now provide an alternative view (radio or checkbox) of the paperless delivery page for you to opt in to paperless delivery on.

- Navigate to where you would expect to update your delivery preferences.

- Based on what you see here, what delivery settings are selected for this account?

- Update the prototype to recieve paper mail.

- How easy or difficult was it to interact with the prototype on your device?

- Did you notice any features that made it easier or harder for you to complete the tasks?

- Which option did you prefer?


### **Things to watch for:**

- Was the participant able to navigate to the paperless delivery preferences without assistance?

- Were they confident they were in the right place?

- Did they encounter any painpoints, frustrations or confusion?

- Was the participant able to update their delivery preferences to only receive forms digitally?

- Does the term “paperless” clearly communicate to the participant?

- Did they understand the copy associated with the radio button and check box?

- Were they confident that their changes had been saved?

- Did they expect confirmation of their changes? What type of confirmation?

- Did they prefer the radio buttons or checkbox design?


## **Post-Task Interview - 3 minutes**

- After seeing this prototype, is there anything that might make you hesitate or decide not to sign up for paperless delivery?

- If you had a magic wand and could make any changes to the way the VA communicates with you what would that be?

- What would you expect to see if you were not enrolled in health care?

- Do you have any additional feedback on the process or terms we discussed today?


## **Consent to use video clips**

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners? Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.

  - If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?


## **Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes**

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!


## **Emergency Exit**

In the rare case of an emergency during a session, we will convey the following session to wrap up the session. Then follow the guidance [found on the emergency exit VA page.](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-safety-and-emergency-exit-strategies#Sample-exit-strategies)

**Out of questions**: We have covered all the questions I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback.
