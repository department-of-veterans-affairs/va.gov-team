## **Background**

Currently, Veterans and other claimants receive claims and appeals decisions by paper mail. They can also download the decision letters for disability compensation claims on[ VA.gov](http://va.gov). For other claim types, Veterans and other claimants may learn on[ VA.gov](http://va.gov) or in the VAHB mobile app that a decision has been made, but they have to wait an additional 7-10 days to learn what the decision was by paper mail.

Reducing the need to mail paper represents a significant opportunity for cost savings. Transitioning to digitize all documents for Veterans is a major initiative that will require substantial time and manpower. Currently, only two documents—the disability compensation decision letter and the 1095-B—are available digitally.

As more informational documents are converted to digital formats, it would be beneficial to establish a central location where veterans can opt in to paperless delivery for these documents in the authenticated Veteran experiences.

### **OCTO Priorities**

This initiative would support OCTO’s first Objective and its first two key results.\
\
O1: VA’s digital  experiences are the  easiest and most efficient  way to access VA health  care and benefits. \
\
1.1  Improve satisfaction with our web and mobile products by 5 points.  \
1.2   We have reduced the total time Veterans spend waiting for a response from our digital experiences by 50%, towards a goal of less than 4 seconds per transaction.


### **Veteran Journey**

This feature would fit into the Veteran’s journey as they onboard to VA.gov, as they enroll in different benefits, and as they determine how they want to receive communication from VA.gov.


## **Research Goals**

### Design Question: 

How might we help Veterans receive the documents they want, the way they want?


### Research Goals:

- Do the presented first release designs help Veterans navigate to and make updates to their paperless settings?

- Do the presented futures state designs help Veterans navigate to and make updates to their paperless settings?


### **Outcome**

This research will provide insight into 

- Veterans appetite for paperless forms

- Veterans mental models for paperless delivery IA

- the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed design


### **Research questions**

1. Are users interested in receiving some or all forms or communications digitally instead of by mail?

2. What factors influence Veterans' trust in digital document delivery?

3. Are there any documents they would be hesitant to receive digitally? Why?

4. How do Veterans perceive the security of their data in paperless systems?

5. Where do Veterans expect to find and update their paperless delivery settings for the 1095-B?

6. Can Veterans easily navigate to the section where they would update their paperless delivery settings without assistance?

7. Does the Veteran experience any pain points or confusion when navigating to or making updates to their paperless delivery settings?

8. Does the word “paperless” clearly tell Veterans that they won’t get paper mail and will need to go online to see their documents? If not, what terminology would they prefer? Paperfree delivery? Online documents?

9. After updating their paperless delivery settings, do users feel confident that their changes have been saved and will take effect?

10. Do users understand what will happen when they make a selection? Do they think they’re opting in or out? And is that the same as what the system actually does?

11. Do Veterans feel more comfortable with radio buttons or check boxes as their paperless option selection method?

12. After signing up for paperless delivery, what kind of confirmation or follow-up communication do users expect?

13. Are users reassured by email confirmations?

14. Do they expect reminders or notifications for new digital documents?

15. What barriers, beyond technical ability, might prevent Veterans from opting for paperless delivery (e.g., trust, perceived complexity)?

16. How do Veterans currently store and access important documents, and how does that influence their willingness to go paperless?


### **Hypothesis**

If Veterans are provided with paperless settings within their profile, then they will update their paperless settings confidently and without external direction. 

Veterans may require additional support or guidance to adopt paperless settings confidently.


## **Methodology**

For this research we plan to start the session with a few **semi-structured interview** questions to understand Veteran’s past experiences with paperless delivery in similar systems and their sentiment toward it. 

These questions will be followed by light **contextual inquiry** where we plan to observe where Veterans would expect to set up paperless delivery for a specific form on VA.gov. This will help us gain understanding into the Veteran’s mental models and uncover usability barriers.

We will then transition to **Usability testing** to determine if Veterans are able to update paperless settings for the 1095-B form using our prototype. At this stage we will also conduct some **A/B** testing to determine usability and preference of radio buttons vs checkboxes and content in particular paperless vs Paper-free delivery vs online documents.


### **Location**

This research will be conducted over zoom.

## **Recruitment**

### **Recruitment approach**

We want to capture a wide range of experience in the group of Veterans we select. These are some of the areas we want to capture:

1. **Various technical ability** (mix of benefits application method)

2. **Mobile users and desktop users**

3. **Various levels of Familiarity with paperless delivery** (screener question - Have you come across an option to receive certain forms or communications digitally instead of by mail when interacting with a government agency, healthcare provider, or financial institution)

4. **Various levels of Internet stability and access** (remote location, cognitive disability)

5. **Various location accessibility- possible difficulty receiving mail** (lives in remote location)

6. **Various cognitive ability** (level of education, cognitive disability)

Because we want a total of **14** participants we will recruit for **18** participants.

**Recruitment criteria**

For this research we will meet with at least **14** individuals with VA.gov accounts and recruit for **18**. They will represent a mix of Veterans and Caregivers. We will use Perigean to recruit for the following three cohorts.

- Cohort 1:(5) Veterans with experience with products that may offer paperless

- Cohort 2: (5) Veterans who do not have or are unaware of experience with products that may offer paperless

- Cohort 3: (4) Caregivers of Veterans

For Cohorts 1 and 2 combined, we would like to follow the following distribution as closely as possible:

- 5 Veterans Age 55+

- 5 Veterans with Cognitive disabilities

- 5 Mobile users

- 5 Veterans living in Rural areas

- 3 Veterans without a degree

- 3 Veterans with other than honorable discharge

- 1 Veterans that are Women

- 3 Black or African American 

- 2 Hispanic

- 1 Asian

- 1 Native, American Indian or Alaska Native
