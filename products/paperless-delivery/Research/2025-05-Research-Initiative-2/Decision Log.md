### **Recommended design changes** 

Based on the results of the paperless delivery research conducted with Veterans we propose that the following directions, changes, and enhancements be implemented to the paperless design.

### **Recommendation 1:** Make it clearer which documents will be included in paperless delivery.****Value: **High** Effort: **Low**

**Finding RQ10:** However, a few participants thought they were opting in to stop receiving ALL paper documents and paper alerts when in reality they were only selecting one document (1095-B).\
\
**Finding RQ11:** Overall, both designs were usable. Including clear labels and visual grouping seemed to help improve usability for either option.

**Quotes:**

> “I think I like checkboxes… it links all the categories together… easier to read.” -P18

> “Like, per category. Like, I don't want you to send me my appointment notifications...” -P7

> “That means that everything. I wouldn't get any more paper copies. It would all come through text or email.” -P10


### **Recommendation 2:** Add explanations to help Veterans understand the difference between a mailed notification and a mailed document or update.****Value: High Effort: Low

**Finding RQ7:** Others were confused about the difference between contact info, notifications, and paperless delivery.

**Quotes:**

> “I think paperless settings is kind of like a setting on its own… You opt in.” -P16

> (When asked what paperless delivery would apply to) “So I would say my notifications, my appointment notifications, my education status for GI Bill or VR and E or whatever. I'm using my messages from providers appointments.” -P11

> “Because I think this page is kind of cumbersome anyway. I think this could be laid out a lot better because it's like, I think there should be options for each. \[text, email, paper]” -P13


### **Recommendation 3:** Send an email when new documents are ready, and include a link to help Veterans get to them easily.****Value: High Effort: High

**Finding RQ13:** Yes, Veterans expect to be notified when new documents are available digitally. Most prefer receiving alerts by **email, text message, or both**, depending on their communication preferences. Many emphasized that **text alerts help them act faster**, especially when emails may get overlooked in crowded inboxes. 

**Finding RQ14:** While most Veterans are comfortable using digital systems, several expressed concerns about trust, security, or the need for clearer communication. Some worried about missing documents due to unclear labeling or lack of notifications, while others mentioned wanting proof of changes or confirmation. Concerns about overlooked emails and uncertain system reliability also contributed to hesitation.

**Quotes:**

> “A simple email to my main email address would be great.” -P21

> “Go to this link below so you can see all the notes and the results. And then you click on there, sign into my VA and it takes you straight to the documentation.” -P11


### **Recommendation 4:** Give Veterans a clearer confirmation message so they know exactly which settings were saved and what will happen next.****Value: High Effort: High (can probably implement now)

**Finding RQ9:** Veterans trusted the change but often double-checked to confirm.

**Quotes:**

> “And then a notification says, are you sure this is the preference? Say, or something that describes the preference.” - P11

> “I think I would have expected a little pop up window to be like, hey, you're going back to paper. Are you sure? And I'm like, yes, I do want paper. And that's it.” -P7


### **Recommendation 5:** Update wording to communicate that Veterans can modify their settings at any time.****Value: Low Effort: Low

**Finding RQ7:** One participant wasn’t sure if they’d be able to change their preferences again after updating their settings.

**Quotes:**

> “Well, it says update saved with a check mark. Well, I. I feel pretty confident. But what I don't see here is what if I change my mind? I gotta go back to my father and he says, no, no, no, I want paper.” -P18


### **Recommendation 6:** Make it clear why Veterans will always get their documents online and why there isn’t a paper-only option. Value: Low Effort: Low

**Finding RQ7:** Some expected to see an option to receive only paper mail, which wasn’t available.

**Quotes:**

> “Do you wish to receive only paper or only digital correspondence or both or whatever.” -P11

> “Because right here you're saying, send me both paper and unless you're going to put a little another circle around here and put. Just send paper only.” -P4


## **ON HOLD**

### **Recommendation 7:** Provide in application guidance with links to help users navigate to paperless settings. Value: High Effort: High (Dependent on AuthEx team not able to do now)

**Finding RQ14:** While most Veterans are comfortable using digital systems, some worried about missing documents due to unclear labeling or lack of notifications, while others mentioned wanting proof of changes or confirmation. Concerns about overlooked emails and uncertain system reliability also contributed to hesitation.

**Quotes:**

> “Go to this link below so you can see all the notes and the results. And then you click on there, sign into my VA and it takes you straight to the documentation.” -P11

> “When I go directly to Settings, something will pop up and say that, you know, you can get this paperless. You don't have to.” -P19


### **Recommendation 8:** 

### **Group the contact information, notification settings, and paperless delivery options closer together on the profile page to align with Veteran organization expectations.**

#### Value: High Effort: High (Dependent on AuthEx team not able to do now)

**Finding QR6:** Some expected their delivery preferences to be located closer to their contact information.

**Quotes:**

> “I do wish it had been up underneath the contact information, but I mean, it's not the end of the world. I found it still.” -P7


### **Recommendation 9: Send a text when new documents are ready, and include a link to help Veterans get to them easily.**

#### Value: High Effort: High

**Finding RQ13:** Yes, Veterans expect to be notified when new documents are available digitally. Most prefer receiving alerts by **email, text message, or both**, depending on their communication preferences. Many emphasized that **text alerts help them act faster**, especially when emails may get overlooked in crowded inboxes. 

**Finding RQ14:** While most Veterans are comfortable using digital systems, several expressed concerns about trust, security, or the need for clearer communication. Some worried about missing documents due to unclear labeling or lack of notifications, while others mentioned wanting proof of changes or confirmation. Concerns about overlooked emails and uncertain system reliability also contributed to hesitation.

**Quotes:**

> “I honestly prefer a text notification… if it’s just in my email, the odds of that thing getting lost in there…” -P7
> “If there’s new communication… it would be great to receive a text just… notifying you, like, ‘Hey, you have new communication on_ [_VA.gov_](http://va.gov)_.’” -P16
> “Go to this link below so you can see all the notes and the results. And then you click on there, sign into my VA and it takes you straight to the documentation.” -P11


### **Recommendation 10: Update the future design so it supports bulk selection.**

### Value: High Effort: High Relevance: Future

**Finding RQ11:** Some participants expressed that they would like the option to bulk select paperless option settings when interacting with the prototypes.

**Quotes:**

> “I'm assuming that each of these bold headers here would be other things too, like medical appointments, and so that they would have the option to. To shut that off or I would default it as off, actually.” -P8

> “There could probably be like an all paperless delivery and then maybe something that's like, if there's a specific form you want mailed to you, maybe go to that specific page. You know what I mean?” -P13

> “I think this is great that you give the options, but instead of having somebody having to check 18 of them or however many there are any. If you. Above Health care. You had make make all notifications or make, make, you know, switch to paperless delivery.” -P2


### **Recommendation 11: Send an email confirmation with a link whenever settings are changed.**

#### Value: Low Effort: High

**Finding RQ9:** Veterans trusted the change but often double-checked to confirm.\
\
**Finding RQ12:** Most Veterans expect to receive a confirmation message after changing their delivery settings—especially via email. Some prefer a message that includes details about what was changed and when. This helps build trust in the system and serves as a reference point for future verification.

**Quotes:**

> “I’ve gotten an email that says you have selected paperless delivery for this account.” -P18
> “I think there’s one that says, ‘If you didn’t make these changes, please notify us.’”-P2_


### **Recommendation 12: Send a text confirmation with a link whenever settings are changed.**Value: Low Effort: High

**Finding RQ9:** Veterans trusted the change but often double-checked to confirm.\
\
**Finding RQ12:** Most Veterans expect to receive a confirmation message after changing their delivery settings—especially via email. Some prefer a message that includes details about what was changed and when. This helps build trust in the system and serves as a reference point for future verification.

**Quotes:**

> “Maybe a text or an email… ‘This is to confirm that you have selected to go paperless for the 1095-B form.’” -P17
> “I think there’s one that says, ‘If you didn’t make these changes, please notify us.’”-P2


### **Additional Findings and Recommendations**

### **Recommendation 13: Simplify the login experience**

**Finding:** Some Veterans have difficulty signing into VA.gov, which can block access to digital documents.

> “Somehow I got locked out and I can't get back into it and I guess I gotta open up a whole new account and for some reason it won't take my phone number. ” - P9


### **Recommendation 14: Offer paperless delivery of all notifications, reminders, and documents**

**Finding:** The majority of participants expressed a high level of enthusiasm for opting into paperless mail options.****

> “You know, they need to catch up with the times.” - P4

> “They'll have somebody… print that all out, then send it to me in the mail, which, you know, that don't make sense to me when I can just go to … VA.gov” - P10

> “But then I get in the mail a week or so later, these little cards, and you open it, and I gripe every time I do, because I right now, I'm having quite a few appointments. It's postage wasted. I already know about the appointment.” -P3


### **Recommendation 15: For all digital documents on VA.gov ensure that Veterans have the option to print.**

**Finding:** Most participants who wanted paper documents would rather print them themselves than receive them by mail.

> “I print things out and bring them with me from the VA, because some of the medications have names that I'm not a doctor, so it's very hard to pronounce.” -P19


### **Recommendation 16: Provide a way for Veterans to view and compare their lab results online.**

**Finding:** One participant shared that they wanted to be able to compare their lab results online like they currently do with their physical copies.

> “So it's nice to be able to, like, literally look at my last one and this one and be like, hey, this level was high on both of them.” -P7


### **Recommendation 17: Allow a way for one account to have multiple logins.**

**Finding:** Veterans want options to easily share VA documents with caregivers or family members.

> “I think it would be nice to develop a surrogacy for accessing an account. For example, I recently needed to access my husband's. Well, it takes his face... In order to access it.” -P3


### **Recommendation 18: In addition to offering paperless delivery, also give people the option to schedule deliveries to different addresses at specific times**.

**Finding:** Veterans who move frequently or travel have trouble managing mailed documents.

> “I just came back… yesterday and… the mailman left a one of those plastic U S postal boxes next to my door filled with stuff. And a lot of it was, you know, stuff I just tossed immediately.” -P3


### **Recommendation 19: Create notifications and other alerts to inform Veterans of where there is new information and guide them to take action.**

**Finding:** Some Veterans are concerned that if documents are only sent digitally, they may miss something important.

> “Discoverability of some documents online is… It can be really difficult. So you need some kind of clear communication. If you need me to do something, give me a link.” -P11


### **Recommendation 20: Allow Veterans to opt out of paper notifications.**

**Finding:** Most Veterans want a text or email when new documents or updates are available on [VA.gov](http://va.gov).

> “Well, first of all, if you receive an email with good instructions, that's very beneficial.” - P6


### **Recommendation 21: Allow a way for representatives at facilities to update Veterans paperless notifications.**

**Finding:** Some Veterans have tried to sign up for paperless delivery at VA facilities.

> “Yeah, even in the office, like when you go to see your doctor” - P6
> “Yeah, I thought because I signed up for text and email notifications that they wouldn't send me mail about it” -P7


### **Recommendation 22: Find more ways to reach Veterans who do not have a** [**VA.gov**](http://va.gov) **account.**

**Finding:** One Veteran shared that he had many friends who did not know about the VA but who he believed were eligible for benefits.

> “A lot of members in the military do not know about the va, like legitimately. Those. They don't know that the VA exists even..” - P11


### **Recommendation 23: Move the location of the menu on the mobile app.**

**Finding:** Most participants looked for settings in the drop down in the upper right hand corner. In the Mobile view of [VA.gov](http://va.gov) the menu is put in the top right corner and the account drop down is moved to the left. This caused many people to look in the menu for settings.


### **Recommendation 24: Start tracking how long it takes mail to get to a Veteran and use that information as a value proposition.**

**Finding:** Digital is seen as faster, but some worry the information might not be updated promptly.

> “Sometimes you'll get things quicker digitally than if it's mailed.” - P17


## **Next Steps**

1. Implement design changes identified from feedback to our MVP paperless delivery settings. These recommended design changes are highlighted in the decision log.

2. Share other findings with other teams at the VA.
