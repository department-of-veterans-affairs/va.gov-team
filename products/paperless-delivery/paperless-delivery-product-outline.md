# **Paperless Delivery**

## **Global Settings for Paperless Delivery Product Outline**

### **Overview**

The Iterate, Innovate, and Run (IIR) team is leading an initiative to allow va.gov users to opt-in to Paperless Delivery for certain items. The IIR team plans to implement a new section on va.gov that other teams can leverage and add their own Paperless Delivery items to. 


### **Problem Statement(s)**

1. The VA spends millions of dollars each year printing and sending physical mail to Veterans and beneficiaries

2. VA.gov users don’t have a way to opt-in to Paperless Delivery for any va.gov products

3. There is no centralized place for users to manage Paperless Delivery settings

How might we statement: How might we reduce the amount of physical mail the VA sends while still delivering the information that mail contains in a reliable and transparent way.


### **Desired User Outcomes**

1. Veterans can easily find where to manage their Paperless Delivery settings

2. Veterans can easily manage their Paperless Delivery settings

3. Veterans know the difference between Paperless Delivery settings and Notification Settings

4. Veterans understand the value of accessing items digitally

5. Veterans know when an item becomes available digitally


### **Undesired User Outcomes**

1. Veterans don’t know where to find their Paperless Delivery settings

2. Veterans don’t know what items are included in Paperless Delivery settings

3. Veterans don’t know how to opt-out of Paperless Delivery settings

4. Veterans don’t know when their items are available digitally

5. Paperless Delivery gets scattered across va.gov and Veterans cannot find them


### **Desired Business Outcomes**

1. The VA spends less on printing and sending physical mail

2. Other va.gov teams start adding Paperless Delivery options for their own products and storing them in the global Paperless Delivery settings.


### **Undesired Business Outcomes**

1. After a year, less than 3 products have Paperless Delivery options

2. There is no centralized place for teams to surface Paperless Delivery options for users

3. Different teams rebuild different implementations of Paperless Delivery settings
