## **Background**

Currently, Veterans and other claimants receive claims and appeals decisions by paper mail. They can also download the decision letters for disability compensation claims on[ VA.gov](http://va.gov). For other claim types, Veterans and other claimants may learn on[ VA.gov](http://va.gov) or in the VAHB mobile app that a decision has been made, but they have to wait an additional 7-10 days to learn what the decision was.

Reducing the need to mail paper also represents a significant opportunity for cost savings. Transitioning to digital forms for veterans is a major initiative that will require substantial time and manpower. Currently, only one form—the disability compensation decision letter—is available digitally, with the 1095-B soon to follow.

As more forms are converted to digital formats, it would be beneficial to establish a central location where veterans can opt in to paperless delivery for these documents in the authenticated Veteran experiences.

### **OCTO Priorities**

This initiative would support OCTO’s first Objective and its first two key results.\
\
O1: VA’s digital  experiences are the  easiest and most efficient  way to access VA health  care and benefits. \
\
1.1  Improve satisfaction with our web and mobile products by 5 points.  \
1.2   We have reduced the total time Veterans spend waiting for a response from our digital experiences by 50%, towards a goal of less than 4 seconds per transaction.


### **Veteran Journey**

This feature would fit into the Veteran’s journey as they onboard to VA.gov and as they determine how they want to receive communication from VA.gov.


## **Research Goals**

### Design Question: 

How might we help Veterans receive the documents they want, the way they want?


### Research Goals:

- Do the presented first release designs help Veterans navigate to and make updates to their paperless settings?

- Do the presented futures state designs help Veterans navigate to and make updates to their paperless settings?


### **Outcome**

This research will provide insight into 

- Veterans appetite for paperless forms

- Veterans mental models for paperless delivery IA

- the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed design


### **Research questions**

1. Are users interested in receiving some or all forms or communications digitally instead of by mail?

2. Are there any forms they would be hesitant to receive digitally? Why?

3. Where do Veterans expect to find and update their paperless delivery settings for a specific form?

4. Can Veterans easily navigate to the section where they would update their paperless delivery settings without assistance?

5. Are there any pain points or confusion when navigating to or making updates in the system?

6. Does the term “paperless” clearly communicate what Veterans can expect? If not, what terminology would they prefer?

7. After updating their paperless delivery settings, do users feel confident that their changes have been saved and will take effect?

8. After signing up for paperless delivery, what kind of confirmation or follow-up communication do users expect?

For conversation guide: Using your VA.gov navigate to where you think you would be able to choose that option.


### **Hypothesis**

If Veterans are provided with a paperless experience similar to market standards, then they will update their paperless settings confidently and without external direction. 


## **Methodology**

For this research we plan to start the session with a few **semi-structured interview** questions to understand Veteran’s past experiences with paperless delivery in similar systems and their sentiment toward it. 

These questions will be followed by light **contextual inquiry** where we plan to observe where Veterans would expect to set up paperless delivery for a specific form on VA.gov. This will help us gain understanding into the Veteran’s mental models and uncover usability barriers.

We will then transition to **Usability testing** to determine if Veterans are able to update paperless settings for the 1095-B form using our prototype and if they understand when and how they will be updated where there is a new form available and 


### **Location**

This research will be conducted over zoom.

## **Recruitment**

### **Recruitment approach**

We want to capture a wide range of experience in the group of Veterans we select. These are some of the areas we want to capture:

1. **Various technical ability** (screener question- “Have you come across an option to receive certain forms or communications digitally instead of by mail when interacting with a government agency, healthcare provider, or financial institution”)

2. **Mobile users and desktop users**

3. **Various levels of Familiarity with paperless delivery** (screener question - Have you come across an option to receive certain forms or communications digitally instead of by mail when interacting with a government agency, healthcare provider, or financial institution)

4. **Various levels of Internet stability and access** (remote location, cognitive disability)

5. **Various location accessibility- possible difficulty receiving mail** (lives in remote location)

6. **Various cognitive ability** (level of education, cognitive disability)

Because we want a total of **14** participants we will recruit for **18** participants.

**Recruitment criteria**

For this research we will meet with at least **14** individuals with VA.gov accounts and recruit for **18**. They will represent a mix of Veterans and Caregivers. We will use Perigean to recruit for the following four cohorts.

- Cohort 1:(5) Veterans with experience with products that may offer paperless

- Cohort 2: (5) Veterans who do not have or are unaware of experience with products that may offer paperless

- Cohort 3: (4) Caregivers of Veterans

For Cohorts 1 and 2, we would like to follow the following distribution as closely as possible:

- 5 Veterans Age 55+

- 5 Veterans with Cognitive disabilities

- 5 Mobile users

- 5 Veterans living in Rural areas

- 3 Veterans without a degree

- 3 Veterans with other than honorable discharge

- 2 Veterans of Immigrant origin

- 1 Veterans that are Women

- 1 Expat

- 3 Black or African American 

- 2 Hispanic

- 1 Biracial 

- 1 Asian

- 1 Native, American Indian or Alaska Native

For cohort 3 (Caretakers) we would like to follow this distribution:

- 2 Caretakers Age 55+

- 2 Mobile users

- 1 Caretaker living in Rural area

- 1 Caretaker without a degree

- 1 Caretaker that is a Woman

- 1 Black or African American 

- 3 Caretakers who are also enrolled in VA healthcare

## **Timeline**

TBD

Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person.


### **Prepare**

TBD

When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session.

- Pilot participant email: Mike?

- Date and time of pilot session: TBD


### **Research sessions**

- Planned dates of research: TBD


### **Length of sessions**

- Session length: 45 min

- Buffer time between sessions: 1 hour

- Maximum Sessions per day: 3


### **Availability**

TBD

When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time. _Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S._

Please request enough dates and at _least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants_. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; _12 time slots for 6 participants_). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.


## **Team Roles**

In the Slack study channel, send an email and primary phone number for the moderator. Send emails only for the notetaker, accessibility specialist, and observers. If you need Perigean to take notes for you, indicate that next to Notetaker.

- Moderator: Raquel Eisele

- Research guide writing and task development (usually but not always same as moderator): Raquel Eisele

- Participant recruiting & screening: Perigean

- Project point of contact: Raquel Eisele

- Participant(s) for pilot test: TBD

- Note-takers: Megan Commons

- Observers: List the names of people observing the sessions. This includes VA stakeholders, engineering team members, design team members, and any other people who might find this research relevant to their work. Spread observers across sessions. There should be no more than 5 to 6 total attendees (moderator, notetaker(s), observer(s)) per session on the VA side.
