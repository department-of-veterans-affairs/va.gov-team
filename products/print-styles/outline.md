## Overview
Veterans have expressed interest in being able to print both the Review submission and Confirmation screens while completing forms on VA.gov. Many confirmation screens prompt the veteran to print this page for their records, however there is no current print style design implemented on VA.gov. This causes some strange printing errors. 

The goal is to design the print stylesheet to both follow best practices and standardize print stylesheets across all VA.gov pages. 

## Solution Approach

- Utilize print style best practices
- Prints in black and white
- Consistent format of pages across VA.gov 
- All text is left aligned
- Indented for scannability 
- Link styling
- Buttons are displayed as links with link in parenthesis 
- Neither links nor phone numbers are underlined for accessibility 
- Rendered for print accuracy (accessibility and readability)
