# Inclusive research discussion

Recently, the team has been talking about how to make our team's research more inclusive, specifically when it comes to people who use screen readers. Given that screen reader testing needs to happen in actual code and can not happen with clickable prototypes, our team needs to figure out in what scenarious we'd like to conduct testing while someone uses an assistive device and how this might affect how our team prepares for user research.

### Priorities

1. Inclusivity in our research, especially of people who use assistive devices when navigating VA.gov
2. Being able to quickly complete research when we need to
3. Knowing when we should plan to test work in code and when testing in code is not necessary
4. The whole team being on board with any change in how we currently do things

### Conducting testing in code

I am assuming that the only scenario in which we want to test a coded prototype is usability testing. Given that we are already code complete at UAT, I don't think it's relevant to this conversation.

**Question**: Is this assumption correct? Is the only time we'd need a coded prototype during usability testing?

### When we want to conduct usability testing in code

- Discuss with team

### Prod testing vs. CodePen

- Discuss with team when it might make sense to test in prod vs. CodePen

### How will the team need to change how it works to accomodate testing coded prototypes?

- Discuss with team
