# IA/Navigation inspiration

In the event we eventually do a comparative analysis on authenticated IA or navigation patterns, these are some sites that might be worth looking at:

- [Kansas City Missouri](https://www.kcmo.gov/home)
  - "I want to..." nav
- [Github](https://github.com/)
  - Personalized menu
  - Left nav in the profile (via "Your Organizations")
