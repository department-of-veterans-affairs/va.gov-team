# Research Plan for Benefits Recommendations Discovery (July 2018)

## Goals
**1. What product & team are you doing this research for?**

* Dragons/Personalization: Benefits Recommendations MVP

**2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product?** 

* The personalization team is looking to launch a benefit recommendation tool that will take information we know about veterans and let them know what they may be eligible for based on that data. There has been [significant background research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Identity/Personalization/Recommendations/Discovery/Internal%20research%20synthesis.md) done by our team and various partners that confirm the need for this tool. Veterans find VA's benefit system hard to navigate because it can be unclear what benefits are offered and what they are eligible for. 
* [ExploreVA](https://explore.va.gov) is an existing VA tool that was created a few years ago to tackle this problem. The tool uses a questionnaire to generate a customized list of benefits that a veteran may be eligible for. We're looking to take things one step further by using VA data to glean what someone may be eligible for without requiring them to enter anything.

**3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research?** 

At a high level, we would like to understand the following:

* **Benefit discovery** — How do people discover benefits in real life, and how can we improve on this? What are the most effective ways to surface benefits, and when is the best time to surface them?
* **Facilitating user understanding** — Given that we are approaching benefit recommendations in a different way than what currently exists at the VA, what do veterans need in order to understand and trust recommendations?
* **Next steps** — After we tell a person they are eligible for something, what are some of the things they might want to do next?

**4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research?** 

Hypotheses, in no particular order:

* In order to effectively surface benefits, we will need to reach out to veterans beyond Vets.gov (eg. send an email).
* People will, more often than not, want to apply for a benefit some time after we recommend it to them for a number of reasons (eg. they need to gather materials needed for the application).
* People will want to know *why* they may be eligible and *how* we know this.

## Method
**1.	What method of research are you planning?** 
  
Evaluate the problem areas and hypotheses outlined above, I plan to:

* **Interviews** on peoples' past or current experiences (a) deciding they wanted to explore VA benefits, (b) discovering benefits, (c) and determining eligibility. 
* **Testing** of ExploreVa and of some [exploratory benefits recommendations](https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/share/P2GB6ZNYTWE#/screens/284491935) designs Mel created to evaluate effective approaches for benefits recommendations and next steps users may want to take.
* All testing will be moderated and remote.
  
**2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions?** 

* **Interviews** will help us get more detailed information from people on discovering/understanding benefits than we can get from the research reviewed in our [internal review](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Identity/Personalization/Recommendations/Discovery/Internal%20research%20synthesis.md). We can use these insights to better understand how to fit in benefit recommendations at different points throughout a veteran's experience.
* **Testing** will help us evaluate what is/is not working with the ExploreVA and exploratry benefits recommendations approaches. This will give us meaningful insights into how we can create a better experience on Vets.gov or through notifications and other interactions outside of Vets.gov. 

**3.	Where are you planning to do your research?** 

* I plan to conduct research remotely, and I would like to use AdHoc's GoToMeeting account so we can screenshare and record sessions.

**4.	What will you be testing?** 

* ExploreVA, specifically the output of results a veteran gets after going through the questionnaire.
* An exploratory [benefits recommendations dashboard](https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/share/P2GB6ZNYTWE#/screens/284491935) created by Mel.

## Participants and Recruitment
**1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?**

I am looking for at least **five** people who meet the following criteria:

* Veterans who have applied for at least one benefit before (can be any benefit), OR
* Veterans who have no benefits but plan to apply for benefits in the future, OR
* Veterans who have applied for at least one benefit and may also continue to apply for benefits (eg. someone who has healthcare and now plans to go back to school and take advantage of education benefits).
* Preferrably veterans ranging in age. 
* Preferrably veterans of different genders.
* Veterans who use Vets.gov, eBenefits, or MHV (since recommendations will likely have a digital component). They may use one, two, or all three.
* Veterans need to have access to a computer during the research session.

**2.	What is your recruitment strategy?** 

I will need help from Lauren/Paris to determine a recruitment strategy.

## When? 
**1.	Timeline: When are you hoping this research will happen?** 

PI8, Sprint 2. I understand we will not be ready on day one of the sprint since that is less than two weeks away. That's OK just as long as research can happen some time within that sprint.

**2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready?** 

* Conversation guide will be ready next week (June 25 – June 29).
* Otherwise, there are no assets to create for this testing since we will be using ExploreVa to help guide the discussion.

**3.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled?** 

I can make time any time during the work day. Meetings are not a concern and we do not need to schedule around them. Here is my availability considering outside obligations:

* **M**: 8:30 am – 6:30 pm (sessions ending no later than 6:30)
* **T**: 8:30 am – 6:30 pm (sessions ending no later than 6:30)
* **W**: 8:30 am – 5:30 pm (sessions ending no later than 5:30)
* **Th**: 8:30 am – 6:30 pm (sessions ending no later than 6:30)
* **F**: 8:30 am – 5:30 pm (sessions ending no later than 5:30)

If someone really, truly can not work with these times, talk to me. There are certain days where I can be flexible and certain days where I can't be.

**4.	Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with? (Ideally this should not be someone on your team).**

* Proposed pilot date: Any time the week of July 2 – 6.
