### Problem Statement:

Veterans don’t know the full scope of what they can do and access in the VA ecosystem or where they can go to find it, and as a result they miss opportunities for services and benefits that might be useful to them. This can be especially problematic fo benefits that have an expiration date and are time-sensitive to apply for. Veterans will miss out entirely if they don't apply in time.

### Goal of discovery

1. Understand the root cause of the problem statement
   - How do Veterans currently find out about benefits?
   - Find the gaps  — which benefits do Veterans often not know about or not take advantage of, and why?
   - Which benefits and services will benefit the most from targeted recommendations?
   - What are the primary barriers to Veterans applying for benefits?
2. Research existing tools (digital or otherwise) for aiding benefit discovery
   - What can we reuse or build off of?
   - What prior successes or failures can we learn from?
3. Define MVP scope
   - Audiences
      - Type: Veterans, Servicemembers, family members?
      - Account level requirements
   - Which benefits we'll recommend
   - How we'll determine eligibility

### What we know

- What is the problem?
  - Veterans don't know the full (relevant? personal?) scope of what they can do and access in the VA ecosystem or where they can go to find it.
- Why is this a problem?
  - They miss opportunities for services and benefits that might be useful to them.
  - Some benefits have an expiration date and are therefore time-sensitive to apply for. If Veterans don't apply in time they'll miss out entirely.

### To investigate

- Why does this problem happen? What evidence do we have?
- How do Veterans currently find out about benefits?
- What barriers exist to **discovering** benefits?
- What barriers and sensitivities exist to **applying** for benefits?
- Which benefits suffer most from a low discovery-to-need ratio?
- What does the "full scope" of benefits and services include?
- What are good UX models for personalized recommendations?

### How we'll get answers

- Review existing research
  - VA partner research
  - Vets.gov research archive, including baseline research
- Get info on Explore VA
  - Metrics?
  - How has Explore VA improved discovery of benefits for Veterans?
  - Where does Explore VA have room to grow?
- Interview Veterans about how they discover and apply for benefits to uncover methods and pain points
- Perform comparative research on personalized recommendation experiences

### Solution Approach: Recommendations Catalog -> MVP
#### [View Requirements Catalog Here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/files/1890847/Recommendations.Catalog.xlsx)

_Requirements Catalog derived from:_ 
- [LogicForAllBenefits](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/files/1890876/LogicForAllBenefits.docx)

- [BenefitsNavigatorPagesAndQuestions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/files/1890877/BenefitsNavigatorPagesAndQuestions.docx)


### Additional Existing Research

- VA Benefits Navigator: [Start Page](https://explore.va.gov/benefits-navigator), [Results Page](https://explore.va.gov/benefits-navigator-results/Ar6IU0mXknjEm0Fmp)

### Considerations
- this is a high value request from veterans

### Questions
- What does the end state look like?
- What is the most feasible, high value MVP from the catalog above?
