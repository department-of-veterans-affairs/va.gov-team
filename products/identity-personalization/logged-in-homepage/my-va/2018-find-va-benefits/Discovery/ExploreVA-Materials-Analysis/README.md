Analysis of the Benefits Navigator funnels and logic.

Quote from the email they came with:

A few words to describe the 5 attachments Becky just sent out:
 
The first is a series of screen shots of the successive web pages and questions that one gets if one explores a particular pathway through the Explore VA military questionnaire, to illustrate how that questionnaire works, and to show where the questions that I have extracted from this questionnaire originate from. It should help make clearer what I am talking about when I refer to the “Military Questionnaire.” That is the questionnaire that, when one completes answering the final question that pops up, then indicates which LOBs might have benefits for which the veteran might qualify.
 
The second attachment, Explore VA List of Military Questionnaire Questions, is my master document showing how I derived the complete list of questions asked for by every branching web page in the questionnaire. See the Explanation tab to understand the other worksheets.
 
The third attachment is the list of questions from the questionnaire that I sent to Jim Jones a number of weeks ago, which is extracted from the previous worksheet.
 
The fourth attachment is the list of questions that I thought CorpDB might have, and it shows the results from Jack Goldberg’s review of this list.
 
The final attachment is not about the questionnaire, but rather shows what I extracted from the Explore VA web site when one drills down to each LOB, and sees the form or forms that are shown by each LOB. I compiled a complete list of data elements requested on every form that was available via this route. See the Explanation tab to understand the other worksheets.
