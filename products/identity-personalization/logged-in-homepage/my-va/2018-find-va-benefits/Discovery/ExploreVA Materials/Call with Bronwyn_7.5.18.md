## Notes from call with Bronwyn — 7.5.18

* When was the Logic for All Benefits document we have last updated?
  * Probably original benefits document — may be from 2014.
  * Send to Bronwyn for confirmation.
* What is her process for keeping this information up to date?
  * Works with contractors
  * VSO communicator meetings
  * Trying to keep up with new legislation, VHA, VBA, NCA, various communications teams so she has her finger on the pulse of when there may need to be updates to benefits or eligibility.
  * Sounds like she's mostly finding about updates through word of mouth.
  * The basic benefits you apply for disability, healthcare, education, etc. Once you qualify for those, there are programs you would be eligible for within that. It doesn't sound like these are all listed in the spreadsheet we have, but that may not be necessary to surface on VA.gov.
  * Colmery act changed some benefits levels.
* In your time working on ExploreVA, what have you observered is/are:
  * The most popular benefit(s)?
    * Disability, education, and spouses/dependents/survivors
  * The benefit(s) people don't know exists or know the least about?
* Do you think the issue is more that veterans don't know certain benefits exist, don't understand or know how to determine their eligibility, or both equally?
  * A lot of them don't know what VA provides.
  * It sounds like issues around this may be because the VA website currently isn't in plain language and makes these things more confusing than it has to be.

Other things that came up
* ExploreVA leverages other veterans talking about benefits because veterans trust each other.
* Challenges around each benefit:
  * People who receive VA pensions are very, very poor, which means it can be hard to find these people and communicate to them that they're eligible for this benefit. 
  * For healthcare, people feel like they need someone who knows the system. Same with disabiity. Bronwyn often recommends people work with VSOs to do this.
  * For education, Bronwyn told an anecdote that people didn't know Post-9/11 GI bill was better than other education options.
  * For housing and home loans, people just don't understand the process overall, not only eligibility but also what happens from there.
  * For life insurance, it has a short turnaround deadline which means lots of people aren't eligible right away. When people get out of the service, they are worried about bigger things like where they are going to live and how to put food on the table, so life insurance isn't top of mind. This means a lot of people miss out simply because of timelines.
    * For service disabled veterans life insurance, emails about life insurance is about 50%.
    * For all emails, they have a 30 – 40% clickthrough rate.
* ExploreVA has a subscription for benefits updates on VA.gov or ExploreVA. Sometimes will partner with MHV to email respective audiences about each other's projects.
  * Medical Centers would also post stuff for them.
* Everything that goes online to go through VA Concurrence —— how will this affect us?
