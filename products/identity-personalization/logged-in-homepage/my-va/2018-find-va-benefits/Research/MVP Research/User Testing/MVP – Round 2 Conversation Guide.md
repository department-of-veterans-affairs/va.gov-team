# Conversation Guide: Testing MVP Round 2 Updates 

Goal: Test MVP updates at the Pentagon to verify updates are user friendly and have not mmade things confusing.

## Intro (2 minutes)

Today we're going to talk about finding and applying for benefits. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 20 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, I do want to hear your honest opinions.** If you've had a frustrating experience or find something we show you to be confusing, we want to hear about it. Your honest insights help us to figure out how we can improve the veteran experience, and we will not be offended by any opinions you express.
- **In this session, we will be looking at a prototype,** so some things won't be linked up yet like they would be on the full site. 

## Warm-up Questions (2 minutes)

1. Before we start, can you tell me a little bit about yourself? (If stuck, prompt to ask about service experience, where they live, their work).
2. Do you have a Vets.gov account? If so, about how often do you use the website?

## First Task: Find VA Benefits Page. (~8 minutes)

### [Prototype link](https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/share/CGO7PLGF63R#/screens/321171386_01-Home-Desktop)

Ok, we're going to imagine you are signing in to Vets.gov for the first time. You can click Sign In for me.

Since you can sign in to Vets.gov with an existing account, let's pretend you are going to sign in through DS Logon. Go ahead and click Sign in with DS Logon. 

Now you are about to go to your homepage, and you see this modal. 

1. What is this modal trying to communicate to you?
2. What is the Find VA Benefits tool?
3. What do you think will happen if you click "Find VA Benefits Now?"
4. What do you think will happen if you click "No thanks, take me to my homepage."

OK, you can click "Find VA Benefits Now."

### Find VA Benefits Questions

1. Take your time to look through this page, and then tell me â€” what do you think the purpose of this page is?
2. The directions say "Tell us which benefits you're interested in, so we can help you apply. Select one or more of the types of benefits below, and we'll help you get started." What do you think this means? How do you think we'll help you "get started"?
3. Please select healthcare, disability, and education and training.
4. I'd like you to take a scan through the options on this page. Do you feel like the options we've listed here:
  * Cover circumstances that feel personally relevant to you currently? **and/or**
  * Cover circumstances that have been personally relevant/important to you in the past?
  * Is there anything that is important to you that you'd expect to see here but don't?
5. Without clicking anything, what do you think will happen when you click Save Preferences?
6. Without clicking anything, what do you think will happen if you click Cancel?

Before we continue:

1. How can this page be improved?
2. What about this page worked well?

OK, now please click Save Preferences.

## Second Task: Dashboard (~8 minutes)

Alright, now we are on your homepage. 

1. Take a look at the Find VA Benefits section. Is this what you expected to see after clicking Save Preferences?
  * (If no) How does this differ from what you expected to see?
2. Take a look at the Healthcare block:
  * What do you think you will see when you click "what should I do before I apply for healthcare?"
  * Why do you think this content has been collapsed in this FAQ? What are your thoughts on this presentation?
  * Is this content helpful or unhelpful in guiding you on how to apply? Why or why not?
3. Now let's look at disability. Please click "what should I do before I apply for disability?"
  * Is this content helpful or unhelpful in guiding you on how to apply? Why or why not?
4. Now let's look at education and training. Please click "what should I do before I apply for education and training?"
  * Is this content helpful or unhelpful in guiding you on how to apply? Why or why not?
5. Say you wanted to remove one of these blocks from your homepage. How would you do that?
  * What would you expect to happen when you clicked "Remove?"
6. How would you add a new benefit to this section of your homepage?

Before we continue:

1. How can this page be improved?
2. What about this page worked well?

## Third Task: Wrap-up questions (~5 minutes)

Now I want to ask you some questions about the overall experience we just went through today:

1. Do you think this is a helpful or unhelpful approach to help people get started learning about or applying for VA benefits? Why?
2. In what ways can we better surface benefits so they are easier for veterans and service members to find and understand? This could be on this website or offline.
3. In what ways can we better help people through the application process? This could be on this website or offline.
4. Would you recommend or not recommend the experience we just looked at to a fellow veteran to help them apply for or explore a benefit they are interested in?

## Thank-You and Closing - 1 minute

That's all I have for you today. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
