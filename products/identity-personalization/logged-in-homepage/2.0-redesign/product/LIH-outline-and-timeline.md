**** We need to keep the team/engineers in the loop throughout the process in order to get valuable feedback as we go along vs having them just see final designs

# Logged-in homepage outline and timeline

Based on the [V1 plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/product/v1-plan.md) and [Logged-in homepage discovery summary](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/discovery-summary.md) that Liz Lantz put together, we have planned out phases to design and build the new Logged-in homepage. 

The strategy that we outlined below is based on the following direction:

Decide on our high level concept, code the most MVP version of all benefits categories and then iterate up from there on all categories. 

We broke this strategy down into 3 phases.

- Phase 1: Create 2-3 high-level concepts for logged-in homepage
- Phase 2: Design Healthcare and Disability sections
- Phase 3: Design Education and Records sections

## Phase 1: Create 2-3 high-level concepts for logged-in homepage: ~ 1 sprint
