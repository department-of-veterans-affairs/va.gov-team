Research Plan for Authenticated Experience team, Logged-in homepage, April 2020
===============================================================================

Goals
-----

**1. What product & team are you doing this research for?**

Logged-in homepage, Authenticated Experience team

**2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product?**

Prior to the launch of the redesigned VA.gov in November 2018, the logged in homepage on Vets.gov was a personalized dashboard that allowed veterans to view their in-progress applications, claims, messages, and prescriptions. When the new VA.gov launched, this dashboard was renamed My VA and moved to a different location; users' logged in homepage remained the same as the logged out homepage.

As time has gone on, My VA has grown but scaled poorly due to the structure set by the MVP. Additionally, the logged in homepage and My VA compete for veteran attention and focus. 

Through [research we did over the summer](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/personalization%202.0/discovery-research/dashboard-interviews/research-summary.md), we determined that it's time to revisit both My VA and the logged in homepage. [We have proposed consolidating these two pages into one](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/personalization%202.0/discovery-research/README.md#key-takeaway-we-need-to-revisit-our-my-va-logged-in-homepage-approach) by getting rid of My VA altogether and treating the logged-in homepage as a user's personalized landing pad and router.

We'd like to talk with Veterans to better understand their expectations of logged-in experience to inform the next phase of our design work.

**3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research?**

  - Why do participants log in to VA.gov?
    - Currently
    - Expectations for the future
  - What do people think the difference should be between the profile and dashboard/logged-in homepage? 
  - Should there be a meaningful difference? 
  - What content do people expect to see in either section?
  - What types of notifications do people expect to see?
  - Where do people expect to see/receive notifications? 
  - How do we balance
    - notification info (status update/action items), 
    - widgets (showing upcoming appointments, their local VAMC, maybe delivery updates for prescriptions, etc), and 
    - links into tools (eg. top tasks)?

**4. What is your hypothesis for this research?**
   - Veterans will see their profile as a place to see personal information about them that is in their control.
     - Content expectations for the profile would reflect information they provided through a registration process. Personal things like contact information, dependents, branch of service, etc.
   - Veterans will see their logged-in homepage as a "dashboard" where they see personal information that is influenced by the VA
     - Content expectations for the logged-in homepage would be status updates, benefits they currently receive, historical info like past claims, information related to their healthcare provider, etc.
   - There will be some items of content whose ideal location will not be clear cut in our study, e.g. rated disabilities might belong in profile for some folks and the logged in homepage for others.
   - The content Veterans expect to see on their logged-in homepage will mostly be items they can take action on, and they'll expect a way to take a next step.
   - Veterans will expect to see notifications in some kind of notification specific area, probably accessible through the navigation.

Method
------

**1. What method of research are you planning and why?**
  - We'll conduct an initial short qualitative interview to gain insight into the "why" questions we have.
  - This will be followed by a moderated, closed card sort to see how Veterans differentiate content on their profile and dashboard.
  - We'd also like to work with Veterans on a  co-design exercise to better understand their expectations for what a dashboard should look like.  Still to be finalized.
  
**2. Where are you planning to do your research?**

  - Sessions will be remote moderated sessions.
  - We'll use Zoom and Optimal Workshop.
    
**3. What will you be testing?**

  - We will set up a card sort exercise in Optimal Workshop

Participants and Recruitment
----------------------------

**1.Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?**
  - Veterans who log into VA.gov
  - To ensure a diverse group of participants, we request a mix of male and female participants, enlisted and officer (for socio-economic diversity), and geographic assortment.
  - To ensure inclusivity, we request some participants that have identified cognitive impairments and/or functional disabilities. 

**2. What is your recruitment strategy?**
We will leverage Perigan's recruitment capabilities.

When?
-----

**1. Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research?** 
May 11-May 15, 2020

**2. Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready?** 
Card sort + co-design plans will be finalized by May 6

**3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? (This helps with scheduling & thank you gifts.) e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours)**
45-60 minutes

**4. Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled?**

  - May 11 available from 3pm - 8pm
  - May 13 and 15: available from 9-11am and 2-8pm
  - May 12 and 14: available from 7am-9am, 11am-3pm or 6-8pm

**5. Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with?**
May 7, team member TBD
