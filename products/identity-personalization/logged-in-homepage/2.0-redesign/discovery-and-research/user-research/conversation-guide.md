## Intro - 3 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Liz Lantz and I have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Our team is working on re-designing the page you see when you log in to VA.gov so that it's  personalized to your needs. Today, I'd like to talk about your experience when you log in to the site, and then we'll go through an activity that will help us understand what would make a personalized page most useful to you.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45-60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve the logged-in experience to better meet Veteran's needs. I won't be offended by any opinions you express, and I wholeheartedly welcome your feedback.

- **You and I will go through a collaborative activity to help our team understand how we can design a personalized page that best meets your needs.** We'll use a virtual board to create a rough version of a page that would best meet your needs and expectations - I want to emphasize this is not a generic page for all Veterans.  I'll drive the mouse so you focus on our conversation. Again, please note we're not testing you in any way, and there are no right or wrong answers.

  If time allows, I have card sort set up that we can jump over to after the virtual board.

- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**

- **Do you have any questions so far?**

- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

- If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

*Start recording.*

-   I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?

## Warm-up Questions - 10 minutes

Before we start the activities I mentioned, I'd like to ask a few questions about how you use VA.gov and the benefits you receive.

-   Do you remember the last time you visited VA.gov. What were you doing?
-   Do you remember if you logged in?
-   Can you explain whether or not that was a typical experience for you?
-   Tell me about some other times you've gone to the site.
-   How about other times you've logged in? 
-   When you visit the site, how often do you sign in?
-   And last but not least, can you tell me about the benefits you currently receive?

Great! Thanks for sharing all of that with me.  Let's get started. I'm going to share my screen.

## First Task: Create and Review Items - 10 minutes

*Begin screen sharing*

Can you see my screen?  Great! This is a tool called Mural. This is what we'll use to create a rough version of your personalized page.  

You can see here that I've set up some blank sticky notes for us to get started, and I created some outlines to use as pages. One can represent the personalized page you see when you log in to VA.gov; I created the other in case there's another place on va.gov that makes more sense for any of the items.

First, we'll use the stickies to create items to put on the page.  Then, we'll organize them in the way that would be the most useful to you, if it were a real page.  

- To get started, let's create some stickies for the items that are important for you to see when you log in. Again, just a reminder that we're talking about a personalized page that is specific to you, not a generic page for all Veterans.  
  As we create the stickies, we'll talk through why each one is important to you.

- You mentioned the last time you logged into VA.gov was to [state action].  Would stickies. around those actions be a good place to start?

  -   *Create sticky notes with each item.*
  -   ***Can you share details on why that's important to you?***
  -   ***What actions did you take when you looked at that in the past?***
  -   *Help participant make any items that are too broad more specific*

- Why are those things the most helpful for you?

- Okay, I'd like to show you some other stickies I made ahead of time that I thought might spark some interest for you.

- Take a moment to review them, and think out loud as you do - I'd love to know how these resonate with you.  If you spot any duplicates before I do, let me know so we can de-clutter.

  *Allow participant to review cards and encourage them to verbalize their thoughts as they do so.*

- Are there any items missing that would be valuable to you? We can go ahead and add them.

### Things to watch for:

-   How confident is the participant when listing the items they'd want to see?
-   How does participant respond to "why" each item is important?
-   What elaboration did the participant give (if any) on what information they expect to see in a particular item?
-   How did the pre-populated cards resonate with the participant?
-   Which items is the participant most confident they'd be interested in?
-   Do any items cause the participant to hesitate?
-   Any mention of notifications or updates?

## Second Task: Organize Items - 20 minutes

Great! Now, we'll move on to our pages. 

As I said earlier, one can represent the personalized page you see when you log in to VA.gov; I created the other in case there's another place on va.gov that makes more sense for any of the items. We can make more pages later, if we need them.

First, let's organize the stickies on your personalized page in the way that reflects how important they are to you. Tell me where to put each one, and we'll talk about why it would be helpful for you to have it there.  You can use the annotation tool to point if that's easier to guide where things go.  If there are stickies that are important to you, but you don't feel like the page is the right place, we can work with them later.

-   *Organize stickies with participant, encouraging them to continue thinking out loud and asking for clarification.*
-   *Use size to help reflect priority*
-   *If it doesn't happen organically:* Should we group any of these together?  Where would you want to see these groups?
-   *As appropriate, ask*
    -   ***Can you share details on why that's important to you?***
    -   ***What actions did you take when you looked at that in the past?***
    -   If they'd expect to have access to those from anywhere else in the site
    -   If participants have trouble, ask questions based on what they already mentioned was a priority.
-   *Once it feels like they're done:* It feels like we're slowing down and things might be in a pretty good place.  How are you feeling about what we've done here? Do we need to make any adjustments?
-   Now let's revisit the other stickies that aren't on a page yet. 
    -   Why are these still important?
    -   Where would it be most helpful for you to be able to access them?
-   *If it hasn't been discussed:*  Many sites have some kind of way to provide people with notifications and updates when they log in. What, if anything, would you expect to see with regards to notifications or updates for these items or sections?

### Things to watch for:

- Does any part of the organization cause the participant to hesitate or get stuck?

- What sections or groupings does the participant create?

- Does the participant make any distinction between the homepage and another possible section of the site (profile)?

- Where does the participant place notification related items?

- What expectations does the participant have around notifications and updates?

## Backup Task 1 - 20 minutes    
<details>
  <summary>Card Sort</summary>

Thanks for going through that with me! That was really helpful. I'd like to move over to a card sorting activity, which will give us some quantitative data to analyze when we're done with our study..  

In this activity, you're going to see a list of items, and a homepage bucket that you can move items into.  The first step will be for you to put items that you'd want to see on a personalized homepage into the homepage bucket.

Once you've got everything you want in your homepage bucket, we'll see what's left in the list. If you think belong somewhere other than a homepage, you can create and name a new bucket. You can also make one called "not important" for items that are just straight up not useful to you.

-   *If you have not already discussed with participant:*
    -   Before  we jump in, think about what your ideal personalized homepage would be like when you logged in. Remember this is just for you, not a generic page for all Veterans.  
    -   What items come to mind that you'd want to see on your homepage?
    -   ***Can you share details on why that's important to you?***
    -   ***What actions did you take when you looked at that in the past?***
    -   Great, thank you, that's very helpful. 
-   I'm going to send you a link to the card sort now.
    *Send participant the link. If necessary, guide them through Optimal prompts*
-   Go ahead and start adding items to your homepage. I'm really interested in your thought process, and reaction to the list we put together, so please try to think aloud as you move them.

    -   *As needed, encourage participant to think aloud and ask for clarification*

    -   *As appropriate, ask participants to elaborate on possible next steps they'd expect for certain cards, and if they'd expect to have access to those from anywhere else in the site*
-   *Once it feels like they're done:* It feels like we're slowing down and things might be in a pretty good place.  How are you feeling about what we've done here? Do we need to make any adjustments?
-   Alright, now let's look at what's left.  Talk me through where you think these should go. You can make buckets accordingly.
    -   Why are these items still important to you?
    -   *Ask participants to clarify any ambiguity.*
-   Are any cards missing that would be valuable to you?

### Things to watch for:

-   How confident is the participant when listing the items they'd want to see?
-   How does participant respond to "why" each item is important?
-   What elaboration did the participant give (if any) on what information they expect to see in a particular item?
-   How did the pre-populated cards resonate with the participant?
-   Did the participant create any new categories?
-   Which items is the participant most confident they'd be interested in?
-   Do any items cause the participant to hesitate?
-   Any mention of notifications or updates?
</details>
## Backup Task 2 - 10 minutes
<details>
  <summary>Grouping cards</summary>
Alright, now let's take a look at what we've got in these categories.

-   Should we group any of them together?
    *Prompt participant to talk through reasoning behind groupings*
-   Talk me through the priority of these groups for you. Which are most, and least important?
-   Describe how you'd want to see these laid out on the page(s).
    *Use the annotation tool in Zoom if needed to sketch out ideas and confirm understanding of participants feedback*
-   *Once it feels like they're done:* How are you feeling about what we've done here? Do we need to make any adjustments?
-   *If it hasn't been discussed:*  Many sites have some kind of way to provide people with notifications and updates when they log in. What, if anything, would you expect to see with regards to notifications or updates for these items or sections?

### Things to watch for:

-   Does any part of the organization cause the participant to hesitate or get stuck?

-   What sections or groupings does the participant create?

-   Does the participant want to add even more categories?

-   Where does the participant place notification related items?

-   What expectations does the participant have around notifications and updates?
</details>
## Third Task: Discuss current logged-in experience - 5 minutes

The last thing I wanted to review with you is the current logged in homepage.

-   I'd like to learn more about your thoughts on the current logged-in experience.
-   Tell me how what you see lines up with your expectations.
-   Is this what you typically see when you log in?
-   Our session today has been focused a personalized homepage - how do you see that as being different from your profile?

That's helpful, thank you!

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

-   Is there anything you'd want to see on the pages/cards we made today that we haven't talked about?
-   Is there anything you'd want to be able to do from the pages we made that we haven't talked about?
-   *Ask participant what they would call this page. They may have already brought it up in the session (e.g. dashboard, homepage, etc)*
-   Do you have any other thoughts on anything we discussed today you want to be sure to share before we wrap up?
-   Any questions for me?
