**When visited va.gov last time?**

~ 2 mos ago

-primarily use it to keep track of health rcds

-also use it to sched appts --- it's easier than calling hospital

--- logged in last time went to VA.gov

--- it was "normal" - when I log in, takes me to generic page, then you have to "go thru all these diff links to get to where u need to go"

"wd be easier if it had everything lined up on my homepage" so I could get to it"

--- I see "generic page" - when u log on, it's got columns-type-thing and diff links --- and --- I have to go thru another link to download my med rcds >> sx that doesn't work, sx when I log in, it says "can't be found" (the site where download med rcds)

**Other times went to va.gov?**

- when I go, I try to sched appts, so I have to find my VA ctr - sched appt w/my PACM that way >> sx it's easy to get to and do what I need to do, sx site crashes

- major issue is that there are so many vets that it is so hard to keep that website up >> today I can't even log on: "It keeps telling me that the website can't be found."

- VA.gov > log in > myaccess... .mil (missed some of the URL) - "I have to log in with my DS login."

**How often try to sign in?**

- as often as I can, when I need to go. I am one of the few who can actually go on base and get med treatment

- her primary is at Ft. Eustis - she schedules on base as backup if she can't get in to her primary

**Benefits:**

- disab compensation

- healthcare

- approved for housing grant

**Mural exercise...**

**What u want to see as soon as u log in?**

**1) health rcds -**

- click to take me right to med rcds. B/c Ft. Eustis can't always see what the VA is inputting (like diagnoses) >> I can take this info and give it to Ft Eustis so they can put it in my med rcd

- I am above the knee amputee

**2) list of my meds -**

- want list organized, have all meds there

- I have a list, but they're not always what I'm taking

- think updating the list "wd be the VA's side"

**3) sched appts** - (when prompted)

- u r registered to 1 VA hosp - I am in Hampton, VA Med Ctr

- so many vets here it's hard to sched appt >> easier if you go online

- I wd like to have the sched appt button "on my home screen so I don't have to dig thru a list of VA ctrs"

**Would you want to see housing benefit into? **

4) yes, I wd love "to see how much I have left" for **housing benefit**

- same with **disability**

- also want site to "lay out what they are"

- mentioned eBenes as way to get to VA.gov

"lay out what they are" - 

have list of what they diagnosed you with

"some ppl don't have small med rcds"

**Showing pre-made stickies** (tasks)

LL erased duplicates of what the participant mentioned

"I do actually like the secured message with my doctor... Maybe you don't have to go in and wait in line."

"To be able to refill prescripts w/out having to click on other pages wd be great."

**disability ratings**

combined rating and individual ratings  - "that would be awesome, too"

**share your VA med rcds -**

If we were able to do that, it would be amazing.

"If you can't get in to see your PCM (primary care doc) in 30 days, you can see an outside doc... That actually wd help a lot of vets"

**status for med supplies** - 

"awesome, too"

now u can place orders, but u have to jump thru hoops to get it

LL - anything irrelevant, u don't care abt?

Participant explainted that eBenes has: 

- GI bill benes

- claim & appeal status

"If they cd put all of what we do on eBenes on VA.gov, we cd get rid of eBenes and just use VA.gov..."

**dependents -** want to see -

- who classified as my dependent

- if have to take a dep off, want to do it in 1 click

**chg uname and password**

**set up for 2-factor auth**

- 2FA important b/c I feel like I'm protecting my info (mentioned hackers as reason)

**track VA disab claim and appeal status**

- diff than main track claim and status

--- when u initially claim, they break it down into phases (u have to go thru couple phases) --- no, now I don't think that it's really different

- I would put "track ur disab claim or appeal status" over the other one

**your VA medical center**

wd want to see where you're getting your healthcare from

**Organizing the tasks she picked...**

1st 3 participant picked are in bold.

1) **health records** most imp + later added share your VA med rcds

2) **secure msgs** with my doc next to list of your prescripts + order status >> put **sched appts** here

3) **sched appts** + grouped with your VA med ctr

4) chg uname and pwd all the way to the right (upper) >> expect to do that on this page (prompted). So not a separate page to manage? No. 

- added 2FA to this

5) dependents - put under 2FA

6) rate your disab and GI Bill benes go with track your disab claim + housing grant

^ "that all goes together" b/c "it has to do with your rating of your disab and ur benes that come from that" >> housing grant is tied to my rating; "b/c my disab rating is total, there are a lot of other --- I hate to say --- perks that go with it."

Her doctor is not always at her VA med ctr.

I'm wondering if my health rcds should go with the prescriptions?

LL - like a health ctr? Yes

Participant - put VA med ctr there, too

Prioritizing... 

playing with sizing and placement on page

chg uname and pwd in upper right

**Looking at the layout... **

"i think it wd be easy for me to access everything, and I'm able to just click & I'm right where I need to be."

**LL - notifications or updates u wd expect?** Related to prescripts or msgs, how wd u want to see that displayed?

Participant - Can I add to it?

"I wd also like a direct button for my shot rcds."

"u wd be able to keep track of what shots u need every yr and how often u get them --- versus trying to keep track"

- put this with healthcare

**LL - showing current logged-in homepage -**

this was what she was describing in beginning of session

- refill, track prescript, appeal status, claim, VA med rcds, bene letters, request military rcds (missed some of this list; we were looking at healthcare and disab sections of existing homepage)

^ all those things need to be there except military rcds

- I access prescripts, appts, VA med rcds

occasionally I use check your claim or appeal status

**LL - how hp diff from your profile?**

Participant - U mean the hp now? 

LL - how wd what we designed today be related to hp

"I don't really know. I don't see a difference."

**LL - anything else you'd want to be able to see or do that we haven't talked abt?**

Wd be nice to be able to download your shot records, too

u can already download ur med rcds

**LL - what wd u call this page if u saw it in the navigation of the website?**

Participant was quiet for a while, seemed to have trouble answering. 

"It's like a profile."

"They cd change the name to 'Veteran Center.' "

"If we cd customize the hp... I think a lot more vets wd use it."
