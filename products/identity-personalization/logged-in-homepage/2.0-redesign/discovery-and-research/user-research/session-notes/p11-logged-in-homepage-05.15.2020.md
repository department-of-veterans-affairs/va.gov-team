## Intro - 3 minutes

**Moderator:** Thanks for joining us today! My name is Liz Lantz and I have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Our team is working on re-designing the page you see when you log in to VA.gov so that it's  personalized to your needs. Today, I'd like to talk about your experience when you log in to the site, and then we'll go through an activity that will help us understand what would make a personalized page most useful to you.

**Participant:** Okay

**Moderator:** Before we start, a few things I want to mention: This entire session should take about 45-60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve the logged-in experience to better meet Veteran's needs. I won't be offended by any opinions you express, and I wholeheartedly welcome your feedback.
You and I will go through a collaborative activity to help our team understand how we can design a personalized page that best meets your needs and expectations. I want to emphasize this is not a generic page for all Veterans.  It’s just going to be about you. We'll use a virtual board to create a rough version of the page, and I'll drive the mouse so you focus on our conversation. Again, please note we're not testing you in any way, and there are no right or wrong answers.

**Participant:** Fine 

**Moderator:**   If time allows, I have card sort set up that we can jump over to after the virtual board.

**Moderator:**  If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

**Participant:**  Ok 

**Moderator:**  Do you have any questions so far?

**Participant:** No

**Moderator:** Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?  We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. 

**Participant:** Do whatever you need to do

 *Start recording.*

 **Moderator:** I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?

**Participant:** Yes

 **Moderator:** Great thank you 

## Warm-up Questions - 10 minutes

**Moderator:** Before we start the activities I mentioned, I'd like to ask a few questions about how you use VA.gov and the benefits you receive. Do you remember the last time you visited VA.gov. What were you doing?

**Participant:** Prob a month ago. Refilling a prescription


**Moderator:** Do you remember if you logged in?

**Participant:** You have to to fill in a prescription

**Moderator:** Can you explain whether or not that was a typical experience for you?

**Participant:** Yes

**Moderator:** Tell me about some other times you've gone to the site.

**Participant:** Um..gone there so I've used messaging a couple times to go to the nurse rather than the doctor over the last 12 months. I've gone there to check appointments even though they waste a lot of money mailing information so I guess it’s a lot of people that don’t show up. They spend a lot of money on appointment verification. What do you wanna be when you grow up? How about keep track of your time. I didn’t sign up to the VA till I was in my 60s. Despite some of my antics I was blessed with decently good health.

**Moderator:**  That's good that you’re reasonably healthy and don’t have to use the breadth of services

**Participant:**  It's a sad sight to see guys younger than me 75-100 overweight, some are in la la land and some people have legitimate problems. War does things to you mental and physical. 


**Moderator:**  And last but not least, can you tell me about the benefits you currently receive?’

**Participant:** I have healthcare for the rest of my life. I have a $5 copay on any prescription and they send at 3 month intervals

**Moderator:**  Healthcare is the only benefit you’re using?

**Participant:** Yes 

**Moderator:**  Great! Thanks for sharing all of that with me.  Let's get started. I'm going to share my screen.


## First Task: Create and Review Items - 10 minutes

*Begin screen sharing*

**Moderator:** Can you see my screen?  Good. This is a tool called Mural. This is what we'll use to create a rough version of the personalized page you'd want to see when you log into VA.gov.  

**Participant:** Ok

**Moderator:**  For our exercise today, let's imagine anything is possible. As we talk about what's important to you, think about anything and everything VA that would be helpful for you to see or have access to when you log in.  eBenefits, My healthE Vet - anything is fair game.  

**Participant:** Yah

**Moderator:**   You can see here that I've set up some blank sticky notes for us to get started, and I created some outlines to use as pages. One can represent the personalized page you see when you log in to VA.gov; I created the other in case there's another place on va.gov that makes more sense for any of the items.

First, we'll use the stickies to create items to put on the page.  Then, we'll organize them in the way that would be the most useful to you, if it were a real page.  
  
**Moderator:**  What would you want to see when you first log in to VA.gov?

**Participant:** Um...I think they can simplify the opening page. How to simplify it, that’s not my ballpark. It’s not an unfriendly, user experience, from a personal standpoint they put a lot of crap on there that I don’t care about. I don’t know how you personalize it. You got 20,000 veterans how can you do that 

**Moderator:** When you log in, there are things that the VA knows that you’re doing that can eliminate all that crap on the home page. If you want to log in we can be smarter so you don’t have to sort through the crap, and get to stuff you need  . How do you refill a prescription

**Participant:** You log in and you have to go to messaging. Messaging makes it possible to send an email to your physician and then it’s got...im trying to remember it. 

**Moderator:** Let’s think about if you log in and see messaging on the page when you first log in. would that be useful to you

**Participant:** Yes. Prescriptions.. Appointments...Um idk if they do any good but a place for you to complain and it’s responded to. It requires a response 

**Moderator:** Got it 

**Participant:** They need to talk more about their choice program. I think that they. I realize it’s costly but in some cases it’s cheaper. Keeps the system from being totally overloaded. It’s phenomenal the people they process through. They opened a clinic , from seeing a doctor and having blood drawn. More information on the choice program it’d be. Maybe a list of providers in a certain area. Now I’m going through a [PHI]...they need people to be more aware of what’s available in the choice program in the choice that they’re in. Maybe not a choice of providers but information

**Moderator:** You’re getting at 2 things. Raising awareness of choice program, but you who are aware of it. 

**Participant:** This company is trywest. A doctor has to recommend an outside provider, goes through trywest, they contact you and find a provider for you. They do have some providers but I know this is a growing thing. They sent me to a place that’s 5 miles from where I live for this physical therapy. They arrange 16 visits. 

[He went on with a story that had a lot of PHI]

When I cancel the appointment, it says I don’t show up in the system. Fortunately the flu came along, but I got trywest came along. They had tentatively scheduled an appt for June, if it’s not an emergency for people that come in. that’s an extreme amount of time in between. We’re not here to fix the VA but they need to be more efficient. If the patient has a test, if he doesn’t have enough juice in a 30 min window. They can give people, they pedal drugs. They’re like drug pushers. Put everyone in la la land, we’ll get to you when we get to you. I won’t take aspirin for a headache. On your page...that you'll design. I think it’s archaic the system they have right now. I’m not a tech guy, I learned everything i know on computers from trial and error. I think it could be more user friendly. That would be more appealing. Don’t toot your horn on my page. Let me take care of my stuff, and I can get out of there 

**Moderator:** What you just described to get those appointments, it sounds like it could be more efficient. Can you think of ways to make things more efficient? You said you don’t want to cancel your appointment yourself? Is that right?

**Participant:** Sometimes people have physical problems and they can’t make it. I think people want to have the option of cancelling, 

**Moderator:** Cancelling appointments is not important but being able to see them

**Participant:** When and where that’s good. If they cancel it I want to know why. Sometimes they call or generally get their generic letter that this appointment is cancelled whenever 

**Moderator:** Would it be helpful to see that on your page

**Participant:** absolutely 


**Moderator:** Okay, I'd like to show you some other stickies I made ahead of time that I thought might spark some interest for you. It's completely fine if none of these are things you'd care to see when you log in. Just let me know and we can set them aside.

**Participant:** Let me see...I like the first 1 about sharing the records but it would be at my discretion. 

**Moderator:** If there’s anything not useful to you we can put it down here

**Participant:**  Notification preferences is a good one. VA can contact me through the telephone. I initiate the messages and they respond in a reasonable timely fashion. That can improve on their end. 
Documents you’ve uploaded...i didn’t upload any docs, I’m in good health. 

 I can move it down here then…

**Participant:** I have no disability rating but a lot of people do. I don’t have any claims..payment made to you by the VA. They don’t give me 1 dime…Military history is not relative. My military history doesn’t have to be on there. Your order status for medical supplies, I like that that’s good. Your community care location that’s good. Upload claim or appeal...interesting. Your dependents, I have none. Updates on your claim/appeal status. For me no. Well ya know...here’s the problem. I know I'm going to have to appeal to 2 people I know to get them to do the [PHI] . Why would you spend 40-60000 dollars on me? It’s not rocket science, it's economics. That’s a good…
Direct deposit. Never never never. 

**Moderator:**  Why never?

**Participant:** There’s so little privacy left in this world. They don’t need my bank account number. I don’t even do it through online banking. The government already knows so much about us. What’s 2 factor authentication?

**Moderator:** *explains*

**Participant:** I got that. I have a cell phone that stays in the car and you sent me a text message. That was the 5th one I’ve gotten this year. I had a good laugh about that. 

*looks at card sort* Download VA medical records...yes. I know i’m a stickler to my privacy but I know if I’m the only one who can get in my page. 

Letters and docs...what are we talking that here

**Moderator:** What’s your best guess?

**Participant:** Is that all letters pertaining to healthcare, my living will? 

**Moderator:** It could be, I don’t know if VA handles that stuff. If that is would you like it on your page?

**Participant:** That’s fine. When I said I had a living will. They send it to the chaplain. When I went years later, they said I sent one to the chaplain. You received it but you didn’t download it. So I hand carried it to the office.  I carry a card but i think that it’s a good topic. 

GI bill benefits--that’s not a real issue... 

**Moderator:** VA medical center?

**Participant:** Yeah that’s fine. 

**Moderator:** I want to make sure that this page is more useful to you, not fine.

**Participant:** Fine is a word I use too much. It’s fine, it’s good. I’d like to have access to my locations if I go on vacation. Instead of going through google or any other crap. Is there a facility I can go to if I have the emergency 

**Moderator:** You have these community care locations here. We will leave them as 2 separate items  I want to get back to these and all the details..
What would you want to see about prescriptions?

**Participant:** Presently they tell you the name of it, refills remaining, I don’t see any need for any more from that.  [PHI talk] 

**Moderator:**  That’s helpful. Going to zoom out here. Gonna grab all these and put them in 1 group so it’s easier to look at. 

## Second Task: Organize Items - 20 minutes

**Moderator:** Let’s start putting them on the page,   Are messaging, appointments, prescriptions equal importance to you?

**Participant:**  Yes

**Moderator:**  What about these other things?  Medical center, community care, list of choice providers, more places when traveling, we can make these a little group. 

**Participant:** I got 1, that factor authorization. That should go up there with the other 3. 

**Moderator:** Why is that?

**Participant:** As a reminder you’re going to have some other way. I have a password stored but i need something to get on there

**Moderator:** What’s your thought on that?

**Participant:** You’re the expert

**Moderator:** You’re the expert

**Participant:** I don’t know about that but it’s fine

**Moderator:** Where would these fall in your priority--locations and providers? 

**Participant:** What do you mean where on the page?

**Moderator:** Yeah middle priority?

**Participant:**  That’s fine in the middle 

**Moderator:** What are you thinking?

**Participant:** I'm looking to see what we got left over. The next thing that would be interesting. The place to complain is last. The appointment that one there is probably a priority 1 or 2 with me. I don’t like people to assume why I'm interested why you cancel that. People using this flu have an excuse to not do stuff. Appointment is cancelled.

**Moderator:** How would you like that information to come?

**Participant:** Message, they might call, sent it in the mail. Send me a message. Send it to my email. I get rid of email everyday. I don’t get mail like some people do. It’s fast and efficient as far as I'm concerned

**Moderator:** If you received an email and logged in.

**Participant:** Yes absolutely. Medical records would have to be in there. 

**Moderator:** We have share and download

**Participant:**  Share medical records that can be at the very bottom. I’m sure there’s something that i can sign otherwise, but that’s for me. Download medical records that can be in the middle. Change username password that can go at the bottom. The older you get you forget. Either that and you log in that’s not the right password. 

Personal info...I know all of that. 

Your order status for med supplies that can go close to the bottom and personal info close to the bottom

Choice program information- I don’t know where you put it, but I think it’s valuable info if put together right. 

My notification preferences are really email first. Save your postage money.

**Moderator:** You know notification preferences and appointment cancel is that the same to you or 2 different things?

**Participant:**  It could be either way. We're talking about appointments when and where. The notifications go together to me. 

**Moderator:** Tell me when and where and let me tell you how to tell me

**Participant:** I’m sure they’re using interesting conversation for that 

**Moderator:** You verbalized contact info, where to put it?

**Participant:** Put it at the bottom please

**Moderator:** Feels like it relates to personal info and we gotta couple left here

**Participant:** That will go with VA medical records. That’ll be all part of the same. Even though they’re different, uploading claims and appeals should probably go under that.  Updates would go over here (near download medical records, letters, claim appeal)
Let’s call it the diminished capacity section. I like that 
Alright, but let’s be sure to put “in the event…” you’ll still have to figure out how to get into it but it’s there.

**Moderator:**  We got them organized in priority. Would you do any groupings?

**Participant:** What about order status? It’s floating around down here. That probably should be up there ya know I don’t know. 

**Moderator:** How are you feeling about what we've done here? Do we need to make any adjustments?

**Participant:** I like it. 


**Moderator:** Many sites have some kind of way to provide people with notifications and updates when they log in. What, if anything, would you expect to see with regards to notifications or updates for these items or sections?

**Participant:** Not that I can think of. I look at it. I try to be kind to the people that work there because I can’t do what they do. To stay 9-10 hours of that place as an employee would be mentally challenging. They changed their attitude conceribly the last couple years. Half of them acted like they were doing you a favor. Do you fall out of bed this morning or are you like this everyday. You can’t be too complicated but could be cost effective. I didn’t realize this. This VA facility is rated in the middle of the rating system. They’re  not the worst but they’re not the best. The notification thing. Send me an email, send me a message I may or may not check it. The email definitely that’s where I get anything important. The appt cancelled thing. Let me give you an example...I get all my appointments 6 or 7 am in the morning because it’s a zoo. I got there in the parking lot 5 min before my appointment, and I called them. They said you’re gonna be late, well because you’re not on time, we’re gonna show that i didn’t show up or it was cancelled. I went orbital. I talked to the veteran intermediar. You people need to fix your system. Your facilities have inabilities for people to park, you need to fix this. It shows up cancelled. Wait I didn’t cancel it, you did it.

**Moderator:**  I’m surprised you didn’t get a grace period...We have about 10 minutes left





## Third Task: Discuss existing screens - 5 minutes

**Moderator:** Before we wrap up, I want to review a couple of screens with you.

**Moderator:** First, I'd like to learn more about your thoughts on the current logged-in experience. *Show screenshot of current logged-in homepage*


**Participant:** Lab and test results. I’d like to see that when you log in. 
I do check my lab results, before I go. I don’t trust any of them. I got a good personal physician. I feel good and that’s what counts. 

The education thing, I don’t need. I already used the GI bill 45 years ago. I already have an ID card. I don’t need any crap…

**Moderator:** Can you summarize your expectations with this page?

**Participant:** What you’re doing is a great idea. All this education crap. I don’t need that for me. It has nothing to do with healthcare. Nothing. Disability thing. That’d be part of your records. This stuff here is the department of veteran affairs. But having it on my health page does me absolutely no good. 

**Moderator:** Let me show you a screen my colleague made of what it could look like

**Participant:**  Absolutely . It’s cut and dry, it’s there. Everything is important today right this section. I don’t care about education...education benefit claim can we go back on top.

Education...this is san francisco VA medical center. Education and healthcare dont have anything to do with each other. So I don’t know why that’s on there. This is about your healthcare. Education got nothing to do with it. The rest of it is pretty good. It’s presented in a way that catches your eye. I like it. 

**Moderator:**  Something like this would be useful to you?

**Participant:** Don’t tell him that, he’ll get a big head

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

**Moderator:** Do you have any other thoughts on anything we discussed today you want to be sure to share before we wrap up?

**Participant:** No, I think you’re on the right track. I think that something needs to be done to change it. I used to go once a year now and now it’s 6 month because I went to the “old as dirt” category. I appreciate what you’re doing. Hopefully it’ll work out. 

**Moderator:** Thanks to veterans like you, to give us feedback and figure out how to make things most useful. 

**Participant:**  Thanks for your time!
