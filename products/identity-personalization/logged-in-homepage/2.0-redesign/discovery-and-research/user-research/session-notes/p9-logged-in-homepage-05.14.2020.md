## Notes
**Note:** Notes begin after the Moderator began recording the screen/audio.

  - *Start recording.*

**M:** I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?

**P:** Yes 

### Warm-up Questions - 10 minutes

**M:** Before we start the activities I mentioned, I'd like to ask a few questions about how you use VA.gov and the benefits you receive.

**M:** Do you remember the last time you visited VA.gov. What were you doing?

**P:** Actually I do because I went and checked today. 23rd of February.  I was getting medicine refills. 

**M:** Do you remember if you logged in?

**P:** I did.

**M:** Can you explain whether or not that was a typical experience for you?

**P:** Yes. That’s the only thing I usually use it for is to get my refill. 

**M:** Tell me about some other times you've gone to the site.

**P:** I’ve had to go on there to print out a letter that states my benefits that.. actually my percentage. I had to bring it to the DMV so they’d give me my license place. Other than that, I go on to make sure, it’s very random I don’t go on very often, just to see if we’re still getting our disability payment. Other than that I don’t get on there because it’s not user friendly. You have to know where you’re going. 

**M:** Any other aspects that aren’t user friendly?

**P:** I mean, there’s a lot of things on there. It just doesn’t feel placed correctly to me. They’re kind of hard to find, so if you know where certain things are you know what to look for. It’s just overwhelming, a bit. 

**M:** It doesn’t feel placed correctly? What are you referring to?

**P:** Can I pull up the site?

**M:** Yeah! After we go through the session I do want to show you the existing page. So maybe we can swap and talk about it at that point. I want to give you the time to tell me what you would need on the new page. Hopefully we’ll make something super useful!

**M:**  When you visit the site, how often do you sign in?

**P:** Probably, on a good.. maybe once a month. That might be saying a lot. Sometimes I don’t need to see or order anything. 

**M:** And last but not least, can you tell me about the benefits you currently receive?

**P:** Okay! Uhm, so I get disability. I get all my medical through them. Uhm, I think that’s it. I don’t really, oh I have life insurance but I don’t know if I can see that on there. I just got a letter, not gonna lie. 

**M:** Great! Thanks for sharing all of that with me.  Let's get started. I'm going to share my screen.

### First Task: Create and Review Items - 10 minutes

*Begin screen sharing*

**M:** Can you see my screen?  Good. This is a tool called Mural. This is what we'll use to create a rough version of the personalized page you'd want to see when you log into VA.gov.  For our exercise today, let's imagine anything is possible. As we talk about what's important to you, think about anything and everything VA that would be helpful for you to see or have access to when you log in.  eBenefits, My healthE Vet - anything is fair game.  

**M:** You can see here that I've set up some blank sticky notes for us to get started, and I created some outlines to use as pages. One can represent the personalized page you see when you log in to VA.gov; I created the other in case there's another place on va.gov that makes more sense for any of the items.

**M:** First, we'll use the stickies to create items to put on the page.  Then, we'll organize them in the way that would be the most useful to you, if it were a real page.  

**M:**  So, let's create some stickies for the items that are important for you to see when you log in. Again, just a reminder that we're talking about a personalized page that is specific to you, not a generic page for all Veterans.  It'll be helpful if you can also talk about why each item is important to you.
  
**M:** What would you want to see when you first log in to VA.gov?

**P:** The first thing I’d want to see is any upcoming medical appointments. 

**M:** Why is that so important to you?

**P:** I do everything on my phone in my calendar. Sometimes, it’s wrong and I’d rather have a backup. Sometimes, it doesn’t.. when I’m typing it in I may hit on the wrong date. This would be easy for me to see right when it pops up. 

**M:** Is there anything you’d want to be able to do? 

**P:** Uhm, probably like a calendar of my upcoming appointments. I guess you could click into it to go to the appointment calendar, but maybe not the appointment specifically. Maybe just bring me to a page for all of that. 

**M:** What else?

**P:** Definitely prescriptions, because that is the thing I go into here for the most. Let’s see..

**M:** What would you want to be able to do?

**P:** I would like to be able to click and reorder my prescriptions right there so I don’t have to go to five different pages to finally get to it. Right now it’s a drill down process that’s horrible. Let’s see… you know… for me, personally, there’s not really a whole lot else that I do. Like, first time logging in right there. Everything else is secondary to me. 

**M:** You mentioned that you sometimes check disability payments

**P:** Yes! The direct deposit stuff. This one says “VA personal information”. Oh! Maybe it’s my compensation… no that’s not right either. I don’t know what it’s called. 

**M:** Let’s make sure! Check disability payments?

**P:** That’s probably pretty good. That would be good. And another sticky for education so I can see if I have any left on my GI Bill. 

**M:** Okay!

**P:** I don’t know… does our current thing… I see the word “messages” but do we have a messaging system? I know I can message my doctor but… oh! I’ve never seen this before (Participant is clicking around on VA.gov). 

**M:** What kind of messages would be important to you?

**P:** Probably if they can’t pay me or if they have questions on my disability. I mean, yeah. Critical things that would change my entire VA world I guess. 

**M:** Would you expect to receive those critical things in the form of a message? How?

**P:** I would think probably a formal letter in the mail would be what my brain tells me is more correct. 

**M:** As someone who does use VA.gov, what would be useful for you?

**P:** I really don’t know about the messages thing. Maybe via email if they want to contact me. At least in both places. 

**M:** Anything else? You mentioned printing a letter for disability rating

**P:** Yes! They put it under “My VA Letters” and you can choose what you need to print basically. You can select from some things, like benefits summary… proof of minimal essential coverage, I don’t even know what that means! I’m sure it’s important. It’s important to me to have the ability to do the VA letters because sometimes you need them. I had to bring it with me to the military base so I could get on because I’m 100% disabled so I can get into the commissary. 

**M:** Got it! Anything else?

**P:** Uhm.. so, where we put the upcoming medical appointments, I don’t know if on the same one we should link to our health records. I don’t know if it should just say “Health” an open to calendar and records. For me, it should be readily available right there. 

**M:** I’ll put that over for when we start organizing later! 

**P:** Okay!

**M:** Okay, I'd like to show you some other stickies I made ahead of time that I thought might spark some interest for you. It's completely fine if none of these are things you'd care to see when you log in. Just let me know and we can set them aside.

**M:** Take a moment to review them, and think out loud as you do - I'd love to know how these resonate with you.  

**P:** So, absolutely secure messages with doctor. 

**M:**  Why is that important to you?

**P:** Because if I have an upcoming appointment or a prescription has expired, I can message my doctor and within 24 hours she’s responded to me and I can order the prescription or she’s done it for me. That’s a big red button! To me, that’s the easiest thing. I didn’t know it even existed for the longest time. Also, if they call on the phone and you can’t get to their message that’s how you message them back. It’s the easiest way. If you call, it’s an act of God to get them on the phone. But with this, they have to answer within a certain number of hours. 

**P:** Okay, your contact information. That’s important because if you move… I’m not sure how it would be laid out. If you’d have “My info”… I don’t know how that would be. 

**M:** Like, “My info” section?

**P:** Yes! Kind of like.. Health one.. and that one would be “My Info” (moderator is organizing page) 

**M:** We can prioritize them later.

**P:** Okay! I know where my community care locations are. I’m sure that would be important in health section but not first page. Uhm, direct deposit stuff is important but maybe under “My info”. Let’s see… 

**M:** And with this information, what would you expect to be able to do with them if anything?

**P:** For “My info” I’d like to be able to click on the word “My info” and go to a page where there’d be other clickable options. Like, click to change direct deposit in information. It would be on the other page. 

**P:** Share your VA medical records with community care centers or community doctors.. I don’t know what that is. I don’t know I’ve ever used that and I wouldn’t use it. Track disability claim would go under “My info”. Upload claim or appeal under “my info”. All of that is stuff you’d do pertaining strictly to you. THat’s what I would think. Oh god, setting up (2 factor auth) it’s awful! I probably shouldn’t drop that there (parking lot). I should probably put that under “My info” (moderator moves it to that section) 

**P:** Okay, Your notification preferences is kinda the same as the address, phone number, one. THat’s kind of the same. Payments made to you by the VA.. I’d consider that to be the same as direct deposit account information. But if it’s gonna be another button we could put it under “my info” for sure. 

**M:** Would you want it to be a button? 

**P:** I’m wondering if it’s the same as ’track your disability claim’. No, yeah let’s put it there. Change your username of password seems same as contact info. We can also put that under “My info”. And the “Download your VA medical records” needs to go under medical or health. 

**M:** Okay! We’ll bring some from the top back over when we’re done. 

**P:** Yeah. “Your personal information” is same as contact information I would hope. (moderator moves) Your dependents also would need to be under “My info”

**M:** Is that important for you to see?

**P:** I would need to see it eventually if I need to make changes or adjustments. I don’t know if I’d need to see it on this page. I feel like this page would be quite minimal. You would drill down to the next page. 

**M:** So you when you log in, you would expect to see a minimal page that would take you to more options?

**P:** Yes!

**P:** "Download VA letters and documents" would be under “My info”. Oh! "Documents uploaded to VA". I don’t know if I’ve ever uploaded a document. I guess that would be under “My info” if I need to send them something. I imagine I would need to scan and upload something if I went to another doctor I guess. 

**M:** Okay! 

**P:** Let’s see.. "Service history" goes under “My info”. Uhm… now that says “Schedule an appointment” 

**M:** We talked about upcoming medical appointments. This would be for scheduling on the page. 

**P:** Yup, I’d like to see a calendar and have that button on the right-hand side. My bank does a really good job where the checking account stuff and on the right it asks what I want to do. To me, this feels like how that should have been. 

**M:** Like a little dropdown thing? I’ve seen that on a website.

**P:** Yeah! 

**M:** So, you’re saying something like “upcoming medical appointments” and a thing here that says “I want to…” 

**P:** Yup! “Book an appointment” or “Cancel an appointment” even! That sort of stuff would make it easier because some of these pages are just so “dinosaur”. You get to see what we’re working with? Cause it’s awful. 

**M:** I’m interested to talk with you more about that. 

**P:** Okay! 

**M:** We have a few more down here. We talked about “GI Bill benefits” so I’ll get rid of that. 

**P:** You can get rid of “Your VA medical center” because to me that’s not a first page thing. It’s more like a drill in if you need to change your doctor. I’d want to be able to do it, but I don’t need to see it every day. I want to know where to find it to change it. I see a doctor in [two U.S. states] so that would help. 

**P:** Okay, so “Related disabilities combined rating” would be under “My info” but I don’t know if I said that already. 

**M:** I don’t think so

**P:** Order status for medical supplies is important but it goes with the prescription section to me so it’s all together. 

**M:** Okay! I’ll make a group for those and we can organize. 

**P:** Okay! That’s for "Health". 

**M:** "Updates on your appeal or claim status"?

**P:** That would go under “My info” and one button should say “Disability claim or appeal status” and you can drill in from there. You can update it, track it. You’d have quite a few. "Track your disability claim", the one under it.. yup… "Updates on your".. yup (Moderator is moving stickies around while the participant talks)

**M:** How do you see these two being different? (Track vs Update)

**P:** Tracking would be a line item with the system. The updates would be when someone posts, “It left Joe’s office of investigation and it’s in Suzie’s office of… ya know, decision making” Cuz I know they have a certain way of doing it and it’s long, but yeah. Maybe it’s not a who, maybe it’s an office. 

**M:** Would you want to see that information or an action you’d expect to take?

**P:** Being very military, I think there’s no action we can take. It would just be information. I mean, the one right under that says “Upload claim or appeal” would be an action item. That one’s actionable, the rest are not. 

### Second Task: Organize Items - 20 minutes

**M:** Great! Now, we'll move on to our pages. 

**M:** As I said earlier, one can represent the personalized page you see when you log in to VA.gov; I created the other in case there's another place on va.gov that makes more sense for any of the items. We can make more pages later, if we need them.

**M:** First, let's organize the stickies on your personalized page in the way that reflects how important they are to you. Tell me where to put each one, and we'll talk about why it would be helpful for you to have it there.  If there are stickies that are important to you, but you don't feel like the page is the right place, we can work with them later.

**P:** "Education" would go under “My info”. Either that or you could make an “Education one” and have it where you can drill in. 

**M:** I’m interested to know, you have life insurance. Anything that would be useful for you to see here?

**P:** Well, to be perfectly honest I’m not sure that much about it. When I got my rating, I received a letter that said “You can be covered for this amount of insurance” but I don’t know if I’ve seen that online. I don’t know if they exist or I just don’t know where to find it. Okay, “VA letters”.. it’s the same as “documents..” (moderator deletes a couple stickies). Your “Va medical center” could be under “Health” since we’re doing a drill down. 

**M:** You said “Messages” was front and center?

**P:** Yes! Under "Health", you don’t have to drill down. You can just send them a message. 

**M:** Okay, I’m gonna make it bigger and say “this is right on the page. No drilling down”. 

**P:** This one says “messages about payments or questions on disability…” We got that under… I didn’t even know that existed under there. It’s like the Facebook messenger where people can leave a message.

**M:** Do you find that useful?

**P:** No.

**M:** Okay, let’s get rid of that. Okay, so this second page would be “My info page”. Would all of this be on one “My info page?” We have things about personal contact information, some things about documentation.

**P:** For the top one how we have the dropdown. When I see “My info” it’d be “Update my contact information” “Update dependents” “Update username and password”. Those things don’t need to be one big spot. 

**M:** So for medical appointments, you described it with a calendar. What would you associate this group with?

**P:** Basically, for my info it would be that. “I want to” and then select what you want (from the dropdown).

**M:** Would "Direct deposit" be in here too?

**P:** Yes! 

**M:** Okay, cool. 

**P:** Yeah, so that whole first row.. all of that to me would be little dropdown. That would bring you to the next page where you can do all that. 

**M:** Okay! I’ll put this stuff here (moves column to the second page). Would any of these things be part of the dropdown?

**P:** No, I like the dropdown to be things you can control. And the next one would be… okay so under “My info” you could put military service history. If it pertains to the person then I would think that dropdown box would be everything that pertains to me. Things I can change. Uh… I guess we need a whole other box for basically it would be the VA stuff. We could do another one that’s under “My info”. We could do that one for… they have the letters one but I don’t know. Who would go under what?

**M:** The download letters?

**P:** Yeah, I don’t control them. I just go in and make the changes or print the specific ones I need. I don’t know if it needs to be a click that says “Download your VA letters” and it’s a button. Because that button right there would be able to send me to the page that has all the different letters and I could alter the letter there. That would be perfect.

**M:** This button right here? The is a button that say “Download VA letters”

**P:** Mhm! 

**M:** Okay. We’ll put that under here (changes ‘Download your VA letters to sticky’) And that would go to a different page?

**P:** Yeah, there’s 3 or 4, 4 or 5 different letters. All the appeal ones would be with that one. 

**M:** Okay. And these are the things you were talking about being associated with (claim or appeal status button). And that would go to a new page. (Moderator adds an arrow to “track your VA disability claim sticky)

**P:** "2 auth"… sometimes there’s a banner at the bottom of the screen. I don’t know, it needs its own life. Until people get used to it.

**M:** Is the top of the screen where you expect to see important notifications?

**P:** I would, because any time I need to change something that’s where it needs to be announced. So, the payments one I would think would.. I’m trying to look and see… I guess you could put it in “I want to” and it could be its own line that would say “View my payments” or “Disability compensation” is that what it’s called?

**M:** Regardless of what it’s called, what words make the most sense to you? “Disability payment”?

**P:** “Disability payment” is probably what I think it should say. Or benefit.. no.. I wanna know about the payment. 

**M:** Cool! 

**P:** Documents you’ve uploaded… that one.. I kinda feel like it needs to be.. where did we put the.. okay so you see how it has the “Documents and letters”. Oh wait, I don’t know what it’s related to. I don’t know where to put that one.

**M:** You said a doctor’s letter earlier

**P:** Right, but maybe it’s an award. Or something from the past. The only time I’ve uploaded any documents was medical documents to get my compensation. I don’t know what this relates to. If it’s doctor stuff in should be in the health section.

**M:** So when you upload documents you associate it with where you need to upload it

**P:** Right! Or you could have a dropdown for the different types. “Benefits” “Compensation”… there’s another… I’ll tell you later!

**M:** So would it be more useful to have it where it’s out, or have it related to the medical thing? Or both places!

**P:** It would probably have to be in both places on their own page.

**M:** Okay, I’m gonna say “in both places”. 

**P:** Yeah you could name it “Uploads” and “What you’ve done”. “Upload health document” and “Upload military document”. Do you know what I mean? Cuz it would be something like that where it would be separate things. You can get rid of the “View from health”. (Moderator deletes). I don’t know if a drill down box would be the best thing, but that’s what my head says. You wanna put that sticky by it? That one! (Moderator moves sticky) 

**M:** One more thing before we move on! We had put all this stuff up in "Health". Are you still feeling that "Prescriptions" and all this stuff belongs here?

**P:** It would be a link. So when you touch the word “Health” that link would bring me to the next page. On this page, the “Secure message doctor” is good. And "Prescriptions" is big for me. Have a button that would bring me to prescriptions. “Prescription refill” is probably what I would call it. 

**M:** How do you feel about this?

**P:** It’s awesome! 

### Third Task: Discuss existing screens - 5 minutes

**M:** Before we wrap up, I want to review a couple of screens with you.

**M:** First, I'd like to learn more about your thoughts on the current logged-in experience. *Show screenshot of current logged-in homepage*

**P:** Yes it says “Refill and track your prescriptions” I have to click on that, another one after that, and log in. I have to log in multiple times. I mean, it’s okay looking at it. But to me, it’s just… I don’t know. It doesn’t seem like it’s… maybe it’s just too square! I don’t know. For disabilities.. let’s see… check your claim, file for increase,… it’s all very smart. But, what if I have something other than that? Do I click on ‘Disability’ and it goes to everything? Or do I have to find the other parts of that? That to me is a problem. These five little items are great, but that’s not all of them.

**M:** So, it’s not comprehensive. And to you, let’s say you want to do something that wasn’t in there. Where would you go?

**P:** That’s the problem! The page is very hard to navigate. When you look at all the… I don’t know how to share my screen but I can flip my camera. Can I flip it? I’m on an iPad.

**M:** If you can’t, it’s okay. 

**P:** So when I first log in, I can see things on the left hand side that say “My profile”. There’s personal information.. representative, I don’t even know what that is. I’m looking.. it tells me there’s a representative for VA claims and it’s American Legion. I’ve never even gone to the American Legion. I feel like everything in here is too generic. I know for a fact in this town there’s a guy that’s a VA representative. He’s not even listed on there. To me, the data is not the “now”. I’m trying to see where it was for where you asked me on that page. Okay! I log in to eBenefits. And, my screen does not look like what yours looks like.

**M:** Right, this is the VA.gov homepage. That one is eBenefits.

**P:** Right, when I go into VA.gov this is where it takes me.

**M:** To eBenefits?

**P:** Yeah. It brings me here when I go look at my health records.

**M:** And that’s not what you’d expect?

**P:** No! What you’re showing is neat. If I click “Health” it would show everything with “Health”. I like how you can click on it. I like buttons. It’s my thing. I don’t know, this page (eBenefits) is so blah. Okay (showing screen with iPad) so if I go over here on the left it tells us.. and over here it tells us “Popular items” and that’s where the letter generator is. It’s okay, it just feels old. 

**M:** Can you describe why it feels old to you?

**P:** I don’t know if it’s just because it’s a line. I don’t know… the viewing of just the squares. I don’t know. It’s not appealing. The first section says “Confirm your address” and you can select what letter to print. Once you selection, you can print it. And that’s fine and dandy, but I don’t know if this setup is the nicest. 

**M:** Well, let me show you something. This is another alternative that someone came up with for when you log into VA.gov. What do you think?

**P:** I like it! It’s way better than where we are right now. I like buttons because you’re right here, and you can take an action right now. When I have to drill down, I have to log in 2 or 3 times on a lucky day to refill prescriptions. And it brings me to a different system, a different page. This is lovely!

**M:** Let’s say this says “You’re due for a refill” what would you expect the button?

**P:** “Refill your order”

**M:** And what would happen when you click?

**P:** It would automatically refill my order.

**M:** And you would stay on this page?”

**P:** Yup! Stop it, I want this one. It’s much nicer. It’s much more clean. It’s not as crowded because right now there’s a lot of words but not a lot of action. The drill down is painful. Do mine like this.

**M:** Is there anything here you would cut out?

**P:** No, but at the top I like how it says “your va facility” and when you click on it you could change your facility or view other facilities. I was trying to figure out in my head where you would put that. And on the left I like how it has “health, benefits, applications” Someone got in my head cuz it’s perfect! And they have an inbox! I bet that’s what that messages was about.

**M:** Do you think the inbox is different from healthcare messages team?

**P:** I think they could be linked. If I have an inbox that populates and I see 1-10, if that sucker lights up red then I know I have a new message. That’s a smart place to have it. It’s at the beginning, it’s at the top. But yeah, both in inbox. Message from doctor and messages from VA. I don’t know if it’s doable because when I go to health it only shows me my doctors that I can coordinate with. I’ve never been able to choose anything else. 

**M:** That's helpful, thank you!

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

**M:** Any questions for me?

**P:** I like this! I can’t even right now! That would look so much better if we have that. I don’t have any questions. 

**M:** One last question, what we made today is your personalized page. How do you see this being different from a profile? Is it different?

**P:** It is different. I know in the past, not necessarily VA-related - I’ve had a page and I’ve gotten to choose what I want to see on the first page

**M:** So you could customize it?

**P:** Yes, so to me on that blue page you had, if someone could select what they wanted that would be cool. Literally, if that was my choice it would be on my page. Anything else would not be there. If it was totally customizable that would be the easiest and coolest way. 

## Thank-You and Closing - 1 minute

**M:** Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans. Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
