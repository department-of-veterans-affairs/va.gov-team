## Intro - 3 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Liz Lantz and I have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Our team is working on re-designing the page you see when you log in to VA.gov so that it's  personalized to your needs. Today, I'd like to talk about your experience when you log in to the site, and then we'll go through an activity that will help us understand what would make a personalized page most useful to you.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45-60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve the logged-in experience to better meet Veteran's needs. I won't be offended by any opinions you express, and I wholeheartedly welcome your feedback.

- **You and I will go through a collaborative activity to help our team understand how we can design a personalized page that best meets your needs.** We'll use a virtual board to create a rough version of a page that would best meet your needs and expectations - I want to emphasize this is not a generic page for all Veterans.  I'll drive the mouse so you focus on our conversation. Again, please note we're not testing you in any way, and there are no right or wrong answers.

  If time allows, I have card sort set up that we can jump over to after the virtual board.

- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**

- **Do you have any questions so far?**

  - Veteran: No

- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

  - Veteran: Yes, that's totally fine.

- If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

*Start recording.*

-   I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?
    -   Veteran: Yes I am.

## Warm-up Questions - 10 minutes

Before we start the activities I mentioned, I'd like to ask a few questions about how you use VA.gov and the benefits you receive.

-   Do you remember the last time you visited VA.gov. What were you doing?
    -   Veteran: Yesterday. I was getting my benefit letters, printed out, or should I say downloaded, for applying for jobs at the VA.
-   Do you remember if you logged in?
    -   Veteran: Yes, I logged in.
-   Can you explain whether or not that was a typical experience for you?
    -   Veteran: It was probably typical. It takes a little while to maneuver around there but I was able to log in alright.
-   Can you elaborate?
    -   Veteran: [_? May have missed the first part of this sentence_] The first letters that come up are letters about how much your disability is and how much your compensation is and I didn't want that given out. I had to mess around with it a bit and go oh okay last time, and click on more letters and it gives you more options.
-   I'm not super familiar with that process but I think I understand what you're saying. You had to manipulate it?
    -   Veteran: Yes, last time they had  a whole listing of the letters and you could upload, download or print. This time you had to click and I was like, where are these?
-   Tell me about some other times you've gone to the site.
    -   Veteran: I've gone in there to check on the status of my comp and pen claim. I've also gone in there to... it was years ago but for my GI Bill stuff. 
-   When you visit the site, how often do you sign in?
    -   Veteran: Every time. Well maybe 90% of the time.
-   And last but not least, can you tell me about the benefits you currently receive?
    -   Veteran: As in my service connection? I'm 80% service connected, so I basically get all the benefits.
    -   Veteran: I get monthly comp around [redacted dollar amount]. At the VA hospitals, I have no copay, travel pay for any appointment whether service connected or not, voc rehab benefits... yeah.

Great! Thanks for sharing all of that with me.  Let's get started. I'm going to share my screen.

## First Task: Create and Review Items - 10 minutes

*Begin screen sharing*

Can you see my screen? 

Veteran: Yes! 

Great! This is a tool called Mural. This is what we'll use to create a rough version of your personalized page. Let's imagine that anything is possible.

You can see here that I've set up some blank sticky notes for us to get started, and I created some outlines to use as pages. One can represent the personalized page you see when you log in to VA.gov; I created the other in case there's another place on va.gov that makes more sense for any of the items.

First, we'll use the stickies to create items to put on the page.  Then, we'll organize them in the way that would be the most useful to you, if it were a real page.  

- To get started, let's create some stickies for the items that are important for you to see when you log in. Again, just a reminder that we're talking about a personalized page that is specific to you, not a generic page for all Veterans. 

- As we create the stickies, we'll talk through why each one is important to you.

- You mentioned the last time you logged into VA.gov was to go to MHV.  Would stickies around those actions be a good place to start?

  - Veteran: MHV would be good or VA compensation benefits.
- Why? 
  - Veteran: Sometime depending on what people are asking, its not something that will be through the benefits side, sometimes might want to put in a question for the primary care doctor or get paperwork filled out.
- Messaging?
  - Veteran: Yes, like secure messaging.
- What else on MHV?
  - Veteran: Well for MHV, I'm just thinking secure messaging because depending on what they need, people might want to reach out to their PCP. If it's medication or paperwork, that might be done by their VA PCP. That's usually the big thing people are looking for, trying to figure out if they are new to VA, how do you get this?
- For you, someone who is established and logs in, what is important to you?
  - Veteran: I know MHV, but for me - it would be nice to defnitely have secure messaging because I use that a lot. Also comp benefits, especially the state-specific ones. I don't know if that's something to have on there, So, like the state of Wisconsin, you get different benefits if you are from a state that has certain benefits.
  - Veteran: Or like Voc Rehab information. I'm lucky and had to deal with the VA for years but for some other people they're not going to get any of this. Some of this stuff is really hard to find.
- We'll keep this focused just on you, all about you! For the state specific comp ben, what would you want to see?
  - Veteran: It would be nice if it was right on the page, if you have claims pending, it would be great to have a status of them, especially with the covid headache it has been interesting to know what is going on. And even if there's a quick thing for status of claims I currently have. Or, I mean, status of disabilities I've already been approved for.
- Can you elaborate on Voc Rehab?
  - Veteran: Stuff you have to do to go through it. Because Voc Rehab stuff - in some cases you have to have applied for GI Bill. Other cases, you can do work compenstaion therapy and that would be nice to know about. 
  - Veteran: If I knew what I had to fill out - in some cases, you don't have to go to college but they can place you somewhere. I've had a lot of surgeries and am not as mobile and they look into it. That is specific to voc rehab.
- Can you elaborate on MHV paperwork?
    - Veteran: When I was going to have a surgery, like I did in [recently], I had to go through my PCP to get disabled parking but also through VBA to get my 100% temporary rating at the time, it was a lot of back and forth stuff. If some of those links were available that would've been even awesomer. Just to those documents that will end up coming up.
  - Veteran: Kind of like a - here is everything you need in one place so you don't have to hunt around. 
- What else?
    - Veteran: I don't know.
- You mentioned benefit letters:
    - Veteran: Yes those are ones that are automatically created. Standard form 15 used for civil service preference.
- Is that something you would want to see when you log in?
    - Veteran: Yes that would be awesome.

- Okay, I'd like to show you some other stickies I made ahead of time that I thought might spark some interest for you.
    - Veteran: I like the community care locations. Because literally it is - compared to a small bill and a huge bill. If you are traveling and can log in on your phone and find out where you can go.
    - Veteran: I like the Direct Deposit and bank account information. Personally I like to separate my money so my husband doesn't find it. [laughs]

- What about direct deposit and banking info would you expect to see or do?
  - Veteran: To change it or split it up if I needed to.
  - Veteran: I honestly don't care about sharing my medical records. I do care about tracking disability claim and status.

- Do you see the track disability claim/status as different?
  - Veteran: No, it's just worded better.

- To be clear, what would you expect to be able to do?
  - Veteran: To be able to see where your claim is at, where it is in the course of them reviewing it. If it was approved or denied, the reasoning for it.

- Is that all info you'd expect to see right on the page?
  - Veteran: Yes.
  - Veteran: And then... Military service history, I don't care about. I already know what I did. Download letters and documents, I already told you about that one.

- You didn't care about sharing medical records, but what about downloading?
  - Veteran: Yes I would like to do that, I keep a full medical record. Because when you leave the military you learn real quickly if you don't have it it doen't exist. So you want to keep it no matter what in case there are errors or something happens, you cover yourself. 
  - Veteran: Schedule an appointment with VA I guess that would be kind of cool.

- What does that mean to you?
  - Veteran: Usually if you need to do mental health or primary care. I've done that before. It usually has to be 3 days out. So that's kind of cool. Umm. My VA Medical center. I don't care about that because I know where I go.
  - Veteran: I do like updates to Claims and Appeals status but that kind of goes into the previously stated one.
  - Veteran: Dependents, yeah that is nice because there is like a 2 year wait right now. If you have to add any dependents after a service connection, it is like 2 years to get them added. So that whole time you aren't getting paid for them and then you get a back pay.
  - Veteran: It would be nice to see what is listed on there and when they are coming off. If they are going to school right away when they come of age you lost them off your disability. My son is 17 and going to [college soon], do I have him, not have him? What is going on with this kid?
  - Veteran: My personal information, I don't care bcause I know it. If my letter is coming in my name and has my address then I don't care because it's right. You get killed by duplication of that.

- You mentioned address - if you moved or something and your address on letters whas wrong - ?
  - Veteran: Right now there isn't a national system that is updating from VBA to VBHA. The letters I'm getting are from hospitals and those will be correct. But I'm also getting my money from direct deposit so I don't care.
  - Veteran: Your rated disabilities, that would be great - it's nice to know what they have listed for you. Especially if you have something coming up. Like, "Oh, I'm service connected for my left knee but my right knee is coming up, did I apply for that one?" I know this is supposed to be about me but a lot of people I know are like, "I'm service connected to this but I didn't get that." So it's like, "Oh, what is really happening?"

- Can you elaborate?
  - Veteran: You can file secondary service connection that is basically like - I've had [PHI] surgeries now. My [PHI - injury] is [PHI - getting worse now] and if I have surgery on it, I will file a secondary service connection and say that I've had all these surgeries and even though my [PHI - injury] isn't due to military service it is because of the surgeries. If I was only at 10%, if I was at 80% I would be very fortunate. I am 0% connected for my [PHI injury] however I get them all the time. If they get worse, I will file for those and say hey I am still getting these. 0% is saying like, "Yes you have this issue but we are not saying it is affecting you."

- That is a lot to keep track of!
  - Veteran: I started helping people file claims so that's why I have this all in my head.

- Are there any items missing that would be valuable to you? We can go ahead and add them.
  - Veteran: The only other thing is maybe the uploading claim or appeals supporting documents.

## Second Task: Organize Items - 20 minutes

Great! Now, we'll move on to our pages. 

As I said earlier, one can represent the personalized page you see when you log in to VA.gov; I created the other in case there's another place on va.gov that makes more sense for any of the items. We can make more pages later, if we need them.

First, let's organize the stickies on your personalized page in the way that reflects how important they are to you. Tell me where to put each one, and we'll talk about why it would be helpful for you to have it there.  You can use the annotation tool to point if that's easier to guide where things go.  If there are stickies that are important to you, but you don't feel like the page is the right place, we can work with them later.

Top priority?
- Veteran: Disabilities I'm approved for, I would say.
- Veteran: Yeah. Also... then I would say Direct Deposit information. And then... Tracking of your VA Claims. Then Comp Benefits. Then... I guess the comp and pen status pending claims.

Are these 2 different to you?

- Veteran: Not really...
- Veteran: Then it would be probably download medical records.
- Veteran: Then Download Benefits Letter.

Are these all still top thing? All one row?

- Veteran: Sure.
- Veteran: Then... let's see here.I guess that rated disabilitis one but that falls in a way into the other ones - that "What your disability status is" and stuff. 

Okay I'll group them for now so we know they belong together.
- Veteran: Then probably... Community care locations. I would want that by MHV and secure messaging and medications in case something happened.
- Veteran: Then.... let's see here. Yeah the MHV links to paperwork. That would be kind of in between being able to contact the claims status letters and your MHV trying to get a hold of your people. Oh and then the dependent should go with the first group.
- Veteran: Then... Upload claims or appeals should go with the first group. Track your Disability claims.
- Veteran: Then another deal would be schedule your VA appointments. Further down the page, a separate area. Right around wherever that is could be Voc Rehab.

Anything else you feel would go with disability claim ratings?

- Veteran: No.

Any other groupings we should be making?

- Veteran: I think MHV ones should be grouped together. If anything you could have a link that could pop them out and put you into MHV and all that good jazz. That might be a very useful hyperlink. 

What if MHV didn't exist and you could just have it all in one place?

- Veteran: That would be aweosme. On MHV they have all this stuff that's like Join this community, join that and for me it's totally useless.

This row up at the top -- there is a lot happening here. Do you have any thoughts about organization ro

- Veteran: Organization-wise, I would want dependents, disabilities approved for, and direct deposit information. The others could just link off. Those are the most important to me. 9/10 times it's one of those 3 things. 

You mentioned a hyperlink - can you elaborate?

- Veteran: When you click Disabilities you're approved for, once you click on there, there could be a link there that goes to track your disabilities and it breaks down your ratings and has claims and appeals information.

We have upload claim or appeal. Would that go with this one?
- Veteran: Yes.
- Veteran: Community care - that is a huge issue. If you go to the wrong place, you might not know if the VA will pay for it.

You are confident about where you go - elaborate?
- Veteran: I know there is nowhere near me approved by VA for urgent care. If I was traveling or out of state or an area I'm not used to and I'm not feeling well I can go look it up right there and find it, vs. trying to have a web page.

What else? 
- Veteran: Benefits letters would be its own thing.

High priority? 
- Veteran: Yes, priority because it has that civil service preference. If you are trying to pull out a loan if you are service connected - I brought my disability benefits letter to the bank to say hey I make money.

 If it's a disability benefit letter, would it fit under this area of disabilities you're approved for?

- Veteran: No it's totally different. If you could just click in there and see all letters you've ever gotten that would be so nice.

Is there anything else you feel is missing or would want to add?

- Veteran: Search bar! I would want to search for anything. If I want to find out about policy - what is this policy for whatever reason or what are the rules fo ran appeal. 

Where would you expect to see that?
- Veteran: Upper right hand side where they usually are.

A lot of sites have a way to provide people with notifications and updates when they log in.
- Veteran: General updates? Or something you can sign up for to receive updates.

For example, logging into an insurance site and seeing that a payment is due. 
- Veteran: Could there be a little bell with an alert or a number on it?

Yes would you expect to see that?
- Veteran: Yes that would be nice. It would be nice to see if I've put stuff in for my comp and pen it would be nice to see oh you have 3 days until this closed. Or like, Hey idiot you haven't logged in in a long time, here are a bunch of changes we've made. [laughter]

Where would you expect to see that?
- Veteran: Upper left hand side since the search is in the upper right.

How do you feel about what we've created?
- Veteran: I'm digging it.

Log in - is this what you see?
- Veteran: Yes

How does this match your expectations?
- Veteran: It's nice and separates everything but there is one thing - yesterday when I was looking for my letters but I was like, "Ok... where do I click on for my letters?" I get that some of this is pretty basic. For my generation this doesn't have what I'm really looking for. If I was 65, I would want my test results and lab results and medication results. I'm 37, and don't need all that.

It doesn't have what I'm looking for, elaborate?

- Veteran: I have to open them up. I have to look to see what it has. I went to Disability and then Records. When I first clicked on it, it didn't show anything. If you click on Disability letters, it makes it seem like you'll only get the amount you're getting paid not the SF-15 which is what i was looking for. It would be nicer if it had stuff that was for people that aren't necessarily elderly.

I know we just spent time making a page that shows the thing you would be looing for. Any other specifics about this and how it could better show you that vs what elderly people need?

- Veteran: Even under education - yeah get your GI Bill but it doesn't talk about Voc Rehab. That is what a lot of people i know are using. They are using GI Bill too. I enver touched my GI bill and saved it for my kids. Seriously why wouldn't I go to Voc Rehab again? I'm saving mine for my kid, and a lot of people I know do that too. They aren't going to touch that because they are like, "Am I going to suffer or is my kid?" If Voc Rehab is a benefit why isn't an easily seen benefit?

Any other thoughts or comments?

- Veteran: No that's basically it.

Our session has been focused on the page you see when you logged in. Different than profile?

- Veteran: I don't think I've ever set up my profile. Maybe I did once. Before this. If we could set up our pages how we want to - these are the top 6 things that matter to me and have them at the top of the page, that would be awesome. I guess it would be your own personalized profile. I don't know, honestly don't know.

Anything that you would want to see on the page?

- Veteran: No, we're good. 

Any actions?

- Veteran: Would like to be able to search easier. Probably a wet dream but if you could search for specific things wihtout getting a whole flood of everything for the VA. It searches the entire VA, VHA, VBA, cemeteries. If you are looking specifically for one thing, a form or something and it comes up with odd ridiculous options and it's like. I'm just being office. I'll call the VSO and wait a day just for them to send me the form.

Overall search - you click on this, enter a term and it pulls up -?

- Veteran: Pulls everything VA wide. 

Would you like to select a specific area to conduct your search?

- Veteran: Yes being able to narrow it down.
- Veteran: If you want to see a joke, just type something in there and you'll be like what? It'll have old publications, new publications. It's really kind of funny if youre in the mood for it.

### Thank-You and Closing - 1 minute

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans. Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
