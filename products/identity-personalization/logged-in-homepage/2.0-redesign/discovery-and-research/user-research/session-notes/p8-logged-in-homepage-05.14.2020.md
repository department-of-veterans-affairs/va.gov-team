notes for p8 completed in Mural by notetaker.

Notes taken from recording:
visited 3 days ago, checkin gon a claim, refilled a few presriotions. I did log in.

typical experience? yes, I use it a lot actually.

other times? I visit once a week, ebtween messaging with my doctor and checking on claims, I'm probably in there at least once a week.

**On Notifications**
it'd be nice if claim status would send you something if it moved.  secrure messaging, it sends me an email when I have a secure message, so I know to log in and check it. That's what prompts me to log in. 

appointments, it sends me a text and an email, usually, I'll get a text a week-ish a week before and an email about 3 days before at some point.  

It'd be nice if there was something say for the pharmacy - again the reason I go to the pharmacy all the is to make sure I have things there and it shows up, it'd be nice if it says you have a refill available but you need to check the box to be sent.

where on the page? a great big bulls-eye right in the middle! a pop-up [laughter]: take care of this before you get lost and forget what you came here for.

Those would be the only things I"d need a notification for.

**Reaction to current logged-in page:**
ehhh...it's not bad. I think my biggest problem - you're at vets.gov, right? The problem is when you do go to health, it takes you to of course, mHv and you're basically leaving one website and going to another. And sometimes it takes time to load up, that's part of life I guess.  I guess I'm used to it, so it's very handy. It works.  

Other than you're going to basically another website, they're just hyperlinks.  So you're really just clicking.

**going back to mural, would these items on your page, still be hyperlinks within the same website?**
If the government could get their act together and everyone could communicate, that would be awesome. 

Basically, all the information in one place would be awesome - because, it always seems like there's gaps between things when you don't have communication between those departments.  Say between claim status and medical history. It'd be nice if you have a claim going on to say, well, right here in medical history -  and send it over to claim status. That's not going to happen because there's hippa laws.

**Reaction to blue sky prototype:**
It's okay. I'm not crazy about it.  Who wants to see bills? Bills go at the bottom. To me, appointments and prescriptions should be at the top.
