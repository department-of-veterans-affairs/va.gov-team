This topline summary is a result of the synthesis that happens after conducting/observing research sessions. This is a high level summary of trends and analysis, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.

The goal of this document is:

-   To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings

-   To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data

Research Questions & Answers
----------------------------

**Why do participants log in to VA.gov?**

-   People are logging into a VA.gov property to complete tasks related to the benefits they're receiving. Many log in directly at MHV or eBenefits.

-   The majority of the users we spoke to had health benefits and log in for healthcare related tasks such as messaging, managing appointments, and ordering medications (things they can do on MHV).

-   Those with disability benefits are logging in to complete tasks related to claims, confirm accuracy of payments, and occasionally, to download benefit letters and other documents.

**What do people think the difference should be between the profile and dashboard/logged-in homepage? Should there be a meaningful difference?**

-   Participant's typically didn't verbalize strong feelings about differentiating between a profile and dashboard, and many even said they didn't know or "there isn't one" when asked about the difference at the end of the session.

-   When going through the exercise, they clearly separated what we define as profile information from the rest of the content. This suggests that they are familiar with this way of organizing content and there should be a meaningful difference, even if they don't outwardly use the term "profile".

-   A few participants weren't interested in including profile information on the page during the exercise, stating that they knew the VA had that information already so they had no need to review or access it.

**What content do people expect to see in either section?**

-   Participants wanted to see current information related to their benefits on their personalized page. Healthcare and disability benefit items were prioritized by participants. Secure messaging, appointments, prescriptions and accessing documents or letters were brought up in multiple sessions.

-   Personal information about the Veteran, and items like change username/password and direct deposit information were commonly grouped together, and separate from benefit information. "A profile I would assume is simply a list of information where a dashboard is relevant and current information"

-   Participants were mixed as to whether or not Your Dependents belonged w/ the benefit information or with the personal info.

-   Multiple participants expressed wanting to see additional information that would help them utilize benefits available to them and take better care of themselves on their personalized page: adjacent benefit information (e.g. disability compensation recipient wants to learn about Voc Rehab), self-care/wellness, community information, etc.

**What types of notifications do people expect to see? Where do they expect to see/receive notifications?**

-   Participants talked about wanting to see notifications about:

    -   Appointments

    -   Prescription refills

    -   Claim status

    -   Approaching deadlines (e.g. 3 days left to provide document)

    -   Money (that they owe, or are owed)

    -   Changes to VA benefits or policies that impact them

-   Many participants expect to receive notifications via email and didn't seem to have the expectation that they would also see them when logged in.

-   When creating their page, participants put notifications on the top of the page, usually in the upper right corner.

-   Participants easily understood, and reacted positively to the in-line notifications associated with each section on the blue-sky prototype. "The way you had it laid out on the demo page was perfect."

**How do we balance notification info (status update/action items),widgets (showing upcoming appointments, their local VAMC, maybe delivery updates for prescriptions, etc), and links into tools (eg. top tasks)?**

-   The best balance is one that will give the Veteran the most current info on the item in question, a way to take action on it (right on the page when it makes sense), and any important relevant notifications in one place.

-   Most participants would find it more useful to have notification in-line with the item in question rather than a separate notification center, but they do know to look at the top of the page for important information. One participant specifically asked for a bell with an number on it. This would be useful as well has having the notification in-context.

-   Participants talked about the current experience as being overwhelming or following a lot of links to get to where they're going, but when designing their own page, did not mind direct links from their logged-in homepage to the task.

-   Information about their local VAMC was lower priority for most participants.

-   When prompted to think about what the first thing they'd want to see upon logging in, one participant responded, "A personalized guide of what I'm trying to look for and where I'm going." We need to make that guide.

Hypotheses & Answers
--------------------

**Veterans will see their logged-in homepage as a "dashboard" where they see personal information that is influenced by the VA. Content expectations for the logged-in homepage would be status updates, benefits they currently receive, historical info like past claims, information related to their healthcare provider, etc.**

-   Participants did see their logged-in homepage as a "dashboard" - a couple even used that word explicitly.

-   Content participants wanted to see didn't totally line up with the hypothesis. All participants wanted information related to the benefits they receive, status updates, and access to VA documents and records. There was less interest in historical information and general info about healthcare providers or their VAMC.

**Veterans will see their profile as a place to see personal information about them that is in their control. Content expectations for the profile would reflect information they provided through a registration process. Personal things like contact information, dependents, branch of service, etc.**

-   Mostly true. There was a clear distinction of personal/profile information when participants grouped items in the exercise.

-   A couple participants associated dependent information with benefit information

-   A couple participants associated rated disabilities with benefit information, or as a separate item on their dashboard

**There will be some content items whose ideal location will not be clear cut in our study, e.g. rated disabilities might belong in profile for some folks and the logged-in homepage for others.**

True. (See above)

**The content Veterans expect to see on their logged-in homepage will mostly be items they can take action on, and they'll expect a way to take a next step.**

True. Veterans wanted to items related to the tasks they came to the site to complete on their logged-in homepage. At a minimum, they expect a link to allow them to complete the task. Even better would be to provide them a way to complete the task directly on the page.

**Veterans will expect to see notifications in some kind of notification specific area, probably accessible through the navigation.**

-   This was mixed - many described email as they way they expected to receive notifications. It seemed that participants are used to the way things are and it may surprise them - pleasantly - to have personalized notifications directly on their homepage.

-   Participants who offered specific feedback/direction on where to place notifications on their page commonly put them in the upper right corner of the screen

Other Findings
--------------

**A design like the blue sky prototype would be useful to Veterans.**

The blue sky prototype was well received by the majority of participants who saw it. The "snapshots" of each section were helpful and contained useful information.  The participants quickly understood the notifications, content, and felt it would be easy to use.

>  "I like the overview because you can see everything without going into the details."

> "Somebody got in my head, this is perfect."

**People are interested in customization**

A few participants mentioned that having the ability to customize would be useful to them. One in particular who felt the blue sky prototype was too overwhelming said it would be useful if she could hide the things she didn't want to see.

> "If it was totally customizable that would be the easiest and coolest way."
