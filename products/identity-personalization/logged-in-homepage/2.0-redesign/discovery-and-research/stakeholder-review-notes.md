# Review of stakeholders for logged in homepage research interviews

**March 27, 2020**

*Attendees: Liz Lantz and Samara Strauss*

- **Charles Worthington, CTO at the VA**
  - Oversees team made of  digital service, some folks who are hired in, and the presidential innovation fellows (e.g. Clarice).  All working toward the same goal of managing/tending VA.gov and consolidating everything into one website.
    - Been with VA 3-4 years
    - His background is that he also used to be digital service, but part of the original 2013/2014 digital service people. He is very normal, very nice, "one of us".  
    - Despite his title, he is "one of us" and approachable. Very tech savvy. We don't need to hold his hand.  
  - Why talk to Charles: He'll have a lot of high level opinions about the homepage. 
    - Some folks fall into a "it should be a dashboard" camp and others into "this page should be a router" - can't remember where he falls. We'll learn in the interview
    - He'll also oversee what Clarices is working on (does the VA need an official app?) which will tie back to our work
    - Probably won't have opinions about "you should have this specific widget here"
- **Chris Johnston, oversees the DEPO team**
  - Been with the VA 3 years. Oversaw and managed the consolidation of vets.gov into va.gov. 
  - Why talk to Chris: Has a lot of insight into why it is the way it is now.  
    - Will be high level, like Charles.  
    - As he is overseeing and managing our team on a really high level, he will have a lot of insider knowledge about the homepage
- **Lauren Alexanderson, oversees healthcare portfolio**
  - Their big focus right now is the VA moving to Cerner (medical care mgmt platform); she's overseeing all of that work. 

    - Also managing the COVID-19 response.  May be hard to schedule time with her 
    - If she's just unavailable in the next 2 weeks, we'll get her at another time
  - Why talk to Lauren: She will have a lot of thoughts and opinions on 
    - what needs to show on a logged in homepage as it relates to healthcare tools
    - Possibly some kind of healthcare-is dashboard. 
    - What we'd need to show if myhealtheVet goes away (larger goal at VA)
  - In her interview, ask specifically about

    - Healthcare 
    - If myhealthEVet didn't exist, what do we need to show on our dashboard/logged in homepage
- **Samara Strauss, oversees Authenticated Experience team**
  - Why talk to Samara: She's been on the auth exp team for a couple years now and has a lot of background knowledge and insight into 
    - the homepage
    - myVA
    - general thoughts on what we need to do to improve homepage and myVA
  - Convo guide works for her
- **Clarice Chan, Presidential innovation fellow**
  - She has spent the last year helping set up notification for veterans to receive text message reminders about their healthcare appointments. On va.gov we have something where they can opt in or out to receive health care appointment reminders
  - Why talk to Clarice:
    - Has a lot of background in thinking through notifications and things like that
    - Also starting to work with a team to do research on whether we need a VA mobile app
    - Another ad hoc team working on discovery for that. She's managing that
    - Working w/ Samara to reconcile how these two initiatives are related
    - Background on what they're doing will be helpful
  - In her interview, ask specifically about

    - Mobile app

- **Steve Kovacs, works for the Digital Service, his team manages eBenefits migration**
  - Been with the VA for ~3 years. Originally was the PO for the auth experience team, left the team well over a year ago. 
  - Why talk to Steve:  He oversaw the v1, MVP of everything. Profile, account, myVA dashboard, etc
    - Working on building all of the tools that exist on eBenefits onto VA.gov so we can eventually shut down eBenefits
    - Will be able to give insight into what has moved over, what is moving over, what does their roadmap look like, 
    - Gives us a sense of tools we'd have and would likely need to accommodate on a dashboard/logged in homepage, etc
- **Andrea Schneider, manages both BaM teams, which work on benefit applications**
  - Her primary area of focus into this is the 526 disability work and the disability process
  - Why talk to Andrea: Good person to ask about the disability flow, and what type of stuff someone who is applying or managing their benefits might want to/need to see during that process
    - We don't need to become experts in those processes, but having a sense of "okay if I'm managing my benefits, these are the applications I might see in any point in the process, or my claim status"  
    - Generally understanding how that process works and could impact our work would be helpful.
  - In her interview, ask specifically about
    - Does she have specific opinions on the dashboard/homepage as it relates to disabilities? Okay if not
- **Matt Self, manages Education portfolio**
  - Not exactly sure what they're working on right now. Has primarily worked in that sphere.
  - Why talk to Matt:  He can share same type of insights for edu benefits that Andrea can share for disability.  
  - Any specifics to focus on?
    - Does he have specific opinions on the dashboard/homepage as it relates to education benefits? Okay if not
- **Jen Lee, manages the unauthenticated experience.**
  - Why talk to Jen: Good to check in with her to see how her team see that evolving over time and how that may affect what we do with a logged in experience.  
  - In her interview, ask specifically about:
    - In what ways to do you see the unauthorized experience changing over the next year or so?
    - If we were to re-design the logged in homepage with better access to tools, where do you see the unauthorized homepage going? Leave the same, update?
- **Ryan Thurlwell, doesn't manage a portfolio but a designer on the DEPO team.**
  - Had been working with Andy Lewandowski again before he left the team, and Jen and Mikki.  They've been talking about this thing about "what if we flatten the IA?". 
  - Why talk to Ryan: Talk to him about the mock-ups he's created. He has done explorations, but hasn't fully thought everything through, interaction design and all that. 
  - Learn about what he did, get inspiration 
  - In his interview, ask specifically about:
    - Talk through his thought process for the designs he's created
- **Mel Woodard, original designer for the dashboard and blue sky prototype**
  - No longer on the team
  - Why talk to Mel: She could maybe talk about some of that early work she did and the prototype she created. She may not remember though.
  - Learn about what she did, get inspiration
  - In her interview, ask specifically about:
    - Talk through her thought process for the designs she created
- **Mikki Northius, manages IA for va.gov**
  - Why talk to Mikki: She is doing exploration on flattening the IA 
  - Talk to her about where that is.
  - She also has a million things on her plate, may be hard to schedule time with
  - Can talk to us about her effort, having some of that documented more formally would be helpful
- **Dave Conlon, manages facility locator team**
  - Why talk to Dave:  Not sure he'll have any opinions, but he might and it'd be good to get a sense of what he does and if that work affects us in any way.  

**Stakeholders added post meeting via Slack:**

- John Hashimoto, will be working with Jen Lee on unauthenticated experience
- Kevin Hoffman, head of platform and all-around smart person to include
- Andy Lewandowski, now with OPM
  - Led the vets.gov > va.gov design.
  - There have been talks about when Andy was still on the team "what if we make the logged out homepage a big thing that says 'you need to log in to manage your tools'"
  - Will have insights into logged in/vs logged out homepage
  
30 min would probably be enough for most people on the list.

People who warrant longer conversation might not have enough time to schedule; can figure out follow-up meetings when 30 minutes isn't enough.
