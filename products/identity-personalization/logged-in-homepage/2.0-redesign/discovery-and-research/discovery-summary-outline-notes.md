# Logged-in homepage: Discovery summary

1.	Background
2.	What we did
  - Stakeholder interviews
  - Previous research review
  - Comparative analysis
  - Analytics review
  - User research
  - Additionally, there is the HKS research, which we did not do but is a helpful resource
3.	Key findings
  - People want a logged-in homepage tailored to them. 
  - User research
  - Stakeholder interviews
  - Health care and disability are king.
  - User research
  - Analytics
  - But health care and disability aren’t the only benefits people care about.
  - User research
  - Analytics
  - This homepage needs to work at every phase of the veteran lifecycle, even when a veteran has no updates and no benefits.
  - User research
  - Past research (Frog research report)
  - Not everything needs to be a “widget” — the best structure highlights the most important information and is easy to scan.
  - User research
  - Previous research review
  - Comparative analysis
  - (Process section instead?) We’ll need to revisit existing design patterns in order to create a usable homepage.
  - User research (positive reaction to blue sky prototype)
  - Previous research review (findings from personalization 2.0 readout)
  - The homepage does not exist in a vacuum — it needs to be supported by a cohesive logged-in navigation.
  - User research (blue sky prototype; general discussion about accessing tools)
  - Stakeholder interviews
  - Analytics
  - Veterans expect notifications outside of VA.gov, but they also want new information to be clear to them when they log in.
  - User research
  - Comparative analysis
4. Recommendations
  - Projects — Ultimately, this really comes down to 3 projects:
  - Logged-in homepage
  - Phase 1: Focus on initial widgets in “top tasks” area
  - Phase 2: Focus on benefits discovery
  - Note: Some of this will inevitably be part of phase 1 since we can’t launch without a “blank” state.
  - Additional iterations and improvement over time
  - Navigation
  - We need to revisit the logged-in navigation.
  - This will need to be iterative work that happens over time in concert with the IA team and the PW team.
  - Can happen side-by-side with logged-in homepage work pending resources.
  - Notification center
  - We should have a notification center on VA.gov but we should not rely on that as our only means of notifying veterans.
  - Can happen side-by-side with logged-in homepage work pending resources.
  - Process
  - Approach project iteratively (as outlined above)
  - Stakeholder management
  - User test, user test, user test
  - Metrics
  - Measuring success 
5.	Next steps
  - Start moving into design planning
  - Start discussing this with stakeholders outside DEPO
  - Continue work on OKRs & KPIs and getting analytics set up
  - Technical discovery
  - Initial V1 comps

**Findings & recs intro**

- Maybe — A comment on why we should feel justified in this work.
  - User testing: Current homepage/authenticated experience does not meet user's expectations for what they would expect to see in a logged-in state.
  - User testing: It is clear just how much people log in and expect to see something tailored to *them*.

**UI recs**

- Emphasize claim status tool and health care tools.
  - Most used in analytics.
  - May see these as the most important in user testing.
  - Health care is the only thing people really manage long term anyway.
  - This doesn't mean we may not show other select important statuses (applications in flight, GI bill balance).
- Notifications should be at the top of the page, accessible from anywhere.
  - Ubiquitous pattern seen in comparative analysis.
  - Most people enter from homepage, but this will make notifications accessible from anywhere.
- The body of the logged-in homepage/dashboard should show general status/progress info regardless of whether there is a notification update for that info or not. 
  - We don't want to rely on notifications only for the logged-in homepage, otherwise there will be a lot of times people come to their logged-in homepage only to see it blank/not have any meaningful actions to take.
  - Comparative analysis: Dashboards aren't only notification info. Even if the info is dynamic, they have general "status"/about info, like account type and account balance.

Base this on user testing:

- What we should put on the dashboard:
  - How much of this is status/"in flight" content (eg. claim status, in progress applications, upcoming appointments)?
  - How much of this is "about me" (eg. disability rating)?
  - Something about how to handle records?
  - Something about how to handle learning about new benefits?

**Process recs**

- Be strategic about involving outside stakeholders.
  - To avoid lengthy churn or the page becoming a dumping ground.
- Approach the redesign iteratively.
  - To avoid analysis paralysis (stakeholder interviews).
  - Because we see in analytics just how reliant people are on the top 20 tasks.
  - Because the logged in experience should be a system that works together, and we don't have a specific logged in nav OR notifications OR a logged in homepage. This all needs to work together and we don't want to take forever making it perfect.
  - **In what order should we approach this redesign (eg. the nav? some homepage widgets? notifications?)**
- User test, user test, user test.
  - This page is too imporatnt to user test once.
  - We saw in our research review that the 2018 homepage was tested at least 6 times to get to the right approach.
  - This will also allow us to design with users, build more iteratively, and make meaningful updates.

**Challenges**

Not sure whether we should include this as a separate section or just mention challenges contextually throughout.

- Getting to a better overall logged-in experience will require navigation work, which means we need to work closely with the public websites team, Mikki, and Meg to make sure the unauthenticated nav and the authenticated nav can work in harmony.
