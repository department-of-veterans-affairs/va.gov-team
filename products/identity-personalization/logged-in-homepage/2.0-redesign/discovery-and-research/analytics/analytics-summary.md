# Logged-in homepage discovery: Analytics review

## Project overview

As part of the [logged-in homepage discovery effort](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/research-plan.md), we conducted an analytics review to learn more about user behavior related to VA.gov, the homepage, and the My VA dashboard.

## Goals

Analytics are an especially good way of seeing what people are doing. They can't tell us "why," but they can tell us "what." The data we looked at was especially good at giving us insight into the following:

- Why do people come to VA.gov? What do they do here?
- Who's using the homepage? Who's using My VA?
- How do people interact with the homepage?
- How do people interact with My VA?

## Analytics

Our incredible analytics team pulled a ton of data for us. All data referenced in this report is below. Unless otherwise noted, the timeline for each report is **April 12, 2019 — April 12, 2020**.

## Overall: Why do people come to the site? What do they do here?

### To get the full picture, we needed to look at both the "modernized" and "non-modernized" data.

Data can be divided into two major buckets — the data for the “modernized” site, which is the new VA.gov that our team relaunched in 2018, and data for the “non-modernized” VA web properties, which includes MyHealtheVet (myhealth.va.gov), eBenefits (ebenefits.va.gov), VBA's site (benefits.va.gov) and any other subdomains under VA.gov. We looked at both data sets to get the fullest picture of user behavior.

### On the modernized site (va.gov), the claim status tool is king.

Whether we are looking at data by pageviews **(~60MM)** or popular landing pages **(~5.4MM sessions)**, the claim status tool is the most popular tool on the modernized VA.gov outside of the homepage. Information on how to apply for disability benefits **(~2.6MM pageviews)** and the disability hub **(~1.7MM pageviews)** are also popular.

[Top 25 pages on the modernized VA.gov only](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/?authuser=0#/report/content-pages/a50123418w177519031p184624291/_u.date00=20190412&_u.date01=20200412&explorer-table.plotKeys=%5B%5D&explorer-table.rowCount=25&_.useg=builtin1/)

**Recommendation**: Emphasize the disability and claim products in the logged in experience, as this is a major reason people come to VA.gov.

### In the non-modernized data (VA.gov plus MHV, eBenefits, etc.), we can see just how important health care management is to the veteran population.

When looking at all of VA's main web properties, we can see that in addition to using the claim status tool, most people come to VA's online tools to manage their health care. MyHealtheVet's homepage got **~145MM** pageviews in the last year, vs. VA.gov's homepage, which got **~23MM**. On MyHealtheVet, veterans are most interested in **messaging their medical teams (~56MM pageviews)**, **refilling prescriptions (~47MM pageviews)**, and **viewing labs and tests (~25MM pageviews)**.

[Top pages between VA.gov, MHV, eBenefits, and more](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/report/content-pages/a50123418w177519031p176188361/_u.date00=20190412&_u.date01=20200412&explorer-table.plotKeys=%5B%5D&explorer-table.rowCount=5000&explorer-segmentExplorer.segmentId=analytics.pageTitle/)

**Recommendation**: Put health care tools front and center on the new logged-in homepage.

### In both the non-modernized and modernized data, we can see that people care about finding a VA location, getting records, and applying for education benefits.

In the non-modernized data, we see huge numbers of pageviews for the **finding a VA location (~30MM)**, various interactions to download personal records **(Blue button ~12.5MM; MHV's "Download My Data" tool ~8.8MM)**, and information on **applying for education benefits (~6.7MM)**.

On the modernized VA.gov only, we see similar interest in the **facility locator (~27MM)**, the **GI Bill statement of benefits (3.4MM)**, and the **download your VA letters tool (~2MM)**. 

[Top pages between VA.gov, MHV, eBenefits, and more](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/report/content-pages/a50123418w177519031p176188361/_u.date00=20190412&_u.date01=20200412&_.useg=&explorer-segmentExplorer.segmentId=analytics.pageTitle&explorer-table.plotKeys=%5B%5D&explorer-table.rowCount=50/)

**Recommendation**: Emphasize VA locations, personal records, and education benefits in the logged-in experience.

### My VA is more popular than we expected.

In the non-modernized data, we can see that My VA is more popular than we thought if we look at pageviews alone. This page makes it into the top 25 of all pages across VA web properties with about **~7.5MM views**. This may indicate an interest in seeing personalized benefit information.

[Top pages between VA.gov, MHV, eBenefits, and more](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/report/content-pages/a50123418w177519031p176188361/_u.date00=20190412&_u.date01=20200412&_.useg=&explorer-segmentExplorer.segmentId=analytics.pageTitle&explorer-table.plotKeys=%5B%5D&explorer-table.rowCount=50/)

**Recommendation**: Continue with plan to personalize the logged-in homepage. Also continue with plan to retire My VA, since the homepage still gets significantly more traction.

### People start on the homepage, the claim status tool, and the facility locator.

One of the questions we needed to answer in this research was: "do people actually start on the homepage, or do they enter the site directly through tools?" Across VA's digital properties, the MyHealtheVet **(~47MM sessions)**, VA.gov **(~22MM sessions)**, and eBenefits **(~20MM sessions)** homepages are peoples' main entrance points, which shows us that people tend to start at "home" to get themselves oriented before diving into tools.

In terms of tools, we can see in the modernized VA.gov site data that the **claim status tool (~5.4MM)** and the **facility locator (~2MM)** are popular entry points

**Recommendation**: Since people are orienting themselves on the homepage to navigate to tools, carefully balance widgets with links directly into tools.

### People are searching for general health and benefit information, forms, and some specific tasks we may want to do a better job of elevating.

On the modernized VA.gov:

- **"Benefits" (~150K)** and **"health" (~59K)** are the most searched terms. Given how generic these terms are, this may suggest that people are looking for more help and assistance from us on getting started with benefits.
- **"Forms" (~24K)** is also high on the list, which suggests people want a full list of VA forms.
- Benefits-related terms like **"direct deposit" (~13K)**, **"cemetery" (~10K)**, and **"certificate of eligibility" (~8K)** are high on the list, which suggests that we may need to elevate these tools more.
- **"DD214" (~9K)** is high on the list, further reflecting people's desire to get their military records.

**Recommendation**: Create more direct access to direct deposit, DD214, burial, and certificate of eligibility info in the logged-in experience, whether that is from the homepage or further elevating these items in a logged-in navigation.

## Logged-in vs. logged-out: Why do people come to the site? What do they do here?

**Note**: When looking at data by logged-in vs. logged-out users, we are only able to use modernized VA.gov site data. Our analytics are not able to track whether users log in via MyHealtheVet or eBenefits, so we cannot tell whether actions taken on those sites are taken from a logged-in or logged-out state.

### Logged-out users are more interested in exploring/applying for benefits.

"Explore/apply" content is popular on the modernized VA.gov. **How to apply for GI Bill/education benefits (~2.8MM)**, **disability content (~4MM)**, and **veteran ID card content (~3.2MM)**) all made it into the top 25 pages overall. 

However, when we look at top pages by logged-in vs. logged-out users, we can see that there are many more "explore/apply" pages in the top 25 results for logged-out users **(12 pages)** than logged-in users **(3 pages)**. For logged-out users, **how to apply for GI bill benefits (~1.6MM pageviews)**, **how to file a disability claim (~1.1MM pageviews)**, and **how to apply for health care (~1MM pageviews)** were the most popular "explore/apply" pages.

[Top 25 pages on the modernized VA.gov only](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/?authuser=0#/report/content-pages/a50123418w177519031p184624291/_u.date00=20190412&_u.date01=20200412&explorer-table.plotKeys=%5B%5D&explorer-table.rowCount=25&_.useg=builtin1/)

[Top 25 pages on the modernized VA.gov only: Logged-out sessions](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/?authuser=0#/report/content-pages/a50123418w177519031p184624291/_u.date00=20190412&_u.date01=20200412&_.useg=userBgZiUrK9Sieg7jBAnx44OQ&explorer-table.plotKeys=%5B%5D&explorer-table.rowCount=25/)

**Recommendation**: Long term, work with the unauthenticated/global UX team to figure out how we can seamlessly transition users from a logged-out to logged-in experience when users may have different needs ranging from exploring to managing benefits.

### Logged-in users are more interested in checking the status of their benefits or accessing their records. 

For logged-in users on the modernized VA.gov, there were **(7 tools)** in the top 25 pages and only **(3 "explore/apply)** pages. The **claim status tool (~31MM pageviews)**, **GI Bill statement of benefits (~4MM pageviews)**, **download your VA benefit letters (~3.8MM)**, **the facility locator (~2.4MM)**, and **refill and track prescriptions (~1.3MM)** all made it into the top 25.

Additionally, while we can't see a breakdown of what logged-in users do in the non-modernized site data, we know that all of the tools on MyHealtheVet require people to be logged in to use them. Therefore, we can extrapolate that the most popular tools besides the claim status tool are the health care tools, with **secure messages (~56MM pageviews)**, **prescriptions refills (~47MM pageviews)**, and **labs and tests (~25MM pageviews)** receiving the most use.

**Recommendation**: Create a tool/task-based navigation for logged in users, both on the logged-in homepage and throughout the authenticated experience.

## The homepage and My VA: How do people interact with these pages?

### About half of VA.gov users go to the homepage. Only about 8% of users go to My VA.

Of the modernized VA.gov's almost **8.7MM** users, about **49% (~4.3MM)** go to the homepage. Only about **8% (~700K)** go to My VA.

**Note**: Unlike other reports, this data is only for the first three months of the year — Jan 1 – Apr 2, 2020.

[Homepage vs. My VA user 3-month report](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/report/visitors-overview/a50123418w177519031p184624291/_u.date00=20200101&_u.date01=20200402&_.useg=builtin1,userDatUa-iUR--ymOCPRsvErg,userTBuj9_dPSF-sBQQO9Srv-g&overview-graphOptions.primaryConcept=analytics.totalVisitors/)

**Recommendation**: Given significantly lower activity, continue with plan to retire My VA permanently.

### Most people start directly on the homepage, but some people reorient themselves their throughout their session.

The bulk of the homepage's views are as people's entrance **(25MM pageviews)** into VA.gov. In smaller numbers, people re-orient themselves on the homepage throughout their session. The **claim status tool (~2.4MM pageviews)**, **view payment history (~455K pageviews)**, and **refill and track prescriptions (~360K pageviews)** were some of the top pages people were on before they made their way back to the homepage.

### From the homepage, people primarily navigate into the tools displayed in the top 20 tasks. 

As expected, almost all of the top 25 interactions on the homepage take place in the top 20 tasks, with notable exceptions being the sign in prompt and some interaction with the main nav. In the top 20 tasks, **Check your claim or appeal status (~5MM)**, **View payment history (~760K)**, and **Refill and track your prescriptions (~516K)** had the most clicks.

This further shows the reliance on the top 20 tasks and suggests we should take extra care with how we handle these when creating a personalized logged-in homepage.

**Recommendation**: For the logged-in homepage, take an iterative approach to changing the top tasks since people are so reliant on using these to navigate around.

### People come to My VA via many of the same paths that lead them to the homepage, just in smaller numbers.

People come to My VA through **sign in (~600K)**, the **claim status tool (~393K)**, and **view payment history (~75K)** just like they do on the homepage. They just do so in a much smaller quantity.

**Recommendation**: Given significantly lower activity, continue with plan to retire My VA permanently.

### Login is the primary action taken from My VA.

Since you can't view My VA without being logged in, it's interesting that the most popular action by far from My VA is to **log in (~5MM events)**. This may suggest that people are going directly to this page and signing in from here, potentially people who have bookmarked this page.

**Recommendation**: Redirect My VA URL to the homepage once we retire the page.

### Claims, VA letters, and profile information are all popular next steps from My VA.

Unsurprisingly, people who come to My VA have the same priorities as other users — they want to **track claims (~560K)** and **download their VA letters (~240K)**, among other things. They also want to go to their **profile (~305K)**.

**Recommendation**: Given overall popularity of these tools throughout the analytics, emphasize them on the logged-in homepage.
