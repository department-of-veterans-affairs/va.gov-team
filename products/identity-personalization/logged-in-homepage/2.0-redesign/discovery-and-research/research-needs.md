# Logged in homepage: Research needs

This doc outlines our research/discovery needs for the new logged in homepage. Given that Samara and Clarice's availability is limited, we're hoping a clear outline will help us figure out what parts of this discovery phase can be managed by us and where we might need to bring in additional resources.

## Project background

Prior to the launch of the redesigned VA.gov in November 2018, the logged in homepage on Vets.gov was a personalized dashboard that allowed veterans to view their in-progress applications, claims, messages, and prescriptions. When the new VA.gov launched, this dashboard was renamed My VA and moved toot a different location; users' logged in homepage remained the same as the logged out homepage.

As time has gone on, My VA has grown but scaled poorly due to the structure set in the MVP. Additionally, the logged in homepage and My VA have competed for veteran attention and focus and are largely redundant of each other. What differs is their approach — the logged in homepage is primarily a router, while My VA is very much a dashboard.

Through [research we did over the summer](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/personalization%202.0/discovery-research/dashboard-interviews/research-summary.md), we determined that it's time to revisit both My VA and the logged in homepage. [We have proposed conslidating these two pages into one](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/personalization%202.0/discovery-research/README.md#key-takeaway-we-need-to-revisit-our-my-va-logged-in-homepage-approach) by getting rid of My VA altogether and treating the logged-in homepage as a user's personalized landing pad and router. 

While we're sure of what we want to do, the exact approach is still undefined. We would like to complete a discovery phase in order to help us better define user expectations, stakeholder needs, and what tools we need to include on the new logged in homepage.

## Research needs

We'd like to complete the following as part of this discovery effort:

- [Previous research review](#previous-research-review)
- [Analytics review](#analytics-review)
- [User interviews/testing](#user-interviewstesting)
- [Stakeholder interviews](#stakeholder-interviews)
- [Research synthesis](#research-synthesis)

### Product questions we're trying to answer

We're broadly trying to figure out how to create a more useful logged in homepage, one that is the most useful blend of dashboard/personal information and links to tools. We want to do a better job than we are now of showing veterans the full picture of their care at the VA in one place, and a better job of helping them complete the tasks they come to VA.gov to complete.

To help us figure this out, we'd like to better understand:

- Why people come to VA.gov.
- What people do on VA.gov
- How people move through the site.
- How people use the homepage.
- How people use My VA.
- Areas for improvement for existing functionality.
- How people's experience with the site might change if we had a proper notification system.

### Previous research review

We'd like to go through previous research that has happened on VA.gov that's informed what we have now or what we might like to have/improve in the future. With this context, we can make sure this next research project is supplemental and not redundant of previous research.

This is a non-exhaustive list of some of the previous research that would inform this work. In the event someone else was able to help us with this work, we'd help find any additional research/resources we wanted to be considered.

### Analytics review

We want to look at analytics to get a better sense of how users behave at scale. We plan to look into the following:

#### General

- What are the top ~20  pages visited on VA.gov?
  - How does this change if we look at top pages for logged out users vs. logged in users?
- What are the top ~20 search terms on VA.gov?
- What are the top ~20 entry points for VA.gov?
- After people enter the site, what is the next thing they do?
- % of traffic by device (desktop; tablet; mobile).

#### Homepage

- What page do people visit BEFORE the homepage?
- How often is the homepage people's first entry point?
- What links do people click from the homepage?
- How many people visit the homepage?

#### My VA

- What page do people visit BEFORE My VA?
- Is My VA ever a first entry point?
- What do people do from My VA? (ie. what links do they click?)
- How many people visit My VA? 

This is [already in-progress](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/6322) and we will likely not need any help beyond considering analytics in synthesis.

### User interviews/testing

Even with previous research and an analytics review, we feel strongly that talking to veterans would help us further clarify what users need from the logged in homepage. Analytics can tell us what; user interviews and testing can tell us why.

#### Questions we have

- Why do people log in to VA.gov?
- Why do people go to the homepage?
- Why do people go to My VA?
- What makes the logged in homepage useful now? What would make it more useful?
- What makes My VA useful? What would make it more useful than it is now?
- Where do people expect to see/receive notifications? How would notifications be most helpful to people?
- What do they expect to see on a logged in homepage?
- Are people overly reliant on the homepage for navigation because the logged in navigation doesn’t do a good job at elevating tools?
- Why do people come to VA.gov? What do they want to do?
- What is the balance between dashboard vs. router?
- What are the main things people do on VA digital tools/VA.gov?
- Pain points
- Do people trust the data they see on VA.gov?

#### Tasks

- Create a research plan/design
- Create a conversation guide/script
- Recruit participants (note: we can use the VA contractor, Perigean, to help us recruit and schedule)
- Conduct research
- Synthesize

#### Thoughts on methods

- Some of the research will likely be in interview format
- We may or may not want to show users the following:
  - The existing logged in homepage
  - My VA
  - [This blue sky protoype of a logged in VA.gov](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/d/main?origin=v7#/projects/prototypes/13596891?scrollOffset=216)
  
#### Additional user research

- We are open to additional user research beyond interviews if it would be helpful in us getting answers to our questions.

### Stakeholder interviews

#### Who

For this work, our stakeholders are all part of DEPO. We recommend at least a 30 minute chat to gather needs/thoughts/opinions from the following folks.

These people probably have lots of opinions:

- Charles Worthington
- Chris Johnston
- Lauren Alexanderson
- Samara Strauss (if I'm not doing the interviews)

These people may have some opinions:

- Steve Kovacs
- Andrea Schneider
- Matt Self
- Jen Lee
- Ryan Thurlwell

#### Tasks

- Create a conversation guide/script
- Conduct interviews
- Synthesize

### Research synthesis

Post research, everything needs to be sythesized and final recommendations need to be made. This could take on a few different shapes if someone else is helping out:

1. The researcher synthesizes the activities above, but Samara/Clarice do the final synthesis and recommendations.
2. The research/Sanara/Clarice all work together on the final synthesis and recommendations.
3. The research does all the final synthesis and recommendations and presents those to our team.

The approach probably determines on a few factors and should be determined with input from the researcher, should someone besides Samara/Clarice be helping.
