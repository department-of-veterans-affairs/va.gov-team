# Logged-in homepage Past Research Review

**Digital Services Veterans Affairs (DSVA), VSA, Authenticated Experience**

Liz Lantz (liz@adhocteam.us), 04/22/2020

## Background

As part of discovery for a new logged-in homepage, we reviewed previous research conducted between 2016-2019. The goal of this review is to establish a foundation for the designer(s) tackling the logged-in homepage redesign, and to guide future user interviews so they are unique and answer new questions.

## Studies Reviewed

### Personalization 2.0

**[Personalization 2.0 Discovery: Summary and Strategy](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/personalization%202.0/discovery-research/README.md)**

- **Goals:** Evaluate usefulness of My VA dashboard and relationship to the homepage, and better understand service member experience vs veteran experience and impacts to our work.
- **Findings**:
  - My VA dashboard isn't used much, and is duplicative of the homepage.  
  - The visual design of My VA isn't scaleable or scannable.  
  - VA.gov users expect an experience tailored to them, and are task-oriented.
  - We need an onboarding experience.

**[Dashboard 2.0 User Interviews Research Summary](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/personalization%202.0/discovery-research/dashboard-interviews/research-summary.md)**

This research rolled up into the larger Personalization 2.0 report linked above and reported similar findings to what is described above.

- **Findings**:
  - Benefit categories were easily understood.
  - Veterans responded positively to the simplicity and layout of the homepage, and the homepage exposed Veterans to benefits they may not have considered.

  - Key login tasks worked such as signing in and out, completing MHV and eBN tasks from homepage, and seeing dashboard data.
  - Veterans had a hard time finding My VA and MY Health in top right of the page.
  - Deep links into eBenefits were not useful.

### My VA Research

**[Original pre-launch usability testing (April 2018)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Identity/Personalization/research/April%202018%20usability/Personalization%20MVP%20readout.pptx)**

- **Findings:**
  - Dashboard was helpful and easy for users to understand. 
  - Generally, users demonstrated understanding of the content, features, and functionality they were presented with.
  - Participants expressed interest in notifications, and changing the order of modules on the dashboard to reflect their personal preferences and activity.
  - Participants relied on links in the dashboard to get to settings instead of using main nav.

**["Find VA Benefits" user testing (September 2018)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Identity/Personalization/Recommendations/Research/MVP%20Research/User%20Testing/Research%20Summary.md)**

- **Goals:** Evaluate Find VA Benefits tool MVP to better understand the flow, utility, and interactions.

- **Findings:**
  - People found the **Update** and **Decision** blocks to be helpful, but had mixed feelings about being able to remove them. 
  - People want to see meaningful next steps in their notifications
  - We should consider organizing the dashboard by benefit type; the new "Manage your VA Health Care" section of the dashboard met participants' expectations. 

## Journey maps

**[Veteran Journey Map](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)** 

This provides an overview of the 10 life stages any Veteran may encounter.  This is a good resource to build an understanding of how Veteran's needs change over time, and inspire thinking around how our design can adapt to support them through those changes.

**[VA patient experience map](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veterans%20Outpatient%20Journey%20Map.pdf)** 

This resource traces the outpatient experience from the perspective of the employee, and provides insights into painpoints Veterans experience related to receiving care from their provider. 

**Benefit specific journey maps**

Each of the following journey maps go into detail about a specific benefit journey. Journeys begin from application to receipt of benefits, focusing on actions needed and veterans' positive, negative, and neutral feelings. We should use these resources to familiarize ourselves with the processes for each of these benefits and inform how we might highlight them on the new logged-in homepage.

**[Disabilities claim process map](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20-%20Disability%20Claim%20-%2011x17%20-%20%209.4.17.pdf)** 

**[Education benefits map](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Edu%20Journey%20Map_110518_v6.pdf)** 

**[Pension journey map](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Pension%20Journey%20Map_011119_V5.pdf)**

## Research done by outside groups

**[Benefit planning, applications, and claims research conducted by Frog in 2016](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/files/4446518/D5_frog_VCRD_ResearchReadout_final.pdf)** (see slides 31-97)

This comprehensive research study goes into great detail around the overall benefit journey, from transition to managing information online.  While we've made improvements since then, there is a lot here that is still relevant to our work on a logged-in homepage update.  Recommendations that are still particularly relevant:

- Serve up benefits information that is personal and relevant to the Veteran based on what is known about each individual.
- Enable Veterans to get snapshot views and take common actions quickly.
- Aggregate personal information and documents in one location.
