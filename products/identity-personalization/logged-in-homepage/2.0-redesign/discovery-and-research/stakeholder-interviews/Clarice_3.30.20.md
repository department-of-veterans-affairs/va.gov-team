## Stakeholder interview with Clarice Chan 3.30.20

### What is your role?

I am a presidential innovation fellow working under Charles Worthington since last January. I’ve been focusing and looking at how we improve communications, including notifications and veteran correspondence. The VA has been communicating the same way for 70 years — via paper mail. How do we get them to use more modern tools — email, text, etc? How that integrates with VA.gov — I’ve been partnering with business lines on how they are communicating and making sure we’re… (missed this)

Working with settings and profiles team to make sure we are elevating preferences so veterans have control over notification (e.g. subscribe or unsubscribe) so they can know what’s going on with their claims and applications at the VA.

### Who do you work with?

The VETText team, which is a 4 person team outside of Loma-Linda. They all started part time and had day jobs — (mentioned each person and role by name). They spend time outside of their main VA hours to build this service. 

Outside of that, the VA Profile team (formerly Vet360) — they do identity brokering, contact information storage, etc etc. 

Connecting this all together, the business lines come to us with notifications needs and the idea is that we build a central, convening thing that allows multiple business lines to take advantage of this thing. The stakeholders could be infinite. There could be a number of touchpoints to getting an email you’ve been enrolled in health care or that we’ve processed your claim.

There are two other vendor teams:

-	Bylight — they did the FE work to implement the notification setting
-	ThoughtWorks — Coming on to build a notifications engine

### What do you mean by they were brought in to “build out the setting”?

[Didn’t get this verbatim, but Clarice went on to describe where the health care appointment notification is in the VA.gov profile]

### As far in the logged in homepage, were you involved in Vets.gov  VA.gov?

No.

### Problems with My VA/Logged in homepage?

The biggest challenge is that we don’t have a strong sense of logged in personalization, so the page doesn’t change when you aren’t logged in vs. when you are logged in.

Coming from the private sector, there’s a big switch when you are logged out vs. logged in — (listed examples from different services).

Biggest gap — (missed this)

### How would this update impact your work?

It would create a new place to leverage that work. Today, we’re just finding places to put notifications in existing settings, which is the wrong place for them to live from a UX perspective. When you go in to change settings, there’s a separate place to update your notifications. Users wouldn’t go to “settings” to update notifications.  I think it makes sense for those things to live in a logged in homepage or notification centers.

### Tell me about the mobile app work.

This is in discovery. A sprint was done at the same time as the vets.gov work was underway, so there’s already a pretty robust landscape in terms of how this would work, why we would invest. But this was put on a shelf because vets.gov hadn’t launched yet. So instead of putting the cart before the horse, they (launched the website).

Now, we’re trying to figure out if this is the right time to do this, what would it do… etc. We’re doing a discovery on that. The assumption is a logged-in experience is not to browse, it’s to see your claims, appointments, and notifications. The app work stream is in its infancy, it’s not on the books. We’re doing an exploration to see what the benefits are and see how it would benefit a mobile/logged in homepage experience.

### How would the app be different than the website?

Philosophically, the pages are feeding the same data. If we do have a logged in homepage, it has your claims, status, prescriptions, and the push for a logged in homepage… if we do build an app, at a minimum, it needs to show what’s available on the logged-in homepage. 

For an app, the tailored feature would be push notifications, (something else). 1/3 of eBenefits and VA.gov is just people logging in to see your claim status. About 37% of traffic to VA.gov is mobile traffic. The complimentary-ness is that a lot of people are using this on mobile. If we had push notifications or communication lines, here’s what we need from you or here is how you were rated, that communication is fragmented today and is done on paper. This is why people have to log in every day. So there are some unique benefits to the mobile form factor — push notifications and logging in being two of them.

Depending on the business line… take a picture with your phone to get updated info for direct deposit. Phone as a device provides this connection model that other businesses use in really smart ways and the VA has none of that.

### What are your goals for a new logged in homepage experience?

Yeah, in terms of goals — I would pair that with key metrics we’re trying to improve. If we deliver a better, more personal experience, I’m hoping that things veterans need to do/be notified of can be done in a more efficient way. Example — we could get more phone numbers. Right now, they serve 28 million veterans but we only have 12 million phone numbers. We could get more connected and get more user data.

For VBA — it takes 100 days to process a claim. 90 of those days are just gathering evidence. 90 days of veterans logging in to see the status, and the communication is (caught up in the mail). (Clarice described this process more). So I think if there was more personalization, that would bring us to the ultimate goal of how do we reduce the amount of time to receive services. 100 days is pretty ridiculous. (We don’t see these timelines in the private sector)

### Are there metrics that you want to see?

I wonder if the logged in homepage would lead to more self service, fewer calls to call centers, etc. I hypothesize that because our claim status tool is a little buggy, that regardless of a veteran checking it, they’ll call to have a real person pulling up the file. If we had a dashboard that had a bit more detail and we did it successfully, we’d bring down the need for veterans to call the call centers.

(Talked about how ridiculous it is for veterans to have to prove they served and the work we expect VSOs and veterans to do to know all the benefit eligibility requirements. Talked about how a personalized dashboard could offer this information to veterans instead of having them find the information on their own)

### What does success look like?

I think it would be successful if there is high engagement on the page. Not necessarily traffic since it’s the de facto page when they log in, but engagement in clicking and getting the information they need. I think that in addition to those pieces, success would be user feedback — “this was helpful, I didn’t need to call because this is here…” Or even just user feedback around “this made doing business with the VA easy or seamless.” I think user feedback would be a strong metric.

Internally, more buy-in and stakeholder consolidation. So instead of teams investing their silo’d approach, they don’t want to build their own dashboard or portal, they want to work with the VA.gov team. So we’re one organization, one brand, and we’re building that trust internally.

###Is there anything you think of that makes this project easier/harder?

The app piece? I think being able to use code and components is key, so not building one notification for one platform and then another for a different one.

I think other than that… IDK… to the notifications piece… some section so that notifications are centralized, either a notification center or newsfeed so the stuff is front and center. A to-do list so veterans know what they need to do.

### What concerns do you have?

Concerns would be I hope we get the granularity of information right. We don’t want information galore so that it’s not helpful, but we don’t want it to be too-surface… getting the right level of info of what people want to know is key.

The other thing that Samara has brought up is all the different views… some veterans have a ton of things open and some have nothing going on — how do we create the personalized portal for the new veteran to the veteran who has an overload of stuff?
