# Stakeholder interview with Andrea Schneider 4.1.20

### Tell me about your role and what you do in your work on va.gov

Technically, I am the PM on the BAM team. I’m focused on delivering products in the benefits space, in addition to a lot of other things that go on around VA>gov and our contract. But the primary focus is helping my team to be successful building products to that end.

(Which BAM team?) We’re all building into the same space. Matt Self is PM on BAM2, Steve Kovacs is the PM on eBenefits team, but all of us are in the same are together. But I lead the portfolio and have a team (BAM).

### How long have you been in this role?

At the VA - 2+ years. Portfolio-wise — since the fall.

### Who are the people and teams you work most closely with?

Matt, Steve. Seeing how everything sits on public websites, we have to be integrating with IA, landing pages to our apps. So I would definitely consider PW team our main interactions. One interaction I’d like to have longer term is working with auth exp — how do we present things to veterans through their dashboard and what we want them to do?

### How were you involved with the vets.gov to va.gov transition, as it pertains to the logged in homepage/myVA experience?

I was, but I was somewhat insulated from it though. My focus was on just trying to launch this one product. So I just stayed in my lane on that one thing and didn’t have a lot of interaction with the folks working on it.

### What problems have you noticed about the current logged in homepage and myVA experiences?

It doesn’t differentiate. The website as it is for an unauth user is the same as it is for someone who is logged in except for the nav. Otherwise, the experience I feel like it’s pretty much the same. 

(Can you elaborate?) Because we know so much about veterans, and if they are logged in, we can provide them with a much more targeted experience of what they are trying to do and make them of aware of the things they could/are able to do vs. the vast amount of info available on VA.gov for users who we don’t know who you are or what you are trying to achieve. Once you are logged in, we can allow a veteran to accomplish a task in a better/fast way, help them with their particular situation of tasks they need to complete they weren’t aware of, or things they can take advantage of. We can target the outcomes based on knowing more about who you are.

### How would an update to the logged in homepage experience impact your work?

(What are your opinions related to disability benefits and the dashboard?) Having veterans understand what their current situation is… we just launched “view my rated disability” so a veteran can see their exact rating right now. Being able to see that on a dashboard would help them continue to be familiar with where they are currently, especially around veterans who want to be able to apply to get an increase to their disability. 

Most veterans commit to memory what their ratings are, but let’s say hypothetically your rating for you knee injury is at 10% and you’re sustaining more problems because it’s getting worse. Then you see on your dashboard that it’s 10% and you see a link to apply for an increase. We can tie these things together from a health + benefits perspective. We want to aggregate and conglomerate this info to how it can affect/influence your benefits. 

A more concrete example — info we know from VHA for what you’re getting treated for. If you’re not already getting treated for that, we can say this health condition might qualify you for this disability which general has a rating of whatever, and here is how you can apply for it. Just making that info super clear to a veteran on how they can apply for that condition.

### What are your goals for a new logged in homepage experience?

We know your home address, if you’re never been to a VAMC, we should show that and not make you go to facility locator to find that.

My only warning in this is that we have to avoid the “creepy” factor. How much do we really want veterans to think “oh, they know everything and now I don’t want to have anything to do with it.” (Basically balancing the line between what we know and the “creepy” factor).

I would want the logged in experience to allow the veteran to feel like they had control over it. Still on the creepy factor — yeah, it’s OK you can contact me for these things and have that be obvious that they can control what’s there. I know for a while it was a fad to customize things on websites. I never did that because I didn’t want to miss out on something. Still having that sense of control I thought was important.

I also want to make sure that we don’t provide them with info that they are already dealing with/researching/know about. We shouldn’t be telling people to apply for the GI bill if they are already receiving that benefit. I want to make sure the logged in experience reflects that we know these things about a veteran and aren’t necessary to repeat again.

### What does success look like to you? How would you know this project has succeeded?

User satisfaction is sort of an easy go to on that one. 

### What metrics would you be interested in seeing around a logged in homepage?

Looking at the most commonly viewed pages and seeing how that would relate to a logged in state. Are there pages that are really important to veterans that we can expose through logged in experience that they are not seeing today? Or even taking pieces of most important pages and having that be one of the things that we would measure? Is that still the most important thing in a logged in state? 

So claim status – if that is there when you logged in, does that reduce the need to go to that page? How can we present info in a consolidated way… it’s weird to say you want to see numbers go down on a page, but it may be better that veterans can see something on a dashboard instead of going to a page.

### What logged in homepage/dashboard experiences have you come across that work well, and not so well? How about notifications?

Online banking is an easy one, because it’s the difference between an unauth state in banking is all marketing, and the logged in state is all what you are there to see. I want to log in to see my balance, but I don’t want to see that on the public website.

### What might make this project easier or harder in any specific ways, as it relates to your role on va.gov, or your team?

Idk what the stakeholder situation is going to look like for this. Are we going to be able to decide what we think is the most important information to include in a logged in experience? Are there factors from our business stakeholders that might influence how this goes? And what happens if those are competing?

Thinking about the VA.gov team when they were creating the top tasks — how were they able to control what that looked like among a really large group of stakeholders with vetting/buy-in.

The other thing that might make this harder is trying to figure out how we support it, like the call center aspect of it. Having people at the call center talking to a veteran about problems they are having VA.gov. Our support isn’t great — introducing this divergent experience where the veteran has a logged in and logged out state. The veteran can see something the call center isn’t aware of. I’m wondering if it would cause any different support needed from one version of the website to another.

### What are concerns do you have about this project? What do you imagine going wrong?

If we’re putting all this info into one place, if info is pulling and it’s conflicting. For example, we are hearing examples of veterans seeing their data as one thing in one place and it’s different in the other. (Gives example of the addresses on veteran benefits letters being different). (If data is different, how do veterans trust us?)

You mentioned you’d been thinking about authenticated experiences in government for 20 years? What have you been thinking about related to this?

The first time I have ever worked on authenticated experiences was a project to envision what it would look like for someone to log in to their government website — so a super dashboard fed by all the different agencies that had information about you. The VA is part of that in my mind. Is there an opportunity to take this logged in experience and federate it with other experiences that influence it? 

For example, with the pension world, when you apply for a pension, you have to give the IRS permission to verify your income so you can get a pension — can we take this experience and tie them all together? Can you take an action on VA.gov that promulgates out to another agency where the data is interrelated where we could have a much bigger picture of the veteran experience? There is a lot of ways in which the VA is dependent on other organizations that the veteran doesn’t know about. How could we use this to thread the needle?
