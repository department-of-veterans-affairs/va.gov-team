# Stakeholder interview with Lauren Alexanderson 4.3.20

### Tell me about your role and what you do in your work on va.gov.

My role is that I am the health product line lead for the V, so that is inclusive of veteran-facing products, clinician facing products, and the data analytics that support those things.

### How long have you been in this role?

August 2019. I’ve been with DSVA for ~3 years.

(Prior to August) I was the research and design lead for the VA.

### Who are the people and teams you work most closely with?

I’m building up my internal team, so the team that is part of the CTO office. But a lot of my work is external facing, so VHA, MHV, the office of connected care, OIT – mobile aps portfolio. OEHRM, office of community care, (one more I missed).

### How were you involved with the vets.gov to va.gov transition, as it pertains to the logged in homepage/myVA experience?

I worked with Samara on the Dragons team when we were first putting together the idea of account/dashboard/profile, so I was on the personalization team for a little while. Then I stepped into the design lead role, I was involved in the overall shift to VA.gov with some of the stakeholder organization, making sure teams had research resources, getting all the user research in place for that switch over.

### Can you tell me about stakeholder organization and how you managed and organized them on such a big project?

We worked with Chris Johnston takes an attitude of bringing them along for the ride. There is the rule of 7 — if you repeat things enough, they start spouting your own ideas back to you as gospel. That was the huge part of the strategy. When we got the digital modernization signed and bought in by leadership, it said a lot of things “vets should have a single point of entry/source of truth” etc. We got enough leadership to buy in to that memo. Andy/Jeff B/Chris pulled together a team that they did weekly meetings with where they showed them mockups or asked them what problems they think they should solve and sharing research with them.

### What problems have you noticed about the current logged in homepage and myVA experiences?

It’s a good V1. We wanted… VA’s sources of data on veterans are less ideal than one might have hoped. When we were originally thinking about what a dashboard would be, we were thinking of a blue sky and having so much more info on a veteran. When we started, we realized we didn’t even have their address as a source of truth. So, having sources of truth on veterans. Tapping into APIs and getting statuses. When we started, we had that or prescriptions and messages, but not for other things. 

For new VA.gov, you’re presented with all of the things, and it’s currently what we have about you. There’s a very sparse personalized homepage now as opposed to the very robust unauthenticated homepage.

### What would your ideal homepage look like?

We’ve been really pushing with a lot of offices across VA — the idea that you’re a veteran, you’re a human being, and your health starts at the kitchen table. VA has a number of silo’d applications that it has built for veterans, and this pandemic has really brought to light that if we did this thoughtfully, we could use those in concert to deliver a really thoughtful experience to veterans. How do we get them into the right level of care? You don’t need to have an in-person appointment if you just want to get your prescriptions renewed. But veterans don’t know that. 

So I see a logged in dashboard as a way of doing triage. I’m trying to do something and get questions answered by what you know about me, and manage the care that I have. It brings together your education, disability, health, memorial benefits. If you’re going for a C&P exam and seeing your primary care doctor, those are probably happening in the same place, so why not show them in the same place? 

So it brings together triage and management of care and makes veterans engaged agents in that. And it might bring more digital solutions. Eg. Telehealth — veterans are open to this I they know it exists, but they want their doctor to tell them about it, not learning about it through a random email. 

### Is telehealth something we provide now?

Yes.

### What health tools would you want to see on a dashboard?

Just in a general sense of who you are as a veteran, knowing what facilities you are registered at, if you could get as granular as the care team… having or not having an active care team is a barrier to accessing care at the VA, and that is not a transparent piece of information. You can message your primary care team and interact with them through telehealth. VA is working on same-day urgent care through telehealth or phone. 

The core base things: 

- Facilities
- Care team
- Your appointments (community care, urgent care, telehealth)
- Messages
- Prescriptions (renew/refill)
- Results/Labs/Tests/Images
- EHR has a thing called a clipboard. So if you have to go in for an appointment, (filling out forms for them).
- Digital therapeutics — so VA gives veterans iPads or blood pressure cuffs, so a way to track your data. So that’s an area.
- There is energy right now around health bots.
- There are text-based applications so you can enroll protocols and text with your doctor.
- There are mobile applications — kidney, mental health, etc. If you were prescribed to use those, that would be a place you could potentially see those things.

Unfortunately, in the meantime, I have to prepare for your dashboard to be a place to send you to the right portal as the VA is using Cerner. So that means if you are a veteran who gets care I multiple places, we can say “hey if you are looking to your provider in Spokane, you can go here. Pensacola, go here” And they have to go to two different portals to do things.

### What about if MHV didn’t exist?

Whether MHV exists or not… if it does exist, it wouldn’t be terribly dissimilar to how it is now (where we show you a preview). However, if it doesn’t exist, we show you those things on VA.gov. 

### How would an update to the logged in homepage experience impact your work?

Positively. We have been trying to advocate for not going with the Cerner portal. It’s completely divorced from the rest of your VA experience. It’s just this isolated island that doesn’t look or feel like VA. So part of our strategy is that you all bought into this digital modernization vision of veterans being able to do things in one place, so this would help me deliver on that strategy.

### What are your goals for a new logged in homepage experience?

We can go very blue sky, but as far as I am concerned, about bringing things together… VA.gov brought things together and set a standard… I think we could set a similar standard for VA for how they think about launching a new product. So if you are thinking about launching a new product, by surfacing it on an authenticated dashboard and surfacing it only to the people who should see it… you’re in the VA system and not off in silos building a new thing. 

I think the other thing would be the opportunity to change some behavior. As more and more sites are brand-consolidating in, eBenefits being a huge one, we can change veteran behavior. They are not used to getting things in one place. Training veterans to look at their dashboard first as “how I navigate the VA” and that they don’t necessarily need to call/go in person. 

### What does success look like to you? How would you know this project has succeeded?

If we notice that veterans are starting to use this — they are logged in and are starting to recognize that VA.gov is where I start. Right now they still start on MHV/eBenefits. Even if they have to go out to other sites for a little while, OK, but if veterans are going to VA.gov and logging in and doing all these other things, and that’s what we see in data funnels and hear in sentiments, then that would be a huge effect.

### What metrics would you be interested in seeing around a logged in homepage?

(Other than sentiment or data funnel?) Probably, but I can’t think of anything.

### What logged in homepage/dashboard experiences have you come across that work well, and not so well? How about notifications?

USAA — what I do like about that is that it’s pretty adaptable. I can say what I want at the top of my screen. I can completely customize it. It’s all there. I can decide where things go/don’t go so it’s not overwhelming to me. I like that. Probably the best example because it serves a lot different needs.

Peloton 

### What might make this project easier or harder in any specific ways, as it relates to your role on va.gov, or your team?

Easier for y’all — you have regular touch points and access to different teams that are building things, and some sort of staying aware of (what teams are building). Anything that is sort of your team integrating into other teams to get that intel to figure out what needs to go on the dashboard and how.

Some sort of IA help would be helpful — do things live in the same place in the auth world as the unauth world?

I think every team wants their thing at the top of the page, but this has to serve users first, both from decluttering to how to build it in such a way that it’s responsive to the specific needs of a specific user. So, if someone wants to see their appointments at the top of the dashboard, then… (missed some of this) So figuring out how to make it adaptive (and missed this as well). 

### What concerns do you have about this project? What do you imagine going wrong?

Most of my other concerns are… I want to make sure this gets done. I know this team has to deal with all things authenticated gets a lot putting on them last minute. So my concern is that we start this effort and that something else gets dumped on this team and it doesn’t get done.

### Is there anyone else you think we should talk to?

It might be interesting to get the perspective of Kathy F. She has a vision for what a patient portal is, and I share a lot of the same theories. She could be really interesting to talk to as a stakeholder.

When Patrick Bateman comes back, he’ll be doing product stuff on the health team. Mike Chelen is doing backend stuff. Martha is doing a lot of research on portals and solutions, so she might have some good ideas.
