# Logged-in Homepage Stakeholder Interviews Research Summary 

**Digital Services Veterans Affairs (DSVA), VSA, Authenticated Experience**<br>

Liz Lantz (liz@adhocteam.us), 04/20/2020

## Research Goals 

As part of a larger discovery effort for the new logged-in homepage, we wanted to talk to DEPO stakeholders in order to:

- Better understand problems and pinpoints stakeholders perceive with the current logged-in homepage and My VA
- Gain insight to their goals and ideas around success for a new logged in homepage experience
- Understand the impact of this work to other teams
- Better understand risks
- Expand our thinking and gain insights into what we don't know yet

## Research Methodology 

We conducted remote 1:1 interviews  via Zoom between March 30 - April 17, 2020. A moderator began with introduction questions and prompted stakeholders with questions (from the conversation guide). Remote observers and note takers were also in attendance for some sessions.

### Who we talked to

**Round 1**

- Chris Johnston
- Lauren Alexanderson
- Samara Strauss
- Clarice Chan
- Steve Kovacs
- Andrea Schneider
- Matt Self
- Ryan Thurlwell
- Mel Woodard
- Kevin Hoffman
- Mikki Northius
- Dave Conlon
- Andy Lewandowski

**Round 2**

- Charles Worthington
- Jen Lee
- John Hashimoto

### Research Questions

- What problems have stakeholders noticed about the current logged-in homepage and My VA experience?
- How would an update to these parts of VA.gov impact their work?
- What goals do stakeholders have for a new logged-in homepage experience?
- How do stakeholders define success? What metrics are they interested in seeing?
- What risks do stakeholders anticipate for this work? What concerns do they have?

## Key Findings

### Perceived problems with the current UX 

1. The homepage and navigation largely stay the same when people log in, which gives little sense of personalization and doesn't effectively present what we know about Veterans.
2. We're not effectively guiding Veterans to tasks and tools from the logged-in homepage or via the navigation.
3. We're not effectively providing updates or notifications to Veterans through VA.gov.

### Stakeholder goals

1. A Veteran's logged-in homepage should be a data driven experience that reflects what we know about them.
2. The logged-in homepage should guide Veterans in a meaningful way that helps them complete tasks.
3. We should provide a logged-in experience that scales visually and across use cases.

### Impacts to work and DEPO teams

1. Teams can leverage the homepage to elevate tools.
2. A new logged-in experience may influence how and what people build for Veterans outside the homepage.

### Perceived project risks

1. Having many stakeholders could prevent us from delivering incremental improvements in a timely way.
2. The logged-in homepage could become a dumping ground.
3. We could create/increase Veteran mistrust through poor data integrity and login experiences.
4. COVID-19 disruptions could impact ability to effectively interact with stakeholders.

## Details of Findings

### Perceived problems with the current UX 

1. **The homepage and navigation largely stay the same when people log in, which gives little sense of personalization and doesn't effectively present what we know about Veterans.**

   We are falling short in providing a more targeted experience that reflects Veterans' circumstances and needs, guides them to tasks and tools, and makes them feel welcome. Without a more tailored authenticated experience, Veterans don't have enough incentive to log in.

2. **We're not effectively guiding Veterans to tasks and tools from the logged-in homepage or via the navigation.**

   Stakeholders feel Veterans rely on the Top Tasks on the VA.gov homepage to get to the tasks and tools they're looking for, rather than going to My VA or using the main navigation.  One stakeholder described it as a "greek diner" approach to the navigation menu — it contains ALL the items which requires significant cognitive load to sort through and find the task they actually came to complete. 

   While My VA does elevate personal information, it's not used very frequently (we learned this in [our Personalization 2.0 research study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/personalization%202.0/discovery-research#observations-the-my-va-dashboard)), and the visual experience hasn't scaled in such a way that it helps Veterans find what they're looking for quickly. We can do better than presenting a stacked list that requires significant mental processing and scrolling to understand all that is available.

3. **We're not effectively providing updates or notifications to Veterans through VA.gov**.

   Veterans have to seek out updates because they don't see them immediately upon logging in.  We're missing the opportunity to help Veterans with task completion  and understanding their status and next steps by not having a centralized place for them to find these notifications.

### Stakeholder goals

1. **A Veteran's logged-in homepage should be a data driven experience that reflects what we know about them.**

   By leveraging the data we have for each Veteran profile, we'll be able to surface the most relevant information related to benefits, claims, and preferred VA facilities to each individual. We can build Veteran trust by providing information and updates that reflect their specific situation, and empowering them to complete tasks quickly and efficiently.

2. **The logged-in homepage should guide Veterans in a meaningful way that helps them complete tasks.**

   Stakeholders want to see a task-based UX for the logged-in homepage, to help Veterans achieve their goals quickly and efficiently, while providing continued access to the things that are most important. This will hopefully contribute to people relying less on call centers, submitting manual forms, or having to go in-person to complete tasks.

3. **We should provide a logged-in experience that scales visually and across use cases.**

   As VA.gov continues to grow, we'll need to establish a logged-in experience that can grow with it.  The logged-in homepage needs to be a place users can easily and efficiently find what they're looking for, whether that's 2 or 20 tasks, and if they are new Veteran or if they've been using the VA for decades.

### Impacts to work and DEPO teams

1. **Teams can leverage the homepage to elevate tools.**

   Stakeholders can use the homepage as a place to elevate valuable tools, status updates, and alerts that Veterans need.

2. **A new logged-in experience may influence how and what people build for Veterans outside the homepage.**

   Having a centralized place that makes it easy to see relevant tools will also inform our DEPO teams and other business lines about what's out there, and may influence what they're working on.  APIs may also be impacted, since we may want to get data we don’t have now for homepage, and we'll need to ingest that data in a consistent way.

### Perceived project risks

1. **Having many stakeholders could prevent us from delivering incremental improvements in a timely way.**

   Almost every stakeholder mentioned concerns around navigating many opinions, containingScope scope, and competing priorities.  These are valid concerns. Having a clear solution vision for this work, staying focused on our North Star objectives, and open communication with teams will be critical to mitigating this risk.

2. **The logged-in homepage could become a dumping ground.**

   The logged-in homepage is valuable real estate for reaching Veterans, and stakeholders commented throughout interviews that every team/business line will want their tools featured there. We can keep this space decluttered and useful to Veterans with data-informed decision making about what Veterans see on their homepage.

3. **We could create/increase Veteran mistrust through poor data integrity and login experiences.**

   Data integrity will become even more critical to maintaining and building Veteran trust as we increase personalization to enhance the logged in experience.  We'll need to carefully consider the data we have available to us as we build our roadmap, perhaps holding off on some features longer than others, until we are confident we can present Veterans with an experience they can trust.

4. **COVID-19 disruptions could impact ability to effectively interact with stakeholders.**

   At the time of writing, all team members are working remotely, which inherently has more limitations than being in-person.   The timeline has already been extended due to COVID-19 impacts on work schedules.  We're not sure how long this will go on, and will need to be persistent and creative to try to match the productivity we could have with this work if we were not in the midst of a global pandemic.



## Additional Insights

### **Metrics**

It will be important to look at metrics before and after the launch of a new logged-in homepage to understand the impact of this work. Two common themes emerged when stakeholders were asked what metrics they'd be interested in seeing for this effort.

1. **Measuring interactions can help us understand if we are guiding Veterans in a meaningful way that  helps them complete tasks.**  Metrics to look at could be:
   - Navigation path from logged-in homepage, especially as it relates to online tools 
   - Interactions with logged-in homepage
   - Use of self-service tools
   - Whether the volume of calls to call centers changes as a result of the new logged-in homepage
   - Whether the number of tasks completed by mail or in-person changes as a result of the new logged-in homepage

2. **Measuring authenticated sessions will give insights into how Veterans perceive the value we're providing through a personalized, data-driven experience.**  Metrics to look at could be:
   - User satisfaction
   - Number of people who verify their identity (LOA3)
   - Time to log in
   - Count of sessions where a user is logged in
   - Count of individuals logging in

### **Comparative experiences**

Conversations with stakeholders validated that banking and financial sites serve as valuable models for VA.gov. When done well, financial and banking sites provide a level of personalization that create a strong differentiation from the logged-out experience. They allow users to complete a number of transactions, including submitting applications, viewing account statuses and updates, and receiving notifications. They also keep marketing content separate from the logged-in experience.

Companies mentioned that we'll aim to look at (account availability may create a blocker):

- Bank of America
- USAA
- Chase
- Fidelity Bank

Multiple stakeholders also named companies who offer personalized experiences that impact users both online and offline, or across multiple products such as Google, Delta, and Apple.  Insurance companies, such as State Farm or Geico also came up as something to consider, as they also provide users the ability to apply, file a claim, check status, and manage their benefits.

## Considerations and action items

### Things to think about

- We'll want to work closely with VSP to audit the design system and build-up/scale it to accommodate the authenticated tools. This redesign is a good opportunity to explore.
- We should think more broadly about how to guide Veterans in the logged-in experience — how does a logged-in navigation factor into this project?
- Establishing a concrete solution vision and building out our roadmap early on will help us manage stakeholder expectations.

### Action items

- Samara Strauss (current PO of Authenticated Experience team) should regroup with DEPO stakeholders on how to involve VA stakeholders in this project
- We'll include Bank of America, USAA, Chase, Fidelity, Google, Apple, Delta, State Farm and Geico in our comparative analysis.
- We'll continue with remaining research activities planned for this discovery effort: 
  - Past research review ([Issue #7265](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/7265))
  - Analytics review ([Issue #7772](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/7772))
  - User interviews ([Epic #7268](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/7268))
  - Comparative analysis ([Issue #7266](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/7266))
