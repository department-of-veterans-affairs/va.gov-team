# Stakeholder interview with Ryan Thurlwell 4.1.20 & 4.3.20

### Tell me about your role and what you do in your work on va.gov

I am one of the oddballs on our DEPO team that has no very-strict role. I’m a designer. In the USDS directive is to “go where the work is” and fix things we think are problematic, so what that empowers us to do is have freedom and hop on to a lot of things. There are other folks that have taken on specific work, where Martha and I have always been “design spackle” where there has been need on a team for a thing, so we scrub in and do that.

There are kind of two main funnels for how work exists at the VA — the one funnel is the VA business needs. They come to us with a solution, and we usually say “let’s figure out what the actual problem is.” The other part of the work is work that we — DEPO — where we kind of… so VA.gov — maybe 2 years ago at this point — that was a different website, and one day everyone agreed (to make it a new website).

(Talking about how Ryan, Jen, Andy worked together) Together as a design team, would spin up a V001 — here is kind of a first draft that captures a vision so everyone can look at the same artifact and say “this is where we’re headed” and then iterate on that thing. So “Pittsburgh” spun up that way. It kind of just put everything in motion

### How long have you been in this role?

### Who are the people and teams you work most closely with?

### How were you involved with the vets.gov to va.gov transition, as it pertains to the logged in homepage/myVA experience?

Was not involved. Andy, Lauren, and Chris will be able to tell you a lot about that.

### What problems have you noticed about the current logged in homepage and myVA experiences?

The common mental model of a logged in experience are derived from banks, where if you go to a bank’s website it’s just a bunch of products. Which is what VA.gov is, it’s just a bunch of products. But if you go to your bank, you can get to a bunch of product things, like Bank of America which bought Merrill Lynch, so you can toggle between them (and different services). So that’s the ideal. You log into a thing and it’s a customized, tailored experience for you. I know from history from talking to Samara a while ago that the profile was basically just an unordered list. The VA is such a monolythic organization and everything I silo’d. Geteting notifications to talk to each other (is hard) and everything is kind of hidden. The VA has room for improvement to change how the VA communicates. People should have confidence the VA knows who they are. It’s service design. (Ryan talked about how everything should be connected).

(Talked about VAMC experience and the “people in the red vests”) The signage was so clear, but they don’t use words th same way all the time. VAMCs used one term and VA.gov used another.

[Back to the homepage] So it’s a consistent experience, it’s branding, it’s integrated.

MHV — schedule an appointment, refill a prescription, download your medical records, and two others. So those 5 are the big tasks. Most veterans know MHV more than VA.gov.

VAOS is a good example — it was a tool you had to sign into separately. It’s taken us a year, but we’ve finally brought it onto VA.gov. And with all this integration stuff right now, you can go to Pittsburgh (the site) and you can hit “schedule an appointment” and you don’t have to go anywhere else.

[Back to the homepage] So for a signed in user, we know you’re enrolled in this and not enrolled in this.

### How would an update to the logged in homepage experience impact your work?
It would impact my work in the sense that I would love to design it.  (Talked about how chaotic things are with so many teams, but feels things will get more organized as they move forward).  Our main goal is to enable folks like you [contractos] to do the things that you do.  I would imagine the authenticated experience would come from DEPO as a collective. We'll figure that out as we go. 

### Kevin Hoffman brought up the the design system and how it leans very much toward the unauthenticated experience. I know you work on the design system; what impacts do you see to your work in that regard?  (need to review recording)
How do we make this the first thing that we do? How do we make the components available early so people can start using them and we can learn from them?

### What are your goals for a new logged in homepage experience?

### What does success look like to you? How would you know this project has succeeded?

What metrics would you be interested in seeing around a logged in homepage?

### What logged in homepage/dashboard experiences have you come across that work well, and not so well? How about notifications?

### What might make this project easier or harder in any specific ways, as it relates to your role on va.gov, or your team?

### What are concerns do you have about this project? What do you imagine going wrong?

### Is there anyone else you think we should talk to?

### Can you show me some of your designs and talk about why you made some of those decisions?

[On designs he already did with Andy] Andy would have these epiphanies and just put stuff on a whiteboard and we would just start something.

[Shares screen/design] This was our first, bare bones, IDEO-style of what a logged in homepage would look like. We just bucketed… we just prioritized this… when you’re looking at the homepage, you can’t exclude the header. That’s a key piece of the logged in experience. I’ve always found our header (navigation) a bit kludgy (listed some concerns).

[On the actual page] We listed notifications. These should always point you to the product. So you would click (the notification) and go to see your appointments. 

And then we thought oh, instead of trying to section everything off (by benefit), you would just group like-material together.

Then, we took all the top tasks… and this is where I didn’t finish…. Are there notifications here too? This is the banking equivalent of having a checking or savings account.

And then we spilt everything else into “Manage”. So we have a health care bucket, and then we have everything else. So we have top 5 top tasks. This was probably the least thought out section. 

And then all of this is still accessible from a new menu (navigation) where everything gets rapped into these three buckets — Menu, Search, Locations — and then Sign In. For search, we could search right here (in line) and load results right here.

Then, I would imagine we’d have the VA locator tool and it would load your saved locations. 

And then I always envisioned the Sign-In menu to be the same thing. If you’re not logged in and you drill into something and sign in, the notifications would be here too (in the “Menu” area).

### How would you change your homepage design?

One thing this is doing which is tough to navigate at the VA. Here’s something I can tell you about Vets.gov to VA.gov, we took away their carousel and they were like “How are we going to tell veterans about a new thing?!” So we gave them (promo spots in other areas on the site). SO that’s not taken into account in (my mockups), so I can totally see the business being like “what about this” or “what about this?” I don’t know if the nav needs to change too much.

Also, I don’t know if you’ve seen (the blue sky prototype).
