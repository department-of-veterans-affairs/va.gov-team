# Stakeholder interview with Samara Strauss 

3/30/2020, conducted by Liz Lantz

#### Tell me about your role and what you do in your work on va.gov

Lead for the auth exp team. Primarily manage current my VA dashboard, va.gov profile and account settings pages. We mange any products within those pages - direct deposit, contact info section, have a couple projects outside of those specific pages. That’s primarily what we manage. Going forward, hoping our team will work on notifications and have a much higher level overview of the general auth experience team. And work with other teams that are working on more specific aspects of that.

#### How long have you been in this role?

Has been on this team for a little over 2 years - has been in the role as a product owner for 3-4 months. Not currently doing any design work for the team, but background is in UX.

#### Who are the people and teams you work most closely with?

Other than folks on auth experience team, doesn’t work as closely with others but her role does involve keeping an eye on what other teams are doing and how that might affect us.  Down the line, we’ll want to integrate all of the healthcare stuff on va.gov, so working with Lauren [Alexanderson]. Same with eBenefits. She knows eBenefits has tools they’re integrating at a really fast pace, but we don’t have a place to link to them currently on the logged in homepage.

#### How were you involved with the vets.gov to va.gov transition, as it pertains to the logged in homepage/myVA experience ?

Background behind that was when we were vets.gov, what we’re calling now the myVA dashboard, it was called ”if you were logged in that was your logged in homepage". When this site moved over to va.gov, there was a conversation of what do we do with this page, we’ve got this other homepage [non-logged in], but it only happened only a month or 2 before the site was supposed to launch. 

The work [on the non-logged in] involved a ton of outside stakeholders in that team, tons of user testing.  That homepage had been very vetted, and there wasn’t buy-in for a myVA dashboard.  Preference at the time was consistent to keep the logged-in/logged out as it was.

Tl;dr there was no change to myVA, just co-existed with the logged out homepage. 

#### What problems have you noticed about the current logged in homepage and myVA experiences?

So many

- She did a bunch of [research last summer on personalization 2.0](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/personalization%202.0/discovery-research/README.md) to vet this whole thing, "should we do this?" Answer was YES.  A lot of the stuff is outlined in that research.
- We have a lot of redundancy between those two pages, Technically, myVA existed before the va.gov homepage, between the two, of the top 20 links, 9 are repeated on myVA. Lots of duplication
  They both do things well, but they’re not doing enough
- On my va the visual design didn’t scale well, updated things don’t bubble up to the top, hard to scan
- On the logged in homepage, the page doesn’t tell you anything about you. If you’re logged in and we know you have healthcare, why are we showing you a link to apply if we know you already have it? Why are we showing “check status of GI bill benefits” if we know you don’t have them? It’s not at all personalized to the logged in user.
- Homepage, what it does well is it’s an amazing router. Some people thing it s too good, I don’t really buy into that.
- Working well about myVA - not executing well, but the good thing is that it IS showing you a bunch of your status and updates in one place. The visual design, it’s very much an MVP. But there are things we can learn and take and figure out how to execute better.
  - There were 4 sections to start - your applications, prescriptions, health messaging, claim status, and a couple of other links. 
  - Since then we’ve added the find a va benefits tool, healthcare application status, enrollment status - all things that are good and valuable information but it could’ve been done way better. (Samara worked on this.) Even if it had been done better, the page isn’t set up to show status updates or bubble up to the top and no matter what we wouldn’t have been in a position to put this stuff on a page

#### How would an update to the logged in homepage experience impact your work?

It would make her life so much better.  The big goal for this project

- One is to improve the veteran experience and to give them a landing pad that is more usable and useful
- In terms of her work, as someone who is a PO and continuing to develop the product as a whole, where it really affects her, is that people need to have a place to put their tools
- We need to have something that is going to scale and as tools and features get added, we need to be able to put in a link, and has room to grow. From a higher level, if we can get the profile and logged in homepage in a scalable spot, we can work toward something more data-centric, once we know more about the user, we can use that information to create a better personalized experience.
  
  

#### What are your goals for a new logged in homepage experience?

- Something that will scale well over time, both visually and functionally.
- More usable/better UX
- [Check personalization 2.0 document](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/personalization%202.0/discovery-research/README.md)

#### What does success look like to you? How would you know this project has succeeded?

Usability testing. A combination of usability testing, what behaviors do we see in analytics? People are going to myVA, but is it actually getting people places? Is it some place they come back to, do they see themselves reflected in what they see there?

Would be successful for her if she could scale. As new features come online, I have a place to put them.
The real thing is "are Veterans going to be able to log in here really easily, check the status of something, see something about themselves and complete a task more quickly?"

[Moderator asked if a reduction in call center/help requests be a measure of success] Shante on her team works with the call centers, manages and works with them to get feedback on VA.gov, works as a liaison between them and the call center. They don’t have good insight into call center metrics.

#### What metrics would you be interested in seeing around a logged in homepage?

- What are people doing from here?  
- Are they using this page and clicking these links? 
- Is this is a useful starting point for them on va.gov
- Where do they go from here?
- Are we bale to assess if they’re able to complete what they came here to do?
- Call center data, or something where we could assess are we seeing fewer calls or inquires about this because of their homepage and see it there?

#### What logged in homepage/dashboard experiences have you come across that work well, and not so well? How about notifications?

- I don’t want to it to feel like a news feed - no twitter/facebook-style news feed type thing.  
- Will send more thoughts.
- Being mindful that part of the goal is to show updates. 

#### What might make this project easier or harder in any specific ways, as it relates to your role on va.gov, or your team?

Doesn’t think our team is a big risk factor, although we’re doing these interviews to catch differentiating opinions and see how we can handle that.  If there is evidence of strong opinions and we can show that users prefer a different thing, our team is very trusting of users and let them lead the work. Anything we can back up by user evidence will make conversations easier where there is a difference of opinions
It’s a complex project in general.

#### What concerns do you have about this project? What do you imagine going wrong? 

Not so concerned about there being too many cooks, just because again, anytime you have the word homepage attached, everyone has an opinion and strong feelings. Small concerns are there a going to be so many opinions that it’ll be hard to navigate

[Moderator asked if timeline could be impacted by so many stakeholders]: wouldn’t delay the discovery engagement. Once we get into this project and we start to get into design, it could be a bit more challenging. And we’ll have to figure out how to execute this project in a way where there are some level of check-ins and design reviews, where it doesn’t turn into design by committee.
