## Product questions we're trying to answer

We're broadly trying to figure out how to create a more useful logged in homepage, one that is the most useful blend of dashboard/personal information and links to tools. We want to do a better job than we are now of showing veterans the full picture of their care at the VA in one place, and a better job of helping them complete the tasks they come to VA.gov to complete.

To help us figure this out, we'd like to better understand:

- Why people come to VA.gov.
- What people do on VA.gov
- How people move through the site.
- How people use the homepage.
- How people use My VA.
- Areas for improvement for existing functionality.
- How people's experience with the site might change if we had a proper notification system.

## Questions

### Analytics

#### General

- What are the top ~20  pages visited on VA.gov?
  - How does this change if we look at top pages for logged out users vs. logged in users?
- What are the top ~20 search terms on VA.gov?
- What are the top ~20 entry points for VA.gov?
- After people enter the site, what is the next thing they do?
- % of traffic by device (desktop; tablet; mobile).

#### Homepage

- What page do people visit BEFORE the homepage?
- How often is the homepage people's first entry point?
- What links do people click from the homepage?
- How many people visit the homepage?

#### My VA

- What page do people visit BEFORE My VA?
- Is My VA ever a first entry point?
- What do people do from My VA? (ie. what links do they click?)
- How many people visit My VA? 

### User research/interviews

- Why do people log in to VA.gov?
-	Why do people go to the homepage?
- Why do people go to My VA?
- What makes the logged in homepage useful now? What would make it more useful?
- What makes My VA useful? What would make it more useful than it is now?
- Where do people expect to see/receive notifications? How would notifications be most helpful to people?
- What do they expect to see on a logged in homepage?
- Are people overly reliant on the homepage for navigation because the logged in navigation doesnâ€™t do a good job at elevating tools?
- Why do people come to VA.gov? What do they want to do?
- What is the balance between dashboard vs. router?
- What are the main things people do on VA digital tools/VA.gov? 
- Pain points 
- Do people trust the data they see on VA.gov?

## Hypotheses to test

### Homepage

- People will want to see update information, but not at the expense or ease of scanning/navigating to tools.
- How people use the homepage will change based on whether we tailor the authenticated navigation to be more tool-oriented.

### Notifications

- People expect to email notifications will take them directly into whatever tool they are accessing and not to the homepage. However, if people have notification emails turned off, they would want to see timely information on their dashboard.
