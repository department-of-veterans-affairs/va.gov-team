# Nametag Use Cases
**Last updated - February 14, 2024 - published**

The nametag will appear for users when:

    If someone is LOA3 (identity verified), except when there are MPI errors or legal name endpoint does not load (use cases listed below).
    If someone is LOA3 but the Profile is blocked (fiduciary flag/marked as incompetent/deceased).

The nametag will not appear if:

    If someone is LOA1 (not identity verified).
    Legal/full name endpoint does not load.
    Profile encounters MPI errors.
