## Overview 
From our [research this year ](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/Research/2023-06-add-dependents-records-discovery/summary.md)we've noticed a trend of users searching for Letters and Dependents from the profile (and across the broader va.gov website). 

We're looking for a low stakes, low development way to reduce the number of users searching for letters and dependents from the profile and across the broader VA.gov site. Adding Letters and Dependents to the "personalized menu" is potentially a great way to do exactly that.

## Important Artifacts 

- Epic
- Analytics Dashboard
- ~~QA Testing~~
- ~~UAT Testing~~
  

## Phase I - UAT 

We're not running UAT for this initiative, we're going to [use metrics to monitor and ensure success.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/authenticated-menu/add-dependents-letter#measuring-success)


## Phase II - Staged Rollout 

### Rollback Plan:
PM and PO will monitor analytics. If the team notices a spike in errors, they will contact the engineering team to get the FE engineer to disable the toggles previously mentioned. 

### Planning
**Launch Go/No-go:** 
- [Launch go/no-go conversation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/64424)

**Desired date range:** _TBD_
- [Launch Ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/64430) 

**What metrics-based criteria will you look at before advancing rollout to the next stage?:**

## Post-launch Questions 

_To be completed once you have gathered your initial set of data, as outlined above._ 

1. How do the KPIs you gathered compare to your pre-launch definition(s) of "success"?
2. What qualitative feedback have you gathered from users or other stakeholders, if any?
3. Which of the assumptions you listed in your product outline were/were not validated? 
4. How might your product evolve now or in the future based on these results?
