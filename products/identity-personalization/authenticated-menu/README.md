### Communications

- **Github labels**: authenticated-experience
- **Slack channel**: [#accountexp-authexp](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/accountexp-authexp)

### Roles

#### OCTO team

[This is managed by the VA.gov profile team](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/README.md#roles).


## Overview
When logged in, a menu labeled with the user's name appears in the upper-right corner of the screen. This authenticated menu links to three personalized spaces -- My VA, the VA.gov profile, and the MHV landing page. In the 5+ years this menu has been live on VA.gov, we've done very little in the way of exploring how it could better support users.

## User problem statement

VA.gov has historically prioritized the unauthenticated experience in its navigation. As a result, users tend to be overly reliant on the homepage and My VA for navigating to personalized tools.

## User Outcomes

### Desired User Outcomes

*Why would a user want to use this? With this problem solved, what should users be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*

- Users would want to use the authenticated menu to more easily find authenticated tools and information without having to sift through content pages.

### Undesired User Outcomes

- Done wrong, the authenticated menu could become a noisy, cluttered place that makes it harder for users to easily navigate to authenticated tools.

## Business Outcomes

### Desired Business Outcomes

*Why would your business want this to exist? With this problem solved, what should your business be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*

- Done right, the authenticated menu could be an important part of a more holistic authenticated experience. 

### Undesired Business Outcomes

- The authenticated menu becomes a disorganized dumping ground.
