# Direct deposit: Blocking updates if someone has a fiduciary/incompetent/deceased flag

**Last updated:** November 29, 2022

Previously, we did not allow people who have a fiduciary/are incompetent/are marked as deceased to access and update the direct deposit section of the VA.gov profile.  They could access other parts of the profile.

As of November 2022, we have updated profile so people with these flags only have access to the acccount security section of profile.
