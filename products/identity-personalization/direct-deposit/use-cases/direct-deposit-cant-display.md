# Direct deposit: We can't display any direct deposit information

**Last updated May 3, 2022**

If for some reason we can't display any direct deposit information, we show an warning alert on the direct deposit page in profile. There's no action a user can take to correct this.

## UX
- Uses the [warning alert component](https://design.va.gov/components/alert#warning-alert) from the VA design system.
- Review the [mock-up available in Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/s/1a920e73-1dcb-47c4-aae8-08656756c131/a/rbaOjaq) for a visual.
