 [Project Outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/direct-deposit/evss-lighthouse-migration#readme)

## Table of contents


## Step 1: Development

| Toggle name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| profile_lighthouse_direct_deposit | When enabled, will request direct deposit data from lighthouse API. |

## Step 2: Validation

We've tracked GH tickets/issues and information related to the direct deposit migration in [EPIC | Profile | Direct Deposit C&P Migration from EVSS to Lighthouse #51900](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/51900).

#### [**QA Artifact Summary**](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/direct-deposit/evss-lighthouse-migration/QA/README.md)

Our testing plan was finalized through [PM | Direct deposit EVSS > Lighthouse migration: QA prep & planning #54870](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/54870)
Use cases and testing are documented on [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xflLNJhUSVslzLbVQtMkYkzsBGAhIccnmYW0GL_Ihd0/edit#gid=0).  


#### Privacy, Security, Infrastructure Review


## Step 3: Production rollout

### Define the Rollback process

**Rollback Plan:**

PM and PO will monitor analytics (specifics to be documented with story [#61165](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/61165)). If the team notices a spike in errors, they will contact the engineering team to get the FE engineer to disable the toggle.profile_lighthouse_direct_deposit

### Phase I: moderated production testing (also known as User Acceptance Testing, or UAT)

- How will you make the product available in production while limiting the number of users who can find/access it: We'll enable the toggle for a % of users
- What metrics-based criteria will you look at before advancing rollout to the next stage ("success criteria")?: \[use your KPIs to help guide this. It could be things like *abandonment rate < 20%*, *reported contact center calls < 2 calls*, *error rate < 5%*, etc.\]

## Post-launch Questions

*To be completed once you have gathered your initial set of data, as outlined above.*

1. How do the KPIs you gathered compare to your pre-launch definition(s) of "success"?
1. What qualitative feedback have you gathered from users or other stakeholders?
1. Which assumptions you listed in your product outline were/were not validated?
1. How might your product evolve now or in the future based on these results?
1. What technical tasks are needed to clean up (i.e., removal of feature toggles)?
