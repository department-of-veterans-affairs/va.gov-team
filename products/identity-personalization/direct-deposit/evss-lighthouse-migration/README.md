## Overview

EVSS -- the VA backend that stores direct deposit for comp & pen, disability ratings, and more -- is being retired in favor of the Lighthouse platform. Lighthouse has been working hard to migrate data from EVSS to their platform, and they have successfully done so with direct deposit for comp & pen information. This means that we need to reintegrate the VA.gov profile to point to Lighthouse instead of EVSS.

## Problem Statement

As a person that receives payments from VA, I want to be able to easily view and update my direct deposit information.

## Goals

- Migrate from EVSS to Lighthouse without any disruptions in service for veterans and other users.
- See improvements in direct deposit save success rates, which are only about 90% currently.

## User outcomes

### Desired User Outcomes

- Users see no interruptions in service or issues with updating their direct deposit for comp & pen info as this migration happens.

### Undesired User Outcomes

- Users have additional issues or blockers in updating their direct deposit for comp & pen information.

## Business outcomes

### Desired Business Outcomes

- Direct deposit works seamlessly with no interruption.
- We are one step closer to retiring EVSS.

### Undesired Business Outcomes

- There are disruptions or issues as a result of the migration from EVSS > Lighthouse.

## Measuring success

**Objective 1: Improve save success rates by migrating to Lighthouse**.
