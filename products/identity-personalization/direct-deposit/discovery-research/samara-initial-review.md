## Notes

- Direct deposit is set up on eBenefits for disability compensation, pension, and post-9/11 GI benefits.
- It looks like you can have different bank accounts for comp & pen and the GI bill, but need to confirm.
- Education Form 22-1995 has a section to update direct deposit information, but it doesn't look like there is otherwise a way to update that information on VA.gov right now.

### Fields needed to update banking info

- Account Type
- Bank Routing Number
- Confirm Bank Routing Number 
- Bank Account Number
- Confirm Bank Account Number

## Questions

1. Are there any benefits besides disability compensation, pension, and post-9/11 GI benefits to which someone could set up direct deposit?
2. What backend systems does this info connect to? Does VA.gov have access to these systems right now?
3. Does the direct deposit info in Education form 22-1995 update eBenefits?
4. Where is direct deposit on the Vet360 road map?
5. Can we sync the direct deposit data on eBenefits with VA.gov?
6. Where is direct deposit data stored?
