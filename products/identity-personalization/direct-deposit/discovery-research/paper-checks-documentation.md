### Paper checks discovery correspondence, 4/22 – 4/24

All info via correspondence with Frank Bryceland/Sarah Haddock/Adam Kinder/Melissa Rebstock

- Paper checks are issued for VA compensation. According to Sarah Haddock, there are 100,000+ paper checks still issued by the VA every month.
- People can switch between paper checks and direct deposit, but the exact mechanism for switching back and forth is currently unclear since this is not managed by eBenefits.
- According to Camille Tello, it is OK for people to switch from paper check to direct deposit, but we should discourage and not make clear a mechanism to go back to paper checks if someone already has direct deposit.
- According to Adam Kinder:
  - People get signed up for direct deposit via the disability application process. If they want to opt-in to paper checks, they have to go through the Department of Treasury to do so. According to Adam:
  > The Department of Treasury requires all Federal benefit payments be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), also called direct deposit. Please attach a voided personal check or deposit slip or provide the information requested below in Items 30, 31 and 32 to enroll in direct deposit. If you do not have a bank account, you must receive your payment through Direct Express Debit MasterCard. To request a Direct Express Debit MasterCard you must apply at www.usdirectexpress.com
or by telephone at 1-800-333-1795. If you elect not to enroll, you must contact representatives handling waiver requests for the Department of Treasury at 1-888-224-2950. They will encourage your participation in EFT and address any questions or concerns you may have. That’s what our application says- but we don’t enforce. VSRs would process a paper check if the Veteran requests.  
  - To change an address for a paper check or to cancel direct deposit, someone has to [fill out this form](https://vbaw.vba.va.gov/bl/20/cio/20s5/forms/VBA-20-572-ARE.pdf) and mail it to their regional/intake office.
  - If people get paper checks and then want to opt in to direct deposit, they have to fill out this form](https://vbaw.vba.va.gov/bl/20/cio/20s5/forms/VBA-24-0296-ARE.pdf) and mail it to their regional/intake office. **They can not just go on to eBenefits and add direct deposit information. This will not cancel their paper check.**
  - People who receive paper checks from the VA should call 1-800-827-1000 OR go to a VA regional office to manage that account.
