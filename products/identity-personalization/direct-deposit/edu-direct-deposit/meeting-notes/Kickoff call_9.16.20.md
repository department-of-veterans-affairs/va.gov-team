# Direct deposit for education | Kickoff Call | 9.16.20

- Luke Tickner runs the client applications team. They work on external facing content I think for edu benefits.

- Tammy is the point person for benefits.va.gov website. 

- They’ve also got a group working on education content and forms on VA.gov.

- Lihan has already done the work to audit BGS services. The services are for Chapter 33 benefits.

- When people update on the eBenefits side, is that for all Edu or just Post 9/11 GI bill?
  - Luke: We just went through this for STEM application, which is an extension for Post 9/11 Chapter 33 benefits. When they do this, it asks if they want to update their DD info.
  - If they update their DD info for STEM, it actually updates their info for C&P direct deposit, not Edu direct deposit. So, we’ve got some odd stuff on our end. 
  - For Chapter 33: We pay the school, and we pay the veteran the housing.  
  - For other benefits: We pay the veteran directly.

So basically there is a split in how they pay the veteran.

- Steve: What is not obvious from looking at eBenefits? If we migrate the feature as-is, that will cover all the known use cases for updating direct deposit online?
  - Luke: As far as I know, yes. We’ve got the work study program where we pay veterans directly. Tammy, do they do anything through eBenefits for work study? I think that’s separate entirely. This may be paper applications they (the VA) enters into the system.

- Steve: Any problems with the current eBenefits integration?
  - Luke: No issues around direct deposit. Typically when we hear nothing, it means there’s no issues. If people weren’t getting their payments, we’d hear about it immediately.

- Steve: Any concerns about migrating this feature?
  - Luke: Nope, we’ve worked a lot with VA.gov/Matt Self and we’re familiar with this process.
