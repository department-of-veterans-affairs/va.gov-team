## When to show the direct deposit section

Currently, we are only showing the direct deposit section if someone is eligible for comp & pen payments. Going forward, we need to show the direct deposit section if someone is eligible for comp & pen **or** education payments. There may be scenarios where someone is eligible for both, and there may be scenarios where someone is eligible for only one type of payment.

## Overall page structure

[Direct deposit screens](https://xd.adobe.com/view/532272b2-b423-4e1b-a8c6-d1a583da3d37-0671/)

The current page has two sections:

- Disability compensation and pension benefits
- Education benefits

Going forward, we are pulling out the payments section (the payments section covers all payment types), so there will now be three sections:

- Disability compensation and pension benefits
- Education benefits
- VA payment history

### Edit state

You'll notice the direct deposit section for edu looks exactly like the one for comp & pen. They're basically the same, minus the connection to different backend endpoints, of course.

#### Read-only state

*Specs*

The read-only state is structured the same as the comp & pen section, and it functions the same as the comp & pen section.

*Copy*

All read only copy is the same as the comp & pen module except:

- **Section title**: Education benefit

#### Edit state 

[Direct deposit for edu edit state](https://xd.adobe.com/view/532272b2-b423-4e1b-a8c6-d1a583da3d37-0671/screen/59f1a007-7073-476a-a0e5-9d9df06c3059)

*Specs*

The edit state is structured the same as the comp & pen section, and it functions the same as the comp & pen section. **This includes all frontend validation.** When it doubt, apply the same validation that we have for the comp & pen module for the edu module. [The mockups show the required state](https://xd.adobe.com/view/532272b2-b423-4e1b-a8c6-d1a583da3d37-0671/screen/ab5e191e-7c12-4ed8-90f9-1c967365fe1d) but they don't outline every validation use case. If there's something you have questions about, let's regroup on what to apply.

*Copy*

This is all the same as the comp & pen module **except** for the following fields that Peggy has suggested we update (ticket for updating comp & pen copy to match is [#16470](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vft-59c95ae5fda7577a9b3184f8/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/16470)):

- **Field labels**
  - Routing number (Your bank’s name will appear after you add the 9-digit routing number)
  - Account number (This should be no more than 17 digits)
  
#### Add state

[Direct deposit for edu add state](https://xd.adobe.com/view/532272b2-b423-4e1b-a8c6-d1a583da3d37-0671/screen/51b79b7f-f94e-4edd-85ee-642deb647e6f)

*Specs*

This also functions the exact same way the comp & pen module does: If someone is eligible for edu payments but has not yet set up their bank information, they should see a link to add direct deposit info.

*Copy*

This is the same as the add state for the comp & pen module:

- Please add your bank information

#### Save state

[Direct deposit for edu save state](https://xd.adobe.com/view/532272b2-b423-4e1b-a8c6-d1a583da3d37-0671/screen/5c80aa6a-f3f2-4e0b-afd8-36d88ba3fa98)

*Copy*

Per Peggy, we are changing the save state copy (ticket for updating comp & pen copy to match is [#16470](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vft-59c95ae5fda7577a9b3184f8/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/16470)):

- We’ve updated your bank account information for your **education benefits**

## VA payment history specs

We are separating out the payment history link from the comp & pen module because the payment history tool covers all payment types.

*Copy*

- Still pending Peggy's approval.

## When someone has one type of direct deposit but not the other

Now that we have two types of direct deposit in the profile, we have a scenario that we did not have before: someone may be eligible for one type of direct deposit but not the other. As mentioned above, we will show the direct deposit section in the profile as long as someone is eligible for at least **one** type of direct deposit. This is how we'll handle those use cases.

- We should always show the edu module even if someone is not eligible for it. If someone is not eligible for it, we will have messaging that explains this.
