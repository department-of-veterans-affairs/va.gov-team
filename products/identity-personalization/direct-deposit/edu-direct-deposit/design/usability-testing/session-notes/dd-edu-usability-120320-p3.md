## Participant 3

### Intro
- OK, now that I'm recording, do I have your permission to record this session? Yes. 

### Warm-up
- Would you tell us a little bit about yourself?  I am a veteran, I was in the army joined in 2006, traveled overseas, deployed, and came back and got out. 
- Dealt with the va: Yes, absolutely. I see the VA for all health services, mainly mental health. 
- Do you receive direct deposit payments (of any kind) from VA? Yes. 

### Wayfinding
User screenshares / 5 minutes
- Here's a scenario: you moved changed banks so you need VA to make deposits into your new account.
- You heard there was a place on VA.gov that you could update your direct deposit info for your education payments, where would you go to make a change? 
	First I would scroll down and click change your benefits. SO scrolling down I don’t see it immediately what to click but here it says change your va direct deposit infomration. Then I scroll down you have to login and the rest should be easy. 
Went straight there because you received it before: No, I could see where to click. 
- This is the actual home page; you're free to click on anything.

### Usability tasks
User is directed to the prototype.
- I have a link in chat to the prototype we're testing; please click on it. (Clicks on prototype link to DD-EDU prototype)
- We'll be using made-up scenarios that may not necessarily apply to you. We'll be filling-out a small form (or forms), and you're free to use whatever info comes to mind--fake numbers are fine.
- Nothing will be submitted because this is a prototype. However, we're recording this, so please don't use real account numbers--1234567890 etc. should work.
- For the purpose of this test, we'll go with what we said earlier: you moved changed banks so you need VA to make deposits into your new account.

#### Task 1 / View direct deposit info / 5 minutes
User reviews direct deposit information available for one or both payment types.
- Please take a look at this screen and find the direct deposit information for educational payments.
- Do you see how to get to it: I would sign in right here. 
- Describe what else is on this screen? 
	It shows what I can see the difference is the disability and education benefits. There is obviously a difference for which to edit. I would click edit. 

Where would you find the banking number: I would go to view history

That’s where you would go for the account number: I can see it right here

What if you were changing it: I would honestly find it on my bank account information if you know what I mean, I wouldn’t be using any bank. If it were something I would find I would see view my payment history to see if there were something there. 

To see your payments: yes

Routing and account number form paper: Right. 

What next to change them both: Click edit for the disability and change that infomration as well. 

What just happened: It looks like both accounts were updated here successfully and lets you know the account information there. You can easily see which account it is going to just like the bank.

Have you had to change it in the past: yes

You know what it actually does, what would you expect your next step here: I would expect a confirmation letter/email from the va stating that information has been changed successfully.

How long would it take: I would hope it would be incautiously , I wouldn’t want it a day later. I would expect it to be immediately given. 

IF the payment were schedule for tomorrow it would go there: No just a confirmation that the change was made to my information like your infomration was amended or added. I know the check wouldn’t go there immediately but a blurb that it could take time for the information to be changed over. 

#### Task 2 / Change direct deposit info / 10 minutes
User changes the direct deposit info to a "new" savings account.
- Let's say you moved and you had a new savings account. Update the information for your educational payments.
- What do you see here: It tells me I do not receive disability compensation. This is why I like these, you guys come out with crazy cool things. I like this because I can check if I am eligible for disability verse pension if I were coming in here brand new. The good thing is that it lets you know ahead of time that you are not getting one of these things. 
- You think you could get compensation if you see that: Yes. 
- What if you should get compensation: I see the number, I would call the VA. Hopefully they would know how to get the information changed on my end, that would be the most important part.
- Any other ways you’d like to contact the VA besides calling: A chat function would be nice.
- If this were real information, what would expect to happen after you updated? How long do you think that would take?

#### Task 3 / One payment type only / 5 minutes
User advances to a screen showing only compensation and pension direct deposit info.
- Please take a look at this screen and find the direct deposit information for educational payments.
- If you thought this was an error, what could you do? I can see there is a button for edit information so I would start there. 
- You would use the button: Yes, I would edit and verify the infomration. Then click update. I would expect right now to receive an email from the VA telling me that the direct deposit infomration was changed and if it were not you then click here. 
- Felt like you were hacked, what could you do: I see at the bottom if you think you are a victim of fraud call this number, I would call them. My only thoughts of that is that if it is 10pm on a Friday and I am scrolling through it after work, if I see there Monday to Friday until 8pm I would feel some type of way because that’s my money. I would feel some type of way not being able to do anything about it until Monday.
- What to contact someone immediately: yes or just something. Infomration like that you automatically need to take care of and like I can’t do anything until Monday. I don’t want to wait when it has to deal with my money. 

#### Final thoughts
- Anything to do to make it easier: No, I wouldn’t put a chat function there because there’s to many errors that could occur there. 
- You would like it if it would work but worried something may go wrong: I would like the chat box but I would make it so you cannot change the information in the chat box. 
- Overall impression: I like it. It is a useful tool to see information quickly and change it directly. You can see the type of payments you receive if any at all. 
 
### Wrap-up
Looks like we covered everything on my list. (ALT) Looks like we're at (time), so we'll need to leave it here. Is there anything else you'd like us to know--something we didn't cover about the screens we looked at, or VA.gov in general?

### Closing
Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us! Your feedback is critical to our team's effort to improve Veterans' online experiences--and VA.gov in particular. Enjoy the rest of your day!
