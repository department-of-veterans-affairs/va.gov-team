## Participant 1

### Intro
- OK, now that I'm recording, do I have your permission to record this session? Yes.

### Warm-up
- Would you tell us a little bit about yourself?  My name is chris I served in the Army on Active duty for 4 years then discharged. After that I joined the national guard back home for 2 years and my national guard was initially for 4 years but I ended up going to school in DC so I put a halt to the contract and shaved off the two years and I ended up using the VA for education more than anything. 
- Benefits at this point: no it has been about a year. 
- How often do you visit the eBenefits site? How about VA.gov? I don’t use it as much anymore because I don’t have a reason to use it. For any reason I need to use it I have my password and username to login. 
- What did you use it for: When you say va.gov do you mean ebenfits and myhealthevet. 
- Experiences with those: I use it to keep track of my compensation and that is probably the main reason I login. I used it awhile ago to message my healthcare provider for upcoming appointment and questions I had. I used it recently to check the status of my claims and education. 
- When you say education do you mean research or checking it: Both.

### Wayfinding

#### User screenshares / 5 minutes
- Here's a scenario: you moved changed banks so you need VA to make deposits into your new account.
- You heard there was a place on VA.gov that you could update your direct deposit info for your education payments, where would you go to make a change? 

Let’s see, go to myVA. I would probably say within the profile, I am not too sure, that’s where I would lean towards. I am not that sure. 

Straight to your profile: Maybe under records. This is good because I haven’t dealt with direct deposit for a while. 

You are now in your profile: Oh, right here.

- This is the actual home page; you're free to click on anything.

#### Usability tasks
User is directed to the prototype.
- I have a link in chat to the prototype we're testing; please click on it. (Clicks on prototype link to DD-EDU prototype)
- We'll be using made-up scenarios that may not necessarily apply to you. We'll be filling-out a small form (or forms), and you're free to use whatever info comes to mind--fake numbers are fine.
- Nothing will be submitted because this is a prototype. However, we're recording this, so please don't use real account numbers--1234567890 etc. should work.
- For the purpose of this test, we'll go with what we said earlier: you moved changed banks so you need VA to make deposits into your new account.

Describes the page: it shows the benefits that you receive and which account is linked to those benefits for direct deposit. 

#### Task 1 / View direct deposit info / 5 minutes
User reviews direct deposit information available for one or both payment types.
- Please take a look at this screen and find the direct deposit information for educational payments.
- What would you do: I would click edit and fill out the infomration then click updated.
- Where would the new infomration be, where would you find the bank information: I would log into my online bank account and go under profiles or my infomration and they should have it. I use bank of America and it is under my adnomination, it as all the account  umbers and routing number. 

One to checking and one to savings account, what do you see happened: I don’t remember the previous screen but I would assume this page was updated. Yeah, it looks like it was updated.

What is your next step: I am creating checking and savings under one. For disability I supposed I have that sent to checking and for education I would go through the same process. Make sure it is updated, Yupp. 

What do you expect happened with VA: The VA received information for my new bank infomration to ensure the direct deposit would go to the right place

What would you do next if it were real life: Maybe I would call my bank first, for me the best way is to wait to see if I am or am not receiving the direct deposit. If I see something missing I would call the bank and say hey look I should be receiving money, actually I would call the VA customer service line to check with them to make sure the infomration is correct then call the bank.

Confirmation it went through, right await or wait: I supposed you could do either, if you have the personality you could call the VA a few hours after it was updated to make sure it was updated. 

You expect it takes a few hours to be official: yeah, my personal experience it is good to wait a few hours because the VA stalls a bit at times. 

There’s a red bar there, what is it telling you: There is an error. I put 10 digits instead of 9. 

What would you do: I would go through it again to fix the error and update it. Wait a few hours then call the VA. 

- Why do you think there are two sets of payment info?

- If you thought you were the victim of bank fraud, what could you do?

#### Task 2 / Change direct deposit info / 10 minutes
User changes the direct deposit info to a "new" savings account.
- Let's say you moved and you had a new savings account. Update the information for your educational payments.
- What is happening on this screen: it states that you are receiving and what you are not receiving. The VA line. It states that I am not receiving anything I would call them as soon as I can. 
- If you come in here and should get compensation you would call: yes
- What else is on the page: Additional infomration to see if you are eligible for compensation and education benefits. This one seems to have all of the correct information and on their side they have the correct information to send the direct deposit. 
- Anything else noteworthy: No I don’t think so. If they don’t see records I could go view the payment history to make sure it is accurate. 

#### Task 3 / One payment type only / 5 minutes
User advances to a screen showing only compensation and pension direct deposit info.
- Please take a look at this screen and find the direct deposit information for educational payments.
- If you thought this was an error, what could you do? I could call the number with the extinction 711. 
- You noted it is the same number and looking for an extension, is this good enough solution if there was an issue: Well with regards to the VA I can find it over the phone but it would take a while. If there’s something wrong with my bank account and there is fraud I would be worried and want infomration immediately and if I call this number I would be on the line for at least 10-30 minutes and it can be frustrating. It is not completely satisfactory but I would call the number either way.
- Want exact extension: yes, right. I typically just call this number because I don’t know other alternatives
- What would you like to have happen to get ahold of individuals, text, email etc.: If it is texting it would be automated and wouldn’t be an actual person. If it were a customer service rep that would be great or using a chat box over email. 
- Let's say you know this is right, and you don't get educational payments. How do you feel about showing the message?

#### Final thoughts
- Thoughts: They are self-explanatory, you click on it and it lists each benefits. In my life it would be compensation and education so it is pretty self-explanatory. 
- What would be next or look to: I guess the two things would be the VA then my own bank. 
- You would be done and close it out then give it time and check: Yes. 
- How could we make things clearer? No, it is minimal so I like that. Everything isn’t crunched together; it is clean and everything is there. Nothing I can think of. Although I would say myhealthevet is to cluttered so this is easier. 
- Anything else you would like us to know: No I think that is pretty much it. 
 
### Wrap-up
Looks like we covered everything on my list. (ALT) Looks like we're at (time), so we'll need to leave it here. Is there anything else you'd like us to know--something we didn't cover about the screens we looked at, or VA.gov in general?

### Closing
Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us! Your feedback is critical to our team's effort to improve Veterans' online experiences--and VA.gov in particular. Enjoy the rest of your day!
