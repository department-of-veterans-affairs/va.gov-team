## Participant 2

### Intro
- OK, now that I'm recording, do I have your permission to record this session? Yes. 

### Warm-up
- Would you tell us a little bit about yourself?  I have received benefits under two education benefits, GI bill and yellow ribbon as well as VocRehab. I have received monthly payments for housing throughout the course of the last 4 years and I have used ebenfits extensively as well as phone centers including a bunch of times I changes my direct deposit infomration and have down it for C&P side of the house but I have found issues with that and found it interesting. I found that changing the direct deposit is easier for education rather than C&P and I have been unable to do it on ebenefits and had to call which is frustrating but I can change it for education benefits. Why do they need to be managed separately. It would make sense for 1 direct deposit for 1 SSN it would be viable. From my military service DFAS uses one direct deposit for one thing and for travel it is separately but in an era of budget concerns that would be something they would take and use on the backend of all services. 

### Wayfinding
User screenshares / 5 minutes
- Here's a scenario: you moved changed banks so you need VA to make deposits into your new account.
- You heard there was a place on VA.gov that you could update your direct deposit info for your education payments, where would you go to make a change?
	
  The first thing I would do is sign in because I would need to sign into my account so I click sign in. Using ID.me but I have found that when I try to use it says that the VA has used their maximum ID.me login.  I think I would go to my profile; I don’t see it here so I click the menu to see where it is, click direct deposit. 
- This is the actual home page; you're free to click on anything.

### Usability tasks
User is directed to the prototype.
- I have a link in chat to the prototype we're testing; please click on it. (Clicks on prototype link to DD-EDU prototype)
- We'll be using made-up scenarios that may not necessarily apply to you. We'll be filling-out a small form (or forms), and you're free to use whatever info comes to mind--fake numbers are fine.
- Nothing will be submitted because this is a prototype. However, we're recording this, so please don't use real account numbers--1234567890 etc. should work.
- For the purpose of this test, we'll go with what we said earlier: you moved changed banks so you need VA to make deposits into your new account.

#### Task 1 / View direct deposit info / 5 minutes
User reviews direct deposit information available for one or both payment types.
- Please take a look at this screen and find the direct deposit information for educational payments.
- What do you see: I see my direct deposit infomration and it is consistent with my profile. I see the two different accounts that they are separate for C&P and education benefits. I am able to edit those on this page for each one. 
- What would you do next: I would click edit for which one I want to do.
- Where would you find the bank information: Through the online web portal for my bank account. 
What has happened: I see that the account has been changed

Is that what you expected: This is in line with what I expected. 

Both boxes what would you do next: I would switch the other as well. 

Now what do you see: I see that the account has been changed and I see it is a different account but notionally it would be the same account. 

What would expect to happen with the VA: I would expect my next monthly payment in the new account. I would hope if the payment were for tomorrow that it would go into the new account but from experience it can take up to a month for it to change over. I would expect January but hopefully December. 

Would like it tomorrow but expectation a month: Yes. 

#### Task 2 / Change direct deposit info / 10 minutes
User changes the direct deposit info to a "new" savings account.
- Let's say you moved and you had a new savings account. Update the information for your educational payments.
- what is happening here: It looks like in this case I don’t have C&P benefits but I have education benefits. 
- If you should get C&P what would you do: I would call the number. 
- Having done this in the past, what other communication methods would you like: I tend to be multitasking and especially with COVID having other people around me I would prefer an online chat option so I prefer to interact right away instead of submitting an email. IF I couldn’t have an online feature I would call because I like to fix things as they are on the top of priority. If you could put a message in an option I would do that but it normally takes 1-2 weeks for a response. 
- If this were real information, what would expect to happen after you updated? How long do you think that would take?

Would you click anything: I could click the ink to see if I am eligible but I don’t tend to click the links because they take me to generalized F&Q pages that would be helpful if I didn’t know what I was doing but if I already knew what I was doing I would click that.

Next steps: I could use the links. 

#### Final thoughts
- Anything that could be done better: I think it is straightforward and it is fairly obviously shown by my easy of navigation. Assuming it works properly it is great, the issue I have had on ebenefits I have needed to call to fix it. That is the biggest frustration I have found working with these sites. 
- Anything you would like us to know about VA in general: Nope, nothing beyond what I already mentioned. 
 
### Wrap-up
Looks like we covered everything on my list. (ALT) Looks like we're at (time), so we'll need to leave it here. Is there anything else you'd like us to know--something we didn't cover about the screens we looked at, or VA.gov in general?
### Closing
Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us! Your feedback is critical to our team's effort to improve Veterans' online experiences--and VA.gov in particular. Enjoy the rest of your day!
