## Participant 5

### Intro
- OK, now that I'm recording, do I have your permission to record this session? Yes. 

### Warm-up
- Would you tell us a little bit about yourself?  I am a retired Marine Officer served 34 years and retired in 2007. I started collecting disability shortly after and it has increased to 90%.
- Do you receive direct deposit payments (of any kind) from VA? That’s right
- Educational payments: Yes
- Change the direct deposit information: not that I am aware of, my wife normally handles that for me. 

### Wayfinding
User screenshares / 5 minutes
- Here's a scenario: you moved changed banks so you need VA to make deposits into your new account.
- You heard there was a place on VA.gov that you could update your direct deposit info for your education payments, where would you go to make a change?
	I might take a look at records first or the disability.

What would the next step be: Then I see education there as well. Let’s see, I would fish around view the payment history.  

Clicked view payment history:  Alright I see here I stubbled upon how to change my direct deposit or contact information. Then I have a few links, one is change the information online so I would go there. It says I would need to sign in or create an account to do that.

Next step: Signing in. 

What made you go to view payment rather then the other options: it was the most logical path.

Payments are logically connected to direct deposit: right. 

### Usability tasks
User is directed to the prototype.
- I have a link in chat to the prototype we're testing; please click on it. (Clicks on prototype link to DD-EDU prototype)
- We'll be using made-up scenarios that may not necessarily apply to you. We'll be filling-out a small form (or forms), and you're free to use whatever info comes to mind--fake numbers are fine.
- Nothing will be submitted because this is a prototype. However, we're recording this, so please don't use real account numbers--1234567890 etc. should work.
- For the purpose of this test, we'll go with what we said earlier: you moved changed banks so you need VA to make deposits into your new account.

#### Task 1 / View direct deposit info / 5 minutes
User reviews direct deposit information available for one or both payment types.
- Please take a look at this screen and find the direct deposit information for educational payments.
- Describe what else is on this screen?

So what draws my attention is the box that says sign in to change the information then sign in or create an account so that’s where I would go. 

Do you see: It shows my accounts for disability compensation/pension and education benefits. There is an edit tab so if I were to want to change my bank for disability I would go to that edit and it should allow me to make the changes. It looks like it prompts me to put in the routing number, account number and type of account and update it at the bottom.

Where would you get the new bank info: Normally you can get it off of the check at the bottom.  

What do you see happen: I think the bank ahs changed and the last digits of the account number appears so it looks like the change took place and I would be satisfied that it was accomplished

What if you needed to change the other: I would click edit and assume it looks as the other one did and I would go in and make the changes as I did for the disability. The thing that is tricky here when activating the drop down I expected it to provide the choices. I am satisfied that it was updated within the system.

What do you think will happen in the process now, what is the next step: My next step would be to logout since I did what I wanted to

What would the VA do at this point: it would be good to get a confirmation email to confirm it was changed and for security purposes and if it weren’t you please give us a call. 

Email to officially confirm with VA: yes

#### Task 2 / Change direct deposit info / 10 minutes
User changes the direct deposit info to a "new" savings account.
- Let's say you moved and you had a new savings account. Update the information for your educational payments.
- What do you see here: I am looking here, the direct deposit infomration is there and I see a box for education benefits and VA history. The education benefits show that I can edit it so I can go in and make changes. For disability and compensation there are links and a number. I can find out if I am eligible but I know I am because I am disabled. 
- What if you should be getting disability, what’s your next step: Call the 1800 number
- Any other way to prefer to contact va about this: I don’t think so unless there were a live chat or a way to hit a tab to leave a question/message that someone would get back to me with. 
- How often have you updated your info?
- If this were real information, what would expect to happen after you updated? How long do you think that would take?

#### Task 3 / One payment type only / 5 minutes
User advances to a screen showing only compensation and pension direct deposit info.
- Please take a look at this screen and find the direct deposit information for educational payments.
- If you thought this was an error, what could you do? I think I would call because I would be suspicious of a hack. If the bank is not mine, first I would think someone hacked my account and my education money would go to someone else so that would be a fraud alert. I would call right away
- Anything that would help you here: I think so because I know education benefits is a different number than disability compensation. IF that 800 number were there it would make it easier than looking it up but I have it in my contacts because I have had education questions but the number would make it easier. 
- Have it available: yes and it say for questions or inquires call this number
- Where would you put it: Maybe put information in the education benefits box with the account infomration. Or live chat or submit a question. 
- What do you see further down: I see VA payment history so I can go in there to look at the history of payment. That could be helpful and easy. Then at the bottom if you think you have been a victim of bank fraud is there. The only danger is when we were up here before I may never scroll down to see that. That would be the only danger, we normally go through the page so quick and skim it. It may escape attention. 
- Let's say you know this is right, and you don't get educational payments. How do you feel about showing the message?

### Final thoughts
- What to make it better or easier: you are on the right track, it was easy. The changes that you get from us the last 5 % would make it perfect. You will never be able to satisfy everyone. Any box like education or compensation the fraud alert can go in there as well. 
 
### Wrap-up
Looks like we covered everything on my list. (ALT) Looks like we're at (time), so we'll need to leave it here. Is there anything else you'd like us to know--something we didn't cover about the screens we looked at, or VA.gov in general?

### Closing
Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us! Your feedback is critical to our team's effort to improve Veterans' online experiences--and VA.gov in particular. Enjoy the rest of your day!
