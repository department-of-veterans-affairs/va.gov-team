## Participant 7

### Intro
- OK, now that I'm recording, do I have your permission to record this session? Yes. 

### Warm-up
- Would you tell us a little bit about yourself?  My name is Ashely, I worked with the Air Force for 5 years and was security forces. I got out early due to pregnancy. I used the VA health benefits there, the va disability and I am trying to get them fixed now. 
- Do you receive direct deposit payments (of any kind) from VA? I do. 
OK, we'll be doing a couple of things today:
- First, well take a quick look at the VA.gov home page to get an idea of where you might look for the new feature
- Then we'll go to the prototype of the new feature we're testing

### Wayfinding
User screenshares / 5 minutes
- Here's a scenario: you moved changed banks so you need VA to make deposits into your new account.
- You heard there was a place on VA.gov that you could update your direct deposit info for your education payments, where would you go to make a change?
	I would look at the boxes on the bottom with healthcare, disability, education, and records. I am looking at records. Goes to payment history. It is a type of record to me, it is the banking infomration and because you already have it, it should be a record.

What did you think here: After I saw records and view va payments. I clicked it because we are talking about pay. 

Expect the disability infomration to be with payment history: Correct. 

Please go to payment history and click through to see the information: I think I should have scrolled down. 

If you scroll up, why didn’t you scroll and clicked here instead: The blue tab caught my attention and thought it was the link to go there. 

Deposit infomration tell you to do something different: To change the information online. 

Click that, what is happening: That green box. 

Next step: Only because of the first mistake, it makes me want to scroll down. If I originally scrolled down I would have just clicked on the green box. 
- This is the actual home page; you're free to click on anything.

### Usability tasks
User is directed to the prototype.
- I have a link in chat to the prototype we're testing; please click on it. (Clicks on prototype link to DD-EDU prototype)
- We'll be using made-up scenarios that may not necessarily apply to you. We'll be filling-out a small form (or forms), and you're free to use whatever info comes to mind--fake numbers are fine.
- Nothing will be submitted because this is a prototype. However, we're recording this, so please don't use real account numbers--1234567890 etc. should work.
- For the purpose of this test, we'll go with what we said earlier: you moved changed banks so you need VA to make deposits into your new account.

#### Task 1 / View direct deposit info / 5 minutes
User reviews direct deposit information available for one or both payment types.
- Please take a look at this screen and find the direct deposit information for educational payments.
- Describe what else is on this screen? 
	The green box, clicks box.
  
How is it different from the page before, do you notice anything: No not really. 

Login, what do you see: I see all of the information for direct deposit, so I would know where I would need to change the infomration. 

Go ahead and change the information, what do you see happened: My information has been changed. 

Seeing the two types, what is your next step: To change the bottom on as well. 

What do you see happened: That one has changed as well. 

As you were typing, it was closer, why were you so careful: I really don’t know, that’s a good question. It was fake so I don’t know why I took my time. 
- Why do you think there are two sets of payment info?

He is going to school and getting disability. Yes two separate payments for two different reasons. 

Where would you find the banking infomration: I would get them off of the bank app on the right corner or within the screen. 

Bank app: yes. 

Login to this screen and the boxes were messed up, what would you do:  To fix it on my end then call to ensure all payments were redirected. 
- If you thought you were the victim of bank fraud, what could you do?

#### Task 2 / Change direct deposit info / 10 minutes
User changes the direct deposit info to a "new" savings account.
- Let's say you moved and you had a new savings account. Update the information for your educational payments.
- What do you see here: I actually like this one. 
- What do you like about it: It is telling me if I think it is an error to give them a call. 
- Next step to call if you should get comp and pen: Yes
- Other communication besides the number: A chat. 
- If you know you didn’t get comp and pen, what else would you do if you could be eligible: If I never put in a package for disability I would click on the first link.
- What would you expect: You already have a page for comp and pen so I would find that page. 
- What if you are only getting education Go to the bottom right to edit. 
- Anything else valuable: The personal contact information. Part of the profile.
- What if you thought your account was hacked: Account security for me then the not down here. However the note is so far down I think it would be better in the little box up here. 

#### Task 3 / One payment type only / 5 minutes
User advances to a screen showing only compensation and pension direct deposit info.
- Please take a look at this screen and find the direct deposit information for educational payments.
- If you thought this was an error, what could you do? 
- Let's say you know this is right, and you don't get educational payments. How do you feel about showing the message?

#### Final thoughts
- Where could you find a record of payments made to you? What other features might be helpful on this screen?
- How do you feel about the tool: it is a lot better then doing it the first way around by changing it here then having to go to ebenefits as well. This is clear and cut.
- What could we do it easier: What if on the top of the first page. For the account when editing, could it show the bank up here because I know a lot of elderly individuals would want to see the bank and if they didn’t then they may get confused.
- As the routing number is in have the bank name populate: Yes. Even just looking at it myself how do I know it is even my bank.
- Anything else to add: No I think this is it. 
 
### Wrap-up
Looks like we covered everything on my list. (ALT) Looks like we're at (time), so we'll need to leave it here. Is there anything else you'd like us to know--something we didn't cover about the screens we looked at, or VA.gov in general?

### Closing
Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us! Your feedback is critical to our team's effort to improve Veterans' online experiences--and VA.gov in particular. Enjoy the rest of your day!
