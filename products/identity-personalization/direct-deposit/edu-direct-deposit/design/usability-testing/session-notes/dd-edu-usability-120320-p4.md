## Participant 4

### Intro
- OK, now that I'm recording, do I have your permission to record this session? Yes

### Warm-up
- Would you tell us a little bit about yourself?  My service exp[eri3ence was in the Army from 86 to 89. I was a motor transport operator, two years in Germany to take fuel and working in the tire shop. Changed tires on tractor trailers, while I was in the tire shop I had a blow to the head with that it was from the high force trauma. I didn’t have major issues then besides the bleeding then my year in fort bliss, TX was because I was motor transportation. My orders where to go there to drive trucks across the country but when I got there throughout the in processing center the CAV took me to be a major’s driver and I was back in country and extended for 4 months to get out of Germany but then ended up back there for another 3 months. 
- Do you receive direct deposit payments (of any kind) from VA? Yes I do. 
- Do you remember how it was set up: Not really I just remember them coming. Other than fighting with eh va for my disability reward for my service connection then fighting for it to get to 10 percent then finally getting my 100 percent and it showing up of 30K was a nice surprise. 
- Have you had to change it: No

### Wayfinding
User screenshares / 5 minutes
- Here's a scenario: you moved changed banks so you need VA to make deposits into your new account.
- You heard there was a place on VA.gov that you could update your direct deposit info for your education payments, where would you go to make a change?
	I guess I would go to records then change the address. 

You expect to change it where your address is, why: I would think that if I were to change it I would also need to change where I send the money. I see veterans ID, medical records, benefits letter. 

Looking at that changing your address would also be where changing the bank okay it: Yes. 
Looking for direct deposit what’s your next step:  (reading left side column), I would just go to my ebenefits page. 

You’re used to doing ebenefits, do you know where to find it: yes, when my page comes up after I am logged in. My options come up, I can see my payments, verify infomration, or I can change it to different bank accounts. 

I guess over here I see view VA payment history now and now I see change your address. 

Would you go to payment history: Yes. 

### Usability tasks
User is directed to the prototype.
- I have a link in chat to the prototype we're testing; please click on it. (Clicks on prototype link to DD-EDU prototype)
- We'll be using made-up scenarios that may not necessarily apply to you. We'll be filling-out a small form (or forms), and you're free to use whatever info comes to mind--fake numbers are fine.
- Nothing will be submitted because this is a prototype. However, we're recording this, so please don't use real account numbers--1234567890 etc. should work.
- For the purpose of this test, we'll go with what we said earlier: you moved changed banks so you need VA to make deposits into your new account.

#### Task 1 / View direct deposit info / 5 minutes
User reviews direct deposit information available for one or both payment types.
- Please take a look at this screen and find the direct deposit information for educational payments.
- Describe what else is on this screen? 
	(reading page), okay. I don’t see, there it goes. It shows me the page that was on there. I would sign in, yeah. 

Tell us what you see: I see disability benefits, VA payment history, education benefits.

If you need to change education benefits what would you do: I would go to edit education benefits. 

Next step: (reading page), I assume I would put in the routing number and account number to the bank I want it to go to.

Where would you find your banking infomration: It is in my check book and to make a deposit that’s where I would go to get the information. From here I would reenter my account number

Where does it need to be verify: I guess I wouldn’t. It is the account type I would click checking account. Normally it always has you verify the account number. 

Next step: click update. 

What happened at this point: We have updated the bank about infomration for education benefits. (reading page). It just says it was updated. Obviously, I would need to see what my old one was then the new one to know it actually changed anything. 

What would your next step be after the update: I would assume I did what I needed to do as far as that goes. I would want to verify that it happened because it is direct deposit. I would go back to my personal information to see it or would I just see it here for elsewhere. It would show what it is. 

What confirmation and then confirm bank slip: Yes, I want a verification that it actually happened or come back there to make sure it happened

How do you want the verification: I think the easiest thing would be to receive a notification. A lot of times I get a text alert from my bank that something happened that caused a change that I need to be aware of so it will send me a text or email and if I didn’t authorize it then to contact them.

Text that says we see a change, confirmation: Yes, right. 

If you needed to change both, what is your next step: I would go up to edit my disability and compensation benefits. 

Click on it and take a look, what next: I would do the same I would enter my routing number, account number and type. 

Same process: yes. 

- If you thought you were the victim of bank fraud, what could you do?

#### Task 2 / Change direct deposit info / 10 minutes
User changes the direct deposit info to a "new" savings account.
- Let's say you moved and you had a new savings account. Update the information for your educational payments.
- What do you see: A lot of times like for me if I have a claim for my disability and want to track and see if it has been process I may come here if my eligibility for disability compensation so I would click on find out if you are eligible. 

Claim in process, it will tell you if it was completed: Yes. 

Records tell you that you are not receiving it and you know you are due payments, what do you do: I have the VA payment history.

Would you check that: Right

Let’s say you checked and didn’t see anything what next: I would follow up with the VA, I always ask why they aren’t doing this or that. I fought with them for 12 years before I got to 100%. I don’t know if they know me personally or not. 

Anyway you can contact va from here: From what I see I don’t see a way t0o contact them. Quick questions since we are talking benefits. I am 100 percent total and permanent. I have my stepchildren receiving benefits from me and they are adult age. I can’t process it; I have to be there with them but can’t be the way to contact them. They cannot share infomration with me because they are adults. There’s a glitch in my stepsons and it makes it harder because there are different requirements than a child of mine which doesn’t make any sense because my personal opinion mine shouldn’t get benefits because of how they treated me but my step son lived with me since I he was 10 so he should get the benefits. I want to be as helpful as possible and with my background as a PA, a masters degree and research experience I like to share the information I have. I can input the medical way to help others input what they need to share to the people that need that. From my research experience I understand how this works. 

#### Task 3 / One payment type only / 5 minutes
User advances to a screen showing only compensation and pension direct deposit info.
- Please take a look at this screen and find the direct deposit information for educational payments.
- If you thought this was an error, what could you do? I would use the 800 number and have used it more than once. As of lately, in the past 2 years it has been 90 percent of the time wonderful to speak with someone. They are helpful and everything, there has only been one time for my stepdaughter because she called and worked with someone to do it online, the lady let her do it online with her and she waited as she entered everything. We were on the phone for an hour but she took her step by step. My stepson is a bit more male like I can do it on my own that’s where the glitches were and when we called we got someone that wasn’t so pleasant or helpful but other times I got others that were friendlier. 

#### Final thoughts
- Where could you find a record of payments made to you? What other features might be helpful on this screen?
- Anything to make it easier: my issue is the head injury and the short term memory and losing some of my abilities, it is a lot of what you are dealing with is veterans with disabilities. It is nice that it is here but most of the time it is difficult to find where to go. I see this and think I will need it later so I add it into my VA tabs so I can go back to that area where they are together. For the survivor benefits because I’m not dead yet, I have 100%, same thing when I do the education benefits and this is where the issue was. It asked if he is a veteran or ahs military service so that he can click that he is filing under the survivor benefit which doesn’t make sense because I am not dead yet. 
 
### Wrap-up
Looks like we covered everything on my list. (ALT) Looks like we're at (time), so we'll need to leave it here. Is there anything else you'd like us to know--something we didn't cover about the screens we looked at, or VA.gov in general?

### Closing
Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us! Your feedback is critical to our team's effort to improve Veterans' online experiences--and VA.gov in particular. Enjoy the rest of your day!
