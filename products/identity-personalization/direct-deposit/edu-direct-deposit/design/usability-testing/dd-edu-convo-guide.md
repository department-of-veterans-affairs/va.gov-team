- Sessions will be conducted remotely, setup will be tested 15 minutes prior to call-time; users will be required to share their screen
- [Associated Research Plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/direct-deposit/edu-direct-deposit/design/usability-testing/dd-edu-research-plan.md)

## Intro
Good morning/afternoon and thank you for joining us today. With me are a few colleagues who are helping-out by observing and taking notes. We are part of a team with the Department of Veterans Affairs that is moving some features of the old eBenefits site over to VA.gov. We're learning what veterans need to improve their online experience, and how we can make VA.gov more useful for you. Our focus today is direct deposit for educational payments.

There are a few things I need to mention before we start:
- The session should take about 30 minutes. But you can end it at any point--just let me know. We have quite a few things to cover, so to respect your time, I may occasionally break-in to move us to the next item.
- We're not testing **you** in any way--there are no right or wrong answers. We want to hear your thoughts about what we show you so that we can make improvements to VA.gov.
- Please say what's on your mind--good and bad. I will not be offended by any opinions you express.
- Today we'll be working with a prototype of a feature we're developing. Most things we're testing will work, but a lot of what you see isn't functional. But because we're using prototypes, none of your actions will affect your account or any VA information.
- We'd like to record this session. This'll give us a record to use for note-taking. We'll store the recording on a private drive, and it will be deleted when we conclude our testing and note-taking. No personal identifying information will be transcribed.
- I'll ask "on the record" once the recording starts.
- OK, now that I'm recording, do I have your permission to record this session?

## Warm-up
- Would you tell us a little bit about yourself? Your service experience, where you live, general experiences with the VA...
- Do you receive direct deposit payments (of any kind) from VA?
- (If "yes") How did you set up your direct deposit? if you had to change it, what was that experience like?
- (if "no") How do you receive payments from VA?
- How often do you visit the eBenefits site? How about VA.gov?

OK, we'll be doing a couple of things today: 
- First, well take a quick look at the VA.gov home page to get an idea of where you might look for the new feature
- Then we'll go to the prototype of the new feature we're testing

## Wayfinding
### User screenshares / 5 minutes
- **Please go to VA.gov.**
- **Now we're ready to start.** OK, now could you share your screen with us?
- Here's a scenario: you moved changed banks so you need VA to make deposits into your new account.
- You heard there was a place on VA.gov that you could update your direct deposit info for your education payments, where would you go to make a change?
- This is the actual home page; you're free to click on anything.

#### Things to look for:
- What is the user's thought process?
- What interactive elements does the user look for (e.g. menu, links, footer...)?
- What content/section does the user expect to find the educational direct deposit feature?
- Where does the user's search end? Do they make it to the DD landing page? Do they consider logging-in?

## Usability tasks
User is directed to the prototype.
- I have a link in chat to the prototype we're testing; **please click on it.** (Clicks on prototype link to DD-EDU prototype)
- We'll be using made-up scenarios that may not necessarily apply to you. We'll be filling-out a small form (or forms), and you're free to use whatever info comes to mind--fake numbers are fine. 
- Nothing will be submitted because this is a prototype. However, we're recording this, so please don't use real account numbers--1234567890 etc. should work.
- For the purpose of this test, we'll go with what we said earlier: you moved changed banks so you need VA to make deposits into your new account.

### Task 1 / View direct deposit info / 5 minutes
User reviews direct deposit information available for one or both payment types.
- Please take a **look at this screen and find the direct deposit information for educational payments.**
- Describe what else is on this screen? ...What other payments types do you see?
- Why do you think there are two sets of payment info?
- If you thought you were the victim of bank fraud, what could you do?

#### Things to look for:
- How quickly does the user find the DD info?
- How do users react to **two** types of DD info on the screen? Why do they thing there are two?
- Can users quickly locate the "fraud" box at the bottom of the screen?

### Task 2 / Change direct deposit info / 10 minutes
User changes the direct deposit info to a "new" savings account.
- Let's say you moved and you had a new savings account. **Update the information for your educational payments.**
- How often have you updated your info? 
- If this were real information, what would expect to happen after you updated? How long do you think that would take?

#### Things to look for:
- Do users immediately use the correct edit function (education)?
- Do users find the inline editing easy-to-use?
- Do users understand the tell-me-more accordion? Is the info regarding account and routing numbers clear and understandable?
- Are users satisfied with the success messaging?

### Task 3 / One payment type only / 5 minutes
User advances to a screen showing only compensation and pension direct deposit info.
- Please take a **look at this screen and find the direct deposit information for educational payments.**
- If you thought this was an error, what could you do?
- Let's say you know this is right, and you don't get educational payments. How do you feel about showing the message?

#### Things to look for:
- How do users react to the "You don't receive payments" messaging?
- What alternatives (if any) would users expect when they don't receive one or the other type of payment?
- Would users gravitate toward the View Payment History link at all?

## Final thoughts
- Where could you find a record of payments made to you? What other features might be helpful on this screen?
- What on the site would you do/look at next?
- How could we make things more clear?

## Wrap-up
Looks like we covered everything on my list. (ALT) Looks like we're at (time), so we'll need to leave it here. Is there anything else you'd like us to know--something we didn't cover about the screens we looked at, or VA.gov in general?

## Closing
Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us! Your feedback is critical to our team's effort to improve Veterans' online experiences--and VA.gov in particular. Enjoy the rest of your day!
