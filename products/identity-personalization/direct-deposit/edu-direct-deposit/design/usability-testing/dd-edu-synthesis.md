## Research goals
The goal of this usability study was to assess how easily participants located, understood and could change their direct deposit information. We also wanted to determine the impact of having both direct deposit (DD) payment types (compensation and pension, and education) displayed.

## Research methodology

**Our methodology:** Usability testing was conducted remotely using Zoom. We scheduled seven sessions beginning December 2; the last scheduled call was December 7. Six of seven participants attended, and sessions typically went 30 minutes. Participants were given tasks covering wayfinding and updating direct deposit information. Users were presented with a high-fidelity, fully-functioning prototype created using UXPin.

The moderator prompted users with tasks from the conversation guide. Participants were given a scenario in which they recently moved and needed to update the bank for their direct deposit payments. Users were encouraged to talk through their exploration of the prototypes, and to speak candidly about their impressions. Remote observers and note takers were in attendance, and all sessions were recorded.

#### Who we talked to:
- Six Veterans total; five men, one woman
- Age range was 25 to 64
- All participants had a VA disability rating; three had ratings of 90% or higher
- Four participants live in or near major metropolitan areas; two live in rural or outlying areas
- Participants live across the continental U.S., ranging from New York to California.
- Educational attainment spanned "some college" to master's degrees
- All receive/received direct deposit payments from VA, some received both C&P and EDU payments

#### Research questions
- Where on VA.gov do users expect to find direct deposit (DD) information?
- How often do users expect to review and/or update their DD information?
- What barriers prevent users from easily submitting changes to their DD info?
- How do users react to the two different "categories" of payments--and having to change them separately?
- What other features do users expect on the DD screen?

#### Hypotheses
- Users may have some difficulty locating their direct deposit information
- Users will rarely, some occasionally, change their direct deposit information
- Participants will accept and easily navigate the DD edit function
- Participants will have some questions/hesitation about two distinct Direct Deposit features
- Users may want more information about the DD change process

## Key findings
1. All participants looked for DD in the four white quadrants on the VA.gov home page. Two (notably younger users) believed the feature would be part of a user profile and signed-in. The rest looked through content pages before finding a DD link.

2. Participants don't change their DD info often. Some recalled having to make an update, but no specifics; one user cited frequent changes.

3. The only significant issue preventing users from easily changing their DD info is finding the DD feature.

4. Most users accepted, without comment, that there were two DD payment boxes. One participant found managing two different DD payment details frustrating.

5. Users were generally satisfied with the DD feature's functionality; when prompted, a significant number suggested a chatbox would be a helpful addition.

## Details of findings

### 1. Where on VA.gov do users expect to find direct deposit (DD) information?
Users were given the scenario: "You recently moved and changed banks; you need to update your direct deposit info to have your educational payments sent to your new bank." They were asked to go to VA.gov to find the DD feature.

- Every participant initially looked at the white quadrants when asked where they expect to find the DD feature
- Two looked at the Education quadrant; one looked at Disability, and one looked at Records
- Participants seemed inclined to go toward the last "payment" type mentioned in the prompt; from the examples above: EDU, C&P, and none respectively
- Two of the three younger users went quickly to log in; they went fairly directly to Profile and found the feature there
- The other four participants "wandered" a through content pages before finding their way to the DD landing page
- One user (100% service-connected disability), who had self-described cognitive problems, noted that it would be frustrating for users like them to read through all the text on the content pages looking for the link to the feature

> "I would probably say within the profile... I don't know where else I would (find it)."

#### Landing page(s)
- Users who navigated to/or were shown the DD landing page were immediately drawn to the green or blue button directing them to sign-in; none were inclined to scroll or scan the page
- When prompted to review the screen, users generally admitted they wouldn't read the text; most were looking for an action item
- Participants who were prompted to scan other content pages skimmed the text (older users), or ignored it (younger participants) and looked for an actionable element

### 2. How often do users expect to review and/or update their DD information?
Only one user mentioned multiple changes to their DD info. Most couldn't remember how and when DD was set up, not when they last changed their bank info.

- Of the participants who were asked, one said they changed their DD info frequently
- The others said they (or a spouse) changed it "once" or not at all
- None of the users asked recalled having to initially set up DD payments
- There was a generational divide regarding where users would look to find their routing/account numbers: the younger participants would use a bank app or website; the older users said they'd look at a check or their bank statement

> "A bunch of different times I've changed my direct deposit information."

### 3. What barriers prevent users from easily submitting changes to their DD info?
Participants navigated the DD page easily once they arrived. Most had a favorable view of the presentation and functionality of the feature.

- The most significant hurdle for participants looking to change their DD info was the relative obscurity of the feature described above
- Every user said the feature itself was easy to use
- No user encountered any difficulty updating their DD information once they navigated to the prototype
- One user did not notice the validation error when they entered seven digits for the routing number
- One user suggested that it might be helpful or "elders" if the bank name appeared once the routing number was entered (rather than after submission)
- The note regarding bank fraud was universally missed; three participants saw the box only when prompted to scan the page
- No user noticed the, "Where do I find this info?" accordion. Thisis in line with other instances of tell-me-more accordions: they are usually overlooked by users, even when prompted.

> "It's a lot better than having to go through that other way (eBenefits)... and have to look through all of that. There were just so many steps. This one is kinda clear cut."

> "Looks pretty helpful and looks like easy, intuitive."

> "So when you're editing, would you be able to show the bank up here? Some people when they're putting-in their number could probably get confused."

> "I would say the only danger is when we're up here before, I might not ever scroll down and see that (fraud warning)."

### 4. How do users react to the two different "categories" of payments--and having to change them separately?
Most participants took the two separated DD forms in stride. One suggested it was expected because the payments come from different programs. One user, however, took exception and was state that just one destination for DD payment was needed.

- Almost all participant accepted that there were two DD features; one explained that it was acceptable since there were two types of payments
- One user was notably irritated that there were two direct deposit "boxes" and wanted to know why there couldn't be just one
- Users who were directed to change their EDU payments used the correct feature; participants who were not directed to a particular payment type, went to C&P first
- Participants generally accepted, and even regarded favorably the "you don't receive this kind of payment" notice

> "Why (do) they have to managed separately to begin with? I would think from the VA's perspective, one direct deposit account per Social Security number would be something that would be viable..."

### 5. What other features do users expect on the DD screen?
Participants generally felt the DD feature was simple and straight-forward.

- The top improvement cited by participants was a chat-box for inquiries and confirmation
- A few participants noted the View Payment History link and said it would be useful for checking payments and bank info
- Another notable suggestion was to move the "fraud" notice into the boxes themselves; every user initially missed the note about bank fraud

> "It's pretty self-explanatory, I mean you click on direct deposit and it lists your specific benefits..."

> "It sort of gives you a breakdown of which benefits you're using and which account is linked to the benefit."

> "This is in line with what I expected."

## Additional insights
- Almost every participant said they expected further notification that their DD change was made
- Email and texts were cited as examples for expected confirmation
- Several users expected a long wait if they needed to call the 800 number with an inquiry
- Most users felt the DD change would take effect (or should take effect) immediately or soon
- A pair of participants believed there could be a processing delay of 30 days or a month

## Recommendations
1. Although finding the DD feature itself was the biggest hurdle for users, it's an important, but seldom-used tool. Maintain a "safety-net" of links on monetary benefits pages, and continue the reciprocal linking relationship with View Payment history.
2. Consider moving the note regarding fraud into a more prominent position. One suggestion is between the two payment boxes. Another possibility is including a one-line notice within the boxes themselves.
3. To clarify to users that changes will be in-effect immediately, include language near the "submit" button and/or within the confirmation message.
4. Participants universally wanted further confirmation that their DD change went through. Consider adding email notifications to users when changes are made. Let users know they can expect further confirmation.

## Next steps
1. Review recommendations with team.
2. Share research finding with business stakeholders.
3. Work with FE and content teams to implement design and text changes.
