**VSA AuthdExp/eBenefits Teams | November 2020**

#### Background
Background TBD

### Goals
Goal TBD

#### Guiding questions
- Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet?
- Consequetor unum dolorum stelare pluribus?
- Questions TBD

#### Hypotheses
- Participants will have some questions/hesitatation about **two** distinct Direct Deposit features
- Users will generally understand the presentation of the Direct Deposit information
- Participant will accept and easily navigate the DD edit function
- Users will have questions regading the DD process that the feature/screen itself won't answer

### Method
We will engage in moderated usability testing conducted remotely using Zoom. Remote testing is currently the only viable option, but the method should yield acceptable observations on which to base findings. Participants will be recruited using Perigean. These users will be provided links to the DD-EDU feature in staging (or corresponding prototypes). The sessions will be recorded, and observers and notetakers may be in attendance.

#### The process
- There will be a quick warm-up and introduction to usability testing
- The user will be provided a link to VA.gov staging
- The user will be given a test account password and email, and the participant will log in
- The moderator will outline a scenario (use case) for the participant to follow
- The user will potentially proceed through review and editing of direct deposit info
- There will be a quick Q/A and wrap-up

### Participants and recruitment
