### Background
Recipients of VA compensation and pension (C&P), or educational (EDU) payments can elect to have deposits made directly to their checking or savings account via Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT). Management of EDU payments is being migrated from eBenefits to be co-located with the C&P direct deposit feature in VA.gov profile. Users will be able to view and edit their direct deposit information for both types of payments in their profile.

<!-- #### Note regarding UAT
We're requesting that Perigean recruit Veterans who need to **change their direct deposit information for educational payments.** This can be done in-person at a VA facility, via phone using the VA hotline, or online using the VA.gov direct deposit feature. We realize that it may be difficult to find Veterans with such specific needs.

We will be testing an actual, functioning form that could change users' bank information for direct deposits. We will be asking our partners to keep watch for the submissions coming out of UAT, while we watch for problems and errors in real time. We will be observing the transaction, but not recording it, and this will also be clearly communicated to the UAT participant.

### Goals
The goal of User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is to determine if the new direct deposit feature is intuitive and functional for users needing to review their bank information for their educational payments.

### Method
Participants needed to view their bank information for direct deposits of educational payments will be recruited and given access to the new feature on VA.gov. We'll moderate UAT remotely using Zoom. Users will step through the screening wizard, then complete the inline form by re-entering their info, and submitting their 'change.' Remote observers may be in attendance.

#### Success criteria

Users will:
- Navigate to the tool
- Select the payment type needing to be updated
- Navigate the form
- Re-enter current account information
- Review and submit form
- Form will successfully submit for processing

#### The process

- There will be a quick introduction to UAT
- The user will log into VA.gov
- The participant will be guided to the direct deposit feature
- User will step through the edit-info form and re-enter their bank info
- There will be a quick Q/A and wrap-up 
- Success will be measured as 90% of participants can successfully re-enter and submit their bank info, and that bank info successfully saves on the backend and is reflected in the user's profile

### Participants & recruiting
Participants will be recruited via Perigean. The study will require Veterans (or dependents) who receive direct deposits of VA education payments. Sessions will run between 10 and 20 minutes depending on potential technical issues; sessions should be scheduled for 30 minutes, and at least 30 minutes apart.

Recruit for a **minimum of 5** fulfilled sessions using the following criteria:

#### Must have for participants
- Are you a Veteran, service member or a dependent? (pass = yes)
- Do you receive educational VA payments via direct deposit? (pass = yes)
  - If we filter participants by GI Bill, we should be able to assume they receive DD-EDU payments
<!-- - Do you need to change the direct deposit information for your educational VA payments? (pass = yes) -->
- Are you identity-verified (LOA3)--using ID.me, DSLogon, or MyHealtheVet--on VA.gov? (pass = yes) 
  - This can be confirmed by having users sign into VA.gov with any of their credentials and having them go to the VA.gov profile.
  - Can you log-in using your ID.me, DSLogon, or MyHealtheVet username and password now? (pass = yes)
  - Are you OK with re-entering your existing bank information? (pass = yes) (You **could** change your bank info if you need to)
  - If so, do you have your bank routing number and your account number available? (pass = yes)
- At least one woman
- At least one person of color
- At least one participant 35 or under and 1 participant over 55

#### Good to have for participants

- At least one person that does not have a college degree (to include enlisted Vets)
- At least one person that has a college degree (to include of officer Vets)
- At least one person who lives in a rural or remote area
- At least one person who lives in a major metropolitan area

#### Recruitment requirements

- Participants can use any device with a browser (desktop, laptop, tablet, phone)
- The participants have Zoom downloaded prior to the session (including mobile)
- The participants know how to screenshare

#### Team Availability

Please allow 30 minutes between sessions.
