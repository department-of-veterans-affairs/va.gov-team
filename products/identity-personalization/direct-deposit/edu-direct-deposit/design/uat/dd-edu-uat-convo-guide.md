## Intro
Good morning/afternoon and thank you for joining us today.

I have a few things I need to mention before we start:
- The session should only take about 10 to 15 minutes, but we can stop any point--just let me know. 
- If something is confusing, or you run into an issue or problem, please let us know; we are constantly looking for ways to improve our features and tools
- In this call you'll be entering or reviewing personal information.
- We will be using a live VA form--you could use this to change your direction deposit information. You are not obligated to complete this form--it won't be sent to VA to until you go all the way through and click the update button.

## Screening

OK, let's get started.

Today we're going to observe you using a new direct deposit feature. This tool now displays your educational payment direct deposit bank information, and allows you to change it. I have a few questions to make sure this form is right for you:
- I need to confirm: are you a Veteran, service member or dependent? And do you receive educational payments from VA?
  - If "no," end the session.
- Can you confirm that you have an ID.me (etc.) account? And do you know your username and password? 
  - If not: Are these easy to get? Could get you them?
  - If the user can not remember or retrieve their login credentials, they must complete the form unauthenticated.
- During this call, I'll be helping you navigate a form that can change your direct deposit information. So, can you confirm that you indeed would like to do this, and are comfortable walking through the form on the call?
  - If not end the session.

So today we're going to observe you navigating to the direct deposit feature. There, we'll ask you to review your bank information and re-enter it. If you choose, you can turn off video for this. We're not recording this session, but we need to see your screen as you go to the form. The form **does** ask for personal financial information. Are you comfortable sharing your screen? Would you like to turn off video while you re-enter your bank info? 
- If not: Explain this is necessary for testing. If they are still unwilling (e.g. because of personal info), end the call.
- Do you have your bank information handy? You need your routing and account number.
  - If not: Are these easy to get? Could get you them?

OK, a question or two about your computer and browser.
- Can you tell me what type of computer you are using today?
  - We ask because sometimes the type of computer can affect your experience with the tools. Knowing which one you are using will help our developers make adjustments if needed.
- Can you tell me which web browser you are using? Are you OK using Chrome?

OK, please share your screen, and we'll get started.
