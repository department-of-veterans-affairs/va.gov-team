# Paper checks discovery 

## Correspondence, 4/22 – 4/24

All info via correspondence with Frank Bryceland/Sarah Haddock/Adam Kinder/Melissa Rebstock

- Paper checks are issued for VA compensation. According to Sarah Haddock, there are 100,000+ paper checks still issued by the VA every month.
- People can switch between paper checks and direct deposit, but the exact mechanism for switching back and forth is currently unclear since this is not managed by eBenefits (**Note: See additoinal discussions below**).
- According to Camille Tello, it is OK for people to switch from paper check to direct deposit, but we should discourage and not make clear a mechanism to go back to paper checks if someone already has direct deposit.
- According to Adam Kinder:
  - People get signed up for direct deposit via the disability application process. If they want to opt-in to paper checks, they have to go through the Department of Treasury to do so. According to Adam:
  > The Department of Treasury requires all Federal benefit payments be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), also called direct deposit. Please attach a voided personal check or deposit slip or provide the information requested below in Items 30, 31 and 32 to enroll in direct deposit. If you do not have a bank account, you must receive your payment through Direct Express Debit MasterCard. To request a Direct Express Debit MasterCard you must apply at www.usdirectexpress.com
or by telephone at 1-800-333-1795. If you elect not to enroll, you must contact representatives handling waiver requests for the Department of Treasury at 1-888-224-2950. They will encourage your participation in EFT and address any questions or concerns you may have. That’s what our application says- but we don’t enforce. VSRs would process a paper check if the Veteran requests.  
  - To change an address for a paper check or to cancel direct deposit, someone has to [fill out this form](https://vbaw.vba.va.gov/bl/20/cio/20s5/forms/VBA-20-572-ARE.pdf) and mail it to their regional/intake office.
  - If people get paper checks and then want to opt in to direct deposit, they have to fill out this form](https://vbaw.vba.va.gov/bl/20/cio/20s5/forms/VBA-24-0296-ARE.pdf) and mail it to their regional/intake office. **They can not just go on to eBenefits and add direct deposit information. This will not cancel their paper check.**
  - People who receive paper checks from the VA should call 1-800-827-1000 OR go to a VA regional office to manage that account.
  
## Additional discussions 10.29.19 – 10.30.19

We recently revisted the paper check <> direct deposit issue because we felt that we had not thoroughly confirmed that when paper checks are turned on, direct deposit is turned off (and vice versa). Via David Hooper at VBA, we have confirmed this. 

Via an email on 10.30.19: 

>_Please see the attached information. Basically, anyone from the National Call Center or the Regional Office that has access to the Share application can make these updates._
>
> _In Share, user will select CADD command (or CFID if fiduciary is involved) and get to the 601 screen._
> 
> _In the DD/EFT box, if they are adding or changing dd/eft information, they would check the Change box and complete the fields with the proper information._
>
> _After making the changes and hitting Update, if there is a check mark in the Use for Payment Address box, they will receive a prompt that dd/eft and payment address are mutually exclusive and they’ll have to manually remove the check mark and hit Update again._
>
> _If DD/EFT information already exists and they now want paper checks, user will select CADD (or CFID) and on this screen will put a check mark in the Cancel box and hit Update. That will clear out the bank information and re-set the Use for Payment Address check mark._

David provided a screenshot that showed how the paper check/direct deposit info is coupled in the Share system, but I'm omitting that since Idk if that screenshot is sensitive information. However, I feel that is sufficient evidence regional office employees are able/supposed to update paper check/direct deposit info at the same time when someone is switching back and forth. That being said, I can't speak to whether this system ever fails or if there is ever user error on the part of the regional office where someone updates info for paper checks without canceling direct deposit (or vice versa), but I think we can confidently say that these things are/should be happening at the same time, and if they are not, this is user error on the VA's part and there is probably nothing we can do from a VA.gov perspective to prevent this/reflect this in the UI.

## Additional info Nov. 2019: Switching from paper checks to direct deposit

We have confirmed that you CAN switch from paper checks to direct deposit via eBenefits, and we have incorporated this functionality into VA.gov. Like eBenefits, we are using whether someone has a payment address or not as the metric of whether someone is eligile to receive compensation. If someone has a payment address but no payment info, they will see the option to add direct deposit bank info in their profile.

## What we should communicate on VA.gov

We should add the following content to [this page](https://www.va.gov/change-direct-deposit-and-contact-information/):

**To change an address for a paper check or to cancel direct deposit and opt-in to paper checks**

- Someone has to [fill out VA form 20-572](https://vbaw.vba.va.gov/bl/20/cio/20s5/forms/VBA-20-572-ARE.pdf) and mail it to their regional/intake office.  
- Or someone can call the national call center and they can process this request (1-800-827-1000).
- Or someone can go in person to their regional office to get this switched. 

**To cancel paper checks and opt in to direct deposit**

Someone can do this online via the VA.gov profile. OR they can:

- [Fill out VA form 24-0296](https://vbaw.vba.va.gov/bl/20/cio/20s5/forms/VBA-24-0296-ARE.pdf) and mail it to their regional/intake office. 
- Call the national call center and they can process this request (1-800-827-1000).
- Go in person to their regional office to get this switched.
