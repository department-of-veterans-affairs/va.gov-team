## Notes

- Direct deposit is set up on eBenefits for disability compensation, pension, and post-9/11 GI benefits.
- It looks like you can have different bank accounts for comp & pen and the GI bill, but need to confirm.
- Education Form 22-1995 has a section to update direct deposit information, but it doesn't look like there is otherwise a way to update that information on VA.gov right now.

### Fields needed to update banking info

- Account Type
- Bank Routing Number
- Confirm Bank Routing Number 
- Bank Account Number
- Confirm Bank Account Number

## Questions

2. What backend systems does this info connect to? Does VA.gov have access to these systems right now?
3. Does the direct deposit info in Education form 22-1995 update eBenefits?
4. Where is direct deposit on the Vet360 road map?
5. Can we sync the direct deposit data on eBenefits with VA.gov?
