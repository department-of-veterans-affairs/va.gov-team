Monday September 9, 2019 at 2:30pm ET

## Intro - 2 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Arthur and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about direct deposit at the VA. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 10 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** If you find something we show you to be confusing, we want to hear about it. Your honest insights help us to figure out how we can improve the veteran experience, and we will not be offended by any opinions you express.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.

## Warm-up/Screener Questions - 3 minutes

OK,let's get started.

1. First, can you tell me a little bit about yourself? (If stuck, prompt to ask about service experience, where they live, their work).
_**Notetaker note:** Missed this part of the call because it started a minute early._
2. Next, I'd like to confirm: do you receive disability compensation or pension payments from the VA?
    - **Veteran:** Yes.
3. Can you confirm for me that you have a DS Logon, MyHealtheVet, or ID.me account? 
    - **Veteran:** I have all three.
4. Do you know your username and password? 
    - **Veteran:** I'm not sure, I usually use CAG. Let me see if I can get my ID me login because I just got that last week.
5. Can you tell me what type of computer you are using today? 
    - **Veteran:** PC.
6. Can you tell me which web browser you are using?
    - **Veteran:** Internet Explorer.
7. Today we are going to observe you interacting with the new tools on your computer. Would you feel comfortable sharing your screen with me at this time?  
    - **Veteran:** Yes.

**(Pass presenter rights).**

OK, please share your screen, and then we will get started.
