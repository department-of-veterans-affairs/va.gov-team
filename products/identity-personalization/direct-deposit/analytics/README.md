  - Open = How many emails were open
  - Completed = How many emails were sent
  - Failed = How many emails failed to send
  - **Note**: We send the direct deposit confirmation email to both the sign-in email address as well as the email address on file in the VA.gov user profile. We do this as a security precaution, in case a fraudster tries to change the email in the profile to their own. As a result, we send more emails ("completed") than there are direct deposit submissions.
