## Overview 
Chapter 33 (Ch33) education benefits are paid to veterans using a system called BDN. BDN is a legacy system that is gradually being retired and various benefits are migrating to newer payment/management systems. VBA is starting with the largest EDU portfolio, Ch33 and migrating payment processing from BDN to CorpDB where payments will run through eMPWR. In this new system, there can only be ONE set of payment instructions. As an example, Comp&Pen (C&P) benefits have already been migrated to CorpDB.

Today, if veterans receive CH33 and C&P benefits, there are two separate payment processes running, one from BDN and the other from CorpDB. This allows veterans to input separate payment information for each benefit. As the VA migrates CH33 to the new system, payment instructions for both types of benefits must be identical.  

### Problem Statement 
CorpDB limits the payee information per person to one set of payment instructions, any veteran that receives both C&P and CH33 benefits must have ONE set of payment instructions on file in CorpDB. 

### Proposed Solution 
CH33 EDU benefits likely need to pass information through Lighthouse.

## Teams and responsibilities

### Authenticated experience (VA.gov profile)

Leads: Samara Strauss, Travis Cahill

The VA.gov profile team is responsible for the following:

- Overall coordination of this effort (through Samara)
- Updating the profile interface to combine the education and disability direct deposit forms into one
- Updating connections to Lighthouse to allow education benefit recipients to update direct deposit
- Coordinating testing across systems
- Launching and monitoring functionality

### Sitewide/Content

Leads: Danielle Thierry, Beth Potts, Randi Hecht

The Sitewide/content team is responsible for:

- Content/communications guidance around external comms
- Content updates for VA.gov

### Lighthouse

Leads: Janet Coutinho, Lorri Glover, David Lennon

Lighthouse is responsible for:

- Updating their code to allow education benefit recipients to update direct deposit via the existing comp & pen integration
- Coordination with BGS
- Working with us on all testing and validation
- Support as needed through this engagement

### BGS

Lead: John Dell

- Updating their code to allow education benefit recipients to update direct deposit via the existing comp & pen integration
- Coordination with Lighthouse
- Working with us on all testing and validation
- Support as needed through this engagement

### GI Bill (1990) form team

Lead: Riley Ross

- Updating the Chapter 3 GI Bill (1990) form to send direct deposit info to CorpDB.

### 526/527 team

Lead: Julie Strothman

- Managing any needs for the 526/527

## Outstanding questions

### Code

- Exactly what needs to be updated, and how long will this take?
- Will education benefits be allowed `add` functionality now in addition to `edit`?
- What can we get done by April 20th without potentially compromising the veteran experience?

### Testing/Launch

- How can we adequately test this code end-to-end?
- Is there any way to do a phased launch (likely no), or do we have to cut over at 100%?
- Given that BDN is migrating to CoprDB on a Saturday, how should we handle this on the frontend so we are not updating our interface on a Friday/over a weekend when no one is here to monitor the launch?

### Contact centers

- What capabilities, if any, will the contact centers have to update edu information after April 20th?
- As a result, how should we be directing people on VA.gov?

## Timeline

We are effectively kicking this work off on **February 20, 2024**, which means we have less than 60 days to complete this project. This is a rough timeline of how this might work **if the code updates are relatively simple**. If we get into the code and it's much more complex, we'll need to come up with a plan around what can be done by April 20th and create an estimate on when full functionality will be available again.

|Week| Tasks | 
|----|-------|
|Week 1 (Feb 19 -23)| Planning; Discovery; Design; Collab kickoff|
|Week 2 (Feb 26 - Mar 1)|Design complete|
|Week 3 (Mar 4-8)| Build|
|Week 4 (Mar 11 - 15| Build|
|Week 5 (Mar 18 - 22)| Build|
|Week 6 (Mar 25 - 29)| QA and updates|
|Week 7 (Apr 1 - 5)| Staging review; UAT recruiting Security review|
|Week 8 (Apr 8 - 12)| UAT, if possible|
|Week 9 (Apr 15 - 20)| Pre-launch for interface; BDN migrates to CorpDB on April 20th|
|Week 10 (Apr 22 - 26)| Launch interface updates; monitor|

### Proposed collab cycle touchpoints

Given the short timeline, I propose that we only go through the following collab cycle touchpoints.

- Kickoff
- Staging review
- Security review

#### What about design and research touchpoints?

Given the tight timeline, I think we need to make our best guess on design. We can gather *light* usability feedback during UAT, and implement improvements post-launch. We can also do more comprehensive testing and updates post-launch. The only pre-launch issues we should be concerned with are accessibility or security launch blockers.
