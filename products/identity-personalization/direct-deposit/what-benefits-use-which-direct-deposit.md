# What benefits use which direct deposit?

Last updated April 25, 2024

Given that there are two different backends for direct deposit — one for direct deposit for compensation & pension payments and one for direct deposit for edu — there is some (understandable) confusion on which benefits use which direct deposit mechanism. Here is a list of what we know as of now:

- **Disability benefits**: Uses direct deposit for compensation & pension benefits.
- **Pension benefits**: Uses direct deposit for for compensation & pension benefits.
- **Most education benefits**: Uses direct deposit for edu benefits.
- **STEM (education) benefits**: This is an outlier that uses direct deposit for compensation & pension benefits despite being an education benefit. This was confirmed by Joseph Preisser of VBA via email on 3.24.21.
- **VETTEC (education) benefits**: This is another outlier that uses direct deposit for compensation & pension benefits despite being an education benefit. This was confirmed by Joseph Preisser of VBA via email on 3.24.21.
