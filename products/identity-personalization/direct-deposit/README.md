# Direct Deposit: Product Outline

**Out of an abundance of precaution, the full product outline has been moved to [the private repo](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/direct-deposit/README.md).**
 
# Executive Summary

Currently, VA.gov is home to both **Direct deposit for compensation & pension** information and **Direct deposit for edu** information (currently in staging pending launch in March 2021). The original impetus behing adding this functionality to VA.gov was two-fold:

1. This was key functionality from eBenefits that we needed to move over in order to be able to retire eBenefits.
2. With regards to direct deposit for comp & pen, we originally moved this functionality over to VA.gov as a security measure. 

## User Problem Statements

- As a Veteran, I want to securely access and change my direct deposit information so I can receive the money that I've earned from the VA.
- As a Veteran, I want to securely change my direct deposit information if I switch banks or need to receive money in a different bank account.
- As a Veteran who receives paper checks from the VA, I want to be able to switch to receive payments via direct deposit.
