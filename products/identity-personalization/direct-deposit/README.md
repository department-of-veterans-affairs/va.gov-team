**The full product outline has been moved to [the private repo](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/direct-deposit/README.md).**
 
## Overview

Currently, VA.gov is home to both **direct deposit for compensation & pension** information and **direct deposit for edu** information. This functionality was added to VA.gov between 2019 - 2021 as part of the eBenefits migration.

## User Problem Statements

- As a Veteran, I want to securely access and change my direct deposit information so I can receive the money that I've earned from the VA.
- As a Veteran, I want to securely change my direct deposit information if I switch banks or need to receive money in a different bank account.
