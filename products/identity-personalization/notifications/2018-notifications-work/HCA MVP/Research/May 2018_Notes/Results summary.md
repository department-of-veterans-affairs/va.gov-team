<h1>Overview</h1>

* We tested with three internal folks — Jeff, Kelly, and Joe. 
  * Jeff had the most negative experience. While he understood things as a UXer, he felt that there were problems as a user that wouldn't be as easily understood or forgiven. 
  * Kelly had the most positive experience and didn't seem too phased by the whole flow.
  * Joe fell somewhere in the middle. He had a lot of suggestions but didn't perceive the experience to be as frustrating for users as Jeff did.
* While very few people's applications will fail, this is something that would be an incredibly frustrating and real problem for the people it happens to, and we should do our best to help them even if it's a rare occurence from a numbers perspective.

<h1>Takeaways</h1>

<h3>Submission confirmation</h3>

Overall, this tested pretty well. People generally noticed there was a chance that their application might not go through, but that may because people always read in user testing (and rarely do in reality). This is also before the part of the experience where something actually goes wrong, so no one has anything to be frustrated about yet.

Some conclusions that came out of testing were:

* We should not expect people to pick up on the nuance of "submitted" vs. "received" that we understand because we are tech professionals.
  * Jeff — "On e-benefits it says pending if its pending. It says completed if it’s complete. If it’s pending it’s sometimes because the back-end systems don’t work."
   * Joe — "Uh I mean at this point, if I did everything right then it should be fine and wouldn’t apply to me. I would feel really bad if I did get that second email and think, “What? I did everything right.” And I would have to go back and troubleshoot that, and it would be frustrating and time consuming. If I found out that it didn’t go through I would probably feel bad about it."
* It might be helpful to let people know when they should expect the email.
  * Kelly – "Uh, well i think everything is there. If i didn’t receive an email I would call this number and say do I need to resubmit. Except for I think I would probably want to know how long I should wait before wondering why I haven’t received an email. The difference between processing a claim and receiving an application... Do I check, and if it’s within an hour and I haven’t received an email do I call? Or within 24 hours?"
* If possible, it might be helpful to allow people to print their application summary either from that page or the confirmation page. This way, they have a record of their answers if they have to resubmit the application and don't have to remember what they entered. 
     
<h3>Failure email</h3>

This was definitely the hairier part of testing. This is when people started to feel frustrated at the hypothetical scenario.

Some conclusions that came out of testing were:

* There is a disconnect between receiving a confirmation page/number and then a failure email.
     * Jeff
       * “We didn’t receive you application” — that’s not true, I submitted and you got it and I got a confirmation page and confirmation number. You definitely got it."
       * "I would be really upset if I had been logged in. This is a total failure. I did the work, I submitted the application and you obviously received it and now it’s gone. I don’t know if we have PII problems but you have my email address. Can’t you at least send me my answers or the completed form so that when I go to fill it out again it would be easier? If I were a different Vet than myself, most people I work with aren’t as computer savvy as I am, and i could fill it out again really quickly. But I would think, the web way doesn’t work, I just want to print it and take it to my nearest medical center."
* People need more help and information than we are giving them in the failure email. Suggestions:
  * Mention this is the healthcare application, and include a link to the application.
    * Joe – "A link would be helpful, give me that link to go back to it so I could start from here, so there’s not chance of getting lost. (sighs)"
  * Make it clear they did nothing wrong on their end and that this was a technological error, not a user one. 
    * Kelly – "I think that second line, that the application didn’t go through because of something that went wrong on our [VA] end. I understand that is says on our end, but something that is a little more explicit so the veteran doesn’t feel like they are going to go in and encounter the same problem."
  * Consider minimizing the information about the call center if the call center is not going to be able to actually help them any further.
    * Joe – "I would be curious to see if I called this number to see if I would get the same level of detail or if they could give me more since this is my only real option here. I can only start over, can’t reply to the email, can’t click on anything - I might be more willing to call that number without links or more resources."
    * My note: I've heard that the call center doesn't know what to do with application confirmation numbers, so if this is true, I don't think we should include that in the email because I imagine people would call the help desk, reference the number, the call desk wouldn't know what to do with it, and people would be even more frustrated.
  * If there are any other helpful tips we can offer people a second time around, we should do so.
  * Jeff brought up emailing them a copy of their application, which we can't do because of privacy restrictions. But, we could potentially suggest they print their application before/immediately after submitting it. This would require additional functionality (likely) out of scope for this project.
* This concern came up a couple of times – how can we guarantee that someone'e application won't fail again? They don't want to go through all that work only for things to fail a second time.
  * Jeff – "How do I know it’s not going to fail again? Why is the system designed in such a way that you a have all my information and application and you obviously did receive it? Can I mail it in instead?"
  * Joe – "If I do this all again what’s to say that the application won’t go through again? Is there anything I should do differently to make sure that it would go through? Maybe saying common pitfalls or reasons they get held up? If there is a mistake, it says something went wrong on our end… If I do the same thing will I get the same result? Is there something that you’ve fixed? Is it better to wait? If you corrected a bug that might be helpful to know."
* How people would feel about the email:
  * Jeff – "This would be infuriating if I got this email, I would be really upset."
  * Kelly – "Um probably irritated, but like I said, you have an expectation that things don’t go through sometimes."
  * Joe – "Frustrated, I’ve wasted my time, and also just kind of frustrated with like, going back to the idea that something went wrong on your end so what is going be so different now before going through all that work to re-submit everything?"

<h1>Recommendations</h1>

<h3>Submission confirmation</h3>

* Don't rely on nuanced language like "submitted" and "received." Be more clear — say the application is pending or in progress.
* Consider whether we should suggest people print their applications prior to/after submitting.

<h3>Failure email</h3>

* Mention this is the healthcare application and link directly to it.
* Make it clear they did nothing wrong on their end and that this was a technological error, not a user one. We already mention this, but apparently we can't over explain this.
* Consider removing the information about the call center if the call center is not going to be able to actually help them any further. 
* Consider how we can make people feel confident about applying again so they aren't left feeling like printing and mailing an application is the best route.
