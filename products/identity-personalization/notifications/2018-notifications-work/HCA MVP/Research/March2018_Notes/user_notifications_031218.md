# Conversation Guide — HCA MVP Testing

[**Prototype**](https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/share/QYFXJH6RVNE#/screens/279927642_01-Home)

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 2 minutes

- Can you tell me a little bit about yourself? (If stuck, prompt to ask about service experience, where they live, their work)
  - Has been out since 2003, has been in the VA since 2003, has been a seamless transition especially in the realm of woman veteran.
  - Doing public health & public policy, hoping to work at  the VA one day "making some change from the inside out"
  - Loves her program, "in service, I was operations specialist; those jobs are very limited once you get in the outside world. I've always enjoyed pharmacy, so I became a pharmacy tech for 10 years…at a compounding pharmacy…just htought I was hitting the celiling where I was. Decided to take all the knowledge I had as a rx tech and all my compassion…toward the human race and idd my undergrad in public health [at temple]. I enjoy the diversity of public health itself…[you can do all kinds of things in public health, from teaching to research]. Throw a dart in the air and you can get a job."
- Have you ever used Vets.gov before?
  - Yes. "I've used it for looking up thinks…like the women advocacy group, I've been checking in on that lately, looking at some of the podcasts. In the past I've used it to download a release form, like a medical release form. Occasionally I get interested in the whole burial end, because I'm divorced, so I'm always thinking ahead [laughing]. A few years ago I was trying to put things in perspective for my loved ones here, letting them know my wishes in case something happened. And I've also used eBen and MHV…actually I was just on MHV, sending an e-mail to my provider."
  - Uses VA online services "a good four, five times a month."
  - "I'm on there a little bit more than others because I'm looking at podcasts and things of that nature."
  - Just finished a fellowship with Student Veterans of America in DC. Now she's only in DC on the weekends for an improv class, and in PA the rest of the week. 



## First Task: Evaluate HCA submission confirmation page - 5 minutes

Scrolls through, opens the accordions, clicks on privacy policy and then submits the application.

1. What is this page trying to communicate?

  * Scrolls up and down pretty quickly. "The page is communicating tha tthey've received my claim, that the process on my end is complete. They're giving me a timeline of at least a week, and I have a contact if any additional information is needed. I can print this out for my record or have it sent to me by emial…I'm given a confirmation number so if I do need to contact somene I have [that] so I can easily bring up my claim. There's an area here that I can click on to to see what happens afterwards; will probably give me more information on hwot he process will continue on VA's end….and also contact information with the times available."


  * [ONLY If they notice that they are going to get an email] When would you expect to receive that email?
    * [long silence] "As soon as they receive the application….within 24 hours, if not sooner."

2. Is there anything you would do next, or are you finished with this process?

   1. "Personally I would probably print this out, and once I've done so yeah there's probably nothing else I would…do do about it. If it would come up say, 10, 14 days I haven't heard anything, I would bring back the paper, the e-mail, and contact to see ifthere's anything else. But that would only be after a week."

## Second Task: Evaluate new HCA submission confirmation email 

1. What is this email trying to communicate?

   * "So this email was pretty much like the previous screen…explaining that they got my applicaiton. Little bit of a pet peeve of mine, I'd rather have the word 'receive' my application. [laughing] I don't know, it's just like, 'we _got!_' So they received my application and informing me of what steps are going to be happening next. "
   * Things I can do and things they will be doing, and what I can expect from them. Telling me about information I can keep for my records, with the confirmation number. Informing me that I should naticipate a letter in the mail, letting me know of the decision notice., That is the decision notice. And if I'm approved I will receive a phone call. Also letting me know the timetable again, that this will be in less than a week. If more than a week passes [I can call] and refer back to my confirmation number. Steps on what to do after I receive the letter, which I'm sure the letter will also inform me of, but just to prepare me. That i can go to vets.gov, download the handbook, find out my next step, learn more about my application, what I"m granted and what I'm not, and also informing me that this is an automatic email. In other words, if I would need to respond back, I would have to do so via the phone number during those specific times. Thta if I responded back to this email I would _not_ get a reply."

2. Why is the VA sending you this email?

   * "Because I finished my application and I chose to receive the e-mail in the previous prompt, and to keep me informed of the process."

3. What would you do if you had follow-up questions about your application?

   * "I would call [the number in the email] that's a toll-free hotline. And not apply again!" 
   * "I wonder if that could be underlined. If 'please don't apply again' could be underlined or italicized just to make it a little different, distinct….because I just saw it now. I didnt' see it the first time around. [lauhging]"

4. Would you say this email is useful or not useful? Why or why not?

   * "Useful! Everything's here in one spot, in a condensed form, and it's detailing exactly what I saw in the previous prompt along with some additional information…."

5. I'd like to draw your attention to the top of the page to the email address that sent this email — vetsdotgov@public.govdelivery.com. What do you think "public.govdelivery.com" is? 

  * "A ... list-serve service"


  * Would you trust an email coming from this address?
    * Yes. "I would trust it more because I know that I had just applied for an application, and within that application's prompt I was informed that I would receive an email, so I would be expecting to see an email from such an address. Anticipating it."
    * (If received a few hours later instead of immediately): "I wouldn't think anything of it. I would expect to receive it in the first 24 hours if not sooner…I would still be expecting it."
    * (If it showed up 2 days later) "I would have worried — why didn't I receive it earlier? I would still open it, but I would have thought or assumed I'd have received it earlier than that."

## Third Task: General questions about notification expecations and needs - 20 — 30 minutes

Thanks for sharing your thoughts on this email. Next, I'd like to close this screen and just ask you some questions.

- What benefits applications have you submitted to the VA?
  - "Disability, and voc rehab."
- After you'd submitted that application, did you feel like you knew what to expect next? How did the VA keep you informed about progress and next steps? [specific to voc rehab]
  - "No [didn't feel like she knew what to expect.] It's all new territory for me." 
  - "That was about 5 years ago, when I first applied for it, and I believe I applied via paper with my VR counselor. So as far as the process was going along, I was finding out more information through her in my bi-monthly meetings, than I was in my eBenefits. Although her assistance led me to believe that I was receiving all the infromation I [was supposed to] and there was no need to look at eBenefits…I didn't have a cause for concern."
  - [If applicable] How could they have kept you informed better?
    - "Mm…there's always room for improvement. [laughing] I feel like the e-mail would have been more sufficient than a letter, because even now…I do more communicating with my e-mail than I do through a letter."
    - "The emails that I would receive often got lost in the mix…that maybe if they were a type of messaging like MHV where the messaging is kept within the system, if that makes sense…I'd be more obliged to look into the system versus one of them getting lost in my e-mail, my inbox."
  - [If not already answered] Through what mean of communication would you have preferred the VA use to communicate with you in this process? This could be mail, phone, email, text messages, or anything else you can think of.
    - "Text messaging woudl be nice, although ti wasn't quite as popular back then as it is now. Everyone's text message notification is laways turned on and they're usually not too far away from their phone; that application can be seen. Versus e-mail, the notification isn't always on or you have to click in through a certian app to even see it…text message seems to be more immediate. Prompt, boom, right there and you're getting a notification."
  - What info would you expect VA to text you?
    - "Something a little more condensed than the e-mail, maybe a link to the information more detailed in the e-mail. Maybe 'this is your confirmation number'. Something as simple as we received your application; this is your confirmation number, here's a link to more info, or please check your e-amil for more information. Something simple but still giving me enough information but immediately prompting them to a link or an e-mail where additional information can be found."
  - Sounds like you want something you can refer back to. Are there other systems you can think of that would make that easier?
    - "Besides e-mail, I'm not really thinking of anything else. Are you referring to another messaging system, or another app…?"
- In what other ways besides submitting applications have you interacted with the VA? 
  - "Calling for appointments, or um…interacting at the clinic when I check into an appointment, or checking out of an appointment. The clinic personnel, such as social workers or benefits personnel. I mentioned vocational rehab, security when getting an ID card done"
- How could the VA have kept you better informed or communicated more efficiently with you in these interactions?
  - "Um…[laughing] since I am 40, I'm not quite a milennial, I"m not of the elder population, I find phone calls to remind me of my appointments a little unnecessary and often go straight to my voicemail. Unneccessary and cumbersome. If I could just have a text message…because most likely I already have that appt in my digital calendar. Sometimes answering the phone [laughing]…automated message just to remind me that I have an appointment, and if I don't answer that phone call, it's going to call me back in six hours again…so if I can simplly have a text message, I can reply 'ok' or 'see you tomorrow' or something along those lines to confimr the appt. It would be simple."
- In addition to everything we just talked about, is there any other correspondence that you can think of that would be helpful from the VA?
  - "i'm not sure how I would put it though. I've had some issues with things being delayed….or knowing the timeline of [inaudible]. I'm eligible for special shoes every other year, and there have been times in the past few years when I'm not sure of the…how can I put it…tracking of the process of where my shoes are. Because they're often sent to [the main hospital] first, and then it's difficult for me to know if I should make an apopintment with my podiatrist just yet, buecase the shoes haven't arrived to Allentown yet. Or sometimes they arrive and I don't get called, or I do get called and the shoes are [elsewhere]. Tracking of some of the durable medical supplies would help with that."
  - [If not already answered] Through what means of communication
    - "If I could easily go on MHV and click on 'durable medical supply process' and just see that the doctor order > sent to manufacturer > manufacturer sent to hospital > hospital received > clinic received > follow up appt. Something of that nature." Something almost Amazon-style. 

Now I'd like to ask you some questions about emails and other correspondence you might receive currently from companies or organizations other than the VA.

- I'd like you to think of the emails you currently receive. Other than personal emails from people you know, what kinds of emails do you get?
  - "I receive weekly newsletters from certain organizations that I belong to, obviously there's the coupons that go to my junk e-mail that I have specifically set up for that [laughing]…I think that's pretty much it. The newsletters are a big thing. A weekly or a monthly newsletter."
- Of the emails you just mentioned [list a couple examples], which of these do you find useful? What kind of emails do you usually ignore, or wish you didn't get?
  - Ignore: the coupons! "That's why they go into a separate email, so they don't clog up my personal and professional e-mail. I do find the newsletters useful, only because the content…I use to pass along to others, usually via social media. It's nice to read it digitally because then I can cut and paste it and stick it right on my twitter feed or my facebook."
- What makes you pay attention to an email that you receive from a company or organization?
  - The subject line and the first two sentences. The length of it, how condensed it is. "Usually the subject line will say 'this week's newsletter'…but it's the way the content is designed is formatted. Most newsletters have five or six stories or content points that need to get across, and those newsletters that have it very condensed in that e-mail with a title or two or three sentences and then a link to go to an article…I prefer those." If the summary doesn't interest her at all she moves on.
- What do you find annoying or unhelpful in these emails, or about receiving these emails?
  * "The newsletters that have the content of the story right there in the newsletter because I have to scroll all the way down through it to get to the next one…if by the second or third I'm not interested I'm usually deleting the e-mail by then."
- Do you ever receive things like receipts, reminders, or other notifications over text message in addition to, or instead of, email? 
  - "I do…my dry-cleaning! And that's always nice. I take it to a mom&pop store, so I know it's not going to be done within the next 12 hours…I'll see it pop up on my phone and it's a reminder that yes I have that sitting over there, and I know that the next time I'm in that area I'll pick it up…and it'll be done and ready for me to pick up."
  - Remember the email we had looked at earlier that said the VA had received your healthcare application? Would you be open to receiving that confirmation as a text message instead of, or in addition to, an email?
    - "I'd be open to receive in addition to the e-mail, but not the full content. The shortened, condensed version."
  - How would you react to VA sending you a Tweet or Facebook message?
    - "I wouldn't mind, I'd read it and possibly retweet it. If I felt that my community would get some type of benefit out of it. Mostly women veterans, anything having to do with public health and education."

## Post-Task Interview - 2 minutes

Those are all the questions I have for you today. Do you have any other questions or comments about anything you've looked at or anything we've discussed today? 

* "Nope, I do not!"
