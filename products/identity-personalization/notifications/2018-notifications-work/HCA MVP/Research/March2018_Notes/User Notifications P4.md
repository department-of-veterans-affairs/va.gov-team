# User Notification Research - Sarah (P4)

 

Moderator (M): so again, some ofthese questions are going to sound familiar, but since we have a new teamhelping to take notes today, I’m just going to ask you to share some of thesame details that you shared last week. Can you tell me a little bit aboutyourself?

 

Participant (P): yeah I’m Sarah
Bonner. I served in the Air Force. I was medically discharged and that’s why
I’m not in the Air Force anymore. I would hope to still be in if I could...
[participant audio cut out] VA medical center in Salem, VA which is near
Roanoke and I I used the CBOC in Lynchburg also. I’m a service connected
veteran. I have numerous things I'm service connected for. I’m also a Social
Worker and I work... [participant audio cut out] I'm trying to
think if there's anything else left to tell you.

M: Actually I think your audio hasbeen going in and out a little bit. I keep seeing the microphone icon be thereand then not be there so I think I caught about half of what you said just now.Would you mind checking your settings real quick?

 

P: It says it's restored. 

 

M: Ok.

 

P: The green on the audio on themicrophone. 

 

M. Ok. How's your internetconnection right now?

 

P: It should be good. I'm in myapartment, so...

 

M: Ok. 

 

P: [participant audio cut out]

M: Ok, well...

P: [participant audio cut
out] Is that one better?

M: Let me check real quick.
Yeah, why don't we try it and I'll let you know if the microphone goes out
again. So I have everything up until you're also a social worker. 

P: [participant audio cut
out] Can you hear me?

M: On and off. Nope. And you'reout again

 

P: I don't quite know what's
going on. I can try calling you on my phone rather than using the computer to
do everything.

M: That might be the best
solution if you don't mind. Going for the audio on your phone.

P: Would it be the 872 number?

 

M: Let me look it up real quickon the calendar.

 

P: I just need to grabmy [participant audio cut out]

 

M: Ok, it's the 872 number sowe'll be here when you're back. 

 

P: Yeah, let me get my phonecharger, it will be 2 seconds. 

 

M: Ok, thanks. 

 

[moderator and participanttroubleshooting audio]

 

P: Ok, I had to turn myspeakers off, that’s what it was.

 

M: Ok. That makes sense. Cool,alright. Thank you for being patient for that. So since we had the audio cutout at the beginning I'm going to have you share for purposes of our notetakers just what you had mentioned about yourself and your experiences. 

 

P: Ok. I was in. My name's SarahBonner, I live in Lynchburg, VA. I was in the Air Force. I was medicallydischarged which is probably why I’m not in the military now because I thinkI’d still be in. I use go to the Salem VA medical center in Salem, VA and thenI also utilize the Lynchburg CBOC community based outpatient clinic. I had previouslygone to for about a year I went to the Richmond VA medical centeralso. And I got out of the military 2006 and started utilizing VA servicesthe medical side of the services in January 2007.

 

M: Ok. And what are you up to thesedays?

 

P: I’m currently employed as asocial worker. Actually a Mental health case manager is my official title atHorizon Behavioral Health in Lynchburg. It's the local community service boardand we help individuals that have serious mental illnesses.

 

M: That’s wonderful, I’m so gladyou’re doing that.

 

P: Thank you. Some days are moreinteresting than others. 

 

M: Yeah, I totally
understand. Have you used vets.gov before?

P: Yes, I have.

 

M: What have you used it for?

 

P: I’ve used it for applying forsome jobs. I've used it to access medical records through MHV. I've used it toget access into eBenefits. I’ve just played around on it to learn more about ittoo.

 

M: And what’s that been like foryou, just playing around with it?

 

P: It's kind of been one of thosewhere I was using it to get ahold of eBenefits to really get to something else,so usually it's been an avenue to get to eBenefits. Some days it worksbeautifully and some days it does not work at all. Kind of the same thing withMHV. I've learned now to go through the VA.gov to then get to MHV because Ihaven't had a way, that’s the way I know it works type of thing.

 

M: Ok. Well, Hopefully we can getmore up time and have it work the way you'd like it to. 

 

P: Yeah. 

 

M: So now I’m going to share myscreen.

 

P: Ok. 

 

M: And you should be able to see ablank tab in an browser. 

 

P: Yes.

 

M: And I’m going to share keyboardand mouse control with you so you should be able to move the mouse around on myscreen...Excellent. Ok. So now we're going to go into the first part of the activity. So on your screen you should see a prototype ofVets.gov rendered on a mobile device, so it looks like you're using it on aphone. 

 

P: Yes.

 

M: And for this activity, we’regoing to pretend that you’re applying for healthcare on vets.gov. 

 

P: Ok. 

 

M: So, you can navigate toapply for healthcare and now you're on a page that says apply for healthcarebenefits and oh, it looks like you have a health care application inprogress. 

 

P: Ok. 

M: So you can scroll down andcontinue your application. Sometimes the scrolling is a little bit funky.

 

P: Yes. I’m using like a keypad,like a laptop so I don’t have an actual mouse. 

 

M: Gotcha. 

 

P: It’s nice that this is availableon a mobile device.

 

M: We actually build most products
mobile first to make sure that as people are using Vets.gov regardless of
whether they're on a mobile device or on their computer they are able to
interact quite well. 

P: I can see how it might be alittle bit more user friendly to somebody with, like, an iPad vs. like aniPhone depending on what size iPhone they have because I have one of thesmaller versions.

 

M: So whenever you’re ready you canclick the button to continue your application. 

 

P: So I think I have to goup. 

 

M: Do you mind if I just scrollinstead?

 

P: Yeah, thank you.

 

M: Sure.

 

P: Ok. 

M: So this is the fast-forwardsection the [makes sound to illustrate speed]. So this is not a page thatactually shows up on Vets.gov but for the purposes of this testing we're justgoing to pretend that you filled out the application whatever was in progress you finished filling out and now you're at the final step of reviewingyour information before you submit yourinformation for healthcare.

 

P: Ok. 

 

M: So you can continue. And now youan scroll down to review your application information and when you'reready you can submit the application. 

 

P: Ok, I don’t know what I did.

 

M: Ok. 

 

P: Nope.

 

M: And again, clearly this isprototype dummy data.

 

P: Yeah, yeah. I'm just havingtrouble getting with the mouse to.

 

M: Yeah. Since we’re not testingscrolling as a function this time I’ll just scroll for you if that'salright. 

 

P: Ok. It’spretty, it's nice that you can do it from a phone definitely. I think, I just think for me, this is just me I thinkbecause of eyesight and stuff like that, not that I have bad eye sight, I havepretty good, but coming to an application like this I think I'd be, I'd have aneasier time using it from my computer or an iPad vs. a cell phone. 

 

M: Totally. I can definitely understand that.

 

P: Not to say that I wouldn'tnot to say other people wouldn’t, I'm sure like I know several people I knowwould would do great on this. I just prefer something more gentler to the eyesso to speak. 

 

M: Yeah. 

P: But is nice. If you’ve doneit all and on a computer and you just have to hit send and can't do it at leastyou could, you know, say you’re at the library and it’s closing or you have togo somewhere, it’s nice if you can do it all over your phone.

 

M: So I think we had aslight click difficulty here so I'm just going to have us submit the application again. Ok, so now we’re on a page that says your claim hasbeen received. So, at your leisure if you're able you can scroll through thispage and read over it and then I’m going to ask you to in your own words totell me what this page is trying to communicate.

 

P: Well, it looks like someone justput a claim in for healthcare and the VA has received it and they have theconfirmation number which is nice because that can come in handy if they saylater say that they don't receive it or if there’s technology challenges whichis always a good thing. and then I see where it says you can kind of get theinformation. it’s nice also that you have your email to verify it that if yougo to your email there's an email confirmation. And it looks like you're youcan find out what happens. I'm trying to click on that but I don't know if I'mhaving problems or...

 

M: Yeah, so that's that’s justanother link that’s not in the prototype so if you click on it it doesn't work,but what would you expect to see there if you could click on that link?

 

P: I’d like to see what wouldhappen, like what’s the next step. Like what happens after they've received it?Kind of what’s the timeframe of when it would be? Like how long the timeframe would be? Here's someone to call if you haven't received something bya certain date. Some kind of like point of contact for facts and questions that could help with that. 

 

M: Ok.

P: So it’s nice again to havean access to something to print or just have a confirmationnumber to have and who knows what might happen? if you didn’t want to print ityou could always just take a screenshot of your phone or a print screen orsomething too. That's another option.

 

M: Yeah. What do you think youwould do with it if you landed on this page?

 

P: I would definitely be
keeping a copy of it. I might take a screenshot to say that I received it just
to keep that I received it and then print it out later. I'd be definitely 
writing that confirmation number and either printing that email or just somehow
flagging so that I have it for later because I may not be in a place where I
can actually email like print it off. I mean I have access to a printer, but
it’s good that I can at least save it somehow. 

M : Yeah, so...

 

P: And I would be following up ifI'm not, like if I haven't heard anything or I haven’t gotten any response Iwould be using that claim number to follow up on. 

 

M: How long do you think you wouldwait if you hadn't heard anything before you tried to call in?

 

P: That’s why if we can have thatif you had any questions link being able to know like how long to expect.I would be if I hadn't heard it would just be nice to know so it's like ok itmay take them 2 weeks to get back to me so that's going to save me potentiallycalling them in 5 days and yelling. it's going to save the person I may get ahold of from being yelled at, which I’m sure they would appreciate. It justmakes the process easier if I have an idea of what to expect too. At least Ithink what would be nice is where it says we may contact you for moreinformation or documents...I'm so sorry I didn't mean to be yawningnow...yeah...it's been a busy week and we had a snowstorm here. 

 

M: Oh yeah. 

 

P: So it says if contacting youwith more information or documents, having something as generalized likereference of what documents might be needed, if they need medical records, ifthey don’t need medical records. any forms they may need. something like that. 

 

M: Yeah, do you think there’sanything else  you have to do now or are you you just good to wait to hearfrom them. 

 

P: So I want to completelyscroll down to see if there’s anything else because I know that there’sprobably more or it just doesn’t end there with the claim being receivedso...But I can’t quite get it to the end. Maybe I am at the end and you couldtell me. 

 

M: Yeah so this is the end ofthe page here. This is where we get into the footer. 

 

P: Ok. 

M: So this box after it says needhelp.

 

P: OK. So and I Guess so when itwas talking about the 6 steps before when you would look at the veteran'sinformation and everything? Or you could hit the plus button to open it.

 

M: Yeah. 

 

P: I would have just been, this isme.  I would have been looking through that a bit more just to make sureif I had if it was my claim I'd be going through there and verifying thateverything’s correct.

 

M: That's really good to hear. I'mglad that you would be that thorough.

 

P: Yeah. And it's nice having thatnumber to call, the 877 number. It just my thinking...My only concern with thatis that I personally have used this number and I’m in this is something I’m inthe process of doing right now is I'm in the process of changing my bank. Sothe bank I've been with for years I need to change to a different bank. 

 

M: Yeah. 

 

P: And it's not the VA's fault atall. this is Bank of America's fault. I have been with BOA since I was likewell before the military and of course there was a bank that I signed everythingup to in the military the bank that I signed everything up to, after I got outof the military and had my VA benefits you know compensation go into them wellthey a few years ago decided to close out all their banks in Roanoke and forwhatever possessed reason it wasn't, we weren’t very happy 

 

M: Yeah. 

 

P: And they didn’t give any oftheir customers the chance to say yay or nay. 

 

M: Oh no!

 

P: And so everything...yeah. And soall of the direct deposit and everything that had been going through the VA foryears was going to there. Well now I'm at a point where now I have to change iteventually back to BOA. And so at the moment I need to I'm trying to figure outwhat the next step of that is because I I have a new bank account and all theinformation but I need to go and change that but I don’t know whether it wouldbe better to do it online or it would be better, I mean I think that's aneBenefits thing or to go if it’s better to do it online, I think that’s aneBenefits question or to go in person to the regional office in Roanoke whenI'm there next.

 

M: Yeah, so how would you want toget that information as to where it would be best for you to go?

 

P: I mean that's where I... I know it wouldn't' be MHV because that’s medicalcare. I guess it would be eBenefits. And I haven't been able to find that atthe VA. I just did this yesterday so it's pretty new. 

 

M: Yeah. did you mention that you
had already tried calling the number and...?

P: I hadn’t I had planned I tried to do it today and then today didn’t allow for it. 

M: Ok. 

P: Because what’s happened isthat phone number when I've used that phone number before it was when I got anadjust an appeal that I had going for my fee had go all the way to it had beenappealed in Roanoke and then appealed in to another level and then it went allthe way to the court of VA and they it went back and forth and back and forthand they it they made a change and so I got another thing and like I said therewas more changes happening but I had to call them because I got all thisinformation back saying that at first what had first happenedis I got the claims decision back and it said it didn’t have any decision andit basically looked like a denial letter from what I'm used to seeing and I'mlike oh great this is, you know. And then I had somebody else look at it andthey said no it's actually not a denial this a good thing this has gonethrough. And so I was like ok, well what do I do next with it and they told meso I called that 877 number and it took them literally they were so busy theysaid your call will be returned in 2-3 business days. 

 

M: Oh my goodness!

P: And I'm thinking, Well thatdoesn’t really work out for me when 2-3 business days well today is maybe Ithink it was actually a Friday when I got the...and then it was over a holidayweekend so, I think it was labor day weekend. So 2-3 business days was actually4 or 5 days later if that makes sense….so  and it was well that was too tojust get an answer if it was yes or no would have been a lot easier just tohave in like 20 minutes if possible. 

 

M: Right.

P: So that's why I'm weary ofcalling that number because 

 

M: Sure.

 

P: Because number 1 I alsowhere I work I have very bad cell phone connection so I would need them to callme back on my office number but that's kind of impossible to plan because my days are never the same no 2 days are alike and I alreadyhave clients you know plugged into appointments and sometimes thoseappointments go over

 

M: Right. 

 

P: or in the case of we had toclose the office we had to shut down because the snow was so bad last weekend.So, if I'm planning for them to call me and I’m not at work on Monday it kindof doesn't work out. 

 

M: Right, yeah. So I actually wantus to.

 

P: And to get an answer to that 2-3business days seems a bit much. 

 

M: Absolutely. I think I'd like togo into more depth with that with you right after we get through the prototypebecause we have a whole bunch of questions coming up around that and I'm reallycurious to dig in there. 

 

P: Ok. 

 

M: So I'm just going to put a pinin that real quick. And as soon as we do that activity I want us to return tothat. 

 

P: Ok, no problem. 

 

M: No, no It's yeah, just because,yeah I'm super curious now. 

 

P: Yeah I mean I hadn’t thought aboutit honestly until it came up so I think it’s good for both of us.

 

M: Yeah. So I know that you’d mentioned when we were up here in the prototypethat you would be getting an email to confirm that the application had beenreceived.

P: Yeah. It looks like it sends an email at the top. I mean I don't know how my
phone will happen sometimes too. 

M: Yeah.

 

P: I don't know. Yeah.

 

M: For the moment I'm just going tokind of hand wave that around because the prototype clicked through a littlebit too fast. But if that weren't there, how long after you first saw this pagewould you expect to receive an email?

 

P: I'd expect it, I mean I'd givethem, probably because of where I work, I would give them a little bit moreroom. I'd probably give them a day or so, a few hours just because of where Iwork with the internet being so bad. I would give them grace, a lot of itbecause I know how long it takes me to get my phone to work but at the sametime what I could also do is I could go on I could open google on my own laptopat work to check see if it’s there.

 

M: Gotcha. Ok, so now you can goahead and we're going to remind ourselves that the notification is there so youcan go up to the notification and click on it so you can go read the email.

 

P: Oh, ok. 

M: Alright.

 

P: There it is. 

 

M: Yay! So again, you'rewelcome to scroll through this if you're able and read it. If scrolling isstill hard let me know and I'll, I can scroll up and down as needed. And againI’m going to ask you...

 

P: It's not quite working.

 

M: I'm going to ask you to share inyour own words what this email is trying to communicate. 

 

P: It looks like I can't rememberthe individual...I think Jason, but I could be wrong…. Has applied forhealthcare and they are thanking you saying they've received the benefits,they've received that you've started a claim, that you've applied. They’ve gotat least the initial application and They’ve received it on march 8th. The confirmation number, whatto expect and they're saying you'll receive a letter. That's thekind of thing I would like to see if it was me. That they've gotten a letter,that they've received it. Even if it's an email saying that somebody's gotsomething. And explaining if they've approved it. Explaining, so they've calledit a decision notice. That's good to know so that you know it’s something sothat if you have to call back you can say yes, they've received it and theytold me I have a decision notice. So then I'm waiting to get a decision notice.And they’ll give you a call. A welcome call was always good. I’ve never gottena welcome call ever from them. 

 

M: Wow. 

 

P: But, hey I mean that's, maybethat's...I don’t know... I don't know that they’re the one they want to givethe welcome call to always. It would be nice to kind of know that somebody isreceiving it. I think it’s one of those things that it wasn't in place when Ifirst started this process. I’ve been at it though a while. 

 

M: Yeah. 

 

P: So, I like that it gives them atimeframe about less than a week. And if more than a week passes there’ssomething to call and the hours from 8AM - 8PM is a very good timeframe. Ihonestly didn’t know that they are open 8AM - 8PM because before this it'salways been bankers hours so that's always nice that it's 8AM - 8PM. And I usuallyam calling directly to the hospital and they're usually only there so. Andthey're saying go to the decision notice, what to do, where to check it out.I'd go if it'll let me. Oh there we go. That's nice to know that vets.gov is tofind out once you get the notice. Definitely having the handbook is good tohave something on hand to download or refer to. I honestly know enough that Iknow that's something that would probably be best to go and actually revieweven now because I don’t think veterans review that handbook. Or go back to itbecause things change. I’m sure I did review it but that was in 2007, butthat's been a few years ago. I think that's what and then having the findingout what to do next click is very helpful too. 

 

M: What do you expect you would seeif you clicked on that?

 

P: I would expect to see likewhat the next steps are, we've reviewed it, that this is the decision notice,if we've approved it, if we haven't approved it, here's what to do, what toexpect kind of thing and if we didn’t approve it like what you can do Becauseyou always need a fall back option if they don't approve. 

 

M: Why do you think the VA issending you this email?

 

P: I think it's Because first offthey are trying to complete with the technology generation. Many veterans areespecially my era the post-911 veterans especially the ones coming out now,They’ve all had, they've been using computers since they were kids. I'm not oneof them. I haven't been using them since I was a kid, but definitely since in thelater teenage years. But many times they’ve been, you know, they've been seeingsmartphones from the time that they were in elementary school. It definitelyisn't middle school, high school. They definitely have owned a smart phone.They are very up to speed with the internet and quite frankly it’s veryconvenient and it's very easy to access and I think that's a very good thing.You have to help meet them where they are with their needs or meet them withwhat works well for them which for the technology generation, that's what wecall it at work,. that's the one thing I get complaints about because we aren'table to email. We aren't allowed to for privacy reasons and I get a lotcomplaints that we can’t and I say well that's just the way our policy and theyget and that's because our CEO. We've had to be very careful with HIPPA. It caneasily we’ve been cited before for that reason. So Our CEO is let's just sayhas threatened to have us removed in handcuffs if we don't follow HIPPA soall...

 

M: Ok, so HIPPA it is. 

 

P: You know, there's a reason. Wegot fined quite a bit and we don’t want to get fined again. But I mean, I thinkit's different. We're a smaller organization and even though we still serve alot of people, the VA serves a thousand times more than what we serve. And so,I think when you’re trying to serve with the VA, such a big, nationalorganization and you’re working with folks who live all over the countryacross the country, this is a much, I think that email is much...I prefer emaillike this than if I was going through it than I would have paper. Or, if you'regoing to do it, do both. Maybe have the option to have a paper copy as well.And it looks like they're going to send you a paper copy anyway so you caneither throw it out, keep a copy like I would in a file, or put it in thecircular file type thing. But that's just something that would be helpful.This would have been helpful for me. And you know, It’s always nice to get awelcome call, that's always great. I mean, Putting some customer service to itis always nice.

 

M: Yeah. So looking at this email, what would you do if you had
follow up questions about your application?

P: I would probably I wouldprobably check in that what to do next thing just to see whether I had followup questions or not just for curiosity reasons but also I think with knowingwhat I know now compared to what I knew in 2007, I would have just wanted tojust educate myself on the next steps so I'm proactive and taking a proactiveapproach. 

 

M: Would you say this email isuseful or not useful?

 

P: Could you say that again?

 

M: Would you say this email is useful or not useful?

 

P: I think it’s useful.

 

M: Why’s that?

 

P: I think it’s useful.

 

M: Yeah. Why do you think it’suseful?

 

P: Oh, sorry. I just think it’sit’s nice that its saying that they received it. It's saying a little bit whatlike It gives you a brief overview that it’s been received, it’s considered adecision notice. And forgive me if I’m mispronouncing everything or making upnew names, I don't mean to, I just tend to do that. But it’s just nice that tohave confirmation they’ve received it as quickly as it came versus waiting aweek and a half for it to receive because who knows if the mail will be on timeor if there’s things such as right now we had a snowstorm. I live in a citywith seven hills.

 

M: Yeah. 

 

P: Some people haven't beenable to get up through some of the time. Or if we have another, like we hadseveral in the past couple of years where the city shuts down or if you have asituation where you've done it and you just you’re going to bed and you let itgo and you check your email and you misplace your phone but you can get to alibrary to check your email and boom that’s where it is, that kind ofthing. 

 

M: Cool, so I know that you saidyou’d cut the VA a little slack for getting this a few hours later since theinternet can be a little bit dicey. How would you feel if you were to receivethis email say a day or two after you submitted your application.

 

P: I would still be satisfiedby a day or 2 because I know with mail it would take at least that. 

 

M: Ok. 

P: Like I said, I think havingit both ways might be the best idea because than you’re covering all yourbases.

 

M: Ok, so I'm going to scroll usback up to the top and just draw your attention to this from addressvets.gov@public.govdelivery.com.

 

P: Ok. 

 

M: What do you thinkpublic.govdelivery.com is?

 

P: I would say that that’s probablya website that’s receiving things and then it’s emailing based on the informationyou gave to them. So it’s not something that you’d want to use as yourcommunication point because it’s more of a it will send out but does notreceive emails and I think if I’m correct the bottom of that email says pleasedo not respond to this email, it won't be checked or something to that. 

 

M: Yeah. Would you trust an emailcoming from this address?

 

P: I would I mean if it saysvets.gov@public.govdelivery.com I would because of all the with all the thingsthat’s on there I would trust it. I might also go behind and google to see ifit’s legit too, but I would probably be pretty trusting in this case. 

 

M: And after submitting anapplication like the healthcare application would you expect to receive anemail like this?

 

P: Yeah, I think I would be. Iwould expect it. Like I said I would prefer I would like this I would prefer itI think it would be best if you could do both email and physical mail. 

M: How would you feel about receiving it as a text message?

P: I would not. I'm not a...trust me do I text all the time, yes, I... to me
text messaging is less secure. Because not only that, I’ve been on the
receiving end of texts that weren’t meant to me. 

M: Oh yeah. 

 

P: And then just somehow Idon't know how it got to that. At one point, this is going to be a little bitoff tangent but at one point I had signed up for assistance through theemployment commission when I was in between jobs and was looking for work andsomehow my resume got floated and I started I receiving text messages about ajob potentially a job offer wanting me to log into yahoo aol or something.Yahoo online messenger. 

 

M: Yeah. 

 

P: So I kind of quickly figuredit was not legit immediately because that’s not how they operate. But it didn’tmake sense. but that's my thing. If God forbid the number is sent the wrong youknow 2 numbers are skewed or they hit fat fingered things, that's why I caneasily do. If that text message got sent to somebody that it shouldn't now theypotentially have your information and can come back and try… for identify theftI wouldn't trust it. And not to mention say that I have I'm married orsomething and I don't want my wife to know or I don't want if I'm at home andthen I'm at home and my phone bleeps with a text message and then somebody inmy family like a sibling or someone sees it, I don’t necessarily want them tofind that out, that information out, or if your employer, if you’re in theoffice and someone sees it. For me, I prefer it to be more private than textmessage. 

 

M: Are there other kinds ofelectronic communications other than email that you find to be better and moreprivate?

 

P: I don't mind...When it comes tothe government I prefer email or mail.

 

M: Ok. Alright So now I’m going tostop sharing my screen and I’m going to ask you some questions. 

 

P: Ok. 

 

M: So you talked earlier about yourappeals process.

 

P: Yes. 

 

M: And I was curious after you hadsubmitted your appeal did you know what to expect next?

 

P: I was using DAV as myrepresentative and I had previously worked for DAV so I had an idea of what toexpect. I kind of knew it would take a while. It would have been nice if I hada little bit more explanation. And at that point I would have expected DAV todo more of the explaining because they were my representative. Having workedfor them, I knew what we I was expected to provide to my veterans based on theorganization expected and I took that seriously. And I just found DAV not to beas helpful as they claimed they were going to be when I stopped working forthem. And I think in that case I'm probably not the most best person to askbecause like I said I had some experience in the game a little bit. But itwould have been nice to have an idea of the timeframe instead of it will be afew months. Well it can be a few months is it like a month, 2 months, 3 months,9 months, 12 months type of thing. Or having some kind of realistic becausethey used to send what I found that was funny is that they would say they wouldsend me a letter that said we are still working on your claim. Which was nice,but I'm thinking ok, so now you wasted this piece of paper that really didn'tneed to be send out kind of thing. 

 

M: Yeah.

 

P: A realistically thing like theclaim will be ready in 3 months type of thing or approximate or if it's orwe're still working on your claim and we're on this part of the process wouldhave been nice. 

 

M: How would you have wanted tohear that information?

 

P: I would have just rather hada real-time estimate that it's at this point, these are the steps in the claim,it has to go through there's this many it still has to go through this processand this process and you should have an expected date of January 27th, 2019.Something like that would just be easier than trying to kind of guess or that itmight be that we're still working on it because after a while every month it'slike ok, you're still working on it, that's great. But knowing Seeing morethat progress that's been made or just saying even if progress hasn’t been madeand it’s still at this one spot because they’re still busy with it and I knowthat they are very busy and I would have respected that but it would havebeen nice instead of trying Because the other issue is that if I got that and Ihad a question probably the first thing that I’m probably going to do is callDAV and say hey, what's up with this and hopefully DAV could answer within areasonable hour. The issue with DAV is that they are so busy that it’simpossible to get ahold of them. You're crawling all day long type of thing andthat's nothing it's probably the problem where if you were to call the 1-877number why it takes 2-3 business days to get a phone call back because they’rereally as busy or really more 10 times busier than the DAV type of thing. And Ithink the only way to resolve that is to hire more people. 

 

M: Yeah. 

 

P: and I don't know if you'll everhave enough people technically to hire because there’s a big organization.

 

M: So if the VA was able to updateyou along the way as to what they were doing to work on your claim or how longit might take Through what means of communication would you want to hear thatinformation?

 

P: I would have either gone. Phone
would definitely be great. Email would be great from them if I could get an
email but they never would send an email off and I don't know I don't remember
what their policy was, but if all else fails I’m going to go there in person
and say hi to them and I had the luxury of because of how close at the time
when I was living in Roanoke I lived 10 minutes away from the office so it was
the hardest part for me at that point was trying to get to the office before
they trying to coordinate it with my school schedule or work schedule. Bust
most of the time it was school. And actually it became quite easier at one
point because they had to move they temporarily moved their RO in Roanoke from
one building to another building across the downtown area and because of a
construction or a structural issue with the building and the blame was actually
on the VA because they had so many papers and it was basically it messed up the
foundation of the building. 

M: Oh my goodness!

 

P: Yeah, I mean, they came in.It was well known, the news was always in there investigating something so butso when they moved to this other building they were in the same building that Iwas in class. 

 

M: Oh that's convenient.

P: so it was incredibly convenient and I could pretty much go there whenever I
needed to because I knew the traffic, I knew the parking, I was already
gonna go there for class so I would just get there early and go to class. that
was very helpful having that. 

M: Yeah. 

P: For like 2 years it was really helpful. 

 

M: That's good. So in additionto the applications that you've put in with the VA, what other ways have you interactedwith the VA in the past?

 

P: I’ve, you know,obviously put claims into them, I've gone to the VAMC for treatment, way toomay phone calls. I have interacted with them, this was unique to me where I wasinterning at a program called TAP in Roanoke, VA, called total action forpoverty and what that program was it's a non-profit community serviceorganization that deals with helping folks who are specifically low income. Wehad the homeless veterans program that I interned but we had a housing program,an ex-offenders program, child care, a whole basically helping folks getservices that they would need that they couldn't quality for. Really helpingpeople trying to get back on their feet. And because of that I interned withtheir homeless veterans program so I did a lot working with them specificallyfor one semester. And I still went back and volunteered afterwards becausethat's what I mainly did for them. So we had a contact with the regional officewho was helping them get their claims sent through faster for expedited if theywere at risk of being homeless or at risk of becoming homeless and then we hada contact at the medical center also. And then we'd often work with DAV as wellfor their claims.

 

M: Ok. So with all those differentinteractions, what would have been on your wish list for being able to keep upwith yourself or the people that you're working with better informed?

 

P: Having a go-to person because itseemed like just that once we found the go-to person it made things a littlebit easier but it seemed like we had to go through 15 people to get to thatgo-to person and then that person would either be on leave and that happens, Iunderstand or would have moved to a different location so than we're stillgoing to that person without knowing often that it's not the right person. Buthaving some kind of contact that can help in between that we could go to oreven having like a team that we could go to to make things a lot faster wouldhave been so much easier. 

 

M: Would you want that go-toperson to be at the VA or DAV?

 

P: Well because of where, Ifthey’re at the RO, the DAV is at the RO so it would be nice if there was one atboth, Ideally it would be great if there was one at both but than you might getinto a slippery slope where you might have to have them with all the VSOs. Wejust used DAV primarily and this is strictly more bias than anything because ofme because of having worked for them I chose the DAV over all the other ones.And because it was a smaller office where there were 5 VSRs within that VSO andpartly that's because one of them I used to work with. So I could get throughto him quicker than anybody else could. Because it could be a cell phone callto him. Or just because he we...Basically at my first week at the internship itwas kind of figure out how to get our resources up and running better and howto navigate our resources and preferably have a POC at all the resource. Wewere also at the time working on creating a, we had a desk that was connectedto a computer and stuff and we were trying to have someone manning that desk atall times so if somebody came in they would have a question for us type ofthin. And eventually our goal was to have a center, like a go-to center forveterans and have it manned during business hours or have like a whole floorbasically. We never.. we got the desk area, we didn’t have enough need to havean actual center. A full floor was what our goal was. We thought we would needthat and we just didn’t have the need for that. I don’t know quite who came upwith that idea that inkling that we had that need, because they weren'trealistically looking at things and I kind of told them, I said we’re shootinga little bit too high and we might let's work with what we had and that's kindof what happened. But the first thing they wanted me to do was be able to kindof tap something resources-wise to be able to start link people to have a groupthat could help them with business attire or boxes. Basic things like hygieneproducts. If someone is homeless, how can we get them into the shelter? Andbecause I had previously interned and worked at the shelter I had a contactperson already I was able to link them to.

 

M: Gotcha. So in addition toeverything that we've... Go ahead. 

 

P: With DAV, like I said, DAV theywere the one that I was going to recommend before anyone else just because ofmy knowledge with them. And They have a very good reputation.

 

M: Yeah. In addition to everythingthat we've talked about is there any other kind of correspondence that you canthink of that would be helpful to get from the VA?

 

P: I...I...Definitely email andmail, like I said, are my preferences. I....like I said...Some kind of a phonecall or in the letter or email having a contact person to go to.

 

M: Yeah. What kinds of informationwould you want to get over email from the VA?

 

P: We’ve received you application,kind of like the steps: we've received it, we've followed up on the claims,this is the number, this is the status of it, or if you having or needing toget ahold of the patient advocate the actual number to get ahold of the patientadvocate instead of dial 888-982-2463 ext. 1000 which probably goes to thepatient advocate voicemail and good luck at them returning it type of thing.Having l like your point of contact to this person. Or we’re going to have soand so follow up with you and then they actually follow up with you type ofthing. 

 

M: Ok.

 

P: because like I said, wheneverthey transfer you to the patient advocate I'm rolling my eyes going and I'll belucky if I get a phone call back in 2 weeks type of thing. So it’s to the pointwhere I don’t even go through them anymore. I go through other people I haveand I wouldn’t even say that what I’m doing is the best. I don’t know if I wouldrecommend what I’m doing sometimes. So it's just kept to a situation wherethere's some unique challenges to it and I’m a little bit on the impatient sideright now.

 

M: Yeah.

P: So, it's just...I'm going tomake things happen one way or another. And it's like I said, you really don’twant me to put my social worker hat on or use my social worker voice because itreally doesn't go... things get a little rowdy at that point.

 

M: Yeah. 

 

P: So yeah...

 

M: So I want to switch gears alittle bit now and ask you about emails you receive outside of the VA. 

 

P: Ok. 

 

M: So other than personal emailsfrom people that you already know, what other kinds of emails do you get?

 

P: I’ve been doing a lot withindeed.com looking for jobs. so I get a lot of there some are jobs in Richmondfor this corporation, this corporation or this agency or this agency or in thisfield or in that field. I from them. I get a lot from people advertising frompeople getting me to buy stuff which goes in the trash real quick. And thenI've gotten just for some other things that I do a lot of extracurricularstuff. I do a lot of adaptive sports so I've gotten different information fordifferent programs and then I'm applying to grad school right now so I've gotseveral universities that I've reached out to them to get more information andso I have several of them responding back to me. It’s the kind ofthing one of those things that I have to sift through my email to get to emailthat actually are important sometimes because I'm kind of clogging everydifferent email server I use doesn't really work very well. So anything,certain things come as flags to me or certain things have key things that I cansearch for that's a little bit different.

 

M: That’s actually what I wanted toask you about. What makes you pay attention to an email that you receive? Fromvarious organizations...

 

P: VA related things definitely dobecause they're a necessary part. Things such as if I've applied for a job orif I've applied for grad school for something or I've started the process forsomething, something significantly thing that you've actually received it, I’mgoing to look for those. Say it's a group like an adaptive sports program thatI've applied for or a day of like we had a recently we had something forsnowshoes for an adaptive ski weekend that I’m looking forward to so of coursethat's one thing that I'm going to be looking for. And often it says hey you’vebeen accepted or something like that. Or for like the bike ride I’m doing in April,anything that says from world team sports saying that they've received adonation to my fundraising page I get an email from. Or if I’ve been acceptedI’ll get an emal for that kind of thing. 

 

M: Are there kinds of emails thatyou usually ignore or wish you didn't get?

 

P: The local news for some reasondecides to send me an email every somehow I signed up for it, I don't know how.Every time there’s a news event, which can end up being 20 or so emails a day.

 

M: Wow.

 

P: Yeah. So that gets I have tofigure out how to undo that one. So anytime there's an accident in the generalarea, I get an email about it. Or any kind of national news making statementsuch as all that was going on today with the walkout movement. or any kind of,sometimes it’s nice if there’s like a weather warning or something thatactually is helpful. Or what our dear leader has done this time or who he firedthis time or game he's playing with you know some foreign country or somethinglike that.. Those are the ones that I’m like, really? I don't need this. Iguess the ones that they send me when there's a road closures those arehelpful. If it was limited strictly to Lynchburg, not Roanoke because I don’tneed to know about road closures in Roanoke. But some kind of thing like thator like I said if there are weather delays or if there are school closures. Idon't have kids, but if I was a parent if there was a school closure that woulddefinitely be helpful. Or like I said if it’s a job that I’ve applied for andI’ve gotten feedback, I appreciate those. If it’s indeed sending me somethingevery other day that can get annoying a little bit but at least I know they'regoing to do it. And Like I said if I every purchase something from Amazon Imight get an email saying if you like this you might like this this and this orplease give us feedback on your purchases, type of thing.

 

M: And how do you feel about thoseemails?

 

P: Sometimes I have the time toeven respond…sometimes if it’s something like a purchase and I know that thepurchaser is like a growing it's like a startup business or something and thepurchaser wants to needs to have feedback about the purchase and if they’vedone their job I'll definitely give them good feedback. If it’s the kind ofthing that they need the feedback because it will help them grow their businessor something, I’m definitely going to be supportive of that or if they’ve givenme crappy customer service I'm probably going to respond back to them orsomething like that saying you suck or what's up with my thing? it wasdefinitely nice when I ordered form Amazon, I purchased a new bed so it wasalways nice to have an email saying it shipped early and it's going to ship onsuch and such date kind of thing. That's really nice to have type of thing.

 

M: That’s cool

 

P: Yeah.

 

M: Is there a particular company ororganization you can think of that does a really good job with notifications oremails?

 

P: Amazon is pretty good, but likeI said they might go overboard. eHarmony goes overboard. Indeed is borderline.There’s some days that they're great and there are some days that I'm like stopit. The local news channel way too much because they are literally sending likeevery time one country sneezes kind of thing. Like I said I guess I have tofind a way to undo those. I guess if I have like a recurring order, such as,not that it applies to me, like I said with amazon, sometimes we have arecurring order we can get dog food cheaper on amazon and it's the same kind sowe've had we don’t currently but we’ve had in the past we’ve had a recurringorder in regards to that. And like I said if I've placed an order or I'm tryingto do something having emails with feedback is always a good thing.

 

M: Ok. So aside from the frequencyof the amounts, is there anything in the content that makes you think that oneset of emails is more useful than another?

 

P: Definitely if it involves...Imean, There are certain things that I’m looking for that I kind of glance over.If it’s an application I've put in, It’s nice to know that they’ve received itand this is what they next bit of it is or this is what the questions that wehave, something like that is very helpful. it’s nice if it’s not a 4-5 pageemail. If it can be...And I’ve got to be careful because I'm sending them outtoo...I’m guilty as charged with that one but if it’s something where it can besummarized that’s a good thing. Or if it’s a pleasure email or you know anemail to relay concerns about something that’s different. I give... I'm g8uiltyof sending them out too. But having something like that. If it can just shootthe breeze it might be longer than others versus if there's  a problemwith something it’s nice that you can send an email and try to keep it under acertain length. Or this is we've received your concern, this is what we thinkyou're meaning, if this is wrong, please let us know and this is what we’re doing to fix it and if you want to be as specific as you want. I've gotno problem with that if someone’s being very specific about something I wouldprefer that actually. So like I said as someone who has to document every timeI basically breathe with my job, with any and all interactions with my clientsI understand the difficulties of being too over over detailed with notes andI’m guilty as charged with over documenting stuff, I do that all the time. Buthaving something where figuring out and like I said it’s a delicate balance andI’m learning how to do this so...

 

M: Yeah. And then, one lastquestion kind of outside of this flow, I want to go back to the thing that youtalked about way earlier in the session. 

 

P: Ok. 

 

M: Just because were working oncontent and copy and things that we're going to be sending out to veterans.You'd mentioned that you’d' received a letter for your appeal that had nodecision on it that you said looked like a denial letter. 

 

P: Yeah. 

 

M: I just wanted to...

 

P: Yeah...what happened was thiswas a it was not by email, it was mail.

 

M: Yeah. 

 

P: It was a paper copy. It was in2012 and I want to say probably around this time in 2012, imaginethat. I know I was still in community college at the time and that’s why Iremember so vividly. I was in community college because I wasn't goingto...because when I took classes at Radford that's where I was next to them whenthey moved to their temporary location. That's when I was there all the time Icould go there all the time because it was the same location and everything.So, This was a time that I wasn’t and I wasn't as familiar with the area yet.It actually helped me become familiar with the area. And it was one of thosethat was an appeal regarding [inaudible]. I had that January of 2012 gone to ahearing at the film center is what we called the film building or the filmcenter I can't remember the name of exactly what it was. All I know is it wasnext door to where I went to school, where I would soon be going to school. Thehearing happened in January and then I did not hear anything back which I knewis kind of what happens. It takes a while. and then I got this big thickenvelope with a decision that had like 20 pages attached like stapled togetherstating the general stuff that you know, name, what the rate what the claim wasfor and started going through it. And it was like they left one page out orsomething and it was there was no decision. It was like... so I'm thinking andthe other thing is that when they send those things to you they should probablysave themselves and me and every other veteran and them a lot of time andheadache of trying to read through everything because they seem to say the samething either 5 different times in 5 different ways or they speak legalterminology which the average Joe and Jane do not understand. At some pointthey are saying we granted you service connection because of this, this, this,this this at this rate which gives you this, this this this and the next higherrating requires you to be at this this this this this. For those I can figurethose out. Or we didn't give you service connection, we denied you serviceconnecti0on on this this and this. Here's what you can do to appeal. Instead ofsection law CFR such and such and such and this and this which honestly I don'tcare because I don't know what CFR you're talking about type of thing.

 

M: Ok. So...

 

P: Most of us who have gone throughthe military, by the time we're out, we don’t really care what regulation we'redealing with. We've already dealt with a lot of them. We kind of need to knowif you're going to service connect it or not why and what do I have to do to eitherget you to service connect it or get it to the correct rating type ofthing. 

 

M: So, if we were to just pie inthe sky ideating and just wanted to make sure that we didn't make someone thingthey had gotten a denial letter when they hadn't actually gotten a denialletter, what are some of the things that we'd want to stay away from?

 

P: Putting the decision up closerto the top. Or what our decision was because what they say isusually...Unfortunately I don’t have any of my claims right away here. 

 

M: That's ok. 

 

P: But I kind of have an idea. Iwas talking to a  friend of mine who was applying for VA benefits and Iwas giving him a heads up about this. And if you need further information I canprobably talk to him to give you further feedback because he has done moreonline than he has. Just because the way they out processed him at Ft. Braggthey did it that way. And he's been using since he could walk basically. He's abit younger and he's much more computer literate than I am too. But, his thing saidlike what he claimed, what evidence he provided, and what their decision wasand in conclusion it highlighted the decision. It was half the paperwork that Ihad gotten in any of my stuff and he was claiming more things than I probablywas at the time. 

 

M: Ok. 

 

P: And he did not have anyonerepresenting him which I believe was the difference maker and I quickly toldhim to resolve that and I quickly assisted him with getting in touch with theDAV but that was the issue that time in 2012 and there was all these pages andall these pages and I'm flipping through, flipping through, flipping through,and I was like where was the darn answer. Did you grant it or did you not grantit? That's all I’m needing. I don't need all of this other you know in this caseversus this person and this person versus the supreme court and VA court andall that. I don't need all them. I don't even need all the different paperworkclaiming this particular bill and that particular bill and thing that you'veincluded in all this. I don't necessarily need that. If you want to say thatwe've reference all these things and list them as like an attachment at the endyou might take it up 2 or 3 pages doing it that way. I’d rather you do that ifit says paragraphs in the long run. or you could say our decision was to dothis, and to do this, and this is how it's going to affect your benefits typeof thing. 

 

M: Alright. I think that's all thequestions I have for you. Do you have any other questions, comments or thoughtsthat you'd like to share while we're on the phone. 

 

P: I guess the other question Ihave is having to change banks. I don't know if you could guide me in that orif that's you may not be able to and that's fine. I can call someone. 

 

M: I don't think I can, unfortunatelysince I just, you have just seen me do my job. I work on vets.gov and talk topeople like you and that's about my entire scope that knowledge base. 

 

P: Ok. That's fine. I'm going tocall. I'm going to try to see. I have to go down to Roanoke next week. I mayjust take a little bit earlier off next week and go for that. 

 

M: But, but my colleague is tellingme right now... Oh! That you should be able to do it on eBenefits. 

 

P: Ok, so that's even easier. I cando it through there. 

 

M: I can actually...I can email youthe URL that she just sent me. It's under your manage menu on your eBenefitsprofile. 

 

P: Ok. Ok, that'd be awesome. 

 

M: It should be manage and thencontact. 

 

P: Ok. That's easy.

 

M: Great...
