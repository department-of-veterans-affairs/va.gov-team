<h2>Why transactional emails can not allow for replies — Call with Rita Grewal</h2>

**3/29/17**

I just talked to Rita (privacy officer) and here are the important takeaways from the call:

1. She says that she thinks there are other entities in the VA that automatically bounce emails so this has to be possible, but she couldn't give me an example of one. Basically, she says we have to figure this out technically, so I'm not sure if we should push the help desk further or figure out if there are other people who can help us.

2. The issue with having an inbox is that the VA could be to blame if veterans sent in PII and then there was a security breach and someone got access to the inbox. We're not responsible for the veteran's action on their end but we ARE responsible for anything that ends up on the VA side.

3. We can *not* solve this by putting in some type of legalese copy at the bottom of an email that makes it clear they should not reply with any PHI or PII. She said that would just open us up to problems.

4. Re: MHV, the only example she could give me was that they have secure messaging behind a log-in, which is obviously not what we are looking for here. I do *not* know if MHV has other notifications they send to people's inboxes but we should look into that and their set up.

<h2>Getting approval for notification emails</h2>

* Work with the Vets.gov privacy officer — Rita Grewal (Rita.Grewal@va.gov).
* Send her an email explaining you need her approval on an email we plan to send to users. Give her enough context so she knows when and why the email would be sent. Attach the copy/content for her review.
* Rita should reply fairly quickly with approval or updates. 

<h2>Call with Rita Grewal</h2>

**3/9/17**

Notes from the call:

1. We can **sometimes** say the application type and number if it is general enough. For example, it is OK to say that someone has applied for healthcare or pension benefits, but it is NOT ok to say someone has applied for disability benefits. We should review this with the privacy office on a case by case basis.
2. Rita mentioned that we need to update our PTA (privacy threshold analysis) /PIA (privacy impact analysis) for vets.gov to say that we are going to be sending automated emails. If you know more about what this means or how to do this or how I can help make this happen, please let me know.
3. Rita says we should be getting approval on all emails through the privacy office, but she assured me that their interest is only in making sure we aren't sending anything sensitive and that our team will still have full editorial control as long as we are within privacy guidelines. I can help facilitate this for the healthcare notification MVP and connect Ryan to Rita once copy is ready for the pension notification.
4. Rita's biggest concern was that these emails are one way, automated emails that people can not reply to because she's afraid someone may reply with sensitive information. I assured her these were one way emails, but asked people to let me know if this isn't entirely accurate.

<h2>Emails with Rita Grewal, Vets.gov Privacy Officer</h2>

Per an email from Rita on 3/7/18, we CAN say the following over email:

* That someone applied for healthcare benefits
* The healthcare application number (10-10EZ)
* Confirmation number
* Date something was submitted

We can **not** say someone's name with any of this information.

<h2>Correspondence with Brad Houston</h2>

**3/9/18: Per a conversation today with Rita Grewal (vets.gov privacy officer), we CAN say the application type and number in some cases. It depends on the application. We should be working on this with Rita and the privacy office at this point.**

**Summary**

We CAN say:

* Confirmation number
* Date something was submitted
* Someone's first name

We CAN NOT say:

* The application type
* Application number (eg. 10-10EZ)

Brad recommends we don't say:

* Discharge type, though the VIC team is including copy in emails that mentions people have been discharged with a status that is other than honorable, and this has gotten approval through the appropriate channels.

**2/26/18**

We asked some clarifying questions around why we couldn't say the application type and Brad said:

"  1. I think you could include a neutral label – and I’d say you could include the date (sorry if I implied otherwise.)
   2. There’s not a good resource – it’s not been consistently managed. 
 
The reason I’d go more neutral is because I suspect that if you go neutral in your wording, you can likely get approval in a fairly straightforward fashion.  If you dial it in closer, you will get more resistance. The risk comes when you start revealing information about what may be wrong with the Veteran, and depending on where you pull the data, you may inadvertently reveal things about the medical issues involved... For example, I’d avoid “your claim for increased compensation for your post-traumatic stress disorder...” and if you pull the end product code 024, that’s exactly what it is... L
 
The best bet would be to ask OGC or the Privacy Office for a specific recommendation- and make sure you include the specific legal guidance you got right up front in any discussions with stakeholders."

**2/16/18**

We asked whether you could say:

1. The application type (eg. healthcare, education, disability, etc) and the application number (eg. 10-10EZ)?
2. Confirmation numbers we generate?
3. Someone's discharge status?
4. The date an application was submitted or received?
5. Someone's first name, especially if it's paired with any of the information above?

This is Brad's response:

"I THINK Discharge status, and the fact someone has applied for benefits is protected under the privacy act.  That would imply 1, 3, 4 shouldn’t go in a eComm format, unless we can find a security messaging solution (checkbook please...)
 
That matches the sorts of things I get from my personnel file with VA, my personnel file with DoD, my bank and my doctor.  Brad Houston, we have important information about your benefits, log on to learn more, or Brad Houston, a document has been added to your file, log on to learn more."
