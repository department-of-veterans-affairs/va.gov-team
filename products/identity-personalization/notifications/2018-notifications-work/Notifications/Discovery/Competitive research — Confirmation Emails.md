<h2>General observations</h2>

* All of the emails are full HTML, which personally makes me feel like they look professional and reinforces the brand.
* I DO appreciate when these emails are shorter, though. For example, Amazon's emails are short and sweet, and they seem on the lighter side with HTML.
* HTML does go a long way in helping bring hierarchy to information. I think we could use this sparingly to help bring attention to things like dates, confirmation numbers, etc.
* When HTML does annoy me is when it feels purposeless — like the way DSW just jams photographs into their emails.
* I appreciate when the "small print" copy is a normal, readable font. Obviously, it should be deemphasized hierarchically, but I like when it's readable, especially if there is important info down there. It feels like graying it out and making it super tiny is a problem of trying to fit way too much (potentially) unnecessary stuff in that section.
* Visuals are really helpful when they are meaningful — like showing where you went on an Uber ride, or where your ZocDoc appointment is.
* Standard format seems to show the purpose of the email in large print at the top of the email.
* I went through a ton of emails and couldn't find a single one that was sent entirely in plain text. Even smaller organizations who (I assume) don't have full design teams at least have their logos in their and hyperlinked text. I think we're going to look super JV if we launch with a fully plain-text email. This doesn't mean the design has to be wild, though. I don't see things going much beyond the logo, a clear intro heading, and a button CTA when necessary.


<h2>"Small print" copy</h2>

This is any copy that could (1) appear in many/every email and is agnostic from the specific topic of the email (eg. a sentence about unsubscribing) or (2) is there for some sort of legal reason.

Takeaways

* These types of email don't have an unsubscribe or "manage preferences" links.
* We may want to let users know they can't reply to the email but, if there is someone they can contact with an issue, we should let them know how to get in touch with the appropriate people.
* It seems like a lot of organizations link to their privacy policy, so we should consider this but it's not required.
* We should consider something that confirms this was sent by our team at Vets.gov to make things feel more secure/less suspicious since there are already trust issues between veterans and the VA.
