<h2>Healthcare Application Initial Notes</h2>

Tested with vets.gov.user+0@gmail.com

1. Assuming people go directly to the application: Explore Benefits > Healthcare > Apply Now.
2. User is presented with directions page. 
   * At this point, they may need to go collect various materials they'll need for the application, eg. tax returns.
3. Click **Start the Healthcare Application**.
4. (1) Veteran Information 
   * Name information — Name info is prefilled from, I assume, sign up. Click Continue.
   * Birthdate, SSN, Place of birth. Click Continue.
   * Gender, Marital Status, Race. Click Continue.
   * Permanent Address. Click Continue.
   * Email address and phone number. Click Continue.
5. (2) Military Service — May need DD214 for this
   * Answer basic questions about military service. Click Continue.
   * Service history — check circumstances that applies. Click Continue.
     * As far as I can tell, checking these does not change the flow in any meaningful way.
6. (3) Current Compensation
  * Select compensation they are receiving. Click Continue.
    * Do people always know this? Will this maybe take them out of the flow?
7. (4) Household Information — May need tax return for this.
  * Option to Provide Financial Information
    * Choose Yes
      * Spouse's Information — We can assume this will show or not based on what you choose in Veteran Information. Click Continue.
      * Dependent Information. Click Continue.
        * Yes — Asks for dependent information.
        * No — Click Continue.
      * Annual Income — May need tax return for this. Click Continue.
      * Previous Calendar Year's Deductibles. Click Continue.
    * Choose No. Click Continue and continue to the next section (section 5).
8. (5) Insurance Information
  * Medicaid Information. Click Continue.
  * Other Coverage — Are you covered by health insurance?
    * Yes — Fill out health insurance info. May require people to go gather that. Click Continue.
    * No – Click Continue.
  * VA Facility. Click Continue.
    * "Do you want VA to contact you to schedule an appointment?" — What do we do if someone selects this?
    * There are also a few links here that may take people away from the application.
9. (6) Review Application
  * People may edit info, go back and fill in things/change them later.
10. Submit Application
11. Confirmation page
  * Includes how long they can wait to expect a response, date received, confirmation number, a link to what happens next, and numbers to call. This may be a good opportunity for a notification.

Possible Notification Scenarios

  * On every page, there is a **Finish this Application** later link (which appears on every page). Clicking this saves the application as is and let's users know when the application will expire if it's not completed. A notification may be helpful in this case if people's applications are about to expire.
  * Do people want notifications after they submit the form, assuming everything went OK and we didn't have to wait to submit it?
  * It doesn't look like we have any insight into when a decision is made here since they send a letter informing them of the decision. However, we may want to figure out who is working on implementing electronic decisions at the VA because we may be able to get people electronic notifications for this eventually.

<h2>Education Application</h2>
  
1. Assuming people go directly to the application: Explore Benefits > Education & Training > Apply Now.
2. Education Benefits Application Process (education landing page). 
   * At this point, they may need to go collect various materials they'll need for the application, eg. bank account and direct deposit info.
3. Click **Select Correct Form**. Goes through form selection wizard.
4. **Apply Now** (Regardless of outcome of selection wizard).
5. Directions page (this is customized based on the outcome of the selection wizard and what form they'll be filling out).
6. **Start Education Application**
7. Application
8. Confirmation Page
  * Includes how long they can wait to expect a response, date received, confirmation number, a link to what happens next, and numbers to call. This may be a good opportunity for a notification.
  * Application approval sent via mail. 

Notes

* I didn't do a detailed flow for each form for the sake of time.
* Notification scenarios are the same as healthcare — if people choose to finish the application later and let it get close to expiration, when closing a tab, upon submission.

<h2>Disability Application</h2>

Note: The above submission/reminder/expiration notifications would also apply for the disability application.

* Step 2 in the flow: Review Veteran Details — Opportunity to update their address.
  * This step needs a notification because this update will write back to the VA database.
    * Notification — Asynchronous syncing: Thanks! Got your update, we’ll let you know as soon as it’s updated in VA’s records. OR Uh oh! Our apologies, something went wrong with the transfer to VA’s records. Could you please log in to submit your address change again?
    * Notification — Synchronous syncing: Success! Your address is now up to date in VA’s records.

<h2>Claims & Appeals</h2>

**Claim**

1. Decide they want to look into what they may qualify for re: VA disability benefits.
2. Prob do some research about what they are and determine what you may be eligible to receive, potentially on Vets.gov.
3. Determine they are eligible and want to apply.
4. Go to eBenefits to apply, or go to VSO for help with applying.
5. Apply.
6. Claim is received.
* Potential notification — "Your claim has been received."
  * This may be especially helpful if someone is submitting this on your behalf.
7. Sign in to vets.gov. Go to Manage Your Health & Benefits > Check claim and appeal status. Check for updates.
8. Sign off > Come back to vets.gov periodically to check for status updates > repeat.
  * Potential notification over email — "There is an update on your claim."
  * Potential notification after sign in — "Your claim has been updated", or a more specific message on the actual update.
    * It may not be necessary to get more specific in the notification once they are signed in since they can just see the status change.


**Appeal**

1. A claims decision is received. The veteran decides they want to file an appeal.
2. Offline, they go through the appeals process.
3. Vets.gov updates with appeals information.
4. A veteran periodically signs back into vets.gov to check for status updates.
  * Potential notification over email — "There is an update on your claim."
  * Potential notification after sign in — "Your claim has been updated", or a more specific message on the actual update.
    * It may not be necessary to get more specific in the notification once they are signed in since they can just see the status change.


**Claims Questions**

- When are we launching the disability form on our site?
  * Within in the next couple months.
- When the disability application launches on vets.gov, what is happening to the eBenefits application? Are we in a position to track both and provide updates on both?
  * Disability form will be operating in two places.
  * Login maps people to their entry in the VA database. For the application tools to function, you have to be fully logged in as a veteran. On eBenefits, a third party can login and do all of the applications online and vets.gov doesn't have third party login. Therefore, eBenefits stuff has to stay in place.
  * eBenefits apps and vets.gov apps don't talk to each other in V1.
  * V1 launch is only one specfic type of claim.
- How do we know that someone submits a claim/has claims in progress on eBenefits?  Does it matter if they submit a claim *before* creating a vets.gov account? Are we still able to track people's claims?
  * We have access on vets.gov that has been sent back to the VA's database. So, anything started on eBenefits is accessible on vets.gov. The challenge is most things aren't sent back to vets.gov. Anything that is saved in progress is saved the the API and not to the VA's system.
  * What we do have is ITF — intent to file. Whenever you start a new claim, an ITF is started — it lets the system know that you intend to file and any benefits are backdated to that date.
- How do people learn they can track claims on Vets.gov? Do we know whether that's the same for appeals?
  * You can track on eBenefits, don't have to go to vets.gov
  * There are banners on eBenefits pushing people to vets.gov
  * Social media campaigns
  * May be able to get VSOs to market this for us.
- Do we let people know anything about their claim other than its status (eg. claim received, additional evidence is required, etc)?
  * On eBenefits there are 8 different statuses. We have 5.
  * But yes, we only show statuses here.
- Do we know when people are sent their claims decision?
  * Not sure, but we should recommend this for notifications, but not 100% sure if we have this data point or this is allowed from a policy standpoint.
- What research do we have on the claims process?
  * On Github under claims status, appeals status, and disability compensation.
  * Rachael's main takeaway — extra statuses on eBenefits caused anxiety.


**Appeals Questions**

- How do we track the appeals process? How does our system know someone is in the appeals process?
- I've seen [this page](https://staging.vets.gov/disability-benefits/claims-appeal/), but it is unclear to me exactly what we are updating people about re: their appeals. What kind of information can we give them via vets.gov?
- How are people made aware they can track the appeals process on vets.gov?
- Do we have any analytics on how people track their claims on vets.gov?
- About how often do we think there is an update? Do we think it's likely people would use our site to track appeals if updates maybe come once a year?

<h2>Prescriptions</h2>

**My Questions**

- What happens prior to people tracking prescriptions on Vets.gov? 
- How do prescriptions make it into the prescription list? Does every prescription someone has received through the VA go there? Only certain ones?
- How do people find out they can manage prescriptions from Vets.gov?
- When people sign up for a Vets.gov account, how do people get set up to track prescriptions via Vets.gov? Is there anything special they have to do outside of the website?
- How do people request a refill?
- Do we show anything to indicate that the prescription has been refilled/is ready for pick-up/is out for delivery?
- What does the "Track a Package" section do/show?

Notes from chat with Natalie:

* For additional questions on functionality, regroup with Carnetta.
* All of the vets.gov prescription and messaging functionality depends on people having a MyHealthEVet account and certain things being activated there.
  * For messaging specifically, the medical team is responsible for activating it. If it's active on MyHealthEVet, it's active on vets.gov.
* We already have notifications for when you receive a message and refill shipment notifications, but those are sent by MyHealthEVet. They *do* mention vets.gov, though, and that is how some people have found out about vets.gov (via links we're tracking in that email).
* Re: Prescriptions, anything that is in MyHealthEVet will show in Vets.gov. Prescriptions don't stay in there forever, but we're unsure of how long they stay there for. People do not have to do anything special to get set up to track prescriptions on vets.gov.
* There is a request a refill button in the UI.
* Track a package show UPS information. We don't send any delivery notifications — all of the tracking and related notifications would come from UPS. UPS and there systems are often updated faster than the data that shows up in MyHealthEVet (and, therefore, vets.gov).


**Notable UX**

From what I can tell, people can:

- View their current prescriptions that are in the refill process.
- View the status of prescriptions in general.
  - Active
  - Discontinued
  - Expired
  - Active – Hold
  - Active – Suspended
  - Unknown
- View the status and updates of prescriptions in the refill process.
  - In process (being reviewed by the pharmacist)
  - Submitted (not sure, but I think this just means someone has requested a refill)
- View detailed information on a prescription
- Send a message to your healthcare provider (more on that below)
- Track a package

<h2>Messaging</h2>

**My Questions**

- Who is being messaged? It looks like there is a set list of people since the "To" field is a dropdown.
- Are messages intended to be used for things besides prescriptions? 
- To confirm, we don't send people emails now when they receive a message...?

**Notable UX**

From what I can tell, people can:

- Send messages to their healthcare team.
- Receive messages from their healthcare team.
- Manage their inbox and past correspondence.

**Notification thoughts**

- We should send people a notification when they have a new message. Since the message may contain PII, we may only be able to tell people that they have received something in the inbox but not include the contents of the message.


<h2>Provide Feedback on Vets.gov</h2>

1. Click **Provide feedback on vets.gov**.
2. Fill out feedback
3. System shows a list of potential topics that may be related to yours.
4. Either click into a post or select Skip and post idea.
5. Select title, category, and email address.
6. Post idea.
7. System shows confirmation and link to feedback forum.

From here, as far as I can tell, there is nothing that confirms your post besides the confirmation message that shows after you immediately post. There's no way to tell where you go to follow along on your post (the linkt to the forum diappeared quickly) or to know whether you should expect a response on your post.

That being said, it's not clear if we really need to be heavy handed on notifications here. I'd tend to side with the leaner approach of the current UX — confirm that you've received the feedback and let people from our team get in touch as necessary. Would be interesting to test expectations here.

<h2>Sign up</h2>

<h4>Create an ID.me Account</h4>

* On Vets.gov, go to Sign in/Sign Up.
* Choose Create an ID.me account.
* Enter email address and password.
* **Notification**: ID.me emails a confirmation code.
* Enter confirmation code on vets.gov.
* **Notification**: Welcome email from ID.me.
* Choose whether you would like to enable two factor authentication.
  * If yes, choose what type of two-factor auth you want, and then enter additional info.
  * If no, select No, I do not want to secure my account at this time.
* Go to vets.gov homepage.

Potential notification opportunity from vets.gov — An additional email from us saying Welcome to Vets.gov and giving them an overview of the account. However, this starts to feel like A LOT of emails. Some sort of FTUX flow when they sign in to vets.gov my be a better experience.
