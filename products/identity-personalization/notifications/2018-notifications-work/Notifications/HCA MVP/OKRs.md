<h2>OKRs</h2>

<h4>Background</h4>

* There is no way to keep veterans informed about the status of their applications and benefits that are tracked on vets.gov without requirng that they log in to vets.gov.
* Vets.gov does not accept the submission of applications if VA databases are down, which might mean people fill out an application only to not be able to submit it.
* Calls to VA call centers about claims status account for a large percentage of their calls, even though this information is trackable online. (source?)
* Veterans request greater transparency into where their applications are in processing.
* Veterans want to know what they are eligible for with regards to benefits, and they want us (the VA) to inform them of that.

<h4>Objectives</h4>

* Establish foundation for vets.gov external notification system.

<h4>Key Results</h4>

* Vets.gov allows healthcare applications to be submitted synchronously or asynchronously. For applications with no validation errors, 100% of applications are received, resulting in zero failed submissions.
* Vets.gov successfully generates 100% of confirmation emails (via a third-party tool) when the healthcare application is submitted and received.
* 98% of confirmation emails are received and not marked as SPAM (98% is cited as [GovDelivery's success rate](https://insights.govdelivery.com/Communications/CommunicationsCloud/Getting_Started/Deliverability). 

Note: In this first phase, we are not evaluating success based on user metrics, but we will do this in the future.
