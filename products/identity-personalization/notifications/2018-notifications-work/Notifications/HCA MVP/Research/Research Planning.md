# Planning Issue Template

## Why

**1. What product are we testing?**

We are building an MVP to test external notifications (eg. email) for vets.gov. For this initial MVP we are specifically testing a confirmation email which will be sent when the healthcare application (HCA) is submitted.

**2. Goals: what do we want to know? Why do you want us to do this research?**

We want to know:

* Whether new copy on the HCA submission confirmation page make sense.
* How users react to a new email confirmation for HCA submission:
  * Do they want this email?
  * Does the content make sense?
  * Is the content relevant? Is there anything missing or anything we should take out?
  * How do users react to a plain text email?
* General behavior around notifications:
  * How notifications might have been helpful in their previous experiences applying for benefits at the VA.
  * What other notifications may be useful to people on vets.gov.
  * What kind of notifications are perceived as noise/annoying.
  * How people prefer to receive notifications.
  * Whether this population would like notifications via text message.

Why we want to do this research:

* To better understand people's needs and expectations around notifications on vets.gov.
* To understand the utility of a confirmation email for HCA submission.
* To gain insights that will help us implement vets.gov's first external notification, which will serve as the foundation for implementing notifications sitewide over time.


**3. Primer: what is the background on this question? What would a new person on the team need to know about this page/section/benefit/question?** 

What a new person might need to know:

* External (email/text/anything that leaves vets.gov) do not currently exist on vets.gov.
* In order for people to get updates on claims & appeals, prescription, or messaging, they have to sign into vets.gov. We have no way to send them an email/text to them know there is an update on any one of these things. 
* In VIC 2.0 testing, people noted that they wanted a confirmation email that their application had been received.
* VA call centers get a significant amount of questions about the status of people's claims, and often the answer is that there is no update. Notifications could potentially reduce the number of calls the call center gets about this.

**4. Universe of possibilities: what can be changed as a result of this research? What cannot be touched? What are the sensitivities around this question?**

* This project aims to serve as the foundation for external notifications across vets.gov. This research will give us insight into user needs around a specific notification flow (HCA submission) as well as give us an opportunity to gather information around users's general needs and expectations when it comes to notifications.

**5. Success: what information will you want to have from this testing? What knowledge will make you feel like the research process has been successful? Is task completion time important**

We will feel like the research was successful if we gain valuable insight into:

* How users perceive the HCA submission flow/confirmation email we've designed, and any feedback we can get to improve this design.
* Users' general needs and expectations when it comes to notifications:
  * How notifications might have been helpful in their previous experiences applying for benefits at the VA.
  * What other notifications may be useful to people on vets.gov.
  * What kind of notifications are perceived as noise/annoying.
  * How people prefer to receive notifications.
  * Whether this population would like notifications via text message.

## When

**5. Urgency: is there a deadline by which we would like to complete this research?** 

There is no hard deadline, but we're hoping to begin this research in early March and finish it by mid March if possible.

**6. Availability: when would you like sessions scheduled?**
*Please list exact dates and times.*

* Weekdays starting March 1 — March 15 (I'm out on the 16th), though we'd like to fit in as much of this as we can on/before March 9th if subject availability will allow.
* Hours 9 – 6, except on the 15th (I'll be leaving around 4). 
  * Testing takes priority over meetings so let's not worry about trying to schedule around meetings.

*Research team scheduling policies:*

- *Issues should be submitted for recruiting at least 2 weeks before desired start date*
- *No more than 3 hours of research in one day*
- *No more than 2 consecutive hours of research*

*Please request enough dates and time slots accordingly*.

**7. Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your conversation guide.**

* Feb 27 or 28.

**8. Please indicate a date after sessions are completed for a debrief.**

* March 12, if research ends by March 9.
* March 19, if research ends by March 15.

## Who

### Participants and Recruitment

**9. Participant criteria: what are you looking for in a participant?**

Please be as specific as possible. ex. What benefits do they use? How often do they go online? How often do they use VA services online?

* About 10 participants, to allow for no-shows. We hope to speak to no fewer than 5 by the end of the research phase.
* At least 1 woman veteran.
* At least 1 person 35 or under.
* Vets who have applied for healthcare, education, or disability benefits within the VA. This could have been on vets.gov, eBenefits, or by paper.
* Have their own email account and use it some what regularly.
* Have a phone on which they can check email and send/receive text messages.
* Vets who have used vets.gov in some capacity, or at least have heard, of it are preferred but not required. This is so we're not answering lots of "what is this?" questions.

**10. Recruitment: In addition to pulling from the Cohorts database, are there other places (facebook groups, meetups, stakeholders, etc.) or people we should contact to find participants specific to this project?**

**11. Will the sessions be remote, in-person, or mix?**

* Remote.

### Who's involved and how?
