## First Task: Evaluate HCA submission confirmation page - 5 minutes

Let's pretend today that you are applying for healthcare on Vets.gov. You can navigate to the healthcare application now [Note: navigating to the application is not a task we are evaluating, so it's OK to help them get there if they are having trouble.]

Now you're on a page that says "Apply for health care benefits" at the top. It looks like you already have an application started, so go ahead and continue that application.

[On "Fast Forward" page] Before we continue, let's pretend that you've already filled out most of this application in previous sittings and you're just here today to submit the application. This screen you are looking at not is part of Vets.gov and is only trying to communicate that today in testing we are just here to submit the application. Do you have any question before we continue? OK, you may click anywhere to go to the next screen.

You'll notice now that we are back in the Vets.gov application flow. You are on a page where you can review your application. You may review it as you see fit, and then please submit the application. 

Now we're looking at a page that says "Apply for Healthcare — Form 10-10EZ" at the top:

1. What is this page trying to communicate?
2. What would you expect to happen next?
3. What would you do next?
4. (If not already mentioned) I'd like to draw your attention to the part of this page that says, "If your application didn't go through, well also send you an email letting you know."
  * Did you notice that before I mentioned it?
  * What do you think this is trying to communicate?
  * Why do you think there is a chance your application may not go through?
  * How does this make you feel?
  * (If applicable) How could we better answer your questions/assuage your concerns on this page?

Alright, please scroll down and click into the white space below "Need Help?"

## Second Task: Evaluate the failure email — 5 minutes

Before we continue, let's pretend again that we've jumped forward in time a couple of days and you're viewing an email you just received from the VA. Any questions before we continue?

Alright, now we're looking at that email I mentioned:

1. What is this email trying to communicate?
2. Does this email match your expectations of what would happen if an application of yours failed to go through?
3. What questions does this email leave you with, if any?
  * How would you go about getting answers to those questions?
4. How does this email make you feel?
5. What would you do next?
6. Would you say this email is helpful/useful or not helpful/useful? Why or why not?
  * (If applicable) How can we make this email more helpful and useful for veteran's whose applications may not go through?
