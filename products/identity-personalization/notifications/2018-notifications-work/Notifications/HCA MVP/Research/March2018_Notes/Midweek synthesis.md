# SNAPSHOT FINDINGS, USER NOTIFICATIONS

How do people feel about:

- Emails

  - Participants seem to like two forms of communication: an email immediately, then a letter behind it
  - The longer the delay in receiving the email, the more likely it is to be suspicious. A few hours is ok, a few days is not.
    - This effect is augmented by the non-.gov sender
  - They should be short, direct, and to the point; say what they are in the subject line and be useful.
    - Most useful emails: "Those are the most useful:
      the things that you set up to keep your life on schedule and confirm the things
      you set up to be automated are actually occurring." (P2)
  - The prototype email:
    - "Gives you information with
      the date you submitted it on, it gives you the confirmation number, all good
      stuff for future reference, if you gotta start asking questions, then
      it gives you the information of who to contact someone if you have those
      questions, and it gives you a working time when you can reach someone to talk
      about those questions. And it also tells you what to do after you get your
      decision. So. Yeah. Very good, very useful email." (P2)

- Text messages

  - Less excitement here, unless they have the ability to respond in brief or if it's just a nudge that doesn't require action (ie an appointment reminder)
  - Seen as less secure

- VA communication in general

  - Very important to have a clear sense of timeline and expectations about future communication from VA
    - This includes tracking both the application processing timeline and shipping of physical objects
  - Users want the site to protect them from the pitfalls and disorganization of the VA - e.g., calling in Jan to set up April appoint for annual checkup - told has to wait till June, why wasn't this scheduled automatically and tracked, or notified of the time sentitivity here? (Ben's observation)
  - Every participant would print or take a screenshot of the confirmation page

- Other electronic capabilities

  - Secure website like MHV to be able to check on application status on their own time
  - From Voc Rehab: prefill and electronic DD214 are preferable

*Session takeaways*

- Ben:
  Confirmation # and expected timeline number huge
  User prefers eligibility yes / no as opposed to filling out full form and rejection weeks or months later
  Content was an opportunity to teach *user learned about hours of operation for help department
  Put decision for claim at top of letter!!!
  User prefers eligibility yes / no as opposed to current process (filling out full form and rejection weeks or months later)

- Mel:

  Confirmation page — most interested in confirmation # and "what happens after you apply" link
  Expected "Find out what to do next" link in both the confirmation page and email would take her to a status page, tell her when it'll be approved or show the decision if it's ready
  Prefers email over paper copy, but might be a good idea to have the option to receive a paper copy as well. Felt text message was less secure than both, higher concern for the wrong person receiving or seeing it.
  Quote: "VA says the same thing 5 different times in 5 different ways, or speak legal jargon no one can understand"



- Mike
  - • From the confirmation email, he thought he was going to get both a phone call and a letter in the mail about the decision (but didn't seem to notice the nuance that he'd only get a call if the application is approved) 
    • Thought processing claims within a week was very good timing
    • Didn't have major concerns about the email address, but if he were questioning it, he'd click on the name to see if it has another email address under it. Also mentioned the "dotgov" being written out rather than ".gov" as notable, but he overall said "I think I would trust it" (edited)
- Mel
  - Overall preferred to receive communications from the VA by mail or phone rather than email or text message, but wasn’t surprised and still liked being able to get the email.
  - Liked having two forms of communication on a given thing, e.g. getting both an email and a letter.
  - Didn’t seem concerned about the govdelivery email address, trusted that it was most likely legitimate because the email content matched the action he’d just performed.



- Lauren:

  - The correlation between how long it takes to receive the email and what the tail end of the email is (.com or .gov) matters. If it comes 2 days later from a .com instead of a .gov, he doesn't trust it.
  - Short. Sweet. To the point. What he expects, when he expects it. Those were the things that he felt made for a good notification, and it didn't really matter if it came via text or email. Both were welcome.
  - It actually sounded like the VA did communicate with him a lot during even his most frustrating application process, just via mail instead of phone/email. The frustration seemed to come more from the hassle of having to do a lot in person and over the phone, when he felt that more could be electronic.

  ​

- Ben:
  Gov-delivery sender address is a potential trust barrier
  Amazon (and immediacy - within hours) is the standard by which this and other users have compared expectations for digital engagement
  Users want the site to protect them from the pitfalls and disorganization of the VA - e.g., calling in Jan to set up April appoint for annual checkup - told has to wait till June, why wasn't this scheduled automatically and tracked, or notified of the time sentitivity here?





- Ben
  - Text preferred method of communication
  - Would like a place to view the content again outside of email (where it might get lost)
  - Would like to tracking so can know when to schedule appointment (medical supplies -> received -> schedule appointment)
