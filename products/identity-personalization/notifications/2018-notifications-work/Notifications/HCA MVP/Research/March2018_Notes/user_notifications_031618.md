# User notification research
## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 2 minutes

* Can you tell me a little bit about yourself? 
  * "I was in the military back in the dark ages for 4 years…after that I was a 911 discharger…and now I'm home goofing off and it's kind of glorious. I have lots of time to play on the computer! [laughing]"
  * "Oh, I'm everywhere, I have a couple of blogs that I follow…I do a lot of reasearch…I've written a book about a year ago…I have a master's degree that I did online…I like to travel; we went to Europe last year which was a hoot. I have a service dog, I did a lot of research on him! I've becoming an internet junkie since I've been off work."
  * "I'm an equal opportunity rabbit-hole…I can spend hours on the computer these days! My husband thinks I'm an addict!"
* Manage VA benefits online?
  * "Yes, eBenefits…and that's pretty much it. Mostly the compensation stuff. I was tracking my packages there. I don't do VA medical care. I've done appointments on there…mostly it was just following through on my disability claim."

- Have you ever used Vets.gov before?
  - "VA.gov, Vets.gov? I am not sure. Oh! This one! Yeah, no. This one came online after I was already done screwing around with the stuff I was working with."
  - "Oh, this must be the one that transferred over from eBenefits. Because isn't that the idea, that this takes over eBenefits?"



## First Task: Evaluate HCA submission confirmation page - 5 minutes

1. What is this page trying to communicate?

  * "I'm applying for healthcare, you've received my claim. If I was trying to do both my healthcare and compensation claims, that might be confusion — if I click on that did it then shunt me to this page, or are you shunting me to this page to start?" Thought it was looking at the disability package.
  * "Can I click on what happens after I apply?" "I think you've already answered those questions…well I guess it would be, I've filed my claim…what's going to happen next? How am I going to get to my confirmation?…that would probably be my first question. Who do I call if I don't hear something back? When do I find out, what do I do when I find out, and what happens if I don't find out?"

2. Is there anything you would do next, or are you finished with this process?

   * "I think you'd be done here, after clicking [what happens when you apply]"

   * Doesn't seem to be familiar with the iOS notifications interface — does she receive emails on her phone? 

     * "yeah so I would read this if it came across on my phone, I'd read it as you're just acknowledging me but I don't need to [actually read the e-mail]." Does receive notifications about e-mail and it looks like this, but still thinks the notification would be a point of confusion — especially if you have a smartphone. It's the persistence of the notification in the prototype that's confusing.

     ​

## Second Task: Evaluate new HCA submission confirmation email - 10 minutes

If you can, please click anywhere on this screen. If I can draw your attention to the top of the page, you'll see you have a new email from Vets.gov. Please click that notification, and let's take a look at the email.

1. What is this email trying to communicate?

   * Yeah so this answers the next set of question: I've applied, and…I wonder if I would want to know the part about it being a week before I actually hit submit my packet." … "I think it might be…the word that comes to mind is more reassuring that I'm going to put this in and it's not going to be somethign that gets lost and then I get an email that it'll be ready for a week…." Suggests it in the beginning and then following up with repeittion in the email.

2. Why is the VA sending you this email?

   * "Just as a confirmation."

3. What would you do if you had follow-up questions about your application?

   * "I would call [the phone number in the e-mail]." 
   * "If i knew it was going to be a week I'd wait a week. So I'd probably call on day 8! [laughing]"
   * "I like [the indicator that you can download from the website] because you can access it immediately." When she went through her disability claim, she didn't get the VHB handbook until after the whole claim had gone through.

4. Would you say this email is useful or not useful? Why or why not?

   1. "Oh yeah, I like getting it and getting that confirmation…I think the only thing that needs to be added is some kind of information about what you can expect…that there's going to be some kind of follow-through, some kind of date. I'm kind of wondering if some people wouldn't process it…you throw things out to the VA website now and you [have no expectatoin of when it's going to come back]…this e-mail I like because [it's a recap of the conversation] and now you can follow-through with the next set of instructions."

5. I'd like to draw your attention to the top of the page to the email address that sent this email — vetsdotgov@public.govdelivery.com. What do you think "public.govdelivery.com" is? 

  * "Not a clue."


  * Would you trust an email coming from this address?
    * "Now that you point it out to me, I don't know. Because it's…ok so here we're jumping from what I would think to what my dad would think because I beat into his head [don't open spam or if you don't know where it's coming from]" — it's vets.gov, but the domain doesn't match (govdelivery.com). "If I got this e-mail directly after submitting my claim, I wouldn't think twice about it. If this email came a day or so later, I might wonder if it's spam."
    * If it's been several hours, "I might look twice at it before I opened it. Because I didn't notice it the first time [it being the email address]"

6. After submitting an application like the healthcare application, would you expect to receive an email like this?

   1. "Yes, confirmation."
   2. Would file it in her "stuff from the VA" folder. It's in her e-mail at home and her dropbox folder.

7. How long after you hit "submit" would you expect to receive this email?

  * Pretty much immediately. "Just because that's what I get with everything else when I submit something."

## Third Task: General questions about notification expecations and needs - 20 — 30 minutes

Thanks for sharing your thoughts on this email. Next, I'd like to close this screen and just ask you some questions.

- What benefits applications have you submitted to the VA?
  - Just disability. Healthcare was done for her when she was submitting for disability compensation.
- After you'd submitted that application, did you feel like you knew what to expect next? How did the VA keep you informed about progress and next steps? 
  - "Not a clue! [laughing]. I worked with a VSO through the whole thing. One of the biggest problems…there were four different VA kind of websites [eBen, MHV, VA.gov] and it was hard to figure out which one had which information. Also because I was really stressed when I was filing it, going back now and looking at it I could probably sort it out. Bu it was very very confusing when I was filling it out. There kept being all these little disclaimers [about eben not having all the info]…so I couldn't log in and see did you get the last peice of paper you'd asked for? Sometimes they wanted it mailed and sometimes they wanted it uploaded. The website didn't match what was actually going on in the background, and that was really frustrating."
  - [If applicable] How could they have kept you informed better?
    - "Either if there was a cleaner version online would be good…I worked iwth a VSO and they were able tokeep me better update. I did ask why did they have information about me that I didn't have. That was a big question — that they could log in and see stuff but I couldn't log in and see stuff. A promtper system. As soon as it's uploaded ot the VA it should be uploaded to eBen at the same time. And eBen is down _a lot._ I logged into it this morning and it was donw! That does not instill confidence! [laughing]"
  - [If not already answered] Through what mean of communication would you have preferred the VA use to communicate with you in this process? This could be mail, phone, email, text messages, or anything else you can think of.
    - So I filed three different times. The first time I did it completely through a VSO. I took her papers and she did everything, and then she communicated with me for the VA. The second time I uploaded some of my own documentation and other people uploaded documentation. It would have been nice to get some kind of confimration each stime something was uploaded. They were gathering information from so many different sources that I never knew what they were waiting for. So that was frustrating. 
    - E-mail would have been fine. "Your file's been updated, that I can go and click an on and see what's been updated. It seems like the eBen stie runs about 7-10 days behind."
    - "There's been an update to your eBenefts, please log on, and then a link that takes me to what's bee updated. It's kind of like when you order something online and they ship it to you, they send you an e-mail saying your product has shipped [and they send you a tracking link.]"
- In what other ways besides submitting applications have you interacted with the VA? 
  - "I've done most of it by phone. Because the websites are so hard to navigate."
  - "Mostly scheduling appointments, finding updates. I use the VSO to get updates on my claim."
- How could the VA have kept you better informed or communicated more efficiently with you in these interactions?
  - "Yeah, so [laughing] right now when I schedule an appointment I get a letter in the mail, and I also get a voicemail telling me that I have an appointment. The vm usually comes two days before the appointment does. The letter comes anywhere from two or three days ahead of time to [a few days afterwards]. But there is no e-mail option. It would be nice to have an e-mail or even a text. One of my doctors sends out text messages."
  - "The mail part woudl be fine except for the part that it's super erratic. I don't know how many times I've opened my mailbox and there's a letter two days after my appointment. I've never sucessfully scheduled a dr's appt online. I want to say that's because I started to and it's just a pain in the ass so I called. If they had an easier way to schedule an appointment, get a confirmation, get a reminder, either through e-mail or text. I know you're dealing with a lot of older vets and I'm thinking of my dad…he would need a phone call to remind him of his appts coming up."
  - Her dentists asks for notification preferences when they go in.
  - [If not already answered] Through what mean of communication would you have preferred to communicate with the VA in this process? This could be mail, phone, email, text messages, or anything else you can think of.
    - E-mail, text or phone call are her preferred options. "Save the trees!"
    - Someone might sign up for more than one, that should be an option. Mail should also be an option because her dad doesnt' text or touch omputers or cell phones. So we should have hte option AND the ability to opt out. "**IF** it came at the right time!"
  - Looking again at the email, would have liked to receive this information as a text message as well. Asks if there's information in case she wants to call.
- In addition to everything we just talked about, is there any other correspondence that you can think of that would be helpful from the VA?
  - "Um…no I think those are the four — email text phone and mail….I don't know if this exists already, but what would be really nice fi I need to schedule an appt is to click on my dr's name and have her calendar comes up. This is what Kaiser does — they give you a list of available appointments and you pick on [on their website]."
  - "It woudl be really nice to get a text or an email that says your claim is copleted. When I got my claim there was a message that came across eBen that said her claim had been closed…" but had no further info. When she called, she was told it had been decided but she needed to wait 7-10 days for the mail.  "So that made me cranky." 
  - Eventually eBenefits updated wiht her rating changed. "They're looking at the computer, they've got my informaton, and they won't tell me what it says because I have to wait for the mail. I would have liked something like a text or an email saying your claim hs been decided, click here for the results."

Now I'd like to ask you some questions about emails and other correspondence you might receive currently from companies or organizations other than the VA.

- I'd like you to think of the emails you currently receive. Other than personal emails from people you know, what kinds of emails do you get?
  - "I have a great spam filter! If it' snot osmthing that I've already comunicated with it geos to spam. I dont' usually open emails that aren't from somebody [I haven't communicated with]"
  - Gets e-mail from her dr, dentist, groups she's in. Gets updates…"I'm in a French program that sends me updates", plus her Fitbit, gets stuff from her dr reminding her of appts or test results are in, same with the dentist. "God, what else do I get? That's pretty much it. I'm pretty…I play a lot on the internet, but I don't give out my infromation a lot. I actually have a spam email address and that's what I give to random people who migh tbe emailing me…if I'm logging in, I give them the spam folder."
- Of the emails you just mentioned [list a couple examples], which of these do you find useful? What kind of emails do you usually ignore, or wish you didn't get?
  - "I've got one company that I buy stuff from that sends me sales…usually I just delete them, but sometimes I look at them so I keep them. I'm looking for information that applies specifically to me….if it doesn't apply to me I don't care."
- What makes you pay attention to an email that you receive from a company or organization?
  - "First off who it's from, and then what's in the message line. What are you contacting me for?"
  - "I just got one today from a company that I buy CBD oil from, and it said hi Kelly, we're having a 50% off sale! [laughing] That I'd open!" Would also open appt reminders. Wants to know she's not being sold to unless she's specifically asked for it. Something that's going to give her a reason to open the email. "People get so indundated with e-mails today that that part is critical: how is this email going to apply to me?"
- Is there a company or organization that you've interacted with in the past that you think does a great job of user notifications? If yes... what company, what do they do, how frequently, what format, how much info, etc.... If no, can you think of a company or organization that you think does a terrible job of user notifications...
  - Kaiser does an excellent job. "They've had some growing pains, but in the past year they've [done a great job] at [sending e-mails with purposes.]" Other crappy companies she's already deleted.
- What do you find annoying or unhelpful in these emails, or about receiving these emails?
  - "wasting my time, nonsense, making me read ot the end and then wondering why…it has nothing to do to me."
  - Something flagged as urgent that turns out to be a sales pitch. When the subject line makes sense, but the e-mail is incomprehensible. 
  - "I'm big into short, concise e-mails. If…it's more than 3, 4 lines, there'd better be a reason for it."
  - The insurance company she's working for with her disability always sends a cover page that says her name and address, and it makes her crazy because they send her so much paperwork, and it's so much paperwork that has nothing to do with her. "It's just a blank piece of paper! For some reason it irritates the crap out of me." Some part of it is the stress factor. "I'm already stressed when I open it. Make it simple."
  - "If you're sending me semthing about my benefits..disability…heatlhcare, it needs to be short, sweet and to the point. And then a contact number if I have any questions."
  - Likes how Kaiser sets up appointments — you used to have to get on hold and go through phone trees. They've changed to an app that auth's with fingerprints…prompts to pick doctor, shows schedule and type of appointment, you select and you're done. "You can actually schedule an appointment with them in less than five minutes, and that has been really impresive. And they do the same thing with their prescriptions."
  - Kaiser doesn't send her alerts that her script is running out, but they'll tell her when she can re-order them when she looks it up. She doesn't get any kind of tracking when it's shipped, but she can get online and look. Does it through an app but it's also availble on the website.
  - "I really like the phone appts and the video appointments…[they've been] fabulous. I don't have to drag my butt down to the doctor and sit there for two hours for a fifteen minute appointment. ANd I like the fingerprint…I'm finding that I really like that."
    - Likes the convenience factor, plus it's harder to break in if she loses her phone. Extra level of security. 



Thank-you through Amazon, same email as has been in use.
