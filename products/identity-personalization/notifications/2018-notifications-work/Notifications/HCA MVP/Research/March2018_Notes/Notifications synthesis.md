What do our users feel makes a good email?

- Short (5/5 participants)
  - "They tell me what I want and when I need it. Short, sweet, to the point is the best way to put it. They tell me what I need to know, when I need to know it." (P2)
  - "I'm already stressed when I open it. Keep it simple." (P5)
- Personal (3/5 participants)
  - "I'm looking for information that applies specifically to me….if it doesn't apply to me I don't care." (P5)
- Timely (3/5 participants)
  - "Say it's a group like an adaptive sports program that I've applied for, or a day of--like recently we had something for snowshoes for an adaptive ski weekend that I'm looking forward to, so of course that's one thing that I'm going to be looking for. And often it says hey you've been accepted or something like that." (P4)
- Reassuring (3/5 participants)
  - "Those are the most useful: the things that you set up to keep your life on schedule and confirm the things you set up to be automated are actually occurring." (P2)

What makes an annoying email?

- Too general or promotional (5/5 participants)
  - "I guess the ones that they send me when there's a road closures those are helpful. If it was limited strictly to Lynchburg, not Roanoke because I don't need to know about road closures in Roanoke." (P4)
  - "Spam is just spam, it's useless in most cases. If you've ever done a job search, you know what I'm talking about. Post resume on monster or career builder and whoever subscribes to CareerBuilder and gives them money has access to [your information]...It's the same email every month. It's kinda like the shotgun, it's not a precision instrument. It's a wide blast." (P2)
- Too frequent (5/5 participants)
  - "Amazon is pretty good, but like I said they might go overboard. eHarmony goes overboard. Indeed is borderline. There's some days that they're great and there are some days that I'm like stop it. The local news channel way too much because they are literally sending like every time one country sneezes kind of thing." (P4)


- Too long (4/5 participants)
  - "The newsletters that have the content of the story right there in the newsletter because I have to scroll all the way down through it to get to the next one…if by the second or third I'm not interested I'm usually deleting the e-mail by then." (P1)

How long is too long to wait for an email?

- A few minutes is preferable. A few hours is understandable. A day or two is suspicious.
  - 1/5 participants said they would not mind the email taking a day or two to arrive, since that's how long the mail would take to arrive. (This is the only participant who has worked as a VSO in the past.)
- This effect is augmented by a non-.gov sender.
  - "While I would expect this email, and if it came in conjunction with the application I submitted like we were just talking about a few minutes ago, if it came within a couple minutes, I would be more trusting of it, but if it showed up 2 days later with an address like that, then I might be a little bit more cautious or skeptical of its contents and uh, clicking on any of the links." (P2)
  - 4/5 participants mentioned mistrust of the non-.gov sender. For two of the participants, this mistrust would be lessened if the email arrived immediately after the application was submitted, and increased if the email arrived several hours or days later.

How do our participants feel about text messages?

- Participants are open to text messages under certain circumstances.
  - Reminders 
    - "I don't need a lot. If I have an appointment or an upcoming apt, throw me a text to remind me of that. If there's a new feature on your website that I should check out or I might have an interest in checking out, throw me an email or text on that." (P2)
  - The ability to respond in brief, or no response needed
    - "It's much more difficult to type with your fingers on a phone than on a laptop or a PC." (P3)
    - "It would be really nice to get a text or an email that says your claim is completed." (P5)
  - As a secondary means of communication in addition to an email or phone call
     - "Everyone's text message notification is always turned on and they're usually not too far away from their phone; that application can be seen. Versus e-mail, the notification isn't always on or you have to click in through a certain app to even see it…text message seems to be more immediate. Prompt, boom, right there and you're getting a notification...I'd be open to receive in addition to the e-mail, but not the full content. The shortened, condensed version." (P1)
- Participants have some concerns about text messages
  - Some see texts as less secure
    "If God forbid the number is sent the wrong you know 2 numbers are skewed or they hit fat fingered things, that's why I can easily do. If that text message got sent to somebody that it shouldn't now they potentially have your information and can come back and try… for identify theft I wouldn't trust it." (P4)
  - Harder to go between media (computer, tablet, phone) so harder to pull up when needed
    - "I know you can save a text message, but it's easier to access email from multiple venues. You can do it from a tablet. You can do it from your desktop. You can do it from your cell phone. If you have googled, if you go to another computer and log in at a public, you can still access your information. A text message is stove piped into your phone, and god forbid if you lose your phone or if it gets broken, do you lose that text message? Do you have ability to retain it? I don't know." (P2)
- 2 participants (P3 and P4, oldest participant and youngest participant) said NO to text messaging, 2 (P1 and P5, women in mid-range of ages) said YES enthusiastically, 1 (P2, Army veteran in middle of age range) said YES BUT - as long as texts are specific and don't require a long response. 

How does the prototype email fare?

- All [5] participants said they would call the phone number if they had questions.
  - With one caveat: participant 4 noted previous frustration with delay in receiving help through the phone number and having to wait 2-3 business days to get a response.
- The email was expected and seen as a good recap and confirmation of submission.
- Participants understood that they should wait a week before calling.
- All [5] participants said they saw the email as useful, because:
  - "It tells you the thing you started is being carried through" (confirmation)
  - "If you gotta start asking questions, then it gives you the information of who to contact someone if you have those questions, and it gives you a working time when you can reach someone to talk about those questions" (actionable)
  - "Everything's here in one spot, in a condensed form, and it's detailing exactly what I saw in the previous prompt along with some additional information" (succinct)
  - "Gives you information with the date you submitted it on, it gives you the confirmation number, all good stuff for future reference, if you gotta start asking questions, then it gives you the information of who to contact someone if you have those questions, and it gives you a working time when you can reach someone to talk about those questions. And it also tells you what to do after you get your
    decision. So. Yeah. Very good, very useful email." (P2)
- Email was seen as the only means of electronic or physical communication that would be accessible from anywhere: on a mobile device, on a public computer, or a personal computer. Participants said they would like to be able to access the information in the email wherever they were, rather than having to laboriously search through text messages or risk misplacing a letter.
  - "Yeah, so [laughing] right now when I schedule an appointment I get a letter in the mail, and I also get a voicemail telling me that I have an appointment. The voicemail usually comes two days before the appointment does. The letter comes anywhere from two or three days ahead of time to [a few days afterwards]. But there is no e-mail option." (P5)

How could the VA communicate better in general?

- Very important to have a clear sense of timeline and expectations about future communication from VA
  - This includes tracking both the application processing timeline and shipping of physical objects
  - "Keeping people informed is a good way to lower expectations, or lower anxiety." (P2)
  - Amazon is the standard for tracking shipments; 2 participants mentioned wanting to be able to track shipments of durable medical supplies as they were in route, and 3 of 5 mentioned wanting to be able to track claims and applications in a similar format.
    - "If I could easily go on MHV and click on 'durable medical supply process' and just see that the doctor order > sent to manufacturer > manufacturer sent to hospital > hospital received > clinic received > follow up appt. Something of that nature." (P1)
- Align notifications with a centralized place online where Veterans can get updates on claims status, prescriptions, shipments of durable medical goods, etc. at their convenience. 
  - [After placing an order] "And they [Amazon] do that -- what do I use most-- they send the emails and then they also send the text message through their website if you have their app on the phone. You get internal popups that way." (P2)
  - P5 admires how Kaiser keeps her updated on her appointments and prescriptions online. (paraphrasing) Kaiser doesn't send her alerts that her script is running out, but they'll tell her when she can re-order them when she looks it up. She doesn't get any kind of tracking when it's shipped, but she can get online and look. Does it through an app but it's also availble on the website.
  - P2's dream of an ideal appointment scheduling system: "Allowing me if I need to change my appointment, to go back into MHV and reschedule my appointment, or there is a cancellation that pops up that says 'We suddenly have an appointment available on Friday at 2pm. Would you be interested in coming in?' It gives me the ability to respond to that yes or no, and it somehow manually reschedules my appointment from 3 weeks from now to that. That would be great."
- Every participant would print or take a screenshot of the confirmation page.

Some things the VA is already doing that Veterans appreciate in other avenues:
- The ability to order and track prescriptions online
- The ability to communicate quickly with their health care providers online
