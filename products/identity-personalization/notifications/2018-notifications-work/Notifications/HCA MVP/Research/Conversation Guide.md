# Conversation Guide — HCA MVP Testing

[**Prototype**](https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/share/QYFXJH6RVNE#/screens/279927642_01-Home)

## GoToMeeting logistics

*In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute*

*In the Audio section, click the drop-down arrow and make sure "Play Entry/Exit Chimes" is unchecked*

*When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*

## Goals

1. To better understand expectations around receiving a confirmation email for benefit applications.
2. To evaluate the content in an application submission confirmation email for clarity and utility.
3. To better understand general preferences around receiving notifications.
4. To determine where else in the veteran journey digital notifications might be useful and helpful.
5. To determine whether text message notifications may be a good fit for this audience.

## We will know we have been successful if:

1. We have a clear idea of whether veterans who submit the healthcare application expect to receive a confirmation email, and find that confirmation clear, helpful, and useful.
2. We have a sense of what other kinds of notifications may be useful and helpful for vets.gov users.
3. We have a high-level sense of how veterans feel about text message notifications and where those might come into play for vets.gov.

## Who are our participants?

TBD

## Key research questions

1. Is a confirmation email for the healthcare application (and other benefit applications) expected, necessary, and useful?
2. Where else in the vets.gov ecosystem might notifications be helpful and useful?
3. How do people expect and prefer to receive notifications?

## Methods

- Remote usability testing of an InVision prototype of an updated healthcare application submission flow, followed by open-ended interview questions. 

## Conversation guide - Veterans and Current Servicemembers

## Intro

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Samara and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. We work with the team at the Department of Veterans Affairs on a website called Vets.gov, and we're excited to talk with you today to get your feedback on one particular part of the website. We'll take a look at a few pages together today, and then I'll ask you some questions related to what we looked at. 

In a couple minutes, we'll start looking at the site and I'll ask you some questions about what we're looking at. This will help us understand how to make it better.

Before we start, a few intro remarks:

- We aren’t trying to sell or promote any product or service to you.    
- We aren’t testing your ability. We're testing the site, we're not testing you, so there are no right or wrong answers. We want to hear your honest opinions becaue this is what helps us determine what works well, what doesn't, and how we can make the site better. I won’t be offended by any opinions you express.
- We'll be looking at a prototype. This means we are looking at something that looks like Vets.gov but is not the actual website. In the prototype, some things may not be clickable like they would be on the real website, which helps us focus on certain things for the purposes of testing. Do you have any questions about what a prototype is or what we'll be looking at today?
- This entire session should take about 30 - 45 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally interrupt you to move on to the next question or task.
- I’ll be recording the screen activities as we look at the site, so that we capture your experience accurately. It would also help me if you could narrate your thoughts out loud as we look at things so I have a better idea of what you're thinking.
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You can stop at any time, and you will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.

Any questions?

Now I'll read a statement to you about this session. I’ll ask you to either say that you agree to participate or that you do not agree to participate.

“Your participation in this session is voluntary. You may stop at any time. Things we learn today may be used in reports, shared online, and used in presentations. We will never use your real name in any report. We’re recording the session today to be sure that we capture your opinions and ideas accurately.”

Does that all make sense, and do you agree to participate?

Great! Any questions before we get started?

*Start audio and screen recording.*

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 2 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

*Background info about the participant should have been provided by Coordinator already, so use this time to ask any other questions that you feel will help with the session. This warm-up is not required*

- Can you tell me a little bit about yourself? (If stuck, prompt to ask about service experience, where they live, their work)
- Have you ever used Vets.gov before?

Now I'm going to share my screen with you. You should see the Vets.gov homepage, which says "Get the VA Services You've Earned."

## First Task: Evaluate HCA submission confirmation page - 5 minutes

Let's pretend today that you are applying for healthcare on Vets.gov. You can navigate to the healthcare application now [Note: navigating to the application is not a task we are evaluating, so it's OK to help them get there if they are having trouble.]

Now you're on a page that says "Apply for health care benefits" at the top. It looks like you already have an application started, so go ahead and continue that application.

[On "Fast Forward" page] Before we continue, let's pretend that you've already filled out most of this application in previous sittings and you're just here today to submit the application. This screen you are looking at not is part of Vets.gov and is only trying to communicate that today in testing we are just here to submit the application. Do you have any question before we continue? OK, you may click anywhere to go to the next screen.

You'll notice now that we are back in the Vets.gov application flow. You are on a page where you can review your application. You may review it as you see fit, and then please submit the application. 

Now we're looking at a page that says "Apply for Healthcare — Form 10-10EZ" at the top:

1. What is this page trying to communicate?
  * [ONLY If they notice that they are going to get an email] When would you expect to receive that email?
2. Is there anything you would do next, or are you finished with this process?

### Things to watch for:

- Does the participant notice that this page tells them to look out for an email?

## Second Task: Evaluate new HCA submission confirmation email - 10 minutes

If you can, please click anywhere on this screen. If I can draw your attention to the top of the page, you'll see you have a new email from Vets.gov. Please click that notification, and let's take a look at the email.

1. What is this email trying to communicate?
2. Why is the VA sending you this email?
3. What would you do if you had follow-up questions about your application?
4. Would you say this email is useful or not useful? Why or why not?
5. I'd like to draw your attention to the top of the page to the email address that sent this email — vetsdotgov@public.govdelivery.com. What do you think "public.govdelivery.com" is? 
  * Would you trust an email coming from this address?
6. After submitting an application like the healthcare application, would you expect to receive an email like this?
7. How long after you hit "submit" would you expect to receive this email?
  - If you didn't receive this email right away, what would you think if you received it a few hours after submitting your application? A day or two? A week?

### Things to watch for:

- Is the email useful?
- Did they expect to receive this email?
- Is this an email they want to receive, or does it feel like noise?

## Third Task: General questions about notification expecations and needs - 20 — 30 minutes

Thanks for sharing your thoughts on this email. Next, I'd like to close this screen and just ask you some questions.

- What benefits applications have you submitted to the VA?
- After you'd submitted that application, did you feel like you knew what to expect next? How did the VA keep you informed about progress and next steps? 
  - [If applicable] How could they have kept you informed better?
  - [If not already answered] Through what mean of communication would you have preferred the VA use to communicate with you in this process? This could be mail, phone, email, text messages, or anything else you can think of.
- In what other ways besides submitting applications have you interacted with the VA? 
- How could the VA have kept you better informed or communicated more efficiently with you in these interactions?
  - [If not already answered] Through what mean of communication would you have preferred to communicate with the VA in this process? This could be mail, phone, email, text messages, or anything else you can think of.
- In addition to everything we just talked about, is there any other correspondence that you can think of that would be helpful from the VA?
  - [If not already answered] Through what means of communication
- [If not already answered] Would you be opening to receiving emails from the VA? Why or why not? What kinds of emails?
- [If not already answered] Would you be opening to receiving text messages from the VA? Why or why not? What kinds of text messages?

Now I'd like to ask you some questions about emails and other correspondence you might receive currently from companies or organizations other than the VA.

- I'd like you to think of the emails you currently receive. Other than personal emails from people you know, what kinds of emails do you get?
  - [To clarify, if necessary] This could be any kind of email you might receive from a company or organization — something like a receipt from making a purchase, a newsletter, a notification about a sale at a store you shop at, or anything else you can think of.
- Of the emails you just mentioned [list a couple examples], which of these do you find useful? What kind of emails do you usually ignore, or wish you didn't get?
- What makes you pay attention to an email that you receive from a company or organization?
- Is there a company or organization that you've interacted with in the past that you think does a great job of user notifications? If yes... what company, what do they do, how frequently, what format, how much info, etc.... If no, can you think of a company or organization that you think does a terrible job of user notifications...
- What do you find annoying or unhelpful in these emails, or about receiving these emails?
- Do you ever receive things like receipts, reminders, or other notifications over text message in addition to, or instead of, email? 
  - [If no] Would you be open to receiving text messages like this? If so, what kinds of things would you like to receive over text message? 
  - Remember the email we had looked at earlier that said the VA had received your healthcare application? Would you be open to receiving that confirmation as a text message instead of, or in addition to, an email?

### Things to watch for:

- What kind of correspondence would be helpful that may be things we can address with email/text/profile or dashboard notifications on Vets.gov?
- Are people open to receiving correspondence via text?
- What kinds of notifications do people general find helpful and useful? Noisy and annoying?

## Post-Task Interview - 2 minutes

Those are all the questions I have for you today. Do you have any other questions or comments about anything you've looked at or anything we've discussed today?
