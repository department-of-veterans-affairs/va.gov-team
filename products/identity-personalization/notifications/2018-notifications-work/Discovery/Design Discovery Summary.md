<h2>Design Discovery Summary</h2>

In the last few weeks, we've done the following background research and discovery that will inform the notification project going forward:

* Reviewed previous conversations on notifications in GitHub.
* Reviewed different flows and found potential opportunities for notifications:
  * Documented in [interaction maps](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/tree/master/Products/Identity/Personalization/Notifications/Discovery/Interaction%20Maps).
  * The Pension application and user feedback form on vets.gov may also incorporate notifications. However, these features are currently not live on the site, so we will have to revisit when they're live again.
  * There are new applications in the pipeline (eg. VR&E application, Pre-burial needs), and we will explore the notifications needed for those features later.
  * We have not looked into sign up/login notifications.
  * Here is a [complete list of products that may require notifications](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Identity/Personalization/Notifications/Products%20that%20may%20require%20notifications.md).
* Looked into what we can/can not send to users over mediums like email and text.
  * This [privacy fact sheet](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Identity/Personalization/Notifications/Privacy%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf) was the best resource we found.
  * There are some additional documents in the [Vetext folder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/tree/ffe11b4583e296298bab6ee389275714344cdbf3/Products/Health%20care/Scheduling/Appointment%20Reminders/VEText).
* Researched [notification best practices](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Identity/Personalization/Notifications/Research/Notification%20best%20practices.md).


As a culmination, we completed the [Notification Discovery Brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Identity/Personalization/Notifications/Notifications%20Discovery%20Brief.md) and started outlining an initial testing plan.
