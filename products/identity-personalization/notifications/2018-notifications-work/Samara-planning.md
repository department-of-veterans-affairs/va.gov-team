# Notifications

This includes:

1. Internal notifications — Notifications that live on VA.gov
2. External notifications - Email, text
  - Potentially could include management of paper mail

# Internal notifications 

## Things we need to figure out

- The potential notifications do could we show on VA.gov
- Where notifications live
  - If there is a separate notification center, or whether notifications live on the new logged in homepage
  - Whether notifications also live on tool pages (either some or all of the time)
- How to mark a notification as read
- Whether there is any kind of archive of notifications (and if so long, how far back it goes)
- What the overall flow would look like when we have external notifications

## User questions we have

- Are internal notifications helpful, or do people only want external notifications?
- Where do users expect to see status update/time-sensitive notifications on VA.gov?

## Potential discovery activities

- Create an inventory of all existing status/time-sensitive updates we currently have on the site (My VA).
- Create an inventory of other potential notifications we could add over time.
- Some sort of user research.
- Competitive analysis of notification behaviors.

## Other

- Is there anything useful in [this doc](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Identity/Personalization/Notifications/Full%20list%20of%20potential%20and%20existing%20notifications.xlsx)?

## MVP

- How notifications will work on VA.gov
  - Status updates (no action required)
  - Time sensitive updates (action required)
- Only existing notifications we have access to (what's on My VA)

## Future work

- Incorporate additional notifications we don't currently have access to on VA.gov

# External notifications

## Things we need to figure out

- Figure out all existing and possible notifications we could show 
- What kinds of notifications we want to support (email? text? turning off paper?)
- How we would power email/text notifications
- Where notification preferences would be managed
- How we could set up a process so each team could manage their own email/text notifications
- How external notifications would work with internal notifications
- The overall flow for notifications (external --> internal --> tool, if applicable)

## User questions we have

- Where do people want to receive notifications?
- How do people expect to manage notifications?
- What are the most helpful notifications for people?

## Potential discovery activities

- Take inventory of all existing notifications we have on the website
- Work with each product line to figure out all additional possible notifications

## MVP

Create infrastrucutre for notifications

- Figure out how we'd power email notifications — this would likely be more about our internal VA team figuring out what we need to get in place so we can establish a sustainable notifications engine.
- Figure out if there is a vehicle for text notifications (VETTEXT?) or if we'd need one.
- Figure out process for teams to be able to manage their own notifications.

## Future work

With proper infrastructure at least for email notifications, we would:

Pick one team/product and:

- Establish an initial set of notifications 
- Create those notifications
- Create a place to manage those notifications

Beyond that:

- Figure out process so other teams can create and manage their own notifications in the future with oversight from the authenticated experience team.
