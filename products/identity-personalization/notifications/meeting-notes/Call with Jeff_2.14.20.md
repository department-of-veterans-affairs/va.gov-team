## Call with Jeff Barnes 2.14.20

Purpose of this call: Find out what infrastructure we have in place for notifications.

- Direct deposit has API key from Granicus. Normally, Granicus is a one-to-many system and not indlividual email system. However, Direct Deposit was able to get individual emails set up. 
- Jeff circled back to Josh Tuscher because Premal/Clarice/authenticated experience will need individual emails going forward. Mary/Jeff worked with Josh to modify contracts to account for this.
- In the new contract, we have ability to send up to 400K emails per year before we need to upgrade to the next option. For any work we do, we need to coordinate with Jeff and Mary so they can manage the contract aspects and upgrade if we need to.
- For new notification work:
  - Scope it and know how many emails will be sent.
  - Reach out to Josh with plan.
  - Josh will give the contractor green light to work with us.
- Josh is busy, so may need to ping him more than once.
