# Notifications overview
Tressa Furner 10/20/2021

This project is in it's beginning phases, but we've done quite a bit of discovery work around this. We've done one initial round of usability testing with a prototype to understand if we're going in the right direction. I have a plan to run a moderated card sort to help understand which notifications are a priority for users.
