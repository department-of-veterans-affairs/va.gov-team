# Onsite Notifications Use Cases
**Last updated:** November 3, 2022

For all use cases, the user must be LOA3 (identity verified). If the user is not LOA3, they will see a prompt to verify their identity and only be able to apply for benefits [(see LOA1 documentation)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/notifications/vagov-notifications/use-cases/onsite-notifications-loa1-user.md).

## Common Use Cases
