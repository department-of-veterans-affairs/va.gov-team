# How the debt feature works as of April 2022

Note: This may change and become outdated once copays are added to the debt feature. 

Originally from [issue #39274](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/36184#event-6523436306):

### Are there still 3 different kinds of debt?

Veterans can incur the following debt types:
- CH 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill)
- CH 34
- CH 35 (Dependents and Survivors*)
- Compensation & Pension

### Can you only have one debt for each type? Or could have you multiple debts for each kind of debt?

A Veteran can only have one debt for each type at a time. For example, a Veteran could have a $200 Compensation & Pension debt due to an overpayment. Let's say they receive another overpayment of $50. That $50 is added as a 'debt increase' to the $200 for a total of $250 rather than a separate $50 Compensation & Pension debt being created.

An exception to this is: if a Veteran incurs a Post-9/11 GI Bill Debt (CH 33), that debt is split into 3 separate debts. These debts are:

- Post-9/11 GI Bill debt for books & supplies
- Post-9/11 GI Bill debt for housing allowance
- Post-9/11 GI Bill debt for tuition and fees

### Is there any data about how many veterans have multiple different debts?

Riley doesn't have access to that kind of data, but our main stakeholder at the Debt Management Center, Jill, may be able to provide that information when your team connects with her!

However, it's going to be a relatively common use case anyway since Post-9/11 GI Bill debts are split into 3 separate debts.

Important takeaway from above is that multiple debts is not necessarily an edge case, but there will likely never be more than 3 presented on My VA since veterans will have a balance for each type of debt.
