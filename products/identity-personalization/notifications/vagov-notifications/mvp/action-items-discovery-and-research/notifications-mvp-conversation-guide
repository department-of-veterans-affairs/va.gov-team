# Research Plan for Authenticated Experience, Notifications MVP UAT, August 2022

## Background
Throughout [My VA 2.0 research and discovery](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md) in 2020 - 2021, a recurring theme mentioned by Veterans is that seeing personalized information upon login, including time-sensitive notifications at the top of the page, is important. Veterans said that they expected a mix of links and widgets to complete tasks on their homepage, and want clear labels to understand next steps.

This effort aims to add a notifications MVP to the My VA dashboard to elevate the most critical tasks for veterans who are lgoged in and LOA3, and give them clear steps to take action on these items.

See our [product brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/notifications/vagov-notifications) for more details.

### OCTO-DE Objectives 
The addition of a notifications section should help fulfill our north star objective of moving toward My VA being the one-stop shop for action items, so that it provides more direct, personalized routes to Veterans’ most critical updates and tasks.


## Research Goals	
The primary goal of our UAT is to confirm that our MVP functionality works as expected.

- We would like to validate that no major usability hurdles have been introduced during the iterations that have occurred, especially with the changes we made to the alert design.
- We would like to test notifications with a screen reader user to validate that the information is presented in line with their mental model and they are able to act on it as intended.
- We would like to validate that when a notification is triggered in VA Notify, a user sees a notification as intended at the top of My VA with the appropruare time stamp.
- We would like to verify that if a user receives multiple notifications, they are shown as individual notifications with time stamps ordered with the newest at the top.

### Outcome
Based on the outcome of this research study, we will either release our MVP to production, or update our design to correct any significant usability hurdles people encounter.

### Hypothesis
- Userswill notice the Notifications section upon login before proceeding on the page.
- Users will be able to easily take action on their notifications from My VA and dismiss them.
- Users will not encounter any bugs in the Notifications section.
- Screen reader users will feel that the information is presented in line with their mental model, and is easily understood and acted upon.
- The current warning alert component will cause some confusion about whether notifications are system errors or personalized action items.

## Method	
We'll have participants go through a list of specific tasks for UAT, and ask follow-up questions to get feedback on our usability related questions. We will test this feature in production and work with VA Notify to trigger notifications for participants.

### Location
Remote, via Zoom
