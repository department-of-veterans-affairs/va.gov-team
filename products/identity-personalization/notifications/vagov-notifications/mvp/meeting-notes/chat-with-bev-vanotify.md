# Initial chat with Bev re: VANotify |1.28.21

### VA Notify/VEText background

[VANotify product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-notify/README.md)

-	VANotify is based on updates that are triggered by the system, eg., there’s a change, let’s send an update.
-	VANotify can accommodate email AND text.
-	VEText sounds like it’s more for scheduled updates/notifications.
-	VEText and VANotify talk to each other, so there is some connection beween the systems.
-	VEText is accommodating non-health care notifications, at least right now for COVID.
-	VEText can also send emails via an integration with VANotify. Example: health appointment reminders: VEText handles that info, sends the text, and tells VANotify to send the email.

### Existing notifications

-	No formal list of notifications that are being sent, but at least the following exist so far:
  - Health appointment reminders
  - 526 notification
  - COVID emails
  
### Direct deposit emails

- We should move these over to VANotify. Create ticket/set up a chat about what this would involve.
