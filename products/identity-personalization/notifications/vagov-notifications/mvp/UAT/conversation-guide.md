## Intro - 2 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! I'm Angela, and today we're going to talk about the My VA dashboard on VA.gov. We'll specifically be looking at a notification feature that will inform veterans when they have a new debt.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **Are you okay with me letting a few observers in from the waiting room?** 
- **This entire session will be quick, it should take 15-20 minutes.** 
- **As always, we want to hear your honest opinions.** 
- **Please go slower than you normally would and if you could talk aloud about what you are doing, that would be great.** 
- **In this study we'll be looking at your REAL information - if at anytime you feel uncomfortable screensharing, please let me know and we can stop.** 

- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Screenshare

- I'll have you log in to VA.gov. We'll be starting today on the My VA page, so go ahead and click on My VA in the top right hand corner in the main navigation. Feel free to take a look at the page and then if you feel comfortable, share your screen with me.

## Questions

*If notification is showing as expected, proceed with questions. If not, end the session and inform VA Notify PM (Melanie) that it was not showing in the user's account to troubleshoot*
- Tell me what you see on this page and what's jumping out to you.
- What would you act on first?
- *(If they do not mention notifications)* Did you notice the Notifications section?
- Why do you think you might come to have this notification showing in your account?
- How important does it seem?
- How would you take action on it?
- If you paid this debt and then came back to My VA and the notification was still here, what would you do?
- *If they don't say they would dismiss the notification* How would you expect it to ever disappear?
- *(If the user has multiple notifications)* Why do you think you have more than one notification with similar content? *(Looking to see if the user assumes this is for multiple debts or multiple notifications for the same debt.)*
- *(For screen reader users only)* Is the notifications section placed where you would expect it to be on the page? Is the content read to you in the notification in a way that makes sense to you?

## Thank-You and Closing
