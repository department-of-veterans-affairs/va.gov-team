# Discovery Project Brief

## PROJECT BRIEF

### Project Name

Notification Settings (Text SMS Notification Settings)

### Problem Statement / How Might We statements
What problem are we trying to solve? Why are we doing this? (focus on problems, not possible solutions)

- Today, Veterans are being communicated primarily with **paper mail**. 
- We currently do **NOT** send any useful correspondence via email or text as it relates to official VA business.
- This antiquated method of communicating with Veterans is not meeting the needs of 21st century modern service delivery. 
- Paper communications not only incur print costs, but are also not timely or easily actionable to the Veteran. 

Opportunity
- How are we redesigning a timely, scalable, and effective modern digital notifications strategy? 
- How are we enabling greater control over _**when**_ and _**how**_ you hear from the VA?

### Project Details

* What do we know?
* What don't we know?
* Are any of the above assumptions that need to be verified?
* How are we going to find out answers? (There are tons of different methods to choose from depending on your project goals, resources, and time constraints. Checkout the methods and templates provided in the [Discovery Toolkit](DiscoverySprintHowTo.md) and consult the [Research Team](../Research).)
* What kinds of users are likely to benefit from solving this problem (bonus points for our personas)?
* Who do we need to talk to (stakeholders, Veterans, MHV Coordinators, etc.)? (Try to get a wide variety of people to get a range of perspectives – both higher ups and people on the ground doing the work. Meet with people in person whenever possible.)
* What secondary research should we do (google, facebook, internal documents)?
* Are there any intentional project constraints (things we're intentionally deeming out of scope)?
* Are there any challenges or risks that will make this discovery sprint hard to complete (tricky politics, technology complications, etc.)?
