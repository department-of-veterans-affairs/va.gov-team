## Description

This section of profile allows users to:

- Manage text and email notification preferences.  
- Review the contact info where notifications will be sent, when we have that information on file.

Notification types (appointment reminder, claim update, etc), channels (text/email), groups (e.g. health care, and settings will come through VA Profile's API.

## When/where to show the notification preferences section

**Show**

- We will always show this section.
- Should appear in profile nav immediately before connected apps (as shown in [desktop mock-ups](https://preview.uxpin.com/bb87d0fa61a32938a47e7bcdc836db235ab77576#/pages/137989650/comment/sitemap?mode=i))

## URL

URL for this section should [www.va.gov/profile/notifications](http://www.va.gov/profile/notifications) as noted in the [IA recommendations document](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/information-architecture/ia-reviews/auth-profile-notifications.md).

## Design 

Mobile and desktop example shows:

- Read mode
- 1 group (health care)
- Assortment of notifications that don't have a group defined in the API

### Prototypes

- Use prototype links above for latest versions of design.
- Check the documentation tab on the top right side of the prototype for screen-by-screen notes. Not all screens have documentation; orange dot indicates a screen has dev notes.

### Specs

- Follow existing patterns for padding + margins from other parts of profile
- Everything in this section pulls from existing patterns in profile or the VA design system.  There aren't any custom spacing patterns, components or icons. For example, use the site standard to set line height and spacing between `<li>` elements.

## Copy

`h1` and `nav` item reads: Notification settings

Copy below `h1`:

> We’ll use the contact information from your profile to send notifications: 
> ​**user email**
> ​**user mobile phone**
>
> [Update your contact information](/profile/personal-information)

Copy for notification types, channels, groups, and settings will come through VA Profile's API.

- Until we have groups in the API, section heading in gray box for notifications should read Notifications [as shown here](https://preview.uxpin.com/bb87d0fa61a32938a47e7bcdc836db235ab77576#/pages/138171974/comment/sitemap?mode=i).
- Once we have groups, any notifications that do not have a group assigned will go into an "Other notifications" section, as shown throughout mock-ups.

## States

### Edit mode

- Users should only be able to edit one group of notifications at a time.
- No fields are required.
- There are no possible input errors for this form.

### User deletes their associated contact information

Update copy in our confirmation alert so that when they delete their contact information, they'll see content letting them know they may not receive notifications anymore.  

[Mock-up, alert displays when someone clicks `Remove [contact info]` button from within mobile phone number](https://preview.uxpin.com/bb87d0fa61a32938a47e7bcdc836db235ab77576#/pages/138799478/simulate/sitemap?mode=i)

#### Copy

**Alert copy**

> This will delete your [mobile number or email address] across many VA records. You may no longer get some or all VA notifications by [text message or email]. You can always come back to your profile later if you want to add your [mobile number or email address] back in.

### User who is opted into notifications deletes their associated contact information

`draft, need to update once finalized`

If a user is opted into text messages or email notifications, and deletes their associated contact information, we will:

- treat them as if they're not getting notifications regardless of the data VA Profile is sending back. 
  - In the read view, this means they'll see that those notifications are turned off
  - In edit view, they won't have inputs to opt-in/out of notifications.

If a user is opted into text messages or email notifications, and deletes their associated contact information, **and then adds new information later**, we will:

- display all the notifications and options as if they had not ever deleted their information. We'll check with VA Profile in our next sync whether or not they will actually receive notifications at this new email/phone number automatically.
