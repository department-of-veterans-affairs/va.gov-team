# Notes from 12.11.20 chat with Terry and Mike

- Terry mentioned something about calling this work “communication permissions” instead of “notification preferences” because of organizational nuances around what these terms mean. 

## Release dates

- 12/14 — MVP
- 1/11 — Grouping release
  - Allows notifications to be grouped into a category; allows other pages to display groups of notification preferences based on a group ID for those preferences.
- 2/8 — Merge release 
- 4/30 — VANotify synchronization delivery

## Other notes

- Migration data staging/VETText data migration — the old build for this is going to go away at some point in favor of the new model.
- We need to start design planning in **February**.
