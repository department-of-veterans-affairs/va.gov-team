# VA Profile notification preferences: 11.30.20 chat with Mike Richard

- Phase 1: 12/14 — No deprecation of old functionality. 
  - This would be seeing what kind of permissions are available for a person (eg. The VA can contact me via email/text/etc).

- Grouping: 4 different groups in health that may send out notifications. Some could be text/direct message/email. Not 100% sure how the groupings will work, but it might be a health care group. Exact groupings are TBD. Mike is not familiar enough with the details.
  - Should go into prod 2/8.
  - Lihan could start development any time. Mike estimates this is 2 sprints worth of work.
  - Don’t start UI until we understand what the grouping is.
  - We need to wait for Terry to get back to understand more specifics around grouping.

- Migration from old bio information to newer framework — Leading up to deprecating old connections.
  - This does not have a date on it.
