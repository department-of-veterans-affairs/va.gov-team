# Notification Settings usability

## Pilot session, 6/11/2021

**M: Before we look at the prototype, I'd like to talk to you about notifications. Tell me about any email or text notifications you've received recently.**

Github messages from groups I'm in. Texts - yes lots of spam. 

**M: Did you choose to receive those notifications?**

Yes

**M: Can you tell me about a time you've needed to update settings for those notifications?**

Go into the repository, click on Notification. Or a drop down list, choose the issues I want to get a notification about. 

Spam texts: sell my rental property

**M: Where do you go to manage them?**

**M: What kinds of notifications do you currently get from VA?**

I have not received anything for a year. After trying to appeal my disability. 

**M: How do you receive them?**

Sent me an email. A new piece of info. It happened automatically. I'm part of the appeals process. Probably I accepted it when I started the process. 

**M; What kinds of VA notifications would be helpful to you that you aren't currently getting?**

Not sure, as my appeal failed.

**M; Where would you expect to find out about them?**

Like the way facebook is doing it - a bell by my profile name. Drop down of all notifications. These are things that I have elected to see. 

## Task 1: Navigate to notification settings - 2 minutes

**Imagine you heard the VA had recently started giving people the option to get text message updates on their medications. From here, show me where you would go to set that up for yourself.**

I would click on my profile name. I want it to be under settings. Profile - My Health

Would not expect to go into profile to change notifications there. I would rather go into My health and change notifications there. 

Feels weird having settings under Profile. Maybe Account security belongs with Notifications. Maybe it should be its own section?

*Change prototype - MY HEALTH link should not be active?* 

## Task 2: General impression - 5 minutes

*Participant should be on notification settings page of profile.*

**Thank you. Please don't click on anything just yet. Take a look at this page and talk me through what you see here. What can you do on this page?**

Notification settings - i can update contact info, see all the notifications i have about healthcare. Not sure if Benefits payments should be under My Health? Oh, this is Profile Notification Settings. I thought I clicked on My Health. 

**M: What notifications are you currently signed up for?**

I'm signed up for these notifications. (They Lists the different notifications). 

***Prod at notification groups if they haven't already mentioned it*: What types of things will you be notified about?**

**Based on what you see here, how are you getting notifications for scheduled payments?**

Benefit payment and debts. Texts only. 

**Where will VA send you notifications, based on what you see here?**

See a phone number at top.

**What would you do if that was an old phone number?**

I could update my contact info here. 

**What is your impression of the way the page is organized?**

Seems well organized. Good that each is in its own separate box with individual headers. And I can hit edit. 

## Task 3: Update and save settings for an existing channel - 5 minutes

**Thank you, all of that is really helpful for our team. Now, please go ahead and see if you can sign up for updates on your medications. Continue to talk out loud and share what you're thinking.**

Click on Edit. Uh, that is just a checkbox. It's what I expected. 

**If needed, when in edit mode: While you're here making this change, I'd like to pause and ask you a couple of questions.**

* **You got here by clicking edit - is that what you expected?**
* **How are you able to receive the notifications you see here? Why do you think that is?**

Just by text. Strange that they don't have my email address here. I should be able to choose email or text. If I update, maybe take me back to Personal info page. I would prefer it to show me a box that I could enter / edit info, and not take me to a new page. 

## Task 4: Update contact information and sign up for email notifications - 8 minutes

**Imagine that COVID updates are really important to you. Show me how you'd go about setting that up so you could get that notification.**

*Goes to Personal Info.* Confusing that I can't choose text. Why is this not an email or text option like all the rest? Confusing.

*They successfully add an email.* Goes to Notifications Settings. Why is this already on? I did not choose it. If it was not on - I hit update and select it. 

**M: Now that you've added an email address to your profile, talk me through what you see on this notifications page.**

I see my email at top, don't see any other changes. If I click on Edit under Benefits payment, maybe I can choose text or email. Because I added my email, i should be able to select email or text. 

## Task 6: Remove personal information - 2 minutes

**Now I'd like you to imagine you changed your mind, and don't want the VA to email notifications to you again. How would you remove the email address you added?**

Contact info - remove email address. I would double check General VA info and Updates. 

**Now that you've removed your email, what do you expect to happen with your notifications?**

I would not expect to get more notifications. This page makes sense. But strange that all of this is under Profile. Profile and settings and security all in one bucket. 

## Post-Task Interview - 4 minutes

**What notifications would you expect to see here that you didn't?**

Reminders to finish in progress applications - not sure if i will get notifications when the application has finished. Don't know if this would give me this info. 

There are two notifications here, one Edit button is missing. 

Your health care:  Strange that some have email and text and some only one of them.
