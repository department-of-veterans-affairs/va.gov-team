# Internal research study, August 2021

We conducted a small scale usability study in August of 2021 to validate some changes we did post-usability that we knew we weren't going to have time to do a more in depth study on prior to launch.

We recruited candidates internally (through DSVA and contracting team Slack instances) and asked them to review a prototype.
