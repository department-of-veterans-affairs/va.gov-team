# Research Plan for Authenticated Experience, Notification Settings, June 2021

## Goals	

### What product & team are you doing this research for?	

Profile notification settings, Authenticated Experience

### Background 	

The VA is ramping up their digital communications efforts, specifically through email and text. As a result, Veterans need to be able to opt in or out of communications and customize through which channels they prefer to be contacted. To meet these organizational and user needs, the VA Profile team is building a communications permissions engine that will integrate with the VA.gov profile frontend and allow veteran-managed settings to be saved and shared across systems at the VA.

See our [MVP definition](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/notifications/notification-preferences/product/communications-permissions-mvp-definition.md) for more details.

### Questions we hope to be able to answer through this research

1. What expectations do Veterans have about managing notifications?
2. What kind of notifications do Veterans expect to be able to receive from the VA?
3. What words do Veterans use to talk about or search for notification content?
4. How do Veterans expect to be able to discover notifications they're not currently opted in to?
5. Does our solution enable Veterans to manage their notifications without encountering UX hurdles?
6. Are we providing sufficient contextual information through group and notification names?
7. Do Veterans expect to be able to update their contact info right here on the page?
8. If a Veteran has partial contact info (missing a phone or email from their profile), do they understand how to make updates so they can get notifications to that channel?
9. Does a Veteran with partial contact info they understand email/text is also available when they don't have a checkbox to click?
10. Do they know how to get back to notification settings once they add info?
11. What kind of static content support makes sense for this section of profile?

We're also working on improvements to our user experience for removing contact information, so we'll include one question about that to evaluate during the final task in our sessions:

Do Veterans experience any usability hurdles when removing contact information from their profile?

### Our hypothesis for this research study

- Veterans will expect to be able to manage notifications from their profile.
- Veterans expect to be able to discover notifications they're not opted into via channels outside their profile - VAMC/call center interactions, campaigns, etc.
- Our solution will allow Veterans to intuitively manage their notification settings.
- The group and notification names will be easily understood.
- Our content and design will help Veterans understand why they can only manage notifications for the contact information they have on file.
- Having to go to the contact info section to update email or phone number will not be ideal, but it will be acceptable.
- Veterans will know how to get back to notification settings after updating their contact information.
- Veterans will be able to intuitively remove contact information without experiencing major usability hurdles.

## Method	

### What method of research are you planning? 	

This will be a 30-45 minute remote moderated usability test with a high-fidelity prototype.	

### Why this method?

A remote study will allow us to test with participants around the country. Testing with a high-fidelity prototype will provide insights to our research questions before investing time in engineering.  We'll start people a screen with partial contact information to help us evaluate our overall design, and help us understand:

- If our solution for partial contact info works for Veterans 
- If Veterans expect to be able to edit/update contact information right on the page
- If Veterans can get back to notification settings after they've updated their contact information

### Where are you planning to do your research? 

Zoom

### What will you be testing?

We'll test with a [UXPin prototype](https://preview.uxpin.com/5ecec4de6ec34eddc9f095677a881be3646124ce#/pages/139049739/simulate/sitemap?mode=i).

### Recruitment requirements

- All must have a laptop/desktop device and be willing to be complete their interview on said device
- The participants have Zoom downloaded prior to the session
- The participants know how to screen share
- Note that our prototype isn't compatible with assistive technology

### What is your recruitment strategy? 	

We will leverage Perigean's services to recruit participants.
