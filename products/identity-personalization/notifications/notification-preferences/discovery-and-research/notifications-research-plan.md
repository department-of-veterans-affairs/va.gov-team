### Notifications research questions

`*draft*`

- what kind of static content support makes sense for this section of profile?
- Do we need more explicit checkbox labels?
- Do people understand that `checked` = notifications on and `unchecked` = notifications off?
- Is the preview text (On: emails, text) meaningful and helpful?
- Do people understand the groupings? 
- If someone has partial contact info on file:
  - do they understand email/text is also available when they don't have a checkbox to click?
  - do they know how to add that information?
  - do they know how to get back to notification settings once they add info?
- What words do people use to talk about or search for notification content?
