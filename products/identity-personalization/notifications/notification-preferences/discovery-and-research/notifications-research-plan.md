### Notifications research questions

`*draft*`

- what kind of static content support makes sense for this section of profile?
- Do we need more explicit checkbox labels?
- Do people understand that `checked` = notifications on and `unchecked` = notifications off?
- Is the preview text (On: emails, text) meaningful and helpful?
- Do people understand the groupings?
