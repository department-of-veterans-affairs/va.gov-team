## Overview

While most of the MyHealtheVet migration into VA.gov will take place in the health care "apartment", universal information, like the MyHealtheVet profile and settings, will move into the VA.gov profile. After completing [an audit of the MyHealtheVet profile and personal information sections](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/mhv-profile-research/recommendations.md), we learned that most of the information that exists in the MHV profile already exists in the VA.gov profile. However, MHV notification preferences are not yet supported by VA.gov, and are an essential piece of functionality that needs to move in to VA.gov. This engagement covers definition, collaboration with MHV, VA Profile, and VA Notify, and the build in VA.gov that will support the MHV notification preferences.

## Problem Statement

- As a VA health care recipient, I want to choose how the VA communicates with me about difference aspects of my health care.

## User outcomes

### Desired User Outcomes

- Users can easily find and update their health care notification settings within the VA.gov profile, both before the health apartment is complete, and after.

### Undesired User Outcomes

- Users are confused about where to manage their health care settings while the MHV and VA.gov profiles coexist.
- Users have a difficult time signing in to VA.gov to change their notification settings before MHV is retired.

## Business outcomes

### Desired Business Outcomes

- VA.gov supports the existing MHV notification preferences, and some new ones, as part of this engagement.
- There is a clear path to guide users to the VA.gov profile once this functionality is supported on VA.gov.

### Undesired Business Outcomes

- (For VA.gov) We are put in a position to support a bunch of new settings that aren't actually ready to be supported.
- Users are confused about where to manage their health care settings while the MHV and VA.gov profiles coexist.

## Measuring success

OKRs and KPIs TBD.

## Solution approach

- We are initially engaging with the MHV team biweekly in order to define the notification preferences work before we go to VA Profile and VA Notify and fill out intake forms.

### Requirements

TBD

### Key dates

- February 2022: Begin MHV profile audit
- April 2022: Complete MHV profile audit findings report
- June 2022: Share audit findings with MHV team
- August 2022: Began MHV <> VA.gov biweekly meetings to scope out definition for notification preference migration in preparation for a VA Profile intake form
