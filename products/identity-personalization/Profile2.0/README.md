## Profile 2.0 Overview

The current Profile structure isn’t built to support the amount of new information Veterans expect or the features VA.gov needs to add. Its navigation and grouping don’t reflect how Veterans naturally think about their information, which leads to confusion, poor findability, and difficulty integrating new sections like dependents, financial information, or documents. The Profile cannot grow sustainably without a more intentional, extensible IA.

Veterans see the va.gov Profile as the place to understand what VA knows about them, what records they have, and where to update information. When the layout doesn’t match their expectations, they miss content, assume things are broken, or seek help elsewhere. As VA adds more data sources and capabilities, the Profile needs a structure that makes information easy to find, reduces misnavigation, and supports a seamless “one-stop” experience.

## Solution

Profile 2.0 introduces a reorganized, research-backed information architecture that aligns with Veteran mental models and creates space for new features. It restructures sections, updates naming, and groups related information more intuitively so the Profile can incorporate dependents, letters and documents, expanded financial information, health care settings, communication preferences, and future additions without creating confusion.

## Impact

Veterans will be able to find information more easily, understand where things belong, and complete tasks with less trial and error. The Profile becomes a clearer and more trustworthy source of their personal information. For VA.gov, the new IA provides a scalable foundation that reduces support issues, improves usability, and allows new Profile features to be added cleanly over time.
