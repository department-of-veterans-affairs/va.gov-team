## Overview
The VA.gov authenticated experience thus far has been primarily focused on the user journey for existing Veterans or other VA beneficiaries - i.e. Veterans or beneficiaries who are already active in and relatively familiar with VA.gov by way of claim submission, applying for health care and engaging with other VA-sponsored benefits. We will be performing research and discovery to gather a baseline understanding of the transition process from active duty military to Veteran status, the impact VA.gov can have on the transition process, how a distinct onboarding experience could improve the transition process, and what that might look like on VA.gov. 

This is in alignment with OCTO objective 1 for 2024: Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.


## Problems
We do not have a defined onboarding experience on VA.gov. We hypothesize that a lack of digital onboarding guidance for newly transitioning Veterans presents challenges in efficiently and effectively getting Veterans the relevant services and resources they need, leading to potential frustrations, delays, and missed opportunities for support and access to eligible benefits. 

## Solution approach
Before embarking on a large development effort to build an onboarding solution, we need to validate our hypothesis and learn more about the transition process as well as define what a good onboarding experience looks like.

We need to answer the following questions:
- What role does VA.gov play in how people onboard to VA as a whole?
- How can we update VA.gov to make it easier to onboard at VA?
- What does successful onboarding to the authenticated experience on VA.gov look like?
    - Benefit eligibility 
    - Benefit access
    - Profile completion
    -  _What else?_
- Does the scope of our approach solely focus on transitioning Veterans or any "new" to VA.gov users (e.g. transitioning MHV users, Veterans who have never used VA.gov) as well? 

There are other groups and stakeholders who will likely have an interest in our findings, including but not limited to the groups listed below. We will need to consult with these groups to knowledge share about onboarding processes so that we are not duplicating efforts.
- VES
- VA mobile team
- VHA and health modernization teams (MHV on VA.gov)



## Business Outcomes
### Desired Outcomes
- Basic understanding of challenges associated with the transition process, specifically with regard to how VA.gov could remedy those pain points

### Undesired Outcomes
- Scope creep: we cannot solve all challenges between DoD and VA regarding the process of transitioning from active duty to Veteran status
