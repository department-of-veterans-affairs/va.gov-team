# Transitioning Service Members: Research Review

February 26, 2024

Liz Lantz, Authenticated Experience

## Background
We are conducting research to gather a baseline understanding of the transition process from active duty military to Veteran status, the impact VA.gov can have on the transition process, and how a distinct VA.gov onboarding experience might improve that process.

This is in alignment with two key OCTO objectives for 2024:
* Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.
* Our platforms are the best way to deliver products.

## Research goals
We reviewed previous research to achieve the following goals:
1. Get a better understanding of the transition experience for separating service members, and the role VA.gov could play in transition.
2. Understand what we already know that could inform an onboarding solution.
3. Learn what other VA teams have done with regard to onboarding, if anything.

## Findings
1. Transitioning from the service to becoming a Veteran is a process that largely takes place in the real world, not online. ([Link](#transitioning-from-the-service-to-becoming-a-veteran-is-a-process-that-largely-takes-place-in-the-real-world-not-online))
2. There are a variety of reasons Veterans don’t engage with the VA when they separate from the military. ([Link](#there-are-a-variety-of-reasons-veterans-dont-engage-with-the-va-when-they-separate-from-the-military))
3. Service members would find it helpful to receive structured and specific resources about VA and benefit eligibility, especially about benefits other than health care or disability ratings. ([Link](#service-members-would-find-it-helpful-to-receive-structured-and-specific-resources-about-va-and-benefit-eligibility-especially-about-benefits-other-than-health-care-or-disability-ratings))
4. Previous research doesn’t explicitly point to the need for a digital onboarding UX. ([Link](#previous-research-doesnt-explicitly-point-to-the-need-for-a-digital-onboarding-ux))
5. We identified things that would foster a sense of trust and make an onboarding experience useful, if we want to pursue it. ([Link](#we-identified-things-that-would-foster-a-sense-of-trust-and-make-an-onboarding-experience-useful-if-we-want-to-pursue-it))

## Findings Details
### Transitioning from the service to becoming a Veteran is a process that largely takes place in the real world, not online.
It is a major adjustment for service members to acclimate to civilian life; a significant factor in this is the **lack of structure and direction, and the departure from their military community and support system**. 

The [journey map](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/onboarding/discovery-research/2022-Transition_JourneyMap_v10.pdf) highlights some other factors that can be particularly challenging:
- Some service members have never lived independently prior to joining the military.
  > Transition even now is just basic adult functions that you never develop or have to worry about, the basic things like budgeting, planning grocery shopping for the week that normal adults develop as they grow from teens to young adults to adults moving into their first apartment and jobs where it is developed slowly over time. We are just thrown out expecting to know it -  P2, Service Member Interviews, Personalization 2.0 research ([notes](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/personalization%202.0/discovery-research/service-member-interviews/p2_8.14.19_0900.md))
- Some service members do not want to separate from the military (e.g. forced medical retirement).
- Varied levels of separation support and guidance from their command and TAP training
  > Like I said, I went to 4 different seminars over 5 years and not a single one was the same. The basics, yes, but the focus was different. It is the quality of the briefers and what they are willing to talk about but limited to what they can provide. - P1, Service Member Interviews, Personalization 2.0 research ([notes](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/personalization%202.0/discovery-research/service-member-interviews/p1_8.7.2019_0900.md))

While a website or digital tool can serve as a resource, it would not completely solve the problem of transition.
> I don’t need three days of a slide show that gives me websites I can go to. Give me relevant information. - P2, Service Member Interviews, Personalization 2.0 research ([notes](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/personalization%202.0/discovery-research/service-member-interviews/p1_8.7.2019_0900.md))

### There are a variety of reasons Veterans don’t engage with the VA when they separate from the military.
- Echoes of Department of Defense make some Veterans uncomfortable in engaging with VA, especially if they had a bad experience in the military.
  > For some, this is due to a negative or traumatic military experience. For others, the military experience was simply a taxing one and they do not want to prolong it by interacting with VA.  - Insight 1.1, Under 40 Trust Scores, Veteran Interviews, 2023 ([pdf](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/blob/master/research-proposals/VEO/2023-03%20Under%2040%20Trust%20Scores%20Veteran%20Interviews/U40%20Insights%20Report%20Final.pdf))
- There can be a lack of clarity around benefits eligibility.
- The complexity of VA discourages people from applying for benefits, especially for people with cognitive considerations.
  - VA services and resources are not as structured as they were in the military, which causes confusion, frustration, and ultimately, disengagement.
  - Some Veterans have a perception that using VA benefits takes them away from other Veterans who may be in greater need.
- They’re focused on the next steps for the education or career, and aren’t sure how VA fits into that.
  - For many Veterans, Transition Assistance Program (TAP) training focuses on VA health care, so they don’t hear much about other VA benefits there.

### Service members would find it helpful to receive structured and specific resources about VA and benefit eligibility, especially about benefits other than health care or disability ratings. 
- Multiple documents we reviewed talked about service members being used to receiving clear, specific and actionable information in the military, and feeling confused and discouraged by the clack of that structure in the civilian world.
  > I need my resources to provide me with **specific information** and enough time to put actionable steps into my plan.  - [Transition Personas, 2022](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/onboarding/discovery-research/2022-Transition_Personas_v6.pdf)

  > Strategic and clear messaging that states what VA does for young Veterans [is a trust maker/value creator] - Under 40 Trust Scores, Veteran Interviews, 2023 ([pdf](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/blob/master/research-proposals/VEO/2023-03%20Under%2040%20Trust%20Scores%20Veteran%20Interviews/Under40TrustExecutiveSlides_6.1.23.pdf))

- We heard that TAP training is general, and mostly focused on health care and disability benefits from VA.
  > It was something like a bit about healthcare and then you know how in elementary school you had to do a book report and you didn't have time to read all of it? That’s how it was when they did the brief, it was like that hour was up and it was back to everything else. It was a slide with contact information that you could go to this website. - P2, Service Member Interviews, Personalization 2.0 research ([notes](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/personalization%202.0/discovery-research/service-member-interviews/p2_8.14.19_0900.md))

  > M: What did you learn about receiving benefits at VA [during TAP training]?
  > P4: Just a brief overview, they don’t go into a lot of detail on how it works or go talk to a VSO or other organizations. I have looked online but not a lot due to being busy.

### Previous research doesn’t explicitly point to the need for a digital onboarding UX.
- There wasn’t anything in the studies we reviewed that obviously points to the need to create a digital onboarding UX.
- The [journey map](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/onboarding/discovery-research/2022-Transition_JourneyMap_v10.pdf) specifically called out that checklists are not a helpful onboarding tool
  >   Out-processing, transitioning or supplemental checklists are redundant or confusing

  > *“The best way to describe the checklist [the military provides when you’re out processing] is a scavenger hunt. You have to turn in a bunch of paperwork but it doesn’t give a lot of information.”*

### We identified things that would foster a sense of trust and make an onboarding experience useful, if we want to pursue it.

#### Unauthenticated experience
- Making it clear that using VA benefits does not detract or take away benefits from any other Veteran.
  - Multiple studies reference hesitation or shame about using VA benefits because people feel they are undeserving or taking away from others. ([Digital health modernization, insight 2](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/pre-mhv-prototype/generative-research-study-1/research-findings.md#insight-2-the-va-ecosystem-is-so-complex-that-veterans-feel-discouraged-to-apply-for-manage-and-maximize-their-benefits), and [Under 40 Trust Score findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/blob/master/research-proposals/VEO/2023-03%20Under%2040%20Trust%20Scores%20Veteran%20Interviews/Under40TrustExecutiveSlides_6.1.23.pdf))
- Providing transparent and authoritative information that simplifies complexities.
  - People currently heavily rely on “word of mouth” to make sense of VA, and get mixed information.
  - We know the complexity of VA discourages people to maximize their benefits. ([Digital Health Modernization research, insight 2](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/pre-mhv-prototype/generative-research-study-1/research-findings.md#insight-2-the-va-ecosystem-is-so-complex-that-veterans-feel-discouraged-to-apply-for-manage-and-maximize-their-benefits))
- Introducing concepts that are unique and specific to VA. There are many opportunities here, but some examples could be:
  - who qualifies as a dependent 
  - what is an overpayment
  - what role can a VSO play in helping a person get benefits
- Helping people connect to support systems
  - It feels like VA.gov may not be the right venue for this, but it’s something newly separated Veterans need. 
  - It’s worth thinking about how we might help foster those connections.
- Helping people understand the sign in process. 
  - Confusion about this process came up in the research we reviewed, and is a frequent topic in research studies. ([Feedback on the sign-in process from participants across many studies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/Research/Identity%20topics%20from%20unrelated%20studies.md))
  - People need to sign in to complete many core benefit tasks; helping reduce friction with this step will likely help people onboard.

#### Authenticated experience
All of the above could carry over into the authenicated experience. In addition, once a person was in MPI, we could:
- Personalize the content above based on what we know about a person (service history, location, etc)
- Surface benefit recommendations alongside existing benefit management in a single place.
  - We’ve heard participants positively use the phrase “one-stop shop” when talking about My VA or the health landing page.
  - This also came up in the dependents research last year:
    > Veterans are looking for a “one-stop-shop” on VA.gov that would allow them to review, manage, and stay informed on eligibility opportunities….Veterans also wanted more integration across programs to help eliminate redundant information, and so that they could learn about, track, and manage their benefits in a way that aligned with their dependents' life phases, i.e. a life-stages “roadmap.” - Dependents research ([finding 4](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/dependents/research/2023-09-dependents-research/research-findings.md#key-findings))

### Other VA.gov teams, and the mobile team, haven’t done a lot with an onboarding UX yet.
We reached out to various teams in Slack to see if anyone has explored onboarding.
- The mobile team has 4 screens that serve as a light “onboarding” flow. The screens function as a list of things the app does (as opposed to onboarding/teaching about features contextually or helping them get the app set up the best way for them). Their research ([pdf, page 10 ](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-research/post-launch-discovery/July%202023/Mobile%20App%20Retention/Flagship%20Mobile%20App%20Retention%20-%20Insights%20from%20App%20Analytics%20(August%2015%2C%202023)%207.37.42%20AM.pdf)) suggests:
  - there is no evidence that viewing all of the onboarding screens straight through improves frequency retention compared to skipping Onboarding from the first screen.
  - the design of the onboarding carousel flow complicates the ability to evaluate how the onboarding flow impacts retention.
- The Digital Health Modernization team has not explored any onboarding approach or solutions at this point.
- The check-in team briefly thought about a first time user experience (FTUE), but did not flesh out the idea.

## Additional insights
- In research sessions, we frequently hear that people don’t know what My VA is, and they react very positively once they see it. This is important to keep in mind because it *could* be a good place to onboard people if we can actually get them there.
- In a non-clinical services taxonomy study, participants created categories related to transitioning from the military. This helps us understand how they might label this process. They created the following categories:
  - Onboarding
  - Incoming Veterans
  - Transition
  - Post-service (aka I'm out - what now?)
## Outstanding questions
1. We’ve confirmed it makes sense for us to continue with our work in parallel with what VES is working on; where will their MVP live, or what exactly are they going to do with that?
2. What do we know about Skillbridge or dedicated transition units? It would be interesting to hear how those are helpful to folks to inform our own boarding work.
3. Does the chatbot have any content about transition?
4. How does the chatbot work and where people currently use it on the site?
5. Why is now the time to pursue a VA.gov onboarding solution?
6. Which parts of the onboarding solution would be unauth, and which would be auth? 
7. Have we ever considered incorporating an onboarding strategy into the “service member benefits” benefit hub?
