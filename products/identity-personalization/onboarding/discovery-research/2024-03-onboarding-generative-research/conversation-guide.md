## Intro - 3 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Liz and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them... 

Today we're going to talk about your experience learning about VA as part of the process of separating from service.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:
- First, I want to confirm your separation status. According to my notes you’re a [service member/Veteran] and [are separating by Dec 31 of this year / separated on or after June 1, 2023]. Is that correct?
  - *If not correct, end the session*
- According to my notes, you said you’d be willing to create an identity verified account for VA.gov.  Is that correct?
  - First, do you know if you already have a VA.gov account?
  - This process will require you to submit some personal information online to verify you are who you say you are, including your social security number.  You’ll also have to upload a picture of a government issued ID.
  - 
- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
  - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
  - If yes: Admit observers.
  - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)
  - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
  - Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
- **Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences?**  We blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image. 

  *Start recording.*

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?**

## Confirm level of experience with VA - 1 minute

Great! As a first step, I’d like to briefly confirm the info I got in advance of the session.  It says here that you have [experience with VA]. Is that correct?

And, I also understand that you have [experience with VA.gov]. Is that correct too?

Great. We’ll go into detail about both of those things later in our conversation.  

## Understand familiarity with VA benefits and services  - 10 minutes

First, I’d like to hear about what you know about VA services and benefits.
- How did you learn these things?
- What was your experience like, learning about VA?
- How did you expect to learn about VA service and benefits?
- How did what you experienced line up with those expectations?
- What would you change about what you’ve learned about these things so far?
- As a researcher, I don’t have the knowledge to tell you all about VA benefits and services, but I’m curious to know what questions do you still have about them?

*Optional questions, as needed:*
- What questions came up as you tried to learn about what the VA could do for you?
- Was any of it difficult or confusing? 
- How did you clarify any confusion?
- Were there any digital tools you used to help you get familiar with VA? 
- Have you ever engaged with a VSO or representative? If so, what support did they provide?

## Understand engagement with VA  - 10 minutes

* How have you engaged with VA so far?
  * *If needed: clarify online, in person, through VSO, etc*
* What has that been like?
* What VA benefits have you used and why?
* What would encourage you to learn more about VA benefits (that you may not be using)?
* What benefits are you most interested in accessing?
* Are there any resources you wish you had, but don’t?

*Optional questions, as needed:*
* What digital or online tools have you used to engage with VA?
* What has prevented you from engaging with VA?
* What’s been challenging so far about your engagement with VA?
* How have you navigated that?
* Have you ever engaged with a VSO or representative? If so, what support did they provide?


## Understand experience with VA.gov - 10 minutes

- Earlier you mentioned you have [level of experience with VA.gov]. How did you first hear about the website?
- What expectations, if any, did you have about the website?
- What did you first try to do on the website? What was that like? 
- What else have you done on the website?
- What has your overall experience been like?
- What would you tell other [service members/veterans] about the website?
- How did your experience of the website line up with what you expected?

Let’s go to the website and take a look together. I’d love for you to retrace your steps and show me what you’ve done on the site so far.  It’ll be really helpful if you can think out loud as much as possible as you review the website.

*Begin screensharing.*

*Optional questions, as needed:*
* Were you able to find what you needed on the site?
* Did you sign into the website? 
* What did you expect the website to be like once you signed in?
* What was signing into the site like?
* How did the website line up with your expectations, after you signed in?
* Do you have the VA Health and Benefits mobile app?
  * *If yes:*
  * How did you hear about the app?
  * When did you first start using it?
  * What are the main reasons you use it?
  * How frequently do you go into the app? Daily? Weekly? Monthly?
  * What do you like best? What do you wish you could change?
* What other VA digital tools do you use? What are the reasons you use these tools instead of the health and benefits app, or VA.gov?

## Optional - create va.gov account and review auth exp - 15 minutes

Now we’re to the point where we can create that account, if you’re still up for it. Would that be ok with you? It’s ok if you’d rather not.

If yes, proceed. If not, go to post task interview.
### When ready to create account:

I will pause recording when you get to the screen where you need to enter personal information, and we can also stop screen sharing at any point. Just let me know.

One thing we are particularly interested in seeing is the final step of the account creation process - the last screen before you finish and go back to VA.gov. I’d like for you to start screensharing before you click that last button, and start the recording back up again. 

Does that work for you?

- ***Pause recording***
- **Handle screensharing accordingly**. 
  - May need to start if we haven’t yet, or 
  - pause if we have started and  participant does not want to screenshare.

It’ll be really helpful if you can think aloud as you go through this process, so we can understand how this works for you.  I especially want to hear about things that are unclear, confusing, or frustrating.

**Once participant gets to last step, resume screensharing and recording**

**Pay attention to**
- What does the last step look like where the user confirms their account?
- Is the person routed back to VA.gov?
- What is displaying on VA.gov?
- Are there any more “verify your account” alerts displaying on VA.gov?

***Have you restarted screensharing and recording?!***
- Awesome, now let’s go check out VA.gov. I’m curious to get your first impressions of the site once you’re signed in.
- Let’s check out My VA. Tell me your impressions of this page.
- I’d like to show you the user profile, but before we go there, talk to me about what you expect to see in a user profile?
- Now, let’s go to your profile. What do you think about this section of the site?
- If you wanted to [do something they talked about earlier in the session] can you show me how you’d find that now that you’re signed in?
- How does this line up with what you’d expect from a website once you’re signed in?

## Post-Task Interview - 10 minutes

- What would it take for you use more VA benefits and services than you are today?
- If you could wave a magic wand and change something about your experience in learning about and starting to use VA services, what would you change?
- Any questions for me? 

## Consent to use video clips

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that **you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?** Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
  - If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?

## Thank-You and Closing - 1 minute

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
