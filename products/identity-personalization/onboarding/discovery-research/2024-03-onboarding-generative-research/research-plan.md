# Research Plan for Authenticated Experience, TSM Engage with VA Generative Research, March 2024
## Background
The VA.gov authenticated experience thus far has been primarily focused on the user journey for existing Veterans or other VA beneficiaries - i.e. Veterans or beneficiaries who are already active in and relatively familiar with VA.gov by way of claim submission, applying for health care and engaging with other VA-sponsored benefits. 

We want to conduct generative research with to build a baseline understanding of the transition process from active duty military to Veteran status, so that we can evaluate the impact VA.gov may have on the process of onboarding to VA overall.  We’ll focus this research on transitioning service members (TSM) who are soon-to-be-separated, or recently separated from service.

**Note:** This research uses the term “onboarding” to describe the broad process service members go through to learn about and begin to engage VA. Although these topics may come up, we aren’t focusing on: 
- the formal separation process or training service members go through (TAP) or
- the overall experience and problems related to transitioning from military to civilian life

[Project outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/onboarding/README.md).

### OCTO Priorities 

This research supports the 2024 goal “Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.”

### Veteran Journey
This research is most closely related to moments that matter within three early phases of the Veteran journey ([journey map](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)). 
- **Serving:** Managing military and family obligations
- **Getting out:** Understanding the process of separating
- **Starting up:** Attending to health needs and finding a place to live 

## Research Goals	
Our primary goal with this research is to identify any problems people experience when separating from the military that could be improved or resolved through VA.gov. 
 
### Outcome
This research will help us determine if we need to make changes to existing VA.gov features, or build new ones, to help people onboard to VA.

### Research questions
1. What role does VA.gov have in onboarding people to VA?
2. What changes, if any, could we make to improve the experience of onboarding to VA through VA.gov?
3. What challenges do people have using VA.gov when they're using it for the first time?
4. Where does VA.gov fit within the mental model of people who are onboarding to VA?
5. What are the top questions transitioning service members have about VA?

### Hypothesis
Based on what we learned in our [previous research review](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/onboarding/discovery-research/research-review.md), we hypothesize that we’ll learn: 
- VA.gov will be able to improve the process of onboarding to VA through content and IA updates targeted to service members, especially on the following topics:
  - eligibility
  - applying for benefits
  - benefits of creating a VA.gov account.
- People will want a personalized experience when onboarding to VA that reflects their specific situation, but not necessarily expect that to be possible through a government agency like VA.
- There isn’t a single online tool or experience that will resolve problems people have when they separate from service and transition to VA.

## Methodology	
We’re planning to conduct remote, semi-structured interviews over Zoom.

### Research materials
- [Conversation guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/onboarding/discovery-research/2024-03-onboarding-generative-research/conversation-guide.md)
- VA.gov

## Recruitment	
### Recruitment approach
We want to use Perigean to recruit **13 participants for a total of 1 completed pilot session and 8 completed formal sessions.**

### Recruitment criteria
All participants must be willing to join a Zoom session through their phone (dial-in only is acceptable) or a computer.

#### Separation status
1. At least 6 participants must be active duty service members who will be separating from service by December 31, 2024.
2. At least 6 participants must be Veterans who separated from service on or after June 1, 2023.

#### Military branch
Participants should represent a mix of branches:
- At least 2 Army 
- At least 2 Navy
- At least 2 Marine
- At least 2 Air Force or Space Force
- At least 1 Coast Guard

#### Experience with VA
Participants should represent a mix of experience with VA, and with VA.gov. 
- At least 3 should have no direct experience with VA or VA.gov
- At least 3 should have some experience with VA, but no experience with VA.gov
- At least 3 should have some experience with VA.gov

#### Demographics and inclusion
- Participants should represent a mix of genders and ethnicities.
  - At least 5, but no more than 8, who identify as other than male
  - At least 5, but no more than 8, who identify as other than Caucasian
- At least 5, but no more than 8, should not have a degree higher than an associates degree or technical certification
- At least 5 participants should identify as having a cognitive impairment.

### Screener questions
1. Are you able to join the research session by dialing in through a phone call, or from a smart phone or computer? (Answer should be yes for all participants to qualify)

> Response options: yes or no

2. Are you an active duty service member who will be separating from service by December 31, 2024?
> Response options: yes or no (answer should be yes to qualify for separation status, criteria 1)

2. Did you separate from from service on or after June 1, 2023?
> Response options: yes or no (answer should be yes to qualify for separation status, criteria 2)

3. How would you describe your level of engagement with VA so far? **Note:** We ask this question because we want to make sure to talk to people who have a variety of experience with VA.
> Response options: radio buttons (answers
> - I have not engaged with VA at all.
> - I have some familiarity with VA benefits and services, but have never applied for any.
> - I have applied for VA benefits and services, but I don’t receive any yet.
> - I receive or have received VA benefits and services.

4. How often do you use with VA.gov? **Note:** We ask this question because we want to make sure to talk to people who have a variety of experience with VA.gov.
> Response options: radio buttons
> - I’ve never used VA.gov.
> - I’ve used ~[VA.gov](http://va.gov/)~ a little bit (once every few months).
> - I’ve used ~[VA.gov](http://va.gov/)~ a lot (at least monthly).
> - I am an expert on ~[VA.gov](http://va.gov/)~ (use weekly or daily).

5. If you have never logged into VA.gov before, would you be willing to create an identity-verified account during the session and provide your feedback on the website after signing in? Creating an account is a 5-10 minute process that requires a form of government identification. Your response will not disqualify you from the study.
> Response options: radio buttons
> - No, I don’t want to create a VA.gov account during my session.
> - Yes, I’d be willing to create a VA.gov account during my session. 


6. Do you find it difficult to remember or learn new things, focus on a task, or make decisions?**Note:** We ask this question because we want to make sure that our tools work for people who live with challenges like these.

> Response options: yes or no
> (Answering yes would qualify the participant to meet criteria for cognitive impairments)
