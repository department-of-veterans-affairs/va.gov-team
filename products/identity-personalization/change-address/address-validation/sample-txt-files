Feature: Address Validation Service
  As an address validation service, this service will provide methods to match, correct, and validate addresses via a spectrum address validation service
  
  - address_validation_1: Check for Malformed Request for Address Validation Service
  - address_validation_2: Fail request when it does not have enough information
  - address_validation_3: Fail a request when the stateProvince is longer than 255 characters
  - address_validation_4: Fail a request when the requestCountry is longer than 255 characters
  - address_validation_5: Address Validation Service returns AddressCouldNotFound message when spectrum can not validate a bad address
  - address_validation_6: Address Validation service returns the spectrum validation response with no error message when spectrum provides a validated address
  - address_validation_7: Return the same validation key for same valid address	
  - address_validation_8: Return different validation key different valid addresses
  - address_validation_9: Return same validation key for same invalid addresses	
  - address_validation_10: Return different validation key for different invalid addresses
  - address_validation_11: Return different validation key and confidence score for valid addresses with different addressLine2 inputs
  - address_validation_12: Return same validation key and confidence score for an address with only zipCode5 and having both with zipCode5,zipCode4
  - address_validation_13: Return same validation key and confidence score for international address which have at least city or postalCode
  - address_validation_14: Return different validation key and confidence score for international addresses with city and postal code values wrong
  - address_validation_15: Return message code with messageText for nonPostalInput
  - address_validation_16: Return message code with key for different errors <ScenarioID>
  - address_validation_17: The service receives and processes a valid request and returns different addressType <ScenarioID>
  - address_validation_18: Addresses with DPV of Y and S are considered valid correspondance addresses <ScenarioID>

    When the address validation service processes the request and sends it to spectrum
    Then spectrum returns a response with message
      | AddressLine1       | City    | StateProvince | Country.ISO | Status | Status.Code      | Status.Description |
      | 113 Washington Ave | Beckley |               | USA         | F      | UnableToValidate | Address Not Found  |
