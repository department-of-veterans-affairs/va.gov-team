# Research Plan for Authenticated Experience/Personalization: Candidate Address - Override

## Goals
1.  **What product & team are you doing this research for?**

Address Override.  Authenticated Experience/Personalization.

2.  **Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product?**

Vet360 is providing Address Validation.  There are several situations where the Veteran will need to make choices in order to properly select a more accurate address option or to override provided options.

This is sometimes due to the situations where Pitney Bowes Spectrum address database has not yet caught up to the cartographical realities of the US housing market,  and the Veteran should be able to confirm that "yes, this is actually a real address."

This Address Override feature requires UX in various places to allow the Veteran to complete their address edit workflow easily and accurately.
  1. Veteran enters accurate address.  If the entered address matches the database address with the highest Confidence Score, the updated address displays on the UI.
  2.  Veteran enters inaccurate address.  The UI will display the entered address and up to 3 address suggestions and allow the Veteran to edit the entered address or the Veteran is required to select 1 address to continue to complete the update.
  3.  Veteran enters inaccurate address that the database cannot identify.  The UI will display the entered address with no address suggestions and allow the user to edit the address or continue with the address override.
  
  We have clickable prototypes that map out each of the mentioned UX scenarios and we need user testing to answer several questions regarding the usability of the workflow and UI.

3.  **Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research?** 

- Is the messaging clear to the Veteran about their entered address if the system does not recognize it?
- Is it clear to the Veteran on how to proceed by selecting their entered address or an address suggestion?
- Is it clear to the Veteran what to do when the system has no address suggestions to display?
- Is it clear to the Veteran on how to edit their entered address?
- Is it clear to the Veteran that they can go back to the address suggestion screen before they confirm the address update?
- Does it cause the Veteran any confusion if the 'Continue/Update/Cancel' buttons on the mobile form?
- Is it clear to the Veteran that the address has been updated or cannot be updated?

4.  **Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research?**

- Veterans will understand how to edit their mailing address from their profile
- Veterans will understand why we display the alert if the system does not recognize their entered address
- Veterans will find it easier to make a choice if we select the best address suggestion option by default
- Veterans will be able to complete the process and feel confident their address has been updated


## Method
1.	**What method of research are you planning?** 
  
Usability testing with high fidelity prototypes. 
  
2.	**Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions?**

This usability testing will help us understand if there are any pain points or confusing elements to the 'update mailing address' workflow and how we can better optimize the UX.

3.	**Where are you planning to do your research?**

This research will be done remotely, using GoTo Meeting.

4.	**What will you be testing?** *(Design mocks, card sort, prototype, page, content, etc.)* 

InVision Prototype

5.  **If remote: What tool do you plan to use**

GoTo Meeting

## Participants and Recruitment
1.	**Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?**

We need **3 participants** that meet the following criteria:

- A woman
- A person of color
- 35 or under
- 55 or older

2.	**What is your recruitment strategy?**
