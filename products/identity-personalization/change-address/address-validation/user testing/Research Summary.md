Session 1:

- Add phone number to each "Invalid" screen
- Confusion why we tell someone their address is invalid but let them choose it anyway
- This may not be an issue with others, but the radio buttons were not clear to her. She didn't realize it as sometimes an option to choose the address she already entered. Though, I think this is an issue with how we were explaining things and not the radio button itself.
- Probably overall, we could clarify the copy. Make it clearer what "invalid" means. Make it clearer when and why they can override the address, and when and why they can not.
