# Conversation Guide: Address validation

### [Prototype](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/34UP5BMUAJF#/391945409_1-_Intro_Screen)

### Project-specific setup

- Have the prototype ready and minimized.
- Screenshare.
- Be ready to share computer and mouse controls

## Intro (2 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Samara and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about updating your address at the VA.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 – 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** If you've had a frustrating experience or find something we show you to be confusing, we want to hear about it. Your honest insights help us to figure out how we can improve the veteran experience, and we will not be offended by any opinions you express.
- **In this session, we will be looking at a prototype.** This means that we are looking at something that looks like a real website, but it functions a bit differently. For example, some links will work while other links won't. This is for the purpose of testing so we can focus on observing specific tasks. Do you have any questions about this or what a prototype is? 
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

## Warm-up Questions (5 minutes)

1. Before we start, can you tell me a little bit about yourself? (If stuck, prompt to ask about service experience, where they live, their work).

*Share screen and start recording.*

OK, now I am going to turn on the recording.

2. Do you receive benefits from the VA? 
- (If yes) May I ask which benefits?
3. Since receiving benefits from the VA, have you ever had to update your mailing address? 
- (If yes) Can you tell me about this experience?
4. Since receiving benefits from the VA, was there ever a time when you were not receiving mail you expected to receive from the VA? Did you ever find out why you weren't receiving this mail?
- If yes, figure out if this was because they had the wrong address on file.
- If applicable, ask how they figured out they needed to update their address with the VA. 
- Depending on the answer here, ask them about how we could better help them to keep their address up to date.
5. Have you ever signed in to VA.gov before? (If yes) About how often do you use the website?

## First Task: Address validation with override and suggestions (10 minutes)

Alright, now I am going to share keyboard and mouse controls and we are going to walk through the prototype.

(*Intro screen*) First, I just want to reiterate that this is a prototype... OK, when you're ready, please click "Go to the Prototype."

We are starting from the VA.gov homepage.

1. What would you do if you needed to change the address the VA had on file for you?
2. (*On Profile*) Now we are on the VA.gov profile. How would you change your mailing address?
3. (*On the Edit form*) Since this is a prototype, we are going to simulate typing in a new address by having you click into any of the fields in this form. That will update the whole address. (*On the updated form*) OK, now you have entered a new address. How would you save it?

(*Address validation section*)

1. Now we are looking at a screen that says "Your address update isn't valid." What do you think this means?
2. Why do you think you are being told your address isn't valid? Why do you think you are seeing this screen?
3. What do you think will happen if you click Edit Address?
4. What do you think "Suggested Addresses" are? Where did they come from?
5. Under "Suggested Addresses," why are some parts of the address highlighted blue?
6. How would you select the address you want to move forward with?
- What if you wanted to select the original address you entered?
7. Now that you have selected your address, please show me how you would save it.

(*On Confirm screen*)

1. Why do you think you are being shown this screen?
2. What do you think will happen if you click "View Suggested Addresses?" Why do you think we give you the option to view suggested addresses?

OK, please save your new address.

Alright, I have a few follow-up questions for you:

1. What could be improved about the process we just looked at?
- Do you have any questions about the process we just looked at?
2. What did you find to be clear and easy to understand?

## Second Task: Address validation with override but without suggestions (5 minutes)

Alright, now we are going to go through a similar process like we just went through, but it will be a little bit different this time.

First, please go to update your mailing address again. (*In modal after they click Edit*) Like before, please click into any field to update your address, and then save it.

(*On confirm screen*)

1. It looks like this address came up as invalid again, but this screen looks a little different than the last one. Can you tell me more about what you see and what's different than last time?
2. Why do you think there are no suggested addresses?
3. Tell me what you think your options are at this point.
4. What would you do next?

OK, please save your address. (*On confirm screen*) OK, please confirm and save.

## Third Task: Address validation without override but with suggestions (5 minutes)

Again, now we are going to go through a similar process like we just went through. We've got two more scenarios we are going to look at.

Like before, please go to update your mailing address again. (*In modal after they click Edit*) and click into any field to update your address, and then save it.

(*On confirm screen*)

1. Like before, the address you entered has came up as invalid, but this screen looks a little different than the last two we looked at. Can you tell me more about what you see and what's different than last time?
2. Why do you think you can't choose the address you originally entered?
3. What would you do if the address you entered was indeed correct but you were not able to save it?
4. Tell me what you think your options are at this point.
5. What would you do next?

OK, please save your address. (*On confirm screen*) OK, please confirm and save.

## Fourth Task: Address validation without override but with NO suggestions (5 minutes)

We are going to go through one more scenario. Like before, please go to update your mailing address again. (*In modal after they click Edit*) and click into any field to update your address, and then save it.

(*On confirm screen*)

1. Like before, the address you entered has came up as invalid, but this screen looks a little different than the rest. Can you tell me more about what you see and what's different than last time?
2. Why do you think you can't choose the address you originally entered?
3. What would you do if the address you entered was indeed correct but you were not able to save it?
4. Tell me what you think your options are at this point.
5. What would you do next?

OK, please go to edit your address. (on Edit form) Click into any field to update the address, and show me how you would save it.

## Post-testing questions (2 minutes)

OK, those are all the screens we are going to look at today.

1. Overall, how could we improve the different scenarios we looked at today?
- (If they need clarification — "the process of telling people their addresses aren't valid and the process of suggesting alternatives")
2. What did you think was clear/what worked well?
3. What questions do you have for me?

## Thank-You and Closing (1 minute)

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

As a thank you for your participation, we'd like to send you a $50 thank-you check. This will be sent by (Brian/Shannon from) Perigean, the people that recruited you to talk to us today. They'll work with you to figure out the right place to send it.

Any questions before we sign off?

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
