### Project-specific setup

For this research session, we will be asking users to share their screen and walk through a high fidelity clickable prototype of the Va.gov profile screen to edit/update the mailing address.

- Sign in: no sign in required

## Intro (2 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Arthur and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about how you edit your mailing address from the profile screen.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 10-15 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** If you've had a frustrating experience or find something we show you to be confusing, we want to hear about it. Your honest insights help us to figure out how we can improve the veteran experience, and we will not be offended by any opinions you express.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** For this session, I will have you share your screen and ask you to show us how you edit your mailing address. Just so you know, these recordings are not shared outside of the people on this call. We use them only to confirm that we have captured what you have said accurately, and then we delete them a few weeks after the session. Do you have any questions about this? Are you ok if we record today?

## Transfer presenter controls to participant (2 minutes)

OK, before we start the session or start our recording, we need to pass presenter controls to you. I'm going go ahead and do that now. If you are not already using the desktop application for GTM, you will be asked to download it.

*Pass presenter rights*

## Warm-up Questions (2 minutes)

OK,let's get started.

1. First, can you tell me a little bit about yourself? (If stuck, prompt to ask about service experience, where they live, their work).

OK, now I am going to turn on the recording.

*Start recording.*

2. Do you have a VA.gov account? If so, about how often do you use the website?
3. Do you sign-in into your account to make changes regularly?
4. Have you updated your mailing address at any time?
5. Were you able to update your mailing address easily and quickly?

## Edit Mailing Address ( 5 - 10 minutes)

**Since these will be high fidelity prototypes of the dashboard and edit mailing address screens, we do not require a sign-in or LOA3.**

Begin on dashboard screen:

1. Can you show me how you would edit your mailing address?

Form screen displays:

2. Please click through the form, as this is a prototype, we won't have you input any information

Alert / Address Selection screen:

3. This screen has an alert - is is clear why we show the alert?  Is the alert messaging clear as to what is happening?
4. Please select an address option to continue

Update screen:

5.  Please go back to the alert/address suggestion screen (have the user return to the Update screen)
6.  Update your mailing address

Assess the following:

- Their flow, and if they can locate the 'edit' feature easily
- Their flow as they click through the edit address workflow
- What their pain points are.
- What we could improve overall to make this experience easier/better.

(If time, and if it feels productive, ask about their experiences with other address update workflows on other systems)


## Post-Task Interview (1 minute)

1. Overall, how did you feel about all of the screens we looked at today?
2. In addition to anything you have already mentioned, how could this overall experience be improved?

## Thank-You and Closing - (1 minute)

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

As a thank you for your participation, we'd like to send you a $50 thank-you check. This will be sent by (Brian/Shannon from) Perigean, the people that recruited you to talk to us today. They'll work with you to figure out the right place to send it.

Any questions before we sign off?

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
