## **My VA recommendations**

### **UX improvements**

1. Popups and modals were found to be disruptive to a blind user. Keep an eye on when and how we’re triggering modals on My VA.  
2. On the current My VA experience we link to prescriptions, travel pay, labs, and appointments, but users frequently mention they cannot find this information. Consider usability testing with health care users on the live site, or using Real User Monitoring (RUM) to evaluate user paths for health care tasks to find areas of opportunity.  
3. Consider exploring options to direct users to the Forms tool and Document uploader that stay within our requirements of being dynamic and personalized to the user.

### **Feedback supporting My VA 3.0**

4. Users mentioned wanting MORE information, not less, in relation to claims and appeals and appointments.  
5. Users frequently were looking for letters and documents, including the DD214, and dependents from the My VA page.

### **Process improvements**

6. Ensure the call center has up to date information on timelines.  
   1. User was informed by the call center that they’d be able to add an international phone number to their account by end of August, but the feature is not implemented yet, which led to frustration.  
7. Ensure additional user documentation, such as letters or emails, matches site actions.  
   1. User was directed to the website to upload documents in support of a claim but found no way to do so.

### **Data improvements**

8. Data reliability continues to be a recurring theme with My VA. Users frequently report slow load times as well as incorrect or missing personal information. Continue to make efforts to reduce load times, and work with other teams to drive data quality improvements.

### **Bugs**

9. (7 total) Health care section:  
   1. (3) Secure messages not loading, or messages going to the wrong center. (Known bug.)  
   2. (2) Unable to access lab results.  
   3. Unable to schedule health care appointments.  
   4. Unable to access the travel page.  
10. (3) Forms and applications section:  
    1. VR\&E form and 10-10EZ form ‘stuck’ in draft mode. This could be a bug, user error, or system status. Recommend we QA these forms.  
    2. On the Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD) form one user mentioned that the edit link directed them to the Intent to file form. Recommend we QA this form.  
11. (2) Claims were not showing on My VA. (Known bug.)  
12. Reached out to Ask VA about education benefits. Received email to log on to Ask VA. Was directed to My HealtheVet.  
13. Unable to complete the 526ez form because there’s a missing field on page 3 of 5\. Had to file the form manually.

## **Profile recommendations**

### **UX improvements**

1. New section considerations  
   1. Consider research on user interest in accessing their in progress and completed claims from profile verses My VA.  
   2. Consider research on the addition of a benefits review and eligibility section of profile or My VA.  
2. New feature considerations  
   1. Strongly consider allowing users to update their personal health care contacts.  
   2. Continue to advocate for caretaker and dependent access so they can support Veterans.  
   3. Consider providing a way for Veterans to opt out of all paper mail.  
   4. Consider providing users an easy way to delete their accounts.  
   5. Consider allowing users to add their spouse or dependent as back up contacts to their profiles.  
   6. Consider allowing Veterans to break their payments into separate accounts.  
   7. Consider adding new notifications:  
      1. Text option for new lab results.  
      2. Email option for secure messages.  
      3. Both options for new letters in account.  
3. Feature improvement considerations  
   1. Consider allowing users to enter non alphabetic characters into preferred name.  
   2. Consider allowing users to add an alternate email address.  
   3. Consider allowing users to add a temporary mailing or home address.  
   4. Consider allowing users to opt out of all text or email notifications.  
4. Update content considerations  
   1. Provide users clear direction on how to update or remove their accredited representative or VSO.  
   2. Confirm that instructions on how to update legal name and date of birth are up to date on profile.  
   3. Consider addition of content for those whose accounts have been recently compromised and what to do.  
5. Usability considerations  
   1. Be mindful of pop-ups as they can be disruptive to users as they’re attempting to complete their tasks.

### **Feedback supporting Profile 2.0**

6. Users were looking for a way to access their health care  information, dependents, and letters and documents from their profile.  
7. Users continue to need a way to add an international phone number to their account. Especially those deployed out of country.  
8. User was confused on which accounts direct deposit would update and were looking for better information on the topic.

### **Process improvements**

9. Continue to work with DoD on implementing a process for updating Veteran service history information.  
10. Ensure additional user documentation, such as letters or emails, matches site actions.  
    1. Users are receiving letters directing them to upload a cancelled check to VA.gov because their accounts are invalid due to not having a cancelled check on file. It does not seem as though instructions were provided with the letter, so users are coming to profile. Letters were received around September 8th.  
       1. *“I received a letter from the VA which stated I needed to provide a copy of a canceled check. If so, how can I upload the cancelled check when I’m updating the direct deposit information?”*  
       2. *“I received a letter telling me my direct deposit information was invalid because you do not have a copy of a cancelled check.”*  
       3. *“Letter 9/8/2025 said my request to update Direct Deposit information failed because I did not attached a voided check or deposit slip. There seems to be no way to do this on the site.”*  
    2. Users were directed to profile to validate their contact information. But many were confused when there was no validate or confirm button.  
       1. Some mentioned that they had confirmed their information but were still being contacted to confirm. Which caused confusion and frustration.  
11. Ensure call center information is up to date so they can provide the best feedback to users on next steps.  
    1. The call center does not have direction on blocked user accounts. Consider providing them and the user better direction on what to do in these situations.  
    2. One user mentioned being told to update their personal health care contact online, but that option is not available. Provide the call center with up to date information so they can direct the user to the correct path.

### **Data improvements**

12. Continue work on improving Veteran Status Card logic so that more Veterans can easily access their card.  
13. Follow-up with Identity to see if bugs with redirect are a common occurrence and if that is something we can fix.  
14. Continue to find ways to improve latency and load times on profile.
