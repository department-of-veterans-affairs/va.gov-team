## Background

Currently there are three primary ways veterans can login to VA digital properties: 

•	DS Logon
•	ID.me
•	My HealtheVet

Each have different credentialing requirements, levels of security, ease of user experience, and different VA digital properties use different login systems. This means veterans must go through several different credentialing processes to get access to the benefits they’ve earned. Users are unable to have one seamless experience.  In addition, in order to access a veteran’s account information, a caregiver and/or beneficiary must have the veteran login themselves to access their benefits.

## Who the government stakeholders?

## What are their priorities currently?

•	Delegation
•	DS Logon is a barrier to access
•	Password requirements are burdensome
•	Veterans and caregivers desire a single, better system
•	Veterans want secure, trustworthy systems
•	Caregivers lack the access they need
•	DS Logon is perceived as outdated and dysfunctional
•	Login support
•	Mobile access
•	Veterans have little memory of account set-up


## How might our (Platform) priorities be similar or different?
