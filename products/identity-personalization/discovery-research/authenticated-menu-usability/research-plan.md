# Research Plan for Authenticated Experience, Authenticated Menu, January 2024

## Background

VA.gov is piloting a new design for a standard header later this year, which includes a significant change to the placement of the authenticated menu on mobile: instead of the authenticated menu labeled with the user's name appearing in the upper-right corner of the screen, it will now be nested under a general “Menu” button which reveals the complete site navigation. 

This new design coincides with continued expansion work our team is planning for this menu. Last year, we observed high engagement with two links we added: Letters and Dependents. We want to explore how we can further increase engagement and improve Veteran’s access their most important tasks.

### OCTO Priorities 

Which [OCTO priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202023.md) does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.

### Veteran Journey
Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)?
Are there moments that matter? 

## Research Goals	
1. We want to learn how the new design helps Veterans find their authenticated menu options, especially on mobile.
2. We want to learn about Veteran expectations for an authenticated menu.

### Outcome
The research applies at any stage from Starting Up through Aging, since it investigates global parts of the VA.gov site that provide access to the whole spectrum of VA.gov benefits and tools.

### Research questions
1. Does the new menu design introduce any usability hurdles, particularly on mobile?
2. What do Veterans expect to see under a logged-in user menu?
3. Do the links we're proposing for the authenciated menu make sense to Veterans?
4. How we can differentiate our logged-in user menu item from the non-personalized items on mobile?

### Hypothesis
1. When describing expectations for a user menu:
   - Profile will be a mentioned consistently. 
   - No one will specifically mention “My VA” by name, but will describe some kind of comprehensive dashboard.
   - The rest of the items metioned will be varied and highly specific to the person’s experience with VA. 
3. The authenticated menu will be easy for people to find when their name is in the header.
4. People will initially struggle to find their authenticated menu when it’s collapsed under the main menu, but will easily understand what it is once they see their name.
5. In the prototype, people will understand what the links in their authenticated menu point to.

## Methodology	
We’ll conduct a remote interview consisting of two parts:
1. A simple co-design exercise where we ask participants to create their ideal authenticated menu, with the goal of understanding their expectations without priming them.
2. A usability test to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed standardized header design.

### Location
The sessions will be conducted remotely via Zoom.

## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach
We’d like use Perigean to recruit 12 Veterans for a total of 8 completed sessions.

### Recruitment criteria
Recruit 12 Veterans for a total of 8 completed sessions.

#### All participants 
* Must be Veterans
* Must currently receive at least 1 benefit or service from VA
* Have a working microphone on their device
* Have Zoom downloaded to their device prior to the session

#### Some participants

##### Experience with VA Benefits and services
- 6 participants must NOT currently receive health care through VA (if this is challenging, we can reduce to 4, but let’s shoot for 6)

##### Demographics
* 4 participants should be over 55
* 6 participants should identify as other than Caucasian
* 6 participants should identify as a gender other than male
* 4 participants should have no college degree
* No more than 4 participants should have a Master’s degree or higher

##### Accessibility and inclusion
* 4 participants should identify as having a cognitive impairment
* 8 participants should be able to join the session from a mobile device
* 4 participants should be able to join the session from a desktop device
* 3 participants should require a screenreader to use their device: 
  * At least 2 need to be on a mobile device (e.g. VoiceOver on iPhone or TalkBack on Android)
* 2 participants should require zoom magnification to use their device

#### Screener questions
1. Are you able to join the Zoom session from a smart phone such as a Samsung Galaxy or Apple iPhone? Any kind of smart phone will work, as long as it connects to the internet. (Answer should be yes to satisfy criteria for 8 mobile users)

> Response options: yes or no

2. What VA benefits or services do you currently receive?

>  Response options, checkbox list with text box: 
> - Health care
> - Payments from VA (for example, disability compensation or pension)
> - Education benefits
> - Other (please list)

3. Do you find it difficult to remember or learn new things, focus on a task, or make decisions?**Note:** We ask this question because we want to make sure that our tools work for people who live with challenges like these.

> Response options: yes or no
> (Answering yes would qualify the participant to meet criteria for cognitive impairments)

4. Do you need to use screen reader technology to use your phone or computer such as VoiceOver on an iPhone, TalkBack on an Android, or JAWS? **Note:** We ask this question because we want to make sure that our website works for people who rely on these types of technologies.

> Response options: yes or no

(Proceed to question 4a if yes)

4a.  We want to make sure our website works for people with various levels of experience with screen readers. Please rate your experience level using a screen reader:

> Response options:  Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert

(This answer won’t influence whether or not they qualify, but will be helpful to have on the tracker and for scheduling)

4b. Are you willing to join the Zoom session using this assistive technology? (Answer should be yes to satisfy criteria for screen reader)

> Response options: yes or no
	
4c. Please tell us what kind of screen reader you use, and if you’ll join the session from a mobile device or computer:

> Response option: text box

5. Do you normally need to resize font or use magnification software to see your screen when you are using your computer or mobile device?  If you use a physical magnifying tool like a magnifying glass, answer no. **Note:** We ask this question because we want to make sure that our website works for people who rely on digital magnification technologies.

> Response options: yes or no

(Proceed to question 5a if yes)

5a.  Please tell us what kind of magnification tool you use, and if you’ll join the session from a mobile device or computer:
