# Findings Summary for Federal Header Authenticated Menu
February 7, 2024

Liz Lantz, Authenticated Experience

## Background
VA.gov is piloting a new design for a standard header later this year, which includes a significant change to the placement of the authenticated menu on mobile: instead of the authenticated menu labeled with the user's name appearing in the upper-right corner of the screen, **it will now be nested under a general “Menu” button which reveals the complete site navigation**. 

The Sitewide team, who is managing the new design, conducted research in parallel on the unauthenticated version of this menu ([research findings report](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/header-footer/initiatives/2024-federal-standardized-header-footer/research/research-findings-phases1%262.md)), and our research fulfilled Phase 3 of their work.  

This new design coincided with continued expansion work our team planned for this menu. Last year, we observed high engagement with two links we added: Letters and Dependents. We wanted to explore how we could further increase engagement and improve Veteran’s access to their most important tasks.

### OCTO Priorities
This research aligns with the following [OCTO priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202023.md)
* Solidify the VA.gov platform
* Refresh VA.gov homepage and IA

### OFCIO Priorities
This research aligns with the [21st Century IDEA](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/M-23-22-Delivering-a-Digital-First-Public-Experience.pdf).
* Create a consistent user experience across government websites by creating a standardized header/footer that contributes back to the USWDS
### Veteran Journey
The research applies at any stage from Starting Up through Aging, since it investigates global parts of the VA.gov site that provide access to the whole spectrum of VA.gov benefits and tools.

## Research Goals and Approach
1. We want to learn how the new design helps Veterans find their authenticated menu options, especially on mobile.
2. We want to learn about Veteran expectations for an authenticated menu.

### Research questions
1. Does the new menu design introduce any usability hurdles, particularly on mobile?
2. What do Veterans expect to see under a logged-in user menu?
3. Does the new link we're proposing for the authenticated menu make sense to Veterans?
4. How we can differentiate our logged-in user as a personalized menu on mobile?

### Methodology and Participants
- We conducted our sessions remotely, using Zoom.
- The sessions started by having participants complete tasks in a CodePen prototype, and then moved to a prioritization exercise where we asked them to rank the items in the authenticated menu. 
- We changed the order of our tasks for the last 6 sessions, so that the first task would be to find an item that is conventionally under a personal menu (profile). We did this because:
  - No one easily found the authenticated menu in the first 6 sessions. 
  - We wondered if it was because the first two tasks in our protocol asked them to find items that weren’t intuitive to find in a personal menu. 
- We talked to 12 participants in total (review the Appendix for detailed demographic information)
  - 4 participants evaluated the **desktop view of the header**. All used a form of assistive technology
  - 8 evaluated the **mobile view of the header**
## Findings
1. 8 of 12 participants struggled to find the authenticated menu. ([Link](#8-of-12-participants-struggled-to-find-the-authenticated-menu))
2. 3 of 8 participants on mobile devices expected their name, and access to their profile, in the right corner of the header. ([Link](#3-of-8-participants-on-mobile-devices-expected-to-find-their-name-and-access-to-their-profile-in-the-right-corner-of-the-header))
3. The authenticated menu label button was unclear to some participants. ([Link](#the-authenticated-menu-label-button-was-unclear-to-some-participants))
4. 2 screenreader users missed the navigation entirely. ([Link](#2-screenreader-users-missed-the-navigation-entirely))
5. Most participants did not expect to find disability rating in their authenticated menu, but they weren't bothered by it being there. ([Link](#most-participants-did-not-expect-to-find-disability-rating-in-their-authenticated-menu-but-they-werent-bothered-by-it-being-there))
6. 4 participants thought the label “Letters” was ambiguous. ([Link](#4-participants-thought-the-label-letters-was-ambiguous))
7. There's a lack of understanding about My VA, but people find it valuable once they understand what it is. ([Link](#theres-a-lack-of-understanding-about-my-va-but-people-find-it-valuable-once-they-understand-what-it-is))
8. Participants were drawn to the footer, sometimes before the main navigation. ([Link](#participants-were-drawn-to-the-footer-sometimes-before-the-main-navigation))
## Findings Details
### 8 of 12 participants struggled to find the authenticated menu.
#### Desktop view (4 participants total)
* 2 screenreader participants had to be guided to the menu button and completely missed the navigation elements on the page.
  * One followed the first research protocol
  * One followed the revised protocol, where the profile task was first.
* 1 screenreader participant was completely unfamiliar with web pages and we did not ask them to try to find them menu on their own.
* 1 participant using CCTV noticed the authenticated menu immediately because seeing their name drew their attention. 
#### On mobile (8 participants total)
* 3/8 did not find the menu without being guided by the moderator.  All of these sessions took place before we changed our protocol.
  > *Moderator guides participant to open main menu*.
  > 
  > M: Do you see the option that says [participant’s first name]?
  > 
  > P3: I do not see that. I see, *pauses* oh god, oh I’m staring right at it. I’m sorry, I didn’t see that before...It’s in a different form than the rest of the page. If it were highlighted with a blue background like the other choices are, I probably would have clicked on it right away.

  > P2: It just didn't catch my eye, it looks like a banner of some sort. Or a separator between the logo and the menu.
  > 
  > M: *goes back to prototype and opens auth menu.* You were saying this looks like a banner? *mouses over collapsed auth menu.*
  > 
  > P2: Yeah, just a separator. Just information. If you can see below the menu, there's information that's not clickable [referring to main page content on white background]. It looked like information, like it was something I couldn't do anything with. I see the plus sign now, but it didn't strike me as a button, you know, something clickable.

* 3/8 found the menu without being guided, but initially expected it to be in the upper right corner of their screen.
  * 2 did not notice the authenticated menu until the 3rd time they opened the main menu, when they were asked to complete a profile-related task. Both followed the first protocol 
  > I would expect, this, where it says [participant’s first name], I think general convention, I'm used to seeing that in the top right corner. Google and many others have your profile in the top right corner. I was looking to the right of the Department of Veterans Affairs logo for my picture, my profile picture and my name. - P2
  * The other participant followed the second protocol, but clicked on the VA logo before opening the menu. When we asked why, they shared: 

  > Because when I looked at the page, normally It has like my google symbol or something on the right side. And it has my name, so I know that if I hit on my name then that's my profile. When I didn't see it, and it just says "sign out", I figured the U.S.A. government sign, that should take me to the home page which should also open the place for me to able for me to be able to go in and change my phone number. - P16


* 2 participants easily opened the menu for the first task, after we changed our protocol.
  * One of these participants first clicked the sign out button by mistake before finding the menu button.  
  * For the subsequent task, find your disability rating, 1 of the 2 participants had to be guided back to the menu. They had not recalled seeing that option in the menu.

### 3 of 8 participants on mobile devices expected to find their name, and access to their profile, in the right corner of the header.
They were able to find the authenticated menu under the main menu, but talked about expecting to have more direct access to their profile, and being used to seeing their name on the screen.
> When I looked at the page, normally It has like my google symbol or something on the top right side. And it has my name, so I know that if I hit on my name then that's my profile. When I didn't see it, and it just says "sign out", I figured the U.S.A. government sign, that should take me to the home page which should also open the place for me to able for me to be able to go in and change my phone number. - P16

> It would be helpful if it wasn’t in the menu, just to have it omnipresent on the screen. They're usually in the top right or top left, so that if you clicked on them, it brings you to the straight to the profile. - P1

### The authenticated menu label button was unclear to some participants.
- When screenreaders read out “*[First name], button, menu*” or “*[First name], button, pop-up*”, participants weren’t sure what to expect. 
  > My name is there. But normally it would say first name, and then it would say last name. But it just says [my first name] What am I supposed to do with that? I don't understand.  - P4
- 3 participants guessed pressing the button would reveal profile information about themselves, like their name or contact information.
  > Thought when it said [first name] pop up that my information would pop up with my information and telephone number. - P8

- 1 participant renamed their authenticated menu to “My Profile” during our design exercise.
  >   P: Why wouldn't you consider just calling that [authenticated menu] "My profile”?…That's really clear to me. Otherwise it's just saying "we know who you are". That to me, my two cents is that just seems more clear there, on what to do with it. - P2

### 2 screenreader users missed the navigation entirely.
- 1 participant used JAWS shortcuts to navigate by headings or links, so they missed the `<button>` elements that open our menus.
- 1 participant with very little web experience used the “Skip to content” link to get to the main section of the site and skipped the navigation that way.
- The moderator eventually had to guide these participants to the header and navigation of the prototype.
- When asked, they stated that they did this to familiarize themselves with the page they were on, and they expected navigation links in a menu to be available through these methods.
### Most participants did not expect to find disability rating in their authenticated menu, but they weren’t bothered by it being there.
> It still wouldn’t have been in my thought process that disability and letters were there. This usually has things like settings, your email address, contacts and things like that. - P1

- Only 2 participants, both on mobile devices, went straight to the authenticated menu to find the link. 
  - They had already seen the menu, and had recalled seeing it previously. 
  - Some participants who had seen the authenticated menu for a previous task did not return to the authenticated menu to find their disability rating, suggesting they either didn’t see it or didn’t remember seeing it.
- Reactions to having this link in their menu were mostly positive. 
  - 2 participants felt it was redundant if they could also see the rating on My VA or in their profile, and removed it from their menu during the design exercise.
  - 5 participants moved it higher up in their menu. There wasn’t a consistent ranking to where they placed it.
  - People who didn’t need the link weren’t bothered by having it there, because they understood the importance of that information to other Veterans.
  > *Moderator and participant are prioritizing authenticated menu items according to participant’s needs.* 
  > 
  > P3: Yeah, I don't use any of that. So I'm, I I'm not familiar with it. 
  > 
  > M: Would you want to have a link to that in your menu then? Maybe we should get rid of it. 
  > 
  > P3: Oh, certainly for the people that that use those services, yes, it should be there. 

### 4 participants thought the label “Letters” was ambiguous.
People who had not previously needed a proof of service or benefit letter were not sure where this link would go. Most guessed the link would take them to a page where they could get copies of correspondence between them and VA.

> P4: What's Letters?
> 
> M: That's a great question. What do you think it is?
> 
> P4: It has no relevance to me at all. *Laughs.* Letters of what?

> Letters, the only thing is that it's ambiguous. Letters, what letters? Is that where I send a letter to the VA? Is that where I look for communication from the VA? But what about, is there where I get my specific letters, say like your eligibility rating, your COE? It's just vague. - P1

### There's a lack of understanding about My VA, but people find it valuable once they understand what it is.
* 11 participants didn’t understand what My VA was until the moderator explained it. We heard a variety of guesses as to what would be shown if they clicked on the link:
  * Their VAMC facility information
  * A general page containing VA general resources on various topics such as health care, job listings, and how to work with VA.
  * Military information and a list of the VA websites they were a “member of” (had logins for).
  * A personalized place to get information about benefits they’re eligible for.
  * All personalized benefit information *except* health care.
* Multiple participants referred to it as a type of homepage.
* Even with explanation, one participant struggled to understand the difference between My VA and the user profile.
  > Why do you need both? Because that may be confusing to some people. You have My VA, you really wouldn't need both. You need one or the other. - P4
* In the design exercise, we asked people to order the menu items in order of importance to them. 2 people deprioritized My VA before they understood what it was.  Once they understood it, they moved it to the top of their authenticated menu. 
  > Had I known that [it was a dashboard], I’d rank it higher. I’d put it first. Above profile. - P8

### Participants were drawn to the footer, sometimes before the main navigation.
- 6/12 participants looked in the footer to complete a task.
  - 4 participants first looked in the “Information for” and “More Resources” sections of the footer, before opening the main menu.  It seemed like they expected to be able to find any information about themselves in those sections because the heading name was so general.
  - In particular, screenreader participants continued to end up in the footer when navigating the prototype by headings or links. The screenreader didn’t announce they were in a footer, so it was unclear to them where they were on the page.
- This is possibly a factor of the short home page of our prototype causing people to encounter the footer quickly when scrolling down the mobile page. However, screenreader users navigating via headings and links also returned to the footer repeatedly while attempting to complete tasks.
## Other takeaways
- **On mobile, the placement of the sign out button might increase accidental sign outs or delay people en route to personalized tasks.** 
  - 2 people accidentally signed themselves out during the session. We didn’t dig into why during the session, but hypothesize it is because they’re used to going to that space to access a menu.
  - P16 first said, “I would, uh, oh no, that says sign out” while looking for their profile. They later explained they were looking in that space for a link to their profile.
  - Since we don’t currently have a sign out button exposed in the heading, this will be a big change for people and potential pain point given the challenges folks have signing into the site.
  - If we’re not already doing so, we should think about ways to prevent accidental sign out, and be sure we track interactions with the button. 
- **7 links feels like a good maximum for the authenticated menu.** 
  - 2 participants pared down their menu to our original three items: My VA, My HealtheVet, and Profile. 
    - This was based on their assumption that all other links were also available on My VA, so they wanted to eliminate redundancy. 
    - They didn’t pare down the list out of a sense of overwhelm or confusion.
  - At least 3 participants commented that any more options would be too many.
- **Participants expected to find proof of benefit letters in the benefit hub related to that benefit, or the reason they needed that document.** 
  - At least 2 expected it was not possible to get a proof of health care and disability benefits in the same letter, and that they’d need to go to different parts of the site.
  - Some participants went to “Housing” because the task was framed around needing a a document showing proof of service and benefits to get a property tax reduction.
  - One participant expected to find letters about disability on the same page where they’d view their rated disabilities.
- **People have low expectations of IA, personalization, and mobile experiences on government websites.** Multiple people made comments about how hard they expect government websites to be to navigate, especially on mobile devices. They were pleasantly surprised by what they saw in our prototype.
- **Disability rating is extremely critical for some Veterans**. Some participants talked about how disability rating impacts everything at VA, and commented that they appreciated seeing it in their name tag, and in the authenticated menu. One participant got anxious when they saw mock-data for disability rating in the prototype.
- **Multiple participants talked about expecting to find dependents in their profile.**  We’ve talked about adding it in the past, and this is a good datapoint to look back on if we revisit that idea in the future.

## Recommendations
### Revisit the design and placement of the authenticated menu on mobile.
The data from this study suggests we should consider moving the authenticated menu out of the general menu, and into the header of the website where the design currently has the sign-out button.  As an MVP alternative, we should reconsider updating the design so it’s more consistent with the other items in the collapsed menu.
*Supported by findings 1, 2, and other takeaways.*

### Dig into the markup for the header navigation, authenticated menu button, and footer
The problems we saw may be due to how the prototype was coded, and won’t be present when we go to production.  However, we should still dig into the issues we saw, and make sure our HTML mark up can support screenreader users when we launch the new header. This is especially true for beginning screenreader users or folks who simply do not use the web frequently (it’s hard to believe, but there are people out there! One in this study could not recall ever logging into a website.). The specific things the data in this study suggests we should look into are:
1. How can screenreader users understand our site navigation if they navigate a page only by links or headings?
2. How can we better set expectations about what the authenticated menu button does?
3. How can we make the footer more clear to screenreader users navigating by headings and links?

*Supported by findings 3, 4, and 8.*

### Keep disability rating in the authenticated menu.
Although it wasn’t intuitive for people to look in the authenticated menu to find their disability rating, almost all participants appreciated having it there once they saw it.  Some even moved it to the first or second item in their authenticated menu because it was so important to them.  

Those that didn’t have a disability rating, or had a permanent rating, weren’t bothered by having the link there because they understood the importance of that information to other Veterans.  10/12 participants felt that having 6-7 items in their menu was appropriate, so we can infer that having the link in the menu is not causing people to become confused or overwhelmed.
*Supported by finding 5.*

### Consider making the label for the Letters link more specific.
4/12 people were confused about where this would go, and interpreted to related to VA correspondence.  It’s worth reconsidering the label to see if we can make its purpose more clear. We’ve seen high engagement with this link since we added it to the authenticated menu; cross-referencing clicks in the menu with engagement analytics on the letters tool could help us determine whether or not people are finding what they expect when they land there.
*Supported by finding 6.*

### We should consider changing how we’re telling Veterans about My VA.
This study demonstrated two important things:
1. The name My VA alone is not enough to clue new users into the personalization features, or distinguish it from the user profile. 
2. People find My VA valuable once they understand what it is.

We should think about how we tell Veterans about My VA, including the name of the product, and whether or not changing what we're doing today aligns with broader Account Experience and OCTO goals. Educating veterans about the functionality of this tool and featuring it more prominently on the site would likely improve a Veteran’s ability to get to their critical tasks, and it could even convince more Veterans to use VA.gov over analog interactions with VA.

### Monitor footer interactions, and consider adding min-height to VA.gov. 
The issues we saw with people being overly reliant on the footer could have been due to the short page height, which caused people to encounter the footer sooner. Combined with the height of the footer (more than the heading and main content combined), it’s not surprising it drew people’s attention.

It’s worth considering adding a site wide min-height to the website if we see a focus on the footer a trend that emerges in other research, or in analytics.
