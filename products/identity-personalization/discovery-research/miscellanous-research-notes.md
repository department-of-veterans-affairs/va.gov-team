# Miscellaneous research notes

**Last update:** 12/20/2023

Many times, we hear feedback and observe behaviors about the authenticated experience in research studies that are meaningful, but not related to the main goals of the research study.  This means they're probably not captured in a findings report we can refer to later.

This is a doc to capture these things for now. Enjoy HQ will probably be a better place for this document once the whole team has access to it.

## Personalization

- In the **Nov 2023 Find a Rep user test** ([research folder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/accredited-representation-management/research/2023-11-ARM-findarep-nav-usertest)) P5 talked about conversations they have while helping older Veterans navigate VA online. The folks they help want to only see information about them. The participant laughed and doesn''t think its realistic, but stated that it would be wonderful for VA.gov to be personalized to them.

  > They say “well I want to know what my benefits are. So when I log on, I want it to say my benefits”. *Laughs* I tell them that’s not realistic. What they do, they try to make it easier for you to find what you need, and that is great. 

  > If we could have a magic world where your log in links to what you always do or what you commonly do, wouldn’t that be awesome? I only use it for prescriptions, for example. Well then my log in, when I login, should just be prescriptions and it doesn’t need all that other fluffy stuff.


## Signing into VA.gov

- In the **Nov 2023 Find a Rep user test** ([research folder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/accredited-representation-management/research/2023-11-ARM-findarep-nav-usertest)) P5 attempted to sign into the website immediately upon landing on it. The moderator didn't ask them to sign in, and stopped them, but this suggests signing in immediately upon arriving on the site is a regular pattern for this person.
  
## Navigation

### Personalized Tasks
- In the **Nov 2023 Find a Rep user test** ([research folder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/accredited-representation-management/research/2023-11-ARM-findarep-nav-usertest)) P5 talked about their struggle, and the struggle they observe older Veterans have, with finding information they need on VA websites.  The site navigation overwhelmed them, and they usually choose to use search over navigation.
   > I’ve been to the main stuff *mouses over side navigation on benefits.va.gov* and it’s a pain in the ass. When I go into here *clicks logo in header to go back to VA.gov homepage* it brings up too much stuff.” *scrolls down page, and back up* I’d have to read all of this _mouses over content on VA.gov homepage_ and figure out 'where does VSO live in this pot'. So it’s easier for me to just go into search and go directly to it, rather than wasting time pointing and clicking around. - P5, going between search results, benefits.va.gov, and va.gov to find information about a local VSO.
   
   > The navigation part seems to really be the issue. It’s not that the VA is failing and doesn’t do the things it needs to do.  It’s that people can’t seem to find what they need. It’s like I said earlier. Not every body points and clicks. Not everyone is tech savvy and knows what it is. We turned Google into a verb, go google this. There’s a lot of people believe it or not who don’t know what that is. It’s like google it - I don’t know what that is, so screw you. I’m going to go do my own things and still be frustrated.

### Authenicated menu
- In the **Dec 2023 Federal Header/Footer Phase 1** research ([folder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/header-footer/initiatives/2024-federal-standardized-header-footer/research/phase1-no-AT)), P8 talked about the auth menu. They stated:
  - My VA is ambiguous, and they weren't really sure what would be there. After more thought, they accurately described My VA as if they had been on the site, but still felt the navigation label was ambiguous.
  - When asked if they expected any other links to be in the menu, they listed: Claims, Benefits, and Education benefits. It wasn't clear if they expected links or other information related to these things directly in the menu
- In the MHV Secondary Navigation research ([folder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/overall-content-IA/2023-10-MHV-secondary-navigation-research)), P6 talked about expecting the main site menu to contain everything in the auth menu (to be combined into one) since they were logged into the site ([transcript](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/overall-content-IA/2023-10-MHV-secondary-navigation-research/Interview-transcripts/2023-11-22-P6.md)):
> No, none of this should be here. This [main] menu shouldn't have things about the VA. It should have stuff about me. My needs, my wants. That stuff should be in a different submenu. All this other stuff "contact us, find the VA location" this on another website should be under the two letters "VA" in the top level of the website. But this menu shouldn't be here in front of me once I'm logged in.
