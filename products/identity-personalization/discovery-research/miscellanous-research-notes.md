# Miscellaneous research notes

**Last update:** 11/17/2023

Many times, we hear feedback and observe behaviors about the authencticated experience in research studies that are meaningful, but not related to the main goals of the research study.  This means they're probably not captured in a findings report we can refer to later.

This is a doc to capture these things for now. Enjoy HQ will probably be a better place for this document once the whole team has access to it.

## Personalization

- In the **Nov 2023 Find a Rep user test** ([research folder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/accredited-representation-management/research/2023-11-ARM-findarep-nav-usertest)) P5 talked about conversations they have while helping older Veterans navigate VA online. The folks they help want to only see information about them. The participant laughed and doesn''t think its realistic, but stated that it would be wonderful for VA.gov to be personalized to them.

  > They say “well I want to know what my benefits are. So when I log on, I want it to say my benefits”. *Laughs* I tell them that’s not realistic. What they do, they try to make it easier for you to find what you need, and that is great. 

  > If we could have a magic world where your log in links to what you always do or what you commonly do, wouldn’t that be awesome? I only use it for prescriptions, for example. Well then my log in, when I login, should just be prescriptions and it doesn’t need all that other fluffy stuff.


## Signing into VA.gov

- In the **Nov 2023 Find a Rep user test** ([research folder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/accredited-representation-management/research/2023-11-ARM-findarep-nav-usertest)) P5 attempted to sign into the website immediately upon landing on it. The moderator didn't ask them to sign in, and stopped them, but this suggests signing in immediately upon arriving on the site is a regular pattern for this person.
  
## Navigating to personalized tasks
- In the **Nov 2023 Find a Rep user test** ([research folder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/accredited-representation-management/research/2023-11-ARM-findarep-nav-usertest)) P5 talked about their struggle, and struggle they observe older Veterans have, with finding information they need on VA.gov.  The site navigation overwhelmed them, and they usually choose to search if something isn't linked on the homepage.
