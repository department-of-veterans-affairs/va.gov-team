Auth Experience Comparative Analysis
============================================

May 2021

Background and goals
--------------------

Through the course of working on the Auth Experience team, we've identified an opportunity to expand our knowledge on best practices in personalized and authenticated experiences. We frequently solicit screenshots and log into our own accounts to compare and see what's out there, but typically don't have time for formal documentation.

The goal of this activity is to answer specific research questions and create a knowledge base of best practices to share with the authenticated experience team.

Research Questions
------------------

### Personalization

-   What is different about personalization of civic services compared to the private sector (banking, insurance)? 

-   Do sites use "My" or "Your" equally or is one more prevalent than another?

-   What information about users do sites commonly show in a logged-in state?

-   Where do the conventions we see align with what we're doing on VA.gov?

-   Where are they different?

### Profile

-   How do sites encourage profile completeness?
-   How do sites handle removing/deleting profile information? 
-   How do our nav/section labels align with other sites?
-   Are there any common sections of a user profile we don't have that could be useful to Veterans?

### Profile VS Dashboard

-   What information lives on a profile? 

-   What information lives on a dashboard?

### Dashboard

-   What information are people used to seeing on a dashboard?

-   What is a typical layout on a user dashboard?

-   How do sites handle removing/deleting information on a dashboard? 

-   What is the most important function of a dashboard? (this might be hard to see)

-   How do sites make a dashboard feel personalized?

### Action items

-   What action items are most typically shown?

-   What are the most important action items for users?

-   How are action items shown? Where are they located on a page?

-   Are action items sectioned out or are they in a "hub"?

-   How are action items prioritized?

-   How do users resolve these action items?

Method
------

We'll conduct a comparative analysis and divide the work by our respective design areas. Liz will focus on personalization and profile research questions. Tressa will focus on dashboard and action item research questions.

We'd like to focus primarily on sites in government, banking, student loans, and insurance industries since they serve as a good model for the VA.gov use cases.  We'll include a few sites outside of these sectors since we've heard Veteran's mention them repeatedly in research studies.  For this initial round of research, we'll limit the scope to desktop and mobile versions of sites (not apps).

#### Manage benefits, claims, view history

-   CareFirst Blue Cross Blue Shield

-   State Farm

-   USAA

-   Healthcare.gov

#### Payments, transactions, view history

-   Bank of America / Merrill Lynch

-   Fidelity Investments

-   Chase

-   Citicards

Federal Student Aid

#### Government

-   USA Jobs / Login.gov
-   Global Entry

#### Personalization, identity

-   Google
-   Reddit
-   Facebook
-   Instagram

We'll supplement our research with articles from reliable sources as needed.

### Timeline

-   Sprint 48: refine the plan we've started, start grabbing screenshots #24973

-   Sprint 49: wrap up screenshots, do any supplemental reading needed to answer questions, start synthesis #24974

-   Sprint 50: complete synthesis + present to team #24975
