## Background 🏗️
<details><summary>The Veteran experience is currently impacted by a static My VA page that does not prioritize or  surface the most relevant, time-sensitive actions, hindering timely engagement with benefits and  services. Furthermore, while updates are received via text and email, there is no centralized  notification experience on VA.gov for viewing, acting upon, and managing all communications.  This lack of a consolidated view can lead to missed key updates or time-sensitive actions,  without a way to review past communications. Our product aims to empower Veterans by  providing immediate attention to critical items and enabling direct action from the My VA page.

`Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)`

Authenticated Experience 
  
`What is Veterans’ familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?`

We are iterating on the current My VA page based on previous user feedback and analytics in  order to incorporate new features such as a centralized notification experience.

## Research Goals 🥅	
`What are you trying to learn from this research?` 

### Goals

`1.` **Validate if incorporating critical alert components and notifications center will guide Veterans  toward timely actions and create a more responsive, personalized homepage experience.**

`2.` **Validate if updating My VA to reflect recommendations from prior research and analytics  match Veteran mental models.**

  
### Outcome
`How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?`

---

Outcome will be a validated redesign for incorporating new components, new sections, and  notifications center into My VA. 

---

### Research questions

**`1.`Will updating My VA to align with changes suggested by prior research and analytics,  improve Veteran’s awareness of what needs to be done and how to take action?]**

**`2.`Are Veterans successfully able to navigate to their profile and to the new notifications page  from My VA? ]**

**`3.`Are there any sections that are confusing or missing from the profile that Veterans expect to  see?**


### Hypotheses
 
1. Based on prior research and analytics, we believe updating My VA and profile according to  previous recommendations will align with Veteran mental models. 

2. Based on prior research and analytics, we believe Veterans will want all of their notifications (note: notifications inform users about updates and reminders prompting engagement or action) in a centralized location on VA.gov. 

3. Based on previous research and analytics, we believe that the updated authenticated menu  navigation will meet Veterans expectations.  


---
  
## Methodology  🛠️
Usability testing: Evaluating if updates made based on analytics and past research  recommendations are aligned with Veteran's mental models and uncover usability barriers.

## Recruitment 🎯	
*OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers.*

> [!NOTE]
> Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources: 
> - [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/recruiting-participants) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research. 
> - [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.

### Recruitment approach
*Who is your intended audience for this research (e.g. Veterans, caregivers, VSOs, SMEs), and how will you recruit them?* 
- Perigean **CANNOT** recruit VA employees or VSOs. Work with your VA lead to recruit these groups. 
- Perigean can also support remote, [unmoderated studies](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/perigean-recruiting-process-for-unmoderated-studie), however, these studies require strict recruitment requirements. 
- Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Read this [introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md) and use the [recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity.

### Recruitment criteria

- **Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants.**
- Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question.
  Example: Have you been to a VA urgent care facility in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]

- The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria.
- Consider how you could leverage the [lean maximum variation sampling (MVS) approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md#lean-mvs-strategy) by breaking up criteria for your study into multiple cohorts that each isolate one primary criteria.
- Perigean will consider each cohort as a separate recruitment effort, increasing the chances of meeting all criteria for your study. [Review an example of the multiple cohort approach.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/pre-mhv-prototype/generative-research-study-1/2020-12.research-plan1.md)
