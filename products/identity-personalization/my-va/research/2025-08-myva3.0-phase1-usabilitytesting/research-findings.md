## Research Goals
The Veteran experience is currently impacted by a static My VA page that does not prioritize or surface the most relevant, time-sensitive actions, hindering timely engagement with benefits and services. Furthermore, while updates are received via text and email, there is no centralized notification experience on VA.gov for viewing, acting upon, and managing all communications. This lack of a consolidated view can lead to missed key updates or time-sensitive actions, without a way to review past communications. Our product aims to empower Veterans by providing immediate attention to critical items and enabling direct action from the My VA page.
The purpose of this research was to:
1. Empower Veterans by providing immediate attention to critical items and enabling direct action from the My VA page.
2. Validate a redesign for incorporating new components, new sections, and a notifications page into My VA.


## Research Questions
1. Will updating My VA to align with changes suggested by prior research and analytics, improve Veteran’s awareness of what needs to be done and how to take action? 
2. Are Veterans successfully able to navigate to their profile and to the new notifications page from My VA?
3. Are there any sections that are confusing or missing from the profile that Veterans expect to see?



## Methodology 

**Moderated interviews:** We conducted ten 45-minute remote moderated research sessions with Veterans who have a VA.gov or My HealtheVet account via Zoom from August 20, 2025, to August 28, 2025. The research sessions consisted of four tasks.

Note: Participant 2's data has been excluded from the research findings due to a lack of engagement during the session. 

Task 1: My VA section evaluation 

a. Participants asked to refill a prescription on My VA

b. Participants asked to review and share their thoughts for each section of My VA (Claims and appeals, Forms and applications, Healthcare, Payments and debts, Benefits) and naming of My VA

Task 2: Notification flyout and notifications page 

a. Participants asked to navigate to the notifications flyout from My VA

b. Participants asked to review and share their thoughts on the notifications flyout

c. Participants asked to navigate to notifications page 

d. Participants asked to review and share thoughts on central location for notifications, filter options, and naming of notifications page

Task 3: Navigating to Profile 

a. Participants asked to navigate to Profile from My VA 

b. Participants to review and share thoughts about current treatment of Profile to include the order of profile cards

Task 4: A/B testing 

a. Each participant viewed 3 versions of Profile and asked to select which one they preferred and their feedback

b. Each participant viewed 3 versions of the claims card and asked to select which one they preferred and their feedback

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

**1.Hypothesis Statement: Based on prior research and analytics, we believe updating My VA and profile according to previous recommendations will align with Veteran mental models.**
- **Likely True**
- The majority of participants expressed favorable feedback, finding most sections beneficial. Even when the content of a particular section did not directly apply to their current life stage, participants acknowledged its potential benefit for other Veterans.
Note: We observed that some participants indicated wanting My VA to be ordered in a way that is important to their individual situation with a preference for the Health care section to be presented first on My VA. All participants we interviewed had health care, but not all had other benefits.
“Well, personally, I think I would prefer to see appointments first, upcoming appointments and then meds and then everything else below because those are the things that I use most often”. - Participant 6
“I think I’d like to see the healthcare at the top”. - Participant 4. This feedback was categorized as a preference rather than a negative critique.

 
**2. Hypothesis Statement: Based on prior research and analytics, we believe Veterans will want all of their notifications (note: notifications inform users about updates and reminders prompting engagement or action) in a centralized location on VA.gov.**
- **Definitely True**
- 100% (9/9) of participants vocalized positive feedback when asked about their thoughts on a centralized location for notifications on VA.gov.  


**3. Hypothesis Statement: Based on previous research and analytics, we believe that the updated authenticated menu navigation will meet Veterans expectation.**
- **Likey True**
- Most participants gave neutral feedback when asked about the authenticated menu. When asked to navigate to the profile there was no major negative feedback on navigating to the menu from participants. 


## Key Findings

Task 1: My VA section evaluation - Users want enhanced information displayed and clearer messaging. 
Task 2: Notification flyout and notifications center page - Users confirmed their want for consistent notifications and centralized notifications on VA.gov. 
Task 3: Navigating to Profile - Users confirmed profile navigation as intuitive and aligned with industry standards.
Task 4: A/B testing - Users confirmed preference for optimized and user-friendly designs.  

# Details of Findings 

### Evidence Request Comprehension

#### 1. My VA section evaluation
- Users want enhanced information displayed and clearer messaging.
- Participants asked to refill a prescription on My VA.
5 of 5 participants completed this task. Note: For tasks we were only able to capture completion from 5 participants, as the other 5 were unable to share their screens during the session.
Prescription refill findings -  User feedback was split. Users either appreciated the "slick" and "faster than expected" Rx refill process, or expected a more comprehensive experience. 

**Positive Feedback**

   -  Supporting data: [Moderator - On a scale to 1 to 5, where 1 is very unlikely and five is very likely, how likely would you use the refill prescription feature on this page?] “5, absolutely… That was so awesome. That was so slick. Now, I think truthfully, me, 'cause I love tech stuff and I love smoothness like that, I think that's awesome, right?  I think a lot of other vets especially because, well, it's called [name], a lot of us veterans are still on the older side, not the the like 30s through 20s side yet, although it's coming. But I think they might get a little confused… But I think I think this is awesome because it makes it so much faster…. It makes it so much easier.” - Participant 5 

   -  Supporting data: [Moderator - So what are your thoughts on this instead of the confirmation page?] “I guess it's fine. I, I, I saw that there were two refills left and there's only one. There's a confirmation that says refill, refill request sent. So I think it's OK.”  [Moderator - On a scale of one to five where 1 is very unlikely and five is very is very likely, how likely would you, excuse me, use the refill prescription feature on this page?] “I would use it 5 very likely.” - Participant 4 

   - Supporting data: Well, let's click on the refill prescription. Does this meet your expectations? “Refill's left one fill date. Yes it does” - Participant 10 

   - Supporting data: *Participant 6 had concerns about the amount of medications.  Participant 6 - [Moderator - What are your thoughts on this experience on the medications?]
It shows one medication, but I have more than that. So is it supposed to be showing more than that? … [Moderator - But if you were to refill that one, would the clicking on the button, would you expect it to show this once you clicked on? ] OK, Yeah, I would expect it to show medications and their statuses. So this one says that a refill request has been sent. So I know I don't have to do anything. It's already in process. [Moderator - On a scale of one to five where 1 is very unlikely and five is very likely, how likely would you use the refill prescription feature on this page?] Yeah, I mean, yeah, five. - Participant 6 


**Negative feedback** 

   - Supporting data: “That just says a refill request was sent, but I have no idea whether it was sent to pick up in the pharmacy or to be mailed to me” …”give the veteran the change to order it by pick up and say where they want to pick it up because I might want to refill it.” - Participant 11 

   - Supporting data:  - [Moderator - OK, so if you were to click on that yellow alert to refill a prescription, what would you expect to see next?] Oh, I, I, I would, I don't like that. [OK, what about it do you not like?] I, I don't know. I feel like in mind there's one more level of sensor check that verifies before I do it. If I accidentally, because when I'm scrolling on my MacBook, I'm using a trackpad and I accidentally click things, I could accidentally refill things that I don't mean to refill, but there was something else there. - Participant 3

   - Supporting data: [Moderator - OK, so on a scale of one to five where 1 is very unlikely and five is very likely, how likely would you use the refill prescription feature on this page?] I don't think I will do them on this page. - Participant 13


**Participants asked to review and share their thoughts for each section of My VA (Claims and appeals, Forms and applications, Healthcare, Payments and debts, Benefits) and naming of My VA.**

**Claims and appeals feedback:** Users validated the relocation of the disability rating from the header to the claims and appeals section of My VA. 

   - Supporting data:[ Moderator - How do you feel about the disability rating being under the claims and appeals section?] I think it's fine because it's part of what you're. It's part of what you're. You're if let's say, let's say you need to upgrade or you're looking to upgrade or whatever or make an appeal, right? Knowing what your rating is right there next to that section, I think is a great call. Otherwise the other other best place to have it would probably be in benefits. - Participant 5 

   - Supporting data:  [Moderator - What are your thoughts on the disability rating being under claims and appeals]? I don't mind that as long as I can see make sure you guys haven't changed what my rating is. - Participant 11
Forms and applications feedback: Users had an overall neutral response to the Forms and applications section of My VA.

   - Supporting data: [Moderator - “How do you feel about being able to see your previously completed forms in this section?”]  “Oh, it's OK. I, I guess I'd, I'd like to like to be able to see a comparison for what's in progress and what's completed. And it's just kind of like a, a friendly reminder that something was already completed” - Participant 4 

**Health care feedback:** There's a strong preference for explicit and unambiguous terminology (e.g., "Secure messaging" over "messaging,").

   - Supporting data: [Moderator - What are your thoughts about the Healthcare section] “If messages said secure messaging, I'd know a little bit more as to what that is.” - Participant 3 
Appointment card:  Users feel current information on VA.gov is often limited. They want more comprehensive details consistently displayed, especially on appointment cards (building/clinic info). They also appreciate "at first glance" information for better segmentation.

   - Supporting data:  “sometimes they just tell you like you have an appointment that they don't tell you like don't remind me like which, which clinic or stuff like that to go to… Then you have to like call the numbers and find out to as a reminder” - Participant 12

   - Supporting data: “It would be nice to have a room number… and possible if there’s my care provider’s name” - Participant 6 

   - Supporting data: “But like I said, those medical centers, sometimes they’re hard to navigate if you don't know where you're going.. The room number would be helpful” - Participant 13

**Yellow alert in cards:** Users appreciated the yellow critical alerts in the cards which stated the action needed and deadline date.
[During A/B testing Participant 3 was asked about their preference.] “....like option A better that immediately tells me what I need to do in the yellow [alert].” - Participant 3

**Payments and Debts:** No actionable feedback. 

**Benefits:**  Users validated incorporating the new benefits section to include dependents, Post 9/11 BI BIll, and Learn more sections.  

   - Supporting data: [Moderator - On a scale of one to five where 1 is very unlikely and five is very likely, how likely would you use this benefit section?] Five very likely. - Participant 4 

   - Supporting data: [Moderator - OK, so based off the benefits section, on a scale of one to five, where 1 is very unlikely and five is very likely, how likely would you use the benefits Section?] 4, four. [OK, can you tell me why 4?] Because there's always room for improvement. You know, if I say 5, I don't use it that much, but I likely use it to go back and check on stuff. - Participant 12

Supporting data: [Moderator - If you were to click on the See all available VA benefits link, where do you expect to go or what do you expect to be shown?] I really don't know or what would you like to see? Well, I guess a list of what's available to me. - Participant 6 

   - Supporting data: [Moderator - So the link in the what to learn more, want to learn more about the VA benefits the last one. What do you where do you expect that link to take you?] My guess, my guess because we're logged in.So it might. Take me to a page that shows me everything I could qualify for or just maybe some general information knowing, knowing VA stuff, it'd probably be general information that then you could maybe click on links to take you to stuff that you can look into more. So let's say for example, it would take me to like a info page talking about the the VA home loan, right? Or an info page about, I don't know what other, some other VA benefit out there. Right. And then you can click on that to see what you qualify. - Participant 5 

**Naming of My VA:** Users stated that adding "Dashboard" to "My VA" would improve clarity. Participants generally favored "My VA Dashboard," though some indicated "My Dashboard" would be acceptable if character limits were an issue. For instance, Participant 13 preferred "My VA Dashboard" but understood the need for "My Dashboard" due to sizing constraints. 

   - Supporting data: [Moderator -  “What are your, what are your thoughts on My VA dashboard?”] “ Would it need to be my?Then it could just be VA dashboard, VA dashboard kerning and all that. OK, so dashboard is more. Oh, yeah, that's very descriptive.I don't know if any of you served, but we tend to use extremely descriptive words for the stuff that we, we, the equipment that we use.” - Participant 3 

   - Supporting data: [Moderator - “Currently this page is named My VA, but we have been thinking about possibly renaming it to My VA Dashboard or VA Dashboard, Do you have any thoughts around that?.] ”I think my you want it there. So the person says this is the stuff that applies to me, my VA dashboard. I like dashboard or a word that tells you, oh, this is like my command central, you know? So I do like the mine because it's like OK, this is my stuff. This is not general stuff.” - Participant - 13 

#### 2. Notifications flyout and notifications page 
-Users confirmed their want for consistent notifications and centralized notificaion on VA.gov 

-Participants asked to navigate to the notifications flyout from My VA feedback:

3 of 5 participants completed this task. Note: For tasks we were only able to capture completion from 5 participants, as the other 5 were unable to share their screens during the session.
Users found the notification navigation intuitive, aligning with industry standards. 

   - Supporting data: The notifications up there has a little red dot by the bell. Do I get to click on that?  Oh, that's for later….. I also really like the notifications bell because that's a oh, crap, is there something I forgot? - Participant 3

   - Supporting data:  “So to me that that seems like notification. I see a bell and I see the red dot just because in the world of apps or accounts, usually notification looks like that.” - Participant 12 

   - Supporting data: [Moderator - OK, so from this page, can you tell me where you navigate to to view important updates from the VA or updates?] I'd go to notifications. That little bell with the red dot, that probably means I have a notification. - Participant 10
Participants asked to review and share their thoughts on the notifications flyout: Users praised the clean structure and details in the notifications flyout. Users expect the notifications to be displayed in chronological order and expect to receive notifications about various health care topics and upcoming appointments. 

   - Supporting data: [Moderator - Speaking on healthcare, is there any other healthcare notifications you think should be included in this drawer or any other notifications in general?] I think reminders. Speaking as a [occupation] now, reminders of lab tests and X-rays or any other special tests, I think under medical appointments, which I think you do now, but I'm not sure. Reminders of appointments you've done to my what? … My community health vaccinations, would that also would well, there's vaccinations in there, yes, but I'm thinking alike. - participant 11

   - Supporting data: I would like to see sorted by date the appointments that I have coming up applicable so that I can then see who the appointment is with time and location. … [Moderator - Would you possibly also want updates about medical records, vaccinations of that sort?] Yeah, that'd be good. Yeah. Test results, you know, if you do labs you need. … Vaccinations is really good, too, now that you mention it. - Participant 6

   - Supporting data: [Moderator - Is there any information that you would like to see possibly included in the drawer?] No, but I didn't notice. Are these in chronological order 'cause I would like the most recent one at the top? Yeah, they are in chronological order it looks like. - participant 10

   - Supporting data:  I think the newest [notification] should be listed should be the first. [Moderator - “OK, So in chronological order?”] OK, yes, yes. Participant - 12
Participants asked to review and share thoughts on central location of notifications, filter options, and naming of notifications page feedback: 


**Notifications naming** - Users preferred the title ‘Notifications’ over an ‘Activity feed’ as it matched Veterans mental models better. 
 
   - Supporting data: [Moderator - asked about naming “Notifications” over “Activity feed”. ]  ‘It’s it’s, it’s more, it’s more to me. It’s clear, you know, its clear you, you’re getting notified about different things. We are notifying you this” - Participant 12 
 
   - Supporting data:  [Moderator - asked about naming “Notifications” over activity feed”.] “Activity feed is a no, no… because it’s things that you’re being notified about, whereas Activity feed, I don't know it, this Activity feed is a little more innocuous and notifications is more to the point” - Participant 6
 
   - Supporting data:  [Moderator - “OK, well, we're actually thinking about naming it Activity Feed. Do you have any opinions on that versus notifications?”] I like notifications. I think 'cause that's a term I think I see used in other software. So when I see notifications, I pretty much know what to expect. -  Participant 10


**Central location for notifications on VA.gov** - Users appreciate the new notifications feature, they especially like having a repository of past notifications available for review. 

   - Supporting data: [Moderator - how do you feel about a central location for notification on VA.gov?] “​​I think it's it's good to see. I have to like, I have to expect these notifications to, to just go away. Like, like on my phone, you know, there's a notification and you clear it and then it's gone. So I'm actually glad that notifications are saved because you'll have a way to know like when you were notified in case you forget you, like, you might wonder like, well, when when did I find out about this or when was I supposed to have known?” - Participant 4

   - Supporting data: [Moderator - “How do you feel about a central location for various types of notifications from the VA?]  “Oh, such as this? Yes, love it.” - Participant 3

   - Supporting data: [Moderator - “So how do you feel about a central location for various types of notifications from the VA.” ] “I Think it's a great idea, to be honest with you. It's less, it's less menu navigating, less what I call menu hell, right?” - Participant 6


**Notification filter** - Users expressed appreciation for the filter options and indicated a desire for the ability to filter notifications by date. 2 participants mentioned possibly adding sub categories for the Health care filter selection, however participant 10 changed their thoughts after thinking about the complexity of multiple sub categories.

   - Supporting data: [Moderator - “What are your thoughts on the available options in the filter?”] It looks good. It's it's fine to see. So if you want to come over here and you only want to see something specific, it'll be really easy to do. ... yeah, maybe a date range and it would be nice to be able to enter a date range.” - Participant 4 

   - Supporting data: “ My feedback is that I really, really like the filter. Some people may have a lot of notifications to sort through, some may not.”  - Participant 13 

   - Supporting data:Like I kind of at first was thinking under healthcare, you could have like appointments, prescriptions and different things. But I think just having Healthcare is good because if you broke down each of the six different categories into a bunch of subcategories, it might be confusing to some people. So I like, I like having it just once you have that, they're sufficient 'cause you could just click on one and see if there are like different subcategories in it or just start scrolling through and reading it. So I, I like it the way it is, I think.” - Participant 10

#### 3. Navigating to Profile 
- Users confirmed Profile navigation as intuitive and aligned with industry standards.

**Participants asked to navigate to Profile from My VA:** 4 of 5 participants completed this task. Note: For tasks we were only able to capture completion from 5 participants, as the other 5 were unable to share their screens during the session. 

Users found the Profile navigation intuitive, aligning with industry standards. 

   - Supporting data: [Moderator - “Before you navigate to Profile, do you have any thoughts on the menu options?”] “No, because a lot of other websites, I don't know why my brain went here first. A lot of other websites has your name or your username, whatever it is listed up there with a with a drop down menu and then you click on that to get to profile settings or whatever. So like that's I think that's that's great because it's it's what you expect from all the other other work websites too. “ - Participant 5

**Participants to review and share thoughts about current treatment of Profile to include the order of profile cards:**  Users overall had a neutral feedback around the current card treatment and content of Profile. 

   - Supporting data: [Moderator - “So I'm going to give you a moment to look at the page, review the page and let me know your thoughts.”]
“I think that all looks OK.” [Moderator - “Do you have any thoughts about the order of the cards on the page?”] “No, and again, you know, I think all this information obviously is available.” - Participant 9 


   - Supporting data:[Moderator - “Take a moment to review the page and can you let me know if there's anything missing that you would like to see or anything confusing?] “Oh, my contact information. For a moment I thought that was contact information for the hospitals and stuff. No, I think this is good.” - Participant 3 
I think service history should be first. [Moderator - OK, And can you tell me why?] Because it is the VA that's like the most important piece of information as far as your personal profile to me anyway, like your name and everything that's very important, your name and your contacts. - Participant 10

#### 3. A/B testing 

-Users confirmed preference for optimized and user-friendly designs.
Users prefer clean interfaces with clear claim card designs (Option B) and detailed profile options (Option A). 

**Profile option A** - Users preferred the detailed descriptions in profile options (Option A for profiles).
  
   - Supporting data: [Moderator - Can you let us know why option A”] “Option a give you it, it tell you OK personally, if everybody explain to you what you need to put there, you know, and and like I said, we make to make things simple so people understand what they're doing that kind of information, what we need.” - Participant 12 
   - Supporting data: “Definitely not B Option A is better than B because it explains what it is.” - Participant 3 

**Claim card Option B** - Users valued the clear steps outlined in Option B claim card designs. 
Users feel current information on VA.gov is often limited. They want more comprehensive details consistently displayed, especially on claim cards (what's missing, next steps).

   - Supporting data:  “Yeah, I like B just because it's I like the the IT tells you what step of the process you're on, which says you're on Step 3 and it tells you that we sent you a letter. And I like the having the submit the evidence up at the, you know, in highlighted in yellow up at the top.” - Participant 10 


**Areas of Opportunity:**

## Additional Insights
**Feedback about MyHealtheVET**

Users express confusion about the coexistence of My VA and My HealthVet platforms. 
“I thought that would be gone because they said My VA, that org was replacing MyHealtheVet, but it’s kinda of confusing because sometimes to get the certain thing you got to go to MyHealtheVet” - Participant 12


**Appointments painpoints** 

Participants express that sometimes not all of the appointments are available for review by Veterans. Possible system error, will pass feedback along to the appropriate team. 


**Feedback about the size of the font of My VA especially on Mobile web experience**  

Participants expressed that the size of the H2 font on My VA was very big and confused them when understanding what page they are reviewing. 
“I right off the bat, I feel like when I see this, I feel like I'm not on my VA page, but I'm on the claims and appeal page because everything is so great. I'm expecting to see something like this when I'm already in that section because now I'm scrolling and oh, I'm in health, you know, and again, it's very big”. - Participant 13 


## Recommendations

*Summarize actionable recommendations based on findings.*  

1. **Recommendation:** Complete copy updates   
   - Supporting evidence: Rename My VA to My VA Dashboard or My Dashboard. This change will require collaboration with multiple teams and stakeholders. It may be implemented as a fast-following initiative post-launch to avoid impeding the release of new features to users. 
   - Supporting evidence: Rename "Messages" to "Secure messages" to clarify the card's purpose for users.
   - Supporting evidence: Proceed with "Notifications" over "Activity Feed" as the title of the new Notifications feature, as it aligns more closely with the Veterans' mental model.
   - Supporting evidence: Update GI Bill card title to align with benefit informational page. Change Post-9/11 GI Bill debt for tuition to Post-9/11 GI Bill benefit. https://www.va.gov/education/check-remaining-post-9-11-gi-bill-benefits/
  
2. **Recommendation:** Update the cards on My VA to match user expectations  
   - Supporting evidence: Include comprehensive details on the health appointment card, such as the room number, physician's name, and any significant location information. This will substantially enhance user experience before their medical appointments.		 
   - Supporting evidence: Move forward with more research for the one click feature to refill prescriptions on My VA. Reach out to the team over current prescriptions experience to gain insights. 
   - Supporting evidence: Move forward with new Benefits sections and cards (Dependents, Post 9-11/GI Bill, Learn more card/See all benefits link) on My VA.
  
3. **Recommendation:** Notifications features   
   - Supporting evidence: Move forward with notifications dropdown, notifications page, and filter component. 
   - Supporting evidence: Move forward with an extended notification history on the notification page for reference purposes as Veterans expect to be able to view all of the notifications received over time.
   - Supporting evidence: Update the notification drawer to align with the current menu's dropdown behavior.
   - Supporting evidence: Update the notification filter to incorporate a date picker, facilitating the ease of filtering notifications by date.
   - Supporting evidence: Incorporate various types of notifications in the notification dropdown. 


4. **Recommendation:** A/B testing selections   
   - Supporting evidence: Move forward with Option B of claims card
   - Supporting evidence: Move forward with Option A of Profile

## Product User and Business Outcomes

Our research findings consistently highlight user theme needs for clarity, comprehensive information, intuitive navigation, and consistent communication across My VA, notifications, and Profile sections. Addressing these identified areas through the recommended enhancements will directly improve the overall user experience, leading to increased satisfaction with VA.gov and directly supporting the goal of a 5-point improvement.

### Desired User Outcome 
This research supports our desired user outcome by....
*Veterans are able to see what needs their attention right away (e.g., unread messages, pending document uploads, important deadlines, upcoming appointments).
*Veterans can take quick action on priority items navigating quickly to the relevant onsite experience.
*Veterans can navigate to centralized hubs when actions are not required, such as claims tracker, recent payments, etc.

 
### Desired Business Outcome
This research supports our desired business outcome by....
*Increase in completion rates for key workflows (e.g., uploading documents, attending appointments).
*Reduction in call center volume due to improved self-service.
*Improved Veteran trust and satisfaction with VA.gov as a digital platform.



## Key Performance Indicators

FY25 OCTO DE Goal 1: O1: VA’s digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.
1.1 Improve satisfaction with our web and mobile products by 5 points.


## Next Steps

*Share findings and recommendations with the team. 
*Update designs based on user feedback and being the experimental research collaboration cycle with focus on the notifications dropdown and page. 
*Reach out to the MHV medications team over the prescription refill experience.
*Reach out to MHV appointments team over improvements to the appointments cards. 



## Further research needed

Further usability testing with a specific focus on accessibility for the notification drawer and the new notifications page. This testing is important to ensure the design decisions adheres to the standards of the experimental design collaboration cycle and effectively addresses the diverse needs of all Veterans.
