# Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is **Ashley** and **[NOTETAKER NAME]** will be joining us to take notes. Today we're going to talk about some possible new updates to My VA and profile. 

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to confirm with you: 

**Screener Confirmations++ 

Confirming you are on [device]? 
If no: If possible, can you join from your [device] please? I can help you re-join, or we can continue if you’re more comfortable on the device you’re on now. 

Do you currently have a VA.gov account?  

“I have written down that you currently have “XYZ benefits”. Is that correct? 
If no: Can you list the benefits you currently have? 


I'll now go over a few details about today's session... 

 
**This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic. 

**In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express. 

**Your participation is completely voluntary.** If for any reason you want to stop, or do not want to answer a question, please let me know. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know. You'll be compensated no matter how much of the session we complete today. 

**I want to be transparent that my co-workers and I are here in a research capacity only.** We want to hear about your experiences, good or bad, in case there are processes we can improve upon in the future, but we cannot directly impact your benefits in any way. 


Knowing this, I have [#] teammates who would like to observe our session but are optional. Would that be okay, or do you prefer to keep the session to just the three of us? 

If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom. 

If yes: Admit observers. 

Then, ask the observer(s) to give a brief, camera-on introduction, first name and position with VA.gov. 

Once complete, ask the notetaker and observer(s) to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth. 

 

Are you ok if I record my screen and audio for analysis and reporting purposes? We like to record to confirm that we’ve captured your opinions accurately and sometimes share video or audio clips with our colleagues at the VA. Nothing is ever shared outside of the VA. If we do share video or audio we don’t share anything that identifies you, such as your name or face. 

If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more. 

**➡️ Start recording.** 

I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?  
Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you? 
# Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions. 

1. What is the main reason you log into your VA.gov account?  
Do you know what My VA is? Do you use My VA? 
If yes: Are there any tasks that are not currently on My VA that you think you should be able to accomplish on My VA?  

2. Do you currently receive any email or text notifications from the VA? 
How do you currently receive notifications from the VA? 
Are there any email or text notifications that you think the VA should be sending that the VA currently does not send?  

3. Have you ever used or viewed your profile on VA.gov?  
If yes: How often are you using or viewing your profile?  
What do you use your profile for?
