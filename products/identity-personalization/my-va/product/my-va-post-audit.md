# Next steps for My VA after the audit updates

The goal of the [My VA audit updates](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2022-audit#readme) are to bring greater consistency to the page, and overall simplify the number of states for a better user experience and easier management. 

We're also adding a few education links, which means that after these updates launch, My VA will largely cater to the top interactions on VA.gov, and we may not need to add a lot more to the page besides "records" links (which we see in analytics and have heard in research is expected functionality).

So, where does that leave us post-March/April 2023?

1. **Continued development on on-site notifications**: Scaling on-site notifications functionality will be on-going work. At this point, it's possible we'd be ready to start exploring the idea of a notification center, or potentially developing one if research bears this out as necessary functionality.
2. **Adding records info to My VA**: While this would likely be a small project, adding records links would likely be a worthwhile addition to My VA.
3. **My VA research**: Like most digital tools, My VA is never going to be "done". However, we want development to be purposeful, and we don't want to be adding or moving things around that don't need to be added or moved. This would be a good time to do some generative research on My VA that may answer some of the following questions:
  - How do people navigate their VA.gov / overall VA experience? How does My VA fit into that, if at all?
  - What is My VA missing? Anything?
  - How could My VA be improved? Is it navigable when all sections show all the time? 
  - How does My VA fit into a broader authenticated experience?
  - How does My VA meet the needs of first-time users? How could we better cater to people who are new to VA and don't know how to get started?
4. **General auth experience research**: While we haven't had the time or people to do it, our team can and should be thinking about the broader authenticated experience and how people move around VA.gov. If Mikki is available, we could research that covers the following:
  - How do people navigate VA.gov when logged in?
  - How does the current navigation and structure of the site meet their expectations? Where is it lacking? How can it be improved?
