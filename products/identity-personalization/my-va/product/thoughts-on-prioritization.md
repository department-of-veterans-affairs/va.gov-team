# Thoughts on prioritization

Let's use this doc to start defining how we think about priority on VA.gov and My VA.

## Prioritization across VA.gov

|Priority level| Information type|
|--------------|-----------------|
|High priority| <ul><li>Anything that requires action</li><li>Anything that is time sensitive</li><li>Broad changes to veteran benefits or health care (eg. PACT Act)</li></ul>|
|Medium priority|<ul><li>Personalized status updates </li><li>System errors/alerts</li></ul>|
|Lesser priority|<ul><li>General, non-personalized info</li></ul>|

## Prioritization specific to My VA content

This is partially based on analyics/user research, partially Samara's opinion. Let's discuss this.

|Priority level| Information type|
|--------------|-----------------|
|High priority| <ul><li>Claim updates* </li><li>Appointments</li><li>New secure messages</li><li>Outstanding copays</li><li>Outstanding debts</li></ul>|
|Medium priority|<ul><li>New payments</li><li>In-progress benefit applications/alerts</li></ul>|
|Lesser priority|<ul><li>General links</li></ul>|

*Claim updates may not necessarily require action, but since analytics show this is the top tool on VA.gov, and user research has corroborated this, claim status will always be high priority.

## How can we communicate priority

I realize Angela is probably all over this, but we haven't discussed these things and how we are employing them on My VA at a high level.
