## Screen reader walk-through with Angela Fowler - My VA
 
Notes from the My VA portion of a screen reader walk-through with Angela. Angela's suggestions in **bold**.

- Noted that My VA uses H1, which is ideal. 

- Because it was a new page to her, Angela arrowed down the page.

- Noted that Claims and appeals is H2, which is ideal.

- Noted that everything is organized so things like Healthcare claims appeals are H2 and “what to do popular actions” are H3s, which is ideal.

- **I would put an H3 above "Your total VA debt…" (currently small paragraph text) that says something like “Your Total Debt.”**

- **Explore VA benefits and health care should probably be H2.**

- Education and Training is a little confusing, maybe because of the **Explore VA benefits and health care should be H2. Then health care, disability, education/training should all be H3 (not H4).**

- Samara had a question about the name tag: Also on this page, when does it make sense to read that out? It didn't ruin your experience that you didn’t see it, but disability rating is important - and we thought it was the easiest place to find it.

  - Angela: It’s not marked with a heading. **It should really be below H1 and depending on how important it is, it should be marked with an H2.**
  
  - Do we really need it on every single page? **I would put it on the page that you land on when you sign in. Would put it on the main page of My VA, My Health, and Profile.**

  - Samara: For My VA, might make sense to read out MyVA then name tag information before the rest of the page.

  - Angela: **Overall the name tag needs to be consistently in the same place and marked the same way.**
