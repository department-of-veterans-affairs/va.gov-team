# My VA Benefit Applications and Forms Use Cases: User has submitted a benefit application and/or form(s)

**Last updated:** November 11, 2024

For LOA3 users who sign in and have a [**supported** benefit application or form saved (or multiple](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/forms-status-on-My-VA#the-mvp-will-target-the-following-forms)), we will show a card (or cards) for:
- their application(s) in the Benefit applications and forms section on My VA that provides a link for them to continue their application
- Note that benefit application or forms drafts will be visible as well

## UX
- Any logged in LOA1 or LOA3 user can see the Benefit applications and forms section on My VA.
- When a user has submitted a [supported application or form](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/forms-status-on-My-VA#the-mvp-will-target-the-following-forms), they will see a card in this section that tells them:
  - Current step in the submission process (submission in progress, received, or action needed)
  - Form name
  - Form code
  - Submitted on date
  - Last updated date
  - (If action needed ONLY: an error alert)
- This card is always displayed on the left hand side of the page on desktop (a single column)
- If a user has multiple benefit application, forms, or drafts saved, they will see a card for each of them in this section and they are stacked vertically for both desktop and mobile
  - Uses the [card component](https://design.va.gov/components/card) from the VA design system.

- A user will also see at the bottom of the section an accordion component that is titled "If you can't find your application or form", with explanation as to why a user may not see their form appear in this section.
