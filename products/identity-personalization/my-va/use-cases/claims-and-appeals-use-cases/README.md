# My VA: Claims and Appeals Use Cases

**Last updated:** August 1, 2023

- This feature on My VA gives the user a status update on any open or recently closed claims (within the last 60 days) and links them to the claims tool to see more details. 
- This feature also contains a link to the claims tool to manage all claims and appeals and a link for them to learn more about filing claims.
- For all use cases, the user must be LOA3 (identity verified). All LOA3 users will see this section on My VA.
- [LOA1 users](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/use-cases/LOA1-use-cases) will not see this section on My VA.
