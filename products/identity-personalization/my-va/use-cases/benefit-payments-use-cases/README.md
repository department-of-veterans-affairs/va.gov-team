# My VA: Benefit Payments Use Cases

**Last updated:** December 14, 2022

## Overview of Benefit Payments

* Benefit payments occur when a Veteran has already applied and been approved for VA benefits. These are paid out monthly via direct deposit or paper check.
* This feature on My VA gives the Veteran a summary of their most recent benefit payment and a link to past payments, if there are any to show.
* For all of these use cases, the user must be LOA3 (identity verified).
* [LOA1 users](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/use-cases/LOA1-use-cases) will not see this section on My VA.
