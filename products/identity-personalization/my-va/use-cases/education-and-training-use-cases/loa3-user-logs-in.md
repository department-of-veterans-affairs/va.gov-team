# My VA Education and Training Use Case: LOA3 user logs in

**Last updated:** February 15, 2024 - added Figma links

For LOA3 users who sign in from the home page, they will see an Education and training section on My VA with three useful education links.

## UX
- Any logged in LOA3 user can see the Education and training section on My VA.
- All logged in LOA3 users will see links in this section for [“Learn how to apply for VA education benefits”](https://va.gov/education/how-to-apply/), [“Compare GI Bill benefits by school”](https://va.gov/education/gi-bill-comparison-tool), and [“Check your Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits”](https://va.gov/education/gi-bill/post-9-11/ch-33-benefit/). These all link to pages on VA.gov.
