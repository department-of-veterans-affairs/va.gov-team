# My VA Redirect Initiative Brief
---

## Outcome Summary
Evaluate how My VA performs as a personalized logged in homepage via redirect. This is not an initiative to replace the existing logged in homepage. Veterans would be redirected to My VA upon logging in from the VA.gov homepage in order to provide them a more immediate personalized experience.

## Problem
Our mission is to elevate Veterans’ personal and benefit information on VA.gov so that they can more easily understand their statuses, complete necessary tasks and take action where needed. The current logged in homepage on VA.gov lacks elements of personalization that enable Veterans to access the information they need and perform tasks as effectively and efficiently as possible.

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

#### [Next clicks from My VA](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/report/content-pages/a50123418w177519031p184624291/_r.tabId=navigationsummary&_r.drilldown=analytics.pagePath:~2Fmy-va~2Findex.html&navigationsummary-keySelector.searchTerm=~2Fmy-va~2F/)

**Hypothesis**: Clicks from My VA to the homepage will increase if people can not find a link on My VA that they can find on the homepage.

**KPI**: We see less than a 10% increase or no increase in clicks back to the homepage from My VA.

## Discovery
### Assumptions/Risks


| Risk Category | Risk | How will we validate/test/prep against this risk? | Comments |
|--------|--------|---------|---------|
| Value Risk (will people use it) | Will we be able to tell tell if people are using it/like the redirect? | Ensure Medallia is in place, functioning properly to capture feedback | |
| Usability Risks (can people figure out how to use it)| What will the nature of redirect be? How to do it in the least jarring way, and track that experience appropriately? |    |
|(Technical) Feasibility Risks (can we build it with available tech/data)| Can My VA handle traffic is the personalized logged in homepage? |  | |
|(Technical) Feasibility Risks (can we build it with available tech/data)| What is the nature of the redirect? |  | |
| Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints (will there be a positive organizational impact?)| Who do we need to get support/champions for us, who is going to be opposed? |   | |


### Solution Summary
For Veterans who login from the homepage, implement a redirect to send them to My VA instead of landing on the logged in homepage post login. Begin a phased launch of this redirect to 25% of Veterans for ~1 week and evaluate analytics. If we can not meaningfully glean insights from 1 week's worth of analytics, we'll monitor for an additional week. Based on inital phased rollout make adjustments to My VA as needed and then continue phased launch to 50% of users, similarly for approximately 1 week. Again, monitor and make adjustments as needed, and continue phased launch to 100% of users. Once we have achieved 100% rollout, monitor analytics closely for 1 month to evaluate performance. It is important to reiterate that this initiative is not a replacement of the existing logged in homepage.
