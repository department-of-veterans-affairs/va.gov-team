# Conversation Guide for My VA Redirect UAT
- [ ] Make sure dev team has turned on feature for user
- [ ] Post in #feedback-backchannel

## Intro - 2 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is Liz and I also have a notetaker here. We've added a new feature to improve Veterans access to relevant updates and we want to test to make sure it’s working properly in your account.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:
* There are some additional members from the website team who would like to observe the session and hear your feedback live. Are you comfortable with them joining the session? No pressure either way.
	* *Let other observers into room and allow a short pause to say hello.* Ok, so here we have some other members from our website team - hi everyone. And for those of you who just joined, if you could please turn off your cameras to save bandwidth, the would be great.
* **This entire session should take about 30 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
* **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** If you find something we show you to be confusing, we want to hear about it. Your feedback helps us to figure out how we can improve the Veteran experience, and we will not be offended by any opinions you express.
* **We will be able to see your real information today.** This may include some healthcare information and some claims information. During any of the tasks if you feel uncomfortable sharing your screen with any of your information on it, feel free to stop screensharing and start again when you feel comfortable.
* **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**

* **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** I will stop the recording once you are logged into the site so we don't record your personal information. We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
	* If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

*Start recording.*

* **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 2 minutes
**Task goal: Confirm they qualify for the study

1. As part of the scheduling for this session, we asked if you have an account on VA.gov. Can you confirm for me the email address you use with your DS Logon, MyHealtheVet, Login.gov or ID.me account?
	* If they do not know what that means, ask: Do you ever sign into any va websites, such as VA.gov or ebenefits, to access or apply for your benefits? (If yes: Can you talk me through how you do that?)

2. Do you know your username and password so you can log in for the session today?
	* If not: Are these readily accessible? Could get them?
	* If the user can not remember or retrieve their login credentials, **end the session.**
	
3. Today we are going to observe you interacting with the new feature on your computer, and I’ll have you log in shortly.  Before we do that, I’d like to hear about a recent time you logged into VA.gov.  Can you tell me what prompted you to log in?

4. What else do you log into VA.gov to do?

5. Thanks for sharing that! It’ll be helpful to know that as we move forward. Would you feel comfortable sharing your screen with me at this time?
	* If no: Explain this is necessary for testing. If they are still unwilling, **end the call.**

OK, please share your screen, and then we will get started.

## 1. Confirm redirect takes user to My VA from home page- 5 minutes
I'd like you to open a new tab in your browser, and go to https://www.va.gov/ and sign in.

*Pause recording during sign in*
*Participant should be redirected to My VA after signing in. If they are not, ask:*
- Do you have any other email addresses you use to sign in? Let’s go ahead and try that.

*If they’re still unsuccessful*
- Go ahead and click on My VA

### UAT tasks
- [ ] Confirm that they are LOA3. If they are not, they'll see a "Verify your identity" prompt. If they are not LOA3, **end the session**.
- [ ] Confirm user was properly redirected to My VA
- [ ] Note the device and browser

## 2. Understand expectation and next steps - 5 minutes
*Make sure you have resumed recording!*

### If redirect was not successful
- ask user to click on My VA
- go to task 3**

### If redirect was successful

Great! Tell me about where you’ve landed on the website.

**For magnification users, if needed to evaluate two-column layout**:  Take a look around this page and talk to me about what you can do from here.

- You logged in from the homepage, and now you are seeing a page called My VA. How does that line up with your expectations?

- Is there anything confusing about having logged in from the homepage and now seeing a page called My VA?

## 3. Understand the homepage and My VA relationship - 3 minutes
From here, show me how you would get back to the homepage.

Talk to me about the difference between those two pages.

How would you use the homepage, now that you’re familiar with My VA?

Is one more useful than the other to start on?

## 4. Confirm redirect does not take user to My VA from other pages - 5 minutes

Thanks for sharing all of that. Now I’ll have you sign out.  

Now click on the payment history link under Disability.

Go ahead and click the prompt to sign in, and sign in.

## Post-Task Interview - 3 minutes
Thank you so much! That was everything I wanted you to review today. This has been really helpful for our team. Do you have any feedback on what we looked at today?
* Do you have any questions for me?

### Before we end this session, I have three additional questions for you about the study setup. I’ll ask the observers to leave the session at this time.
[wait for observers to leave]
1. How did you feel about having observers in this session?
2. Sometimes we have the observers already in the session when you join, instead of how we did it today. How do you feel about being asked for consent before the observers joined this session?
3. Thinking about the brief introductions with the observers, how did that make you feel?


## Thank-You and Closing - 1 minute
The feature we tested today is called a redirect - the website does not normally route you to My VA after you log in from the homepage. We turned that on for you just for this session, and we’ll turn it off later day. I want to give you a heads up about that in case you log in again and don’t experience that.  Once we release that feature in the coming weeks, your account will work like it did in the session today.

One more thing - I was wondering if you have any friends or family that might be interested in participating in future sessions? 

If yes - wonderful! It’s so helpful to have people participate in sessions like these. I’ll have our team send you a blurb you can pass along to them.

Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to test these updates today. 
This helps us to make sure everything will work when we launch these updates for all veterans on VA.gov.  I hope you enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit Strategy
We will be using the out of question exit strategy if an emergency arises:
* Exit strategy: We have covered all the questions I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback.
