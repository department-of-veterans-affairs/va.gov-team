# Research Plan for Authenticated Experience, My VA Redirect UAT, August 2022

## Background
To improve personalization and access to action items, we’re implementing a redirect so users are redirected to My VA when they log in from the homepage.  

If they log in from any other page, they will not be redirected to My VA.

See our [initiative brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/my-va-redirect/README.md) for more details.

### OCTO-DE Objectives 
This redirect will move us closer to fulfilling our north star objective of moving toward My VA being the one-stop shop for action items and benefit status. This will provide more direct, personalized routes to Veterans’ most critical updates and tasks

### Veteran Journey
Since My VA contains action items and benefit status anytime after a Veteran has established benefits with VA, this work impacts the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) from Starting Up and beyond.

## Research Goals	
1. Confirm that the redirect functions as expected.
2. Evaluate how the redirect does or doesn’t meet Veteran expectations.

### Research questions
- Does the functionality work as expected, for all login types and across devices?
- What do people want to do once they’ve landed on My VA?
- Are there any points of confusion?

### Hypothesis
- Veterans will be able to more quickly access what is most important to them since they can bypass the homepage.
- Veterans will not miss the homepage.
- The most common next step will be clicking on a link we surface in My VA.
- Veterans will use search if they can’t find what they’re looking for on My VA.


## Method	
We'll have participants go through a list of specific tasks for UAT, and ask follow-up questions to get feedback on our usability related questions.

### Location
Remote, via Zoom
