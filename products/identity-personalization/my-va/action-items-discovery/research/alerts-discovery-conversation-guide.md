## Intro - 3 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about finding locations on the VA.gov website and the information you see on those location pages.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** 
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing you, instead we are testing the website to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **Then, I'll be sharing my screen.** We'll look at the location finder together and I'll ask you a few questions about it.
- **You'll be participating in four exercises** that we will do together. 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

[Start recording to the Cloud]

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?" 


## Warm-up Questions - 10 minutes

- Can you tell me a little about yourself? (if needed, ask about service history)
- Do you currently, or have you ever, received any benefits from the VA?
- Do you currently, or have you ever, filed a claim or appeal with the VA?
- Have you logged-in to VA.gov recently?
- For what reasons do you visit VA locations?



- **I'll start with sharing my screen.**  


## Second Task: [DEFINE CURRENT STATUSES]  - 5 minutes

We're going to move onto the second exercise.

[PULLS UP OPTIMAL SORT]

Today, when a location is not operating with normal hours and services, we display 1 of 3 possible statuses. On the following screens, we’re going to look at these statuses and I’d like you to tell me how you interpret each of them.

    - Facility Closed
    - Facility notice 
    - Limited services

## Third Task: [MULTIPLE CHOICE - CHOOSE A STATUS]  - 5 minutes
 
[MULTIPLE CHOICE ACTIVITY]

On this third exercise, I'd like you to read over the blurb of text and choose which status you think it should have.

[MODERATOR HAS PARTICIPANT COMPARE AFTER ANSWERING]

- What are your thoughts overall about these three statuses for labels on facilities (Facility closed, Facility notice, Limited services) - do you feel like they are distinct and make sense? If so, what is distinct about the 3, what make them different from each other? If not, why are they not distinct?
- Are any parts confusing? If so, what is confusing? 

## Fourth Task: [CARD SORT 2 - OPEN SORT OF SCENARIOS] - 10 minutes

[CARD SORT PREP]

This is the 4th and final exercise.

We just went over three possibilities for statuses that you could see on a facility.

You mentioned those labels were confusing in **x ways** previously (or we suspect that veterans might find some of this categorization confusing), and we think Veterans might be able to come up with better status categories.

The white boxes contain various events that could affect facility hours and services and currently could result in seeing statuses like the ones we saw earlier. I’d like you to consider each event and sort them into categories. I’ll move them for you.

Afterwards you can create "statuses" that make sense to you. You could use the statuses we’ve already seen or create new statuses.

[CARD SORT]

**Feel free to think out loud as you work through the exercise.**

[AFTER CARD SORT]

[QUESTION]

- Ok, looking at theses categories, do you feel like they work for you?
- Can you talk me through how these categories might work as more useful statuses on the VA locations pages? You can rename them if you like. 
- Can you take a look at these specific cards and double check that the categories you've made are correct for them? If not feel free to make new categories or move things. 
   - "The facility is..."
- How do you think these categories you made compare to the three statuses we looked at before? (Facility closed, Facility notice, limited services)?
- You saw that in some of these cards, facilities were closed physcially but still oferring virtual services. What status would best fit that in your estimation?

[MODERATOR PULLS UP LOCATOR BRIEFLY TO REFRESH PARTICIPANT’S MEMORY]

[MODERATOR CLICKS INTO LOCATION ON LAMAR, CO]

- What about now? What can you tell me about the hours and services at this location?
- What would make you trust that the information on the listing/result is accurate?
- Can you think of a time when the information on a facility was unhelpful or inaccurate and affected your visit?

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

- Let's say you are vising a ceremony, do you think these statuses we've created would work for alerting you about what's happening at a cemetary? What might be different about that situation?
- Any questions for me? 

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
