## Intro - 3 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about finding locations on the VA.gov website and the information you see on those location pages.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** 
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing you, instead we are testing the website to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be participating in two exercises today.** We'll walk through these together. In one of the exercises, we will be working with a prototype - so it might not behave exactly how you expect.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

[Start recording to the Cloud]

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?" 

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

1. Can you tell me a little about yourself? (if needed, ask about service history)
2. What device are you joining us on?
3. Do you currently, or have you ever, received any benefits from the VA?
4. Do you currently, or have you ever, filed a claim or appeal with the VA?
5. (if yes) How do you check for any updates or changes to your benefits?
6. Have you ever used the My VA page on VA.gov? What do you use it for? 
7. How often do you go online to manage your benefits?

## BACKGROUND AND QUESTIONS - 5 minutes

Just a little bit of background before we start - we are working on building a central place for you to recieve any action items, updates or reminders on VA.gov. These could be anything related to health care, benefits or just general announcements. 

1. So let's imagine that this sort of page exits - a centralized place for any new updates, reminders or action items that you need to complete on VA.gov. What would you expect a page like this would be called?
2. What kind of information would you expect to be on a page like this? 
3. What are some scenarios in your life would want a page like this? 
4. Imagine that you do have new [USE THEIR WORD], how would you know? Where would you expect to see that on VA.gov? 

## PROTOTYPE - 25 minutes 

Great, let's move on. We're now going to take a look at a prototype. I'll share a link with you, and go ahead and pull that up and share your screen with me.

### Logistics: figure out how to share your screen - 5 minutes

- Confirm with the participant that they are using a mobile device with Zoom installed
- If not, backup plan - load VA.gov in a "mobile frame" - open VA.gov in Chrome. Hit Command+Alt+J.  Backup to backup - moderator shares screen.

Let's start by making sure you can figure out how to share your screen on Zoom.

**If they are on an iPhone**
* Tap ‘Share content’ (Green button at bottom middle of the screen) If you can’t see the zoom menu, tap anywhere on your screen once and it should appear.
* Tap on Screen
* Tap Zoom
* Tap start broadcast. After a count of 3, the entire device screen will be shared into the meeting
* Tap the red bar at the top of your screen when you are ready to end the share 
* IF THEY CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT
   * they can tap "share content" then tap "web URL" and just enter in VA.gov
* For troubleshooting screen sharing in iOS, reference the Zoom documentation here https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115005890803-iOS-Screen-Sharing   

**If they are on Android**
* Tap "Share"
* Tap "Screen"
* Tap Zoom
* May give a "sensitive info" alert
* May ask you to give Zoom permission to display over other apps, toggle yes. The hit the back arrow . Then it might just share your screen.
* Tap "Start now" (maybe)
* For Android troubleshooting, try here: https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362153-Sharing-your-screen

**Ask participant to be mindful of thinking outloud since you will not be able to see a mouse cursor go through the prototype**

Just a reminder - we are working with a prototype so it might not behave exactly how you expect. 

## First task - Scenario - 5 minutes

I'm going to give you a scenario. You've just logged into VA.gov. Imagine you've been recieving money from the VA for your education, you expected a payment this week  - but you aren't sure if it was deposited or not. How would you check on that? 

*If users DID click on alerts, skip to the third task*

*If users did NOT click on alerts:*

1. Why would you expect it to be in this section? 
2. What are you looking for here? 

## Second task - My VA - 7 minutes

Let's go ahead and click on 'My VA'. I have another scenario for you. Imagine you have a health care appointment coming up, but you can't remember when. How would you check that on this page? 

1. Why would you expect it to be in this section? 

- Let's take a look at the Alerts section on My VA. 

1. What are your thoughts on this section?
2. What would you expect to see this section on My VA?  
3. What do you think works about this section?
4. What do you find confusing here? 
5. What would you change about this section?
6. If you were to click on 'View all alerts', what would you expect to happen?  

Go ahead and click on 'View all alerts.

## Third task - Alerts - 10 minutes

Go ahead and scroll through this page and walk me through what you're seeing here. 

1. What are your thoughts about this page?
2. What would you expect to see on this page?  
3. What do you think works about this page?
4. What do you find confusing here? 
5. What would you change about this page?
6. What is missing on this page? 

Okay, great - any questions or thoughts before we move on?

*If users initially clicked on alerts, loop back to the second task*

## Fourth task - Alerts indicator - 1 minute

Go ahead and scroll to the top, and take a look at the 'Alerts' with the little bell and the red dot. 

1. What does that mean to you?
2. What is confusing about this?

Okay, great! That's it for the prototype, so we'll go ahead an move on to the next activity. 

## CARD SORT - 20 minutes (or remaining time)

- Okay, great. Let's go ahead and get started - **I'll start with sharing my screen.**  

[PULLS UP OPTIMAL SORT]

**[CARD SORT - ADDING CARDS]** 

On these cards that you can see here, we have a few potential action items that you might see on VA.gov. Go ahead and read through these. If you can think of any additional action items that you might want to see, let's go ahead an make cards for them. 

**[CARD SORT - SORTING]** 

So now that we have all of the potential action items that you'd like to see - let's sort these by priority. 

We'll make three columns: High, Medium, and Low priority. 

**Feel free to think out loud as you work through the exercise.**

[AFTER CARD SORT]

[QUESTIONS]

- Ok, looking at theses categories, do you feel like they work for you?
- Let's take a look at the high priority column - why did you put these updates in that column?
    - What makes an update 'High priority' to you? 
- Let's take a look at the low priority column - why did you put these updates in that column?
    - What makes an update 'Low priority' to you? 
- So if you could imagine a page with all of these updates, how could you tell which ones are high priority vs low priority? 
- Any additional thoughts or questions?

## CLOSING QUESTIONS - TIME PERMITTING - 2 minutes

1. How did these pages meet your expectations? 
2. How did these pages not meet your expectations?
3. Do you think you would or would not use these pages when you log in to VA.gov? Why?
    - if no: What would make this page more useful to you?

## Thank-You and Closing 

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
