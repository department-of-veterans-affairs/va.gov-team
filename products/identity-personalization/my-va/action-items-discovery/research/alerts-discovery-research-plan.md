# Research Plan for VSA Authenticated Experience: Action Items Discovery July/August 2021

## Goals

As an enhancement to the new My VA dashboard, our team is looking to give Veterans access to their recent action items in a centralized place. We aim to understand the best way to implement the new action items feature on VA.gov. This includes:
 
- How do users expect to find their action items? 
- How do users expect to take action on their action items?
- What action items do users expect to see?
- Do users expect their action items to be ordered in a certain way? If so, how?

## Background


In many past user interviews, users have expressed the importance of having relevant or time-sensitive action items elevated.  Our goal is to create a centralized place for recent action items that will improve the personalized experience for Veterans, by helping users complete important tasks efficiently, as well as be aware of any upcoming events and/or status changes.  This new 'Alerts' feature (name to be determined) aims to surface any important health care, claim and/or benefit information.

- [Comparative analysis)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/action-items-discovery/action-items-comparative%20analysis.md)

## Research questions

- What are the most important scenarios that need action for users?
- What are the least important action items for users?
- How do people expect to see these action items?
- How do people expect their action items to be ordered?
- How do users expect to be able to resolve these action items?
- Do people expect to go to My VA to see notifications?
- Is it useful to have alerts on My VA?
- Is duplication helpful? (indicator + actual notification)
- How do users think of action items? (eg a to-do list or more of a notification?)
- What does a 'new' alert mean? (eg when should they see an indicator in the navigation)
- Do users want to see all the alerts theyâ€™ve ever had?
- What should this section be called?? (alerts, notifications, action items??)
- How do people know if a task is complete?
- What information about an action item do people need to see?

## Hypothesis & assumptions

- Users will be able to find alerts easily using the omni-present alert in the navigation.
- Users will likely not go to My VA first to view alerts. 
- There will potentially be some confusion around finishing a task because in the current design we do not differentiate between what is done/unfinished.
- People will want to be able to sort the alerts hub page. 


## Method

- We will be running remote moderated usability testing via Zoom on mobile using the Perigean contract.

- We will conduct an initial [card sort exercise](https://app.mural.co/t/vsa8243/m/vsa8243/1628612585149/29d89d512c9cd7cb8fe8b16ac0eb0fa2604b73e9?sender=tressafurner7646). We will use Mural to help the Veteran sort which notifications are highest priority. The moderator (Tressa) will manage all the interactions on Mural, since we think Veterans might have trouble navigating this tool themselves.  
- This will be followed by a qualitative interview, using a [prototype in UX-pin.](https://preview.uxpin.com/aeb04fa2c4989723cf9b60e6d47e311ae3a4cd78#/pages/140666348)

## Participants and Recruitment

Recruit for 12 sessions (8 fulfilled sessions) using the following criteria:

### Must have for participants

- 12 participants (for a minimum of **8** completed sessions)

- We will need at least 5 participants who are eligible/currently receive health care from the VA. Please confirm this prior to sessions.

- We will need at least 5 participants who have active claims or appeals. (This may or may not overlap with users who have health care) Please confirm this prior to sessions.

- All participants must be LOA3 (identity verified) on VA.gov. Participants will likely not know what this means, so please confirm this prior to testing. To confirm this, please:
  -  Have users sign into VA.gov with any of their credentials
  -  Direct them to go to their VA.gov profile, or send them the URL: va.gov/profile/personal-information
  -  If they are prompted to verify their identity, that means they are LOA1 and they are not suitable for testing 
  -  If they can see their personal and contact information in the profile, they are LOA3 and can participate in testing

- Participants must be people who visit VA.gov using their mobile devices.

- Participants must be able to join our Zoom call from their mobile devices (app required).

- We will not be able to accommodate non-sighted users due to the prototype technology.

#### Secondary criteria / Would like to have

- 50% aged 55-64+
- 50% with an identified cognitive disability
- 50% primarily mobile users

- 25% in a rural area(anecdotally quoted at 45% by David Shulkin)
- 25% without a degree
- 17% with immigrant origins
- 10% women
