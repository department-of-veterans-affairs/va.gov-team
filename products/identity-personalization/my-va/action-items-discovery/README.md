## Overview

Action items, ie. items on which the VA needs action from a veteran to move a process forward, are the most important thing that veterans want to see on their dashboard. We've heard this in multiple studies, including in [Liz's 2020 discovery work](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/discovery-summary.md#veterans-care-about-anything-they-have-in-flight-whether-that-is-education-or-other-benefits), [usability testing on initial My VA 2.0 explorations](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/product/Research/MyVA-research-findings.md#details-of-findings), [usability testing on the final My VA 2.0 prototype](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/product/Research%20V2/MyVA2-research-findings.md#features-users-expected-to-see-that-were-missing), and Tressa's recent ["mini usability" study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/MyVA-mini-usability/My%20VA-mini-usability-findings.md).

However, action items are currently spread throughout My VA, and as we add functionality over time, it could be hard to find specific action needed items, especially if they are buried at the bottom of My VA. We should explore how we can more effectively elevate action items in order to create a scalable strategy. 

## Problem Statement

As a Veteran, I need to know if the VA needs something from me in order for me to receive or manage my benefits.

## Opportunities 

We can fix this by doing a better job of elevating action items on VA.gov, whether that is on My VA or another section/page (eg. the nav, a new section, etc).

## User Outcomes

### Desired User Outcomes

- Veterans will be able to find and complete necessary tasks more quickly.
- As a result, Veterans may receive benefits or other outcomes more quickly.

### Undesired User Outcomes

- Confusion or lack of syncing between on-site notifications/action items and email, text, or mail communications (data integrity).

## Business Outcomes

### Desired Business Outcomes

- We'll potentially have a consolidated place to elevate action items on VA.gov, so everything isn't so silo'd.
- It will be easier for teams to get necessary action items in front of users than it is now.

### Undesired Business Outcomes

- This becomes another point of confusion if it isn't sync'd with the email/text communications we have going out.

## Measuring Success

### Objectives and Key results (OKRs)

- **Objective**: Explore how we can effectively elevate Veterans' action items on VA.gov. 
  - **Key result**: Veterans validate potential solutions through user research and testing.

---

## Assumptions

- Veterans expect to see action items at the very top of their screen.
- Veterans expect action items to appear in a notification menu in the main nav.

## Solution Approach
 
We plan to conduct a few sprints of discovery to learn more about how we could elevate action items and some approaches we might take on VA.gov. This will likely include the following: 
 
- Comparative analysis of how action items are surfaced on other websites/tools. There may already be some good documentation on this from Liz's initial My VA discovery.
- Low-fi sketching/mockups: Iterate on a few ideas, keeping in mind how or if this might change the current design, and in what ways.
- Figuring out the best method for testing our hypotheses with Veterans — is it usability testing? Click testing? Moderated or unmoderated?
- Running research.
- Writing up and recommendations for potential implementation into the My VA experience.

--- 

## Go-to-market Strategy

- This is a discovery effort that will help us determine if or how we want to pursue this work on VA.gov. Based on our findings, we'll determine whether formal design/build are the right next steps.


## Launch Dates

- We hope to have this work completed early in Q3 (July - September) of 2021.
