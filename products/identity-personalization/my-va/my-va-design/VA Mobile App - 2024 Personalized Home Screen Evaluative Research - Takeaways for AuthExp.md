_The documentation and deck created by the Mobile App team should be reviewed in addition to this document of takeaways that are relevant for Authenticated Experience. Some of what is stated here was covered in the presentation of findings that occured on July 30th, 2024 in a Mobile Sprint demo meeting._

## Accessibility considerations

### The research effort was unable to recruit any screen reader users. To try and compensate for that gap, as well to simply educate assistive tech users in general, the mobile team:
  - Went through additional a11y review internally.
  - Are setting up sessions with blind veterans groups to demo their new functionality in the hope that this can help facilitate educating veterans who use assitive tech. Martha Wilkes can help us facilitate our own demos for blind veteran organizations. 
 
## Other takeaways
- Issues that correspond with vets-api may be causing issues with the display of military info in the personalized app experience, including the display of military branch. It is unclear if this has any direct relevance to the web personalized experience (such as with the Nametag component and Profile), more investigation may be required. 
- "All participants recognized that the Activity modules on the home screen displayed their personalized information and seemed to understand that the description text on each module indicated that something that was 'in-flight,' however, not all participants described the presence of the Activity module itself as indicating that something was an 'in-flight task." This finding may or may not also apply to our own items that are in-progress displayed on My VA.

- "Two participants joined the session without having Zoom installed in advance—this was disruptive, but not impossible to work around (we were eventually able to run the session using the moderator’s mobile device). A recruiter follow-up with each remaining participant ensured Zoom was installed prior to the session and made for quick & easy setup." We should be mindful in our own studies of ensuring that participants are reminded that they will need to use Zoom and should have it pre-installed.
