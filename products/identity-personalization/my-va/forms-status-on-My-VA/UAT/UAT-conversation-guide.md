# Conversation Guide: Forms Status on My VA UAT, October 2024

### Project-specific setup

- **Ensure that all toggles are enabled**

## Introduction - 1 minute

Thanks for joining me today! My name is Matt. I am a researcher and designer who works on improving the VA.gov website so Veterans can get what they need quickly and easily.

VA.gov is introducing new functionality that allows Veterans to track the status of benefit applications and related forms they've recently submitted. I’m meeting with people like yourself to help me test these updates to make sure they are working as expected in the user interface. 

Before we start, I wanted to go over a few details:

- **This session should take 30 minutes of your time or less.** It involves me asking you to complete a few small tasks. Because I want to make sure we don’t keep you beyond 30 minutes, I may prompt you with the next question to keep things moving.
- **I will ask that you share your screen for part of our session today, in order to see that everything is working correctly** While we won’t be recording this session, we will be able to see some of your real information today. This may include some healthcare information and some claims information. However, you have the choice to stop screen sharing during any of the tasks, and start again when you feel comfortable.
- **For us to test things fully, you will need to have submitted a form within the last 60 days.** If you have not, then we cannot proceed. Please let me know if you have or not, or if you are planning on completing the form

Also, I have some teammates who would like to observe our session and take notes for me, but only if you're comfortable with that. They'll be muted and off camera and you won't have to interact with them. Would you be okay with that, or do you prefer to keep the session just the two of us?

Do you have any questions for me before we begin?

## Setup - 5 minutes

What forms have you submitted recently, in roughly the last 60 days?

Do you intend on completing a new form while in this session? 
  - If so, include Task 1A in testing

_Get screen sharing in Zoom started_

### Task 1: Sign in

Please go to VA.gov and sign in with your credentials. 

- Success based on: completion of sign in. 

### Task 1A (Optional, depends on participants): Complete one of the 8 MVP-supported forms

### Task 2: Look at Benefit applications and forms section

### Conclusion

Alright, that's everything we wanted help testing with today. Thank you for taking the time to help us improve the VA.gov website! Do you have any additional questions before we close out?

(After any questions are answered)

Thank you again, and I hope you have a great rest of your day!
