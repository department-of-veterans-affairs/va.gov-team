# Conversation Guide: Forms Status on My VA UAT, September 2024

### Project-specific setup

- **Ensure that all toggles are enabled**

## Introduction - 1 minute

Thanks for joining me today! My name is Matt. I am a researcher and designer who works on improving the VA.gov website so Veterans can get what they need quickly and easily.

VA.gov is introducing new functionality that allows Veterans to track the status of benefit applications and related forms they've recently submitted. I’m meeting with people like yourself to help me test these updates to make sure they are working as expected in the user interface. 

Before we start, I wanted to go over a few details:

- **This session should take 30 minutes of your time or less.** It involves me asking you to complete a few small tasks. Because I want to make sure we don’t keep you beyond 30 minutes, I may prompt you with the next question to keep things moving.
- **I will ask that you share your screen for part of our session today, in order to see that everything is working correctly** While we won’t be recording this session, we will be able to see some of your real information today. This may include some healthcare information and some claims information. However, you have the choice to stop screen sharing during any of the tasks, and start again when you feel comfortable.
- **For us to test things fully, you will need to have submitted a form within the last 60 days.** If you have not, then we cannot proceed. Please let me know if you have or not. 

Also, I have some teammates who would like to observe our session and take notes for me, but only if you're comfortable with that. They'll be muted and off camera and you won't have to interact with them. Would you be okay with that, or do you prefer to keep the session just the two of us?

Do you have any questions for me before we begin?
