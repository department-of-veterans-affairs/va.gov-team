## Overview 
The previous Authenticated Experience team launched an MVP for the 'Form Status' on MyVA. That work did not include the PDF download functionality for submitted forms, and it excluded many forms and focused on a narrow subset of forms using the benefits intake API. This follow up effort is to expand to all forms using the Benefits Intake API

## Epic Details
