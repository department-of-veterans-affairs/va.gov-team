# Forms Status on My VA MVP Frontend Documentation
Last updated: August 20, 2024

This FE documentation outlines all possible status cards that appear in the Benefit applications and forms section on My VA: 

- Drafts
- Submission in progress
- Received
- Action needed (an error state specific to an individual form submission)

It also outlines the accordion component with the title "If you can't find your application or form" that appears at the bottom of this section.

In addition, this documentation accounts for possible scenarios in which no draft or form statuses can be displayed in the entirety of the section:

- Failed user call
- Failed network call
- Failed API call
- Scheduled maintenance

## When to show the ‘Benefit applications and forms' section
We show this section for every LOA3 user.

This component is visible in all scenarios EXCEPT for error scenarios in which no forms or drafts can be displayed (API fail, Network call fail, scheduled maintenance).

It provides information to help inform users why a draft or a form they have submitted previously is not appearing in the Benefit applications and forms section of the page.

The accordion appears below the entirety of form and draft cards


If there are no form or draft card(s):

You have no benefit applications or forms to show.


**Visual specs**
- [The accordion component's bordered variant from the VA design system is utilized](https://design.va.gov/components/accordion)
- Typography: 'h3', 'vads-font-size-base' with bolded text using 'vads-font-weight-bold', tag component uses its default 'regular' font style
- Link style: 'default'

### Collapsed state

**Content**

If you can't find your application or form

### Expanded state

**Content**

If you can’t find a draft application or form, it may have expired. We only save draft applications and forms for a limited time. This helps us protect your personal data. After a draft application or form expires, you’ll need to start over.

If you can’t find an application or form you submitted, that doesn’t mean that we didn’t receive it. 

We're offering a new feature for some forms that helps you track those forms from the time you submit the form online to when we confirm that we've received it.

We'll show the status of these select forms here for 60 days after you submit the form:
- Authorize the release of non-VA medical information to VA (VA Form 21-4142 & 21-4142a)
- Submit a lay or witness statement to support a VA claim (VA Form 21-10210)
- Request priority processing for an existing claim (VA Form 20-10207)
- Authorize VA to release your information to a third-party source (VA Form 21-0845)
- Sign VA claim forms as an alternate signer (VA Form 21-0972)
- Submit an intent to file (VA Form 21-0966)
- Request to be a substitute claimant for a deceased claimant (VA Form 21P-0847)

If you have questions about your applications or forms, call us at 800-827-1000 (TTY: 711). We’re here Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. ET.

## When form status cards besides drafts appear

For MVP, [7 forms are tracked and displayed on My VA](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/VA.gov-team-forms/blob/main/Product/2024-05%20VFF%20and%20My%20VA%20Form%20Submission%20Research/Research/MVP-form-list.md):

- Submit an intent to file (VA Form 21-0966)
- Request to be a substitute claimant for a deceased claimant (VA Form 21P-0847)


Once one of these forms are submitted, they will be represented as a card on My VA. The cards with the statuses of submission in progress, received, and action needed correspond to these forms.

## Form Status card - Action Needed

This is an **error state** for an individual form submission. This occurs after submission and before it would be received. When detected errors (aka detectable "silent errors") occur during the submission process of supported forms, the associated form cannot be processed by VA staff. In all likelihood, the form will have to be redone and resubmitted. To inform users, we display the "Action needed" card to indicate a system error took place and that they should contact the VA via the Benefits Hotline.


**Show card**
- When detected errors (aka detectable "silent errors") occur during the submission process of supported forms.
  
**Do NOT show card**
- There are no detected system errors during the submission process of any of the user's forms (_however_ it is possible that an undetected error occurred in unknown scenarios - use cases of "Action needed" may expand over time).

**Visual specs**
- The Card component in [VADS](https://design.va.gov/components/card#variations) is used, with the default white background variation.
- The Tag component in [VADS](https://design.va.gov/components/tag) is also used.
- 'Error alert' variation of the Alert component in [VADS](https://design.va.gov/components/alert#error-alert) is used on the card.
