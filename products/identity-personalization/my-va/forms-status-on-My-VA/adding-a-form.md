## Introduction
Currently, we have two types of forms that are already able to show the Form Status:
- Online forms
- Uploadable forms

Forms can display **four statuses**:

1. **DRAFT**  
2. **SUBMISSION IN PROGRESS**  
3. **RECEIVED**  
4. **ACTION NEEDED**

> This guide covers statuses **2–4**, as **DRAFT** is handled by the Save-in-Progress (SiP) implementation.  
> For more details, see the [SiP guide](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/va-forms-library-how-to-set-up-save-in-progress-si).

---

### Form Status Card
There are two title/heading display options for the status card, depending on whether the form is uploadable or has the SiP feature:

| Uploadable Form | Form with SiP |
|-----------------|---------------|
| <img width="421" height="256" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-24 at 10 26 45" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/712288b1-641e-4688-a392-e8379e35ccc0" /> | <img width="417" height="280" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-16 at 14 24 44" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd963ee3-35ad-4c8a-9145-351555e73cd6" /> |

- **Uploadable forms** use a fallback title: `"VA Form XX-XXXX"`  
- **SiP forms** use the title defined in `vets-website` with a subheading: `"VA Form XX-XXXX"` (for details see [Instructions for teams, step 3](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/va-forms-library-how-to-set-up-save-in-progress-si))  


## Form Status Workflow

### High-Level Workflow

> Refer to the [original diagram](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/blob/7693b23eafaabac7c52a288ce89ae04d45972170/products/identity-personalization/my-va/form-status/backend_documentation.md#form-status-workflow) for a visual overview.


### `vets-api` Workflow

> Use this workflow when implementing API-level status retrieval.

> ⚠️ These forms need further investigation on why they're not showing a status card upon successful submission (https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/117244)

## Begin Implementation for Non-Benefits Intake API Forms

### Initial Decisions

Before implementation, discuss and answer the following:

- Show status for **all forms** in the new Form API or a restricted list?  
- Use a **Flipper toggle**?  
- Are you the **first form** for this Form API?  
  - Existing Gateway & Formatter available?  
  - Example: `BenefitsIntakeGateway` + `BenefitsIntakeFormatter`  
- Do your form statuses **match the standard statuses**?  
  - Map any different statuses in `vets-website/src/applications/personalization/dashboard/helpers.jsx` under `SUBMISSION_STATUS_MAP`.

> Depending on your answers, you will fall into one of two categories:
> 1. **First form team for this API** (e.g., Form 21-0781 → Lighthouse Documents Intake API)  
> 2. **Not the first form team** (follow existing restrictions or patterns)  

---

## Using `restricted_list_of_forms`

To use this path, ensure the following exist:
  ```
       ✔️ Gateway matching your Form API
    
       ✔️ Formatter matching your Gateway
   ```

If your form status **does not appear** upon successful submission, the first team likely used the restricted approach.

You can continue with the same approach or discuss removing restrictions and allowing all forms for your Form API to show a status.

### Continue with the restriscted approach

ℹ️ In our `app/controllers/v0/my_va/submission_statuses_controller.rb` we have a list of Allowed Forms.

```ruby
      def restricted_list_of_forms
        %w[
          20-10206
          20-10207
          21-0845
          21-0972
          21-10210
          21-4142
          21-4142a
          21P-0847
        ] + uploadable_forms
      end
```

Implementation Steps:

1.	Add your form ID (e.g., 21-4138) or ensure it’s in uploadable_forms.
2.	Update or add tests in the respective Formatter/Gateway spec.
3.	Test locally to confirm the form status card appears.

## Brand New Form API Connection

ℹ️ Please refer to the diagram focused on the [`vets-api` Workflow](#vets-api-workflow) for a refresher on the flow/pattern you will be adding to.

If no Gateway/Formatter exists for your Form API, congratulations! You get to be the first 🎉:

1.	Create a Gateway to fetch status from your Form API.
2.	Add the newly created Gateway to `lib/forms/submission_statuses/report.rb`:
   - determine a service name, this will make sure the correct formatter is used for your data

```ruby
  def initialize(user_account:, allowed_forms:)
    @gateways = [
      { service: 'lighthouse_benefits_intake',
        gateway: BenefitsIntakeGateway.new(user_account:, allowed_forms:) },
      { service: 'your_new_service_name',
        gateway: YourNewGateway.new() }
    ]
  end
```
        
3.	Create a Formatter for your API data

Example input in `BenefitsIntakeFormatter`:

  ```ruby
    # Submissions data froms from the FormSubmission query
    submissions = [
      {
        benefits_intake_uuid: "123",
        form_type: "526EZ",
        created_at: "2023-01-01"
      }
    ]
    
    # Intake statuses data that comes from the BenefitsIntakeGateway
    statuses = [
      {
        "attributes" => {
          "guid" => "123",
          "detail" => "Processing",
          "message" => "Form received",
          "status" => "pending",
          "updated_at" => "2023-01-02"
        }
      }
    ]
  ```

Output format must match the following example structure:

```ruby
    [
        OpenStruct.new(
          id: "123", # this should be the ID in the Form API
          form_type: "526EZ",
          created_at: "2023-01-01",
          updated_at: "2023-01-02",
          detail: "Processing",
          message: "Form received",
          status: "pending",
          pdf_support: true # determined by PdfUrls class
        )
    ]
```
  
4.	Add Formatter to `lib/forms/submission_statuses/report.rb`:
   - use the service name you determined in the gateway list
   
```ruby
      FORMATTERS = {
        'lighthouse_benefits_intake' => Formatters::BenefitsIntakeFormatter.new,
        'your_new_service_name' => Formatters::YourNewFormatter.new
      }.freeze
```

5. Update/add tests and test locally to confirm the status card displays correctly.
6. Test locally to confirm the form status card appears
