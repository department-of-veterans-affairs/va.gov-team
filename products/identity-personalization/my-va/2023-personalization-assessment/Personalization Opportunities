<h1>VA Personalization Opportunities</h1>

<i>This set of opportunities, primarily focused on My VA and Profile, were documented and discussed on Dec. 14, 2023</i>

1. My VA name
- Not obvious what this means to a new user. Recommend looking at alternatives, potentially find a way to better combine Profile and My VA into one entity. 

2. Order of contents of My VA should be altered for the sake of prioritization. 
- My proposal would ensure the most important action items would be located at the top, in order from most important to least if organization remains the same:
    - Go to your profile
    - Benefit Applications Draft
    - Outstanding Debts
    - Benefit Payment
    - Health Care </ul>
    - Education and Training

3. Alerts in general    
My VA is intended to provide “Veterans with a direct route to their most critical tasks and updates” - As I see it currently, it is not doing so as effectively as it could. The fact that a user needs to scroll to find their most pressing action items, versus notifying them immediately, is a missed opportunity.

5. Nametag component
- This provides value to users, primarily by giving peace of mind via showing the disability rating. I see a possibility of improving the name tag by either using real estate more efficiently and/or providing any other data that might be beneficial.

6. Profile link
- What is in Profile vs. My VA isn’t necessarily obvious. I recommend doing more to distinguish it, by indicating what Profile includes (or approaching it some other completely different way)

7. Nav redundancy
- With the signed-in user’s dropdown menu in the top right corner as well as nav on the mega menu and My VA, there are now several ways to get to the same content. I’m curious what exploration has been done about that so far? I saw a past note on Mural indicating that having My VA as a link in multiple places might be necessary due to a11y concerns - I’d like to learn more. 

8. Different navigation patterns going with these can also be problematic. 

9. Past debts/records of payment of debts 
- There is no debt payment history reference or associated links on My VA. I would expect this to be viewable as well. 

10. Benefits application drafts
- When there are no active drafts, this section seems like wasted real estate on the page. This could be hidden when there are no drafts (I would even suggest we could remove it all together and put any drafts in the Claims and Appeals section, on cards that clearly indicate it’s a draft. 
    - Q: how often do people start an app and not complete it in a single session? Do we have any data to indicate that?

11. Conditional treatment of sections could be slow, decision to have them all the time was made to counter that

12. Claim statuses (and statuses in general)
- The use of the green checkmark icon on the various steps isn’t necessarily helpful - it implies completion when a claim isn’t actually done. I’m curious to know more about any research related to those icons and how they are interpreted by users. 
- The In Progress tag at the top of cards is used inconsistently sitewide as well.

13. Text contrast color
   - It appears some usage of the gray colored text that appears on cards/pages is not WCAG AAA compliant. Ideally, all content should strive to be AAA compliant. This should be reviewed/discussed with the design system team to better assess how we could improve readability for users with vision impairment. In addition, any other instances of text that may have contrast issues with background colors should be assessed as well. 

15. Placement of Letters page
- This seems like something that would be appropriate on the My VA page as well, not just buried as a signed-in menu item. 

16. Caregiver resources
-As there is no caregiver user type (yet), perhaps there is opportunity to include resources/options here? 

17. Search functionality
- Search is a prominent element on the unauth. home page - do we know how often users are relying on that search field specifically (versus the mega menu’s search)? Maybe there are opportunities there. 

18. Account Security - unclear of value
- Does this even need to exist? Why was this included in the first place? To encourage people to be more secure? 
    - What value are users themselves getting from this?
    - 2-factor authentication isn’t a thing that everyone knows. If it’s going to be referred to in this context, a brief definition makes sense. 
    - What does this look like when identity hasn’t been verified/no 2fa?
    - Used to be more to do there, had to accept ToS for MyHealtheVet

19. We cannot alter experience based on user type
- Any potential flexibility could offer personalized notifications, actions, and content

20. Claims - maybe some opportunities with how we present different kinds of claims (visual styling, statuses, etc.
