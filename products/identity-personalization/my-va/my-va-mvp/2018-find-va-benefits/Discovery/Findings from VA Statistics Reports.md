# Findings from [2010 National Survey of Veterans](https://www.va.gov/vetdata/docs/SurveysAndStudies/NVSSurveyFinalWeightedReport.pdf)

Caveats:
- This data is 8 years old -- take it with a grain of salt, though suspicion is that the numbers still largely hold true
- These findings drove the mandate to create [explore.va.gov](https://explore.va.gov), their primary aim being to solve these discoverability issues

## Overall benefit awareness and understanding

### Percentage of Veterans indicating they understood their benefits "A lot" or "some"

## Reasons for not applying for a benefit

### Top 5 reasons for not applying across all benefit verticals

1. Not aware of the benefit
2. Don't need the benefit
3. Never thought about it / never considered applying
4. Don't know how to apply
5. Don't think I'm entitled/eligible

### Noteable insights on particular benefits

- Disability benefits and VR&E: "don't need the benefit" is closely tied to "don't think I'm entitled", "don't think disability is severe enough", and "dont need or want assistance from VA"
- Health care & burial benefits are the most common where Veterans are likely to get the service somewhere else
- Core reasons against applying for home loans and burial benefits were due to inconvenience of the home loan program and distance of VA cemeteries, respectively
- Many more Veterans are unaware of life insurance than any other benefit
- Expiration of education benefits and lapse of life insurance benefits are common

### Relevant statistics
