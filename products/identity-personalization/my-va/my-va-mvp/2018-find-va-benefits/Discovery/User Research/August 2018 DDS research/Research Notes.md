# Participant 1

**Background**

* Active duty Air Force.
* Has not used Vets.gov

**1. What are your thoughts and impressions of "What benefits are you interested in?"**

Questions that arise:

* Is it going to limit me? Can I change my answers later?
* Can I check all?
* Will it sign me up for an email list?

*Samara: Does this question/this content mean anything to you?*

* No, all benefits should be available. This feels arbitrary. These should all be things I can get info on.
* "It seems arbitrarily limiting."

**2. What information would be helpful to see after you click "Submit?"**

* Assuming ther are tabs with benefits and you could add more later.
* Each section would be a category — "This is healthcare."
* "Information is called out more explicitly based on what I selected."
* Specifically, the dashboard should:
  * Call out mental health.
  * Have a phone number for a VA benefits counselor.
  * Application for benefits.
  * If you have signed up for benefits already, it should show the current status of those benefits.
  * Outstanding bills to you or the VA.
  
*Participant sketch of what this would look like*

**3. What are your thoughts and impressions of "Which of these circumstances apply to you?"**

* "Lots of words" in the example. 
* Likes this more approach more because you an pick what's applicable to you.
* Action verbs give him confidence that behind the page it will help him to answer the questions he has.
* This approach needs a "not listed" option.
* "It makes it so I am saying I have these problems and the VA is offerring me help." It feels less like a giant organization saying I have to you help. 
* "This is huge. It's big." re: inviting language.

**4. Would you expect to see the same information, or different information, on the next page than you would for the "What benefits are you interested in?" prompt?**

* "I'd expect to see the process is continued."
* "I'd expected to see a "Turbo Tax" version of this." More questions to pair down the list of what he might look at next. It might even go directly into the application for the benefit.
* "It feels like the first step in a process that might help you."
* Wants an indicator of how far along he is in the process.

# Participant 2

**Background**

* Active duty Marines.
* Has not used Vets.gov

**1. What are your thoughts and impressions of "What benefits are you interested in?"**

* "I don't know what the impact is if I choose this." Will he get a call from someone? An email? A letter? A "useless" pamphlet? Will a caseworker call?
* Would click the "Read More" link to learn more about benefits before selecting them from the list.
* "My assumption is a very high number of people would be interested in health benefits."
* "I get slightly annoyed when I'm asked a question the system should already know." — Re: eligibility. To him, the system should know if he is eligble or not.
* Education would be useful for him personally.
* Employment benefits — When you leave the military, you have to go through tons of employment related training. The way things are present makes it feel like DoD related-training information didn't get transferred over to the VA.
* Life insurance — It's easy for people in the millitary to miss this. "That one would be like, 'Oh, I didn't consider that'."
* Home loans — Some people may already have experience with it. Realtor should take care of this. Hasn't had issues with this IRL.
* Pension — This means thay you've been in the service for 20 years. At this point, you would already know a lot more about these benefits than someone who enlisted at 18.
* Memorial — This has a unique audience, and they would assumed they'd be routed to an actual person. They probably have a huge distrust of the system and they know they need to talk to an actual person at this point to get things done.

**2. What information would be helpful to see after you click "Submit?"**

* If you're on Vets.gov, it's for a reason. Someone told you to go here. You have a purpose.
* Would expect to see something along the lines of "What are you trying to accomplish today?" Would want to be able to make progress on that goal and would want to be able to table things he wasn't going to do that day.
* Whatever information we show shouldnt get in the way of other goals people might have. People may have come to the site to do different things than whatever we wanted to prompt them with.
* For "first day interactions" (ie. the first time you sign into the site), he expects you might want to do 3 – 4 specific things:
  * Sign up for healthcare.
  * Getting your account set up.
  * Loan-related info.
  * GI Bill related info.
  * Disabilty/Pension/Memorial would be less important (it sounded like he was specifically referring to a younger audience).

**3. What are your thoughts and impressions of "Which of these circumstances apply to you?"**

* Thinks the question is asked in a better way. Better to ask what someone needs right now.
* Unclear —> Should he tell the site what he cares about in the moment, or what he'll care about in a month or year? It sounds like the issue is that he wants to be able to update this information later on to keep them relevant.

**4. Would you expect to see the same information, or different information, on the next page than you would for the "What benefits are you interested in?" prompt?**

* His expecations are relatively the same as for the first screen, but he would expect another questionnaire on the same page because he expects the VA to ask a lot of questions that don't lead anywhere.
* Otherwise, would want to see a list of what he needs to get done.
* Whether he would come back later would depend on how good his first experience was.

# Participant 3

**Background**

* Active duty Army 2nd lieutenant.
* Has not used Vets.gov

**1. What are your thoughts and impressions of "What benefits are you interested in?"**

* Doesn't like that disability and healthcare are at the top of the list. As someone in his 20s, education and employment related tops care higher priorities to him.
* Would click "Read More about Benefits."
  * Healthcare can be so many things.
  * "I don't know what memorial benefits are."
  * Education/training — more elaboration here on what each category is. Even a sentence would be helpful.
  * Disability — "Am I starting, stopping, or updating my benefits."

**2. What information would be helpful to see after you click "Submit?"**

* Would expect to see additional resources.
  * Information you can read about each benefit.
  * "We'll be in contact with you." — Would expect a point of contact to help him work through things.
  * Would like a live chat feature so he could ask someone questions more immediately.
* Wants there to be step-by-step functionality to see what he's done and where he needs to go.
* Also mentioned questionnaire-like functionality — "Are you interested in X or Y?" to narrow the scope of what he's looking at.

**3. What are your thoughts and impressions of "Which of these circumstances apply to you?"**

* Likes this approach better.
* Makes it into an action — "'I am interested'... it empowers me." It makes him feel like he's not getting a handout, like he's doing something.
* Feels like he would be more confident in answering this question and would not need to read more information about each benefit before selecting them from the list.

**4. Would you expect to see the same information, or different information, on the next page than you would for the "What benefits are you interested in?" prompt?**

* Expectations on what would happen would be somewhat different. He would expect more of a guided process that would ask him questions about his specific experiences to further tailor results for him
  * He used education as an example — The system might ask things like, "Where are you going to school? When?"
* The outcome would still be a point of contact and additional resources BUT the results would be much more tailored.

# Participant 4

**Background**

* Active duty Army.
* Leaving the service soon and has been through TAP.
* Has not used Vets.gov but has heard of it because it was mentioned in TAP.

**1. What are your thoughts and impressions of "What benefits are you interested in?"**

* Lots of options. "What happens when I submit? Do I receive an email?"
* Would expect a tool tip for each benefit that gave more information about it. Eg. is Education GI Bill related?
* Does already know what benefits are from TAP.
* No downside to checking all the checkboxes, but probably wouldn't check the pension box because he's not retiring.
* Thinks most people would be interested in all benefits and wonders if an opt-out approach is better.

**2. What information would be helpful to see after you click "Submit?"**

* Confirmation of what he submitted.
* "Are there actions on the VA's part? Are they going to call me? What do I need to do to become enrolled?"
  * Eg. the disability application — would want to know how to track this process.

**3. What are your thoughts and impressions of "Which of these circumstances apply to you?"**

* Needs to be more succinct copy-wise.
* If he's super busy he might gloss over this kind of prompt because there are too many words.

**4. Would you expect to see the same information, or different information, on the next page than you would for the "What benefits are you interested in?" prompt?**

* Different expectations — this will drive what we'd ask him for later. If we are asking this there must be a workflow behind it. It's like a call center — they ask you a bunch of questions to figure out how to direct your call.
* Outcome of the questions — more tailored results.
  * Eg. Education — what's your level of education? Do you want to go to school remotely? Do you qualify for the GI bill?
    * Next steps
      * Confirm answers
      * Next Steps
        * Notification of what programs might be right for him
        * Contact information
        * Next steps in the process
   * Disability
     * How to file
     * Status of claim
     * Next steps
* Would be nice to have live chat functionality.
  
# Participant 5

**Background**

* Veteran.
* Has used Vets.gov.

**1. What are your thoughts and impressions of "What benefits are you interested in?"**

* Isn't sure if this questionnaire will actually meet his needs.
* Wants to know more about the benefits — what kind of healthcare might he receive?
* Already knows enough about employment, home loan, pension.
* Has personal concerns around memorial benefits.

**2. What information would be helpful to see after you click "Submit?"**

* Would want to see all the information he needed in order to make an informed decision whether he should apply for a benefit or not.
* Eg. Disability — Apply; Different kinds of claim; What conditions are claimable and what is not?
* Same for healthcare — wants to see all the information to answer the questions he might have.

**3. What are your thoughts and impressions of "Which of these circumstances apply to you?"**

* Thinks this approach is helpful because he might have had questions that lined up with the statements posed.
* Does not feel he would respond to this prompt differently than the other prompt.
* Might be able to make decisions around how to respond to this question more quickly because it's based on his circumstances.

**4. Would you expect to see the same information, or different information, on the next page than you would for the "What benefits are you interested in?" prompt?**

* Same as for option 1.

# Participant 6

**Background**

* Veteran.
* Has used Vets.gov.

**1. What are your thoughts and impressions of "What benefits are you interested in?"**

* The options here seem pretty comprehensive.
* Would probably click "Read More" even though he's a veteran and already has a sense for what the different benefits are.
* Would feel comfortable interacting with this kind of question.

**2. What information would be helpful to see after you click "Submit?"**

* Information on the next page should be categorized by the benefits you've selected.
* Should have:
  * Summary of what the benefit is.
  * "Multiple links" — sounds like this would be information about the benefit.
* Also mentioned that it would be helpful to list VA benefits AND benefits offered by other agencies.
* Wants to see contact information for someone who can help.

**3. What are your thoughts and impressions of "Which of these circumstances apply to you?"**

* This prompt is more personable, "so that's good." Mentioned that this might be preferrable to some people but that others might feel like this is getting too personal. It might be especially concerning for people who don't want to discuss their disability or their healthcare needs.
* It would take longer to read this because there is more copy. Wouldn't mind this if he had more time but may not read it if he was in a rush.

**4. Would you expect to see the same information, or different information, on the next page than you would for the "What benefits are you interested in?" prompt?**

* May not check all the blocks, especially if he didn't want to talk to someone about how he had a disability or needed healthcare. Had said that he would have otherwised probably checked all boxes included in the first prompt because it wouldn't hurt to get information about everything.
* Would expect the same information after clicking "Continue" as he would for the first prompt, but would think the language following this would continue to be more personal.
