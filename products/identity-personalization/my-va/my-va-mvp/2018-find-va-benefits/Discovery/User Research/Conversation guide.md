## Intro (2 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Samara and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about [description of your project]. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** If you've had a frustrating experience or find something we show you to be confusing, we want to hear about it. Your honest insights help us to figure out how we can improve the veteran experience, and we will not be offended by any opinions you express.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

*Start recording.*

## Warm-up Questions (2 minutes)

Before we start, can you tell me a little bit about yourself? (If stuck, prompt to ask about service experience, where they live, their work)

## First Task: Interview about past experience finding benefits/determining eligibility (15 – 20 minutes)
 
First, what VA benefits do you currently have or have you used in the past?

***If they have VA benefits***

1. You mentioned you have [these benefits]. 
* (*if more than one benefit*) What was the first one that you applied for? Did you go through the application process for these all at once, or consecutively? Or, were some of these benefits you applied for months or years after [their first benefit]?
* (*if only one benefit*) When did you apply for [benefit]?

2. What motivated you to apply for these benefits? Was there a specific event, or different life events, that prompted you to apply?

3. How did you learn about these benefits?
* If anything, what could the VA have done to make it easier to learn that they offered these benefits?

4. How did you determine whether you were eligible for these benefits?
* If anything, what could the VA have done to make it easier to determine whether you were eligible for these benefits?

5. Have there ever been benefits you would have applied for sooner that you didn't apply for because you didn't know about them until later on?
* (*If yes*) How could the VA have helped you learn about these benefits sooner?

6. In addition to what we've already talked about, are there any other ways in the VA could make it easier to find what benefits they have and which benefits you might be eligible for?

***If they do not have VA benefits but plan to sign up for VA benefits***

1. Do you plan to apply for VA benefits? (*Note: Answer should be Yes based on recruiting requirements*)

2. What benefits have you thought about applying for? 

3. When did you decide you wanted to apply for [each benefit]? What circumstances have prompted you to think about applying for these benefits through the VA? Was there a specific event(s) that prompted this?

4. How did you learn about these benefits?
* If anything, what could the VA have done to make it easier to learn that they offered these benefits?

5. Have you tried to determine whether you were eligible for these benefits? If so, can you tell me about how you determined your eligibility?
* If anything, what could the VA have done to make it easier to determine whether you were eligible for these benefits?

6. Have there ever been benefits you would have applied for sooner that you didn't apply for because you didn't know about them until later on?
* (*If yes*) How could the VA have helped you learn about these benefits sooner?

7. In addition to what we've already talked about, are there any other ways in the VA could make it easier to find what benefits they have and which benefits you might be eligible for?

### Things to watch for:

- For participants who have applied for multiple benefits, do they tend to do this all at once or over years as their needs change?
- What motivates people to apply for benefits?
- In what ways can the VA improve how they elevate benefits?
- In what ways can the VA improve clarity on veteran eligibility?

## Second Task: ExploreVA (10 minutes)

Alright, next we're going to look at a site called ExploreVA. (**Link**: https://explore.va.gov) I'm going to share my screen with you and bring it up on my computer.

1. Have you ever used ExploreVA before?

ExploreVA is a website that can help you determine your eligibility for VA benefits. Today, we're going to take a brief walk through it. By clicking Get Started, you're taken to a page where the VA asks you some questions about your time in the military. 

(**Read the questions to the participant and have them answer them**)

The questionnaire is pretty long, so we're not going to go through it all today. Instead, I'm going to jump to the page that shows you what your results might look like based on the information you entered into this questionnaire.

Do you have any questions about what we just went over? 

(Go to link https://explore.va.gov/benefits-navigator-results/ArQkXHr66wmp)

Now we're on the results page. First, I want to confirm that you understand what we're looking at — can you tell me what you see here?

Great, now let's scan through the results and talk about them a little bit more:

1. Is this information provided on this page helpful or unhelpful in facilitating your understanding of these benefits? 
* (*Follow-up if necessary*) What questions, if any, do you have about these benefits that would be helpful to answer on this page?
2. What questions, if any, do you have about your eligibility for these benefits?
* Do you think this list encompasses everything you are eligible for?
3. Based on the wording on this page, do you think you are being guaranteed any of these benefits should you apply for them? 
4. Let's pretend you know that you want to take advantage of education benefits at some point in time, but you're not ready to apply right now. What would you do next?
5. In addition to what we've already talked about, are there any other ways in which this experience could be improved?

### Things to watch for:

- How much of an explanation do people need to understand their eligibilty?
- Do people feel this kind of a recommendation is a guarantee that they will receive the benefit?
- What do people want to do next?

## Third Task: Blue Sky Prototype (15 minutes)

Next, we're going to look at a potential future design for Vets.gov. Keep in mind this is not functionality that exists today. We've simply created these screens as an exploration and to ask you some questions today.

(Go to link https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/share/P2GB6ZNYTWE#/screens/284491935)

Today, we're going to imagine that we have signed in to Vets.gov for the first time. After signing in, we are taken to this screen. I want to ask you a few questions about this to see how you feel this compares to the other experience.

1. First, can you tell me what you are looking at here?
2. Do you understand how Vets.gov came up with these recommendations for you?
3. Do you trust these recommendations?
* (*If no*) Why not? How could we change this experience to help you trust these recommendations?
* Were you to receive these recommendations in real life, do you think these recommendations are more or less accurate than the ones you received from the questionnaire on ExploreVA, or do you think they would be equally as accurate?
4. What questions, if any, do you have about these benefits that would be helpful to answer on this page?
5. What questions, if any, do you have about your eligibility for these benefits?
* Do you think this list encompasses everything you are eligible for?
6. Let's assume you know you want at least one of these benefits — say, healthcare. How likely would you be to immediately apply for healthcare if you saw this recommendation in real life?
* (*if they would wait to apply*) Why would you wait?
* (*if they would wait to apply*) When would you apply? Would you find a reminder to apply helpful or unhelpful in the meantime?
* (*if they would wait to apply*) What would you want to do/expect to happen with this recommendation on your homepage?
7. Now let's pretend you know that you want to take advantage of education benefits at some point in time, but you're not ready to apply in the near term. 
* What would you want to do/expect to happen with this recommendation on your homepage?
* Would you want a reminder to come back to apply later?
8. Now let's consider the opposite — what would you do/expect to happen if there were benefits on this list that you had no interest in receiving? 
9. What would you do/expect to happen if you saw a benefit in this list that you already had?
10. In addition to what we've already talked about, are there any other ways in which this experience could be improved? 

### Things to watch for:

- Are participants thrown off by our brief explanations?
- Do they trust these results, or do they not trust them because they don't know how we got here?
- What next steps do they want to take?

## Thank-You and Closing - 1 minute

That's all I have for you today. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

As a thank you for your participation, we'd like to offer you a $50 gift either as an Amazon Gift Card or through Paypal. Do you have a preference?

Great, is it ok for us to send that gift to the same address we used to communicate with you about scheduling this test? 
[If no] Ok, we'll follow up with an email after this session to get the right email from you in writing.

Thanks! Lastly, would you like to share this feedback opportunity with other Veterans or Veteran groups you're a part of? If so, I can send you an email with a little blurb so you can easily connect folks to our team.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
