# Background

### [Research Plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Identity/Personalization/Recommendations/Discovery/User%20Research/Research%20plan.md)

### Goals

This research aimed to understand the following things:

* **Benefit discovery** — How do people discover benefits in real life, and how can we improve on this? What are the most effective ways to surface benefits, and when is the best time to surface them?
* **Facilitating user understanding** — Given that we are approaching benefit recommendations in a different way than what currently exists at the VA, what do veterans need in order to understand and trust recommendations?
* **Next steps** — After we tell a person they are eligible for something, what are some of the things they might want to do next?

## Interview

### Applying for benefits is not a one-and-done experience. 

All participants reported applying for different benefits over a number of years and months due to different life events or circumstances. Motivators to apply included incurring a disability during service, wanting VA healthcare, or planning to go back to school.

**Conclusion**: The goal of benefit recommendations should not be to get people to apply immediately, but to make sure they know what is available to them and what benefits include.

### Veterans primarily learn about benefits by word of mouth, or through TAP (disability).

This result isn't surprising — our team has heard through various research efforts that veterans report primarily learning about benefits from other veterans. 

A few people did mention learning about disability benefits through TAP. It's worth noting that all of the people interviewed left the service 10 – 15+ years ago, so TAP may have changed considerably since. 

Finally, a couple of people mentioned that GI benefits — education specifically – were part of what motivated them to go into the service in the first place, though it is unclear how easily they navigated these benefits when the time came to apply.

**Conclusion**: While there is certainly nothing wrong with people learning about benefits from other veterans, we don't want veterans to feel like this is the *only* source of information they can trust. This supports the overall value and direction of a benefits recommendation tool.

###  Lack of awareness is a major reason some veterans don't apply for certain benefits sooner.

While we only asked 4 participants about this, 3/4 participants reported that there were benefits they would have applied for sooner had they known about them. For all of them, this seemed to be a matter of years during which they went without a benefit/appropriate compensation because they didn't know what their options were. One participant told us a story about how she went **20 years at 10% disability compensation** before a friend suggested she apply for an upgrade. She is now compensated at **70%**.

**Conclusion**: This supports the overall value of a benefits recommendation tool. While there's nothing wrong with finding out about benefits through a fellow veteran, this isn't necessarily a timely or efficient process and can result in veterans going years without benefits they need, want, and deserve.

### Veterans weren't all that concerned about eligibility... until we asked them about it.

When participants were asked if they tried to determine their eligibiity for benefits before applying, most of the people we talked to said they didn't do much research specifically on eligibility. This seemed to be for a couple of reasons: first, some participants were sure they qualified for disabiity because they knew they'd incurred injuries while on active duty. Second, people also knew they were entitled to education beenfits as part of the GI bill. For other benefits, however, participants didn't seem to care much about eligibility **until** we started talking about it via ExploreVA and our recommendations prototype.

**Conclusion**: In some cases, eligibility information may cause more questions than it answers. We should be careful about how we elevate this information and question our assumptions about the importance veterans put on this metric before applying for benefits.

### Veterans want it to be simple and easy to learn about benefits.

This is a no brainer, but participants largely asked for simplicity and ease when asked at the end of the interview if there were any final thoughts they had about improving benefits discovery. Two participants even described wanting the exact functionality found on ExploreVA and in the benefits recommendation prototype prior to seeing either tool.

**Conclusion**: This supports the overall value and direction of a benefits recommendation tool. 

## ExploreVA and Benefits Recommendation Prototype

### Reception of ExploreVA was very positive.

People found ExploreVA straightforward, easy to use, and helpful in facilitating their understanding of benefits for which they may be eligible. Nobody seemed put off by having to answer questions about themselves; in fact, this helped people trust the results and understand where the results came from.

**Conclusion**: If we can't deduce everything about eligibility from data we have in the VA, it's OK to ask people some questions about themselves to round out the results.

### Reception of the benefits recommendation prototype was also very positive.

People felt postively about our design exploration as well. They understood what they were looking at, they liked how scannable it was, and they appreciated details we included like expiration dates or deadlines for certain benefits.

**Conclusion**: We're moving in the right direction!

### For both ExploreVA and the benefits recommendation prototype, people assumed the recommendations they were shown encompassed everything for which they were eligible.

Furthermore, they assumed that if something was not on this list, they were not eligible for it.

**Conclusion**: Since we will not be able to deduce eligibility with 100% accuracy, we need to be careful not imply that a list of benefits for which they may be eligible is the be-all-end-all. This is especially important for early versions of the benefits recommendation tool, which likely will not include all benefits.

### People do not assume they are being guaranteed benefits.

Thanks to the language on both ExploreVA and the benefits recommendation tool, mixed with the cautious skepticism most participants had for the VA, participants didn't feel that these recommendations were a guarantee of benefits.

**Conclusion**: Use language that communicates eligibility but does not imply benefits are guaranteed.

### For the benefits recommendation prototype, people generally understood that recommendations were based on data from the VA and DoD.

We were initially nervous that participants would be confused about where recommendations came from since they didn't have to answer any questions like they did on ExploreVA. However, most participants correctly guessed that recommendations were based on data the VA and DoD had about them.

**Conclusion**: Be transparent, but don't overexplain where data came from.

### Participants were somewhat more skeptical of the benefits recommendation prototype than they were ExploreVA.

Despite understanding how the benefits recommendation prototype worked — or perhaps because of it — participants reported a lower level of trust for our tool over ExploreVA. This seems to be a result of skepticism that has built up over time towards the VA as an institution rather than something about the interface participants were shown. People trusted the information they entered and results generated from that more than the data that the VA has about them.

**Conclusion**: To help build trust, be transparent about why we are telling someone they are eligible for a specific benefit.

### Most people do not want to apply for benefits immediately after seeing a recommendation.

For both ExploreVA and the benefits recommendation prototype, most people wanted to learn more and compare benefits before immediately applying.

**Conclusion**: "Learn More" should be the main CTA.

### Reminders would be helpful for benefits that people don't plan to apply for in the near future.

People said that reminders would be helpful if there was a benefit they knew they wanted — say, education — but wouldn't be ready to apply for in the near future.

**Conclusion**: Fully explore the utility of reminders to come back and apply.

### People want to remove or hide benefits they already receive or aren't interested in.

However, one participant mentioned he'd want a way to retrieve these recommendations later in case he changed his mind.

**Conclusion**: Keep the "I'm not interested" functionality, but consider whether it should be reversible.

### Some participants want to be able to investigate whether they are getting the highest level of compensation if they see a benefit in the list that they already receive.

Unfortunately, we don't have a way to get them a definitive answer on this or not, but we can be helpful in guiding them for benefits in which this scenario is possible (eg. disabiity benefits).

**Conclusion**: Where applicable, onsider how to guide people towards potentially applying for additional compensation if they already receive a benefit suggested to them.
