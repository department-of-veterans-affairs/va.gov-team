These are questions that we could not answer through analytics or internal research review.

## Questions to answer through research

Questions can be divided into three main categories:

* **Benefit discovery** — What are the most effective ways to surface benefits, and when is the best time to surface them?
* **Facilitating user understanding** — Given that we are approaching benefit recommendations in a different way than what currently exists at the VA, what do veterans need in order to understand and trust recommendations?
* **Next steps** — After we tell a person they are eligible for something, what are some of the things they might want to do next?

*Benefits discovery*

1. When do people go looking for benefits?

* **How we could answer this question**
  * Does VE have any insight into this? We should ask them.
  * Interview: Ask people.

2. What is the best way to surface recommendations?
* Is a dashboard widget (or something in-app) an effective way to reach people? 
* Would email/other notifications be an effective way to notify people, or would that create too much noise? 

* **How we could answer this question**
  * Interview: Ask people about how they found out about benefits, and how they would prefer to find out about benefits.

*Facilitating user understanding*

1. After we tell people they are eligible for something, what questions do they have? 

* **How we could answer this question**
  * User testing: Show them ExploreVA results and Vets.gov eliibility pages and ask what questions they have.

2. Will people trust us when we tell them they are eligible for something? What do they need to see to feel confident that our assessment of eligibility is accurate?
* And what might be "too much" information? Is there a sweet spot between explaining eligibility and information overload?

* **How we could answer this question**
  * User testing: Show them ExploreVA results and ask if they would have trusted if they hadn't gone through a quiz. Potentially show them a mockup and ask what information they would need to trust this.

3. Are people going to feel like we are guaranteeing them a benefit if we say they are eligible? 
  * What do we know about scenarios where someone maybe eligible for something but ultimately not get a benefit? Do those scenarios exist?
  
* **How we could answer this question**
  * User testing: Show them ExploreVA results/maybe a mockup and ask if they feel like this guarantees them benefits. 

*Next Steps*

1. What do people want to do next if we recommend them something they are interested in applying for in the near term?

* **How we could answer this question**
  * User testing: Show them ExploreVA results and ask what they would do next.

2. What do people want to do/expect to happen if they receive a recommendation that they are interested in but do not intend to apply for immediately?

* **How we could answer this question**
  * User testing: Show them ExploreVA results and ask about this scenario.

3. What do people want to do/expect to happen if we recommend something to them that the are already receiving?
*  Can we avoid recommending things to people they already have?

* **How we could answer this question**
  * User testing: Show them ExploreVA results and ask about this scenario.

4. What do people want to do/expect to happen if they are eligible for a benefit but are not interested in it (eg. healthcare — they may have private insurance they are happy with)?

* **How we could answer this question**
  * User testing: Show them ExploreVA results and ask about this scenario.
