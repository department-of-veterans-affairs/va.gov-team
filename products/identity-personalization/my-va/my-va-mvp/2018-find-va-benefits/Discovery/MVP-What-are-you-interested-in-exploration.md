# On personalization vs. customization

* [7 Tips for Successful Customization](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/customization/?lm=customization-personalization&pt=article)
* [Customization vs. Personalization in the User Experience](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/customization-personalization/)
* Asking people what they want more information on is customization, not personalization. Of course, it does contribute to an overall personal experience, so that feels like a win.
* People may not want to take the time to tweak their Vets.gov account to elevate benefit information, so we should plan for them not selecting any customized information as well

# User Cases

* We want to cater to people who are looking to **apply** for benefits. This means we need to make sure any sort of "what are you interested in?" questions are tailored specifically to the application process.
* We need to figure out what to do for people who don't select any customization.
* How is the experience different for people just leaving the service?
* How is the experience different for people who left the service a while ago?
* How is the experience different for people who have already interacted with the VA in some way?

# Questions

* What can we show people that is actually helpful to them to get them started? We already have a lot of great content that does its best to clarify the muddy waters of the VA. Is it helpful to elevate links to those pages, or is that just adding more noise?
* Are there 2 – 3 pieces of information we could elevate to someone's dashboard to help them get started with a specific benefit (eg. an expiration date for a benefit, or clarification on eligibility criteria that may otherwise be confusing)?
* Would a checklist of sorts be helpful? Is that the digital equivalent to a personal guide? Is that oversimplified?
* **Idea** — Do a chalkmark test where we show someone a screen shot of "What are you interested in?" and ask them what they would expect to happen next, and what would be helpful to see next.
* Some eligibility thoughts:
  * Would it be more helpful to embed eligibility questionaires on every eligibility page?
  * Could we send people to ExploreVA, have them take the questionnaire, and then import that information into Vets.gov / VA.gov?
