### To investigate

- How do we prioritize recommendations?
  - Which benefits and services deliver the most value to Veterans?
  - Which benefits and services are the most critical to those who need them?
  - Which benefits and services are tied to enrollment at certain times of the year (e.g. education) or seasons of life?
- How do Veterans determine whether they're eligible for a particular benefit? What difficulties do they have making this determination?
- Can we encourage people to apply for burial pre-need eligibility? A lot of people die before having filled this out. It helps the burial planning process go smoother for the surviving family members.

### UX considerations

- The next problem to bridge after solving for benefit discovery/eligibility is *convincing* Veterans to apply for a benefit. Reasons Veterans may not apply for a benefit they know about:
  - Don't think they need it
  - Think someone else deserves it more than them
  - Don't know how to apply
  - Not worth the hassle
- How do we make sure we aren't getting in the way of accomplishing a task? How do we share recommendations at the right time when a Veteran will be most receptive?

### Blue sky - what else might we solve with recommendations?

- Suggestions to help people better maintain their physical and mental health
  - Wellness checkups, mental health services, flu shots, etc
- Service-connected disabilities
  - Could we help them identify whether they have a SCD they weren't aware of? Short wizard, recommend a specific SCD, etc.
  - Could we help them identify if they have a SCD commonly associated with their service era?
  - Could we do a check-up on them to see if any of their SCDs have gotten worse and might make them eligible for an increase in compensation?
- Sub-benefits within a particular benefit area
  - 82% of Veterans in NVS survey indicated they don't know everything that's available to them through their health coverage
  - Many different types of life insurance, education/training benefits
