# Benefit recommendations internal research synthesis

See [original synthesis work](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Identity/Personalization/Discovery/Internal%20Research/Synthesis.md) from Q1 2018

## Findings from [partner and past internal research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Identity/Personalization/Discovery/Internal%20Research/Partner%20Research.md)

### Pain points

_What difficulties to Veterans have interacting with VA and their benefits?_

#### 1. Discovering benefits

> "A lot of the benefits are more for the younger guys just getting out. I'm not looking for a job, I have my medical benefits and they're pretty stationary."

Veterans...

- Don't absorb much information from TAP when transitioning from the military.
- Don't feel like they have much support transitioning from service, don't know where to start, and feel intimidated applying for benefits alone.
- Learn about benefits primarily by word of mouth, via VSOs or other Veterans.
- Assume they already have all the benefits they're eligible for and that there's nothing else for them.
- Assume benefits are for people other than them — if they're young, VA is for older Veterans. If they're older, VA is for those just getting out of service. If they're healthy, VA is for those with service-connected disabilities.
- Don't know where to start when it comes to VA, information is overwhelming and difficult to understand, hard to know what's relevant to them.

#### 2. Getting benefits

> "I think [getting help from a VSO] should be part of the standard process, if you go through eligibility or any other process"
> 
> "I would have to go through every single block and read it because I don’t want to pick the wrong thing. With the VA you have to be very specific and very precise on what you’re doing."

Veterans...

- Feel they need one-on-one assistance to get what they need from the VA
- Worry whether they’re doing things the exact "right way” in the VA’s eyes
- Worry they’re wasting their time on benefits they can’t get
- Worry they may be missing out on certain opportunities
- Feel there's a learning curve, that they need to build up experience dealing with VA
- Are unaware of important information that doesn’t surface until there is a [REAL, BIG problem](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Identity/Personalization/Discovery/Internal%20Research/Synthesis.md#lack-of-trust) or until it’s too late.
- Don’t know [why they can’t receive](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Identity/Personalization/Discovery/Internal%20Research/Synthesis.md#wait-why) certain benefits

## Opportunities

_What are Veterans' desired outcomes or improvements to address these pain points?_

### 1. Discovering benefits

Veterans want...

- A clearer picture of what's available and relevant to them personally through VA
- More support from the VA when transitioning from service
- The VA to meet them where they are, not the other way around

### 2. Getting benefits

Veterans want...

- To feel confident working with VA
- Reassurance they're doing everything right and are on the right track
- A personal touch that feels catered to their unique situation
- Want to find and manage [everything in one place](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Identity/Personalization/Discovery/Internal%20Research/Synthesis.md#keep-it-together)
- Want help finding NEW opportunities (e.g., jobs)

## Concepts

_How could we deliver an experience that addresses what Veterans want and solves their pain points?_

### 1. Discovering benefits - Learn about Benefits

Veterans will be able to...

- Onboard to the VA with a digital transition program (see [AFT quotable](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Identity/Personalization/Discovery/Internal%20Research/Synthesis.md#air-force-transition))
- See personalized recommendations for benefits they may be eligible for, unaware of, or are otherwise relevant to them, based on service, rating, family details, life goals
- Use medical history to predict future health problems, provide suggestions and resources

### 2. Getting benefits - Apply for Benefits

Veterans will be able to...

- See clear, outlined, actionable steps to apply for eligible benefits
- Checklist of documents/information needed not already in their online records

## Findings from recent 526 discovery sprint on disability benefits

### Which benefits do Veterans most often know about vs. don't?

- Veterans either didn't know they were eligible for disability claims, they didn't know all the stuff they could claim, they didn't know all of the associated things they could claim, and/or they didn't understand the process of applying for claims.
- Veterans depend on other veterans, either friends or on the internet, for information. The information that they get through the VA isn't helpful or easy to understand, it doesn't seem useful to their specific situation and it doesn't guide them through the process.
- VSOs are hit or miss. The quality, training and service of a VSO can be great, it could be terrible. It really depends on the VSO.

#### In the process of researching eligibility and paperwork requirements, Veterans feel:

> "Everything in the military is figure it out on your own unless you find someone who's done it before and who cares about you."

> "I don't know what to do next or how to figure it out so I'll just go to DAV and they'll help me."

> “I don't know what I'm entitled to. Do I fit into that criteria? I don't know just by reading.”

> "I would like to know from the source — I want to learn from VA — I want clear language when getting ready to apply."

> "Am I taking valuable resources from 'more deserving' fellow Veterans?"

#### In the process of researching eligibility and paperwork requirements, VSOs feel:

> "The VA has great specialized programs for things like blindness and spinal cord injuries, but it's really hard finding out about them. Once you are in the program it's great."

> "There are so many questions Veterans have about their benefits."

> "Younger Veterans don't file clams when they transition out of the military because they don't want to be considered a ‘disabled Veteran’."
