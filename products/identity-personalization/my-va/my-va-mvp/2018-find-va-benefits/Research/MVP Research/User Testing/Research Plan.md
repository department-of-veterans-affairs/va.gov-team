# Research Plan for Benefits Recommendation MVP User Testing

## Goals
**1. What product & team are you doing this research for?**

* Dragons/Personalization.

**2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product?**

For full details, see the [MVP Product Outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Identity/Personalization/Recommendations/MVP%20Product%20Outline.md). Summary:

* We are designing and preparing to test the MVP for benefit recommendations. Our mechanism for making recommendations is to ask users what they're interested in learning about, and then to surface resources to help them apply for benefits based on the areas in which they've indicated interest.

**3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research?**

* **Flow** — Does the overall flow make sense, feel intuitive, and meet user expectations to both new users of Vets.gov and existing users of Vets.gov?
* **Dashboard utility** — Do users report that the approach we've taken with the dashboard is a helpful/useful way to surface content?
* **Interactions** — Which interactions feel intuitive? Which interactions feel confusing?
* **Areas for improvement** — How could we make this product easier to use, more intuitive, and more valuable to users?

**4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research?** 

Hypotheses:

* The overall flow will make sense to users.
* Users will be excited by additional personalization in Vets.gov.
* Users will find the information we put on the dashboard to be helpful in guiding them on how to apply for benefits.
* There will be unforeseen areas for improvement that will come to light during user testing.

## Method

**1.	What method of research are you planning?** 

* Remote, moderated user testing.
  
**2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions?** 

* We'll be able to see how people use our designs and ask them questions as they walk through it. This will allow us to evaluate flow, interaction design, and have a discussion around expectations, needs, and improvements.

**3.	Where are you planning to do your research?** 

* Remotely via GoToMeeting.

**4.	What will you be testing?**

* InVision prototype.

## Participants and Recruitment

**1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?**

I am looking for **7 people** who meet the following criteria:

* Veterans who have interest in applying for at least one benefit in the next couple of years.
* At least two veterans who are 35 years old or less. This could also be a service member who is getting ready to offboard or has recently offboarded.
* At least one woman.
* At least one person of color.
* 2 – 3 veterans or service members who do not have a Vets.gov account.
* 2 – 3 veterans who have a Vets.gov account and report using it about 1 – 2X a month.
* All participants need to have access to a computer during the research session. They can NOT use a mobile phone as their computer screen.

**2.	What is your recruitment strategy?** 

* Will work with Brian from Perigean.

## When? 

**1.	Timeline: When are you hoping this research will happen?** 

* Week of September 3.

**2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready?**

* Prototype will be ready no later than the Friday before testing.

**3. Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times. Please request enough dates and time slots. Be as flexible as possible, cognizant that many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.**

* Tuesday – Friday, 8 am – 5 pm.

**4.	Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with?**
