## Intro (2 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Samara and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about finding and applying for benefits. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** If you've had a frustrating experience or find something we show you to be confusing, we want to hear about it. Your honest insights help us to figure out how we can improve the veteran experience, and we will not be offended by any opinions you express.
- **In this session, we will be looking at a prototype.** This means that we are looking at something that looks like a real website, but it functions a bit differently. For example, some links will work while other links won't. This is for the purpose of testing so we can focus on observing specific tasks. Do you have any questions about this or what a prototype is? 
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

*Start recording.*

## Warm-up Questions (2 minutes)

1. Before we start, can you tell me a little bit about yourself? (If stuck, prompt to ask about service experience, where they live, their work).
2. Do you have a Vets.gov account? If so, about how often do you use the website?

## First Task: Find VA Benefits Page.

### [Prototype link](https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/share/42NVD9C6T35#/screens/317374844_01-Home-Desktop)

### Participants who do not have a Vets.gov account (~2 minutes)

Ok, we're going to imagine you are signing in to Vets.gov for the first time. You can click Sign In for me.

Since you can sign in to Vets.gov with an existing account, let's pretend you are going to sign in through DS Logon. Go ahead and click Sign in with DS Logon. Since this is a prototype and not your actual account, we've put in a mock email address here, and you'll see mock data in the prototype that is different from the data in your real account. Do you have any questions about that?

(Participant signs in — Jump to [Find VA Benefits questions](#find-va-benefits-questions))

### Participants who DO have a Vets.gov account (~5 minutes)

Ok, we're going to sign into Vets.gov today in this prototype. Click sign in for me.

Today, we're going to sign in through MyHealtheVet, so you can go ahead and click that for me. Since this is a prototype and not your actual account, we've put in a mock email address here, and you'll see mock data in the prototype that is different from the data in your real account. Do you have any questions about that?

OK, you can continue signing in.

Now you are on your homepage. I'd like to draw your attention to the Find VA Benefits section at the top of this page:

1. What do you think this section might do?
2. What do you think will happen when you click "Select benefits you'd like to learn about"?
  * (If not answered) What will you see on that page?
3. If you were to see this in real life, under what circumstances would you be interested in clicking "Select benefits you'd like to learn about" and using the Find VA Benefits tool?

OK, you can click "Select benefits you'd like to learn about" now.

### Find VA Benefits Questions

First, take a look at this page and tell me what you see here.

 **Participants signing up for the first time only (~1 minute)** 
 
1. Why do you think you were taken here after you signed in?
2. Does it feel intuitive or unintuitive that you were taken here after you signed in? Why?

**All participants (~8 minutes)** 

1. Take your time to look through this page, and then tell me — what do you think the purpose of this page is?
2. The directions say "Tell us which benefits you're interested in, so we can help you apply. Select one or more of the types of benefits below, and we'll help you get started." What do you think this means? How do you think we'll help you "get started"?
3. How would you select benefits you're interested in?
  * (if it's unclear whether they understand multiselect) How many benefits do you think you can select?
  * (if they don't click anything) Please select healthcare.
  * OK, please also select disability and then education and training.
4. I'd like you to take a scan through the options on this page. Do you feel like the options we've listed here:
  * Cover circumstances that feel personally relevant to you currently? **and/or**
  * Cover circumstances that have been personally relevant/important to you in the past?
  * Is there anything that is important to you that you'd expect to see here but don't?
5. Without clicking anything, what do you think will happen when you click Save Preferences?
6. Without clicking anything, what do you think will happen if you click Cancel?

Before we continue:

1. How can this page be improved?
2. What about this page worked well?

OK, now please click Save Preferences.

### Things to watch for:

- Do new users understand why they were taken to this page as the first thing they see in their account?
- Do existing users understand what the empty Find A Benefits section is on their dashboard? Do they have interest in interacting with it?
- Are there any glaring points of confusion with the overall design of this page?

## Second Task: Dashboard (~8 minutes)

Alright, now we are on your homepage. 

1. Take a look at the Find VA Benefits section. Is this what you expected to see after clicking Save Preferences?
  * (If no) How does this differ from what you expected to see?
2. You can see that we've opened the top block — Healthcare — but Disability Compensation and Education and Training are closed right now. Why do you think that is? Would you prefer to see a different presentation — like all blocks open or closed — when you come to your homepage?  
3. Take a look at the Healthcare block:
  * Is this content helpful or unhelpful in guiding you on how to apply? Why or why not?
4. How would you open the Disability Compensation content? How would you close it?
  * Is this content helpful or unhelpful in guiding you on how to apply? Why or why not?
5. Now please open Education and Training for me. Is this content helpful or unhelpful in guiding you on how to apply? Why or why not?
6. How would you remove Education and Training from the homepage?
7. How would you add Education and Training back to your homepage?
8. In real life, what might cause you to add or remove a block from the Find VA Benefits section of your homepage?
9. Now let's assume you clicked "Apply?" What do you think would happen next?
  * (If not clear) Do you think this block on the homepage would change or stay the same after you started an application?

Before we continue:

1. How can this page be improved?
2. What about this page worked well?

### Things to watch for:

- Is this content helpful to get them started? Did we pull out the right kind of content?
- Do they know how to add and remove modules?
- Are there any glaring points of confusion with the overall design of this page?

## Third Task: Wrap-up questions (~8 minutes)

Now I want to ask you some questions about the overall experience we just went through today:

1. Do you think this is a helpful or unhelpful approach to help people get started learning about or applying for VA benefits? Why?
  * (for veterans who already have benefits) Do you think this tool would have been helpful or not to you in the past when you were trying to learn about and apply for benefits?
2. In what ways can we better surface benefits so they are easier for veterans and service members to find and understand? This could be on this website or offline.
3. In what ways can we better help people through the application process? This could be on this website or offline.
4. Would you recommend or not recommend the experience we just looked at to a fellow veteran to help them apply for or explore a benefit they are interested in?

## Thank-You and Closing - 1 minute

That's all I have for you today. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

As a thank you, we'll be sending you a $50 check for your participation today. This check will take about 1 – 2 weeks to get to you, and it will be from the organization that Brian — who recruited you - works for. If you do not get the check in 1 – 2 weeks, please get in touch with us. Do you have any questions about this?

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
