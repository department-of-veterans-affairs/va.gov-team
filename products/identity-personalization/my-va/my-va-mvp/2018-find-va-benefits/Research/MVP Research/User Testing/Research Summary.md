### Goals & What We Did

We tested [this prototype](https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/share/42NVD9C6T35#/screens/317374844_01-Home-Desktop) which is our team's first attempt at benefit recommendations. In this flow, users are asked what benefits they would like to learn more about, and then they are presented with guidance on how to apply for those benefits. Our research aimed to evaluate the following elements of the experience:

* **Flow** — Does the overall flow make sense, feel intuitive, and meet user expectations to both new users of Vets.gov and existing users of Vets.gov?
* **Dashboard utility** — Do users report that the approach we've taken with the dashboard is a helpful/useful way to surface content?
* **Interactions** — Which interactions feel intuitive? Which interactions feel confusing?
* **Areas for improvement** — How could we make this product easier to use, more intuitive, and more valuable to users?

# Methods

### Dates

This research took place between **September 4 – 5, 2018**.

### Participants

We talked to **six participants**:

* Five men, one woman.
* One participant identified as black, one as hispanic, and one as multi-ethnic. The other three participants identified as white.
* We had one participant under the age of 30. All other participants ranged from 48 – 70.
* Four participants receive disability compensation.

## Insights

### Overall, this tool tested well and was perceived as helpful by participants.

All participants said they felt that the Find VA Benefits tool was helpful, and that they wished they had access to this tool when they were applying for benefits in the past. All participants said they would recommend this tool to other veterans.

*"Oh if you had this up and running right now — and I get many questions about this — I would just forward the link to my friends."* – Participant 5

**Conclusion**: We are moving in the right direction with the MVP for benefit recommendations.

### "Cancel" button on the Find VA Benefits page caused confusion for all participants.

[Find VA Benefits page](https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/share/42NVD9C6T35#/screens/317374850)

4/6 participants had some level of confusion when asked to predict what would happen if they clicked "Cancel" from the Find VA Benefits page.

The problem here is two-fold: First, we proposed a different flow for first time users and existing users. For first time users, we dropped them on the Find VA Benefits page after logging in, which naturally sets the expectation that cancel will take them to the page they saw before, ie. the logged out homepage.

For existing users, we had them log in, showed them their homepage, and then prompted the to the Find VA Benefits page from here. Some participants understood Cancel would go back to their homepage, but others thought cancel would clear their selections but ultimately leave them on the Find VA Benefits page.

**Recommendation**: On the Find VA Benefits page, consider updating the "Cancel" button to clarify what happens next.

### Most participants preferred to see all "Find VA Benefits" blocks open on the dashboard.

Our initial proposal for the Find VA Benefits block was to show one benefit module open with the rest closed as a default state. This design aimed to reduce the vertical height of this section and avoid important content being pushed too far down the page.

However, most participants wanted to see the Find VA Benefits information opened by default and didn't like that we forced them to manually open these modules. A couple of people even missed the second and third benefit modules in the section because they were collapsed and because they said the gray block used in the collapsed state was hard to see.

**Conclusion**: Consider how we can meet user expectations here without making the Find VA Benefits section too long by defaulting to having all blocks in this section open.

### Participants could not figure out how to remove benefit blocks from their homepage without prompting.

While most participant were successfully able to articulate what needed to happen in order to remove a benefit block from the Find VA Benefits section — go back to the page where they initially selected what benefits they wanted to learn more about and deselect them — most participants could not find the link that allowed them to do this. This is likely because this link sits at the top of the FInd VA Benefits section of the dashboard, and it is not visible if you are scrolled down the page.

**Recommendation**: Add a "Remove" link to each benefit block so that it is easier to find.

### Participants assume that the Find VA Benefits blocks on the homepage will change after they start or submit an application.

Participants assume the benefit blocks will change to show they are in the process of filling out an application, or to show that they have filled one out. While this was intentionally left out of the MVP for simplicity purposes, we anticipate integrating the Find VA Benefits tool more closely with the Continue Applications tool in a V2 of the dashboard.

**Recommendation**: More closely integrate the Find VA Benefits and Continue Applications tools in a V2 of the dashboard.
