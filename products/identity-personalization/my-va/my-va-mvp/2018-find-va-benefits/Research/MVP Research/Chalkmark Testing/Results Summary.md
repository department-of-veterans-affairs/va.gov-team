# Background

### Goals

This research aimed to evaluate the initial copy written for the [Find VA Benefits](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/issues/12461) page to determine whether the way we were describing benefits on this page matched users' mental models of how they think about their own circumstances.

# Methods

### Dates

This research took place between **August 21 – 27, 2018**.

### Participants

* 128 (57%) people completed our study. 
  * 223 participants started and 95 abandoned.
* The average time to complete the survey was just under 6 minutes.

### What We Did

We launched a Chalkmark test that asked 19 questions about the [Find VA Benefits](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/issues/12461) page. All questions followed the format, "What would you click if you were looking for [X]?", and were presented in a randomized order.
