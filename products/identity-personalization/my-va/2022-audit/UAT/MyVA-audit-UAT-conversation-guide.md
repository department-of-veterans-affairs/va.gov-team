## Starting the session

- _When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro._

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Angela. Today we're going to be reviewing a specific page of VA.gov that helps Veterans get personalized updates, action items, and resources.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **I have a few other colleagues in the waiting room who would like to observe and take notes.** Are you okay with letting them in for this session?
	- _If participant does not consent, ask the observers to kindly leave the Zoom via Slack._
	- _If participant consents, let other observers in and allow a short pause to say hello._ Here are some other members from our website team - if you'd all like to say a quick hello. And now for those of you who just joined, if you could please turn off your cameras to save bandwidth, that would be great.
- **This entire session should take no longer than 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you any longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic to keep us on schedule.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability; we are testing our work so you cannot do anything wrong here. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. As you go through the site, it'll be really helpful if you can think out loud as much as possible.
- **We will be looking at your real account info in VA.gov today.** This means we will be able to see some of your personal information. If at any point you are uncomfortable, feel free to stop sharing your screen.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly and I will pause the recording while you are signing in so we don't capture any of that info.
  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## 1: Confirm they qualify for the study; Discuss what kind of VA benefits they use and how they currently manage them. - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, I'd like to get a little background information from you:

- Can you tell me what benefits you currently have through VA?

- Do you currently use any online tools to manage your VA benefits?

- Let's talk about the website - do you use VA.gov at all? If so, what do you use it for?

- Do you know your username and password to log in to VA.gov?
	- *If the user cannot remember or retrieve their login credentials, **end the session.*** Without login credentials, we aren't able to test this feature with you today so I'm going to end the call. Thank you so much for your willingness to participate; it is greatly appreciated.

	- Okay, great. Please open a new tab in your chosen browser and go to VA.gov. Once you're there and before you log in, please share your screen with me. Let me know if you need any help doing that. 

	- *Once they are sharing their screen* Okay great, thank you! I'm going to pause the recording while you log in. *Pause the recordinng* You can go ahead and log in now.

	- *Once they are past the login screen, restart the recording.*

## 2. Is the dynamic content on My VA accurate and useful in the sections we've updated for this audit? - 5 minutes

- Does this information look accurate to your current benefits situation? Is there anything you're surprised to see or expecting to see that you don't?
- You said you go online to check X. Can you tell me how you'd go about doing/looking into that from here?

- [ ] **UAT TASK:** Confirm that all sections are showing for the user and the dynamic content seems to line up with their expectations of their current benefits situation.
- [ ] **Usability**: Confirm that users are able to find relevant benefit info and act on it if applicable.


## 3. Do Veterans with education benefits know how to find info about their remaining education benefits from My VA? - 3 minutes
P2, P3, P4, P6

*Skip this section if they have never used education benefits*

- You said you have education benefits through VA (or have in the past). How do you think you could go about finding information on this page about your remaining benefits?
- Is the term "Post-9/11 GI bill" familiar to you?

- [ ] **UAT TASK:** Confirm that Veterans who are familiar with education benefits find the links useful in the Education and training section and know that the third link is where they could find out about their remaining benefits.
- [ ] **Usability**: Confirm that Veterans are familiar with the term "Post-9/11 GI Bill."

## 4. Do Veterans know how to find and continue a saved application from My VA? - 3 minutes

- Let's scroll down to the Benefit application drafts section. What do you think this section is for?
- If you filled out an application for benefits and submitted it to VA, would you expect to see that application here or somewhere else?

- [ ] **UAT TASK:** Determine whether the title of the section has made it more clear that the section is for benefit applications that have been started but not submitted.

## 5. Confirm links - 15 minutes
*There are many links on the page so I'll make sure they are all clicked by at least one user but am more concerned with data being pulled correctly, so I'll likely ask users to click on links where I want to see if the dynamic content on My VA matches the page it takes them to.*

- Now lastly, I want to make sure the links on this page are functioning as expected so I'll have you click on some of them.
  - *Select some links to test; prioritizing ones that have dynamic content we want to verify the accuracy of.*

## Post-Task Interview - 3 minutes
- Thank you so much! That concludes our session for today. This has been so helpful for our team. Do you have any feedback on what we looked at in this session or questions for me?

## Thank-You and Closing - 1 minute
- Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to test these updates today. This helps us to make sure everything will work when we launch these updates for all veterans on VA.gov.  I hope you enjoy the rest of your day!
