| [Content](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/48624#event-7654859360)      |  1. [LOA1 state](https://www.figma.com/file/15yOY4VEzitxm5tRMDiAzz/My-VA?type=design&node-id=0%3A239&mode=design&t=ACz9YR6bpwDeZvbB-1) I recommend using an em dash as opposed to a plain dash.  VA Guidance with regard to punctuation can be found [here](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/punctuation#em-and-en-dashes-hyphensurl).<br /> 2. Recommend using "We need to make sure you're you—and not someone pretending to be you—before we can give you access to your personal and health-related information.", as opposed to, "We need to make sure you're you - and not someone pretending to be you - before we can give you access to your personal and health-related information." <br /> 3. According to AP Stylebook, 56th edition, an em dash is used to signal abrupt change within a phrase. <br />  4. [Error states](https://www.figma.com/file/15yOY4VEzitxm5tRMDiAzz/My-VA?type=design&node-id=0%3A266&mode=design&t=ZhUs1Oeae2EQjVFh-1) With regard to verbiage, in order to be consistent with the Health care section, Claims and appeals should read, "We can't access **your** claims or appeals information right now."  The Health care section reads, "We can't access your appointment information."  This is in accordance with the [VA plain language standards](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/content-principles/plain-language). [Error states](https://www.figma.com/file/15yOY4VEzitxm5tRMDiAzz/My-VA?type=design&node-id=0%3A266&mode=design&t=ACz9YR6bpwDeZvbB-1) With regard to verbiage, in order to be consistent with the Claims and appeals section, Health care section should read, "We can't access your appointment information **right now**."   | None   | None  |  [#48701](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/48701), [#48705](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/48705), [#48704](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/48704), [#48706](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/48706)  |
| [IA](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/48667#event-7657120227) | None | 1. Some sections have “Manage your _____” embedded in the card template, but other sections have it sitting outside the card (also varies on Desktop whether it is in the right vs. left column). Use fixed logic around what appears where, so that the IA experience is consistent across all sections.<br /> 2. Move “What benefits does VA offer” external link from under the “Saved applications” area - this is unrelated. Work with site-wide content & IA to find a page location that is a better fit. <br /> 3. In [this sketch file](https://www.com/s/9b0e6efc-423a-4354-9db3-ab2083d566c9/a/9P240Kn) showing loading problems on MyVA Page, we send people externally to My HealtheVet. Ensure users will be able to navigate back to MyVA. | 1. Authenticated users see “Saved applications” as H1 section header. For the same section, unauthenticated users see “Apply for VA benefits.” Since we are saving in-progress forms for unauthenticated users, can we use the same language across both? | [#48709](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/48709), [#48710](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/48710)  | 
| [Accessibility](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/48676#event-7657400767) | None | None | None | None | 
| [QA](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/48677) | None | 1. We recommend using TestRail for tracking manual testing of your feature. You can use TestRail's reference field to link directly to tickets stored in GitHub. By default TestRail references va.gov-team repo issues. If you create va.gov-team tickets for your user stories then you can march them through the project management workflow of GitHub/ZenHub AND you can provide excellent reference material for the test cases that verify the stories are completed to satisfaction. If you do not have a TestRail account, please reach out to the Governance team so that one can be created for you. <br />  2. Read through our [TestRail guides](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/testrail-guide). | None | None  | 
| [Design](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/48655)   | 1. The green alert and button are reserved for login in only. Change the button to the [primary button](https://design.va.gov/components/button/#primary-button) or if that behaves as navigation, an [action link](https://design.va.gov/components/link/action). <br />  2. "What benefits does VA offer?" additional info - it's not a Saved application. Work with IA and find a better home for it on the error state and authenticated state. <br /> 3. "Education and training" has no "You have no education benefits" state like all of the other sections. It should have that and put the links on the right like the other sections. <br /> 4. In the error state and in the "You have nothing to show" state the links all slide under the Alerts or under the message. They should stay to the right. No reason to move them. It makes it harder to spot those messages and there is no technical reason that can't be achieved (use the grid correctly). | 1. Use the new notification style card instead of alert styling for things like "You have 2 unread messages". It is approved and in the backlog to be added to the DS. : )    | None  | Must: [#48712](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/48712) , [#48713](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/48713) , [#48714](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/48714) , [#48716](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/48716) , [#48717](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/48717) Should: [#48718](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/48718) , [#48719](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/48719) , [#48725](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/48725) , [#48726](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/48726) |
