# Conversation Guide for Authenticated Experience team - My VA Audit Improvements

- [ ] Make sure the feature flipper is turned on for the participant before the session
- [ ] Start a thread in feedback backchannel with a link to observations document and observer instructions
- [ ] Turn on closed captioning in order to use Zoom transcription

## Starting the session
- _Keep observers in waiting room to ask participant if they still consent to having observers in the session. Tell them to have their camera on with full name displayed for a brief introduction to participant when they are admitted to the session._
- _Check your screensharing setup and share permissions for participants._
- _When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro._

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Angela. Today we're going to be reviewing a specific page of VA.gov that helps veterans get personalized updates, action items, and resources.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **I have a few other colleagues in the waiting room who would like to observe and take notes.** Are you okay with letting them in for this session?
	- _If participant does not consent, ask the observers to kindly leave the Zoom via Slack._
	- _If participant consents, let other observers into room and allow a short pause to say hello._ Here are some other members from our website team - if you'd all like to say a quick hello. And now for those of you who just joined, if you could please turn off your cameras to save bandwidth, that would be great.
- **This entire session should take no longer than 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you any longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic to keep us on schedule.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability; we are testing our work so you cannot do anything wrong here. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. As you go through the site, it'll be really helpful if you can think out loud as much as possible.
- **We will be looking at your real account info in VA.gov today.** This means we will be able to see some of your personal information. If at any point you are uncomfortable, feel free to stop sharing your screen.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly and I will pause the recording while you are signing in so we don't capture any of that info.
  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Task goal: Confirm they qualify for the study, learn what they use VA.gov for if at all, and how it's meeting their needs as of now. - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, I'd like to get a little background information from you:

1. First, can you tell me what benefits you currently have through VA, if any?
  
2. What online or manual tools do you currently use to manage these benefits? *(VA.gov, MHV, eBenefits, phone, email, etc.)* Which of these tools or methods is the most useful to you and why?

3. Let's talk about the website - how do you use VA.gov? *If they use it:* Do you ever visit My VA when you are logged in?

## Task goal: Determine if the updated information architecture of My VA still aligns with Veterans' mental model. - 10-15 minutes

Now I'm going to ask you to open a new tab in your chosen browser and go to VA.gov. Once you're there and before you log in, please share your screen with me. Let me know if you need any help doing that. 

*Once they are sharing their screen* Okay great, thank you! I'm going to pause the recording while you log in. *Pause the recordinng* You can go ahead and log in now.

*Once they are past the login screen, restart the recording.*

- Okay so I'm going to ask you to think out loud while the next page loads. Any thoughts you're having would be helpful to hear.
- *Once the full page has loaded* You said you go online to check X. Tell me how you'd go about doing/looking into X from here.
- *If they mention education benefits in the intro questions* Let's scroll down to the education and training section. Are any of the links in this section of interest to you? Is there anything else about education benefits that you would want to look up that you're not seeing here?
- *If the user has had debt in the past or currently has debt, ask:* Taking a look at the outstanding debts section here, take a moment to review what it says. Would you expect to see a link to your past debt letters here? Is that something you might reference once a debt is paid off?
- Let's scroll down to the saved applications section. What do you think this section is for? What does "saved applications" mean to you?
- If you filled out an application and submitted it to VA, would you expect to see that application here or somewhere else?

### Things to watch for:

- Are certain sections taking a long time to load? How do veterans react to loading times? If there are any errors, how do veterans react to those?
- Are veterans able to find their top tasks easily? Can they act on them or get the info they're interested in?
- Is there anything veterans are looking for specifically that's not on My VA?
- How do veterans who use education benefits react to the education section? What about veterans who do not use education benefits, and those who are not interested?
- Is it clear that saved applications have not been submitted or do we need additional context or content changes in this section to convey that?

## Task goal: Determine if showing all sections all the time on My VA has made the page more, less, or equally usable compared to its current state. - 10 minutes

- Let's take a look at a section that's empty. *Have them scroll to a section that doesn't apply to them*
- What do you think about seeing this section when you log in even though it doesn't apply to you?
- Are there any VA benefits you're not currently using that you might be interested in? *If yes* How would you find information about those benefits?
- *For users who have empty sections* Now let's click the link under this empty section and take a look at the page it takes you to. If this what you would expect? Do you want to know additional information before taking action? What additional information would you be looking for?
- Is there anything you're expecting to see on My VA that you don't see?

### Things to watch for:

- How do veterans react to seeing empty sections on My VA? 
- Are empty sections getting in the way of veterans finding what they would come to VA.gov to do?
- Are the CTA links bringing attention to benefits that veterans might be interested in?
- Are the pages we're linking to from My VA's empty sections useful to veterans?
- Are there any top tasks still missing from My VA?

## Post Task Interview - 3 minutes

Now that we've walked through this page a bit, let's talk about your thoughts on the overall experience.

1. How important is the information that we looked at today to you?
2. What did you expect to see that you didn't?
3. Was there anything we looked at on My VA today that you didn't want or need to see on that page?
4. If you could change one thing about the page we just looked at together, what would it be?

## Thanks and Closing - 2 minutes

Great, thank you so much. This has been really helpful for our team, and we appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. 

Do you know of any other veterans who might be interested in signing up to participate in research studies like this?
*If yes* Great, then I will have someone email you a link to share with them so they can sign up too.

Do you have any questions or last thoughts for me before we end the session?

Thank you for your feedback and thank you so much again for joining us today. We really appreciate it.
