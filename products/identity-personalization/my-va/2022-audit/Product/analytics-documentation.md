### Dec 7, 2022 Mtg Notes

- We've decided that for this initial analytics request we will submit a request only for new analytics to be implemented, i.e. any new links that were added from the audit. 
- In the future we can submit a request to update any naming/updating of GA events for consistency and accuracy.
