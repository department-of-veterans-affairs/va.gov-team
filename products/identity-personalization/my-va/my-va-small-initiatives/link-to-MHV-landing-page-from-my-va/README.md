## Overview
The health wayfinding study from earlier in 2023 showed that some folks had a hard time finding/navigating to the new MHV landing page from My VA, and therefore had a hard time finding additional health information not shown on My VA.

We'll be adding some form of a "view all" link (content and mechanism tbd) to the Health Care section on My VA which will navigate users to the new MHV landing page on va.gov. We'll also be exploring this concept of "view all/more" acroess the other benefits on My VA to make sure we are making the experience as consistent as possible. 

Specifically for the health care section, once we add this link, we'll monitor the existing secondary links we currently display on My VA to see if engagement on those declines. This would indicate that they aren't needed and users are finding what they need from the link that navigates them to the MHV landing page.
