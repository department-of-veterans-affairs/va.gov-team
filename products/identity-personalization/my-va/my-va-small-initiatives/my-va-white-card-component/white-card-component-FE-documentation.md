- [Desktop](https://www.sketch.com/s/9b0e6efc-423a-4354-9db3-ab2083d566c9/a/rb3RzvK)
- [Mobile](https://www.sketch.com/s/9b0e6efc-423a-4354-9db3-ab2083d566c9/a/m1Q51yV)

**Visual specs**

- Use the [white outline default style of the card component](https://design.va.gov/storybook/?path=/docs/components-va-card--default) in the VA design system **without** a drop shadow.

#### **Content**

All content, text styling, link styling, and spacing should remain the same as it is in the gray cards.

**Positioning**

Nothing should change about the positioning of the cards and/or the logic for when they show as it currently is with the gray card style. The only change should be the style of the cards.
