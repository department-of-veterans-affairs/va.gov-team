## UX Specs
### Identity verification call-to-action

**Visual specs**

- Use the [sign in or tool prompt component](https://design.va.gov/storybook/?path=/docs/components-va-alert--default#sign-in-or-tool-prompt) in the VA design system.
- The link to verify your identity should use the [primary action link style](https://design.va.gov/components/link/action#primary) in the VA design system.

**Positioning**

- This call-to-action should appear at the top of the page after the profile link.

Verify your identity to access more VA.gov tools and features

We need to make sure you’re you—and not someone pretending to be you—before we can give you access to your personal and health-related information. This helps to keep your information safe, and to prevent fraud and identity theft.

This one-time process takes about 5-10 minutes.

## Error States

- The data for saved applications is gathered from the same API as the main user call. Therefore, there are no errors specific to just this section. If the main user call fails, the entire My VA page displays an error.
