## Overview
Now that the streamlined UX experience has been released to users for some time we want to make some updates to the LOA1 experience to be more consistent with LOA3.

We will be updating the LOA1 state to have 5 sections instead of the existing 2:
1. Verify your identity 
2. Claims and appeals
3. Health care
4. Education
5. Benefit application drafts


## Key Dates

- August 2023: Development
- October 2023: Release
