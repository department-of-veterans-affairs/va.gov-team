## Troubleshooting

### Errors and Metrics
The section is tied to the main user id call. If the call fails, the entire My VA page will fail and the user will see a standard full page message indicating that the page is down. Other errors may occur on the page due to issues connecting to various upstream APIs, such as claims, debts or payments API. Users will see an error message within the corresponding benefit section letting them know there is a problem. 

### Issue investigation steps
Depending on the errors encountered our team would reach out to contacts with the corresponding upstream connections. A full list of datapoints/features on My VA and corresponding owners and means of contact can be found [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/README.md#my-va-features).
