## Moderator logistics

*Use [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/messages/C40B45NJK/details/) in Slack for real-time feedback from observers.*

*Before the session, send out the [observer instructions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/during-research/howto-observer-instructions.md) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel)).*

*In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute*

*In the Audio section, click the drop-down arrow and make sure "Play Entry/Exit Chimes" is unchecked*

*Check your [screensharing setup]*

*When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*

### Project-specific setup

- [ ] Make sure you have the [mobile research guidelines](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/mobile-research-guidelines.md) and are prepared to walk someone through how to install zoom on their phones if they don't have it, or the laptop hugging technique 
- [ ] have the mobile prototype available if person doesn't have any claims in progress: *add link*

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Tressa/Cassandra and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to have you take a look at  VA.gov on your phone and explore what's working and not working about that experience.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about [time].** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 
- **We are only looking at prototypes today** We will be interacting with screens that aren't fully designed out...something about it's just about content, grayscale prototypes

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

- Before we look at the website, can you tell me a little about yourself? 
    - What part of the country do you live in? What branch did you serve?
- What type of phone do you use? How do you typically use your phone versus your desktop if you have one?
- Do you currently or have you ever received benefits from the VA?
- Do you currently or have you ever received healthcare from the VA?
- Do you currently or have you ever filed a claim or appeal with the VA?

    - If user answers no to healthcare, benefits or claims, ask if they have logged onto va.gov within the last year.


## Logistics: figure out how to share your screen - 5 minutes

- Confirm with the participant that they are using a mobile device with Zoom installed
- If not, backup plan - load VA.gov in a "mobile frame" - open VA.gov in Chrome. Hit Command+Alt+J.  Backup to backup - moderator shares screen.

Let's start by making sure you can figure out how to share your screen on Zoom.

**If they are on an iPhone**
* Tap ‘Share content’ (Green button at bottom middle of the screen) If you can’t see the zoom menu, tap anywhere on your screen once ant it should appear.
* Tap on Screen
* Tap Zoom
* Tap start broadcast. After a count of 3, the entire device screen will be shared into the meeting
* Tap the red bar at the top of your screen when you are ready to end the share 
* IF THEY CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT
   * they can tap "share content" then tap "web URL" and just enter in VA.gov
* For troubleshooting screen sharing in iOS, reference the Zoom documentation here https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115005890803-iOS-Screen-Sharing   

**If they are on Android**
* Tap "Share"
* Tap "Screen"
* May give a "sensitive info" alert
* May ask you to give Zoom permission to display over other apps, toggle yes. The hit the back arrow . Then it might just share your screen.
* Tap "Start now" (maybe)
* For Android troubleshooting, try here: https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362153-Sharing-your-screen

**Ask participant to be mindful of thinking outloud since you will not be able to see a mouse cursor go through the prototype**

**Alternate between starting with version A and B for each participant**
