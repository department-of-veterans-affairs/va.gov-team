Conversation Guide for MyVA

Intro - 5 minutes

Start recording.

I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I

Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

1.
Before we look at the website, can you tell me a little about yourself? I
am an army veteran; I served for 15 years and came out as a captain. I
currently work at the American Legion with veterans.

2.

What type of phone do you use? How do you typically use your phone
versus your desktop if you have one? An Apple iPhone. I use my phone
when I am online for my phone then I use the phone for the passcode,

have used it to check into doctors due to COVID so there are ways to
check in and answer questions on the phone prior.

3.
Do you currently, or have you ever, received any benefits from the VA?
Yes, I currently am 60 percent disabled. I received VA disability.
o

If yes: How do you manage your benefits online? I have, like I
was able to add my spouse and child online. Then I applied for
education benefits online. My HealtheVet was used.
How often do you go online to manage your benefits? At
least monthly.

4.
Do you currently, or have you ever, filed a claim or appeal with the VA?
I have filed claims but not appeals.
Okay great, for this next question I'm going to share my screen really

o
If yes: Do you remember what you did? I usually go to myVA to

ALTERNATE STARTING WITH VERSIONS A AND B FOR EACH
PARTICIPANT

Intro

Okay great.

So, just a little bit of background, today we are going to be talking about a
personalized overview page, which is basically where you would go to view
all of your recent updates as well as an overview of your health care, benefit
or claims information. This page is intended to just be an overview of your
information - if you wanted to change or manage any of your information
that would be done on another page. Does that make sense? Yes.

1.
What information would you expect to be on your overview page? I
would expect to see labs, my vitals taken at the last visit, my last visit,
and my next visit.

Any questions before we get started? No.
Okay, so we are going to be comparing two versions of the same page. For
the sake of the exercise, please imagine that all of the information shown on
the page is your information. And just a reminder, these screens are
intentionally grayscale.

We are going to start with version (A or B), and I'll send you the link.

VERSION A

437719085_myVA_Mobile_A

First task: Overview & Updates

Go ahead and scroll through this page and walk me through your thoughts
on each section, starting with where you see your name (Charles) in the dark
grey box.

Nametag area/disability rating

They have the rating Where would it take you: I would expect it to take me to a page to
break down my items that were rated and I should eb given a tab to
print off the page so I can take it with me to prove I am a disabled
veteran.

Updates

They have 4 updates

What is working well: Get VA updates or? I would look at the 4 new
updates to see what was going on, I have 3 requests so I would go to
the claim. I have an accepted claim so I would identify what was
accepted. I would go into the cancelled appointment to see why then
go into the message from the doctor.

If you had multiple messages, grouped together: It just says I have one
there when down here it says I have 2 messages

Where would you put those: I would keep them there but where it says
I have 1 messages it should say I have new messages and when
clicked it would show the two messages.

What is not working well: The appointment has been cancelled is not
enough information, I don’t know what happens when you click
manage appointment. Will you be able to reschedule or will it tell you
why it was cancelled.

Additional thoughts: no.

What kind of updates are important: the messages from the provider
and the upcoming appointments. The claim updates aren’t as
important

Why not: They are not as time sensitive as upcoming appointments
and messages.

All recent updates, where would it take you: It should take me to the
messages, upcoming appointments and claim infomration.

Thoughts: no.

Claims

They have 3 requests for me so I would go there to see what they need
and the other was accepted

What information do you expect to see on this page: The claims that
have been process, in progress, and the results of the claims/appeals
that I have submitted.

If all details were on a separate page, would that work or not: That
would work for me because this page already has a lot.

What is missing in this section: I see a tab for file a claim for
compensation but not for appeals so I don’t know how I would go about
doing that.

Additional thoughts: no.

Health care

If the appointment were cancelled I would want to make sure I
cancelled it and not the va so making sure it doesn’t do against me. I
would look at the messages form the doctor. I don’t know why there
are 2 messages here and only 1 up top. I would refill anything I would
need to here.

What infomration would you want to see: The upcoming appointment is
important, all appointments. I don’t know if going to all appointments
shows past, present, and upcoming but that is important to have that
and the new messages and prescription. Seeing the results is nice to
have along with finding a va and viewing medical records.,

I would expect to see the labs and results if I had something done and
the messages from the doctors to be able to communicate.

What is the most important infomration: No because the messages
allow you to cover anything not in the test results plus you can read
your medical records to see what they said.

What information about the messages would you want to see: What
appointment the messages are from. The date that it came in, that is
pretty much it.

What else is important: the prescription I have and how many refiles I
have with the refile expiration date.

On a separate page: That would work.

Messages are important and the details are on a different page: As
long as there it takes me to it that would be fine.

Anything you would add: No. I cannot think of anything would add. Oh,
maybe a flu shot reminder.

If you had a reminder for healthcare, where would it be: I would think it
would be under prescription refills as a tab for a reminder for me to do
it.

Benefit applications

I don’t understand these, are they suggested or are they the one that
were applied for prior. It says application for vet tec and it is telling
them it was last open in May so it seems like they need to go back to
reapply. Then they would need to reapply for the dependency claim.

What information is the most important: The status of the application,
so this shows when it was open and when it expires and it attached the
file if you are close the expiration date

Add or change: no this seems like a nice bundle and it will help
veterans staying on top of it.

1.
What are your overall thoughts about this page? I like how they
highlight certain things. The font is large so it brings the eyes to it and
it is important to keep up with the appointments. They do the same for
the applications for things that need attention. It keep you involved in
everything and it is all on one page from claims to healthcare.

2.
What is working? You are able to keep up with updates, reply to the
provider and you know the disability percent. There is a lot of
information on the page. You can review the labs and test results, get
medical records. There is a lot of infomration on this one page.

3.
Anything you would change: no

4.
What is not working? No, it has a lot of information.

Second task: Claims scenario

Okay, great. Now, I'm going to give you a scenario. You've recently
submitted a claim and you are waiting to see if it has been approved. You've
just landed on this page.

1.
Could you walk me through how you would do that? So right now I
have 40% disability rating, 3 files requested by the VA. Let’s see, I
would probably go to claims in process.

2.
Why: Because right now I have 40% so I would want to check the
status on the claim I pout in for an increase.

3.
What infomration would you want to see: Whether a decision ahs been
made or when it will be made and the results.

4.
Is this easy or hard to find: It was kind of easy but there is a lot on here
because you have 3 requested then its has been accepted them
healthcare and then back to the claims, I would think that would be
closer to the claim’s status

5.
How could it be less confusing: pulling the claims and appeals titles up
under the title and keep the updates there, then under that have the
doctor’s messages and appointments.

6.
Thoughts: It just seems like all of the infomration should be grouped
together; it says the appointment ahs been cancelled it should eb
grouped all together.

Third task: Health care scenario

Okay, we're now going to move on to another scenario. Imagine you are
currently enrolled in health care with the VA. You've come to this page to see
when your next appointment is.

1.
Can you walk me through how you would do that? I would go to
upcoming appointment it has Saturday September 14
th
., if I weren’t
sure that was the only one I would just go to the 4 upcoming
appointments to see what else I had.

If they look for appointments in the updates section:

i.
Was it easy or hard to find your upcoming appointment? That
was easy to find because they highlight it.

ii.
Can you tell me why you think it would be in the health care
section? Because it is a healthcare it so it should be in the
healthcare sections

iii.

Thoughts: No

Fourth task: Benefits

Skip the fourth task if prototype is shown second
If you could go ahead and scroll down to the section that says, 'Benefit
applications'.

1.
What information is the most important to see about your benefit
applications?

2.
Do you find anything confusing at all?

3.
Is there anything that you would add or change about the benefits
section?

Transitioning between prototypes

Okay great, now let's move onto the second prototype, this is version (A or
B). I'm going to drop another link in the chat.

VERSION B

Link:
https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/HDZFDLY3WEZ#/437720005_myVA_Mobile_B

First task: Overview

Second task: Claims scenario

Go ahead and click on claims and appeals.

1.
What are your thoughts about this section?

2.
Is there anything that you would add or change about this section?

3.
If you clicked on 'Go to recent claims updates' where would you expect
that to go?

Okay great. Go ahead and go back to the previous screen by clicking 'Claims
and appeals' again. I'm now going to give you a scenario - imagine you are
trying to view all of your claims in progress and you've just landed on this
page.

1.
Could you walk me through how you would do that? Click on claims
then click on it to go to the others. It is an updated on the progress for
a claim that was submitted. I would expect to see the progress, either
its has been accepted or where it is. Does the VA know it was there,
have the va looked at it and then the final decision which wouldn’t be
here because it wasn’t made yet.

2.
Easy or hard: It was easy to find because it was up top. It is highlights
claims and appeals then click on updates to view what is in there

3.
Thoughts: No.

4.
Clicking on recent updates, where would it go: I would expect it to
show the progress for 3 file requests and the accepted claim and
where it is at this time.

Third task: Health care scenario

Okay, we're now going to move on to another scenario. Imagine you are
currently enrolled in health care with the VA. You've come to this page to see
the latest message from your doctor. Can you walk me through how you
would do that?

1.
Can you walk me through how you would do that? I would click on
healthcare and the updates. It says I have a new message so I would
view that.

If they look for messages in the health care updates section:

i.
Was it easy or hard to find your new messages? That was easy, it
just walks you through it. You go to healthcare then go to
updates and it is there.

ii.
Can you tell me why you think it would be in the updates
section?

Overall thoughts: Version A is easier because there is less
clicking, this one takes you to another section. For someone that
is older version A may be easier to follow then version B

What is working: It has a lot of infomration like it tells you what
prescription was filled and the date. This has more detail and
infomration.

What is not working: The fact that you have to click on tabs so an
older veteran may not be as familiar with computers and could
struggle with this.

Additional thoughts: It just seems like this is a bit more crowded
then version A and could be more intimidating then version a

What do you mean by crowded: Just the layout, you have the
things that are big but three is a lot of smaller print on here. That
may become overwhelming to look at visually.

Walk me through what you see: I have 3 updates so I click on
that. I don’t know if everyone one would to click on it but there
are two ways so that is helpful. IT tells me the appointment was
canceled and it provide3s more information about the
prescription so I like that. I see the new message here but down
below it says I have 2 messages so I would worry about missing a
message. That’s all

Go to recent healthcare, where would it take you: I would expect
it to provide the lab results, notes from the last visit and
upcoming appointment or past appointments.

What is missing here:  I cannot think of anything missing. One
thing that could be helpful is listing the VA location you are seen.
I always think of the older veterans, they may be confused. I live
in DC so I can e seen at the VA closest to me or the DC VA
because if I have a primary care appointment, is it by my house
or the DC location.

Okay great, thank you.

Transitioning between prototypes

Okay great, now let's move onto the second prototype, this is version (A or
B). I'm going to drop another link in the chat.

Comparison

Thanks so much! If you could go ahead and stop sharing your screen. Let's
take a look at versions A and B side-by-side.

Moderator shares screen and pulls upside by side screens

1.
Overall, which prototype do you prefer? Why? A, because it is visually
less confusing then version B. There are a lot of items on version b and
it is intimidating.

2.
Do you prefer to see updates at the top of the screen or collapsed in
each section? Collapsed into each section, version a tells me I have 4
updates so you can start to break it down for the updates.

3.
Updates on a or b: On version A.  Version A tells you at the top in bold
you have 4 new updates so you know what to look for when you follow
the page. You just go down and click on the updates. Whereas version
B doesn’t tell you how many updates you have so you have to scan the
entire page.

4.
How did these pages meet your expectations? They both have all of
the information besides the va location. They have the infomration you
need for claims, upcoming appointments, pulling lab results and do
secure messaging on both

5.
How did these pages not meet your expectations?  With the
appointment, it tells you when but not where. I don’t see a tba for
appointment infomration but is see mange appointment so that may
tell you where it is located. That is my main issue with both.

6.
Do you think you would or would not use this page when you log in to
VA.gov?  I would use this page, say I had labs taken I would check the
page then x rays I would revie wit here. It is nice to look at the notes
form past appointments, know the current rating, there is a lot of
infomration here so you can keep up you’re your infomration with
these pages.
o

if no: What would make this page more useful to you? I like how
version b have the benefits applications whereas A doesn’t they
just had what you were currently using. Version B lets you look
further into other benefits.
o

Useful for extra benefits: I think it would be a useful tab to have
on the page.
o

What would be in there: education benefits, I guess health
benefits, prosthetics, how to get hearing aids. I am not sure what
else.

7.
What would you call this page? My HealtheVet homepage.

8.

Any other thoughts?

Wrap-up and close

Okay, thank you so much! Those are all of the questions that I had for you
today, do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us
today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site
and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
