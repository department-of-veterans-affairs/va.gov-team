Conversation Guide for MyVA

Intro - 5 minutes

Start recording.

I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I
record my screen and the audio as we talk today? Yes.

Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

1.
Before we look at the website, can you tell me a little about yourself? I
am almost 50 year old navy veteran.

2.
What type of phone do you use? How do you typically use your phone
versus your desktop if you have one? I am on a galaxy note 10 plus. I
have a laptop but I use my phone more than my laptop.  I use it as a
mini portable computer.

3.
Do you currently, or have you ever, received any benefits from the VA?
Current receiving benefits.
o

If yes: How do you manage your benefits online? I know they
have transitioned a lot of stuff to va.gov but it is split between
ebenefits or myhealthevet and va.gov. Some things I have to go
to one or the other to do.

How often do you go online to manage your benefits?
Maybe once a month unless there is something specific
that I need to do or secure messaging.

What do you typically do to manage your benefits online? I
receive disability compensation.

4.
Do you currently, or have you ever, filed a claim or appeal with the VA?
Yes. Even the online version of doing it felt like you still have to be
repetitious and it seemed like they still processed it by hand a lot.

Okay great, for this next question I'm going to share my screen really
quick.

Moderator share screen with MyVA

5.
Do you remember if you have ever used this page on va.gov? I do.
o

If yes: Do you remember what you did? Typically when I have
been on it, it was to look at where my claim was or getting
information from decisions that have been made.

ALTERNATE STARTING WITH VERSIONS A AND B FOR EACH
PARTICIPANT

Intro

Okay great.

So, just a little bit of background, today we are going to be talking about a
personalized overview page, which is basically where you would go to view
all of your recent updates as well as an overview of your health care, benefit
or claims information. This page is intended to just be an overview of your
information - if you wanted to change or manage any of your information
that would be done on another page. Does that make sense?  Yes.

1.
What information would you expect to be on your overview page? As
far as healthcare, I think it as a dashboard where if you have upcoming
appointments or have things done soon. As far as benefits, it providing
me infomration about the benefits available for me as well as status of
any claims. Just a generalized status nothing in depth.

Any questions before we get started? No.

Okay, so we are going to be comparing two versions of the same page. For
the sake of the exercise, please imagine that all of the information shown on
the page is your information. And just a reminder, these screens are
intentionally grayscale.

We are going to start with version (A or B), and I'll send you the link.

VERSION A

https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/EDZFDJ7UWTC#/437719085_myVA_Mobile_A

First task: Overview & Updates

Go ahead and scroll through this page and walk me through your thoughts
on each section, starting with where you see your name (Charles) in the dark
grey box.

Second task: Claims scenario

Okay, great. Now, I'm going to give you a scenario. You've recently
submitted a claim and you are waiting to see if it has been approved. You've
just landed on this page.

1.
Could you walk me through how you would do that? I would scroll down
and when I see claims and appeals I would click on claims in progress.

2.
Easy or hard: It was not difficult. It took some scrolling but once I made it through the updates, it was right there under the subheading that
made sense.

Third task: Health care scenario
Okay, we're now going to move on to another scenario. Message from
doctor.

1.
Can you walk me through how you would do that? I see there is a
message from my doctor so I would look there, if that weren’t the one I
would scroll down to the new messages.

2.
Why in the updates section: because it has a mail icon that I have a
new message form my doctor if I am expecting one from my doctor.
Them sending a message back should show as a notification.

3.
Easy or hard: it was easy and if it weren’t from the doctor I expected, it
was easy to see all new messages. Down here where it says 2 new
messages, up here it says 1. It would make sense for it to say I have
new messages form my healthcare team or someway to click in from
there. I don’t know if I anyone would go down further .

4.
Would you expect them to show in the updates section: Probably, to
make sense in the system they would need to show as separate
messages saying I have a new message. My concern is that if you have
a new message but another comes in if you only see the newest. It
would need to show any new messages up there under recent updates.
As far as priority wise, me personally I would rather a new message
from my doctor prior to any of these items if that makes sense.

5.
If you had multiple message from the doctor, how would you want to
see it in the updates: If it is from a certain doctor it would be one box
but because I have more then one provider I think for it to make sense
they would need to show separately. But I would prefer them to be
shown closer to the updates section. A message form his doctor will be
more time sensitive then information on claims or compensation.

6.
If you could prioritize, what other would be the most important to see:
Messages from my doctor then for sure messages for appointments, if
it were cancelled or a reminder for the appointment within 24 hours.

7.
What would you change: I think the rest of it looks good, that was the
only thing I had a concern about.

8.
What is working well: It is providing good infomration about the
appointment and the claims that have been accepted and message
information. For secure messaging it will tell me I have one but not
from who. If I am looking for a message from a certain doctor I can
click directly and the appointment. Then it provides ways to take
actions.

9.
All recent updates, where would it go: I think it would show me a list of
recent updates for all categories listed above or any alerts that I had
but maybe not looked at.

10.
What is working will with version a: Anywhere that you have
infomration, there are areas to go see all of something or to get further
information that you may need. It is organized from healthcare,
claims/appeals, different things. The only thing that I see on this,
because of how it is categorized below the updates. It may be helpful
for the bold update thing to be in each category instead of a big block
at the top. It feels like continuous scrolling until you get to the end, it is
to long to scroll down on the phone anyways.

11.
Anything you would change or add to the page: I don’t think so.
It has all of the information you just need to fid where it is.

12.
Any other thoughts: No.

Okay great, thank you.

VERSION B

Link:
https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/HDZFDLY3WEZ#/437720005_myVA_Mobile_B

First task: Overview
Take a look at this page and let me know your thoughts starting with where
you see your name (Charles).

Nametag area/disability rating

It gives the name, overall disability rating but it looks like it will provide
more information about the breakdown of disabilities of the rating. It is
an overall dashboard breakdown or claims/appeals, healthcare, and
applications.

Where would it take you: To a list of disabilities that make up the
rating.

Claims and appeals/updates

What is working well here: I think it provides good infomration about
the status. Maybe where you are in the claim if it has been accepted or
information needed.

What doesn’t work well: Like I said before the wording on the alerts. If
it is talking about file requests or different things. There may be a need
for a key for people to understand what they need to do.

What updates would be helpful: If they have been approved or if I need
to provide anything so it is done within a timely manner. The step in
the process but I guess that would be accepted, reviewed, decision
made and waiting for approval.

Link to go to recent link updates, where would it go: To a listing of
recent claims and where they are within the process.

Overall, what information would you expect to see: Things I need to be
aware of. I would expect to be on the overview so I am able to take
care of them, if I didn’t have the information at the top I may never go
down enough to know I need to do what needs done. If I have to go all
the way through claims overview I may never know there’s an action
need.

What is missing: I think for this section it is all good information
because anymore then this would be less of an overview and more of
providing to much information in one area. You may not want
infomration on every single thing if you are just checking.

Other thoughts: no.

Anything else confusion: no.

Health care/updates

At the top it provides the updates and most recently been done that I
would be aware, if the appointment were cancelled and how to get in
contact with someone, the prescriptions that were filled. I would hope
it would provide tracking information so I would know if it were sent,
the message form my doctor which is an improvement because there
are a lot of steps to get to the secure messaging. Then other updated
there that would be able to provide  more infomration about the
appointments, messages form care team and then any prescriptions
that have been refilled. I can also see that I can view lab and test
results, get medical records, and find a va.

What is missing: For an overview it has information I would be looking
for to know what is going on with my healthcare at the va.
What information about appointments would you want here: where the

appointment is because I have appointments at different locations, the
time of the appointment, if it virtual or in person, maybe a link to the
virtual appointment so I don’t need to go through email to find it.

What appointment messages: My thoughts it would be similar to the
secure messaging system from my doctor and to my doctor or
someone from my team about my healthcare.

What about your prescriptions: just the name, when it was filled and
hopefully tracking information but I wouldn’t expect to find that until I
click into it.

What is the most important to see:  For me to manage things going on
would be knowing what appointments I have scheduled so I don’t miss
any appointments but I also like to see my lab/test results so I know
where I am on that as well.

On this page or another: for me it would be find for it to be on another
page just like upcoming appointments. It doesn’t need to be on this
page.

Benefit applications

I see different applications for benefits like adding a dependent or
some other program. This looks like it is forms to see if I need to file
dependent claims or for vet tec.

Anything confusing: I think this would be if I started a dependency
claim but not submitted it. This would be more in process but not fully
finished for it to be moved to make a decision on it

Why do you think that is confusing: No I don’t think it is confusing but
when I first looked at it I had to think of it. I saw when it expires and
when it was last opened so I determined that it was started then when
it was accessed to make changes.

How to make that more apparent: Maybe shoe the percentage of
completion in the corner to trigger that’s something that needs to be
finished.

Anything else you would add or change: No.

What’s the most important to see: Well if I am gathering infomration to
put in, how long I have it is before it expires to ensure that I don’t need
to go in to restart it.

1.
What is working? I think it puts it all in one area that you can get to
different areas instead of having to get to different sites and login to se
ethe information. It is all in one place.

What is not working? I mean overall it looks good. I don’t see anything
that is bad about it. It gets busier towards the bottom and knowing if
the other links takes you off the page may be a concern. Thoughts: No.

2.
What are your overall thoughts about this page? It is friendly to
navigate and fairly initiative.
Skip question 4 if prototype is shown second

4.
If you clicked on the disability rating, where would you expect that to
go?

Second task: Claims scenario
Go ahead and click on claims and appeals.

1.
What are your thoughts about this section?

2.
Is there anything that you would add or change about this section?

3.
If you clicked on 'Go to recent claims updates' where would you expect
that to go?

Okay great. Go ahead and go back to the previous screen by clicking 'Claims
and appeals' again. I'm now going to give you a scenario - imagine you are
trying to view all of your claims in progress and you've just landed on this
page.

1.
Could you walk me through how you would do that? What I see is the
basic infomration about the disability rating but to see the updated for
claims or appeals I would go to that section and use the arrow button it
open it and see if it shows the updated infomration.

2.
Thoughts: On the updates I am not sure what it means by you have 3
file requests but I guess it is something that I would need to provide to
them or they are looking at my file. The one below tells me it is
accepted and what it is. Ones an alert that something needs to be
done and the other is that one has been completed.

3.
Looking to see if its has been approved, where would you go: I would
probably go to the claims overview and claims in progress

4.
Why: Because it was submitted but not yet completed.

5.
Easy or hard to find: I think it is easy but the wording of the updates
may be confusing and for people to know what they need to do.

6.
How is it confusing: Maybe the terminology. Like where it says 3 file
requests, it is hard to know if they need you to send something or they
are accessing something. I think it is a terminology issue between the
person working with he file and the end user that needs to determine if
they need to do something

7.
How to make it better: On that just the wording on file request or
knowing if it is documentation. When they tell me they need something
it tends to be some sort of documentation. File request doesn’t make
sense or tell you if you need to provide something. I don’t know what
else would make sense besides spelling out if it is records or
documentation that you need to provide.

If they look for their claims in progress in the claim’s updates section:

i.
Why would you expect it to be in this section?

ii.
What information would you expect to see related to your claim?

What doesn't work well?

Third task: Health care scenario

Okay, we're now going to move on to another scenario. Imagine you are
currently enrolled in health care with the VA. You've come to this page to see
the latest message from your doctor. Can you walk me through how you
would do that?

1.
Can you walk me through how you would do that? I guess I would go to
the healthcare area and see if I can find it there. Okay.

2.
Thoughts: First I see if there is an appointment and if it was canceled.
It provides a contact number and you can manage it online such as
rescheduling. Then I go down farther and it tells me more about
upcoming appointment. I would go to upcoming appointments.

3.
Why: Because it is appointments in the future and it should provide all
future appointments. The one at the top tells me I need to manage the
one that was cancelled.

4.
Easy or hard: It is fairly eas7 because of the headings/dropdown lists
are clear. I also like that when it is things you need to know right away
it is right there at the top so it doesn’t get lost in the other areas.

If they look for messages in the health care updates section:

i.
Was it easy or hard to find your new messages?

ii.
Can you tell me why you think it would be in the updates
section?

Skip questions 3 if prototype is shown second

iii.
Is there anything that you would add or change about the
messages section?

applications'.

1.
What information is the most important to see about your benefit
applications?

2.
Do you find anything confusing at all?

3.
Is there anything that you would add or change about the benefits
section?

Transitioning between prototypes

Okay great, now let's move onto the second prototype, this is version (A or
B). I'm going to drop another link in the chat.

Comparison

Thanks so much! If you could go ahead and stop sharing your screen. Let's
take a look at versions A and B side-by-side.

Moderator shares screen and pulls upside by side screens

1.
Overall, which prototype do you prefer? Why? Version B because of
when you are at the main landing page you can look under the
category you get the updates . It is easy if it were under each of the
headings. I don’t remember it looking like that but looking at it I
remember now.

2.
Do you prefer to see updates at the top of the screen or collapsed in
each section? I like it collapsed in each section and it telling me I have
updates to look at.

3.
How did these pages meet your expectations? Both of them had the
information I need but it was the organization. It is just which is easy to
find the information and know what I need to deal with the B version
meet that more than anything.

4.
How did these pages not meet your expectations? Overall, they both
provided the information I needed. The usability on one was better
then the other, easier for me.

5.
Do you think you would or would not use this page when you log in to
VA.gov? Why? I think I would be likely to use either but it would be
more enjoyable to use version b. It has all of the information needed in
one location instead of having to go to multiple websites.

6.
What would you call this page? I would call it the dashboard because
that is where I will go to the different areas I need to. The va sites have
different names, is that more of your questions.

7.
Any other thoughts? 
Wrap-up and close

Okay, thank you so much! Those are all of the questions that I had for you
today, do you have any questions for me before we wrap up? 

No I really like
the version B. I hope it is more similar to what you guys come up with.
Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us
today. 

Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site
and make sure it really works for Veterans.
Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
