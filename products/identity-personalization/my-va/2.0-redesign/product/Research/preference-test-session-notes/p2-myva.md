Conversation Guide for MyVA

Intro - 5 minutes

Start recording.

I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? Yes I am

Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

1.
Before we look at the website, can you tell me a little about yourself?
Well I am semi-retired and work part time at oriley as a merchandiser.
In spare time I am restoring a 67 mustang for my wife because she has
always wanted. All my kids are grown and I have grandkids, I have my
wife we try to live a good life and go to church.
o
If stuck: What branch did you serve in?

2.
What type of phone do you use? How do you typically use your phone
versus your desktop if you have one? I have an iPhone 10. Well I use
my phone for just about everything, surf the internet, va apps to my
phone where I can easily access it. I use it for pretty much everything I
hardly get on the computer because I use my iPad and iPhone. I have
everything I need.

3.
Do you currently, or have you ever, received any benefits from the VA?
Yes I do. I receive my medicine, healthcare, and I am 90% disabled
through the VA.
o

If yes: How do you manage your benefits online? I look at them
often online on my HealtheVet and use secure messages for my
doctors.  I order my medication through the pharmacy app then I
search ebenfits for different things like if I need -pay history and I
have used the va.gov for ongoing claims to track them. They are
good sources out there.  I have seen a few things that I have
been on and seen some of them come to the front and seen
them on the va.gov and benefits I know this works and I know it
is an improvement for myself and other veterans.

Okay great, for this next question I'm going to share my screen really
quick.

Moderator share screen with MyVA

5.
Do you remember if you have ever used this page on va.gov? I don’t
think so. I don’t remember that. This is on VA.gov? No I don’t think I
have used it. I have used the tracking claims portion.

6.
Do you remember the experience: No it is self-explanatory. Right now,
it tends to tell you when it could be done but due to COVID they aren’t
telling you.  I don’t believe I have used this page though.

ALTERNATE STARTING WITH VERSIONS A AND B FOR EACH PARTICIPANT

Intro

Okay great.

So, just a little bit of background, today we are going to be talking about a
personalized overview page, which is basically where you would go to view
all of your recent updates as well as an overview of your health care, benefit
or claims information. This page is intended to just be an overview of your
information - if you wanted to change or manage any of your information
that would be done on another page. Does that make sense? Yes, I think I
know what you are saying. Like right now you have to go back and forth so
this page is putting them altogether on one page.

1.

What information would you expect to be on your overview page? I
would like to be able to get to my medical records, see thinks like my
claims, payment history, any ongoing claims or have going on. I would
love to see the status of my prescriptions, are they being filled,
processed or on the way. You order them and never know that status,
they just show up. It is frustrating because you order it and then they
wont process it. You wonder if they are gonna get here before you run
out. If you know it will relieve some of the pressure on people.

2.

Anything else: I can’t think of anything else, that is the biggest thing
because it would be n easier. You know how to go to ebenfits then you
have to go to va.gov and you have to login again. Benefits directs you
to va.gov, you would think you wouldn’t have to log back in but you do.

It is not convenient.

Any questions before we get started?

Okay, so we are going to be comparing two versions of the same page. For
the sake of the exercise, please imagine that all of the information shown on
the page is your information. And just a reminder, these screens are
intentionally grayscale.

We are going to start with version (A or B), and I'll send you the link.

VERSION A

First task: Overview & Updates

Go ahead and scroll through this page and walk me through your thoughts
on each section, starting with where you see your name (Charles) in the dark
grey box.

Nametag area/disability rating:

Updates:
(reading page) I am just scrolling through, the grey boxes. I don’t see
where they can be beneficial unless they are taking about specific
claims or appeals that they want you to look at. It is the same thing the
boxes down there 4 claims in progress, what is supposed to be the
difference with the white boxes and the grey boxes. Maybe it will make
more sense if you explain it, what is the thought process there.

What would you think is going on: Well I mean it says three files
requested, I don’t if that green box takes me to that claim or all claims
that need additional files. If that is the case what is the difference to
click on 4 claims in progress currently they tell you if they need
anything so I don’t know if I understand the grey scree.

Make it less confusing: Remove the grey boxes and just go to the white
boxes to see what those claims are. As a veteran that ahs been
through the process, I don’t need the government stuff and I just want
to see the progress, I don’t want to go trough 15 screens to get to it I
just need to see it. IF it can be as simple as click the white box and see
it that would be beautiful.

Claims:

Health care: appointment information- the appointment sentiment it
tells me I have 4 appointments but then I see the big va appointment
box at 1130. I assume that the white box is my next appointment
coming up and the 4 upcoming appointments you can see all upcoming
appointments. I like that but I would also like to see what clinic and
where the appointment is at. I live in between two VA’s so I guess I am
lucky because I don’t have to travel to far so particular things. It would
be nice to know exactly which VA and what clinic it is at. The new
messages are good and the prescription refiles, will it tell me the
status / on the way or still being process. I would like to see that./ Then
the rest is self-explanatory until we get to benefits applications. I don’t
want to speak on that because I don’t know who that is for, I am not
sure what it is. I don’t know a VA form 686.

Benefit applications:

1.
What are your overall thoughts about this page? No, Like I said if the
grey boxes are supposed to tell me something different then the white
boxes with full progress. If it is one claim then I can understand that
and it will take me there for exactly what I need. That is the only
reason I can think of the grey box being used. I think the 4 claims in
progress should tell me everything I know.

2.
Where would your changes be: I would think some type of notification.
Let’s say I have two claims in progress and they know as well as
everyone we don’t always go to benefits or va.gov each day so we
don’t know if they need something, it would be nice if they emailed us
to check our claims to see what they need in order to speed the claim
up. I don’t think it would be that hard to do.

Transitioning between prototypes

Okay great, now let's move onto the second prototype, this is version (A or
B). I'm going to drop another link in the chat.

VERSION B

Link:
https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/HDZFDLY3WEZ#/
437720005_myVA_Mobile_B

First task: Overview

Take a look at this page and let me know your thoughts starting with where
you see your name (Charles).

Nametag area/disability rating:

I really like that, that is a good thing you don’t have to go search for it.
I like that. I don’t know the arrow intended but I like that.

What do you mean: It has 40% disability then an arrow like it will go to
another screen or function

Where would it go: I don’t know maybe your pay history. I am not
really sure what they intend for that.

Claims and appeals/updates:

The claims and appeals tell you what you have there. That is a good
function, I don’t know if the drop down would go to the status. I would
think that it would. I mean I like that; you don’t have to search for it. It
is there.

Health care/updates:

Benefit applications:
1.
What are your overall thoughts about this page?
2.

What is working?  I am not sure what you mean. Everything here so far
makes sense to me. It is laid out clearly. I even see the healthcare
there; I don’t know what all it does there if you can go to medical
records or appointments. It tells me there are 3 updates. I would
expect that to be lab results, upcoming appointments, or something
like that. I like the way it is laid out; I like that.

3.
What is not working? Let me look at the whole page, okay. I guess
what is not clear to me is under the healthcare portion if the drop down
menu for appointments. It wouldn’t work for me if they haven’t done
anything for the appointment aspect, it would just tell you, you have
an appointment and on the date but not what it is for. A lot of times I
don’t get the appointment or I forget to write it down so I have to call
to see what it is for it would be nice to have the date, location, who its
with and what its for. Something like that would be super super nice.
Skip question 4 if prototype is shown second

4.
If you clicked on the disability rating, where would you expect that to
go?

Second task: Claims scenario

Go ahead and click on claims and appeals.

1.
What are your thoughts about this section? You have three files
requested from the va, then I assume that they need additional
information for the claim you submitted. That’s what I would take from
it then you can go to the claim, I assume you click that and it tells you
want you need. It is self-explanatory. Okay, it tells you it has been
accepted but I don’t know what 526 dependency claim, I don’t know
what they are talking about, are they saying the claim was received?

2.
What do you think: Well your claim was accepted, I assume they are
saying that they received it and they are ready to make a decision or
need more information or need an C&P. Down below you can go to
recent claim updates, I would hope that is where you can go to see the
recent status of the claim.

3.
Is there anything that you would add or change about this section?

4.
Claims overview: I think by the arrow if you want to see the progress
you click on the arrow and it takes you to the page where you can see
the status, or if they need additional information. I know before they
had a date on them when they would be completed and able to make a
decision. That is what I assume that means.
Okay great. Go ahead and go back to the previous screen by clicking 'Claims
and appeals' again. I'm now going to give you a scenario - imagine you are
trying to view all of your claims in progress and you've just landed on this
page.

1.
Could you walk me through how you would do that? Go to claims and
appeals and it would tell you where to go for claims and appeals. Yeah
once you open that up it tells you that you need 3 files request, from
there to click on go to claim and it would tell you what files and for
what claim they would need it. Then the next one the claim was
accepted so I assume to can go to claim and it would tell you more
details about what is going on with the claims.

2.
Why would it be in updates: Well it says go to claims. Here is
something I am confused about; we are in claim updates then it has
the grey block then go to claims. It tells me that I go there for the
updates. Then the claim ahs been accepted but then there is go to
recent claims update, is that everything within claims
3.
What do you think: The way I would read that I think it would go to
because I would think it is all claims from that link. It would make
sense for it to say all recent claims if that is what it is intended for.
These look like individual claims the that would be all recent claims
would be there. Or you could choose if you want to see claims in
progress or appeals.

4.
If you could design it how would it happen: That’s the only thing it is
only a little confusing, is it the first claim in the grey box or the second
or maybe a little more description of what it entails. It seems
redundant because there is one claim and then you can go to recent
claims, why would we need to go to recent claim if we can go to
overview and see the same infomration we don’t need all the other
stuff if we can go to overview.
If they look for their claims in progress in the claim’s updates section:

i.
Why would you expect it to be in this section? If it is a claim, I
would expect to see the status or if they need infomration, if it is
being reviewed and what the status is. What the progress of the
appeal is, do they need information, when is it going to be done,
those type of things is what I would expect to be.

ii.
If it were on a sperate page is it useful or not: it would be useful
if it took me to that page, especially not having to go on a
different website then have to search for it.
iii.

Missing: I don’t think anything is missing for the claims. From my
past experiences what I want to see I can see from this page
here. I really do, my biggest concern is, did they receive it, is it
processed, do I need to do anything and when is it projected to
be completed. I think I can see that from here.

iv.
Most important to see: the progress.
If they look for their claims in progress in the claims section:

v.
Why would you expect it to be in this section?
Skip questions 2 if prototype is shown second

vi.
What information would you expect to see related to your claims
here? Where the claim is at. I guess that would be the only thing.
Just where is it at and do I need to do anything about it. As
dealing with the military, we have to sit back and wait. TO know
the status and not have to anticipate where is it at, what’s
happening, do they need anything, that would be wonderful to
have there for me and any other veteran out there waiting on a
claim.

vii.
Did you think it was easy or hard to find your claims in progress?

viii.
What works well?

ix.
What doesn't work well? It all makes sense to me, it makes more
sense then what we got right now, this is going to be easier to
find out things . Looking at this it seems as it would because
everything is laid out, you don’t need to go search where it is at.
It all seems to be right here.

Third task: Health care scenario

Okay, we're now going to move on to another scenario. Imagine you are
currently enrolled in health care with the VA. You've come to this page to see
the latest message from your doctor. Can you walk me through how you
would do that?

Tell me about this: Upcoming appointments, I don’t know where the arrow
will take you if it just says that the location is here and here’s you date. That
doesn’t mean much to the veteran, they send an email reminder but they
are really hard to understand. 28
th
of September it tells me I have an
appointment at 11am in Nashville, but what clinic, I have no idea. My Primary
care will make an appointment and I don’t know what it is for. They will look
it up on the computer when I get there and they will tell me where to go. If I
could click on it and it tells me who my appointment is with, where, and
when then I would know what I need to do.

Type, and where, what is the most important: What they do now is sending
us email reminders and it provides date, time and location but where do I
need to go when I get there. It would be nice for them to say sys clinic if it is
at the eye clinic, at times they will send a reminder card, will MU-pl, I don’t
know what that is but that’s the clinic name and I don’t know what that
means. Let’s just put it in simple terms like primary care, diabetic clinic, stuff
that we understand and would be easier. Other veterans don’t know where
the clinics are either buts thing I can say is go to information and have them
bring it up on the computer. Half the time veterans are trying to find where
they are going and we really don’t know where to go. I have to know when I
need to get there and go to the infomration desk to find out where I am
going.

How would you do that: Go to healthcare and go straight to my message and
my inbox.

Easy or hard to find the messages: If it is easy to see the prescriptions and
messages that may be 3easier. Most pages are laid out what is in the page
like what you can find on it. That may be helpful to have that.

Healthcare updates mean: Anything that pertains to your primary care
doctor that was going on with them, lab work needing to be done, anything
like that. It is pretty go there, I like how it is there once you get into it, it is
self-explanatory. I like the way it is laid out; the grey screens are redundant
and the blocks about the appointments, messages and prescriptions. I don’t
know if the grey boxes will do anything differently than going straight to the
blocks. If it will carry you to the appointments then just leave the boxes with
upcoming appointments so you know you are going there, I don’t if the great
boxes are the latest appointment or upcoming or what it really is.

1.
Can you walk me through how you would do that? (new messages) I
can’t say anything about the messages now because I do that off of
myhealthevet, I don’t know if this would be simpler, the way it is set up
now I don’t have an issue with it because if I email them when they
respond I get a direct email telling me I have a secure message so I
know to login to myhealthevet to read the message. I don’t know if this
would be easier, I am not really sure.

2.
If you say this message section what would it be: I would expect it to
be the same thing to the message that they replied to would be there.

3.
What about prescriptions: We can see that we have a prescription
through the process but what I would like to see is the status of the
prescription, where is it and when can I expect it, is it going to get here
on time or do I need to go to the VA to get a 7 day supply because I am
out. That is what I would like to see.

4.
What if it were on a separate page: that would be fine with me if the
arrow will take me to that page where it is at.
If they look for messages in the health care updates section:

What kind: I am waiting on an appointment with my outside doctor that
they are making for me. I would like to see if those appointments have
been made, who they are with and when they would be. I would also
like to see the lab results that were recently been done to not have to
go between two webpages to see them because all information is not
on one page. If that were here on recent updates that would be great.

Would you add anything:  No I think we discussed everything. Maybe
just put the primary care infomration or upcoming appointments up in
the updates because I see the view lab and rest results there. If that
takes you to another page that would be great.

Fourth task: Benefits

Skip the fourth task if prototype is shown second

If you could go ahead and scroll down to the section that says, 'Benefit
applications'.

What are you seeing here: VA form 686 I have never had to do that and I am
not sure what it is. I don’t know what to say about them because I have
never dealt with them. This is probably for people that retired with
dependents that still get benefits.

What do you expect to see about your applications: I don’t really know what
that could mean. I think I get everything I am entitled to so the benefit
application would be additional benefits or something but I am not sure how
that would affect me. 

1.
What information is the most important to see about your benefit
applications?

2.
Do you find anything confusing at all? Okay, I am not sure what they
mean benefits applications. Maybe say it is benefits for retirees or
benefits like for 100%  disabled individuals, there are different benefits
then I am entitled to so if it said something like that.

3.
Is there anything that you would add or change about the benefits
section? I cannot really elaborate; I would hate to say something I
don’t know what I am talking about.

Transitioning between prototypes

Okay great, now let's move onto the second prototype, this is version (A or
B). I'm going to drop another link in the chat.

Comparison

Thanks so much! If you could go ahead and stop sharing your screen. Let's
take a look at versions A and B side-by-side.

Moderator shares screen and pulls upside by side screens

1.
Overall, which prototype do you prefer? Why? I think I like the B
version a little bit better, it is a bit simpler in its layout. I hate to go to
the grey boxes but I don’t see the point of them you can go to the
aliens or appeals unless it wants us to do something specific but I think
I like B better. Maybe I am not looking at it right, when an opens
everything is there, all of the grey boxes and b opens up to a more
condensed page when it is first open. I assume the second is after
something was open but A just opens to everything. I think b would
work better, the page isn’t as busy as a. It is simpler, I like b better
because I can open what I want to.

2.
What do you mean more simple: Like on a everything is open all of the
grey boxes and to get to where I want to go in a timely manner I have
to read all of the gray boxes and see what I want to open whereas on
page b it is right there I don’t have to read 10 other boxes I want
healthcare and I just click on it. It seems more condenses and
simplified.

3.
Do you prefer to see updates at the top of the screen or collapsed in
each section?

4.
How did these pages meet your expectations? It is better than I
thought it would be. It seems like it will be a lot easier once it is up and
running. It is a lot better than I thought it would be. I thought it would
be a page that you have to enter 15 times then see things but if we
can put it in once and see everything that is fantastic.

5.
How did these pages not meet your expectations?  I think b but a does
not because it is to busy. I don’t know maybe it is because I like things
as simple as I can get them. I don’t like going to 10 different places
and I think b can do that for me.

6.
Do you think you would or would not use this page when you log in to
VA.gov? I like b and the way it is. Let’s say for instance we went to
claims and appeals but the va doesn’t need anything let’s just say it is
opened and we have 3 claims, it just pops up to see the status of them
but on the other hand out of those 3 claims 1 claim needs more
infomration. Like additional medical records, I can see where the grey
box is beneficial, it would be nice to know what the claim is for and it
pops up and tells you that that they need one additional file and you
will know what claim it is for and what you need to go get.

7.
What would you call this page? I like it being call myVA because that
what it is and it pertains to me so I like myVA.

8.
Any other thoughts? No, you have done a great job. I can see the
progress and results of it, it is fantastic.
Wrap-up and close
Okay, thank you so much! Those are all of the questions that I had for you
today, do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?
Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us
today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site
and make sure it really works for Veterans.
Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
