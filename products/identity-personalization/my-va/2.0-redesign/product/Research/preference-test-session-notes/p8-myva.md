Conversation Guide for MyVA


Intro - 5 minutes

Start recording.

I have started recording
. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I
record my screen and the audio as we talk today? Yes.

Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

1.
Before we look at the website, can you tell me a little about yourself?
So I am a 20 year veteran from the Army and was medically retired in
2017. I am 100 percent disabled due to PTSD and sleep apnea

2.
What type of phone do you use? How do you typically use your phone
versus your desktop if you have one? Samsung 9. At the beginning of
COVID I used the desktop for serval VA medical appointments but most
of them have changed to my phone. I haven’t used my laptop in the
past 2 months. I used to use live exercises on the laptop because it is
easier than it on my phone.

3.
Do you currently, or have you ever, received any benefits from the VA?
Yes. I am 100 percent so I get financial benefits and an extra stipend. I
use the canteen and cafeteria. I had surgery recently so I had the
travel services.
o

If yes: How do you manage your benefits online? 
How often do you go online to manage your benefits? I
manage my appointments online. I don’t use the shopping
online, for travel I had to call. For community care was for
the phone. I manage appointments, messaging providers
and medication refills.

What do you typically do to manage your benefits online? I
go to myhealthevet at least once a week.

Okay great, for this next question I'm going to share my screen really
quick.

Moderator share screen with MyVA

5.
Do you remember if you have ever used this page on va.gov? No
specifically myVA but yesterday I reviewed the email and looked at the
yoga class. That has claims but mine were done before I was
discharged and I did all of my appeals while on active duty. I am
familiar with the va website though.

ALTERNATE STARTING WITH VERSIONS A AND B FOR EACH

PARTICIPANT

Intro

Okay great.

So, just a little bit of background, today we are going to be talking about a
personalized overview page, which is basically where you would go to view
all of your recent updates as well as an overview of your health care, benefit
or claims information. This page is intended to just be an overview of your
information - if you wanted to change or manage any of your information
that would be done on another page. Does that make sense? Yes.

1.

What information would you expect to be on your overview page? 
Were it has the disability, is it permanent or temporary.

2.

How would you make that less confusing. The next line I would expect
to have the number then the type of disability. That all impacts the
results of the claim and the claims and appeals you have 2 new
updates but since when. Only two new updates, normally it will tell you
that you have a new message and the date. Then healthcare enrolled
sense that date, is it VA healthcare or all healthcare.

3.
What do you expect it to be: when you in process at the va you have to
provide all insurance plans so I think it includes my Tricare due to
retiring or is that only VA healthcare.

4.
What would you assume: I assume since he is 40% he isn’t retired so it
would be VA due to him not being entitled to Tricare.

Any questions before we get started?

Okay, so we are going to be comparing two versions of the same page. For
the sake of the exercise, please imagine that all of the information shown on
the page is your information. And just a reminder, these screens are
intentionally grayscale.

We are going to start with version (A or B), and I'll send you the link.

First task: Overview & Updates

Go ahead and scroll through this page and walk me through your thoughts
on each section, starting with where you see your name (Charles) in the dark
grey box.

What is working about this page: I like the face it tells me an appointment as
cancelled. Then the patient or provider cancellation. I am curious about it but
I am not sure how it effects my healthcare. The message, who’s that, I don’t
know the doctor. I prefer more dates or progress lines. For healthcare you
must put VA healthcare because when you talk about a VA appointment, it is
a simple fix but I know the military system talks to the VA system.
Prescription refills again I am too sure if it is on the way, needs picked or can
eb requested. The upcoming appointments need for the next two weeks or
month. I am still not sure what last opened means on the application. View
lab and test results, why don’t you make it as lab and test results then click
here. I don’t know why you need to find a VA facility, if you are this point why
are you looking for it. I am not sure va medical records why they are on here
or right there is where it needs to be.

Where would they go: Find a va facility would be at the bottom under
resources. It ahs nothing to do with this information. Lab and test results
should be a box. VA medical records if you want to put that at the end that’s
fine but yeah.
Updates

We talked about the message and I assume she send it on October 1.
Often times you will get a message from the PCM nurse that you never
met so that’s why it is even more important to have the clinic name. I
received many messages and they didn’t know who it was. My PCM
quit in August so I was changed clinics and I emailed the green team
questions and they told me I have a new provider then I received a
new email because my PCM cancelled all medications until she met me
which was a disaster so I couldn’t get my meds and I started getting
messages from her nurse. They had to use the VA directory to figure
out who messaged me. It is really important to know the doctors
department because you may not know the doctors name.
The appointment has been cancelled is simple enough. Maybe for
veterans that are requesting transportation so they can call and cancel
but that is a stretch so that may be why it is important.
VA claim accepted, need applied on the date and accepted on the
date. If you are giving dates on one piece you need it throughout.

1.
What are your overall thoughts about this page?  The 4 new updates, if
you look at the dates, how are they ordered. Are they by section? Or
are they by date? I am not really sure.

2.
How would you like it: by date. My only concern is having to click to
many places for older veterans they may be confused with the errors
or accidently click it and goes somewhere else. I like you would need to
look at the population you are working with for design.

3.

What is working?

4.
What is not working?
Skip question 4 if prototype is shown second

4.
If you clicked on the disability rating, where would you expect that to
go?

Okay, now let's take a look at the updates section.

1.
Can you describe to me what you're looking at?

2.
What kind of updates would be helpful to you?

3.
If you clicked on 'Go to all recent updates' where would you expect
that to go?

4.
What works well?

5.
What doesn't work well?

Second task: Claims scenario

Okay, great. Now, I'm going to give you a scenario. You've recently
submitted a claim and you are waiting to see if it has been approved. You've
just landed on this page.

1.
Could you walk me through how you would do that? I would go to the
claim section for dependency because it has been accepted.

2.
Why there: you asked if I was accepted for a claim or not.

Third task: Health care scenario

Okay, we're now going to move on to another scenario. Imagine you are
currently enrolled in health care with the VA. You've come to this page to see
when your next appointment is.

1.
Can you walk me through how you would do that? It would be under
upcoming appointment.

If they look for appointments in the updates section:

i.
Was it easy or hard to find your upcoming appointment? It is
easy but I am not sure where the appointment is. It would be
clearer if it says if it is phone, telehealth or at the va facility. It
says when. It doesn’t answer who its with, what appointment,
where the appointment is. I like it says Saturday September 14th
because I want the date then the additional information because
of planning. That has been a challenge lately I have had to call to
confirm if it is a link, or a phone call form the va.

ii.
Prefer it to be on this page or separate page: no it should be
right there. It doesn’t need the doctors name. This only tells you
when.

Fourth task: Benefits

Skip the fourth task if prototype is shown second

If you could go ahead and scroll down to the section that says, 'Benefit
applications'.

1.
What information is the most important to see about your benefit
applications?

2.
Do you find anything confusing at all?
3.

Is there anything that you would add or change about the benefits
section?

Transitioning between prototypes

Okay great, now let's move onto the second prototype, this is version (A or B). I'm going to drop another link in the chat.

VERSION B

Link:
https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/HDZFDLY3WEZ#/
437720005_myVA_Mobile_B

First task: Overview

Take a look at this page and let me know your thoughts starting with where
you see your name (Charles).

Nametag area/disability rating

I am looking at the name, rating, claims and appeals.
What do you expect to happen when clicking on the link: if you had an
appeal, let’s say you were 10 percent then to 30 percent or
downgraded. I would like to see all of those when you were permanent
or temporary. If you were given extra entitlements and all of the dates.
Claims and appeals/updates

The va is requesting 3 additional pieces of information but it doesn’t
say when it is due but it shows that the request was given October 5th.

There has to be a suspense to it right, let’s say you aren’t tech savvy
and you don’t sue it. They didn’t know that they needed the
infomration. It needs to show when ire viewed the message and when
it is due. If not then they can close it due to not providing the
infomration but how do you know they saw it. We know when they
updated it as needing the information but when I click it, it should tell
me when it was received, when it was reviewed by me and when it
needs to be submitted.

On a sperate page: yes that is what I am saying. I would want to know
when it is due on here though.

Go to recent claims update, where would it go: Like a history of all
claims, when it was reviewed, when its deadline for additional
information and when it was approved. It would be more of a history of
the VA side then mine.

Health care/updates

If the VA has a deadline so I know when to look instead of going back
weekly. When items need to be submitted. If it is pending review,
higher review. A good thing would eb if there were a little line that
would have the 3 different stages to show the progress. Like a
progress bar.

Overall what is working well: The claims overview is working well if you
are looking at the summery and want it to be simple. When something
is accepted that is well.

What is not working well: the dependency claim was accepted but
when was it accepted, is it postdated and get back pay? Is it accepted
or is it approved.

What would you assume: IF it were accepted they could be looking at
it, if it is approved you should be expecting a change in payment.

That’s why it is important to have the dates.

What would you do. Exactly like I said I would date it and if it were
approved or not. Then the date it takes effect because that would be
helpful. There is a difference in the dependency claims because you
can have more then one so how many dependency claims were
approved.

What is missing: Dates. And when should I expect a response, fi there
are 4 different claims you need to be able to go see the dates and the
monetary amount.

What do you mean monetary: if you have a spouse vs a spouse and
three kids: there is a difference in your payments. Let’s say you get 2K
then a spouse is adde3d. if approved in October should I get it for
October or does it start in November. This is so I don’t need to talk to
finance or have in inquire about payments.

Questions: Progress bar, where is higher level review is on that. I am
not sure what the reviews are. Was there an initial review.

If the progress bar exists would that work if it wer4e on a separate
page: yes. The way it is set up now besides the dependency claim
there isn’t enough information. Even if you are approved for one claim
you should all have dates. The disability claim for right should was
approved on October 5th and retroactive to September of 2010. Make
sense.

What works well for healthcare: The first on for the va appointment, I
think you should use VA a lot more because with the military
prescription system talks to the VA side. I would assume you are giving
updates to both instead of just VA. The prescription has been filled, is it
mailed or do you need to go to the pharmacy

What do you think: I don’t know everything comes through the mail for
me. In my case I would assume it would be here in 7 days but if I see
this and I am at the VA I would assume it was the pharmacy
If I weren’t here what would you do: it depends where I am. If I am at
the VA I would go ask if they had the prescription. Since I just had a
new PCM, the new message needs to show which clinic it is coming
form I have had doctors that I don’t know their names or clinic.
What information do you mean: Like ortho, psych, eye, dental, primary
care. It’s just like the sign in the hospital. If the sign says orange clinic
then it needs to say orange  clinic don’t get fancy. If it says ortho it
needs to say ortho or ortho physical therapy. If I am at the va where do
I go to ask the question.

Recent healthcare updates, where would it go: One way is if you were
given a referral or another way is policy updates they want you to be
aware of.

What infomration about appointments on this page: how it has
upcoming appointments I like that but give timeframes. If it is a week I
am not tracking 4 in the next week but in the next month. But yeah
anyway timeframe.

On a different page would that work: No I would rather see it on this
page because it makes me want to click to the next page.
Message information, what would you like: That’s it. That’s perfect.
What about prescriptions: I am not really sure if it means one
prescription was refilled or one could be refilled. So when you request
the refill you have to do it 2 weeks in advance or is there one I need to
pick up or one coming in the mail so I should be looking for it. The
plural of refill is different than one prescription refill. It is available for
request of refill now. I am not sure if you are telling me if it is coming in
the mail, it needs picked up or eligible for refill. Maybe refilled would
make me look for it or refilled at pharmacy, or 1 prescription refill
available.

Infomration on this page or a different page: The way it is written right
now, refilled I can click on the next page. One available for refill I would
want on this page, then click on the next page to refill.
Anything to add or change: I would add the referral is suspended so
something with referrals I would add to the healthcare section.
Community care would be in there and current and pending referrals
and when they are completed. Maybe eligibility of certain entitlements
like eyeglasses, dental exam, anything with an annual requirement
because nothing is lined up anymore. The pandemic shifted all of that
so individuals with memory issues or older veterans may have issues
keeping up with their healthcare.

Questions: no but you need the department on the messages.

Benefit applications

First of all I don’t know what vet tech that is so I assume it is
education, I don’t know. The deadline is the expired line, the last
opened I don’t know fi that means by me or the va to review the status
of the claim. I am not sure what last opened means. It is due October 12th
but when did I open it and no one contact me but you need new information.

How would you make it less confusing: first thing should be when was
it applied for or applied, submitted claim then a date. The expires, is
that the deadline then its closed and no action is taken. Then last
opened by the individual or the va, maybe last reviewed by the VA.

What does open mean.

What do you assume: that’s what I am saying I don’t know, is that
when I last opened it or last opened by the va

What if I weren’t here what would you think: The last time I looked at
the message. When you look at a message from the provider it tells
them when or if you viewed the message as well.
Thought son this section: No I think it is pretty clear, if I thought I
applied for something and its not here then I need to take action.

Second task: Claims scenario

Go ahead and click on claims and appeals.

1.
What are your thoughts about this section?

2.
Is there anything that you would add or change about this section?

3.
If you clicked on 'Go to recent claims updates' where would you expect
that to go?

Okay great. Go ahead and go back to the previous screen by clicking 'Claims
and appeals' again. I'm now going to give you a scenario - imagine you are
trying to view all of your claims in progress and you've just landed on this
page.

1.
Could you walk me through how you would do that? You would click
claims and appeals down arrow. See that is exactly how I expected to
have the dates. I would except a date on the dependency claim to oh
no it was approved. Then click the arrow that says go to claim. You
have three file requests, oh to see the claims in progress you would
click 4 claims in progress sunder claim overview.

If they look for their claims in progress in the claim’s updates section:

i.
Why would you expect it to be in this section? Because it is the
summary of all of the claims verse the updates on the claims.

ii.
Easy or hard: I would say it is easy if I were looking for current
climes in progress.

Third task: Health care scenario

Okay, we're now going to move on to another scenario. Imagine you are
currently enrolled in health care with the VA. You've come to this page to see
the latest message from your doctor. Can you walk me through how you
would do that?

1.
Can you walk me through how you would do that? Down arrow on
healthcare because right now it tells me that I have this many
messages and you just logon now. So the summery is much easier to
read than what you currently look at but to find it on here isn’t easier
than it currently is.

2.
How could you find the messages here: Here it tells me it is under
healthcare but you have to search for it because it is with prescriptions
and appointments. Currently it is under tis own button labeled
messages.

If they look for messages in the health care updates section:

i.
Was it easy or hard to find your new messages? More difficult
then currently.

ii.
Overall thoughts on the page: So I am assuming if I click on the
right arrow to appointments because all appointments are in a
spread sheet format now. The new messages, if it were me the
bottom portion would be on the top and the top on the bottom. I
would rearrange it so it is easier. I would want to see the
upcoming appointments, messages, and prescriptions instead of
filtering through everything.

iii.
What would you expect to see under healthcare: Currently lab
results, test results, appointments. Let’s say if you are authorized
physical therapy and how many you have. Right now it is not
clear, if you have 6 weeks of therapy how many you used and
how many is remaining. Currently it is not available

iv.
How do you currently access it: Normally when the session run
out they tell me and then I need a new referral and there is a
delay in healthcare.

Okay great, now let's move onto the second prototype, this is version (A or B). I'm going to drop another link in the chat.

Comparison

Thanks so much! If you could go ahead and stop sharing your screen. Let's
take a look at versions A and B side-by-side.
Moderator shares screen and pulls upside by side screens

1.
Overall, which prototype do you prefer? Why? I think B. I don’t really
like grey scale. The only contact us is in a weird spot. The first one has
more information right there and have to click more but the second
one you have to know to click to all of the different places. Can you
scroll down on B please. Yeah I would say B. Claims and appeals don’t
apply, I haven’t requested additional benefits. That is what you are
looking for. B doesn’t have the messages form your doctor, everything
use is in A.

2.
If it was built for you: I use A the most right now.

3.
Do you prefer to see updates at the top of the screen or collapsed in
each section? Both, I like the font because it draws your eyes to the
sections in B but I like the information in A. I would like the claims
appeals then infomration, then healthcare then information. Set up like
B but with the information as A. Version B doesn’t have healthcare like
Version A have messages and appointments.

4.
All updates at the top: Yes.

5.
How did these pages meet your expectations? I think that the VA is
trying to make it easier but there is going to be a bigger challenge on
how to do it.

6.
How did these pages not meet your expectations? Did not provide
enough information anywhere, in title or follow on.

7.
Do you think you would or would not use this page when you log in to
VA.gov? I would use it because I use myhealthevet for a majority of my
care.

8.
What would you call this page? I know you can’t use myhealthevet but
something similar.

9.

Any other thoughts?

Wrap-up and close

Okay, thank you so much! Those are all of the questions that I had for you
today, do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?
Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us
today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site
and make sure it really works for Veterans.
