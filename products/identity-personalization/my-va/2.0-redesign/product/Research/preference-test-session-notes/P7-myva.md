### Conversation Guide for MyVA

Intro - 5 minutes

Start recording. I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I
record my screen and the audio as we talk today? Yes, I am.

Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

1.
Before we look at the website, can you tell me a little about yourself? I am an 8 year army veterans with combat tours. Recently graduated with my masters in art for scince3s, transnational security and now waiting to start work for the start departments so when it comes to the
federal government it takes time so I am hanging out with my kitten and girlfriend and biting my tongue until I can start work.

2.
What type of phone do you use? How do you typically use your phone
versus your desktop if you have one? It is a Galaxy S20 plus 5G or
something like that. Personal or professional, I use my phone to chat
with friends, make calls, surf the internet, use for GPS, play games and
things like that when bored or the general things. For business I use
the computer and for listening to music.

3.
Do you currently, or have you ever, received any benefits from the VA?
Yes I am currently 30 percent disabled so I receive payments each
month and I use the post 9-11 GI Bill.

4.
Doctors: sometimes, I workout extensively and sometime I have to go
in and I went to get tested for COVID. Luckily, I tested negative, other
than that I go there for routine stuff as well.


If yes: How do you manage your benefits online? Sometimes to
determine my appointments, it is easier to do that online
because it is in front of you. When I did my claim I used the
website because it was easier and I do my educational benefits
online as well.

How often do you go online to manage your benefits?

Basically, maybe 2-3 times a year. A lot of it has to do with them reaching out to me for my routine appointments so I go a review my medical records so I know what to talk about because when you get out you try to move past it and not look at but my medical I have to look at.

What do you typically do to manage your benefits online?

5. Do you currently, or have you ever, filed a claim or appeal with the VA?

Yes when it came to my disability I had to file the claim  to get my percentage and that’s when I received the 30%. They diagnosed me with a social disorder because of transitioning back into society was difficult due to fears. I contract latent dico0bris so it wasn’t fully diagnosed for DB but I will carry it with me for the rest of my life.

Okay great, for this next question I'm going to share my screen really
quick.

Moderator share screen with MyVA

5. Do you remember if you have ever used this page on va.gov? 

Yes I have.

If yes: Do you remember what you did? So passing the education benefits I  applied for that and searched for school that the benefits could be used at, tracking the claims so I make sure everything is going well and when it was time for approval I could check on that. I should have appealed now that we are passing the appeals section.

If no: Not a problem at all.

ALTERNATE STARTING WITH VERSIONS A AND B FOR EACH PARTICIPANT

Intro
Okay great.

So, just a little bit of background, today we are going to be talking about a personalized overview page, which is basically where you would go to view all of your recent updates as well as an overview of your health care, benefit or claims information. This page is intended to just be an overview of your information - if you wanted to change or manage any of your information that would be done on another page. Does that make sense?

1. What information would you expect to be on your overview page?

When it comes to the overview page it is outlining what I am doing with the VA. Obviously I would want to see the things I am working on like educational benefits so it would be good to see the status, if I wanted to apply for another claim like the GI bill, VocRehab I would want to see that on there as well. For medical claims, the ability to enter my medical claims to file a claim. That sums it up I think.

Any questions before we get started? 
No.

Okay, so we are going to be comparing two versions of the same page. For the sake of the exercise, please imagine that all of the information shown on the page is your information. And just a reminder, these screens are intentionally grayscale.

We are going to start with version (A or B), and I'll send you the link.

VERSION A
Link:
https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/EDZFDJ7UWTC#/437719085_myVA_Mobile_A

First task: Overview & Updates

Go ahead and scroll through this page and walk me through your thoughts
on each section, starting with where you see your name (Charles) in the dark
grey box.

Nametag area/disability rating

I am assuming Charles is my name or if Washington smith is the location? 

I didn’t know what that was, okay that’s my name and its really long. I have a 40% rating currently and if I have any appeals it wouldn’t have changed. If it goes through the percentage would change either lower or higher. I assume clicking the box would open and provide more details about my rating.

Updates

From the home page I clicked on myVA. There are 4 new updates that I have and they are in grey boxes. I am not sure if they are in order due to importance or not but just looking at it at face value it is information that is important, 3 file requests from the VA for my claim. It is kind of confusing, I don’t know if it waws overlooked or not but it says it was updated on October 5th then here my appointment was cancelled but then I have another appointment on September 14th, I am not sure if that’s a missed but that’s there moving on. I can see that my claim was accepted, I am not to sure when it comes to the dependency claims, maybe it is a type of claim I filed for, I am not to sure on that personally but if I have doubts I can click on it for more information. My appointment as cancelled and If I want to manage or reschedule I can call or go there to take me to a calendar to see what else is available in the near future. I can see I have a message from my doctor, to view it I can click on that. If I have other notifications that didn’t show or I clicked on in the past I can go to recent updated and it will list the notification received in the past.

**Works well:** Just to be able to click within the box to go to the certain section is easy and I don’t need to search the page for the information especially if its my phone because I would be on the go so I don’t need to scroll through a lot if it is for my health or time sensitive. I am not sure the order or importance or if it populated in the order received. If there are only 4 that showed at a time, if it just have the number at the top it would say look at additional updates. I don’t know how it works looking at this.

**What doesn’t work well:**  For simplicity purposes how this one VA appointment was cancelled, maybe say who the doctor is. Obviously you have multiple doctors for different things, I don’t remember my doctors name but if I am aware I would know which appointment and which doctor it was cancelled with so it would save me time from having to manage the appointment and I would know what it was for
and who it was with.

**What updates would be helpful:** You have the basic ones here, anychanges to disability , if a claim were approved, VA appointments for benefits or for the doctor, obviously a message form the doctor is important. That sums it up, everything here is important because it relates to my benefits, educational benefits would be on here as well. 

Time sensitivity things: As it relates to the updates, I would hope to see infomration that is time sensitive be first. There are explanation marks that are important but that is more of hey look at this it is important but its not in an order that I feel would be conducive if you have multiple notification if they have been checked . having the ones with explanation marks or prioritized in a way that is the most important to the person or the doctor eb first. I am sure when the dates may through things out of order so it may be in the order that it was received. Seeing the notifications here 4, but having the recent updates mentioning how many messages received, if I haven’t clicked on them it would be important to see as we’ll. Not seeing those on the screen may cause me more work, then wonder if I had additional updates to have to click and go through them all.

Thoughts: No.


## Claims

There are 4 claims that are in progress and 2 claims being appealed. If there are additional claims to be filed and I can click it here. It is good that it doesn’t mention which claims because medical history is sensitive so you may not want all of your me3dcial history to popup if you are around others. You are able to go somewhere private that you can review that claim.

On a separate page: it would work for me if I am aware that my medical information would be exposed so if I need to go somewhere private I have the ability to do that. 

What is missing: I would say because I am currently at 40% disability, the information for that is at the top so looking at this I would be assuming there are two claims that I am obviously appeals so there are 2 in progress or being adjudicated. There are 6 claims that were filed and 2 were appealed and 4 in progress, that is a lot of claims. Possibly have a section that a claim was denied would eb good so you have a section that have 0 claims disapproved or not approved, that may be something generated after the fact but I am not sure.

## Health care

I can see I have been enrolled since January, have an upcoming appointment on September 14th, there is a section to go to allappointment which can be future and past. Scrolling below I have 4 other upcoming appointments. 2 messages and 3 prescription refills. I can also go here to review results, find a VA, and get my medical records.

What about appointments would be here: Probably who the doctor is who I will be seeing because I can see a message from this doctor but like before who says I don’t have more than one doctor so I may not be aware of that. Having who the doctor is would be helpful or infomration about which office would be helpful if I do not know the doctor so I know which office they are working out of would be useful

What about prescriptions would you want to see: To be honest I am not to sure because I have never done that before. Like I mentioned before having to much private information on one page can be comprising so accessing it by clicking would be helpful. Depending on the amount of medication I am taking, knowing how many refills are needed would be important but I have never had to access the tab before. 

What about messages: I can see I have 2 messages so I would assume it is from doctors due to it being under healthcare. Normally when it comes to online and a cell phone three could eb more infomration accessed by going on a computer so this is more like a one stop shop to see new messages, I wouldn’t expect to see who it is from especially if there is more than one but if you want to take it a step future for prioritization you could have that be within this part as well would be
useful.

Would it work if it were on a separate page, didn’t need the doctors
message but if they were on a separate page: For sure it would work for me because this is a one stop shop to notify me what is available at the time and if I wanted to inquire more I can click on them to access it on another page. Because it is a cellphone and not a tablet a lot of the information must be smaller so to have it quick and to the point is something I prefer.

Overall healthcare: I mean to be honest this covers the main appointments, appointments, messages, prescription refills, accessing the medical history is very useful because you have to click a lot of the times and having it there is important. I can tell you there’s nothing more stressful then click on different tabs to find the medical history but having it there easy to access is useful.

Add or change: I think we covered it for the most part but the priority of appointments, new messages, if something is of high importance have it in red because you only have the baseline colors which are spread out here. Having something in red would be eye catching

Most important thing to see: That I am not going to die for one. I mean everything is important when it comes to healthcare. They don’t tell you the medical infomration because they are bored. Having the appointments, new messages for medical history and prescription refills are all pretty important because it will determine your health tomorrow, the day after or the rest of your life.

Thoughts: none.

## Benefits
The font is all the same, I don’t like it to much because it is easier to
have the titles be bigger. Readability purposes the font could be bigger
for different section. I see have I a 686 in progress, I would assume it
expires on January 20thand it was last open on October 12th Looking at
this is confusing

What is confusing: I guess that last time I opened it was on October 12th but it expired on January 20 th
. Just the dates are confusing for me
because did it expire or will it expired. I think it may have been how it
was created. If it already expired it should say it expired and not have
it was last opened. It is on the same year. I was military intelligence so
I pick all of this out. If I want to access it I can go to the form by
clicking the tab, I also have an application for Vet Tech which is this
form. It expires on December 19
th
and was lasty open in May, I can go
to the form from here as well. I don’t know if the next part is part of it, I
can see other benefits that I am interested in as well.

Anything else confusing: Not really. I mean I have claims here, but I
also have claims here so that is confusing if they should be together or
not. If that is the case maybe have them closer together like the
medical records then the other claims after it so my eyes aren’t going
all over the place.

Other thoughts: just a little bit because I see multiple claims and
appeals in progress. I just coming back to it, it would make sense to
see the other claims in progress for them to be together would be
helpful.

1.
What are your overall thoughts about this page? I like it a lot. It is
straight and to the point, not to much writing or reading. It provides
the ability to access important infomration but not straight when I
access the page so I can go somewhere private to access may medical
information. That is something very beneficial.

2.
What is working?

3.
What is not working? I feel like we talked about a lot but maybe
because it is myVA. The VA is a lot more then just claims and medical
history so having the ability to decide what infomration is on this and
what isn’t, I should be in control of what populates here and what
doesn’t would be beneficial as well.

## Second task: Claims scenario

Okay, great. Now, I'm going to give you a scenario. You've recently
submitted a claim and you are waiting to see if it has been approved. You've
just landed on this page.

Could you walk me through how you would do that? I would want to
see the whole page so I would scroll down, I see that my claim was
accepted and if I wanted to see it all I would click on the claims.
If they look for the update in the updates section:

i.
Why would you expect it to be in this section? Well from the
looks of it this is the page that has to do with claims and
appointments. It is helpful because the information is at the top
so it is the first thing I see when I enter.

ii.
What do you mean information: the claim that I filed.

iii.
What information would you expect to see related to your claim?
Well based on this I would see if my claim were approved/denied,
additional information needed form the VA I would expect to see
here as well. Scrolling down I can see there are 4 claims in
process and 2 appeals. I can see that out of those 4 I am
appealing and 2 that are still open. I see here that the VA is
requesting 3 files so that is good to see as well.

iv.
Easy or hard to find: I would say it is easy because it is the first
thing you see when you enter so it captures my attention and I
like it. It is a good option to have here , it is pretty easy.

v.
What is the most important things to see: Anything that has to
do with my health, education benefits because it is something I
need. It is not something I just want it is what I need and will
affect my future and health so having those are really important.

Third task: Health care scenario
Okay, we're now going to move on to another scenario. Imagine you are
currently enrolled in health care with the VA. You've come to this page to see
when your next appointment is.

1.
Can you walk me through how you would do that? I can see where my
appointment as cancelled for this date/time, the contact number with
questions or concerns, I could click manage the appointment to review
the information and if I need to reschedule I can request a different
date, time.
If they look for appointments in the updates section:

i.
Was it easy or hard to find your upcoming appointment? Because
it is a notification that is telling me that my appointment as
cancelled by the VA and it is grayed out so I can see it is a
notification I need to look into. It is also telling me I have a
message form my doctor so I expect any notification to show up
first.

ii.
What if you had multiple appointments, which would this be:  Let
me look at the rest of the page real quick. So I have an
understand of my appointments, coming down a little lower I can
see that I have an upcoming appointment on September 14th and
I have 4 other appointments that are scheduled as well. So
scrolling up and seeing the appointment date is cancelled I
believe maybe I would know which one this is because I am
aware of the days are schedule for which appointment so I would
know which appointment it was. If I didn’t know you can go to all
appointments to see which appointments are still active and
which was cancelled.

iii.
Easy or hard: It was easy because scrolling down the page it is
right here in big letters, upcoming appointment. I can see the
one that is cancelled and the one on the 14th is still active.
Thoughts: it seems easier sometimes on a  computer it is harder because
there’s more words. Having it simple and straightforward on the cellphone is
good.

Fourth task: Benefits
Skip the fourth task if prototype is shown second
If you could go ahead and scroll down to the section that says, 'Benefit
applications'.

1.
What information is the most important to see about your benefit
applications?

2.
Do you find anything confusing at all?

3.
Is there anything that you would add or change about the benefits
section?

Transitioning between prototypes
Okay great, now let's move onto the second prototype, this is version (A or
B). I'm going to drop another link in the chat.

VERSION B
Link:
https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/HDZFDLY3WEZ#/
437720005_myVA_Mobile_B
First task: Overview
Second task: Claims scenario
Go ahead and click on claims and appeals.
Okay great. Go ahead and go back to the previous screen by clicking 'Claims
and appeals' again. I'm now going to give you a scenario - imagine you are
trying to view all of your claims in progress and you've just landed on this
page.

1.
Could you walk me through how you would do that? It is very short,
alright. So when it comes to knowing more about clicks click on claims
and appeals. I can see there are two updates so I would just click on
that or if I am not sure the down arrow means that the updates will
disappear but if there’s more information that comes up when clicking
that would be good otherwise I would just click on the updates. I would
go to the claims overview and see the claims is progress section. 
If they look for their claims in progress in the claim’s updates section:

i.
Why would you expect it to be in this section? If I am, wondering
which ones are in progress it makes sense to look at the claims
overview and then the claims in progress.

ii.
Easy or hard: I was thinking of that was talking. I mean I would
say that it is harder because claims overview is lower but then
you have ethe updates on the top so it’s just a little strange in
order.

iii.
How to make it less strange:  I am not really sure to be honest
with you. It is a lot of work to access the updates so its like here
it says you have updates and click on it. They come up but there
there’s a lot of other infomration, there’s a lot of clicking. If using
it for the first time you may not know you can access your claims
and appeals by clicking it.

Third task: Health care scenario

Okay, we're now going to move on to another scenario. Imagine you are
currently enrolled in health care with the VA. You've come to this page to see
the latest message from your doctor. Can you walk me through how you
would do that?

1.
Can you walk me through how you would do that? I would close that
then go to healthcare and scroll down to check the newest message.

i.
Was it easy or hard to find your new messages? If we are going
in t4he same other I would say it is easier because I am looking
for a message but looking at healthcare doesn’t say I have
messages just that I have updates. I would think an updated
would be prescription or appointments not a message. Here it
says I have a new message but looking at new messages it says I
have 2 I think if I had two messages there would be another
under the notification if being considered a notification.

ii.
Can you tell me why you think it would be in the health care
section?

iii.

Overall thoughts: I am not a fan of it to be honest because it is a
lot of click without much information and is generalized. It counts
an email as an updated, if I am not worried about updated but I
am for the message I would want to see that. A lot of clicking and
not enough information. I know they are trying to conserve space
and wanting to know the infomration I am looking for with drop
down tabs. To much information under just one small section

iv.
What is working: The infomration that in  included within the
sections. The importance of the information in each section is
important and that is something I appreciate.

Comparison

Thanks so much! If you could go ahead and stop sharing your screen. Let's
take a look at versions A and B side-by-side.
Moderator shares screen and pulls upside by side screens

1.
Overall, which prototype do you prefer? Why? I prefer version a, it is
better because it highlights everything from the start that I feel is
important. It is less work to look for what I am trying to find and is
more specific what inforamtion is discussed. Like I said before
healthcare it says updates and email so an email isn’t an update but
that’s just my preference.

2.
Do you prefer to see updates at the top of the screen or collapsed in
each section?

3.
How did these pages meet your expectations? Assuming the information is important it would be accessible to me even though I
wasn’t a fan with version b I was more attracted to version a

4.
How did these pages not meet your expectations? To be more specific
to priority to the information so if it needs to stand out to me then it
would be like hey look at this not hey you have an update. 

5.
Do you think you would or would not use this page when you log in to
VA.gov?  I would use version A because it is a one stop shop like my
claims, medical and cases are important to me. So having easy access
instead of the VA sending me stuff and the time it takes on my phone,
easy access to the information on my own time without jumping
through hoops is important to me.
6.
What would you call this page? I don’t know, I think my VA is
something that is appropriate because I have ethe ability to design
myVA how I want and to highlight want is important to me. I think that
would be a great option because having My in it shows ownership so it
shows that I am in control and not the VA>
7.

Any other thoughts?

Wrap-up and close

Okay, thank you so much! Those are all of the questions that I had for you
today, do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?
Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us
today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site
and make sure it really works for Veterans.
Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
