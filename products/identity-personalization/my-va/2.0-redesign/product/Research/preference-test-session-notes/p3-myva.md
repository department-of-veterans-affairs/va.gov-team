Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

1.
Before we look at the website, can you tell me a little about yourself?
Retired navy, computer geek, not much web development so this is
interesting
o

If stuck: What branch did you serve in?

2.
What type of phone do you use? How do you typically use your phone
versus your desktop if you have one? It is a 1=t, from about a year and
a half ago.

3.
Do you currently, or have you ever, received any benefits from the VA?
Just my retirement stuff.
o

If yes: How do you manage your benefits online? I should say no
because it shows up but I don’t pay attention besides tax time.
How often do you go online to manage your benefits?
When needed. Less often then within the year.

What do you typically do to manage your benefits online?
Last time it was va. Something I don’t think it was va.gov
but myVA. Honestly Generally  it is when someone needs
me to verify address or numbers, minor stuff. 

4.
Do you currently, or have you ever, filed a claim or appeal with the VA?
Only when I was retiring.

Okay great, for this next question I'm going to share my screen really
quick.

Moderator share screen with MyVA

5.
Do you remember if you have ever used this page on va.gov? Yes
o

If yes: Do you remember what you did? About a year ago ish, I
moved my provider form the VA clinic that was 15 miles away,
there was a clinic within a mile and had to login to fix the
paperwork mistakes and I didn’t have a provider, they didn’t
know I was alive. It was fixed within 10 minutes once I spoke with
them.

ALTERNATE STARTING WITH VERSIONS A AND B FOR EACH
PARTICIPANT

Intro

Okay great.

So, just a little bit of background, today we are going to be talking about a
personalized overview page, which is basically where you would go to view
all of your recent updates as well as an overview of your health care, benefit
or claims information. This page is intended to just be an overview of your
information - if you wanted to change or manage any of your information
that would be done on another page. Does that make sense? Yupp.

1.
What information would you expect to be on your overview page?
Basic status really, any upcoming appointment, current in progress
things.

2.
What about basic status: like eligibility, how they identity me, like
where I am. Then status on the ongoing claims or new items.

Any questions before we get started?

Okay, so we are going to be comparing two versions of the same page. For
the sake of the exercise, please imagine that all of the information shown on
the page is your information. And just a reminder, these screens are
intentionally grayscale.

We are going to start with version (A or B), and I'll send you the link.

First task: Overview & Updates

Go ahead and scroll through this page and walk me through your thoughts
on each section, starting with where you see your name (Charles) in the dark
grey box.

Nametag area/disability rating

I see name, and current rating which is cool because I keep forgetting
to look at mine.

Updates
The first block has 3 files needed for the VA, it has 3 actions running
and if I click go to claim it would take me to it instead of the pother. If
there are 3 file requests they may be bulleted instead, I don’t know if
there would be many with it but I wouldn’t be surprised if there are at
all times but on the other hand I haven’t filed anything since retiring. I
don’t know if it needs to be broken out because I don’t know how many
times it happens.

Honestly, I like it and it is straightforward. There is a hyperlink at the
bottom to take you to the relating section. I don’t know if you need
messages broken out I cannot remember on a PC if there’s a link but it
is not a bad thing to have it write there.

What does not work well: The only thing I can think of is if they are
going to put a new message then you don’t need the x to close it .

What updated are important: the current list is good I cannot think of
anything else to pout there

What infomration would you be looking for: Pretty much what you
have. You claim is accepted, if it is accepted or in progress there is an
assumpti9on I would know which claim because I started it and as long
as there is a hyperlink then this being short is okay because I can go to
the page talking about it.

All recent updated to where: A expanded version of all of the updates
such as 10 for each section for by time. Showing the last quarter or 6
months’ worth of stuff.

Suggestions for updated: No.

Claims

Information expected: on the page they are keeping it simple so I don’t
see anything else there but if I click the side carrot it will have text or
hyperlink or take me to a different page with breakdowns with
information. I don’t mind either way

Infomration missing in this section: Well maybe a link for filing an
appeal if that is different then filing a claim.

What is not working: I like it like this so I don’t have anything that is
not working.

Health care
I see an appointment that has been cancelled. This is a pretty nice
screen.

All messages are under healthcare and I thought of the appointments
and healthcare as separate, I don’t think you need enrolled since. I like
the next appointment; would it show multiple fi you have more. I would
expect it to show anything you do have scheduled just in case, same
thing for upcoming appointments, messages, and prescriptions in a
new page but appointments would be good to be listed because you
may forget.

Most important to see: Honestly, I use the va for shots annually but I
don’t know I would defer to the medical community on that one.
Appointment infomration to be seen. Just what you already have on the
box but adding in the point of contact or whoever is scheduling the
appointment. Who what when why.

Prescription information: yeah that may be a good thing just with a pop
out box with refills with a kick out what you are taking every day.
Messages: Honestly because there is a new message at top, they could
be brough together then have a kickout to all new messages. Either
way here or up further just having it noted is good. I don’t really care
which way.

Infomration wanting to add: no, if you do a prescription box with what
you take and what you have for refills would be nice.

Benefit applications

Looks like I have to applications in process, those are in process
applications.

Confusing: Yes because it looks like it goes to a form not a claim.,

Where do you expect it to go: I think it will take me to the form and not
the claim info. Is this an in process claim or submitted.
What would you change: clarity in the verbiage
What is important: status and deadline.

1.
What are your overall thoughts about this page? It looks clean and
simple. I like the grey boxes to separate things. It looks very useable. I
like the shortcut link with a side carrot, it is annoying when websites do
not list what an opening link is.

2.
What is working? I like the name and rating on top, updates on top.
Every section is clearly labeled and hyper link are correctly colors. I
hate when they are not list properly.

3.
What is not working? Honestly, I don’t see things that aren’t working
but the enrolled in healthcare since January, who cares. Other than
that I like that.\

4.
What would you suggest placing there instead: Maybe list the type of
healthcare that are able to have such as vision and dental since they
are not a given.

5.
Click on disability: to a landing page that will break down what it is like
10 percent of shoulder or whatever it would be.

Skip question 4 if prototype is shown second

4.
If you clicked on the disability rating, where would you expect that to
go?

Okay, now let's take a look at the updates section.

1.
Can you describe to me what you're looking at?

2.
What kind of updates would be helpful to you?

3.
If you clicked on 'Go to all recent updates' where would you expect
that to go?
4.
What works well?
5.
What doesn't work well?

Second task: Claims scenario

Okay, great. Now, I'm going to give you a scenario. You've recently
submitted a claim and you are waiting to see if it has been approved. You've
just landed on this page.

1.
Could you walk me through how you would do that? Looking for a claim
I would scroll down here and click file requests because that jumps out
at me but then down here it has claims and appeals
2.

Why there: because it is a new claim so it is in progress and the
kickout for in progress claims are the active ones. There is always
backspace.

Third task: Health care scenario

Okay, we're now going to move on to another scenario. Imagine you are
currently enrolled in health care with the VA. You've come to this page to see
when your next appointment is.

1.
Can you walk me through how you would do that? I would expect this
appointment has been cancelled to have the next one but if not I would
scroll down to the appointments.

2.
Live in the appointment canceled, why: I assume that is the next
appointment update thing so it should be there but this one is
canceled. That one has been cancelled but after that has pasted it will
go to the new one.
If they look for appointments in the updates section:

i.

Was it easy or hard to find your upcoming appointment? I found
it easy because it is prominent and at the top of the page. This
would be a good place to do a kickout to the calendar or
hyperlink.

VERSION B

Link:
https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/HDZFDLY3WEZ#/
437720005_myVA_Mobile_B

First task: Overview

Take a look at this page and let me know your thoughts starting with where
you see your name (Charles).

This is much more condensed definitely. Honestly, I kind of like that it says
your updates and you can click on it to list them all. I think I like that better
because it is less details. The other one is 2-3 so you would have to scroll
and I am a fan of people not needing to scroll much

Nametag area/disability rating

Claims and appeals/updates
What updated do you want here: all in progress and documents stuff

Health care/updates
Should have all of the healthcare infomration/access.
The appointment was cancelled so it should take me somewhere to
manage it or a kickout calendar would be nice. The prescription would
be nice and the note instead of it just at the va.

Benefit applications
1.

What are your overall thoughts about this page?

2.
What is working? You can get all of the infomration on one page
without much movement. I like the elements are obvious. I am used to
a down carrot as a down menu but put it in a circle to make it more
obviously

3.
What is not working? Nothing on this screen those are the same
complaint. I like the simplicity
Skip question 4 if prototype is shown second
4.
If you clicked on the disability rating, where would you expect that to
go?
Second task: Claims scenario
Go ahead and click on claims and appeals.

1.
What are your thoughts about this section? 3 files needed and it looks
like I requested multiple things. The go to click would take me to the
higher claim and I don’t know if the other is the same or subset so I
don’t know if they should have their own entirely. The other one tells
me that the claim was accepted so I added someone to the family.

2.
Is there anything that you would add or change about this section?

3.
If you clicked on 'Go to recent claims updates' where would you expect
that to go? I would assume it would be a list that would be under the
claims and appeals over the past 4-6 months to a longer list other then
the just recent.

4.
What works well: I like that it is simple. If you want knee deep to go to
the claim, this page should be very short and simple like here it is and
this is your step if anything.

5.
Doesn’t work well: I have nothing to add.

Okay great. Go ahead and go back to the previous screen by clicking 'Claims
and appeals' again. I'm now going to give you a scenario - imagine you are
trying to view all of your claims in progress and you've just landed on this
page.

1.
Could you walk me through how you would do that? All, basically if it
past the updates I feel like I would open this and go to recent claims.
2.

Why: because those are things that are further back then recent
claims.
If they look for their claims in progress in the claim’s updates section:

i.
Why would you expect it to be in this section?

ii.
What information would you expect to see related to your claim?
In the update, things that are newly changed but the recent
would be chronologically list. Anything that has had a status
change, approved, not approved.
Third task: Health care scenario
Okay, we're now going to move on to another scenario. Imagine you are
currently enrolled in health care with the VA. You've come to this page to see
the latest message from your doctor. Can you walk me through how you
would do that?

1.
Can you walk me through how you would do that? It would be under
healthcare and under a new message, the view message would take to
the actual inbox.

2.
Why there: if it is in the new message then it should be here if you
don’t have a separate inbox.
If they look for messages in the health care updates section:

i.
Was it easy or hard to find your new messages? It was easy
because it is under healthcare but having a button that you have
new messages would be good for other people.

ii.
Thoughts: no. other than message notification button or graphic
would be cool but I like the smaller design.

Comparison

Thanks so much! If you could go ahead and stop sharing your screen. Let's
take a look at versions A and B side-by-side.
Moderator shares screen and pulls up side by side screens

1.
Overall, which prototype do you prefer? Why? I prefer b. once again I
don’t like scrolling.
2.
Do you prefer to see updates at the top of the screen or collapsed in
each section? Other than messages I like it collapsed but healthcare
messages May need a blurb or button of their own.

3.
How did these pages meet your expectations? I don’t have
expectations, they both met them by providing all information and
being readable. I don’t have a probable wither either one

4.
How did these pages not meet your expectations? No notes.

5.
Do you think you would or would not use this page when you log in to
VA.gov? Why? Definitely use it because it will most likely be the
landing page and it had good summary pages.

6.
More useful for you: Not that I can think of.

7.
What would you call this page? Landing page.

8.
Any other thoughts?
