Conversation Guide for MyVA

Intro - 5 minutes

Start recording.

I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I
record my screen and the audio as we talk today? Yes

Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

1.
Before we look at the website, can you tell me a little about yourself? I
served in the navy back in 2015 was when I joined, not in anymore and
I am a stay at home mom with 2 kids and a full time student.

2.
What type of phone do you use? How do you typically use your phone
versus your desktop if you have one? I have an iPhone it is an older
phone fi don’t know which one there’s to many of them. I use my
phone way more and the only time I use a laptop is for school but I use
my phone for pretty much everything.

3.
Do you currently, or have you ever, received any benefits from the VA?
I currently do. I receive 10% for my hip, I hurt it in bootcamp and it got
worse when I was in. I am not sure exactly but I get VA healthcare for
my mental health and can use the VA for those services.
How often do you go online to manage your benefits? I
don’t think so I think the last time I looked was when I was
approved.

Do you remember doing that:  It was kind of a little
confusing, I had to go on my husbands recently and it was
a little hard to find the disability and the proof of disability.
What site: I believe it was ebenfits.

4.
Do you currently, or have you ever, filed a claim or appeal with the VA?
No I have not.

Okay great, for this next question I'm going to share my screen really
quick.

Moderator share screen with MyVA

5.
Do you remember if you have ever used this page on va.gov? Yes I
have.
o

If yes: Do you remember what you did? It probably was for
tracking my claim waiting to see its approval. I think to see, I
don’t know. It looks familiar I know I tracked my claim but I am
not sure if I used it to get into the claim.

ALTERNATE STARTING WITH VERSIONS A AND B FOR EACH
PARTICIPANT

Intro

Okay great.

So, just a little bit of background, today we are going to be talking about a
personalized overview page, which is basically where you would go to view
all of your recent updates as well as an overview of your health care, benefit
or claims information. This page is intended to just be an overview of your
information - if you wanted to change or manage any of your information
that would be done on another page. Does that make sense? Yes it does.

1.

What information would you expect to be on your overview page? I
would probably see my disability I am assuming, maybe something
about healthcare. I am not sure.

2.

Thoughts: No, I am just not sure. My situation is tricky because I know I
don’t have the GI bill so I think it would just be the disability.
Any questions before we get started?  No, I don’t think so.

Okay, so we are going to be comparing two versions of the same page. For
the sake of the exercise, please imagine that all of the information shown on
the page is your information. And just a reminder, these screens are
intentionally grayscale.

We are going to start with version (A or B), and I'll send you the link.

First task: Overview & Updates

Go ahead and scroll through this page and walk me through your thoughts
on each section, starting with where you see your name (Charles) in the dark
grey box.

Nametag area/disability rating-  I like how right away you see3 the
disability rating so if you are waiting for it to change you see it.

Updates- It instantly jumps to updated so that’s nice you don’t have to
look for them

Claims- They have all of the claims, I really like this. There is
everything you need to see up top

Health care- It has your appointments
Benefit applications-  All of the forms you’d need to make contact

1.
What are your overall thoughts about this page? I like it because it will
be easy to use/. Right off the bat you see the disability at the top./ IT
seems like it would be easy to use because there are updates and all
appointments are right there. It is easy and straightforward.

2.
What is working?

3.
What is not working? I don’t know, I like it. I don’t think there isn’t
anything that wouldn’t work. It is straightforward. I don’t think me
personally would have any issues.

Skip question 4 if prototype is shown second

4.

If you clicked on the disability rating, where would you expect that to
go? The next screen would say the percent and break it down like for
10% for shoulder. I don’t know each breakdown of the things you
claimed.

Okay, now let's take a look at the updates section.

1.
Can you describe to me what you're looking at?

2.
What kind of updates would be helpful to you? I think anything to do
with disability, claims, any appointments, or messages from your
doctor. I imagine it to be just like that it would be perfect.

3.
If you clicked on 'Go to all recent updates' where would you expect
that to go?

4.
What works well? I like that it tells you up to the number of updates.
Then you can click on the claim and go right to it, it allows you to know
the acc3epted claims, messages, and everything you can click to go
directly to it. I like they have individual links.

5.
What doesn't work well? No, I like it. I think it is straightforward and go
to things that are to the point.

6.
Improvements: Maybe more detail about the file requests but I think it
will do that if you click on it or that would be nice. It has the
appointment date but not what it is about. It would be nice to see what
the appointment is so you know why it was canc3elled.

7.
Rece3nt updated: I think it would take you to the next page about all of
the updates you received or a data log about what you have already
seen. It would be removed from here about be on the updates page.

8.
Questions: I think it is straightforward, I like it.
Second task: Claims scenario
Okay, great. Now, I'm going to give you a scenario. You've recently
submitted a claim and you are waiting to see if it has been approved. You've
just landed on this page.

1.
Could you walk me through how you would do that?
If they look for the update in the updates section:

i.
Why would you expect it to be in this section?

ii.
What information would you expect to see related to your claim?
Maybe if they needed any more information or documents to be
completed when you click that it will tell you if they need
anything or if it has been accepted/denied. Any update like that I
assume. 

iii.
Where would you look:
If they look for the update in the claims section:

iv.
Why would you expect it to be in this section?
Skip questions 2 and 3 if prototype is shown second

v.
What information would you expect to see related to your claims
and appeals here? The claims and progress link, I would assume
it would tell me anything I know for each claim.

vi.
What information is missing in this section? More details, I could
easy scroll by this. If I talked to someone from the VA and they
told me they sent me something. I wouldn’t know that it would
be in one of those folders I guess.

vii.
Additional details here: All of the claims, individual claims then
all of the progress and appeals would be there. I am assuming
that if they needed more paperwork from you that may be in
there.

viii.
Lives on another page or here: On another page, you would click
the progress claims and it would take you to another page.

ix.
For this page, you expect it to take you to another page with
more details but on this page would you want more details even
though it lives elsewhere: Yes, if something was updated within
the claims, it would be like click here due to new information.
Otherwise I would scroll by this because there’s nothing that
jumps out. It blends in with the screen.

x.
Claims updated, do you want to see it in the update section and
the claims or just one: I think both personally. I would like to see
it at the top just in case I exit out of it. I need something that
marks in red that there is an update.

Third task: Health care scenario

Okay, we're now going to move on to another scenario. Imagine you are
currently enrolled in health care with the VA. You've come to this page to see
when your next appointment is.

1.
Can you walk me through how you would do that?  How long you are
enroll but for me it would be nice to see what coveragte3 I have like
hear, vision or something that indicates what is in there.

2.
On this page or another detailed page: I would like to see it right there,
if this is my overview page I can look and be like yes I have that
healthcare coverage.

If they look for appointments in the updates section:

i.
Was it easy or hard to find your upcoming appointment?

ii.
Can you tell me why you think it would be in the updates
section?

Skip questions 3-4 if prototype is shown second

iii.
What information would you expect to be included for your
appointments? I like how it is the most recent one is bigger, then
the other upcoming ones. Maybe more details, I don’t know if it is
vague because it’s a prototype but I would expect to see what
the appointment is for. My personal healthcare does that.

iv.
Details, can you explain: In the square where it says the
date/time. Maybe being to see what VA location it is at with the
doctor and for what such as general practice or vision. Just more
detail it is vague.

v.
What detail would be the most important: it would be a tied
between location and date/time. I don’t know if you have
different buildings but the location and date/time is important to
ensure you are there on time.

vi.
Is there anything that you would add or change about the
appointments section?

vii.
Prescription: the pharmacy and a link to refill it if it needs to be
refilled.

viii.
What if it lived somewhere else: That would be fine because it
tells there are 3 prescription refiles so I think all of the
information I would need would be there

ix.
Most important detail for it: how many refills you have left.
Someone with mental health issues you cannot run out so
knowing or an alert to let you know there’s 1 left would be good.

x.
Updates for prescription where would it be: I would hope it would
be at the updates or under healthcare it would let you know. Or
an individual under prescription refills it would alert you to a low
number of refills.

If they look for appointments in the health care section:

Most important
: I would hope that if my appointment needed
reschedule or anything. I don’t know.

xi.
Was it easy or hard to find your upcoming appointment?

xii.
Can you tell me why you think it would be in the health care
section?
Skip questions 3-4 if prototype is shown second

xiii.
What information would you expect to see on this page related
to your appointments? Any messages from the doctor would be
there, any updates that you have like blood work came back.
Maybe even prescription refills could be there. Any news,
especially with COVID. Like if no guests can come with you that
would be better.

xiv.
Is there anything that you would add or change about the
appointments section?
Okay great, thank you.
Skip questions 1-5 if prototype is shown second

1.
What information would you expect to see related to your health care
here? A bit more in depth about the healthcare you have like
prescription only or have dental. That would be nice. Really just the
little boxes for message, appointments , something in red when it is
added would be good. I wouldn’t think to look there unless I knew
there was going to be something added.

2.
What information related to your prescriptions do you expect to see on
this page?

3.
What information related to your messages do you expect to see on
this page?

4.
Can you look over all of the information shown here, is there anything
that you would add?

5.
Confusing: I have so many people to look at is confusing because of
how it only says va appointments. Everything else is labeled well and I
know what to expect when clicking the link.

6.
How could it be less confusion: I meant in the fact I haven’t started to
use my V Healthcare yet. If there are more than one person there I
would want more detail but I guess it would just be me and not my kids
in there.

Fourth task: Benefits

Skip the fourth task if prototype is shown second

If you could go ahead and scroll down to the section that says, 'Benefit
applications'.

When I see this it is applications I just put in and it is straightforward because
it tells me last open like when I looked at it and I like how it tells me when it
expires./ I assume if you click go to form it will tell you more in depth
information like the progress or when I did my claim it would tell you the
estimated time.

1.
What information is the most important to see about your benefit
applications?  When it expires so you know if it is coming up close so
you can dig in if it is coming up but then what it is for so you know
exactly what form you are looking for and what it is.

2.
Forms already submitted: Yes, I assume it was submitted ebcuase3
how I expect if I didn’t submit it would say continue with another link
that says finish your application. So yes I would assume it was finished.

3.
Do you find anything confusing at all? I didn’t until you brought up if
they were submitted. Someone could get confused if it is not finished it
would need click here to finish or something to indicate that it hasn’t
been submitted. If I went back I would think it was submitted.

4.
Is there anything that you would add or change about the benefits
section? Like I said if it isn’t finished just an indicated like click to finish
or where you last left off. It would take you to exactly where you
stopped like FASFA you can click right where you left off.
scenario: I would look at the updates and just click on the claim that I knew
which I was waiting on. The update section is perfect I would look there first
for any updates. If the box weren’t there I would go to claims in progress and
it would take me to the page to see the updates if it were looked at or
denied.

Why updates first: I figured anything new would be there. Even if it hasn’t
been accepted I would expect it to be there so I know I need to look at it or
sign it. I feel like it is the main hub I would always check there first and if I
don’t see anything I would look farther.

Anything new: If I logged in I would expect any new updates on it there like
approved, denied or more paperwork to be there. Like when you get a new
email notification, it would all be in one spot.

i.
Why would you expect it to be in this section? I imagine it would
be there and if there were more information needed like all of
the dependents that have been accepted like my kids but not my
husband then how much you receive or percentage. I would like
to know more detail about what is there.

ii.
More detail: Probably not helpful, I would want to know more
information.

iii.
What do you mean, in the notification or link: When you click on
it, if someone wanted more details on a separate page with all
details is good. Its wont crowd the updates section but if you
want more then you could click on it.

2.

New scenario for appointments

How would you do it: I would start to scroll down and see that an
appointment was cancelled, I would click manage appointments to see
if I could reschedule or why it was cancelled. If nothing is there I would
go to the healthcare section to see my appointments for past and
present would be under there.

Easy or hard: on this page it would be pretty easy.

Why: when you go to healthcare the nest one is big and then it is easy
to see the link for all appointments. It is a different color so I know it is
a link so I would click it to go to all of my appointments.
Thoughts: more details is certain spots. This is pretty easy to
understand but I am detail oriented so more details in the sections I
mentions but otherwise it is eased to use.

What information

Transitioning between prototypes

Okay great, now let's move onto the second prototype, this is version (A or
B). I'm going to drop another link in the chat.


VERSION B
Link:
https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/HDZFDLY3WEZ#/
437720005_myVA_Mobile_B

First task: Overview

Take a look at this page and let me know your thoughts starting with where
you see your name (Charles).

I already don’t like it because you have to click on each one. It lets know
there are details but this one is more closed off and you have to do more
digging instead of it right in your face.

Other thoughts: I don’t know I just don’t like it I like he other one better it
was more laid out.

What works: Right at the top it tells you your disability rating, the option that
they close so it makes less scrolling if everything is closes. Maybe what I
would like that it says like this up with the updates section. I know it lets you
know there are updates but I like them on the top on the other page.

What updates on this layout: It tells you want each on is, so I know under
claims there are 2 and for healthcare there are 3 but I don’t know what it is
for unless I click on it. It would mean multiple things.

Nametag area/disability rating

Claims and appeals/updates: It lets me know that I filed for 3 and one
has been accepted and it lets me know which are in progress and
which are being appeals.

What works well: It should the updates so you don’t have to
search to far, I would know I have the claim updates.

What doesn’t work well: I don’t know, for me personally I don’t like the
folder type thing. I liked when it was already there and open.

Health care/updates: It lets me know I have appointment cancelled;
prescription filled. It shows messages as well. I really like that it tells
you what prescription as filled so I like that, maybe if this pops up in
the other so you know which one was refilled in the notifications that
would be good. I like that part.

Second task: Claims scenario
Go ahead and click on claims and appeals.

1.
What are your thoughts about this section?  I would go to claims and
appeals and go to recent updates. If that weren’t there I would know to
click on claims in progress so I would look there.

2.
Is there anything that you would add or change about this section?

3.
If you clicked on 'Go to recent claims updates' where would you expect
that to go?

Okay great. Go ahead and go back to the previous screen by clicking 'Claims
and appeals' again. I'm now going to give you a scenario - imagine you are
trying to view all of your claims in progress and you've just landed on this
page.

3.

Third task: Health care scenario

Okay, we're now going to move on to another scenario. Imagine you are
currently enrolled in health care with the VA. You've come to this page to see
the latest message from your doctor. Can you walk me through how you
would do that?

1.
Can you walk me through how you would do that? I would click on the
healthcare and I would expect it to be in the updates like it is but if I
didn’t see that I would go to the new messages and click there.

2.
Why the update section: I would assume it would be there because it is
an important update to know you have an unread emssage3 for the
doctor.

i.
Was it easy or hard to find your new messages?

ii.
Can you tell me why you think it would be in the updates

applications?

2.
Do you find anything confusing at all?

3.
Is there anything that you would add or change about the benefits
section?

Transitioning between prototypes

Okay great, now let's move onto the second prototype, this is version (A or B). I'm going to drop another link in the chat.

Comparison

Thanks so much! If you could go ahead and stop sharing your screen. Let's take a look at versions A and B side-by-side. Moderator shares screen and pulls up side by side screens

1.
Overall, which prototype do you prefer? Why? I really do lean toward A
I know B is trying to clean it up by closing it into a file. I really liked A
because I didn’t need to click anything, the updates were all there. 
Maybe on B keep it open and close but the updates all be right there.
Normally it is the reason you are coming on the page is for the updates
so it makes it easier if it is all right there.

2.
How did these pages meet your expectations? They both really do but I
like one over the other. They were both easy and self-explanatory. SO I
can click where I need to go and there is everything there. If I am going
on I want it to be as easy as possible because the things you file for
isn’t always easy.

3.
How did these pages not meet your expectations?  Some of the area as
I pointed out just more details and I didn’t like the feel of the second
one because of the small boxes. But really just the small details would
make it 100 % for me.

4.
Most important details: The prescriptions for me because that is a big
thing because you need to be on top of it . Then anything with the
claims, they are hand in hand for the most important. The claims is
how you get the benefits or why you are on the claims.

5.
Do you think you would or would not use this page when you log in to
VA.gov? I would use it because it seems really easy to understand and
it feels like it would go smoother so I would get it done faster because
it is all laid out and I wouldn’t spend much time and I wouldn’t spend
as much time looking for what I need.

6.
What would you call this page? I would call it the home screen; it is the
homepage because everything it there and I would call it my home
screen.

7.

Any other thoughts?

Wrap-up and close

Okay, thank you so much! Those are all of the questions that I had for you
today, do you have any questions for me before we wrap up? No I don’t.
Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us
today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site
and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
