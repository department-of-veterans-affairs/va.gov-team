Conversation Guide for MyVA

Intro - 5 minutes

Start recording.

I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I
record my screen and the audio as we talk today? Yes.

Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

1.
Before we look at the website, can you tell me a little about yourself?
I am 39 years old, a marine veteran 90 percent
disability mainly for PTSD and MST. Single part3ent with a 15 year old
with medical issues, I take care of my parents. I don’t do much else
besides taking care of my family and I am not currently working
because everyone in the house is high risk.

2.
What type of phone do you use? How do you typically use your phone
versus your desktop if you have one? It is a 1 plus 7 McLaren.  I use my
phone 95 percent of the time.

3.
Do you currently, or have you ever, received any benefits from the VA?
I see plenty of va doctors, my therapist weekly, followed my the TBI
and neurologist, ENT, GYN, regular primary care, and a few other
specialists in there.
o

If yes: How do you manage your benefits online? I go on my
HealtheVet at least weekly, being a nurse I read my notes
because being a female they mess up my stuff often. Most of the
time they put MR. or married when I am not. I have had my
weight be 100 pound difference in one note.   I check
appointments, do refiles, talk to my doctors in secure messaging,
waiting for claims to go through, I haven’t gotten much over to
the more secure site where you can file the claim but I check my
claim through myhealthevet but I go to va,gov.

How often do you go online to manage your benefits?

What do you typically do to manage your benefits online?

Okay great, for this next question I'm going to share my screen really
quick.

Moderator share screen with MyVA

5.

Do you remember if you have ever used this page on va.gov? Yes
o

If yes: Do you remember what you did? The track claims part
when you click on it you can see where the claims are and what
step you are on. I have been on that part.

ALTERNATE STARTING WITH VERSIONS A AND B FOR EACH PARTICIPANT

Intro

Okay great.

So, just a little bit of background, today we are going to be talking about a
personalized overview page, which is basically where you would go to view
all of your recent updates as well as an overview of your health care, benefit
or claims information. This page is intended to just be an overview of your
information - if you wanted to change or manage any of your information
that would be done on another page. Does that make sense? Yeah.

1.
What information would you expect to be on your overview page? Your
name, address, number, next of kin, email, and their said info.

Any questions before we get started?

Okay, so we are going to be comparing two versions of the same page. For
the sake of the exercise, please imagine that all of the information shown on
the page is your information. And just a reminder, these screens are
intentionally grayscale.

We are going to start with version (A or B), and I'll send you the link.

VERSION A

Link:
https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/EDZFDJ7UWTC#/437719085_myVA_Mobile_A

First task: Overview & Updates

skipped

Second task: Claims scenario

Okay, great. Now, I'm going to give you a scenario. You've recently
submitted a claim and you are waiting to see if it has been approved. You've
just landed on this page.

1.
Could you walk me through how you would do that? You claim has
been accepted, there is a check mark and that it was accepted for the
526. So, I guess it has been approved, I don’t know if accepted and
approved is the same thing. I would click go to claim and see what it
says. If it all the way through so there is not too much that needs to be
proved you just need to send in a birth certificated they are either alive
or dead so they accepted it so I assume it is approved

If they look for the update in the updates section:

i.

Why would you expect it to be in this section? It says there was 4
new updated and it is before the bold print of appeal/claims. It is
not under claims in progress but it could be who knows. Here it
says dependency claim and applications and it has form 686 and
this one is 526. They are two different claims.

ii.
What information would you expect to see related to your claim?
That it was accepted, approved and the date and when it would
end depending what it is. If adding a child I would expect to see
the date it would end as well and if I were putting in that my
child passed, I would expect to see that I stopped getting
benefits for this child which is the date of death.

iii.

Easy or hard: it was easy because it was under updates.

If they look for the update in the claims section:

iv.
Why would you expect it to be in this section?

Third task: Health care scenario

Okay, we're now going to move on to another scenario. Imagine you are
currently enrolled in health care with the VA. You've come to this page to see
when your next appointment is.

1.

Can you walk me through how you would do that? So I scroll down, I see my September 12 th
appointment was cancelled. I would pass that and see my September 14th appointment. I would assume my next appointment is the 14 th because the 12 th was cancelled and the upcoming appointment would be my very next on. Unless you are my
counselor that doesn’t put it in central booking and just send the
telehealth link which just makes it even more confusing. It doesn’t say
with who or where so I would have to go to the infomration desk.

2.

Anything else missing: it doesn’t say where the appointments or who it
is with. It just says VA appointment not that it is at the main VA or the
COBC.  You could maybe click manage appointment and see where it is
for the information.

If they look for appointments in the updates section:

i.

Was it easy or hard to find your upcoming appointment? It was
easy because it is under the bold words upcoming appointments
and you don’t need to click everywhere.

ii.

Can you tell me why you think it would be in the updates
section?

3.

Overall thoughts: I like it. I was going over the benefits, claims/appeals.
I think claims and appeals should go down with benefits applications
not upcoming appointments between because they kind of go more
together. I am guessing that claims/appeals would have the grey boxes
if there’s something important there. Where it says 4 new updates, I
forget by the time I get down to the subsections what the updates are,
I think they should be on the top of the subs3ections. Then the
subsections update for appointment why isn’t that p in the grey area.

4.
What works well about this page: I like that you have the updates in a
different color but I think they should be under the subcategory. I think
people would understand at that time it is an update.

5.
Anything that doesn’t work well: It is really long. I know the other one
was to but this one has a lot of scrolling and there are a lot of different
size boxes to click on. It is not as streamlined as the other one.

6.
Other thoughts: I forgot to mention under healthcare there should be a
tab for wellness. Like the dash diet or how to lose weight type of thing.
People like to click on things to explore. Even if it may not pertain to
them if they click on something for wellness and it says how to lose
more weight, this is our move program. They may be interested in
signing up for it.

Transitioning between prototypes
Okay great, now let's move onto the second prototype, this is version (A or
B). I'm going to drop another link in the chat.

VERSION B

Link:
https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/HDZFDLY3WEZ#/
437720005_myVA_Mobile_B

First task: Overview

Take a look at this page and let me know your thoughts starting with where
you see your name (Charles).

Thoughts here: It is very streamline. I don’t know if that is his whole
name. I like that it tells you the updates within their sections, a lot of
time I go in and am like where am I going. Then on the bottom it is the
same thing. I like that it is stream like, and with the updates on there,
then it is sized down to the page. Mine doesn’t always do that. It
automatically has the disability rating, I like that.

Overall thoughts: I like how streamline it is especially with healthcare
there are a few spots to click on it, then you can get the lab results, get
m3edical records and find va. I like how the applications are also under
the healthcare. I think it is important to have the messages whereas
the claims/appeals headlines, I would capitalize the a on appeals but I
do like how it has the updates so you know t0o click on it to check. I
like the disability rating that they are at right on the top so you don’t
need to go further on the top to see if it was increased. It would be
nice to click on it and see where you are working on the claim.

Where: 40% rating, if you click on it and say you were in the middle of
working on a claim if you could see where you were on working on a
claim  that would be cool or have the ability to sign it. I8 know right
now you have to go further into a more secure login. If you are on my
HealtheVet you have to click on claims and benefits and you have to
get a text code for secure login so you have to login again to get a text
code. If this is coming up now, if you click on the 40% if it did it from
there that would be good. IF it took you automatically to the text or
email code thing. I hate that if you are already signed in you have to
sign in again to get a message code.

How is it streamline: It is straight, the home, myVA, then the straight
line, header, and straight line. You have the dropdowns now, on my
HealtheVet it has the big blue boxes, they are okay. I don’t want to say
it isn’t pretty much this is easier to see where each thing is. This is
easier for people with eye issues just having the line and then a
dropdown. I like the arrow down instead o0f the plus sign near contact
us, the colors are hard to see with eye issues. The blues are harder to
see rather then the white background with a grey line and the arrow
being a different color.

Nametag area/disability rating

Claims and appeals/updates

What would you expect here: I would like to see that it was moved to
the next step or that the VA finally sent in some files, appointment
scheduled, up for review. Any of those.

What is working well: I like the way that it is. These colors with the box
and the white in between you can see the difference. Good color
difference, I am big on that because I have eye issues and I think of the
older veterans that may just be starting to use the computer. (reading
page), the HLR review means that they send a request for medical
record. It doesn’t have anything to do with you but you will get the
same letter. You can bug your doctors and keep bugging them. The
dependency claim tells you that it was approved. You can go to the
recent updates; you can see if that actually w3ent through and you can
see if you are actually getting paid for 3 more kids. You can se ethe
claims and appeals in progress and the steps where they are at if you
click on them.

Would it be okay if it were on a different page: Yes that would work for
me.

What doesn’t work well for you: I like the way it is. The go to recent
claims updates, I think that should be in a box for claims in progress or
the grey box like the claim has been accepted. It is just hanging there
like I’m a red headed stepchild. The same for file a claim for
compensation. I understand why they are like that because it is part of
the claim’s overview/updates but not those things. I think they should
have grey boxes or white rectangle to differentiate the two things.

What is missing: You already have the rating they are at. I know when I
bring mine up it tells me what progress they are in on the first page,
maybe instead of it saying 4 claims in progress, have it say which
claim such as TBI, Tinnitus, or whatever or by date.

Anything you would add:  If you have any C&P exams, I know it would
be under healthcare to but technically it is a claims thing so it would be
a good reminder

Most important to see or what to see: that they are in progress and
what step they are in. It could be a click away but if I have 4 claims in
progress I would need to click it then click the claim then click other
one.

If that’s the case would it work or not: It depends on how I am that day.

Thoughts: No. I like it.

Health care/updates

What would you expect here: It could be anything from a prescription
refilled or the appointment was cancelled by the doctor. I wouldn’t
separate that into pharmacy or anything, I would keep it like this. Keep
it this way.

What are you looking at: I like the appointment cancellation is first
because it is good to know when they are cancelled because the
mailed companies tend to get to you after the fact. I like the setup and
it is all separate. I would have the appointments, messages,
prescriptions and the have the grey boxes under that then maybe the
upcoming appointments. You see the grey boxes then these upcoming
appointments, message, and prescriptions. It is a little redundant
seeing it this way. This is kind of like a red flag without a flag, they are
the important things.

What would you expect here for appointments: obviously, one is
cancelled, if you click on upcoming appointments it would say day,
time, and place. I don’t like how it just says va appointment cancelled,
it should say who it was with and where it was. I like that it has mange
appointments so maybe you can reschedule it there at least that is
what I hope.

Most important to see for appointments: Maybe that they are in order
and if possible if you click the appointment thing have them added to
your google calendar or whatever calendar you have. I don’t know if
you can do that with I phone.

What would you expect to see about prescriptions: The date they were
filled so you have a round about date when they may arrive. With how
the mail is now. It would be great to be able to set up a reminder to fill
your prescriptions because I keep forgetting to do that especially on
my 30 fills.

What would you expect to see on secure messages: who it is from, who
sent it. Sometimes they don’t put a subject there for personal reasons.
I know all secure messages go to your medical record but that’s all
good. I like how tit tells you that you have new messages. It would be
great if you could see, even if the doctor didn’t reply that they actually
got the message

If those details were on a separate page: that would work for me

Anything confusing: No I like it and I like the additional links to.

Any other links you’d want: you have lab results separate form medical
records but you can get them under medical records to. I like that. 
Maybe things that you are do for annually or something like a flu shot
reminder or if you have a breast exam coming up or preventative
medicine thing would be great on there.

Link under updates for healthcare updates, where do you think that
would take you: Maybe to lab results or any new things like if you were
diagnosed with anything new, new medications added or anything like
that.

Benefit applications

It says dependency claim, application for vet tec. Dependency claim, I
don’t know if that is the same one as the one in claims and appeals.
That just means that their dependent is turning 18 or 26 whatever
their age is for va dependency. It expires in January and it was last
open on October 12. The dates don’t make sense.  I think the vet tech
maybe for them to get help with school.

Confusing: No they are different benefits that you can apply for and I
like the other benefits that the VA offers.

The ones looking at here, how would you describe them in relation to
you: for dependency, I have 1 dependent and he turns 18 in 2023. So if
I were to click on that I would think it expires on 2023 and if I clicked
on it today in 2020 that it would be the last day I opened it or if
someone from the va checked it.

Where would go to form take you: to the actually form that was filled
out by me or the VA representative

Thoughts: Not really. The only thing, I will say when my last disability
percentage was changed. I didn’t know that I was qualified for life
insurance again. I wish someone would have explained that to me or
that it tells you on here that I was qualified. I dint  know I should have
applied for life insurance; I think something like that should be on here.
If you qualify for something it would be great that if they told her.

Where would you want to see that: under benefits applications, what
you qualify for or would you like to apply for or ask me if you qualify
for. A lot of veterans don’t realize that they qualify for certain things so
they go without.

Second task: Claims scenario

Okay great. Go ahead and go back to the previous screen by clicking 'Claims
and appeals' again. I'm now going to give you a scenario - imagine you are
trying to view all of your claims in progress and you've just landed on this
page.

1.
Could you walk me through how you would do that? All of the claims in
progress, I would go to claims/appeals to the drop down because of the
two new updates to see if there is anything in progress. It says you
have 3 file requests and then the claim has been accepted. It tells you
there are 4 in progress and 2 appeals. It is awesome they have it like
that because the way it is set up, there isn’t like click through 25
things to see where it is and whatnot. It is telling you it is in progress
and automatically tells you there are updates so you know to look at
the updates.

2.
Where for all in progress: click on claims and appeals, I figure they will
all be there even if there weren’t updates.

3.
Easy or hard: Easy because it says claims right there.
If they look for their claims in progress in the claim’s updates section:

i.
Why would you expect it to be in this section? (reading page), It
says a claim was accepted for the 526 dependency so I think that
is for adding or dropping a dependent, the recent claims updates
and 4 claims in progress then 2 appeals in progress, if you want
you can file more claims so here you can see the depo3enecy
claim ahs been accepted and that you still have 4 claims in
progress and 2 appeals. You are waiting on file for the VA to work
on the claims or appeals.

ii.
What information would you expect to see related to your claim?

Third task: Health care scenario
Okay, we're now going to move on to another scenario. Imagine you are
currently enrolled in health care with the VA. You've come to this page to see
the latest message from your doctor. Can you walk me through how you
would do that?

1.
Can you walk me through how you would do that? I would click on
healthcare, what a surprise an appointment was cancelled. That was a
really important appointment to. The prescription was filled on oct 1 I
might get it on November 1 if it is through UPS. One of my new doctors
messaged me on something I emailed them about. I have 4
appointments coming up even though 1 was cancelled and 2 messages
here and the one prescription was filled which is up there.

2.
Where would you click for the latest message: I would click on view
message From Dr.Dindot then further down it tells me I have 2 more
messages, that is a little confusing. Maybe that is one she sent me and
maybe the others are older conversation.

3.
How to make it less confusion: Either do it how Gmail has it just have
date and bold and the same for the other. I would just have under
messages bold with all of the messages with new and then you can
even make it an option to have their new messages in bold and their
older ones in regular font. Or if the doctor has an important one flag it
with a red flag and label it you have an important message from your
doctor.

If they look for messages in the health care updates section:

i.
Was it easy or hard to find your new messages? Easy because
you have two spots for it.

ii.
Can you tell me why you think it would be in the updates
section?

Comparison

Thanks so much! If you could go ahead and stop sharing your screen. Let's
take a look at versions A and B side-by-side.

Moderator shares screen and pulls upside by side screens

1.
Overall, which prototype do you prefer? Why? I like version b where
you have to click the drop down because version a you have to scroll
down. With older people like my dad went on this they would only think
that there is the grey, if he sees the arrow he would click on it but he
won’t always scroll especially because he calls things the google. It
looks nicer.

2.
Do you prefer to see updates at the top of the screen or collapsed in
each section? I like how it tells you the 4 new updates but then I like
how it says it right under it like on version B.

3.
How did these pages meet your expectations? They both meet my
expectations but I like version B better.

4.
How did these pages not meet your expectations? I would say version
A would be put together sloppy; you just have to scroll to much. The
click down is better.

5.
Do you think you would or would not use this page when you log in to
VA.gov? I would use version B more then version a. Version a I would
forget my updates by the time I got to the sections and have to go
back up whereas version b it tells me the updates under the sections.
Benefits doesn’t say I have any but I would still click on it. I would know
that I have things that need to be touched on in healthcare and claims
whereas I would have to scroll and try to remember. Having a TBI I
forget a lot and then I might not go to the bottom of the page because
I would click everywhere else. 

6.
What would you call this page? I forget the name of it but it is the
information we had a special file when we were in the military and if
we lost it we were screwed. It would be our information page but
nothing to long. Vital infomration would be to long but something along
those lines.

7.

Any other thoughts?

Wrap-up and close

Okay, thank you so much! Those are all of the questions that I had for you
today, do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us
today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site
and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
