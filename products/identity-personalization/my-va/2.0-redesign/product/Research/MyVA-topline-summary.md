This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.

**The goal of this document is:**
 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data

## Research Questions & Answers

**Do Veterans prefer design version A or B?**
 - All participants (except for one) preferred the version that they saw first
 
**Is there any confusion caused by the status update styles in A vs B design?**
 - Most participants easily understood the style of the updates
 - There was confusion around how the updates were ordered
 - Some participants were confused by the hierarchy of the updates
 - Multiple people felt that the updates were redundant to the content information
 - One participant who has cognitive issues was worried she would forget her updates in version A when she scrolled past them
 - Participants were looking for clearer calls to action on the updates
 - There was confusion around the 'Go to recent updates' link - many participants assumed this would take them to a full overview page, not the specific claim or message etc
 - There was consistent confusion around the appointments update verbiage and information included (multiple participants mentioned they would need to know where the appoint was and what it was for)
 - One veteran was confused by the updates all together and didn't know what they were referring to - he preferred them to not be on the page at all
 - Almost all participants mentioned that they would like to be able to prioritize their updates and information
 - Participants wanted a more specific call to action that links to additional updates (i.e. 'view 5 more' button)
 - Many participants felt that their updates should also show within a specific section (i.e. claims update in the updates section as well as an indicator within the claims section)
 
**Can people find what they're looking for on the dashboard?**
 - All users were easily able to find what they were looking for regardless of the prototype they were using
 
**Does the placement of the disability rating make sense to users?**
 - Yes - there was no confusion around this
 - Participants also understood what would happen if they clicked on the disability rating link

**In the claims and health care sections, do users understand what is being displayed? Is it enough information?**
 - Overall, users understood the healthcare section
 - Multiple users mentioned that they would like to see what type of healthcare they are enrolled in (vision, hearing, etc.)
 - There was confusion about the wording in the messages update vs what was showing below
 - There was some confusion about 'upcoming appointment' and 'cancelled appointment' in the updates section - users did not know if the cancelled appointment was their upcoming appointment
 - Multiple participants brought up the question about what would happen if they had dependents and if it would show on this page
 - A couple users were confused by the verbiage 'prescription refills' - they didn't know if it was currently filled or if they needed to take action 
 
 **What information is important for them to see first?**
 - All participants mentioned that they would want to see anything that was time-sensitive and needed their attention first
 - Participants were okay with seeing any additional details on a separate page
 
**What information related to health care, claims and applications/benefits do users want to see?**
 - Participants wanted to easily navigate to all the details of health care, claims and beneftis - but it did not all have to be on one page
 - Many participants mentioned wanting to see any information that would potentially need them to take action

**Is any information missing on the dashboard?**
 - Some specifics about appointments specfically location details and type of appointment (dermatology etc.) 
 - Many participants mentioned they want to be able to track their prescription packages
 - Potentially some information related to dependents
 - One user mentioned she would like to see a place to schedule a C&P exam
 - Two participants wanted to see the facility the doctor that was sending the message was from

**Do users expect to see more information on a desktop view?**
 - We didn't answer this question in this study

**How do people think the new dashboard compares to the current MyVA?**
 - Participants overall had a very positive response to the page
 - Most participants didn't have very specific memories of MyVA, so it is difficult to directly compare

**What updates are most important to users?**
 - Anything that is time-sensitive and need their attention

**Do people want to see all of their most recent updates?**
 - Not necessarily.  People were more interested in knowing if there was anything urgent or if there was anything coming up (aka appointments).  Status changes were also brought up as something that users wanted to see - but it was not immediately what they were looking for. 
 
### A Design specific questions

**Does the dashboard layout/structure feel intuitive?**
- All users were easily able to complete all tasks regardless of what prototype they were using

**Do people understand what the updates to their dashboard are?**
- The majority of participants understood what their updates were. There was confusion about the hierarchy of how the updates are listed and a couple users mentioned it seemed redundant to the content of the page.

**Do users want to see updates grouped all together?**
- There was no clear answer to this. Participants preferred the grouping of updates based that they interacted with first. A couple participants mentioned they would like to see updates broken into specific sections - more than what was displayed in version B. For example, instead of having all health care updates in the health care section, they wanted to see prescription updates in the prescription section etc.

### B Design specific questions

**Does the dashboard layout/structure feel intuitive?**
- All users were easily able to complete all tasks regardless of what prototype they were using

**Do people understand what the updates to their dashboard are?**

- The majority of participants understood what their updates were. There was confusion about the hierarchy of how the updates are listed and a couple users mentioned it seemed redundant to the content of the page.

**Do users want to see updates in each specific section?**

- There was no clear answer to this. Participants preferred the grouping of updates based that they interacted with first. A couple participants mentioned they would like to see updates broken into specific sections - more than what was displayed in version B. For example, instead of having all health care updates in the health care section, they wanted to see prescription updates in the prescription section etc.

**Can people easily find what they are looking for with information collapsed in accordions?**

- Yes. Participants preferred the information structure based on what they interacted with first - but they were all still able to find informatio in both prototypes.

## Hypotheses & Answers

**Version A will be more slightly more successful than version B. Version A has all of the status updates elevate to the top of the page, and we hypothesize it will have less of a cognitive load. Version A has a long scrolling page design so all information is readily accessed, instead of being buried. However, both designs will be of value to the veterans as far as having accesss to thier updates and other important health care and claims information.**

 - False.  Users preferred whatever prototype they saw first. As far as completing tasks efficiently - there was no clear 'winner' here. Users were easily able to complete tasks/find information in both versions. However, there was a lot of talk about the updates and content being redundant and there was some confusion around how the updates were prioritized. Overall, the response to the page was positive. All users said they would use the page if it were on the site. 
 
 **Overall users will be able to see and understand the update section**
 
 - True.  All users understood the updates section. Except for the link to 'Go to recent updates' - most users were confused by this.
 
 **People will want to see more detailed personalized information than what is shown (i.e. upcoming appointments)**
 
 - False. People were fine with seeing less information as long as they could access all of the details on a different page.
 
**The new myVA dashboard layout will overall be intuitive and scan-able**

 - True.  All users were easily able to find and navigate both prototypes.
 
## Other Findings

**All users were confused by the Benefit applications section**
- All users did not know if the benefits shown were suggestions from the VA, forms they had already started or forms they needed to fill out
- Multiple users thought that the benefits section should live as part of the claims section or directly below it 
- A few people mentioned they would like to see the progress of the form (i.e. a pie or progress bar)

**Users were confused by the 'Go to recent updates' links**
- Many users thought that the 'Go to recent updates' link would take them to a full section overview page

**Showing a chronological order of updates may not be the best solution.**
- The majority of participants found the updates to be helpful - but many mentioned they were confused by the prioritization of the updates
- Many participants mentioned they would want to see any time-sensitive or action-based updates first
