View the [Research Plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/product/Research/MyVA%20Research%20Plan.md).

## Research Goals 

This research was to compare two mobile versions of the My VA dashboard re-design and gain feedback on the preferred wireframe direction.  Each version (A and B) contains the same information, just structured differently. We were trying to understand which direction makes the most sense to users. This includes:

- overall, is there enough relevant information on the dashboard to be valuable
- can the user quickly find the information that they are looking for 
- does the page structure (scrolling vs navigation) affect ease of visibility
- can the user easily access and understand any personal updates (claims, health care, or forms)
- how easily can the user navigate to the sections they are looking for
- is the new dashboard layout more effective than the current MyVA page

*Note - This was a preference test, **not** an A/B test

## Research Methodology 

We conducted remote moderated usability testing via Zoom using the Perigean contract. This method allowed us to share a high-fidelity wireframe prototype (mobile A & B versions). All users joined using their mobile devices (android, iphone and samsung).

### Who we talked to

- 8 Veterans
- Ages varied from 35-65 (exact demographics unknown)
- 7 out of 8 veterans were currently disabled (ranging from 10%-100%)
- 6 out of 8 veterans were currently enrolled and using health care through the VA
- All 8 veterans were currently receiving some type of benefit (retirement, health care, GI bill etc)
- 1 out of 8 veterans had cognitive considerations
- 8 out of 8 veterans managed their benefits online (using primarily MHV and ebenefits)

### Research Questions

- Do Veterans prefer design version A or B?
- Is there any confusion caused by the status update styles in A vs B design?
- Can people find what they're looking for on the dashboard?
- Does the placement of the disability rating make sense to users?
- In the claims and health care sections, do users understand what is being displayed? Is it enough information?
- What information is important for them to see first?
- What information related to health care, claims and applications/benefits do users want to see?
- Is any information missing on the dashboard?
- Do users expect to see more information on a desktop view? (*note: we did not test this in this study*)
- How do people think the new dashboard compares to the current MyVA?
- What updates are most important to users?
- Do people want to see all of their most recent updates?

### A Design specific questions

- Does the dashboard layout/structure feel intuitive?
- Do people understand what the updates to their dashboard are?
- Do users want to see updates grouped all together?

### B Design specific questions
- Does the dashboard layout/structure feel intuitive?
- Do people understand what the updates to their dashboard are?
- Do users want to see updates in each specific section?
- Can people easily find what they are looking for with information collapsed in accordions?

## Key Findings

*Note: Both prototypes can be referenced at the bottom of this document (A and B)*

### Overall

1. Users preferred the prototype they saw first. As far as completing tasks efficiently - there was no clear 'winner'. Users were easily able to complete tasks/find information in both versions. 
2. Users do not expect to see *all* their information on an overview page - they want to see any time-sensitive information or action items and all other details can live on a separate page.
3. Users found the information provided in the updates and other sections of the prototypes to be redundant.
4. Users did not understand the hierarchy of the information shown in the updates.
5. Overall, users said they would use the overview page and would find it useful.

### Claims & appeals

1. Users easily understood the placement and link of the disability rating.
2. Users are looking to see any status changes to their claims. 

### Health care

1. Users would like to see what type of healthcare they are enrolled in (vision, dental, etc.).
2. Participants wanted to see the facility that new messages were from, as well as the doctor's name. 
3. Users wanted to see additional details concerning their appointments - specifically location details (i.e. address, telehealth etc) and type of appointment/doctor (i.e. dermatology, primary care etc).
5. Users were confused by the verbiage used in the prescriptions section.

### Benefit applications

1. Users did not know if the benefits shown in the 'Benefit applications' section were suggestions from the VA, forms they had already started, or forms they needed to fill out.

## Details of Findings

### Overall

**1. Users preferred whatever prototype they saw first. As far as completing tasks efficiently - there was no clear 'winner'. Users were easily able to complete tasks/find information in both versions.** 7 out of 8 users preferred the prototype that they interacted with first. All users expressed that it was easy to complete tasks.   

> "It all makes sense to me, it makes more sense than what we got right now, this is going to be easier to find out things. It all seems to be right here."

> "I mean to be honest this covers the main things. Appointments, messages, prescription refills, accessing the medical history is very useful because you have to click a lot of times and having it there is important. I can tell you there’s nothing more stressful then click on different tabs to find the medical history but having it there easy to access is useful.

> "They both met my expectations by providing a lot of information and being readable. I don’t have a problem with either one."

**2. Users do not expect to see *all* their information on an overview page - they want to see any time-sensitive information or action items and all other details can live on a separate page.**. All users understood that this was just an overview page and said it would be okay if more information lived on a separate page.  All participants easily understood that the information shown was not all their information, and in order to see specific details they'd have to leave the page.

> "As it relates to the updates, I would hope to see information that is time sensitive be first. There are explanation marks that are important but that is more of 'hey, look at this, it is important', but it's not in an order that I feel would be conducive if you have multiple notification if they have been checked. Having the ones with explanation marks or prioritized in a way that is the most important to the person or the doctor first."

> "I like it a lot. It is straight and to the point, not to much writing or reading. It provides the ability to access important information, but not straight when I access the page so I can go somewhere private to access may medical information."

**3. Users found the information provided in the updates and other sections of the prototypes to be redundant.** There was some confusion about the information architecture - users didn't know what information was the most important on the page and were confused by updates being pulled out of subcategories.

> "I like that you have the updates in a different color but I think they should be under the subcategory."

> "I would have the appointments, messages, prescriptions and the have the grey boxes under that then maybe the upcoming appointments. You see the grey boxes then these upcoming appointments, message, and prescriptions. It is a little redundant seeing it this way. This is kind of like a red flag without a flag, they are the important things."

> " It seems redundant because there is one claim and then you can go to recent claims... why would we need to go to recent claim if we can go to overview and see the same information? We don’t need all the other stuff if we can go to an overview.

> "The grey boxes (updates) are redundant to the blocks about the appointments, messages and prescriptions. I don’t know if the grey boxes (updates) will do anything differently than going straight to the blocks."

**4. Users did not understand the hierarchy of the information shown in the updates.** Users did not understand how the updates were being displayed (chronological, level of urgency, etc). Participants mentioned that the most important updates to see are messages from their doctor, any changes in appointments or upcoming appointments.  Claim status changes are important to see, but are often not time-sensitive so they preferred to not have those updates at the top of the page.

> "The 4 new updates... if you look at the dates, how are they ordered? Are they by section? Or are they by date? I am not really sure."

> "I am not sure if they are in order due to importance or not, but just looking at it at face value it is information that is important... but it's kind of confusing."

> "I want to see the messages from the provider and the upcoming appointments. The claim updates aren’t as important because they are not as time sensitive as upcoming appointments and messages."

**5. Overall, users said they would use the overview page and would find it useful.** Participants had very positive feedback on both prototypes, specifically mentioning that they didn't have to login to multiple places to see an overview of their information. 

> "For sure it would work for me because this is a one stop shop to notify me what is available at the time and if I wanted to inquire more I can click on them to access it on another page. Because it is a cellphone and not a tablet a lot of the information must be smaller so to have it quick and to the point is something I prefer." 

> "...having easy access to the information on my own time without jumping through hoops is important to me."

> "It is better than I thought it would be. It seems like it will be a lot easier once it is up and running. It is a lot better than I thought it would be. I thought it would be a page that you have to enter 15 times then see things but if we can put it in once and see everything that is fantastic."

### Claims & appeals

**1. Users easily understood the placement and link of the disability rating.** Participants understood that the link would lead to a more detailed breakdown of their disability rating. All users were fine to see these details on a separate page.

> "I really like that, that is a good thing you don’t have to go search for it."

> "I see my name, and current rating which is cool because I keep forgetting to look at mine."

**2. Users are looking to see any status changes to their claims.** Participants are looking to see more information than what is shown on the overview currently, specifically title and date of the claim - all other details can live on a separate page.  However, users mentioned that a smaller amount of information would still work for them as long as they could easily access their details.

> "...maybe instead of it saying 4 claims in progress, have it say which claim such as TBI, Tinnitus, or whatever or by date."

> "I want to see that they are in progress and what step they are in. It could be a click away but if I have 4 claims in progress I would need to click it then click the claim then click another one."

> "My biggest concern is... did they receive it? Is it processed? Do I need to do anything? and when is it projected to be completed? I think I can see that from here."


### Health care

**1. Users would like to see what type of healthcare they are enrolled in (vision, dental, etc).** Participants also wanted clarity about the *type* of healthcare being shown (i.e. VA healthcare vs another provider). 

> "Maybe list the type of healthcare that are able to have such as vision and dental since they are not a given."

> "'Enrolled since' is okay, but if I could see what kind of insurance I am in enrolled in, that would be great."

**2. Participants wanted to see the facility that new messages were from, as well as the doctor's name.** There was frustration around not recognizing or knowing who was sending the message without an additional identifier. Otherwise, users were fine with the information shown. (Sent from, date, subject) Participants also mentioned wanting the ability for the doctor to flag a message if it's urgent or important.

> "Often times you will get a message from the PCM nurse that you never met so that’s why it is even more important to have the clinic name. I received many messages and they didn’t know who it was. My PCM quit in August so I was changed clinics and I emailed the green team questions and they told me I have a new provider then I received a new email because my PCM cancelled all medications until she met me which was a disaster so I couldn’t get my meds and I started getting messages from her nurse. They had to use the VA directory to figure out who messaged me. It is really important to know the doctors department because you may not know the doctors name.

> "...if the doctor has an important one flag it with a red flag and label it you have an important message from your doctor."

**3. Users wanted to see additional details concerning their appointments - specifically location details (i.e. address, telehealth etc) and type of medical practice (i.e. dermatology, primary care etc).**. Many users mentioned that appointments are a point of frustration in general. There is not currently enough information being shown to be confident they are going to the right place - many users said they always call ahead of time or show up early to double check.  Otherwise, users were fine with the information shown. (appointment type, date, time, phone number)  

> "I don’t like how it just says va appointment cancelled, it should say who it was with and where it was."

> "...but I am not sure where the appointment is. It would be clearer if it says if it is phone, telehealth or at the va facility. It says when. It doesn’t answer who its with, what appointment, where the appointment is. I like it says Saturday September 14th because I want the date then the additional information because of planning. That has been a challenge lately I have had to call to confirm if it is a link, or a phone call form the va."

> "I like that but give timeframes. If it is a week I am not tracking 4 in the next week but in the next month."

> "A lot of times I don’t get the appointment or I forget to write it down so I have to call to see what it is for it would be nice to have the date, location, who its with and what its for. Something like that would be super super nice."

**5. Users were confused by the verbiage used in the prescriptions section.** Multiple participants were confused by 'prescription refills' - they didn't know if it was currently filled or if they needed to do anything so their prescription would be refilled. There was also confusion about where the prescription would be going if it was filled. However, all participants were okay if these details lived on a separate page.

> "The date they were filled so you have a round about date when they may arrive. With how the mail is now. It would be great to be able to set up a reminder to fill your prescriptions because I keep forgetting to do that especially on my 30 fills."

> "In my case I would assume it would be here in 7 days but if I see this and I am at the VA I would assume it was the pharmacy If I weren’t here what would you do: it depends where I am. If I am at the VA I would go ask if they had the prescription."

> "I am not really sure if it means one prescription was refilled or one could be refilled. So when you request the refill you have to do it 2 weeks in advance or is there one I need to pick up or one coming in the mail so I should be looking for it. The plural of refill is different than one prescription refill. It is available for request of refill now. I am not sure if you are telling me if it is coming in the mail, it needs picked up or eligible for refill. Maybe refilled would make me look for it or refilled at pharmacy, or 1 prescription refill available."

### Benefit applications

**1. Users did not know if the benefits shown in the 'Benefit applications' section were suggestions from the VA, forms they had already started, or forms they needed to fill out.** Users also mentioned that they would be very interested in seeing things that they qualify for, especially if there is a change in their rating.

> "I think they are different benefits that you can apply for and I'd like to see the other benefits that the VA offers."

> "I think it will take me to the form and not the claim info... actually is this an in-process claim or submitted? I don't know..."

> "The only thing, I will say when my last disability percentage was changed. I didn’t know that I was qualified for life insurance again. I wish someone would have explained that to me or that it tells you on here that I was qualified. I didn't know I should have applied for life insurance; I think something like that should be on here. If you qualify for something it would be great that if they told me."

## Additional Insights

1. Users had a wide range of titles for this page including: Vital information, MyVA, My dashboard, My landing page
2. Users mentioned things that we may be able to implement in the future including:
    - scheduling C&P exams
    - tracking prescription packages
    - any annual health reminders (i.e. flu shots, physicals)
    - prescription reminders
    - adding appointments to a mobile calendar
    - dependent information
    - payment totals
    - current/pending referrals
    - customizing their personal page

3. There was confusion around the 'Go to recent updates' link - many participants assumed this would take them to a full overview page, not the specific claim or message etc.
4. Users thought that the benefit applications section and claims and appeals section should live together or closer together.
5. Users mentioned that they would like to see a 'wellness' tab - with diet and exercise recommendations.

## Recommendations

1. Pursue a direction that shows users set information about their benefits/health care each time they come to the site to reduce the redundancy of information shown.
2. Compile all 'updates' into each specific subcategory instead of having a dedicated 'updates' section.
3. Add some more information in each section where possible. The minimum is outlined below.
    - Claims needs title, date and status
    - Messages needs sent from (name), sent from (clinic), date, subject
    - Appointments needs appointment type, medical practice type, location, location details  date, time, contact information
4. Work with copy to update verbiage around prescriptions and 'Go to all' links.

## Next Steps

1. Update all mobile wireframes
2. Create desktop versions
3. Update UI design on all versions
4. Test again
