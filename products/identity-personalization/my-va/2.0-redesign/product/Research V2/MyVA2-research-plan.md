# Research Plan for VSA Authenticated Experience: MyVA Redesign February 2021

## Goals

The goal of this research is to understand user comprehension after a full structure and design update of the MyVA page. This includes:
 
- overall, is there enough relevant information on the dashboard to be valuable
- can the user find the information that they are looking for effectively 
- can the user easily access and understand any personal updates (claims, health care, or forms)
- how easily can the user navigate to the sections they are looking for
- is the new dashboard layout more effective than the current MyVA page

## Background
Our goal is to create a My VA dashboard design that will improve the online experience for Veterans, by better integrating Veteran-provided data onto the My VA dashboard. Our MVP will focus on surfacing their health care and claims information into widgets and notifications to help Veterans access their critical information and to take action on status updates.

## Research questions

### Overall questions
- Do Veterans prefer design version A or B?
- Is there any confusion caused by the status update styles in A vs B design?
- Can people find what they're looking for on the dashboard?
- Does the placement of the disability rating make sense to users?
- In the claims and health care sections, do users understand what is being displayed? Is it enough information?
- What information is important for them to see first?
- What information related to health care, claims and applications/benefits do users want to see?
- Is any information missing on the dashboard?
- Do users expect to see more information on a desktop view?
- How do people think the new dashboard compares to the current MyVA?
- What updates are most important to users?
- Do people want to see all of their most recent updates?

### A Design specific questions

- Does the dashboard layout/structure feel intuitive?
- Do people understand what the updates to their dashboard are?
- Do users want to see updates grouped all together?

### B Design specific questions
- Does the dashboard layout/structure feel intuitive?
- Do people understand what the updates to their dashboard are?
- Do users want to see updates in each specific section?
- Can people easily find what they are looking for with information collapsed in accordions?


## Hypothesis & assumptions
* Version A will be more slightly more successful than version B.
Version A has all of the status updates elevate to the top of the page, and we hypothesize it will have less of a cognitive load. Version A has a long scrolling page design so all information is readily accessed, instead of being buried. However, both designs will be of value to the veterans as far as having accesss to thier updates and other important health care and claims information.

Other assumptions include:

- Overall users will be able to see and understand the update section
- People will want to see more detailed personalized information than what is shown (i.e. upcoming appointments)
- The new myVA dashboard layout will overall be intuitive and scan-able

## Method
We will conduct remote moderated usability testing via Zoom using the Perigean contract. This method will allow us to share a high-fidelity wireframe prototype (mobile A & B versions).

## Participants and Recruitment

Recruit for 12 sessions (8 fulfilled sessions showing each user versions A & B) using the following criteria:

### Must have for participants

* Are you eligible for/recieve VA health care, have active or past claims or recieve any benefits from the VA? (pass = yes)
    * If participants with health care, claims or benefits are too difficult to recruit for, then expand to having logged-in to va.gov within the last year.

### Good to have for participants
* At least one iOS mobile device owner
* At least one Android mobile device owner
* At least 2 women
* At least 1 person of color
* At least 2 participants 35 or under and 1 participant over 55
* At least 1 participant who currently receives VA health care
* At least one person with a disability rating of 70% or greater
* At least one person with an identified cognitive consideration of PTSD or TBI
 

### Recruitment requirements
* All participants must use a mobile device.
* The participants have Zoom downloaded **on their phone** prior to the session
* The participants know how to screen-share.

We will not be able to accommodate non-sighted users due to the prototype technology.

## Timeline 	
#### Desired Timeline: November 20-30, 2020 

Please schedule sessions for 75 minutes with a 30 minute buffer between sessions.
