# Research Plan for VSA Authenticated Experience: MyVA Redesign February 2021

## Goals

The goal of this research is to understand user comprehension of the MyVA page after a full re-structure and re-design. This includes:
 
- Overall, is there enough relevant information on the dashboard to be valuable?
- Can the user find the tools and tasks that they are looking for effectively? 
- Can the user easily access and understand any personal updates (related to claims, health care, or forms)?
- Is the new dashboard layout more effective than the current MyVA page?

## Background

Based on past user interviews, we know people come to VA.gov to see information that is relevant to them and to complete tasks specific to their benefits. Users do not want to see links, suggestions or information that doesn't apply to them personally on their dashboard.

Our goal is to create a My VA dashboard design that will improve the online experience for Veterans, by better integrating Veteran-provided data onto the My VA dashboard. The MyVA dashboard aims to surface the status and the most recent update to a users health care information, claims information, and any applications in progress. Users should also be able to quickly and easily reach the tools that allow them to manage this information.

## Research questions

**Overall questions**
- Did we correctly prioritize this page?
- Is this page useful? Does it have the information and actions it needs?
- Is there anything they expected to see on My VA that’s missing?
- What do people think My VA is?
- What do people think will happen if they click My VA? Does our flow meet expectations?

**My VA vs. the homepage**
- What would people use My VA for vs. what would people use the homepage for?
- If there was no homepage, what would a user need My VA to do that it’s not currently doing?

**Mobile questions**

*Note-these probably aren’t questions we’d ask outright, but more assess by behavior*

- Can people find what they need on mobile?
- Does the page feel too long/like there is too much scrolling required to get to the information they need?

**Nametag**
- What identifiers do people expect to see on this page?
- Can people find their disability rating? Did they notice it in the name tag?

**Profile**
- Where do users think the profile link goes?
- What do they think is the difference is between the profile vs. My VA?

**Claims**
- Do they understand the featured claim is the most recently-updated claim?
- Do they know how many claims and appeals they have total? Is this information helpful to them?
- Do they know how to view the featured claim/all claims?
- Is there information missing — or are there actions missing — from this section?
- What do people expect to happen if they have no claims in progress?

**Health care**
- Did we correctly prioritize information in this section by featuring latest/most recent information? Or, are the CTAs into the tools and update totals more important?
- Can they find “totals” information (i.e. 2 unread messages)? And does this information matter to them?
- Do people understand the latest message (or upcoming appointment or most recent refill) is part of “2 unread messages” (or whatever total) or do they think it’s the latest message + 2 more unread messages (or whatever total)?
- Do people understand they are looking at their most recent prescription refill update? Why do they think they are seeing this prescription vs. another prescription?
- Do people understand how they can get more information about their messages/appointments/prescriptions?
- Do people understand the CTAs will not take them directly to the latest or most recent information? Do they understand CTAs will take them to an overview page?
- Are there other links, CTAs, or information that would be helpful to show in this section?

**Apply for benefits**
- Do people understand that they are looking at applications that they’ve started but not yet submitted? Do they understand what “in progress” means?
- Do people understand how to view an in-progress application?
- Do people understand why we are showing certain benefits in “benefits you might be interested in”?
- Do people think “benefits you might be interested in” are the ONLY benefits they are eligible for?
- Do people understand how to get more information on what benefits the VA offers? Is the information provided helpful to them?

## Hypothesis & assumptions

- The new myVA dashboard layout will overall be intuitive and scan-able
- Users will understand how to navigate to tools to manage their information
- Users may want to see some additional information on the dashboard that we did not include
- Participants might be confused about some of the verbiage used (most likely in the prescriptions section)
- Participants might be confused that the links to view all (i.e. You have 2 unread messages) will take them to a separate page/site

## Method
We will conduct remote moderated usability testing via Zoom using the Perigean contract. This method will allow us to share a high-fidelity wireframe prototype.

## Participants and Recruitment

Recruit for 12 sessions (8 fulfilled sessions) using the following criteria:

### Must have for participants

* Are you eligible for/recieve VA health care, have active or past claims or recieve any benefits from the VA? (pass = yes)
    * If participants with health care, claims or benefits are too difficult to recruit for, then expand to having logged-in to va.gov within the last year.

### Good to have for participants
* At least one iOS mobile device owner
* At least one Android mobile device owner
* At least 2 women
* At least 1 person of color
* At least 2 participants 35 or under and 1 participant over 55
* At least 1 participant who currently receives VA health care
* At least one person with a disability rating of 70% or greater
* At least one person with an identified cognitive consideration of PTSD or TBI
 

### Recruitment requirements
* All participants must use a mobile device.
* The participants have Zoom downloaded **on their phone** prior to the session
* The participants know how to screen-share.

We will not be able to accommodate non-sighted users due to the prototype technology.
