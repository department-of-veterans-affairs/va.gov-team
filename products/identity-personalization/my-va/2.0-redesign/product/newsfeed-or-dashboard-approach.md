# Notes from DEPO chats about My VA: Do we take a newsfeed or dashboard approach?

### [Notes on final decision and direction](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/product/my-va-jobs.md)

## 12.2.20 3:00 ET chat with Meg, Danielle, Ryan, and Steve

- Meg - Tell veteran what they need to know now or what they need to know soon.
- Steve giving some history — dashboard was supposed to be the “action” center. Profile is everything the VA knows about you. Steve thinks that this is way too broadly scoped.
- Don’t just contextualize how this shows up in VA.gov, but how it fills into competitive landscape — what is your expectation when you log in to your bank or health care website?
- Meg is thinking about hierarchy — a “pure” newsfeed wouldn’t be hierarchical. We have a limited set of things now, but is there a way to figure out how to show blank state?
- Ryan - “I love the task oriented approach organized by priority”. If you’re a new veteran, you don’t have a lot, but here are somethings you *could* do. If you’ve been here for 5 years, and there’s nothing for you to do, that’s OK. To him, the hierarchy is the same across scenarios, but based on what you have, we know what to surface first. Eg. Calorie counting app — you alway start with nothing. Then you go into the meet of it. Apple health - very different for everyone; some people are active and some are not, but there are some baseline things. Where it gets dicey — what happens when you have multiple things within a thing (like health care and appointments)?
- Steve - There is the bank affordance of “here is your account and the transaction on your account.” Then there’s the level up “here’s your account and here is your summary.” Sometimes he thinks that the dashboard is the level up in the bank metaphor, where it’s “here is the first couple of things you need to know about your account with compensation.” “Here’s your first could of things that you need to know about your health care.” And maybe it’s nothing. Mentioned benefit eligibility — the one thing the dashboard was initial attempt to fix was actually benefit eligibility, so it kind of needs to be here’s the stuff you have and here’s the stuff you could get.

### Which approach?

- Meg: Traditional dashboard — Steve said something that really resonated with me about what’ is available to them. It’s also a more stable and steady approach. There are also possibilities for scaling it. I think a newsfeed might be too volatile and might not grab your attention.
- Danielle: Feels the same way as Meg. For edu, someone might have some of that going as transitioning. I could be totally off base on this, but it feels like if you had a bunch of notifications, it could be overwhelming from a cognitive perspective.
- Ryan: Dashboard
- Steve: Dashboard

## 12.2.20 chat with Jen Lee, Sabrina, Emily Mann, Kevin H, John H, and Matt Self

- Jen - I like the newsfeed approach because it has the capability to be really personalized. It has the ability to give someone information on something I need to take action on. The benefit of the newsfeed is that if something is time sensitive, it just shows me.
- Sabrina - From what I would imagine, veterans come to my VA in order to manage THEIR healthcare and benefits. Therefore, shouldn’t we prioritize that as the #1 goal of the UI? Some sort of navigable dashboard. Navigation seems key here, versus a potentially “overwhelming” notification experience that you described.
- Kevin - Your question - “What is the job this is supposed to do?” — the thing you’ve designed are two distinct organizing principle. Notifications = what do I need to do? As I would get to a profile, I want to know what tasks to do, and I think the newsfeed is better at that.
- Sabrina - People are coming here to manage their benefits, I think that in terms of a dashboard where I can easily get to specific categories is the core job, and post MVP…. For my bank, I use X and Y, and they have a separate Notification Center for things like “make sure your address is up to date.”
- Emily asked about MHV and if health care users think of MHV as home (yes).
- Emily - In the user testing sessions, people mentioned seeing time-sensitive info at the top, and I think the newsfeed pushes more time sensitive things to the top.
- Kevin- Whatever you do should be small and concise at first to see if it works. If you’re showing people what they can do, don’t show them all the things, show them the thing they might need to do based on their experience. 
- Matt - Is the place where you are supposed to come to move your relationship with the VA forward? The newsfeed might be better at that. But if this isn’t where we are ultimately trying to drive everyone, then I think the model doesn’t work as well.
- Kevin: You said something about “we could do this in email”… My opinion, based on a few veteran research sessions, there is never too many places you can send a veteran information. In communication, My VA is a channel like email and text. 
- Kevin: We need to determine the job of this page beyond “we show you updates of your information.” What if My VA is everything you need to do in the next 30 days?

### Which is more effective?

- Jen: Notification/newsfeed model; truly personalized and data driven
- Sabrina: Dashboard experience; more navigable for a variety of different tasks
- Emily: I’m leaning in the newsfeed/notification approach because of the timeliness user need I just mentioned.
- Kevin: I think the newsfeed is a better solution for solving the design problem of telling a veteran what they need to know. 
- John: I’m going to say dashboard, because I think the audience isn’t as sophisticated. Newsfeed approach might be too overwhelming.
- Matt: I’m leaning toward the dashboard, but I don’t have enough data either way. Is this the primary experience? Then maybe the newsfeed. But if it’s not the primary experience, I lean the other way.
