# V1 post-launch improvements

This is a running list of things we should consider for My VA 2.0 post-launch improvements:

- Better guidance to the page, including potentially adding My VA to the unauth nav.
- Elevating direct deposit - this is a top search term from My VA, and we haven't elevated this.
- Including latest payment information.
- Including links to records information
- Including links to edu benefits.
  - Based on the current GI bill implementation, I don't know that we could fully pull that into the dashboard.
