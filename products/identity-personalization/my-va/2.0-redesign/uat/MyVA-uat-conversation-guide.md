## Intro - 2 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Tressa and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about the My VA page on VA.gov. We've just built this page and we want to make sure that it is all working properly in your account and that all of your information is showing up correctly.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take less than 30 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **We will not be updating or changing any of your information today.** We are just testing the functionality of this page, and will not be making any changes.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** If you find something we show you to be confusing, we want to hear about it. Your honest insights help us to figure out how we can improve the veteran experience, and we will not be offended by any opinions you express.
- **We will be able to see your real information today.** This may include some healthcare information and some claims information. During any of the tasks if you feel uncomfortable sharing your screen with any of your information on it, feel free to stop screensharing and start again when you feel comfortable. 
- - **We will be clicking on a lot of links, if you can open them in a separate tab it will help keep things moving.** You can do this by right clicking the link and selecting 'Open in new tab'. 
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 

## Warm-up/Screener Questions - 3 minutes

OK,let's get started.

1. First, can you tell me a little bit about yourself? (If stuck, prompt to ask about service experience, where they live, their work).
2. Can you confirm for me that you have a DS Logon, MyHealtheVet, or ID.me account? 
- If they do not know what that means, ask: Do you ever sign into any va websites, such as VA.gov or ebenefits, to access or apply for your benefits? (If yes: Can you talk me through how you do that?) 
3. Do you know your username and password? 
  - If not: Are these readily accessible? Could get them?
  - If the user can not remember or retrieve their login credentials, **end the session.**
4. Can you tell me what type of computer you are using today? 
  - If needed: I'm asking this question because sometimes the type of computer can affect your experience with the tools. Knowing which one you are using will help our developers make adjustments if needed.
5. Can you tell me which web browser you are using? 
6. Do you currently have a disability rating from the VA?
7. Do you currently or have you ever recieved benefits from the VA?
  - Do you currently recieve health care benefits from the VA?
  - If no: Have you ever applied for VA health care?
  - Do you currently recieve any education benefits from the VA?
8. Do you have any active claims or appeals at the VA?
9. Today we are going to observe you interacting with the new tools on your computer. Would you feel comfortable sharing your screen with me at this time?  
  - If no: Explain this is necessary for testing. If they are still unwilling, **end the call.**

**Screenshare**

OK, please share your screen, and then we will get started.
