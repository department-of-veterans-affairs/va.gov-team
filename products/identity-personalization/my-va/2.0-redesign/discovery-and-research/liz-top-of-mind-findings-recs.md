## Overall

### Provide Veterans with a task-based, personalized experience focused on content specific to them.

The personalized pages participants created in our study reflect that what Veterans need is a landing pad that gives them access to their most important tasks in one place.  Links and content that isn't relevant to the logged-in user are seen as clutter and noise.  This is supported in the sentiments we heard in our stakeholder interviews,  and also by what we saw in our comparative analysis.  We need to create a logged-in homepage that is focused on the Veteran. It should:

- Give them access to their most important tasks in one place
- Minimize content that is not specific to them
- Allow them to complete straightforward tasks directly on the page
- Link them to more complicated tasks (that live on another page)
- Provide them with updates on their important tasks, and updates from the VA
- Help them access information and recommendations:
  - related to benefits they don't already have
  - about how dependents can use benefits
  - Veteran events (online, and at their local VA Medical Center)

### Our design needs to scale so that users with many benefits can find exactly what they've logged in to do just as easily as users who may have only one or two items on their logged-in homepage.

Previous research, stakeholder interviews, analytics, and the user research we conducted all tell us that Veterans are interested in a variety of benefit information. Our design needs to scale for the new Veteran (not receiving benefits), the established Veteran (receiving many benefits), and everyone in between. Our user research taught us that it's important that our design also scales to account for elevating benefit recommendations and highlighting other relevant information supporting Veterans such as wellness and local Veteran events.

### Make it easy for the Veteran to complete their tasks in one place

We can help Veterans feel grounded and create a more efficient, seamless experience for them if we bring in tasks from MHV, eBenefits and VA.gov to one centralized place. Don't bounce them around between eBenefits and MHV and VA.gov and all over VA.gov to find the information they're looking for.

## UI Recommendations

### The logged-in homepage should show the user information about all the benefits they're signed up for, with an emphasis on health care and disability tasks.

Our user research taught us that users want access to all their benefits in one place, and that health care and disability tools/tasks were the highest priority.  We saw these benefits as priorities in the brand consolidation research studies, and in our review of analytics. 

Emphasizing these over other tasks also makes sense because these benefits require more management and active engagement (e.g. regularly ordering medication, checking for updates on a claim) when compared to other benefits such as education.

- Disability:
  - Track claim status/see updates
  - Review disability payments
  - View disability ratings
- Healthcare 
  - Schedule appointments
  - Message their doctor
  - Refill prescriptions
  - Access medical records

A complete list of benefit-related items participants prioritized on the personalized pages they created is available in the [user research findings summary](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md#participants-are-primarily-interested-in-completing-healthcare-and-disability-related-tasks-such-as-messaging-ordering-medication-and-checking-claim-status).

### Need to address grouping and labeling information...

- Participants have clear mental models about what they can do on MHV vs eBenefits
- They clearly grouped active health care items together; static items like medical records and VAMC were exceptions that went into different, inconsistent sections 
- Claims were most commonly placed with disability benefit information but there were at least 2 participants who expected that to encompass broader claims such as education (as seen in the blue sky prototype)
- Many referred to disability as "compensation"
- Finesse through user testing 



### Provide a centralized place for VA letters and documents.

All participants in our research study had something on their homepage related to documents or records, and a few participants went a step further and created a dedicated section for all VA documents (examples below). They expected to see a button or link on their homepage that would take them to a central place for all documents. 

### Provide a mix of links and widgets to complete tasks on the logged-in homepage, and with clear labels for next steps.



### 

### Incorporate specific aspects of the blue sky prototype design such information snapshots, direct links to details, secondary navigation, and clear communication of time-sensitive information.

This went over very well with most participants and aligns with similar layouts and prioritization we saw in the comparative analysis. Following this pattern closely would save design time and allow us to test more quickly.

- Succinct summary or snapshot information about a task or benefit
- Direct link to more detailed information about that task or benefit
- Clear and distinct communication of important information (e.g. payment due or files needed)
- Ability to upload right on the page
- Overview of all content available within dashboard provided by the sidebar navigation
- Recommendations and ancillary information

### Allow users to complete simple tasks on their logged-in homepage, and guide them to dedicated places for more complex tasks and detailed information.

Comparative analysis and user research validated that linking people off to another page to complete more complex tasks, or look at detailed information, is an effective way of guiding users. Users don't mind going to a new page when there is a clear path.



### Offer users some control of their dashboard density.

A common approach we saw in our comparative analysis for dealing with a large amount of information on a dashboard was including an expand/collapse function on containers.  This could be especially useful for users who have multiple benefits and/or cognitive considerations that cause them to be easily overwhelmed.

In both our stakeholder and user interviews, people discussed customization as being useful on a dashboard.  We should keep that in mind as something to explore as the personalized experience matures. 

## Notifications

### Notifications should be at the top of the page, accessible from anywhere.



### Explore additional in-line notifications for important info directly related to items on the users logged-in homepage  



### Notifications need to be consistent with other channels of communication with the VA

Examine all emails, texts and other notifications Veterans are receiving and ensure our notifications align. We don't want to create confusion or mistrust by sending mixed messages.



## Navigation

### Provide an authenticated secondary navigation for the logged-in experience.

- Sidebar navigation well received in blue sky prototype
- Navigation provides an overview of content and structure that users find helpful
- Consistent with what we saw in our comparative analysis



## Profile

### Include an obvious link to a complete profile section from the logged-in homepage.

Participants in our research study weren't interested in seeing all profile information directly on their personalized page, but did want to have access to it via a link.  Some participants weren't at all interested in seeing profile information, so having it accessible, but not visible, on the logged-in homepage would allow those people to keep that info from cluttering their page.

This approach would also align with what we saw in the comparative analysis; most sites we looked at included a link to profile information instead of showing that information directly on the page.

### Ask some focused questions about the placement of dependent information, rated disabilities, and Your VA Medical Center (VAMC) in future conversations with users.

Our study was inconclusive with regards to the best place to put this information. Not all people were interested in the information, and there wasn't a consistent place this was grouped by people who did want to see it. We may need to provide more than one access point to this information to meet user expectations. 

## MVP 2.0

- Consider customization features
- Build out a dedicated notification center
- Navigation will need to be updated

## Process

### User test at every possible stage.  

This page is too important to user test one time. We saw in our research review that the 2018 homepage was tested at least 6 times to get to the right approach. This will also allow us to design with users, build more iteratively, and make meaningful updates.

### Ensure future research studies include Veterans under 34. 

This group was not represented in our initial user study and may reveal additional insights around needs for new Veterans and education benefits.
