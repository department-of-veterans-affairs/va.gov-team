# Logged-in homepage Past Research Review

**Digital Services Veterans Affairs (DSVA), VSA, Authenticated Experience**

Liz Lantz (liz@adhocteam.us), 04/22/2020

## Background

As part of discovery for a new logged-in homepage, we reviewed previous research conducted between 2016-2019. The goal of this review is to establish a foundation for the designer(s) tackling the logged-in homepage redesign, and to guide future user interviews so they are unique and answer new questions.

## Studies Reviewed

### Personalization 2.0

**[Personalization 2.0 Discovery: Summary and Strategy](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/personalization%202.0/discovery-research/README.md)**

- **Goals:** Evaluate usefulness of My VA dashboard and relationship to the homepage, and better understand service member experience vs veteran experience and impacts to our work.
- **Findings**:
  - My VA dashboard isn't used much, and is duplicative of the homepage.  
  - The visual design of My VA isn't scaleable or scannable.  
  - VA.gov users expect an experience tailored to them, and are task-oriented.
  - We need an onboarding experience.

**[Dashboard 2.0 User Interviews Research Summary](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/personalization%202.0/discovery-research/dashboard-interviews/research-summary.md)**

This research rolled up into the larger Personalization 2.0 report linked above and reported similar findings to what is described above.

### Notifications

**[Notification research (March 2018)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Identity/Personalization/Notifications/HCA%20MVP/Research/User%20Notifications%20Readout%20-%20end%20of%20sprint%20demo.pptx)**

- **Goals**: Gain insights into users expectations around notifications from VA.gov.

  - Users are interested in a centralized place online to see statuses.

### Brand Consolidation

5 decks from this research were reviewed, all related to the consolidation effort and redesign of VA.gov.

  - Deep links into eBenefits were not useful.

### My VA Research

**[Original pre-launch usability testing (April 2018)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Identity/Personalization/research/April%202018%20usability/Personalization%20MVP%20readout.pptx)**

**["Find VA Benefits" user testing (September 2018)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Identity/Personalization/Recommendations/Research/MVP%20Research/User%20Testing/Research%20Summary.md)**

- **Findings:**
  - People found the **Update** and **Decision** blocks to be helpful, but had mixed feelings about being able to remove them.

  - We should consider organizing the dashboard by benefit type; the new "Manage your VA Health Care" section of the dashboard met participants' expectations. 
  
### VA Mobile App Discovery  

**[VA Mobile App Discovery: Card Sorting Report (April 2020)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/discovery-sprint/veteran-desirability/card-sorting/VA%20Mobile%20App%20Discovery_%20Card%20sorting%20report.pdf)**

- **Goals:** To evaluate what features veterans might be interested in using  if the VA were to develop a mobile app.
- **Findings:**
  - **Mobile app features people were interested in**: Being able to request military records; having the ability to update contact information; uploading documents; seeing status updates, receiving appointment reminders, and sending secure messages; and getting help in a crisis.

## Journey maps

**[Veteran Journey Map](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)** 

This provides an overview of the 10 life stages any Veteran may encounter.  This is a good resource to build an understanding of how Veteran's needs change over time, and inspire thinking around how our design can adapt to support them through those changes.

**[VA patient experience map](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veterans%20Outpatient%20Journey%20Map.pdf)** 

This resource traces the outpatient experience from the perspective of the employee, and provides insights into painpoints Veterans experience related to receiving care from their provider. 

**Benefit specific journey maps**

Each of the following journey maps go into detail about a specific benefit journey. Journeys begin from application to receipt of benefits, focusing on actions needed and veterans' positive, negative, and neutral feelings. We should use these resources to familiarize ourselves with the processes for each of these benefits and inform how we might highlight them on the new logged-in homepage.

**[Education benefits map](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Edu%20Journey%20Map_110518_v6.pdf)**

## Research done by outside groups

**[Benefit planning, applications, and claims research conducted by Frog in 2016](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/files/4446518/D5_frog_VCRD_ResearchReadout_final.pdf)** (see slides 31-97)

This comprehensive research study goes into great detail around the overall benefit journey, from transition to managing information online.  While we've made improvements since then, there is a lot here that is still relevant to our work on a logged-in homepage update.  Recommendations that are still particularly relevant:

- Serve up benefits information that is personal and relevant to the Veteran based on what is known about each individual.
- Enable Veterans to get snapshot views and take common actions quickly.
- Aggregate personal information and documents in one location.
