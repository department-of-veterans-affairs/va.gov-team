## Questions we were trying to answer

## Product Questions

We're broadly trying to figure out how to create a more useful logged in homepage, one that is the most useful blend of dashboard/personal information and links to tools. We want to do a better job than we are now of showing veterans the full picture of their care at the VA in one place, and a better job of helping them complete the tasks they come to VA.gov to complete.

To help us figure this out, we'd like to better understand:

- Why people come to VA.gov.
- What people do on VA.gov
- How people move through the site.
- How people use the homepage.
- How people use My VA.
- Areas for improvement for existing functionality.
- How people's experience with the site might change if we had a proper notification system.

## Analytics to Track Down

I'm pretty sure most, if not all, of these metrics are already tracked, but we don't know where or how to track them down ourselves. That's where we need your help.

We'd like to know the following:

**General**

- What are the top ~20  pages visited on VA.gov?
  - How does this change if we look at top pages for logged out users vs. logged in users?
- What are the top ~20 search terms on VA.gov? 
- Is there a pattern to where people are in the site when they decide to search?
- What are the top ~20 entry points for VA.gov?
- What are the top ~20 organic search terms people are using to get to VA.gov?
- After people enter the site, what is the next thing they do?
- % of traffic by device (desktop; tablet; mobile).

**Homepage**

- What page do people visit BEFORE the homepage?
- How often is the homepage people's first entry point?
- What do people do from the homepage? (ie. what links do they click?)
- How many people visit the homepage?

**My VA**

- What page do people visit BEFORE My VA?
- Is My VA ever a first entry point?
- What do people do from My VA? (ie. what links do they click?)
- How many people visit My VA? 


## VA.gov: Overall site data

### Top 25 pages: Logged in/logged out combined data

- These results are largely reflect what we have seen in the past the claim status tool is our most popular tool. Other tools that made it into the top 25 include the facility locator, the GI Bill statement of benefits, and the letters tool. Although these tools don't exist on VA.gov, people also wanted to know how to how to view payment history and refill their prescriptions.
- More unexpected: going by pageview, My VA is more popular than we would have expected. This likely indicates an interest in seeing personalized benefit information.
- In terms of "explore" content, how to apply for GI Bill/education benefits, how to apply for disability benefits, and how to apply for a veteran ID card made it into the top 25.

### Top 25 pages: Logged in data only

- The claim status tools is the most popular page outside of the homepage for logged in users.
- Logged in users appear to be on the site primarily to check the status of benefits (claims, GI Bill benefits) or to get their records (download letters).
- On the modernized site, we only see one health tool — refill prescriptions — in the top 25. This is likely because health care is primarily managed on MHV. We should review the non-modernized data to get a more full picture of the importance of health tools.

### Top 25 pages: Logged out data only

- Logged in or logged out, people want to get to the claim status tool.
- Search is much more important for logged out users than logged in users.
- Locating a facility is somewhat more important to logged out than logged in users.
- GI Bill benefits are important to both logged in and logged out users, but logged out users are much more likely to use the GI bill comparison tool, while logged in users want to check the status of their GI bill benefits.
- Logged out users are more interested in exploring benefits and getting information on eligibility and how to apply for them.
- In the case of an emergency, logged out users do look to the VA. The Coronavirus FAQ made it into the top 25 pages even though it had only been around for the last month of the time period for which we pulled data.

### Top 25 entry points 

This data tells us the first page people land on when they come to the modernized VA.gov. This may reflect how people are being directed via search engine results or what pages people have bookmarked.

- Landing pages largely reflect what we see in terms of popularity of pages overall. The homepage, claim status, GI bill benefits, content hubs, DD214 info, and info on the veteran ID card were all in the top 25 list.
- The homepage was the most popular by orders of magnitude, with the claim status tool and the facility locator rounding out the top 3.
- My VA makes a higher appearance on this list than I would have expected, but the raw number of sessions are a minor fraction of people landing on the homepage.
