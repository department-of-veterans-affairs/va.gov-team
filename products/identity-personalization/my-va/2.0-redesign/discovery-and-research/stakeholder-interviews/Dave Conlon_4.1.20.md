# Stakeholder interview with Dave Conlon 4.1.20

### Tell me about your role and what you do in your work on va.gov.

I am the product owner of all-things facilities, so I started with the facility locator, and now I own the VAMC websites as they migrate to Drupal. We’ve got 1 and 8 more in flight right now. We’ll see what happens now with COVID.

### How long have you been in this role?

- Facility locator — October
- VAMC – 1.5 months

### Who are the people and teams you work most closely with?

Also, I am technically the interim product owner of the CMS until Jeff Barnes come back.

I work closely with Public Websites and Content Management teams.

### How were you involved with the vets.gov to va.gov transition, as it pertains to the logged in homepage/myVA experience?

Not involved.

### What problems have you noticed about the current logged in homepage and myVA experiences?

I’ve used it once. I’ve only logged in once.

### How would an update to the logged in homepage experience impact your work?

So in terms of facilities, I work on the brick and mortar side of the house. So a veteran looks at their local VAMC as “My VA.” So part of the logged in experience should be aware of the location of the veteran. So for example in our backlog we have “drop in a cookie to the veterans browser to save this as my preferred VA.” We don’t have that functionality yet, it’s in our backlog to have that “these are the facilities I usually go to for XYZ”. There’s been research on medical side of the house and not benefit side of the house. We’ll see where this goes for vet centers, who don’t have websites and are basically a dot on the map right now. So kind of matching the location and brick and mortar to the online experience.

### What are your goals for a new logged in homepage experience?

No, not really, other than a widget that says what your normal VA locations are and what’s going on there re: facility status (especially with what’s going on now with COVID).

### What does success look like to you? How would you know this project has succeeded?

I mean, part of the online/logged-in experience is to have the self-service tools. To be completely blunt, you’re almost robbing my business, and that’s a good thing. From facility locator or My VAMC page, is “do I actually need to go to a brick-and-mortar” or not. My goal is to help the veteran fix their problem as quickly as possible, whether that is brick and mortar or telehealth. So my goal is to facilitate that to get however they can solve their problem the quickest.

### What logged in homepage/dashboard experiences have you come across that work well, and not so well? How about notifications?

None of the ones I am using currently have been all that wonderful — Massage Envy, LA Fitness, BCBS, generally online learning.
