# Stakeholder interview with Kevin Hoffman 4.1.20

### Tell me about your role and what you do in your work on va.gov.

I am the head of platform. I am currently the only head of platform (because Dror is out). Normally I focus only on design.

Platform focuses on backend systems, API layer, design systems... everything that has to do with providing support for a team. If a team wants to build on the platform, we orient them and (get them started).

### How long have you been in this role?

3 months. I have been at the VA for a year.

### Who are the people and teams you work most closely with?

I work very closely with the platform team specifically. I focus on the product support team, the frontend team, (two other teams I missed). I do a lot with our leadership team, which is comprised of contractor leads.

### How were you involved with the vets.gov to va.gov transition, as it pertains to the logged in homepage/myVA experience?

Not involved.

### What problems have you noticed about the current logged in homepage and myVA experiences?

So I have not spent a whole lot of time… so there are two things you asked… so thinking about the logged in VA homepage and the overall UX. So I would say I have not spent enough time in this space to have opinions about problems. From an outside experience, though, we’ve made the decision to have an integrated experience instead of a silo’d experience. 

My sense of us doing this in an integrated way, IA-wise, things that would only exist for logged in users are somewhat orphaned or sit outside of our UX in a weird way. So the profile page, IDK if this is a problem, but it doesn’t exist if you’re logged out.

From a design system perspective, we have a very form-focused and unauthenticated focused design system. So our system focuses on getting forms up and running so a veteran can go to one place and do their business. Since that was the guiding mission for Vets.gov, that becoming VA.gov is a little different, but the mission of VA.gov is different. It’s bigger than just providing for the business needs in one place. And the audience is bigger. We haven’t put time into designing UI tools/element connecting your identity to an integrated IA. So for example, we have navigation. There’s nothing we have designed at this point (besides Teressa’s work ) to show that something has additional value to you when you’re logged in. So (in the IA/nav) currently we have what’s there, parent/child relationships. In the future, we might want to communicate things like what requires login, or to assess when we would need to do that and why.

Because we designed the equivalent of a “Greek diner” approach to the menu. When I look at our homepage right now, it’s very much a Greek diner menu. You’ve got the most popular items and then you go into a hub pages and you have all of the options. In order to grow, we have to think about where that falls short. And I think it falls short is how we present identity throughout that experience. It’s very much in the background. Our approach to personalization right now is kind of a slight, added enhancement to what we have no instead of assuming personalization from the get go.

I’m trying to think of a good example… Google? (Talked a bit about material design) There’s a layer of personalization that is built into the experience instead of outside of it. We should think about how we integrate identity management into the entire experience. 

### How would an update to the logged in homepage experience impact your work?

One of the things I think will be an ongoing effort is how we manage people’s identity across multiple applications from a backend perspective. We have a team to explore this, so if someone wants to build something that requires (another non-vet identity), making sure our backend systems and API layer are set up to give the right people the right stuff.

Security is obviously an issue.

### What are your goals for a new logged in homepage experience?

One of my goals would be for us to audit the design system for authenticated work, so how identity might affect elements. Looking at the US Design System and see if they are doing anything related to that. Other than that, I would love to see us… for an authenticated homepage specifically, what is the north star guiding how we make decisions. One end of the range would be the minimum changes to support the highest priority auth exp goals. The other end of the spectrum would be a completely different page — what requires immediate attention, what questions of yours have been answered. 

The page we have is a roll of the dice for an unauthenticated user, "we're betting that these are the things you want to do". We probably want to design a page that is very much about what they're there to do and nothing else. Or at least prioritize that content.

### What does success look like to you? How would you know this project has succeeded?

I don’t know! I would love to see where we go. I think one of the coolest things about this work, usually with private sector company, they know they are driving to one kind of experience. The reality of the way stakeholders have in government means the destination is kind of flexible and unknown.

Success for me looks like integrated ease-of-use as opposed to isolated ease-of-use. We’re really good at validating veteran success within application, but this is about veteran success across applications that would allow logical expectations to happen for a user. Example — when I finish a form, I’m given real-time sense of what the next steps are, etc.

### What metrics would you be interested in seeing around a logged in homepage?

I would love to see over time an increase in authenticated users. Over time, more people log in faster. So if the first thing people do is log in, that would indicate we are building the right thing.

As a measure of changed behavior, if we’re building the right authenticated experience, they would login before they do anything else.

### What logged in homepage/dashboard experiences have you come across that work well, and not so well? How about notifications?

Google. The Apple ecosystem has a lot of cross device tools (eg. Interacting with text messages wherever you are). A good notification experience… I haven’t used Android in a while, but I always thought that Android’s experience was better than iOS.

Thinking about:

-	What do you show me first?
-	Why?
-	What happens as a result of this?
-	What is the primary action? How do you present the right primary action?
-	How do you manage expectations so the action gets me where I want?

### What are concerns do you have about this project? What do you imagine going wrong?

Yeah, I feel like this work is that the scope would get out of hand. This is the kind of project that everyone would have an opinion on from the CIO to CTO. So it’ll be important to have a vision and maintain that vision. So there’s a risk of “paralysis by analysis”

The other thing that we need to do is articulating a destination and a journey. Think figuring out the journey for how we roadmap and prioritize. And this all seems related to the mission.

(Clarification — what do you mean by journey?) One of the fears I have for your team is that maybe authority figures will dictate what a thing should be, and I want your team to have space to learn as your team goes along.
