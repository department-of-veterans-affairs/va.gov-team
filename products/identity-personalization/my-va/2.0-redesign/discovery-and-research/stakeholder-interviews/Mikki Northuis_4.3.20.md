# Stakeholder interview with Mikki Northuis 4.3.20

### Tell me about your role and what you do in your work on va.gov.

I am an information architect and I’ve been working on VA.gov and Vets.gov for 3.5 years. I primarily responsible for supporting the veteran-facing teams that are building stuff on VA.gov and helping them place their tools within the structure/navigation.

### How long have you been in this role?

3.5 years.

### Who are the people and teams you work most closely with?

Mostly with the designers and product managers. Also, I work a lot with content people, but now there aren’t a lot of content writers on different teams, so they are mostly with public websites.

### How were you involved with the vets.gov to va.gov transition, as it pertains to the logged in homepage/myVA experience?

I wasn’t involved a ton on the authenticated side, but I was heavily involved in the consolidation of Vets.gov into VA.gov. But not the authenticated side — that mostly stayed as is. But on the unauth side, we modernized content, structure, URLs.

[RE: the project overall] I wouldn’t say I lead things by any means, but I worked heavily on it. It was lead heavily on the DSVA side. I worked with a writer/editor heavily.

### What problems have you noticed about the current logged in homepage and myVA experiences?

It’s not any different from the unauth homepage. Right now, the unauthenticated homepage focuses on top tasks, but there are a lot more. Applying for healthcare is relevant one time, but then you need to manage your care. The homepage focuses on those buckets, and we don’t see people using the main nav a lot. (So we are missing the opportunity to get people to other tools).

### Can you tell me about the work you are doing to flatten the IA?

To be transparent, I am not doing a lot of this work right now. I am trying to get someone to help me get support for this work. 

And it’s not about flattening the IA. It’s about decoupling the tools from the benefit hubs, so the benefit hubs can be about exploring and applying because once you’ve done that, you ‘re done with it. Then you need a profile (so you can manage things). So the idea behind what we are calling “global IA” work is decoupling the manage tasks from the explore side so we can better bubble up tasks for people who have already applied for something so they can track and manage it.

### What is your ideal logged in experience?

Off the top of my head, I don’t have a plan in mind for that, but I know several people do. I think that once you have applied for a benefit, there are a lot of things that you can or should do, and we don’t bring those things front and center for you. But we’ve never put a lot of emphasis on getting a profile or getting logged in. It’s just something that happens if you can find it. Now is a great time to start promoting the fact that you can create an account or profile on VA.gov and what that brings you, eg. Interacting with your physician.

### Has there been any conversation re: COVID around signing up?

Not that I’m aware of.

### How would an update to the logged in homepage experience impact your work?

I mean, I think that the biggest question I have is what tools are really part of managing your benefits vs. managing your profile? We have things like update your direct deposit or add a dependent. Historically, adding a dependent is about compensation, but do people think of it that way? Or do they think of it as adding a dependent to their profile at VA? So I’m interested in what people think of managing their benefits vs. managing their profile at the VA, and what they think would impact my work. I don’t want users to have to go through a benefit to find a task they need to do.

### What does success look like to you? How would you know this project has succeeded?

We would see a lot more profiles created and a lot more signed in sessions. We would start to see an uptick in traffic to online tools and a downtick in phone calls. 

### What metrics would you be interested in seeing around a logged in homepage?

Besides those? I’d like to know what we place on the homepage — what is getting attention vs. what’s not so we can continue to evolve. E.g. We have supplemental claims in the top 20 tasks — should that be there or should we move it out?

There are also some things that are more cyclical in nature — edu benefits are a thing in the spring and the summer, so it trends. (Implication: what can we do with this?)

### What logged in homepage/dashboard experiences have you come across that work well, and not so well? How about notifications? 

Not that I can think of. I think of the use case for VA.gov matches those financial institutions. Retailers have been doing authenticated work for years, but it’s still about shopping (and heavily leans on exploring). VA.gov use case is closer to those financial institutions. Once you’ve created an account, you’re tracking on the maintenance of that.

### What might make this project easier or harder in any specific ways, as it relates to your role on va.gov, or your team?

The hardest thing about this work effort, from an IA perspective, it’s more than just the authenticated experience this impacts. We (me and Andy) looked at how unauth impacts auth. It also affects how Jen Lee might do work on the hubs. So there’s a lot of other work efforts that are in flight or planned that are impacted by this work. So that’s the challenge with how to approach it when every team is in a different place right now.

When it comes to an auth homepage, I’ve always been of the opinion that our homepage needs to look like a homepage. On Vets.gov, the homepage was replaced with a dashboard experience. I want to know when people click on the breadcrumb or logo, they should know they are back on the homepage.

### What about banking logged in experiences/homepages?

(Talked about how banks still have a homepage and sites still have header/footer that let you know where you are)

### What are concerns do you have about this project? What do you imagine going wrong?

I don’t think so because I want to see it go forward so bad! We have been talking about moving the dial on the authenticated experience for some time, and I am ready to see it go.

### Is there anyone else you think we should talk to?

Danielle Thierry — she just rejoined the effort. She was a big part of the consolidation work for Vets.gov  VA.gov. She’s now joined USDS as a content strategist for the VA.
