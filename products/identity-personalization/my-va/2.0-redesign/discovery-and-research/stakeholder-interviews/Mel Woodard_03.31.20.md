# Stakeholder interview with Mel Woodard 3.31.20

#### Tell me about what you the work you did for va.gov as it relates to the blue sky prototype you created

When I worked on this, I was working with Suzanne Chapmen, and tasked by Charles and Marcy to come up with a vision for the 21st century of the VA could look like online. Intention was that it would be something they could share w the secretary of the VA at the time to get buy in for the work that they were doing
Big drive was toward a more personalized experience for vets on va.gov

Work on the concepts was not a exactly a proof of concept, but more "this is a vision we can have conversations around"

#### How were you involved with the vets.gov to va.gov transition, as it pertains to the logged in homepage/myVA experience ?

Left the team around the time when things were really starting to kick up. Was involved with some really early design explorations for a va.gov homepage.  There were a couple of stages of those explorations for the homepage design. A year and change before transition took place, ideas started to bubble up.

The work was making the homepage as a base to get out to do all the things.  There was a desire to create a perception that you can access all of the services from this page.  Did some brief design explorations there, and there were talks that we’d rush to launch in 2 months but that didn’t end up happening. We postponed, and then the following spring those convos started to gain momentum again. 

Worked closely with Andy [Lewandowski] for a while, he had developed some mockups for what va.gov would look like. Mel contributed more in a visual design capacity to align to the design system to his ideas, and try to make it less overwhelming, and more accessible for people to understand *all the things* available on that page.

#### What problems have you noticed about the current logged in homepage and myVA experiences?

Totally unfamiliar with how they looked now

#### What logged in homepage/dashboard experiences have you come across that work well, and not so well? How about notifications?

Can’t think of any off the top of her head. Mel did some competitive analysis for this but not sure where it is - maybe in Github, or maybe somewhere in her computer?

Looked at financial, medical sector, insurance websites, and some more less traditional services like PayPal, and Square

#### Can you show me some of your designs and talk about why you made some of those decisions?

(Discussing [personalization blue sky prototype](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/d/main?origin=v7#/projects/prototypes/13596891?scrollOffset=216))

As we were working through the concepts, we were on the fly trying to come up with things that would be useful for Veterans to see. We broke it [dashboard](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/images/personalization-blue-sky-dashboard.png) down into a few different buckets (shown as columns) we thought would be most useful: 

- First bucket is the middle column, here are all your status updates on current benefits that you're using

  -  linked from Overview in side nav
  - Giving people important status updates on those things

- Top right column (second bucket) points people toward other benefits they might be able to engage with that they're not currently usinghas recommendations, thinking things that would be relevant based on what we know about the logged in user. 

- Third bucket is at the bottom of the right column, and at the top of the page Including a localized aspect to show local events and their VA facility 

- [Profile page](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/images/personalization-blue-sky-profile%402x.png), with the `% complete`, thinking there was an idea to create incentivize users to complete their profile to offer a more personalized, relevant experience if we had all of that information

  - The more we know about you, the more we can give you a jumpstart to benefits

- [Documents page](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/images/personalization-blue-sky-documents%402x.png) - fuzziest on this one. There's an equivalent experience existed in eBenefits.  

  - Design infers that we'll also see some documents that came from the DoD, documents you uploaded, or docs from secure messaging. This would be the place to house all of the docs and was mapped more like an equivalent feature to what exists in eBenefits

- Health care team secure [messaging](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/images/personalization-blue-sky-inbox%402x.png) - idea was to demonstrate that starting from the dashboard  you can use the side nav to get to all of these tools.  

  - Making it feel like it's all part of the same space rather than navigating out to separate applications
  - Clicking from the message card on the homepage would lead you straight to the [message detail](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/images/personalization-blue-sky-secure-messages-detail%402x.png)

- [Prescriptions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/images/personalization-blue-sky-prescriptions%402x.png) - if you wanted to see details on all of your prescriptions, it would be on this view

  - Doesn't recall about package tracking or if that was a feature that could be provided

  #### Have you worked on anything similar to this on other (non-VA) projects? What worked/didn't work?

  Nope, haven't worked on anything similar
