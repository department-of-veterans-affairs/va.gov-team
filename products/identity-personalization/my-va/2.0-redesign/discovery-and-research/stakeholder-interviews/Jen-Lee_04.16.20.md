# Stakeholder interview with Jen Lee, 4/16/20

#### Tell me about your role and what you do in your work on va.gov

I'm the Product Owner of Public Websitess and started VA from USDS as a content designer on the public websites team, there were a few app teams in place. Joined right as the va.gov first iteration was launching.

#### How long have you been in this role? 

Joined november 2018

#### Who are the people and teams you work most closely with?

At DEPO - platform, and the CMS team not so much anymore the VAMC team but last year, worked a lot with them. Now, less so the apps, but still continuing some interaction with the auth apps teams just because we have some overlaps

At VA - it’s broad. people at VBA, VHA, NCA, OPIA, VEO.  These are administration level, when I say VBA, it really means dozens of business lines, right? The VBA has dozens of business lines that we work with at this point.  VHA has so many business lines including the medical center. And every medical center has their own digital “web team” - a public affairs team.

#### How were you involved with the vets.gov to va.gov transition, as it pertains to the logged in homepage/myVA experience ?

Not the logged in experience at all. To be honest, when they were launching VA.gov they were so crazy frantic busy I don’t know if there was any work done on the authenticated side. For myself, I had always  assumed that the authenticated experience was different from the public experience because that’s the private sector model. You know, you go to, Amex, what you see after you sign in is completely different from this public facing site. I thought our experience was like that. It’s only been within the last maybe 7 or 8 months that I learned that the navigation and IA of the logged in experience is maybe not exactly, but very closely mirrors the public experience, And in fact you’re basically navitating the public site when you’re logged in.  It kind of blew my mind.  I was not expecting it to be like that.



#### What problems have you noticed about the current logged in homepage and myVA experiences?

I've logged in a few times. The things that I find always weird are that I sign in and I’m on a page that looks exactly like the page I was on when I signed in. And then I have to click somewhere else to get the tool that I thought I was signing into. 

##### Do you see that as a problem? Can you elaborate? 

Yeah. Initially, I was really confused. I didn’t know there was a state change. I thought I had signed in, so I wondered why aren’t I seeing the signed in experience. I didn’t realize that the signed in experience was actually the same thing.  Also, I was assuming that once I signed in through that React widget to access a tool, that it would take me straight to the tool. Maybe for some tools it does that, but in the instance where I tried it, it didn’t do that.  I landed on a page that looked like the unauthenticated page and I had to click one more time  to go through the tool itself from there.

**Did you check out myVA at all? Do you recall looking at that?**

Didn’t look at myVA.  It’s hard to find. I know where it is now, but it actually took different people pointing out to me where it was after I couldn’t find it.  

**Are there any other problems you've noticed about the logged in homepage experience?**

I actually don't know what the logged-in homepage looks like. I've never logged in just straight to the homepage. I've always done it though a tool landing page, and that doesn't take you to the homepage. It takes you to, it keeps you on the page you were on unauthenticated, but you're now logged in.

*(learns it is exactly the same).*

 I don’t know if veterns would find that confusing but I found it confucsing because it doesn’t map to other private sector baselines that I have experienced. I feel like with other audiences, we can always assume they have a rich digital life outside of your companies experiences, so of course we want to be using the same best practices and models. Sometimes i really wonder with the Veteran audience because in a few cases it’s been tremendously eye opening that it doesn’t work for them always.



#### How would an update to the logged in homepage experience impact your work?

It probably will, but I don’t know in what way. I kind of wish they [authenticated experience ] would just create their own website [website = experience on va.gov]. Mikki and i have discussed - should use the same taxonomy, nomenclature, labeling, categorization, but my opinion is they should have their own site experience. They should have totally unique nav, using the same labeling and taxonomy, a nav that is very unique and totally focused on tasks and transitions. These tasks and transactions don’t need to be embedded in content pages. 

They shouldn’t be using the same IA and menu as the public website.  They should have their own website experience that is about "okay you’re logged in, you have a VA account, here are all your benefits and services you can do tasks on" just like Kaiser or car insurance sites.  You don’t have to navigate through marketing information to pay your bills or update your account info

**If the authenticated experience was totally different, and as you described, do you think people would still have the same access to all these tools and calls to sign in on your content pages? Would that all say the same?**

For a certain interim period of time, it should continue to provide access points into those tools from those content pages. The reason I say that is because a lot of veterans and family members, and va employees, don’t even know that there are lots of services and benefit tasks that now VA offers online.  They just automatically go look for a paper form. Which that is why that find a va forms product gets tremendous search value, because people are actually looking for forms to do basic things like renew their insurance. They don’t even know they can do it online. 

I think for a certain period of time, I don’t know what that period should be, we do need to provide access points to tools from content. It provides some search value and awareness value, at least until it becomes more of a common known experience that, "hey, you can do all your things at the VA online, if you have an online account." Maybe at that point people will maybe just sign in and bypass the public website experience which is the ultimate goal we’re going for.

And then, at that point, the public website, becomes maybe content for people who don’t have benefits yet and to support people who do have benefits but need health information, learning, or support information and troubleshooting information, things like that.

#### What are your goals for a new logged in homepage experience?

I can’t speak to it, because I don’t know what it is right now.  I would love it if our signed in dashboard acted like a personalized signed in dashboard.  You get there and you have access to all the tasks from the navigation, but maybe from the page it’s floating up things that you do frequently or need to do right away. Maybe there’s an appt reminder, or a notice that your Rx is about to run out, or you have a message from your doctor, or "hey, your claim status has changed. It went from pending to complete."

#### What does success look like to you? How would you know this project has succeeded?

One, is it doesn’t look exactly like the page you signed in from on the public experience.  If I sign in from a content page, like a tool landing page, for me success would look like, "Okay I’m on the public website refill your rx content page, I sign in from that react widget, and I immediately go to that tool."  That would be successful. 

Versus, "I sign in from the homepage, or I sign in from the megamenu (which is tool agnostic) that takes me to my personalized dashboard, the authenticated homepage. And it looks different from the public homepage - it's just tasks. It’s a real dashboard. Simple desires.

#### What metrics would you be interested in seeing around a logged in homepage?

Certainly I would want to see where they’re coming from when they sign in - what page they’re coming from. That could inform work that we do on public website with regard to helping to optimize that funnel

This is not specific to the signed in experience, but I’d love to know how many people create accounts or attempt to create an account and don't finish, (abandonment on profile creation).  From where do they begin to do that, that could inform public website work on how to optimize that funnel.

#### What logged in homepage/dashboard experiences have you come across that work well, and not so well? How about notifications?

- I love Ally online banking. They’re fully digital. They’re logged in experience is easy to use.
- Kaiser is worth it because so many VA things are health related. Any health related company would be valuable
- eTrade, Schwab is horrible.  

#### What might make this project easier or harder in any specific ways, as it relates to your role on va.gov, or your team?

I hope it doesn’t [make things harder]. If we lost our only UX designer to this project permanently it would definitely make it harder.



#### What concerns do you have about this project? What do you imagine going wrong?

Potentially losing the UX designer.

**Any risks that come to mind?**

Maybe one risk is that transition from unauth to auth - making sure that Veterans don’t get confused. I feel like most would not because it does map tothe current experience of ecommerce and digital things, but I think this is really new for VA, so that’s what I would be concerned about.  I think they’re really used to is logging into MHV. They’re really used to logging into different websites for their separate tasks - eBenefits, MHV. We’re trying to bring those together into a VA.gov signed in experience, so that would be a concern for me, like “do they get that? Is it confusing for them, is it better for them?”

Some of the Atlas brand research that was done in 2017, Veterans complained about the different sites they had to log into for different tasks, which is the whole point of this consolidation effort, but I know that, you know, Veteran’s love MHV and this will be different.

#### Is there anyone else you think we should talk to?

- Mikki for sure, 
- Peggy has a lot of experience with the authenticated, cuz she worked on both public and applications.
- Danielle. And Danielle actually worked on Vets.gov so she would bring information about that goes back even further.
- Lisa Koenigsberg - there was a day when Andy, Lisa, Samara and I did a walkthrough of a wall with print out and sketches and we talked about what we envisioned for an authenticated experience. Lisa’s was inline with what Andy envisioned too.
