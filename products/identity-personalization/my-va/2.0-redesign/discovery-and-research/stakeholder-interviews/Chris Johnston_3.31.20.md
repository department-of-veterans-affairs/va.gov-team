# Stakeholder interview with Chris Johnston 3.31.20 

### Tell me about your role and what you do in your work on va.gov.

I am the lead for the VA.gov team. I look at the primary product that the DEPO office is responsible for, so creating, managing, maintaining, and enhancing for a veteran or external user who is responsible for managing their VA stuff.

### How long have you been in this role?

Less than a year, I guess.

### Who are the people and teams you work most closely with?

All the people and all the teams! Everybody.

### How were you involved with the vets.gov to va.gov transition, as it pertains to the logged in homepage/myVA experience?

It started as just a small group of us challenge with the notion of how do we get more veterans or more users to access the tools the Vets.gov team had created. It was a user based, transactional system, but it was still 5th in a list of 5 tools in terms of overall traffic, so VA.gov, eBenefits, MHV was still above all of them. Through some research, veterans didn’t care about all of the brands and wanted to find all of their stuff in one place, so we set out on the mission of working across the agency to collapse all of these things into one site. So the Vets.gov thing was a bit of self-sacrifice to throw away the Vets.gov brand and look and feel and migrate all the stuff to VA.gov and convince the agency that this is the one place that veterans should come to learn about all this stuff.

There was a pretty healthy debate about what the homepage could be and should be. I think we made it pretty clear that we wanted there to be an obvious way where veterans could access stuff pretty easy. This is where the top tasks idea came from. The notion that we were trying was a little bit of a private sector thing. Your bank is the easiest analogy — so I can login, pay a bill, or check on a statement, make a deposit, send a message, or do all of those things — so it should be the same thing on VA.gov. The reason we opted to put it on the unauthenticated homepage is because not that many people logged in. People didn’t know they could/should log in or have an identity with which to log in. It seemed to early to force people to have that be the way to find their top tasks, so we put the top tasks out on the unauthenticated space.

### What problems have you noticed about the current logged in homepage and myVA experiences?

So things I’ve heard are mostly anecdotal. 

-	People don’t know it’s there (note: he is talking about My VA), so they don’t know to find it because top tasks are on the unauthenticated homepage so the unauthenticated homepage is where people end up going.
-	Two, is that there is confusion about what is on the profile, what’s on the dashboard, what’s on the account page, so we don’t have pages set up to match the veterans mental model.
-	Next, I think there is a lack of information. We know more about veterans than we’re showing them and they’re expecting to some of that stuff. They’re expecting to see more than we know or could show, but they’re expecting to see more there.
-	And then finally, I think the last big thing that is missing is  some kind of notification or messaging system where we have new info that either veterans need to know or act upon or have an effective way of telling them.

### How would an update to the logged in homepage experience impact your work?

My work is all of VA.gov and I look at things in a few different areas — benefit tools, health tools, and the authenticated experience. It’s a thing that veterans need that they don’t know that they need. As others in the org have things that veterans need to know about, this is where it would be. (listed examples)

### What are your goals for a new logged in homepage experience?

What we were talking about before you joined was how people would go to the top tasks in the unauth experience. I think the goal is to make sure that all of the top things that veterans want or need to do are quickly and easily accessible for veterans. I don’t know that you could really have more that 20 top tasks for veterans, but you may have veterans that are interested in [certain benefits] and not others, so you could make it more personal to your experience.

### What does success look like to you? How would you know this project has succeeded?

How do we measure it? So, the outcomes of a logged in homepage are that… the mushy one is that veterans feel they can understand their standing with the VA across all of the things. They know their standing with the VA, their info is correct/accurate/up to date, they feel they have a path to ask questions or challenge… and I would sum all that up in to some measure of trust. They have trust that they can understand their relationship with the Va through tis.

### What metrics would you be interested in seeing around a logged in homepage?

Metrics — How much does a page get used? How many people log in? Probably a trailing indicator around satisfaction that we get through various surveys. Probably for any given task, there are probably usage metrics, so for notifications, are they reading/responding/taking action. And that’s for any kind of things (e.g. Claims).

### What logged in homepage/dashboard experiences have you come across that work well, and not so well? How about notifications?

Examples I typically use are most banking examples — account summary, drill down into details, recent transactions, separate sections for paying a bill, applying for a thing, talking to a rep. There is a bit of an analogy there because there are multiple things, so there is a corollary to VA business lines.

With VA.gov, there’s an “upsell”… if you log in, you can check your claim, refill your RX, etc.

Bad logged in experiences — Old school, customizable Yahoo dashboards with a bunch of widgets you could add. It was customization, not personalization, which wasn’t valuable at all.

Another example — Financial investment sites that are MVP and pretty, but don’t have the info you’d expect.

### What might make this project easier or harder in any specific ways, as it relates to your role on va.gov, or your team?

One thing that makes it easier is that it is pretty green-field. VA.gov has never really had this. We have an opportunity to do something really comprehensive across the VA. We have cart blanche across the VA.

What makes it hard is that it’s across VA, so people have a lot of opinions about what should be there, so it might become a dumping ground.

### What are concerns do you have about this project? What do you imagine going wrong?

My only concern is one of speed. I think we’re at the point where we really need something improved over what we have. I would be sad if we spent a year trying to make this perfect without making anything incrementally better at all.

### Is there anyone else you think we should talk to?

Kevin, John, Andy (already on the list).

Maybe non-DEPO — someone in VEO? Maybe Denise Kitts or Laura Pretula.
