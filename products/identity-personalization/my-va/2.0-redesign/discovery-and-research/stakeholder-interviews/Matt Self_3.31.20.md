# Stakeholder interview with Matt Self 3.31.20

### Tell me about your role and what you do in your work on va.gov.

I’m one of the product leads under the BAM portfolio, so I am with the BAM2 team working on various benefit applications, tools, and services.

(Are you on the education team?) Yes, that falls under our portfolio, but that work is being done by a different team (Booz Allen Hamilton). So yes, I kind of have 2 teams — one is a BAH team that… [didn’t get the rest of this]

### How long have you been in this role?

2 years

### Who are the people and teams you work most closely with?

Both teams are comprised of the same set of disciplines — for BAM2, Leah Keeler is the PM, a couple designers, and the 2 or 3 engineers.

BAH – They are organized basically the same. They have Darryl running day to day, he’s in team of teams…

### How were you involved with the vets.gov to va.gov transition, as it pertains to the logged in homepage/myVA experience?

I didn’t work on that initiative, but I was here for it.

### What problems have you noticed about the current logged in homepage and myVA experiences?

One that is foremost in my mind is that when you log in vs not, it’s kind of an identity crisis of which one should be your de facto set of stuff. It feels disjointed that you have two hubs from which you can do everything, but they’re different. But besides that… I feel like in comparison to other websites that we all visit, the logged in experience doesn’t take as many opportunities to capitalize on the fact that you are logged in. Maybe there are opportunities to do things besides (prefill) that we could technically do because we know the information but we don’t have a design paradigm to take advantage of it.

### How would an update to the logged in homepage experience impact your work?

One that I’ve been thinking about is I was curious to see if you guys have plans to take advantage of iconography, like stuff I was describing — Oh, you have a new claim, highlighting like a “1” or a “2” would be useful for the new project we’re talking about because we are implementing some notification capability. When you come to the website, do we notify you that these things are in your file? Depending on what you’re thinking about, that might be relevant.

We are working on the debt letters MPV. Basically veterans can incur debt with the VA. We’re going to be building a landing page to alert veterans that “hey you have a new debt letter on file, go see where it is.”

### What are your goals for a new logged in homepage experience?

(Besides debt letter experience) Continued access to the most important things. I do like that regardless of what homepage is and where we have it, I like that I is data drive and I want that to be the case when we redesign it. I always here from veterans that that page is really valuable.

I like the thought of being able to have those most important things — so being able to apply to 526 — being the forefront on the homepage, but if you’re logged in, being able to have the same destination so have that be relevant to your situation. So instead of apply for disability, it might be “view the latest update to your claim”. Going back to logged in and logged out being the same thing but minding those kinds of differences that take advantage of the person being logged in but with the same context.

### What does success look like to you? How would you know this project has succeeded?

More people logging in. We spend a lot of time and language on our forms trying to convince people why that is important and why that results in a better experience, but a lot of people don’t do it. I know a lot of that has to do with login challenges, which we can’t do a lot about. If we can design something that we can get them to login, that to me would be a strong indicator you’ve done something right.

### What metrics would you be interested in seeing around a logged in homepage?

Not sure.

### What logged in homepage/dashboard experiences have you come across that work well, and not so well? How about notifications?

I really like Bank of America. I think Bank of America does a good job. Everything is action-oriented, either their app of their website. They do a really good job of letting you know when/if things have changed. I feel like there is always a good correlation of things that I have done and being able to see that stuff presented to me so I can do something with it.

I can’t think of the top of my head of a bad example.

### What might make this project easier or harder in any specific ways, as it relates to your role on va.gov, or your team?

As it relates to my team’s work, just a better sense of what you’re thinking so that tie in I just mentioned — that’s something we want to explore, but I don’t even know if that’s what you’re considering. So I guess just more visibility about the ideas you guys are thinking about.

### What are concerns do you have about this project? What do you imagine going wrong?

I don’t know…. The login/identity stuff is annoying and kind of hairy and we don’t have a lot of control over it.

It’s just general feedback we get— when we do testing, a lot of times they have challenges getting through 2FA or that you have to set that up, or don’t trust the third-party provider for any reason, there are SSO issues depending on where you login. Login is really a mess at the VA.
