# Stakeholder interview with John Hashimoto 4.14.20

### Where are you coming from? 

CNN digital here in Atlanta. Spent most of my career in the news media industry. Over the past 10 years, I’ve been doing product development work.

### Is this your first government job?

It is.

### Do you have a background in creating logged in experiences/personalization?

Briefly at CNN, we were kind of teasing a logged in experience for CNN.com. I would have called it more discovery for what the experience is for that. But I didn’t spend a year on personalization.

### What will your focus be on VA.gov?

Jen and I are letting it play out a bit. But as you know, we’ve talked about two projects to start rolling. Once is moving wizards. A bigger one is site search. Then, probably in a couple weeks, we’ll look at the playing field and figure out a few things to hand my way.

### Have you logged in to VA.gov?

I did register because I wanted to peak behind the scenes. There’s obviously the health platform, is there a separate logged in experience? Because I haven’t experienced it. 

**[Liz explained how to log in and a bit more about the logged in experience]**

### Can you talk about what your ideal experience for a logged in experience would be? Or things you were exploring at CNN?

I’ll start with CNN. Obviously, there wasn’t transaction information, so no payment info or anything transactional in nature. Mostly, CNN would have been like “I follow these topics, and when I log in, I get a section with those topics.”

For VA.gov, it would be very transactional — records, processes as I apply (lists benefits). I would expect a logged in dashboard (like a bank website).

### What goals would you have for a logged in homepage experience?

It should be obvious how to log in. Most consumers like me are used to using  a saved password, so that’s an important feature so if it doesn’t become a barrier. I would expect the kind of transactions and processes, once I am logged in, to be pretty well spelled out. Before login, maybe there is a notification signal that there is something new here, something to prompt me to log in. 

### What metrics would you be interested in seeing?

How many people register for the logged in experience. In a sense, what they’ve said up if there is customization or tailoring — what have they set up? What are they clicking in the logged in experience? Are there barriers or abandonment issues? Are there areas of frustration that we could fix up?

### I’m curious about your perspective around informing people on “what’s new” coming from a news background. Any thoughts?

If there are features you want to promote to the veteran so they’ll know it’s there and poke around in that. You’re gonna know what their interest is either by their set up or the processes they involved in. Presumably, we’ll know what to bubble up automatically.

### At CNN, did you do research around user behavior and bubbling up stuff?

We did not.

### Are there any dashboard/logged in experiences that you think work well?

Delta is pretty good. I’m a frequent flyer, so there are a lot of elements that work quite well. Some of that works in real life, right? The understanding of who this passenger is and what tier they are, and then tailoring an experience towards that.

Bank of America, I find the BOA relatively good. It surfaces the things I need to know about.

By comparison, one experience I remember is bad for me was AT&T.

I’ve just talked about big, Fortune 100 companies. But you know when you’re using an AirBNB it’s going to be better. Airbnb is good. Maybe hotels.com. It’s OK. It could be better.

### What could make this redesign easier or harder?

It’s going to require great collaboration. I suspect in the past year, the ownership of the homepage was one team. This offers the opportunity to share “making it as great as it can be” collaboration. So that might be it – how can we collaborate to make the homepage great for the veteran?

### What concerns do you have about this project? What could go wrong?

Managing the various stakeholders and players who have a perspective who have a POV about this and trying to navigate all that. That’ll probably be one of the harder aspects of this.

Given the diversity of the user base, you’re going to have to figure out how to keep the user satisfied given the broad diversity among veteran levels — younger veterans, older veterans, digital native veterans.
