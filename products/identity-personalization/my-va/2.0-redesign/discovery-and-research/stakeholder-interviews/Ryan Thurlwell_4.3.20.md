## Interview 2 - 4.3.2020

### Any additional thoughts since our last meeting?

I think we left off talking about service design.  All the touch points - that's where you lose the most trust. (Talks about the need for consistency across branding, consistency, and touch points to establish trust. Gives examples of variety of emails sent out by VA, lack of consistent branding, etc)

### How would an update to the logged in homepage experience impact your work?

It would impact my work in the sense that I would love to design it.  (Talked about how chaotic things are with so many teams, but feels things will get more organized as they move forward).  

Our main goal is to enable folks like you [contractors] to do the things that you do.  I would imagine the authenticated experience would come from DEPO as a collective. We'll figure that out as we go. 

### How about impacts to your work/involvement with the design system?

Instead of this [design system] being the last thing we think about, how do we make this the first thing that we do? How do we make the components useful things that we can put out in the wild sooner so people can start using them and we can learn from them? (Talked about the alert/sign in widget that are part of the identity path) We need to standardize what that means to be signed in. What that looks like to be signed in on a tool page.  

One of Andy's ideas was "how does the healthcare hub change for me if I'm signed in" If you're enrolled we don't need to be asking you if you're eligible.

Something to always bear in mind for this work is that we’re constantly balancing what’s best for Veterans with the business which are not always aligned. Sometimes we have to throw the business a bone. Sometimes that’s what you see when you look at the pages, a compromise you had to make. You have to pick your battles and fight the one that matters.

Also think about the organic search results. How are people getting into VA.gov? Now, it’s [the site] has been there for a while, we know the top clicks, what can we infer from that data? The fact that everyone is going to the menu to drill down to what they want, says that they’re skipping all those tasks and know where they want to go.

This is only going to be effective if we re-work the IA. Andy, Jen and I have always talked about the benefit hubs as products, which they are not now. The profile page is a product too. You do specific things on that page that aren’t part of anything else.  The idea of a product page design, and that has two versions, auth and unauthenticated. 

### Would it be fair to say one of your goals for a new logged in experience would be changing the hub pages to a product page design, and the authenticated pages would have its own separate product design? 

It's overlap with that - there's a duality there. Sorry, this started with your question about the design system - getting all of the teams to start to work in a way where they're not dependent (on the design system) on what exists, but they can build something new. Sign in widget is a good example - hey now that we have all these alerts, this isn't serving it's purpose anymore.  We have no process in place to make that happen now though. (Talks about process shortcomings and finding ways to make design easier for designers, and challenges of collaborating on Slack)

Trying to find a way to spin up a logged in experience where - what does it look like in the nav, on a product page, on a tool? An idea Andy had that I thought was brilliant, if there's a notification about your appeals claim, when you click it, it shouldn't take you to your profile page, it should take you to the claims page, but what does that look like? What if you have several notifications about that? Or appointments, right? You've canceled and made several appoints, so you think of VAOS, what if you have several appointments at the top? This goes back to the product/tool page design.

### Do you have any specific goals for the logged in homepage, around functionality, changing user behavior, things you'd like to see on it?

Nothing beyond what we've already discussed. It seems like everyone has the same mental model of what it means to be logged in.

### What does success look like to you? How would you know this project has succeeded?

People are signing in automatically. Like my bank. I don't think I could even tell you what my bank looks like in an unauthenticated state.

### What metrics would you be interested in seeing around a logged in homepage?

It'd be interesting to see if logged in users started getting more adjacent benefits because we surface the contextual relevance, did you know there’s a home loan or you might qualify for this other thing, to see if those kinds of numbers go up because they don’t have to just discover them in the hub, it’s being surfaced for them. 

### What might make this project easier or harder in any specific ways, as it relates to your role on va.gov, or your team?

- It’s hard for me to let things go when I think I can design things better. I’m very opinionated and often wrong but often right.
- (Goes on to discuss challenges of folks working in silos and not seeing design work in progress once handed off to team)
- Being transparent. This is about our process and we need to find better ways to have design critique and review and talk about things
- There is also a design and technical debt issue. Something I’d like to see instilled in this process and part of everything, is that we need to some sprints dedicated to documentation, fixing old shit, and now that we’ve built it and it’s out in the world, what are we doing?

### What are concerns do you have about this project? What do you imagine going wrong?

Nothing I haven't mentioned already. I'll probably think about this and come up with something a week later.
