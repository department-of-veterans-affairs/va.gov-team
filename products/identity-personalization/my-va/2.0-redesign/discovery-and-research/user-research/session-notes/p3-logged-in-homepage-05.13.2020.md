**Note-taker: Riley Orr**

## Notes
**Note:** Notes begin after the Moderator began recording the screen/audio. 

  - *Start recording.*

**M:** I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?
**P:** Yes.

**M:** Before we start the activities I mentioned, I'd like to ask a few questions about how you use VA.gov and the benefits you receive.

**M:**  Do you remember the last time you visited VA.gov. What were you doing?

**P:** I do, I don’t remember the exact time. I have the screen up right now. Well, since I’ve been part of the VA system I’m done a few things like collecting GI Bill, but that’s no longer something I’m doing. I do use it when I go, 90% of the time it’s my link to MyHeatheVet. I use it to get into my medical record, refill prescriptions, things like that. I know there’s other things, but I don’t use them.

The one thing about how it’s designed now is it’s great because, like I said I’m not using GI Bill, but it’s nice.. had I not done it yet there’s a nice prompt that it’s available to me. If it weren’t visible, I don’t know. 

**M:** When you say you want to comment on how it’s designed now, what are you talking about?

**P:** Well, right now when you log in it’s broken down into healthcare, disability records, and links that take you to one location or another. It’s nice as a reminder of the things available to you. 

**M:**  Do you remember if you logged in?

**P:** Yes. When you go to log into VA.gov it asks you how you want to log in. 3-4 options.. I usually use My HealtheVet password because that’s the one I have written down.

**M:** Can you explain whether or not that was a typical experience for you?

**P:** Yes! 

-   Tell me about some other times you've gone to the site.<br?
N/A
-   How about other times you've logged in? <br>
N/A
-   When you visit the site, how often do you sign in?<br>
N/A

**M:** And last but not least, can you tell me about the benefits you currently receive?

**P:** Sure, I’m not… I’ve used a few different things that are VA Benefits, but I don’t go crazy if that makes sense. I get the healthcare through the VA. I use that to review and schedule appointments occasionally, order medications as needed once every 3-4 months. Not too demanding on that end. I’ve used GI Bill but I haven’t used VA.gov for that. As far as disability benefits go, I am service connected but only 10%. That was done a few years ago so I don’t typically go in to view my benefits but I know I can view my payment history and things like that. I would use it to go in to find my original disability letter if I were to apply for a job within the VA. And then, records… I was in there recently to look at… I work at the VA in administration… a coworker asked me about the health information exchange so I found that through VA.gov as well. 

**M:** Can you share why you feel a personalized page is the way to go?

**P:** I know a couple years ago the eligibility side of the VA set up a personalized handbook or a guide. They got a printed guide that had their information contained in there so it didn’t need to explain the various elements about copays and eligibilities. It was specific to what you’re approved for without necessarily having to paint the entire picture for you. It’s nice to see what I’m eligible for, but it would also be helpful to know what this costs me, eligible for, but also other resources I can explore. 

**M:** Great! Thanks for sharing all of that with me.  Let's get started. I'm going to share my screen.

--- 

## First Task: Create and Review Items - 10 minutes

*Begin screen sharing*

**M:** Can you see my screen?  Good. This is a tool called Mural. This is what we'll use to create a rough version of the personalized page you'd want to see when you log into VA.gov.  For our exercise today, let's imagine anything is possible. As we talk about what's important to you, think about anything and everything VA that would be helpful for you to see or have access to when you log in.  eBenefits, My healthE Vet - anything is fair game.  

**M:** You can see here that I've set up some blank sticky notes for us to get started, and I created some outlines to use as pages. One can represent the personalized page you see when you log in to VA.gov; I created the other in case there's another place on va.gov that makes more sense for any of the items.

**M:** First, we'll use the stickies to create items to put on the page.  Then, we'll organize them in the way that would be the most useful to you, if it were a real page.  

**M:** So, let's create some stickies for the items that are important for you to see when you log in. Again, just a reminder that we're talking about a personalized page that is specific to you, not a generic page for all Veterans.  It'll be helpful if you can also talk about why each item is important to you.
  
**M:** What would you want to see when you first log in to VA.gov?

**P:** I think the big one is to connect to my health benefits or medical record. So would this be, would it simply say My HealtheVet and link to that or specific as “Appointments, medications”

**M:** What would be most useful?

**P:** Medical appointments would be great! Medications, again I hardly don’t have any but I’m trying to think more globally.

**M:** Think about if that would be valuable to you, global to your life or things in the future excellent! Lets have a time that’s all about [P3]. 

**P:** So, things I’d want quick access to… medical appointments for sure, medications for sure, uhm… let’s see… 

**M:** You mentioned medical records

**P:** Yeah, records! I don’t look in there that often but it would be helpful to know your results. Test results, lab results. 

**M:** We have no limits here!

**P:** Cool. Uhm, another thing I use it for is communicating with my doctor. So, send a message to my doctor. Secure messaging is what it’s called. Communicating with doctor is perfect. Uhm… *pauses to think* I’m trying to think.. the only other thing I’d use the medical for… *pauses to think* I think that causes the medical side of things. 
I work in the VA so I know some veterans are persistent and active and are working on one case or another, I’m not in that state and hopefully won’t ever get there so I’m pretty good and established. But, it would be nice to find my documents. So, this could be… a single link to documents or disability documents.

**M:** What would be most helpful to you?

**P:** So, I’m thinking because it’s not something I’m super active in but if I clicked on a button that said “Find my documents” and I saw there were 30 options it might be nice to know what else I have access to. But that might be the best way to do it. A single link or source of all personalize documentation between me and the VA. One, because I don’t have a lot. But two, it would be crazy to have a single button just for one letter if that makes sense.

**M:** So what you’re saying is you wouldn’t want a button for every single letter, but a link that would take you to all the documents you have.

**P:** Correct! That would be cool. And then okay the other thing about disability is the payments. I get compensated every month but I don’t know why anyone would need to look at that in much detail. It’s as steady as it can be. It’s an ongoing thing so I don’t know. Viewing payment history might be nice for some. For me, personally, I wouldn’t look at it. 

**M:** Let’s leave it out! You mentioned in the intro about a copy of your disability letter for a job in the VA. Would you find that in the documents section?

**P:** Yes, I would look in there and ideally… so the eligibility packet would be visible in there, my DB214 (sp?), my disability letters, my letter from the VA to get my VA home loan, maybe that’s a stretch but a consolidated point where anything VA has sent me worth keeping. 

**M:** That’s not a stretch for this! The sky’s the limit here! Going back to some of these other ones, I want to make sure I understand why these are important. For medical appointments, what would you expect?

**P:** I’d like to see what my future appointments are, I’d like to be able to.. and we can schedule appointments and modify. 

**M:** Would you expect to do that right on the page or a link to somewhere more comprehensive?

**P:** Wow! Right on the page, look at you! I don’t know. Instead of thinking of a page of links, I’m thinking of a dashboard and I see my next five pending appointments in the top left corner, right. I don’t know.  *Moderator moves sticky note* That would be a live feed of your appointments, and maybe a button to request an appointment. Maybe that’s a separate tab, I don’t know. 

**M:** Let’s talk more about medications. What would you want to see?

**P:** Active list of medications. I go in there to refill it, that’s it. And most of these, because that’s a low level almost nothing process, it’s very simple. I just simply hit “Refill” and it’s not arduous or anything. Some people have 20 medications, not me! It might help them to see the active list and have a button to request a refill. Here’s your current list of appointments, request another appointment; current list of medications, request a refill.

**M:** Tell me about records.

**P:** I think there, it would be nice just to see the information from the last visit or if you need to pull a copy of medical records. In fact, one of the areas I work at is managing out patient registration. We have released information where folks can request a copy of their medical records. Unfortunately, it’s very paper-driven with hard copy forms and it’s not friendly. It would be nice to request a copy of medical records or a button to My HealtheVet to Blue Button to download a copy. This isn’t something I’d use all the time, but it’s still a terrible process. That’s straightforward. Maybe, that could be dashboard where it shows your last test or lab results. I mean, some of these things wouldn’t need to be a lifetime list of appointments and lab results, but what was the last. 

**M:** Okay, most recent!

**P:** Exactly! Within the last 3 months or something. With medical appointments, I said next 5. What’s coming, but I don’t need to see something schedule next year. 

**M:** Let’s say you have an annual appointment, would you want to see that if it wasn’t coming up?

**P:** Yes, if that was the only thing. It would be helpful to see that. I know some appointments are scheduled for several years out. I don’t know if it’s worth seeing that. Or if there’s an appointment count, next 5 appointments, see whatever’s next. 

**M:** Communicating with the doctor?

**P:** I just use the secure messaging feature through My HeatheVet. It’s very simple. I think the last time I sent them a message I asked if they had (note-taker missed what the participant said). Something simple. 

---

**M:** Okay, I'd like to show you some other stickies I made ahead of time that I thought might spark some interest for you. It's completely fine if none of these are things you'd care to see when you log in. Just let me know and we can set them aside.

**M:** Take a moment to review them, and think out loud as you do - I'd love to know how these resonate with you.  

  *Allow participant to review cards and encourage them to verbalize their thoughts as they do so.*

**P:** These are interesting! I like these. Some of these won’t connect to me, like GI Bill, but I could see some being beneficial. 

**M:** We’re focusing on what’s relevant to you. 

**P:** Right, let’s see if we can put anything else in parking lot. Let’s see… *participant reading silently* This is good. The share your VA medical records with your community care centers, is that something we’d request? I’d think if I was referred out, are you saying this is… maybe I’m going outside with my private health insurance not coordinated through the VA but I want to let the VA know?

**M:** Are either of those useful?

**P:** Neither are useful to me. But, I also… I mean where that’s important is the information exchange and the general sharing. Rather than sharing a document at a time, I’ve given the VA permission to share my information as needed. So maybe it would be, yea it’s useful. Leave it there. The information exchange is important and some people get caught up and confused by it so I think that’s good. 

**M:** Okay. 

**P:** Yeah, the demographic information is also very good. Contact information, Payments, I do like the community care. That’s not necessarily applicable but I see a lot of folks where community care is gonna continue to expand so some folks are getting 4-5 diff treatments and it would be nice to see it. 

**M:** For your personalized page, if you don’t use it, do you want to parking lot that?

**P:** Yeah, I’m not going out for anything. But maybe I’ll need it some day. Lets see…

**M:** You mentioned scheduling an appointment

**P:** Yup, get rid of that one. We got it. The 2 factor authentication, are we requiring that or is it… a personal preference?

**M:** This would be.. it’s already set up to a degree but I think it’s adding another later to set it up for your phone or email. 

**P:** I wouldn’t do it unless it made me do it. I understand why, but… Okay, so let’s see. *reading* Military service history is great to see. I know the VA doesn’t have that readily available. 

**M:** Would you find that with your documents?

**P:** You would find your DB214 with your documents, your discharge paperwork. I doubt you’d see the entire record, but it would be nice to see, and again it’s probably not needed every single day but a list of your awards and your military service record. List of awards, campaigns, the time you served, your DB214 has all that information. 

**M:** Okay! Well, good, it seems like we have -

**P:** All that stuff is great!

**M:** Alright, let me get these together and we can put stuff on the page. 

### Things to watch for:

-   How confident is the participant when listing the items they'd want to see?
-   How does participant respond to "why" each item is important?
-   What elaboration did the participant give (if any) on what information they expect to see in a particular item?
-   How did the pre-populated cards resonate with the participant?
-   Which items is the participant most confident they'd be interested in?
-   Do any items cause the participant to hesitate?
-   Any mention of notifications or updates?

---

## Second Task: Organize Items - 20 minutes

**M:** Great! Now, we'll move on to our pages. 

**M:** As I said earlier, one can represent the personalized page you see when you log in to VA.gov; I created the other in case there's another place on va.gov that makes more sense for any of the items. We can make more pages later, if we need them.

**M:** First, let's organize the stickies on your personalized page in the way that reflects how important they are to you. Tell me where to put each one, and we'll talk about why it would be helpful for you to have it there.  If there are stickies that are important to you, but you don't feel like the page is the right place, we can work with them later.

**P:** So is the vision here to have the personalized page, can I move these blocks or no?

**M:** Would you want to?

**P:** I don’t know, maybe, but maybe they move based on how often i click on them. if I were to build it, I’d put all the healthcare junk together, all the medical junk together. 

**M:** Let’s do it! So, test results, medications.. what else?

**P:** Communicate with my doctor. If I’d list: how you have there, communications next…

**M:** You said lab results fourth?

**P:** Yup. First one is medical appointments. So if you just slide all that over. And then, medical records is also part of that. I don’t know if it will fit five across.

**M:** It doesn’t matter, we can make the page bigger.

**P:** In my mind, those 5 live together. And then demographics, let’s not do demographics next. So then, *thinking* okay, your VA medical center needs to.. no never mind.

**M:** Why never mind?

**P:** Because it’s good to have that information, especially for snow birds that use more than one facility. but, to me that’s healthcare. But at the same time it’s demographics. I don’t know which world it lives better in. I don’t know if it’s in the top group or I leave it down there. 

**M:** Okay! We can move it towards the end. 

**P:** Some other things that need to move up is your order status/medical supplies 

**M:** You mentioned secure messaging. Would that be part of this?

**P:** It could. I don’t use it often, but if I were ordering hearing aids or supplies it would be nice to see the status of that. I don’t know, I think probably next thing is demographics. Disabilities is important but it’s stable and I don’t mess with it too much. So yeah, your contact information, dependents, personal information, direct deposit information, your VA medical center at the bottom, your military service history question mark? 

**M:** We can move it later if it doesn’t feel right.

**P:** I wonder if the documents you’ve uploaded belong there as well. Oh, change username + password for sure. Okay, let’s move those and see what it looks like. 

**M:** Would these be high up, middle? 

**P:** Middle of the page

**M:** Great! Making good progress. We have a few more on the side. 

**P:** Uh, so with that… can you put “Find my documents”… 

**M:** With the demographic information?

**P:** I’m thinking so. Share my medical record from top right should go with healthcare. Okay, so payments made to you, upload claim, notification, oh! Your notification preferences goes with demographics. And then all the remaining ones are a separate row for disability. 

**M:** Okay! Where would this priority fall for you?

**P:** For me personally it could be at the bottom. But for a lot of people it may be middle. 

**M:** This is [P3]’s page!

**P:** It’s nice to know, but almost always not something I’m going to access.

**M:** Would you still want to see all of this on a page, or would you want a link to another page?

**P:** Okay, the bottom row. The first two are similar, right?

**M:** They are! Do you see any difference?

**P:** It looks like the same thing. If I track my claim it would take me to that and show me. Either one of those, track or update would be the same. 

**M:** Let’s pick one. Do you care?

**P:** I don’t care which one. So there you can track what’s currently active and a status of your claim. *Reading the remaining ones out loud while thinking* I think if I was gonna reorganize that one I’d put ‘Your rated disabilities’ as the first block

**M:** Is that the right order for you?

**P:** Yup! 

**M:** Going back up to the top for this healthcare stuff

**P:** I work in this lane, so I’m fairly familiar with that. Yeah, go ahead. 

**M:** I was gonna ask if the priority and order feels right to you? Going left to right? 

**P:** You know what’s missing here? This is not something I’m overly involved in because I work at the facility but the Beneficiary Travel. So, certain veterans are eligible to receive reimbursement for going to medical appointments. This is a terrible paper-driven system, but they’re building a new fully online system. So maybe this could be a link to that platform. What is it called… I can get you that information if you want it. It’s being piloted some places but we’ll have it before the year’s out so every time they go to an appointment they can request travel and see the status. So that would be great to have here. 

**M:** Would that be associated with the appointments? With this block up here?

**P:** It could be, yes! You could only request reimbursement for appointments you’ve attended. So, that block is for future appointments. You can log on from home to check the status and request it. Currently, you submit a paper request and hope someone follows up on it. The one that’s coming should be pretty good. They’re projecting September or October. 

**M:** Cool! So, going back to this. Anything else missing or do you feel good about this?

**P:** Did we do something with.. hang on… oh we deleted the community providers yup. No, this is good! Where is medical center? 

**M:** We were torn between health and demographics. 

**P:** That’s good!

**M:** I wanna talk more about the demographics section. You’d want to see all this stuff on the dashboard?

**P:** well, maybe not. If it’s a true dashboard and it shows me all the current live information rather than a page of links, I think the current version is a page of links. But if this is gonna be a dashboard, one that would be amazing.. I don’t know how it’s possible… but it would be cool to see it! Some of the stuff would have to be links. 

**M:** Okay, I can create a button that says “Link to update account number”. So we could put that on a separate page. I can also do this… *Puts an arrow* do you feel like all of these would be links to do that stuff or would some of it still stay here on this dashboard page? Again, this is most useful for you. Forget what’s possible or the way things are currently built. 

**P:** Well, if I were going to upload documents to VA.gov it would be nice to see which ones. I don’t know if it would be live or linked. 

**M:** Any of these other things feel like they’d make more sense to you elsewhere?

**P:** So, when its says your dependents it would have my dependent’s information linked so I would know if I have someone extra in there or if I need to add someone. 

**M:** What information about your dependents would be most useful and what actions would you want to take?

**P:** The idea is to see that it’s up to date. Like, if you have a kid or get a divorce. Hopefully I’m not doing any of those. But at a glance I would know what needs to happen. It would be the same for address, phone number and all that jazz. It would visibly show your address. 

**M:** Alright, cool! Excellent, alright. How do you feel?

**P:** I like it! One of my beefs, I realize how complex it is and we have almost 0 integration on any of our information systems. But the veterans look at us as the VA, not the Healthcare side, Cemetery side, but to show this would be amazing. Working here, I don’t get a sense that there’s more than the healthcare side. 

**M:** Yeah, we want a landing pad where they have access to all the things they need and don’t have to source information from online. 

**P:** That would be great! 

---

## Third Task: Discuss existing screens - 5 minutes

**M:** I want to review some screens with you. This is the homepage. How does this line up with your expectations?

**P:** This is heads and shoulders above what we had a few years ago. This is merging different sections of the VA under one resource. It’s a page of links, it’s helpful, it’ll get you there. But sometimes it’s a link to a link to a link… 

**M:** That’s good you feel like it’s a step in the right direction! You made a comment before and you weren’t sure if it was a dashboard or a bunch of links. My sense is that you would prefer a dashboard and not a bunch of links?

**P:** Yes! For it to be truly personalized it would need to show the relevant information. Not, here’s a link to check appointments and I log into My HealtheVet. It’s all right there in the same source. The dashboard is pulling information from various resources but allowing me to go back to those resources to provide updates. 

**M:** Okay! The next thing I want to show you is an idea we have. This is just an idea, I’m curious for you to take a look at it and tell me how this lines up with what you’d expect or find useful. 

**P:** This is pretty much what we’re talking about! This is amazing! Very cool! We just talked about exactly these things. Messages from your team, can tell they aren’t read yet. You’re not listing five years of appointments, but the next one. Prescriptions tells you it’s tracking. That’s only something recently we’ve started where we send email confirmation about these. Definitely helpful for medications that are mailed from consolidated pharmacy. Refill in progress.. .pretty good. Oh, cool! Far right, that’s neat!

**M:** Tell me about that

**P:** A lot of people look to connect with the organization itself and other people. With COVID-19 we have rules about who can come in, and people use the VA as a social platform so keeping people connected with events is good. Compensation payment, cool… Date you submitted it… cool… this is really good!

**M:** Up here you commented these hadn’t been read. What signifies that?

**P:** The blue dot and the fact that they’re in bold. I may have made it up, but my first impression is that. And the bright red! 

**M:** This is something else I wanted to ask you about. A lot of sites show alerts or notifications as a status update. Going back to the page you created, where would you expect to find that stuff? 

**P:** I like your page better! I would expect anything related to money I owe or money owed to me to be maybe in the same lane, possibly, with… *sighs* I - I don’t know because this is a copay for a medical appointment or medication I received, and I don’t pay the VA for anything else but I do make those payments. Maybe that stays in healthcare because it’s only associated with that. 

**M:** Okay, and it would be an update or some kind of alert. 

**P:** The way you had it laid out on the demo page was perfect. 

**M:** Our session was really focused on this personalized page. How do you see this being different from a profile?

**P:** A profile, I would assume,… maybe… I would assume a profile is simply a list of information where a dashboard is relevant and current information. So if you go back to the page you made. The consolidated doctors trying to reach me messages, they want me to make my payments, my activity, my refills are in progress, I don’t know that my profile would show that. One thing I like is on the right side where these benefits are things I’m not necessarily using so they wouldn’t need to show every time but they’re nice to have. So, if I’m looking at that $25 bill and wondering how to pay it I would say we should add information about how to help if people are struggling. So, on the left hand side you have the individual tabs. Are those active? 

**M:** No! But what would you expect to see?

**P:** Further information about those particular things. This is great! This is really cool! I see this answering a lot of questions that we currently have to answer. We point people to different resources and it’s not always helpful. I told my friend to sign up for VA.gov but from there you have to follow a trail. 

**M:** Yeah! We want to make something that follows a trail. Is there anything else you would want to see?

**P:** No, not that I can think of. Can I send you a message? 

**M:** Absolutely! You can reach out to the team you talked to when you set up your session. 

**P:** When can we see this?

**M:** I think it will be rolled out in a phased approach that’s incremental. 

**P:** Three year’s time?

**M:** I think you could expect changes and improvements by the end of this year. Don’t quote me on that! 

**P:** I won’t write an article about it. 

**M:** Thank you!

**P:** This is very exciting. Some of my frustrations are resolved if your webpage comes to fruition.
