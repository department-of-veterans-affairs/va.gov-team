## Intro - 3 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Liz Lantz and I have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Our team is working on re-designing the page you see when you log in to VA.gov so that it's  personalized to your needs. Today, I'd like to talk about your experience when you log in to the site, and then we'll go through an activity that will help us understand what would make a personalized page most useful to you.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45-60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve the logged-in experience to better meet Veteran's needs. I won't be offended by any opinions you express, and I wholeheartedly welcome your feedback.

- **You and I will go through a collaborative activity to help our team understand how we can design a personalized page that best meets your needs.** We'll use a virtual board to create a rough version of a page that would best meet your needs and expectations - I want to emphasize this is not a generic page for all Veterans.  I'll drive the mouse so you focus on our conversation. Again, please note we're not testing you in any way, and there are no right or wrong answers.

  If time allows, I have card sort set up that we can jump over to after the virtual board.

- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**

- **Do you have any questions so far?**

- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

  - If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

  - *Start recording.*

  - I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

**P**: Yes. Fine. I have no problem.

Before e get started into screensharing, I'd like to ask you a few questions Do you remmber the last time you visited va.gov?

It was probably a week ago.

What were youdoing?

I was looking tos ee if I could find out what was going on with my current clain that was remanded from the board to the PO to the regional office here in columbia

Do you remember if you logged in?

Yes

Was it a typical experience?

It was a typcial one. I seemed to have managed to navigate the screens on va.gov as far as loggin on is concerned. I don't have very many problems logging into the va.gov place at all.

That's good. Can you tell me about some other times tha tyou ve gone to the site?

Uh. Doing... I think the .gov takes me into ebenefits... I use that quite a bit for talking to my doctors ont hec onfidential message system. My medications. Apartments. General questions that I can ask. I do my psychiatrist, we do it by phone. But it's kind of based around the same thing. So jut about all of my things are run through va.gov into I guess the access points to ebenefits. Which encompasses a lot of that.

That makes sense. When you visi the site how often do you sign in?

If I'm tracking something, 2-3 times a week. Sometimes 4. I havec done it about 4 times a week if I was really concentrating on reading something the might ahve put out some sort of policy that might effect me, something I might talk to the doctors about. 

Sounds like youre a really regular user.

Yes.

One more questoin. Can you tell me about the benefits taht youc urrently recive?

Right now, I have 70% rating. I waiting like I said, some other things like cmp exams. I'm waiting for them to barrage the hell all that back. So i haven't seen anything like that yet.

What does cmp stand for?

Compensation and pension exams. They do a medical, mental what have ou.

Okay, any other benefits that you're getting?

I'm now allowed, I can go on some of the latest ones that I can go on the military bases now and use the PX and the commisary. And also a number of different like uh, movie places and other places you can do on base. I can do those now. Taht just started here about last year sometime. 

Nice. I imagine with the coronavirus they aren't doing a lot of things like that, it'll be nice when they open back up.

Absolutely. There's a lot of other... if I want to buy a house, they're making it easir for us to buy a house or refinance. look at how to change a mortgage. Some of that has been updated. Let's see what else.  There are a number of different things that help us get discounts like in Home Depot and some other places.

Okay, cool. That's a great list ot help us get started. I'm going to share my screen.  This is a tool called Mural...Let's imagine anything is possible. The point of this for you to log in to VA.gov and you can see all the things that matter to you.

## STICKIES.

Think about the things that are important to you when you log in. What comes to mind?

Um. A guide for one thing. If I went to look into something there, it would give me a personalized guide of what I'm trying to look for where I'm going. Yeah, like if I wanted to sign on and I wanted to talk to my doctor about an issue, or I wanted to talk about my medicine. Or my cmp. Most of the time I'm going to be doing 1-2 of those things. Especially wellness issues.

WE could even think of this page as your guide.

Okay.

You said the cmp travel is an exam you have to take, can you elaborate on that?

The travel would say I have an upcoming exam on the R side of my body on my knee and my legs. That's what I would be looking for. Here's the appt date and here's what I'm going tos ee. It oculd be a contract or it could be at one of the clinics. 

Okay, I started an ew one here. It says appt information. 

What time, what date, who I'm going to be actually seeing.  That's the most important things - your appts and where you're wanting to go.

Would you want to be able to do anything with it? Or do you just want to see it?

So say something came up and I wanted to make an appt that was scheduled. Say on emy knee... I'd be able to look at that and I could call the number the give me and reschedule my appt. 

So like scheduling.

Yes.

So if you had the ability to do all of this online instead of calling, would that be useful to you?

Absolutely!

What else comes to mind?

Probably communication with my primary and my mental... the people who handle my mental issues. 

Okay.

Right. That's a very high one up there. In case like I said, he may want to be calling me for something that I don't know about.  So that's important.

And medications. What about that would you want tos ee?

Um. Some of the medications drop off. Of the medication page. And I have to sometimes send a message saying what happened to this medication and when can I get it? Which usually isn't bad because I recieve my medicaiton from the mail from Charleston. 

Alright. The my healthevet wellness issues... can you tell me more about that?

I'm just starting to pay attention to the wellness issues. I shold'v estarted a long time ago. My pain issues. Trying to... any type of breathing issues. Um. My joints. And my shoulder and my arm. and stuff. All those different issues, even down to that I want to go to tai chi or yoga.

Tehre's tons of yoga calsses on zoom now. You should try that.

I will. 

I see that kind of as preventative or self care? Am I udnerstanding that right?

Yeah... preventative but a lot of it has to do with chronic pain. And mindfulness training which I'm doing as well.

Is this just info that you're looking for? Or actions.

Actions. I'd really want that. OH and don't forget diet. I'm learning to forget the salt and the hot sauce haha.

Are there any other things that come to mind?

Oh my goodnes, I'm starting to have a bad brain loss here. There are a lot of things... you mean as far as what I would like to see done or what have ya?

Let's do this.  I ahve some cards here that might be of interest to you.

Oh Great!

I'd love to know how these resonate with you.  If they aren't important we can get these out of the way. We've already talked about a list of medications, talking to your doctor, scheduling appts... but all of these other thigns. Would any of this be useful to you when yo ulog in?

Absolutely! I've got to make sure the DD and bank account information is correc.t I need to make sure it hasn't dropped out - that would effect my payments. Um. Download my medical records. That is also very important. I don't have... my payments made to the VA is pretty fluid. I never go in to watch those. So that's fine. 

You said somethinga bout the address...?

My payments go to the bank.

So you wouldn't care about this?

It's not high priority beacuse they already have that information.

You can also put this one about your personal info, that can go down in there too. That's part of the contact info.  Track your disability claim or status is also important. 

There's another one in here that'ssimilar. Track your disability claim or status or Update your disability claim or status.

Participant: They can go together because that's about the same thing.  They actually will, when I track and go into the updates to look anyway, I can't make updates to it, but the VA can.

M: Do you think we need both of them?

No, I don't. I like `udpates on your claim or appeal status` better. Because tracking just looking to see where they are. But if you're looking for the update, of something that may have chagned for your appeal, you might have to send them more information, the doctor might have to do something else. That's more in depth, and better.

Cool. That makes sense.

Also. Your VA letters and docs... One of them is a letter that you can use to make sure you can get on base. That tells you your rating. That's important.

We're making good progress here.

Okay. Military service history. Not important anymore... Only that Iw as discharged on honorable conditions. taht's fine. I'm good with that one. That's not important. Your rated disabilites... combined and individual... I guess yo ucould put that up there as a separate issue. Because I do go in there as one of the thigns I look for when I log in currently.... Let's see.... my depenedents is already in there.

That's alaready in VA.gov?

That's part of the letters and stuff that you need to put in the system to recieve pay and that sort. So that's already in there. This one everyone has a qeustion about... Share your va medical records with your community center. That one has become very important later. Remember when I was telling you about if I'd have to charleston to get a ct scan... I'd need that to be authorized.

if this was on your page, would this be most useful to you if it was actually sending records to these centers? Or is it more useful for the VA to get permission from you.

I don't do anything. The VA contacts the contractors. Take PTSD, I saw a specialist - she has access to my medical records. Whe nI went to her and she examined me, which means I either got a claim in they increased them or decreased it. I don't do much int hat except for go to the appt, the authorization and who to bill is through the VA. I don't do any of that.

If you saw this on the site, it'd just be you telling the VA it's okay to be doing this.

yes. It just makes sure the dr has a copy of what they are supposed to be looking it. And they can say, yep I have the letter already and the files pulled up. Let's see.  I haven't done a lot of uploading. It gets a little weird, I haven't tried it.

Can you tell me more?

Um. Not the info itself, but trying to get your computer or printer... I don't have a big fancy printer... Trying to load something directly from my cmoputer systerm.  They may have requested something from me.  I have been having some issues trying to figure it out.  I usually fax it to them or do the priority mail.

Wjhat I understand is that your computer system is difficult, not the website.

Exaclty.  Most the time it's sensitive medical documents

If that's the case I'm giong to move this one down here.

Okay lets see what else. Uh. Okay. The order status for medical supplies... that would go up there. Because I do have hearing aids. I forgot to tell you that. GI bill benefits- I don't qualify anymore. It went way past the date. It expired on me and we can get any of those back. That should go down below, I don't pay attention to it anymore... Okay. Um. I haven't set up 2 factor authentication. I know I can go change my password from time to time. This is something tis new to me... so I"m not sure how deep va is getting into that. 

is it somethign that would be imporatnt to you?

It would match up with user name and password. They woudl go hand in hand.

I know what my va medical center is, I don't relaly need that. I know I go to savannah, so. Ummm. Community care location. I don't think they've given us those. That was what I was telling you... if they're ogint to send me to someone out of town or what have you.  I don't have nay control over that, all I know is when I get the letter or phone call is when I find out... So that's not in my purview. 

Last one - notification preferences.

That's in my address, my home phone, cell hpone email address, text and they can do that. That's already been taken care of.

Well, we have a really good group here. I'm uust going to make this a little more neat. Is anything missing for you? Have we covered everything?

I think I have.  I'll think about if there's something out. I think that's about 98% of everything. 

Let's start putting them on your page. You said yoour most important is your medication and your appts?

yes.

i didn't clarify this - but we're going to make this in order of priority to you.  Top row is most important, and on...

Talk to my dr about issues wouldbe at the top of the page. Second is rated disabilities.  Share VA medical records should be in the first.  Let's see. Yeah, that would definitely be up at the top.  Download your medical records would be secondary from the top. 

I'm interested to know why this would be more of a priority?

Because that's basically... I can personally go in and download my medical information... whether its high blood pressure, cholesterol, anything they've done where they give x-rays. I can pull them up. But the VA has overall authority. Say they wanted to send some records to a contract, they would do that. VA allows me tos ee all of that so I know what I'm talking about.  Updates on my claims and PO status... that should be at the top.  Medical supplies that should be secondary.

So we have one about medications. And this for medical supplies.  

That should go in the same place. No, I take that back. Hearing aids and glasses is different than medications. That should proably go right up under there.

And what about this travel from my cmp... and that led to the appt one.

Well. Actually. Any time I leave from here to go to a regular check up. It's travel pay.  We get paid for cmp and regular as well.  

So the information you want to see reflected is the money you're getting paid?

Not too much the money, but the input after we finished the exam.  We have to put in after we've gone there. It's something that I don't worry about too much.

So, you're thinking it's like a confirmation that you successfully...

Yes.  i was trying to think of that word. Thank you for saying confirmation.

You're welcome! So this would go in the same area as the other stuff we were talking about?

Waht about the 2 factor identification. Where would you put that?

I think that would ahve to come at the beginning of everyting because that's how I get online. I get on with a password and authenntication.  That might come ahead of everything esle.

So would it be on a different page?

yes, that should be on the front page.

Okay so we have DD and bank information left. I don't worry about that as much. I don't really go into it. Unless it has changed or something. But it's not something that when I go into it I will always check it. So unless something is changed.

So for the DD and bank information. If you were going to check it. Would you expect to be able to make updates to it right on the page? Or would it be a link that would take you to somewhere else?

The only thing I could change on it is my bank information and my address. That would be the only thing that I'd be able to change... Everything else I think the VA has control over.

Downloading your VA letters and documents, where would you prioritize that?

On that second row. I would probably not be concerned with it unless I knew something had changed. What have you... medically system wise, something the doctors... that'd be the only time I'd be concerned.  But I do go in and look them up and print them out from time to time.  SS will print a letter saying this is how much you get etc... that's the type of information that's in there. Healthevet.

Where would youw ant to see that?

AT the top. That's more imporant to me as it goes a long. I"m payimg more attention to that.

How do you feel? Does this reflect somethigng that would be useful to you?

ABsolutely. I think that would be 100%. I wouldnt' ahve to do so much thinking on my part if I had something like thist done where I can go in and I can see it. Is it possible that all of these would have links to the actual sites? Like if I clicked on the one we just did it could take me to the HealtheVet?

The sky is the limit. What would work fo ryou?

Yeah, links. The medical supplies... That one is not going to my primary doctor, it's going to a specialist... where you would get our prosthetic legs and hearing aids.  The primary dr has authority to call and say I need the support for my lower back.  They would then call him and he would say yues. And he would give me a backbrace or what have you.

So a link would be the most useful thing to me?

Uh, medication, appts, po claims, po status. Those would be.... ift ey had a link to those directly instead of having to go to this to get to that. And when you're on ebenefits you have to go into here to go there, to ask for a prescription. It's not where you think it would be. It's on it's own little link in the system.  I don't know how that could be managed.  If medications could be linked straight into the medications section in ebenefits. If it could, thatwoudl be nice.

We're trying 

A lot of veterans.,.. if this was like that. They'd sign in log-in, they'd say I want to check when my appt is for the month of may or june. They could click on that appt information sticky and itw ould go straight to thea rea where nothing but the appts are. Instead of going in this and that and sometimes it doesn work and you have to go out and go back in.

I hope that's what this would represent to you, like a place wyou could go instead of going through a bunch of links.

I know my pain management class. some aare computer savvy and some are not, and to try to get someone who is not computer savvy like my brother in law. He doesn't know how to navigate the system.  I think that woudl be great and say 'oh my goodness, all I have to do is hit htis appt sticky - I have appt next week!' You don't have to call a dr and write it down. Maybe you could have a print feature form?

Would that be useful?

Yes, Absotluetly. I print out basically everything that I go in the VA. If I'm looking for something, I always print out just about everything that I see so that if I can go it can readily be put in by whoever.  And I can say this is what I printed out and we can discuss it. 

Yeah, that would be helpful to a lot of people. I know we're nearing the end of our session. I have a few more questions. A lot of sites have a way to give updates or notifications. I know you said updates on your claim or appeal status was better... if you were looking at this page. Where would you expect to see that an action is needed?

On that one right there. When I go into the claims and appeals area... They are separated but not separated. The claims might refer you back to the appeals. The appeals makes you go through a whole nother logged in, you have to re-log in again. Otherwise you can't see anything.

Okay.  So. Going back to the notification part. Say you had a notification that a dr sent you a message, where would you expect to see that?

There is a section in ebenefitis where you can talk to your dr via email message system and he can talk to you, back and forth. It's protected.  

Alright that makes sense. Just wanted to double check the questions. Um. Okay. We have ac ouple minutes left - I just want to get your reaction to the current homepage. How does this line upw ith your expectations.

Oh. Wow. I like this. 

have you seen this page before?

No. The ebenefits system that you do it, it's not broken down like this. See healthcare... refill and track your prescriptions... so does appts come under healthcare. If it was just a simple page like this how they got it. And all they have to do is click on it to go into another section.  The healtcare is separeate from the claims...Yeah healthcare, disability, records, education... There may be another one. couple at most. But they actually have a space where you can put your own personal health information. I haven't done it. A lot of it is you to be on one screen and link to another screen and that's where it'll be.  I'll have to go back to that to get to my healtcare screen.

Okay. Um. This is another alternative to what a logged-in homepage could look like.

Oh, that's even nicer. (reading) Oh, I like this even better thant he other screen. IThis one is more detailed. OOh I really like this one. I take this one over the other one. 

Okay ha that's good to know.

Do you have any questions? or thoughts?

yeah. Not so much as questions. but. Uuh. How does what I did... line up with what other veterans have come up with?

There's a consistent pattern.  What we've seen from these are healthcare and medical are the most important. It varies int erms of benefits as their second priority. but this is definitely the mimportant thing and we're seeing a trend in what people are using va.gov to access.

I'm glad to see it. It can be confusing if you've never used va.gov or any of the systems within that. Just the VA stuff itself can be confusing if you don't knoe how to navigate the links. Especially if you're not computer literate. It's hard to get ont he phone and call your dr, the phone isn't secure enough.  All veterans should have a way to figure out a way to get into health and claims... so they can look and see for themselves. I can tell you, trying to call a dr to get his attention is a hard thing to do.

It's people like yout hat help with this. thanks ro your feedabck we can make things easier for them.

That's one of the best things I've heard so far. I really appreciate it. Like one time I said, once I said. I didn't want to wait for someone to help me figure out where this or that is. I wanted tos ee where it was myself. I done 95% of all my claims, medical, appeals myself. They have copies, but nobody has ever reached out to me. I haven't done too bad, I thank God that i'm smart enough to figure it out.

Well, it's been a real pleasure talking to you. I appreciate your time.

I appreciate it too, and appreciate what you're trying to do. If my big mouth can help in some way, that'd be good for me. God bless and take care.

Bye.
