## Notes
**Note:** Notes begin after the Moderator began recording the screen/audio. 

  - *Start recording.*

**M:** Do you remember the last time you visited VA.gov. What were you doing?
**P:** Yeah it wasn't that long ago. I was trying to find out if there was any other breaks for Veterans for purchasing a home or things to go along with it, as far as tax exemptions and stuff go. I frequent VA.gov quite often.

**M:** Do you remember if you logged in?
**P:** I think I was already on eBenefits and it kind of just took me into it. Or I used the same login, I don't remember logging in, it was just a generic website search.

**M:** Can you tell me about other times you go on?
Education stuff, I was briefly married so I wanted to see about benefits for my spouse. I click through links for other stuff, it's a plethora of information. I'm disabled too, medical stuff, pretty much anything.

**M:** When you visit the site, how often do you log in?
**P:** Um... for VA.gov, I don't remember logging in. I just do a general Google search.

**M:** You mentioned eBenefits, do you log in to that site?
**P:** Oh yeah, that's got a lot of information on there, so I log in. If you log into one [ebenefits, myhealthevet], you can use the same password for the other ones as well. 

**M:** What did you go to do at eben or mhv last time?
**P:** MyHealtheVet - I was requesting a prescription refill. Prior to that, I was looking for my dd2414 for my home purchase.

**M:** And last but not least, can you tell me about the benefits you currently receive?
**P:** Medical benefits - I'm fully disabled so I get medical benefits and compensation for myself and my spouse. I got approved for school, vocational benefit. My husband got approved for school, so that's Chapter 35. We're getting that through the VA. My home is also purchased through a VA loan.

### Warm-up Questions
_Shares screen and explains the exercise_

**M:** What comes to mind - when you log in, what do you want to access to first?
**P:** A basic page would have like a profile so I can make sure my information is updated like address. Links to open up... portals that I use frequently - MHV, eBenefits, anything having to do with Veteran disability stuff. Anything that can relate to us. Spouse information.

**M:** What info about your spouse?
**P:** Benefits available to him - jobs, education...

**M:** If there was a link on this page to MyHealtheVet, what would you want to pull onto this page?
**P:** I mean... Myhealthevet lets me communicate with my provider - and you can do all kinds of things through there like requesting prescriptions, cancelling appointments, setting appointments. For eBenefits, I'd like to see any upcoming changes to the pay that they have. Like they usually have proposals for any increases that they do to our paychecks yearly or monthly. And then the documents are the most importance - being able to access statements, dd214, letters. 

**M:** Why is it important?
**P:** Just getting to them in a secure way. I needed them when purchasing my house, so it's convenient. As well as being able to upload anything... a personal thumbdrive where you can have all of your documents.

**M:** Anything else come to mind?
**P:** That's the most important things that are on there. Anything having to do with your pay, yknow... those education links to do with the spouse and us specifically, the veterans. It would have been nice to have a message telling us 'hey this is new to chapter 31' so I wouldn't have had to go through with that process.

**M:** Anything else that can pop up that would be important to you?
**P:** Any changes to the site. You can go through your ebenefits to get to this thing... anything about changes, yknow.

### Task 1:

I think direct deposit would be hand in hand with personal information because you don't change it that often. I am planning to switch banks so I'd go in and do that.

Also - dependents, I think that should be under my profile. You know, you say you're married and it would drop down and ask you who your spouse is.  It would tell you information, which would've been helpful for me. That there is all this information you need to send off to make sure that they had in order for him to be added on.  I'm fully disabled so it's different for me than a regular Veteran. It would say in there your spouse is eligible for this plethora of benefits, click here to go to the stuff that that person needs. That would've been very helpful for me.

Disability would be under my personal information. Like my main thing usually on ebenefits, under your personal information your personal disability rating or award ... it would say 100% or 20% or 30% or whatever. And there are different things that go along with each of those. For me it's completely different.

**M:** Is that different from spouse information?
Yeah, because once you put I'm married, this is my spouse, here's their name and stuff, that would be something that popped up because I entered their information it wouldn't just automatically be there. It would just kind of pop up and say 'due to your new marriage', and it knows that I'm 100%, okay you're 100%, your spouse is eligible for medical benefits and education benefits. It wouldn't be there for everyone, it pops up because it knows that he's eligible because of my rating.

Change your password... I think those would be under profile, those are your basic components of your profile.

2FA would also be a part of that.

Let's see, *participant reading stickies aloud*, those are all good ones.  That one, `Share your VA medical records..` is a good one for me, I just had a medical procedure done and there was a big back and forth on "is the doctor supposed to request these records?", "am I supposed to bring them?", it was this big thing, and they were like, they can send them or you can request them through this form but then you have to wait, it was a hassel. There was a big lack of communication and something like that would be very helpful to do that.


[RECORDING CHECK]

For me, [Track disability claim] isn't important, because I'm permanently 100% rated, so I don't check it.

**M:** We can probably get rid of updates on your claim, then...
No, because they can deny me other benefits. I still need to update that and be able to appeal when I need to.

Now, VA medical center, what does that mean? Is that my specific hospital I attend?

**M:** Would that be useful to you?
Yeah that would be to have a direct link to that hospital... I've worked with a few VAs and they're different in different aspects. Knowing what classes and stuff they offer would be a great help.

**M:** We talked about prescriptions... these are different?
Yeah, because there's a list and it has a box where you can request refills or new ones added. 

I like the community care locations, I don't know what type of community care... is it all community or is it pertaining to Veterans...

**M:** That refers to locations you can get care and use your benefits. Other people can go to these places too.

Yeah thats good, it's always good to have community links like shelter... or items.

**M:** So you understand this to be broader than just healthcare?
Oh, yeah.

For me, medical community or health community... I'd assume it was broader than that.

Order medical supplies often goes with prescription... they consider medical socks the same as with prescription...

Notification preference would also be under profile.

**M:** Why would medical service history be good to have access to?

I know when filling out resumes, it can be hard to fill out when your career blends together. It's hard to remember, so this would be very helpful. For background checks, you have to go back 10 years, so it can get extensive and tedious. 

Payments made to you by the VA... I think we talked about that, when we talked about changes to the payment. That would go with that one.

Download my medical records... I don't think that would would be necessary. There's no need for hard copy.

Your GI Bill benefits balance - that's actually a really good one - that would have been very helpful. If I would've known, I would have gotten $1200 a month instead of $600 a month if I took an extra class. 

**M:** Would the balance alone be enough?

No, it would've been nice just knowing I have benefits left. I would've been able to give that information to the SCO.

**M:** I'd like to propose one - 'Benefits balance and what you can do with it'

Yeah once you see your balance, you can see other benefits you have available to you. 

**M:** The first thing you said was profile information - is there anything that's not in this group that would belong in that category?

Basic address, phone number, basic information... you've got yourself, your spouse, your dependents. Bank information. Um... that's pretty much encompasses the personal information. Maybe even your... specific VA. Because that's your personal VA, that would be good.

**M:** Would you want this to be on the page right when you log in?

Yes, that would be good.

**M:** Ok, would you expect this personal information at the top of the page?

Yeah, just kind of like a dashboard... 

**M:** What else would you want to see? Do you think of it like a dashboard?

Yeah, I do. Everything I do kind of does that - like school. It shows your personal information showing, like huge tabs. Half of the screen is showing like you have... then you have other tabs with information, medical... then this other page would open up and they'd have something to do with community resources...

**M:** Tabs - side by side or stacked?

It doesn't matter as long as it's clear to see that they're tabs. But I would still want to have all of those other tabs up - like they can follow you to the next page. 

**M:** Like a navigation?

Right.
 
**M:** What would you want to see on your first page on medical stuff?

Um... the medical would be the communication with the doctor, send a message to your provider. Show you a list of your current prescriptions that you have and then you can request... order supplies and stuff in that area. 

**M:** And appointments?

Yes that would be under there as well.

**M:** Anything else?

No.

**M:** What about VA medical records?

Oh yeah, sure.

**M:** Is any of this stuff something you'd want to see on the dashboard right when you log in?

Um... no, I wouldn't expect it right offhand, I would think it would be a different tab like we did up top here.

**M:** So these sticky notes would be links to take you to do those things?

Yes. As long as there's enough information on the tab that you don't have to click in it to see what it is. I'd rather see another tab with more information than not knowing precisely what we're looking at.

**M:** So precise naming is important to you?

Yes.

**M:** Prescriptions would be its own category?

Yeah.

[39-42 minutes in, I didn't follow anything...]

Um... yeah, the military service um... that would be with all of the other documents.
So I think that the messages... and the message pop ups... as well as any community locations I would think um... all of those really, because uh... it's information. Y'know it's messages, information... it would just be under... 

**M:** It would be 'Information' - is that a good label?

Maybe 'Messages and information' - kind of like 'what's new?' It draws the eye.

**M:** Where would you see this on the page?

That would probably be under that one... so I would probably move that one under the education tab, and then the other one would just be messages and information... it would be 'what's new' it could be pertaining to anything.

**M:** If this was on the dashboard on the main dashboard page...

Yeah, that would be highlighted so it catches your eye. I've seen one where it's flashy a little bit, like ALERT ALERT.

**M:** Do you think it would be better placed... 

It wouldn't... I think we're drawn to the left, so the top right corner would be fine.

I think other sites have the tabs stacked.

**M:** One thing we didn't really elaborate on... anything with disability. Can you elaborate on what would be helpful?

Anything that pertains to disability benefits based off of rating. If you're fully rated, you can get free education pass. It's only because you have a disability, you know, if you need help with your disability like PTSD, mental health... but to me, that would fall under medical.

**M:** So the GI Bill benefits balance... is that a number you'd want to see on your dashbaord?

Nah, I would expect to find it under the education tab. Even on the dashboard to say if ... GI Benefits and to have a basic number and then under the education tab, it would be more in depth. I've used this much at this school, this many credits, a breakdown of how it was dispersed. You can track which schools you went to and what they were paid. That would help me get an idea of how much money is going to each school so I can know what is realistic to me to go to another school.

**M:** It seems to me that the most priority is easy access to everything and not so much on one page.

Yeah I get distracted easy... so having the tabs sorting you into categories, I know it's gonna tell me education stuff.

**M:** Of the benefits that you're recieving, are there ones that are more important to have infomration about?

Of course my pay, but medical information is very important.


**M:** Have you seen the logged in page?

Yeah, uh huh. I just get to it from another link. I don't remember going there directly to log in. I get there through ebenefits or myhealthevet.

**M:** Can you tell me how this page lines up with your expectations?

Yeah, that's very... that's great, it has the name on there, so you know you're logged in. It has all of the different topics there. I like the disability one with all the stuff we talked about. 

TASK 5:
**M:** How does this line up with your expectations?
I really like... right away, my eye is drawn to if I owe anything. So there's no confusion if you change your address. That would give you an alert that would prompt you to check your profile and update it. 

I love the side here, the rating -- it shows what you're eligible for.

**M:** Would you want to see something like that also for your spouse?

I think it would be hand in hand with our benefits... if it said 100% instead of 40%, it would say education underneath.

I like that... it's very clear. 

I really like that one - claims and appeals, I like the yellow say ing you still need stuff. Because sometimes you don't get updated quickly about missing stuff.

**M:** And you understand the alert. to be an alert?

Oh yeah, anything with a different color. Any color red or something will be looked at.

I like the events nearby, because that would be specific to your VA.

**M:** Is this what you were talking about with tabs?

Yeah... when you click on them, it would open details for those things.

I like the overview because you can see everything without going into the details.

**M:** Any extra thoughts or questions?

How long before this is rolled out?
