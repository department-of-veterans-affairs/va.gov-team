**Note**: We ended the session early because the participant's computer wasn't working and they had no feedback about the current homepage.

## Warmup questions

**Do you remember the last time you visited VA.gov. What were you doing?**

It’s been a couple… maybe about 5-6 weeks ago.

I was paying for some medicing eht VA had sent me.

**Do you remember if you logged in?**

Um, (Didn’t get participant response)

**Can you explain whether or not that was a typical experience for you?**

No, it wasn’t. It was pretty routine. I do it all the time. I have a prescription I take and everytime the VA sends them, I have to go on and pay my portion of the prescription drugs.

**Tell me about some other times you've gone to the site.**

That’s basically all I use the site for. Ocassionally I click on something that might seem of interest to me. The Coronavirus alert (Didn’t get participant response)

**When you visit the site, how often do you sign in?**

About once every six weeks or so

**And last but not least, can you tell me about the benefits you currently receive?**

I use the VA for about 90% of my medical. Of course, I am retired, so I draw retirement from the VA also. I have a 10% disability, so I draw 10% disability from the VA.

**Can you elaborate on “medical”**

Anything that has to do with anything medical that I do. I go for every 6 months. I was going until the Corona thing popped up. Then, if there was anything I needed over and above that. Recently, they sent me to (redacted) to do some test, so I went to (redacted) to do those tests and then followed up with my medical provider.

I don’t go as often as others because I live out in the country, 1 hr 15 minutes from the VA. The nearest VA is in (redacted).

## First section: Create and Review Items 

**What would be the most helpful thing for you to see on the page?**

Just a list of what was available, which I think is already there. Just a list of what is on the particular site. If you need medical or need to check on retirement or anything the VA provides, if that was on the first screen, that would be very beneficial.

**That’s broad. What’s most relevant to you? (Liz repeats some of what the participant had mentioned earlier)**

No ma’am, not if it’s not already there. I haven’t gotten too much to complain about. I’m not the most computer literate person in the world, but I don’t have too much problems with the way the site is now. I can find what I’m looking for pretty easy.

As far as what I would recommend to improve it, I don’t really have any recommendations.

**Without being able to share my screen and if you don’t have any recommendations, I think we should wrap the session**
