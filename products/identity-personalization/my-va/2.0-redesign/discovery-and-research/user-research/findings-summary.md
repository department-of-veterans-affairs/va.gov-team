Research Goals
--------------

This study was conducted as part of a large discovery effort to kick-off the redesign of the logged-in homepage for VA.gov. Through[  research we did in July 2019](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/personalization%202.0/discovery-research/dashboard-interviews/research-summary.md), we determined that it's time to revisit both My VA and the logged in homepage.[  We have proposed consolidating these two pages into one](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/personalization%202.0/discovery-research/README.md#key-takeaway-we-need-to-revisit-our-my-va-logged-in-homepage-approach) by getting rid of My VA altogether and treating the logged-in homepage as a user's personalized landing pad and router.

We conducted this study to talk with Veterans to better understand their needs and what would make the logged-in experience more useful to them inform the next phase of our design work.

Research Methodology
--------------------

We began each session with an initial short qualitative interview to gain insight into the "why" questions we have.

The interviews were followed by a moderated co-design exercise. We used Mural to help the Veteran "create" their own personalized homepage by sharing our screen and conducting an interview in which we built a personalized homepage with their input. We first created "sticky notes" (referred to as "items" in this document) reflecting what the participant would most want to see upon logging in. Then, we reviewed pre-populated items our team created that the participant may want to add to their page. Once the participant felt the items covered their needs, we organized them by priority on a page template.

The interviewer (Liz Lantz) managed all of the interactions in Mural so Veterans could focus on the conversation. 

Given that we have not previously run a co-design exercise, we had a card sort ready as a back-up method, but did not need to use it in any session. 

### Who we talked to

We spoke to 10 Veterans:

-   6 women, 4 men

-   5 participants age 35-44, 2 participants age 45-54, 2 participants age 65-74, and 1 did not disclose their age

-   6 Caucasian, 2 African-American, 1 Hispanic, and 1 American Indian or Alaska Native

-   3 participants identified as having cognitive and/or functional disabilities

-   5 participants had completed high school or some college; 5 participants had an Associate's degree or higher

-   All had at least one benefit; the majority had 2-3 benefits, with disability and health benefits being the most common

### Research Questions

-   Why do participants log in to VA.gov?

-   What do people think the difference should be between the profile and dashboard/logged-in homepage?

-   Should there be a meaningful difference?

-   What content do people expect to see in either section?

-   What types of notifications do people expect to see?

-   Where do people expect to see/receive notifications?

-   How do we balance

    -   notification info (status update/action items),

    -   widgets (showing upcoming appointments, their local VAMC, maybe delivery updates for prescriptions, etc), and

    -   links into tools (eg. top tasks)?

Key Findings
------------

1.  Participants want a page that is focused on current information specific to them, rather than generalized information for all Veterans.
2.  Participants are primarily interested in completing healthcare and disability related tasks such as messaging, ordering medication, and checking claim status.
3.  For those interested in education benefits, GI Bill balance and payment information was important.
4.  Easy access to documents from the homepage was important to participants.
5.  Participants were interested in benefit recommendations and eligibility information.
6.  Participants were interested in information that helps them be more involved with the VA as a whole, and take better care of themselves. 
7.  Participants expect a mix of links and widgets to complete tasks on their homepage, and want clear labels to understand next steps.
8.  Most participants didn't see "profile" items as totally separate from benefit items. Some wanted to see or have access to "profile" information right on their logged-in homepage.
9.  Participants typically look for notifications in the top portion of a page, but expect notifications from the VA outside of their logged-in experience.
10.  A design like the blue sky prototype ([see screenshot in Appendix](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md#appendix)) will be useful to Veterans. 

Details of Findings
-------------------

### Participants want a page that is focused on current information specific to them, rather than generalized information for all Veterans.

Participants prioritized information that applies directly to them on their personalized homepage. When naming the most important items to see upon logging in, 10 out of 10 of participants listed items that were specific to them such as "my prescriptions" and "updates to my claims".  When discussing the current logged-in homepage, participants expressed that having to hunt through a list of irrelevant links to find whatever they came to do is frustrating and slows them down.

> "Don't toot your horn on my page. Let me take care of my stuff, and I can get out of there."

> "I don't need that [education block on current logged-in homepage] for me. It has nothing to do with healthcare. Nothing. Disability thing...having it on my health page does me absolutely no good."

> "I think that [the page they created] would be 100%. I wouldn't have to do so much thinking on my part if I had something like this done where I can go in, and I can see it."

**Implications:** 

1.  We should minimize content on the logged-in homepage that is not specific to the user. 

2.  Our design needs to scale so that users with many benefits can find exactly what they've logged in to do just as easily as users who may have only one or two items on their logged-in homepage.

### Participants are primarily interested in completing healthcare and disability related tasks such as messaging, ordering medication, and checking claim status.

During the interview portion of the sessions, all participants stated they log in regularly to complete tasks related to their health and/or disability benefits.  The personalized page they created supported this, as all participants created a task-focused page.  

Health care beneficiaries prioritized the following items:

-   Secure messaging

-   Appointments

-   Summary of what occurred in an appointment

-   Ordering prescriptions and medical supplies

-   Medical records (downloading and sharing with community care locations)

-   Lab and test results (current and over time)

-   Beneficiary travel

-   Their VA Medical Center (where they primarily receive care)

-   Community Care locations

> "That [Rx and appointments] would be a great thing to see first thing on the page where I log in. That way I don't have to go hunting for where my appts are."

Those with disability benefits were most interested in tasks related to claims, confirming accuracy of payments, and occasionally, to download benefit letters and other documents.  The following disability items were prioritized on pages:

-   Rated disabilities
-   Claim status (this mattered slightly less to participants with a very low or very high disability rating; they felt their rating "is what it is" and would not change)
-   Benefit letters
-   File a secondary claim or to increase rating
-   Upload requested documents
-   Payment history

Participants with lower disability ratings generally placed disability information near the bottom of their page (low priority).  Some participants with disability benefits also added secondary priority items:

-   Vocational Rehabilitation information (how-to, and what to fill out)
-   Housing grant balance
-   Additional benefits available to them and their dependents, based on their disability rating

Many log in at least 2-3 times per month to VA.gov to go to My HealtheVet (MHV) or eBenefits, and move around between the sites. Participants were not always clear about exactly where they were logging in and expressed a feeling of being bounced around and going back and forth trying to complete their tasks. 

**Implications:** 

1.  The logged-in homepage should prioritize information associated with these benefits and provide users with direct ways to complete the relevant tasks. 

2.  Our design also needs to scale to support secondary benefits (e.g. housing grants based on disability rating) on the logged-in homepage. 

3.  We can help Veterans feel grounded and create a more efficient, seamless experience for them if we bring in tasks from MHV, eBenefits and VA.gov to one centralized place.

### For those interested in education benefits, GI Bill balance and payment information was most important. 

About a third of the participants added education benefit related items to their page, typically as a mid-priority item. They were specifically interested in:

-   GI Bill benefits balance
-   Details on how benefit has been paid out

> "If I would've known [GI Bill benefits balance], I would have gotten  $1200 a month instead of 600 a month if I took an extra class."

A few participants mentioned saving their entire GI Bill benefit for their children.

**Implications:** 

1. Benefits outside of the high-priority health and disability categories are important to users, and should be accounted for on the logged-in homepage.  
2. Information about how education benefits can be passed on to dependents would be useful to Veterans.
3. The participants we recruited in the under 34 age group weren't able to make their session.  We should make sure the next user study for the logged-in homepage includes younger Veterans so that we can validate the priority of education benefit information, and exactly what information is needed.

### Easy access to documents from the homepage was important for participants.

All participants had something on their homepage related to documents or records, and a few participants went a step further and created a dedicated section for all VA documents (examples below).  They expected to see a button or link on their homepage that would take them to a central place for all documents. The participants that did not create this section weren't confident about how these items fit with the rest of the content on their pages. 

-   Eligibility packet created by the VA 

-   Award letters 

-   Military history

-   DD214 

-   Uploading documents, and viewing previous documents they uploaded 

> "When you leave the military, you learn real quickly if you don't have it, it doesn't exist. So you want to keep it no matter what in case there are errors or something happens, you cover yourself." - Participant discussing importance of easy access to documents

**Implications:**  Veterans would likely find a dedicated space for all documents helpful, and do not need to see all documents listed out on their logged-in homepage.

### Participants were interested in benefit recommendations and eligibility information. 

Although current benefit information is their priority, multiple participants created items for their page that would help them maximize their VA benefits. One participant commented that while there are a lot of links on the current logged-in homepage, they serve as a helpful reminder of what's available.  Specific items added by participants:

-   Information on Choice program

-   Access to general health care information 

-   Other benefits they or their dependents can get based on their disability rating

-   Information on Vocational Rehab, and what documents would be needed to apply. 

-   Options for using their remaining GI Bill balance

-   Information how how their education benefit could be used by their dependents

Another participant referenced an eligibility packet they received that was specific to what they were approved for. It was useful, but the participant felt it would have been more so if it had also included other resources they could explore.

> "Anything that pertains to disability benefits based off of rating. If you're fully rated, you can get a free education pass."

> "More info on health benefits. I know they're there, but I don't know how to use them"

**Implications:** 

1.  We should provide users with information on additional benefits they can receive based on what we know about the benefits already they have. For example, if a Veteran with a 100% disability rating hasn't applied for the housing grant, surface information on that benefit.
2.  We'll need to leverage the data we have on the logged-in user to determine what we display to ensure we're providing relevant benefit recommendations.

### Participants were interested in information that helps them be more involved with the VA as a whole, and take better care of themselves. 

People were interested in general updates from the VA that could impact them such as new laws or policies, and upcoming webinars from the VA. A couple mentioned that they'd want to be informed about changes on the website (e.g. content has moved or been added) on their personalized page.

> "That would be really good to have on the homepage so I feel little more involved in what is going on. Because right now I kind of feel disconnected."

Participants also added items related to self-care and community to their pages.  Wellness related items were especially important for the older Veterans we spoke to.

-   Community events at their local VAMC 

-   Online events targeted to Veterans 

-   Managing chronic pain and conditions 

-   Mindfulness training 

-   Nutrition education

-   Information on local support centers for Veterans 

> "I know there's a place that's really good for people like myself who are moving into a new house and we have no furniture. They have a room where you can pick out a couple items of things you need. That would be great [on my page]."

**Implications:** 

1.  Veterans will find it helpful to see information about VA changes or updates that impact them (policies, laws, content/tools on VA.gov).
2.  Veterans will find it helpful to see information about events and Veteran resources local to them based on their address.
3.  Veterans are interested in learning more about self-care and wellness, and trust the VA to provide that information.  If possible, we should elevate that kind of information in meaningful ways based on what we know about the Veterans health, age, and phase of life.
4.  We'll need to leverage the data we have on the logged-in user to determine what we display to ensure relevancy.

### Participants expect a mix of links and widgets to complete tasks on their homepage, and want clear labels to understand next steps.

We asked participants to describe their typical experience on VA.gov, and the  link-heavy approach of the current logged-in homepage frequently came up as being overwhelming.  Participants feel they have to hunt around to complete their tasks.

> "I would like to be able to click and reorder my prescriptions right there so I don't have to go to five different pages to finally get to it. Right now it's a drill down process that's horrible."

When designing their own page, participants expected a variety of ways to complete their tasks. The majority of participants created links from their personalized page for more detailed tasks like reviewing records. For straightforward tasks like refilling a prescription or scheduling an appointment, participants described completing the task right on their page.  Many participants weren't always sure if it would be a link or a button, but were confident that the label would clearly set expectations about  what would happen next if they clicked.

> "Disabilities you're approved for, once you click on there, there could be a link there that goes to track your disabilities and it breaks down your ratings, and has claims and appeals information."

Participants referenced design patterns from the private sector as things that would be helpful to them, such as a Google calendar to manage important dates (refill available or appointment coming up), or an "`I want to` drop down menu like I see on my bank". 

![](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/session-notes/p9.png)

**Implications:** 

1.  There isn't a single "link or widget" solution that will be most useful to complete tasks. The complexity of the task and depth of information available around a particular item should drive our design decisions about providing next steps for users.  

2.  Using common practices from the private sector to inform our designs may help users more easily adapt to the new design.

### Most participants didn't see "profile" items as totally separate from benefit items. Some wanted to see or have access to "profile" information right on their logged-in homepage.

Participants didn't verbalize strong feelings about differentiating between a profile and dashboard, and many said they didn't know when asked about the difference at the end of the session.  When going through the exercise, however, they clearly separated what we define as profile information from other items. This suggests that they are familiar with this way of organizing content and there should be a meaningful difference, even if they don't all outwardly use the term "profile". The following items were commonly grouped together: 

-   Personal information

-   Contact information

-   Update username/password

-   Dependents

-   Your VA Medical Center

-   Military service history

Participants who wanted to see or have access to this information from their personalized page put those items under labels like "My Info", "Personal Information", "Profile", "History/Settings" and "Demographic Information"

4 of the 10 participants weren't interested in including profile information on the page at all because they knew the VA had that information already so they had no need to review or access it. 

> "If my letter is coming in my name and has my address, then I don't care [to see it on my homepage] because it's right. You get killed by duplication of that."

**Implications:**  

1.  The way we're thinking about profile content aligns with how Veterans think about that information. 

2.  We'll need to consider how people access this information when revisiting the authenticated IA and navigation.  This study suggests giving access to a separate profile section from the logged-in homepage will be useful to Veterans who want that information, while keeping it out of the way of those who don't.

3.  A small section on the logged in homepage with a few important profile details, with a link or button out to a profile section, would probably work for most Veterans.

### Participants typically look for notifications in the top portion of a page, but expect notifications from the VA outside of their logged-in experience.

Notifications didn't organically come up in most sessions, and when they did, oftentimes the participant referenced a phone call or email. They didn't demonstrate a mental model of expecting notifications to appear on their logged-in homepage.

> "The notification thing? Send me an email. Send me a message, I may or may not check it. The email, definitely - that's where I get anything important."

Once prompted, participants said notifications about important updates and action items would be useful to them. These specific notifications were added to participants pages:

-   Prescription refills available

-   Appointment reminders and cancellations

-   Changes in benefits

-   Updates to claim status

-   Deadlines (e.g. number of days before something is due)

-   Updates/changes to the website

> "It would have been nice to have a message telling us 'hey this is new to chapter 31' so I wouldn't have had to go through with that process [of researching it on their own]."

There wasn't a clear consensus on one place for notifications to appear within the page itself. About half of the participants talked about general, VA-wide notifications appearing at the top of the page, with notifications about a specific item on their page would be in-line with the item. Other participants talked about all notifications appearing in the navigation or upper right corner of the page. Participants easily understood, and reacted positively to the in-line notifications associated with each section on the blue-sky prototype. 

> "The way you had it laid out on the demo page was perfect."

![](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/images/personalization-blue-sky-dashboard-notification.png)

**Implications:** 

1.  Veterans will find notifications on the logged-in homepage helpful, and will typically look for them somewhere at the top of the page.  

2.  It will be worth exploring in-line notifications as well (similar to what is on the Claims card in the blue sky prototype dashboard), and testing different approaches with users. 

3.  Since Veterans are so used to email, mail and phone calls from the VA, we shouldn't rely strictly on logged-in homepage notifications to communicate important information to Veterans in the initial roll-out of the new design.

### A design like the blue sky prototype would be useful to Veterans.

The blue sky prototype was extremely well received by 6 of the 8 of participants who saw it (this was added as an additional task after the first 2 sessions). They found many aspects of the blue sky prototype design helpful and easier to understand than the current logged-in homepage.  

![](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/images/personalization-blue-sky-dashboard-cropped.png)

-   The information summary and clear call to action in each card provided an at-a-glance understanding of the status of each item. People felt the information in each card related to their benefit was useful - some even stated it was exactly what they wanted to see.

-   Participants understood the `View All` links in each card would take them to another page with further detail, and felt that made sense and would be easy to use.

-   The sidebar navigation let participants know all the content available to them.

-   Participants found the content in the right hand sidebar was useful and interesting. They usually commented on after the other two, signifying that this layout is successful in helping users focus on the highest priority items. 

-   The use of color in the prototype was also helpful for participants to understand various states of information in each card - participants called out the blue dot to indicate an unread message, yellow warning alert (see previous finding for example), and red text signifying a payment due. (Note that it is not recommended to rely solely on color to communicate important information for colorblind users).

> "Do mine like this...somebody got in my head, this is perfect."

> "I like the thing on the left hand side, you click on it and it just goes to what you need."

> "I love the side here, the rating -- it shows what you're eligible for."

One participant who didn't care for this design commented on the aesthetics (too much blue) and the stacking of the cards being too much to scroll through.  The other found it overwhelming, but stated if they could collapse or remove the content they weren't interested in, it would be a helpful dashboard for them..

**Implications:** 

1.  The blue sky prototype design is a strong starting point for the redesign of the logged-in homepage.

2.  The reaction of participants in this study suggests that this design strikes the right balance of information, widgets, links, and notifications.  

3.  Adding customization or presentation controls such as expand/collapse toggles would meet the needs of users who need to fine-tune the presentation of content.

Additional Insights
-------------------

### Veterans are interested in being able to customize their logged-in homepage.

A few participants mentioned that having the ability to customize would be useful to them. One in particular who felt the blue sky prototype was too overwhelming said it would be useful if she could hide the things she didn't want to see.

> "If we could set up our pages how we want to - 'these are the top 6 things that matter to me' and have them at the top of the page, that would be awesome."

**Implications:** As the new logged-in experience matures, adding customization features would increase user satisfaction. This type of functionality would also make our design more scalable.

### There is ambiguity around whether dependent information, rated disabilities, and Your VA Medical Center (VAMC) belong on the profile or the logged-in homepage.

There wasn't a consistent place participants placed Your Dependents. Of the 7 participants who were interested in the info, 4 put it in their profile, 2 put it it's own section, 1 placed it with disability benefit information

> "Dependents, I think that should be under my profile. You say you're married and it would drop down and ask you who your spouse is. It would tell you all of the things you need to do. That would have been very helpful for me."

The "Your Rated Disabilities" item was also placed inconsistently by participants. A few participants placed it by itself on their page, while others grouped it with personal information, and others with other disability benefit items.

Your VAMC was sometimes organized into a healthcare grouping, and other times placed in the profile grouping.

**Implications:** We may need to provide more than one access point to this information to meet user expectations. We should ask more specific questions around this when we test our design with users. 

### Participants expected "Your Community Care locations" to be dynamic.

Multiple participants who added that item to their personalized page expected that it would reflect locations based on where they were when they logged in, and wanted it on their page so they could find places to get treatment if needed when traveling.

> "If I was traveling or out of state or an area I'm not used to and I'm not feeling well I can go look it up right there and find it, vs. trying to have a web page."

**Implications:** 

1.  Veterans expect VA.gov to be aware of their location and provide them with personalized information based on that. 

2.  Location-based awareness would be useful to Veterans on their logged-in homepage. 

3.  We should ensure that however Community Care locations are  included on their page (if at all), the labeling sets the right expectation.

### Participants want more options to communicate electronically with the VA.

This frequently came up during discussions around uploading documents, supplemental claims, and filing appeals. Participants shared stories about slow back and forth communication to get things done, having to print and fax/mail documents, and things getting lost in the mail.

> "It kind of sucks that when a claim is denied, you have to either mail it or fax a supplemental claim. I wish I could email it, instead of having to mail or fax."

**Implications:** Our design should include any electronic methods users have to communicate with the VA, and scale to accommodate additional methods as the modernization effort continues across the agency.

### Participants perceive a lack of accountability and want more detailed information on their claim status, status of documents they've submitted, and cancelled appointments.

As participants added items related to those categories to their personalized page, they talked about their items containing more details than they currently receive so they would know what was going on.  At least two participants specifically said they wanted to know more so there would be a sense of accountability and they knew someone at the VA was actually working on their item. They were strictly looking for more information and did not expect to be able to take any action based on the status update.

> "Claim status - it would be nice if there was better accountability of where it was and what's happening. It's always very vague. It'd be nice to know if someone actually has this on their desk or not."

 **Implication:** We can increase Veterans confidence in the VA and build trust if we provide more information in status updates or when someone on the VA side makes a change like cancelling an appointment.

### Participants talked about recently having visited VA.gov to look at information pertaining to less common benefits such as VA home loans and life insurance.

There were less common benefits that participants brought up in sessions such as VA home loans and life insurance.  Participants that had these didn't prioritize them on their homepage, but the fact that they discussed them in relation to a recent visit to VA.gov suggests they are still important to them.

**Implication:** Veterans look for information on less popular benefits and we should take that content into consideration when planning for the content and IA of our logged-in homepage.
