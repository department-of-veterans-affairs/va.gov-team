Logged-in homepage: Discovery summary 
=============================================

**Digital Services Veterans Affairs (DSVA), VSA, Authenticated Experience**

Background
----------

Based on the [2019 Personalization 2.0 strategy](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/personalization%202.0/discovery-research/README.md), the Authenticated Experience team is pursuing a redesign of the existing logged-in homepage on VA.gov. At a high level, this will involve retiring the current My VA dashboard and bringing people’s personal information right to their homepages.

To guide this work, we completed a discovery engagement that aimed to help us answer the following questions:

-   Why do people come to VA.gov? What do they do on VA.gov?
-   How might their experience be improved with an updated logged-in homepage and status updates/notifications?
-   Which tasks are Veterans completing on other VA websites (e.g. eBenefits)?
-   What are other websites and apps doing for logged in homepages and status updates/notifications?
-   How are teams other than Authenticated Experience affected by an improved logged in homepage experience?
-   What risks do we need to be aware of?

Key findings
------------

### People want a task-based logged-in homepage tailored to them.

We conducted user research in which we asked participants to create the page they wanted to see when they logged in. One thing was clear in these sessions — [Veterans want a task-based, personalized homepage](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md#participants-want-a-page-that-is-focused-on-current-information-specific-to-them-rather-than-generalized-information-for-all-veterans). The pages they created demonstrated they knew exactly what they needed to manage their experiences with the VA. When asked about the current logged-in homepage experience, many Veterans expressed that they were confused or frustrated by all the links on the logged-in homepage that aren't relevant to them.

>  "Don't toot your horn on my page. Let me take care of my stuff, and I can get out of there."

The pages our users created:

- Gave them access to their most important tasks in one place.
- Provided them with important updates.
- Guided them to benefit information and recommendations.
- Minimized content that wasn't specific to them.

*Example of a page created in our user session. User created a personalized homepage with dedicated section linking off to other pages (education page shown as example)*.

Stakeholders described this type of task-based, personalized experience as [one of their goals](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/stakeholder-interviews/stakeholder-interview-synthesis.md#stakeholder-goals) during our interviews. We also saw this standard set in our [comparative analysis](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/comparative-analysis.md#site-examples), in which every private-sector site we looked at had a tailored logged-in experience. Analytics also confirm that [logged-in users are very task-oriented compared to logged-out users](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/analytics/analytics-summary.md#logged-in-vs-logged-out-why-do-people-come-to-the-site-what-do-they-do-here).

**Recommendations**

1.  We should focus the logged-in homepage on helping Veterans complete tasks as directly as possible (not linking them through multiple content pages to get to where they want to go).
2.  We should minimize content on the logged-in homepage that is not specific to the user.
3.  We should leverage data to intelligently provide users with benefit recommendations and guide them to information about benefits they don't have.

### Health care and disability benefits are king.

Veterans are primarily using VA.gov to manage their health care and disability claims. In user research, we saw these items prioritized in almost every session, echoing [the findings from brand consolidation research conducted in 2018](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/previous-research-review.md#brand-consolidation). This makes sense — these benefits require more management and active engagement (e.g. regularly ordering medication, checking for updates on a claim) when compared to other benefits, so veterans want easy access to these tools on their homepages.

Pageview data also supports this finding: the [claim status tool is the most popular tool](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/analytics/analytics-summary.md#on-the-modernized-site-vagov-the-claim-status-tool-is-king) on VA.gov (~60MM views between April 2019 and April 2020), and [the tools on MyHealtheVet also have a significant amount of pageviews](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/analytics/analytics-summary.md#in-the-non-modernized-data-vagov-plus-mhv-ebenefits-etc-we-can-see-just-how-important-health-care-management-is-to-the-veteran-population) (~56MM for secure messaging, ~47MM for prescription refills, and ~25MM for viewing lab/test results).

**Recommendations** 

1.  The logged-in homepage should prioritize benefit information associated with health care (e.g. secure messaging, appointment management, and prescription management) and disability benefits (e.g. rated disabilities, claim status tool, and benefit letters). A more detailed list of items participants prioritized in our research study is [outlined in the summary of our findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/69833737d9fe22b8990bb987e7c50de13205c5d5/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md#participants-are-primarily-interested-in-completing-healthcare-and-disability-related-tasks-such-as-messaging-ordering-medication-and-checking-claim-status).
2.  We should explore whether we can provide users a way to complete health and disability tasks from their logged-in homepage.

### Veterans care about anything they have in flight, whether that is education or other benefits.

Participants in our research study demonstrated that Veterans want to see information about any of their active benefits. Education benefits were most common outside of health and disability; we also saw this as a priority in the [2018 brand consolidation research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/previous-research-review.md#brand-consolidation). In our sessions, participants were particularly [interested in seeing GI Bill balance and payment information](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md#for-those-interested-in-education-benefits-gi-bill-balance-and-payment-information-was-most-important) on their homepages. They also brought up VA home loans and life insurance as current benefits that they had recently looked up on VA.gov.

Analytics further underscore the importance of education information for logged-in users, [with ~4MM views for the GI Bill statement of benefits](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/analytics/analytics-summary.md#logged-in-users-are-more-interested-in-checking-the-status-of-their-benefits-or-accessing-their-records) in the last year.

**Recommendation:** On the logged-in homepage, we need to account for all in-flight items users have.

### Records and documents are a focus for Veterans.

All participants in our research study had [something on their homepages related to documents or records](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md#easy-access-to-documents-from-the-homepage-was-important-for-participants), and many named downloading or looking for a document as the most recent task they had completed on VA.gov.  This is consistent with the 2018 brand consolidation research, during which [records were listed as a priority](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/previous-research-review.md#brand-consolidation). Additionally, the [benefit planning, applications, and claims research conducted by Frog in 2016](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/files/4446518/D5_frog_VCRD_ResearchReadout_final.pdf) details how critical records are to Veterans who are filing disability claims (see page 48), and a Veteran in our study supported this when explaining why easy access to documents mattered to them:

> "When you leave the military, you learn real quickly if you don't have it, it doesn't exist. So you want to keep it no matter what in case there are errors or something happens, you cover yourself."

Analytics show us [huge numbers of page views for downloading personal records](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/analytics/analytics-summary.md#claims-va-letters-and-profile-information-are-all-popular-next-steps-from-my-va) (Blue button ~12.5MM; MHV's "Download My Data" tool ~8.8MM), and that [downloading VA benefit letters is a popular next step from My VA](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/analytics/analytics-summary.md#claims-va-letters-and-profile-information-are-all-popular-next-steps-from-my-va). We also see [high numbers of search terms](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/analytics/analytics-summary.md#people-are-searching-for-general-health-and-benefit-information-forms-and-some-specific-tasks-we-may-want-to-do-a-better-job-of-elevating) for documents like the certificate of eligibility or DD214.

**Recommendations**

1. Preserve the direct access to records and documents we currently provide on the logged-in homepage.
2. We should consider further elevating these items in our authenticated navigation.
3. We should explore whether or not creating a centralized space for records and documents would be an impactful improvement for Veterans.

### The logged-in homepage needs to scale to support every phase of the Veteran lifecycle.

[Veteran journey maps](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/previous-research-review.md#journey-maps) help us understand how Veterans' needs change throughout their lives, and illustrate how important it is that VA.gov can adapt to meet these changes.  The personalized pages created in our study ([screenshots in GH repo](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/session-notes)) drive this point home; each Veteran tailored their homepage based on their current circumstances with the VA.

Multiple participants had recently visited VA.gov to [learn more about benefits](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md#participants-were-interested-in-benefit-recommendations-and-eligibility-information) (such as Voc Rehab or how dependents could use benefits) and stated that they are interested in broader [information about the VA](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md#participants-were-interested-in-information-that-helps-them-be-more-involved-with-the-va-as-a-whole-and-take-better-care-of-themselves) that could impact them.  A few participants were also interested in general wellness information. This tells us that Veterans want to learn more about how to engage with the VA beyond their existing benefits.

In the Personalization 2.0 research, we learned about the [importance of an onboarding experience for separating service members](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/personalization%202.0/discovery-research/README.md#we-need-an-onboarding-experience). This emphasizes how critical it is that our homepage is equally useful for the Veteran who has no benefits as it is for the Veteran who has many.

**Recommendations**

1.  Our design needs to scale to meet the needs of all Veterans, whether they have many benefits or whether they are engaging with the VA for the first time.
2.  Ensure the logged-in homepage helps Veterans explore new benefits, get updates from the VA, and find broader healthcare information on the logged-in homepage.
3.  We should create an onboarding experience for separating service members.

### The existing "blue sky" prototype gets a lot of things right.

[Most participants in our study responded positively to the authenticated experience blue sky prototype created in 2018](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md#a-design-like-the-blue-sky-prototype-would-be-useful-to-veterans) and were excited by the possibility that their logged-in homepages could look like that.  Participants found the content, sidebar navigation, recommendations, and local information to be helpful, usable, and scannable.

> "Do mine like this...somebody got in my head, this is perfect."

The prototype's content prioritization and layout aligns with [what we saw on private sector dashboards](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/comparative-analysis.md#how-do-sites-organize-different-types-of-content-within-a-single-logged-in-homepagedashboard-view) as well; it emphasizes tasks, provides a summary or snapshot of information, clearly communications updates, and links users to more detailed information.

![](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/images/personalization-blue-sky-dashboard-cropped.png)

*Blue sky prototype shown in our user sessions.*

**Recommendation**: We should consider leveraging elements of this design as we move on to mockups.

### Veterans expect a mix of links and widgets to complete tasks from their homepage.

When designing their personalized pages, [participants in our research study expected to complete tasks in different ways](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md#participants-expect-a-mix-of-links-and-widgets-to-complete-tasks-on-their-homepage-and-want-clear-labels-to-understand-next-steps). Most participants relied on links to get to tasks like reviewing records, but some participants also wanted to complete tasks right on their pages (eg. checking claim statuses or refilling prescriptions).  

In our comparative analysis, we saw that [this mix of links and widgets is common on task-based dashboards](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/comparative-analysis.md#site-examples). We also saw that participants were influenced by other patterns, such as [task-based drop down menus]( https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/comparative-analysis.md#what-appears-as-a-widget-vs-text-link-vs-something-else) that we saw on private sector sites.

![](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/session-notes/p9.png)

*Example of page created by participant in our session who created dropdown menus inspired by their banking experience.*

**Recommendations**

1.  We should investigate allowing users to complete tasks on the homepage. For more complex tasks, links into tools are likely still a more appropriate solution. 
2.  Leveraging patterns seen in the private sector will help the new homepage feel more familiar to users.

### The homepage needs to be supported by a cohesive logged-in navigation.

Veterans found the sidebar navigation in the blue sky prototype helpful because it provided them with a scannable list of sections and tools. It’s not surprising this resonated with users; we can infer from the prevalence of [authenticated navigations in our comparative analysis](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/comparative-analysis.md#how-does-an-authenticated-toolbarmenu-fit-into-the-overall-site-navigation) that this is a common approach in the private sector. We also know from [analytics that logged-in users are more task-focused]( https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/analytics/analytics-summary.md#logged-in-vs-logged-out-why-do-people-come-to-the-site-what-do-they-do-here), so it’s no surprise Veterans were excited by the prototype.

Problems with the navigation also came up during [stakeholder interviews](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/stakeholder-interviews/stakeholder-interview-synthesis.md#perceived-problems-with-the-current-ux), primarily:

1.  It doesn’t change once you’re logged in, which gives little sense of personalization.
2.  We’re not effectively guiding logged-in Veterans with our navigation; the multitude of options require significant cognitive load for the user to sort through and find the task they need to complete.

Because of this, we can see that [users have to reorient themselves on the homepage](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/analytics/analytics-summary.md#most-people-start-directly-on-the-homepage-but-some-people-reorient-themselves-their-throughout-their-session) throughout their sessions. This further emphasizes that a task-focused navigation would benefit users and provide easier access to the items that matter most to them.

**Recommendations**

1.  We should provide a logged-in navigation that is task-focused to help users move more efficiently through VA.gov.	
2.  Collaborate and coordinate with IA and Public Websites on a navigation strategy.

### Veterans want new information to be clear to them when they log in, and expect to receive new information through multiple channels.

We specifically asked Veterans in our user study where or how they would expect to receive notifications and updates about items on the pages they created. Most said they expect that kind of information to come via a phone call, email, or physical mail, either because that's what they're used to, or because it's the easiest way to reach them.  

When we gave the prompt to imagine they could get updates right on their pages, Veterans placed [updates and notifications near the top](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md#participants-typically-look-for-notifications-in-the-top-portion-of-a-page-but-expect-notifications-from-the-va-outside-of-their-logged-in-experience), but there wasn't one consistent placement across the sessions. Despite that lack of consistency, this tells us what is most important is that the updates are clear and hard to miss. One participant went so far as to say they wanted it in a big red bulls-eye in the middle of their page so they couldn't miss it.

In our comparative analysis, we saw [new information displayed in the top portion](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/comparative-analysis.md#how-are-sites-implementing-alerts-and-notifications) of logged-in homepages, often in a dedicated notification center. Some examples also included notifications right on the dashboard itself. The blue sky prototype primarily had notifications right on the homepage, which Veterans found helpful.

![](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/images/personalization-blue-sky-dashboard-notification.png)

*Detail of in-line notification style shown in blue sky prototype.*

**Recommendations**

1.  We should include notifications on the logged-in homepage, somewhere at the top of the page.
2.  We should test different approaches to notification placement, including a dedicated Notification center, alert-style banners at the top of the page, and notifications in-line with the item in question (as seen on the Claims section in the blue sky prototype).
3.  Consider the various channels of communication the VA uses to reach out to Veterans as VA.gov's notification experience matures.

## Moving forward

### Approaching the logged-in homepage redesign iteratively

[In stakeholder interviews](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/stakeholder-interviews/stakeholder-interview-synthesis.md#perceived-project-risks), one of the main concerns raised was that a logged-in homepage redesign could easily suffer from endless churn. In order to avoid this, we have outlined an initial approach to scope the project into manageable pieces.

First, we'll break this work into three projects:

- The logged-in homepage redesign.
- Creation of a logged-in navigation.
- Creation of a notification center.

We'll work on the logged-in homepage redesign first. As time and resources allow, work on the logged-in navigation (in partnership with the IA and public websites teams) and notification center.

For the logged-in homepage redesign, we'll break the project into at least three phases:

- **Phase 1**: Transfer the personalized information currently on My VA (in progress-application and claims; benefit info) to the logged-in homepage; Retire My VA.
- **Phase 2**: Improvements to phase 1; Addition of features if applicable.
- **Phase 3**: Improvements to the first-time user experience; Potential benefit recommendations.
  - Note: We will have a basic first-time user experience in phase 1.

### Developing design patterns for authenticated tools

This project’s success hinges on updating the existing patterns we have in our design system. Currently, patterns cater to unauthenticated content, which has left us with a lengthy and [cluttered mess on My VA](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/personalization%202.0/discovery-research#observations-visual-design). There is a ton of great, personalized information on this page, but it is buried because we don’t currently have patterns that handle this kind of content well. 

Having a scannable dashboard matters — we’ve seen that in the [positive reaction to the blue sky prototype](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md#a-design-like-the-blue-sky-prototype-would-be-useful-to-veterans) — so we want to work with the VA platform team to figure out the best way to display authenticated content in a scalable, flexible way.

### Conducting regular user testing 

The existing homepage, created as part of the 2018 redesign, [went through multiple rounds of user testing before launch](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/previous-research-review.md#brand-consolidation). Given the amount of traffic that the new logged-in homepage will get, and that we’ll be changing the [wildly popular top 20 tasks](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/analytics/analytics-summary.md#from-the-homepage-people-primarily-navigate-into-the-tools-displayed-in-the-top-20-tasks), we should strive to conduct user testing at more than one point in each phase to make sure we’re getting things right.

### Stakeholder management

While we’re **not** changing anything about the logged-out homepage, we’ll need to review the new logged-in approach with stakeholders both inside and outside of DEPO. In order to not end up in a cycle of endless churn, we plan to:

-	Have a strong strategy based on user research (this document!).
-	Lead with strong recommendations based on user insights and analytics when sharing work.  
-	Be strategic about when and how we engage stakeholders outside of DEPO.

### Measuring the right metrics

We want the new logged-in homepage to be measured in more than page views (which will already be high because it’s the homepage) and link clicks (which are important, but not the whole story). We’re currently figuring out our objectives so we can guide this work accordingly and get the right analytics in place to tell us how we’re doing.

Preliminarily, we are thinking about monitoring:

-	How the logged-in homepage affects conversions for the different tasks it features.
-	How well we guide veterans with no benefits or applications.
-	How/if the new logged-in homepage affects how many people log-in and how often they log-in.

## Immediate next steps

Following this report, we plan to pursue this work as follows:

-	Hand off this work between Liz Lantz (public websites) and the authenticated experience team.
-	Start moving into design planning.
-	Figure out specific next steps for discussing this work with stakeholders outside DEPO.
-	Continue working on OKRs & KPIs and getting analytics set up.
-	Start technical discovery.
-	Start initial phase 1 design iterations.
