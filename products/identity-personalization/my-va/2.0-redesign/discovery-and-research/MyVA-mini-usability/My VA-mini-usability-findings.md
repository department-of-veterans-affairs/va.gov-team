## Overview

We're in the final stages of build for the new My VA dashboard on va.gov. Since we were using prototypes for previous usability studies, we were unable to test with real data. We conducted this internal study using real data on production to help us understand a few things listed below.

1. Does our solution present any usability hurdles?
2. Does the overall layout we are launching with make sense to users?
3. How can we better elevate action items on a user dashboard?

We ran 6 moderated sessions on Zoom with internal colleagues who are also Veterans.
- No users had claims
- 4 out of 6 users were enrolled in health care. (1 uses it often, 2 uses it periodically, and 1 hardly ever uses it)
- 2 users had disability ratings 
- 1 mobile, 5 desktop

## Findings and correlating recommendations

1. Users easily understood how to use the page and what the page was for. 
2. Users were easily able to complete tasks in all sections.
3. Users who had a disability rating easily understood how to use it and thought it was useful on the page.
  > "I usually check my disability rating and my payment history - so that's a big win."

4. All users stated that they would expect to see notifications on this page.
  >"I want to see anything that I have upcoming."
  >"I'd like to know if there's anything that I need to do, or if I'm missing anything."
  >"I'd just want to know what my top 'action items' are."

  - **Recommendation**: We know from previous studies that this is something users want on their dashboard. We plan to start working on figuring out the notification functionality next. This study definitely validated the need for this work. 

5. Users who were both enrolled in health care and were actively using VA health care found My VA to be useful (even if they did not have any claims).
  > "This seems like a good jumping off point, and it seems really useful.'
  > "I'm so excited to see all of these links in one place, it's usually so difficult to try to get things done"

6. Users who were NOT enrolled in health care and had NO claims, did not find the page to be especially useful. Many of these users expressed they would not use My VA. A few of these users felt that the dashboard wasn't personalized enough.

  - **Recommendation**: We need to explore ways to make the dashboard more valuable to users who do NOT have claims or health care.  We may also need to do additonal research around this to understand what that specific type of user would be looking to do from their dashboard. 
  
7. Users are interested in learning more about what benefits are available to them, most wanted to see what they were eligible for. Interestingly, almost all users interacted heavily with the 'What benefits does VA offer?' dropdown.

 - **Recommendation**: We may want to explore ways to elevate benefits that the VA offers on the dashboard - this work might simultaneously add more value to a user who does NOT have claims or health care.  


## Recommendations

1. We need to explore how to implement notifications - this was validated in this study.
2. We need to explore ways to make the dashboard more valuable to users who do NOT have claims or health care.  We may also need to do additonal research around this to understand what that specific type of user would be looking to do from their dashboard. 
3. We may want to explore ways to elevate benefits that the VA offers on the dashboard - this work might simultaneously add more value to a user who does NOT have claims or health care. 


## Functinality that users mentioned wanting (and the number of users who said it)

-  Notifications (6/6)
-  Payment history (3/6)
-  Customizeable dashboard (3/6)
-  Dependent information (1/6)

## Things to think about

- Do users want to see sections that have no updates for them? Is the 'no update' update important? (i.e. if all of a users claims are closed, is it important to them to see that they have no claims?)
- Would it be useful to think through how to help people who are onboarding from eBenefits vs a person who is completely new to the VA? Do those need to be different experiences?
  >"That's one of the things I like about eBenefits is that it's a one stop shop. I can literally do everything I need to do in 10 minutes and then I'll be done."
- Do we fully understand all of the health care and claims use cases? Even in this small study, we had 2 interesting health care use cases, it might be interesting to dive into that a little more.
- How do we make a dashboard more useful to people who don't have health care or claims? What would they use a dashboard for?
- How do we test with real data earlier on in a project?
