# My VA Usability Participant Notes (Internal)

## (P1) - 5.14.2021, 2 ET

**IS enrolled in health care - but hardly ever uses it, no claims**

**Easily understood:**

- how to schedule/view all appointments
- how many secure messages he had
- how to get to other secure messages
- refill/track prescriptions
- how to finish and submit an application
- What the page was for

**Didn't understand:**

N/A - he easily understood everything on the page

**Things of note:**

- He did mention a 'dashboard', and thought that was a separate page that would go into more detail.

**Appointments**
- Either wanted to see the next 3 months, or always see upcoming appointments 

**Quotes:**
- "I want to see anything that I have upcoming." (this goes along with the idea of elevating action items.)
- "This seems like a good jumping off point, and it seems really useful.'

**IS enrolled in health care - and actively uses it, no claims**

Overall, this user said he would not use My VA. He does not like the header, takes up too much space. He thinks the red crisis banner is too aggressive. He said he the only thing he would use is the schedule appointments feature, but only if it was easy. 

**Easily understood:**

- How to use the page
- Navigate to other pages
- How to get to appointments
- How to get to messages

**Didn't understand:**

N/A - he easily understood everything on the page (that doesn't mean he liked it)

**Things of note:**

**FROM LIZ**

- Was on mobile device; has never logged in through his phone before.
- loading spinner showed for a while, then claims data error displayed
- Didn't think it was useful to see his name, branch of service, or last log in date. "I don't need to see who I am when I logged in. I know I was in the army, I don't need to see that."
- He perceived the list of health care items as his "list of options" and said if he had other things (e.g. claims) he'd expect to see them there too
- Would want to be reminded of appointments above all else
- Commented that his grandfather would have a hard time figuring out how to get back to My VA after a link opened in a new tab on a mobile device. "I wish that didn't open up in a new window. Well, actually I'm okay with doing that but I know my grandfather would not be. He's going to be like "oh how do I get back to that."
- Expects to see notification alerts near the top.
- Broader feedback (maybe to pass to other teams):
- Has a negative perception of calling the VA: reading footer "Contact Us. That would be a 1/2 hour call."
- On MHV secure messaging: "messaging who? This is a mess. I would not use this. I would be frustrated."
- "One of my biggest complaints with the VA is all the words. You know, things like this (while on MHV) - the things I'm going to press and do should be at the top of the screen."
- Perceived the crisis banner to have negative implications. "Talk to the veterans crisis line now" - it's all big and read and scary. People who are [not in crisis? I think that's what he said?] would be scared to click on that - there's an implication. It's a big scary red banner that I would never click on."
- Would not use a mobile phone to complete online applications.
- "I could never imagine myself trying to apply for anything over my cell phone"

**IS NOT enrolled in health care, but IS registered at VA facilities (health care does show up for him) - but hardly ever uses it, no claims**

Overall, he understood the page and how to use it. He said he doesn't use va.gov very often and is fairly frustrated with how things are run. 

**Easily understood:**

- How to use the page
- Navigate to other pages
- How to get to appointments

**Didn't understand:**

N/A - he easily understood everything on the page (that doesn't mean he liked it)

**Things of note:**

- Participant mentioned wanting to see notifications somewhere on the page - he would like to see any action items that he had.
- Wanted it to be more personalized to him - he felt like it wasn't really that useful and that it should show benefits that he is eligible for.
- Talked about home loans, maybe seeing some financial information on the dashboard 


## (P4) - 5.17.2021, 12:30 ET

**IS enrolled in health care, uses health care but not regularly, no claims**

Overall, she liked the page and was excited to see health care links all in one place. She liked how clean and simple the design was. 

**Easily understood:**

- How to use the page
- Navigate to other pages
- How to get to appointments
- Apply for benefits section

**Didn't understand:**

N/A - she easily understood everything on the page

**Things of note:**

- She mentioned wanting to see notifications on the page - specifically things related to health care. (Check-in, appointment reminders, action items related to benefits)
- She also mentioned wanting to see her enrollment status in health care - so she could make sure she could still use it. She was unsure how that worked.

**From Liz**
- Interested in knowing what benefits are available to him - unfamiliar beyond education benefits
- First clicked on the additional info component
- "This is exactly what I wanted to see"
- "This is useful, but if you already know who I am then you may already know if I pre-qualify for any of these. Otherwise this is exactly what I'd expect to see"
- There's not a good visual separation between the sections


## (P6) - 5.17.2021, 3:30 ET

**IS enrolled in health care, uses it often, has disability rating, no current claims**

He really like the header with his name and branch of service.

**Easily understood:**

- How to use the page
- Navigate to other pages
- How to get to appointments
- Apply for benefits section

**Things of note:**

- He mentioned multiple times how much he liked having the disability rating on the page "That's a big win"
- He wanted to be able to customize the page to exactly what he needed.
- He wanted a place to see his payment history. 
- He wanted a place to see dependent information.

*Note - think about onboarding between ebenefits and MyVA vs a person who is completely new to My VA


**From Liz**
- Currently has benefits with the VA
- Top action items: "I use eBenefits quite a bit and that was my original starting point" described themself as old school
  - Typically look at my rating and my payment history to validate quite a bit. You never know if you're going to get some payments sent back. I validate my claims if there are any claims open I'll look at that.
  - _sidenote from Liz_: Interesting to think about how to help people used to eBenefits onboard to MyVA, if they have different considerations from people who are just generally new to VA (probably have already thought about that)
- Easily understood health care action items
- What's important to see? 
  - They could see a younger Veteran caring about how many claims they have pending, if the claims are scheduled. Unsure if that would be part of my VA "I don't even know if that would show up in here"
- "That's one of the things I like about eBenefits is that it's a one stop shop. I can literally do everything I need to do in 10 minutes and then I'll be done."
- Thinks the benefit suggestions at the bottom of the page are because they're the most "highly trafficked"
- Likes the disability rating in the header; wasn't sure what to expect if they clicked on it. 
  - Another participant also commented that they didn't know where they'd go if they clicked on the disability rating link, I think it was P1. 
- Payment history is missing, from their perspective
- Expressed interest in being able to customize their banner w/ favorite links
