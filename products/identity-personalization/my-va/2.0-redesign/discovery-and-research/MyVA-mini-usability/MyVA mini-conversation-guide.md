## Intro 

Thanks so much for joining us today! My name is Tressa, and today we're going to talk about the My VA dashboard on VA.gov.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session will be quick, it should take 15-20 minutes.** 
- **As always, we want to hear your honest opinions.** 
- **Please go slower than you normally would and if you could talk aloud about what you are doing, that would be great.** 
- **In this study we'll be looking at your REAL information - if at anytime you feel uncomfortable screensharing, please let me know and we can stop.** 

## Screenshare

- I'll have you log in to VA.gov, and then share your screen with me. If you need help at all, I'm happy to help.

## Warm up Questions
