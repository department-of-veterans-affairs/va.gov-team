# Initial metrics chat w/ VAOS team | 6.29.20

- #1 metric for VAOS is appointments scheduled or requested. 
- Definition of appointments scheduled: Appointments requested/scheduled on VA.gov is different than actual appointments scheduled in VISTA. On VA.gov, people can schedule or request an appointment, but it may later be determined that that appointment isn't necessary, so it ultimately is not scheduled or part of the official count of aapointments scheduled in VISTA.
- MHV is killing their scheduling feature as early as next week. Feature will fully live on VA.gov at that point. at that point, the team may see 3 - 4X the usage for the scheduling tool on VA.gov.
- As a result, the VAOS team has yet to set a baseline KR for the scheduling feature because they know they'll see a huge bump in users once MHV retires their version of the tool. 
- Secondary metric: overall satisfaction through Foresee or the mobile framework team (who has a separate tool/scale).
- Health care team may start moving over other features in the Fall. 
  - Metrics for RX: Initiating refills/renewals for RX.
  - Metrics for messages: Reading, sending, satisfaction.
- Other features to think about:
  - Clipboard feature will get built at some point.
  - Health record features.
