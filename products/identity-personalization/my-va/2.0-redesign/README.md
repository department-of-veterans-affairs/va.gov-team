## Overview

At a high level, this project aims to do the following things:

1. **Reduce redundancy** — Specifically, we should reduce redundancy between the My VA dashboard and the VA.gov homepage. This will happen in phases. As we redesign and re-launch the My VA dashboard, this frees up the homepage to be less task-management focused. As the homepage evolves away from a task management focus, it will be less redundant with My VA so both the homepage and My VA will have their own clear, unique purposes. However, in order for the homepage to evolve, we have to redesign My VA first.
2. **Elevate personally relevant information** — Users should more easily be able to scan/evaluate their information.
3. **Scale gracefully** — Our designs should allow for future updates and expansion, as new features are being added to VA.gov all the time.
4. **Prioritize wayfinding** — We should make it easy for users to find the My VA dashboard.
5. **Effectively use visual space** — We should avoid a single-column, "content page" approach. Design updates should more effectively employ the design system and update it as needed.

This came out of the [Personalization 2.0 strategy from 2019](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/personalization%202.0/discovery-research/README.md). Personalization 2.0 includes the effort to combine the profile and account pages (profile 2.0) and this effort to redesign My VA.

## Problems

Based on the research that informed [the Personalization 2.0 strategy](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/personalization%202.0/discovery-research/README.md#observations-the-my-va-dashboard), these are the main problems we've observed with regards to the My VA dashboard and the existing logged-in homepage.

- Many people don't use the My VA dashboard (~8% of users who visit va.gov go to MyVA) .
- We don't guide people to the My VA dashboard.
- The My VA dashboard is too duplicative of the homepage.
- People prefer the homepage over the My VA dashboard because it is a more effective router, and because it has a more appealing visual design.
- On My VA, we have not effectively employed [the design system](https://design.va.gov/). My VA is designed like a content page, so adding new content has made these pages extremely lengthy and hard to scan.

Additionally:

- Important content is burried on My VA. We have a lot of good status/"notification" content in there that is buried if you don't know what you are looking for.
- The logged-in homepage isn't personalized at all, so when users log in, they may see links that no longer apply to their circumstances (eg. seeing an "Apply for health care" link if you're a person who already receives VA health care).

### User Problem Statements

- **As a veteran, I want to be able to log in to VA.gov and easily find the tools and tasks that apply to my specific experience at the VA.**
- **As a veteran, I want to be able to log in to VA.gov and easily see status updates and notifications that apply to my specific experience at the VA.**
- **As a veteran, I want to be able to log in to VA.gov, quickly complete whatever I came to do, and then get back to the rest of my life.**

### Business Goals

- To lay a foundation for a user dashboard for veterans that can accomodate growth and modification over time without quickly becoming unwieldy or cluttered.
- To lay a foundation for user dashboard that could eventually be adapted to serve other user types once we're able to support more roles and permissions.
- Have a place to link to/highlight new tools so that we don't have to bury tools in content hubs where veterans can't easily find them.
- Have a place to highlight health care tools to show the potential/viability of consolidating MHV into VA.gov.
- To lay the foundation for how to better highlight status update/action item notifications for veterans.
- To move the VA (outside of DEPO)further in the direction of building/highlighting tools in one place instead of building one-off, silo'd tools.
- To create a strong enough user dashboard that the exsiting homepage no longer has to serve as a task router.

## Assumptions

- People prefer the homepage to My VA. It's both more usable and more visually appealing.
- People are reliant on the top 20 tasks on the homepage to navigate the site, and we should be mindful of this as we approach a redesign.
- Status update/alert information is hard to find on My VA.
- The new dashboard doesn't need to be too widget heavy. It needs to primarily serve as a router and a place to see status updates. Only a few widgets — e.g. upcoming appointments, your VAMC, etc — are necessary.
- This work, from a wayfinding/UX perspective, will be more successful if we accompany it with an authenticated tools menu/nav, but that may not necessarily be part of V1 of this project.

## Questions

### Design/IA

- How do veterans conceptualize the difference between a dashboard and a profile? What kind of information do they expect to see on each page?
- Do things like "Your dependents" and "Your disability rating" need to be displayed on the new dashboard, or should they be displayed on the VA.gov profile, or both?
- How could an authenticated tool bar/menu fit into the current navigation before Mikki/Ryan/Jen are able to revisit the IA and flatten the IA/nav across the board?
- Is the dashboard really the notification center? Are those two different projects, or the same project?
- How will we show notifications? Where will they "live"? How will they be marked as read/dismissed?
- What info needs to appear as a widget vs. just a link on the new dashboard?
- What works well about the current homepage that veterans don't want to change? What would veterans change about the homepage as it is now?
- How can the initial phase of the 2.0 redesign account for future growth and improvements?

### Technical

- What data do we have access to now that we can show on the dashboard? 
- Is there data we have but aren't leveraging?
- Is there data that we don't have and need?
- What data might we want for future phases/improvements?
- Is a progressive web app something we should consider in the future?

### PM

- What staging users will we need, and who can help us get those set up?
- How do we appropriately involve stakeholders, both within DEPO and outside of DEPO, in this project? How do we do this in a way that doesn't allow the homepage to become a dumping ground?
- How can we make this a seamless transition for veterans (from the existing logged-in homepage to the new logged-in homepage)?

## Solution Approach

### Discovery

- We are starting this project with a comprehensive round of discovery to help us answer questions around veteran needs and expectations, DEPO stakeholder needs and expectations, how we should involve stakeholders outside of DEPO, relevant past research and context setting, and existing models for usable and useful logged-in experiences.
- Right now, I imagine that we will only be leveraging data and tools we have access to right now on VA.gov and not integrating entirely new data/backend systems that don't already exist or aren't already in the works. While the new logged-in homepage will grow and change over time, I think this will be a helpful line for us to draw for what is included in an initial build and what we may want to build and include in future phases.

### Phase 1 plan (flexible pending technical discovery):

**In scope**

- Updating the My VA dashboard redesign, including the following sections:
  - Your applications
  - Your claims
  - Health enrollment status (eg. enrolled; application pending, etc)
  - Prescriptions
  - Secure messages
  - Schedule appointments
- A very basic first-time user experience that will account for users who have no benefits and no applications in flight.
- (Nice to have) Elevating overall disability ratings, GI bill balances, and upcoming appointments.

**Out of scope**

- **As of 10.7.2020**: Any updates to the homepage in a logged-in state.
- Doing anything with the Find VA benefits content that currently exists on My VA.
- Incorporating any new data or integrations that do not already exist on VA.gov.
- Navigation work.
- Notification center work.

## Product 

Initially, this project was scoped to be a logged-in homepage redesign. However, as of 10.7.2020, we have pivoted the project back to a My VA dashboard redesign.

**Why**

- This largely comes down to concerns about how we would have managed two different versions of the homepage, both from a technical perspective and from an organizational perspective. Organizationally, there are other teams at the VA who help manage the current homepage and we didn't want the user dashboard to get overtaken by outside needs/demands since it would have technically also been a homepage.

**How this aligns with auth exp team goals**

- A big goal of this project was removing the redundancy between the homepage and My VA in a logged in state. While we need to accept that redundancy might exist for more time, because we are redesigning My VA to be more effective and scalable, the homepage can now evolve over time, which may mean moving away from a task management focus (pending research, organizational discussions, etc). Greater variation between the homepage and the logged-in user dashboard would move us towards our goal of removing redundancy.
- If user research proves that people who login from their homepage would prefer to be redirected to their dashboard instead of staying on the homepage, then this will move us towards our goal of elevating personal information. As we add features to the user dashboard as the site grows over time, and as the homepage moves away from a task management focus, we'll have even more reason to land people logging in from the homepage on their dashboard.
- None of this stops us from pursuing the other goals of drastically improving the user dashboard and improving the logged-in experience. This is still seriously valuable work.

**Other thoughts**

- Ultimately, this approach is going to be easier for both development and design, and I think it's more "MVP", so that's good.
- Naturally, I am disappointed, as I've had big dreams of a new logged-in homepage. But I do think this makes sense from an organizational perspective and from a design/dev perspective, so that's also good.
- Users still win with a newly designed dashboard, so we're not leaving them behind.
- The logged in experience will continue to evolve. This is not an end game, and there are a lot of ways in which I think we can take this initial approach and continue to improve how people log in and manage their benefits.
