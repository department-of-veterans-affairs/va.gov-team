### When to show the messages section

**Show**

- Someone is enrolled in VA health care, even if they have no messages. We will never **not** show messaging block within the health care section.

### States
  
**State 1: Multiple new messages**  

*Messages and Prescriptions data specs*

- We have all of this data already showing on the existing My VA dashboard. It all comes through MyHealtheVet, but I don't know that we have a team to work with if we have questions about what data we have now or how this is currently set up. Please let us know ASAP if you have any concerns about the way we are handling data or how it's displayed.

*UX specs*

- This section only shows NEW/unread messages.
- **Latest message** shows the most recent unread messages someone has.
- “You have **[X] new messages**.” shows the total number of new/unread messages.
- **View all messages** links into the [messaging tool in MyHealtheVet](https://sqa.eauth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/web/myhealthevet/secure-messaging).
  - **Note**: This is the staging link. We need to confirm the link for production.

*Visual specs*

- The biggest challenge here may be the columns. We don't have many examples of handling information in columns like this on VA.gov, but we've reviewed this with some of the design leads and they agree that this treatment makes sense given that it improves scannability ove the existing single-column treatment. For an example of how we handle information in columns, please refer to the [Pittsburgh VA medical center site](https://www.va.gov/pittsburgh-health-care/).
- The blue hairline **is** an existing element, but I think it may also only exist on the [Pittsburgh VA medical center site](https://www.va.gov/pittsburgh-health-care/).
- As mentioned on the claim status specs, "You have **[X] new messages.**" is a new element. Please work with **Tressa and Cassanda** for specs.

*Copy specs*

- **All final copy is TBD**

**State 2: One new message**  

Everything is the same as the state with multiple messages, with the exception of the # of messages (ie. “You have 1 new message.”)

## Next Appointment

<details>
  <summary>Specs</summary>

### When to show the appointments section

**Show**

- Someone is enrolled in VA health care, even if they have no upcoming appointments. We will never **not** show appointments within the health care section.

### States
  
**State 1: Multiple upcoming appointments**  

*Appointments data specs*

- Currently, we do **not** show appointments data on the My VA dashboard. That's because the VAOS tool did not exist when the original My VA was created. Now that we have the VAOS tool, we can pull this data in directly through that integration. Please work with the **VAOS team** if you have questions on how to integrate with that data and pull it into the My VA dashboard.

*UX specs*

- **Next appointment** should show the next upcoming appointment based on chronological date and time.
- “You have **[X] upcoming appointments.” should show the total number of upcoming appointments that are scheduled in the VAOS tool.
- **View all appointments** links into [the VAOS tool](https://www.va.gov/health-care/schedule-view-va-appointments/appointments/).

Facility/location types (these should all be pulled in dynamically from the VAOS tool):

- VA (includes facility name)
- VA Video connect
- Phone
- Express care request

*Visual specs*

- The biggest challenge here may be the columns. We don't have many examples of handling information in columns like this on VA.gov, but we've reviewed this with some of the design leads and they agree that this treatment makes sense given that it improves scannability ove the existing single-column treatment.
