![Health care section example](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/frontend/images/Health%20care%20section%20example.jpg)

## When to show the health care section

**Show**

- Someone is enrolled in VA health care.

**Do not show**

- Someone is NOT enrolled in VA health care.

**Error state: We can't connect to the health care endpoint**

If we can not detect whether someone has health care or not because we can't connect to the endpoint, we will show an error at the top of the page and not load th health care section.

## Next Appointment

### When to show the Next appointments block

**Show**

- Someone is enrolled in VA health care, even if they have no upcoming appointments. We will never **not** show appointments within the health care section.

### States
  
**State 1: User has an upcoming appointment**  

*Appointments data specs*

- Currently, we do **not** show appointments data on the My VA dashboard. That's because the VAOS tool did not exist when the original My VA was created. Now that we have the VAOS tool, we can pull this data in directly through that integration. Please work with the **VAOS team** if you have questions on how to integrate with that data and pull it into the My VA dashboard.

*UX specs*

- **Next appointment** should show the next upcoming appointment based on chronological date and time.
- **Schedule and view your appointments** links into [the VAOS tool](https://www.va.gov/health-care/schedule-view-va-appointments/appointments/).

Facility/location types (these should all be pulled in dynamically from the VAOS tool):

- VA (includes facility name)
- VA Video connect
- Phone
- Express care request

*Visual specs*

*Copy specs*

**State 2: No upcoming appointments**  

![No upcoming appointments](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/frontend/images/Health%20care%20section_no%20upcoming%20appointment.jpg)

**Error state: We can't connect to the appointments endpoint**

In the event that we can not connect to the appointments endpoint to detect whether someone has upcoming appointments or not, we will show an error like so. **Final copy still TBD**.

## Messages

### When to show the messages link

**Show**

- Always show the messaging link.

### States
  
**State 1: User has unread messages**  

*Messages data specs*

- We have all of this data already showing on the existing My VA dashboard. It all comes through MyHealtheVet, but I don't know that we have a team to work with if we have questions about what data we have now or how this is currently set up. Please let us know ASAP if you have any concerns about the way we are handling data or how it's displayed.

*UX specs*

- This link only shows NEW/unread messages.
- “You have **[X] unread messages**” shows the total number of new/unread messages. This links into the [messaging tool in MyHealtheVet](https://sqa.eauth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/web/myhealthevet/secure-messaging).
  - **Note**: This is the staging link. We need to confirm the link for production.

*Visual specs*

- The link style **is** an existing element, but I think it may also only exist on the [Pittsburgh VA medical center site](https://www.va.gov/pittsburgh-health-care/).

*Copy specs*

[Copy documentation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/frontend/documentation/my-va-copy.md)

![Multiple new messages](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/frontend/images/Health%20care%20section_multiple%20new%20messages.jpg)

**State 2: No new message**  

- If a user has no unread messages, we will show a link that says “You have **[X] unread messages**”. This links into the [messaging tool in MyHealtheVet](https://sqa.eauth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/web/myhealthevet/secure-messaging).
  - **Note**: This is the staging link. We need to confirm the link for production.
- If a user has 0 unread messages, we should **not** bold the link like we do when the user has unread messages.

![No new messages](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/frontend/images/Health%20care%20section_no%20new%20messages.jpg)

**Error state: We can't connect to the messaging endpoint**

If we're having trouble connecting to the messaging endpoint, we will just show a link to messages that is not personalized, like so:

![Health care section_messages_error](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/frontend/images/Health%20care%20section_messages_error.jpg)

## Prescriptions

We are not showing customized prescription data at this time. If someone has health care, we will always show a **Refill and track your prescriptions** link that goes to [the prescription tool in MyHealtheVet](https://sqa.eauth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/web/myhealthevet/refill-prescriptions).
  - **Note**: This is the staging link. We need to confirm the link for production.

## Alerts/Errors

**Cerner alert**

If we detect someone manages appointments, messages, or prescriptions at a Cerner facility, they will see the following alert instead of the health care section.

![Health care section_Cerner alert](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/frontend/images/Health%20care%20section_Cerner%20alert.jpg)

**If we can't detect whether someone has health care because the endpoint is down**

TBD — waiting on design.
