# LOA1 dashboard

## InVision Mockups

- [Desktop](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/SH10HT8JCKYM#/screens/448032788)

**Note**: This mock shows the old design for the "Benefits you might be interested in" section, so please follow the latest design specs shown below.

## When to show the LOA1 state

**Show**

- A user signs in and is only LOA1.

## States

A user signs in and is LOA1. They should see:

- A prompt to verify their identity.
- The Apply for Benefits section.
  - **Note**: For this section, we do not need to attempt logic to tell whether they have any benefits or not, since we won't have access to that info for LOA1 users.
