### Feedback & Outcomes

#### Second Presentation to Samara:
Meeting date: 10/14/2020  
Attendees: Samara, Ryan, Tressa, Cassandra

#### Outcomes
- Remove breadcrumb
- Try mocking up a version with My VA in a tabbed treatment
- Try a blue or different color than grey to add contrast on tab
- Appointments: look at date formatting, square edges on cards to look less like a button, add appointment type, date, phone number
- Ryan liked that we are trying different solutions for mobile instead of just stacking for example only showing two cards for appointments on mobile vs. 3 cards on desktop
- Has questions around overview section and table padding with regard to responsive on tablet
