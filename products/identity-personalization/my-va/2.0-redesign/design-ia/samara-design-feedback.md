# Samara's design feedback

## Feedback 10.15.20

**Name tag**

We already discussed both of these:

- Move link to profile back to the side nav.
- Continue to iterate on color treatment, since white text on this shade of blue does not pass accessibility standards.

**Health care overview**

- Not that I want us to waste space, but this feels a little too close to the name tag area. I think we need a little more white space between them.

**Lab and test results**

- Can you move this below Secure messages?
- This section is still not working at all. What else can we do here? Could we have a "You might also be interested in" section at the bottom of the page for links? Do we move this below secure messages and add some detail copy (heading > copy > CTA) to make this feel less weird? What else can you do with this link/CTA so it doesn't feel so random?

**General**

- Can we remove the divider lines between each section? I think we can just have the right amount of white space between sections to differentiate between them.


## Feedback 10.14.20 -- Afternoon feedback

**Name tag**

- I really like the name tag in blue! Would love to also see an iteration without the tab and with the bread crumbs either in the name tag or below the name tag above the side navigation. We should have this in our back pocket depending on who makes final calls about updates to the navigation.

**Learn more about VA health benefits**

- I liked when this was on the same line as enrollment date. Can you move it back to that line but right align it to the opposite margin instead of having it left aligned under enrollment date? Let me know if this doesn't work for whatever reason. I realize it will all be stacked on mobile anyway, but that link can easily move responsively.

**Appointments**

- Can we rename this "Upcoming appointments"? Also, if we do that, we can remove the word "upcoming" in "disaplaying X upcoming appointments."
- Also, can we change the CTA to "View all appointments"? That will clue in the user that there is more than what is listed in the event that they have many appointments already scheduled.

**Prescriptions**

- Can we rename this section "Prescription refills"?
- "Active" is inside lingo on our end, so we should remove that word from "active prescriptions".
- Can we change the CTA to "View all prescriptions"?

**Secure messages**

- Did y'all confirm we can actually detect which messages are new? Sorry if you already have, but I don't remember getting clarification on that. We should confirm (if you haven't already) before showing the word "new" there. Also, if you can detect and show what is "new", please use a lowercase "n" in the word.
- Can we change the CTA to "View all messages"?

**General**

- For the table headings, can you remove the colon: after each header label?

## Feedback 10.14.20 -- Morning feedback

**Name tag**

This is all same as yesterday.

- Why do you have "VA appointment" under the "Appointments" heading? This feels redundant. What happened to the facility OR doctor name?
- Also, maybe "Appointments" should be "Next Appointment" since there is only one appointment there.
- Do we show data in XX/XX/XXXX format, or is always written out in words? This is something to check with content (and if we just have too much info to put in this block, we can revisit it altogether).

**Health care header**

Same as yesterday.

- Can you right align "Learn more about your VA health benefits"?

**Appointments**

- I really like this treatment.
- Same question about date — per the content style guide, I would check in with Peggy or someone about acceptable formats if you have not already. We need to make sure XX/XX/XXXX is acceptable and that it does not need to be written out in words.


**Lab and test results**

Same as yesterday.

- This treatment still doesn't work. What else can you do? Create a heading-copy-button section for lab and test results? Add a link to View lab and test results in the health care header area? Something else? 

**General**

- I REALLY like the header row for the tables. It's so much cleaner. However, then it's weird to have the header row be gray and then one of the rows in the table be gray. It makes the header/the row feel related, and obviously they aren't. I would probably just not have the second row of the table be gray.
- Please confirm with Erik and Sandra that we can actually show "Showing 1 -3 of X." Also, you need to be careful about that because it could be confusing. For example, is it 1 - 3 of 5 active prescriptions being refilled? Or is 5 all prescriptions? Is 1 - 3 of 5 all secure messages, or only new secure messages? Same with appointments — are those upcoming, does that include canceled/pending, etc. It might be easier to leave that out and to use more descriptive headings instead. "Upcoming appointments" and "Prescription refills" might be clearer for those two categories; "Secure messages" is probably clear as-is.

**Name tag**

- Why do you have "VA appointment" under the "Appointments" heading? This feels redundant. What happened to the facility OR doctor name?
- Also, maybe "Appointments" should be "Next Appointment" since there is only one appointment there.
- Do we show data in XX/XX/XXXX format, or is always written out in words? This is something to check with content (and if we just have too much info to put in this block, we can revisit it altogether).

**Prescriptions**

- This is not a big deal, but there is an erroneous question mark in the first prescription right before "Submitted."

## Feedback 10.9.20

**General**

- This is really coming together! I love the name tag area in the dark gray. It makes the page so much stronger.

**Nav**

- I love the nav. I think, for now, it might be OK to leave it like this without further incorporating profile info. We can just link off to profile like you have shown.

**Health care overview section**

- Cassandra had mocked up a version of this with the health care icon from the homepage, the health care heading, enrolled date, and "learn more about your benefits." Can you add that version of the overview section into the mockup? 

**Appointment**

- I think the stacked version of appointment info looks much more natural. 
- One suggestion: Can we maybe put those into a gray block or something (one for each appointment)? The info looks like it's floating in the middle of nowhere right now.
- Can I see a version where each appointment field is not labeled? That may mean adjusting the placement of the data points. I just want to see this and if we hate it, we can scrap it.

**Lab & test results**

- This feels like it's broken (because no additional data is shown) and like it's floating in the middle of nowhere. I'm not sure exactly what to do with this, but feel free to play around with some ideas. You may end up not treating this like the heading --> CTA pattern that we're using in other sections.

## Feedback 10.8.20

**General**

- Don't forget to add "My VA" back into the main nav!!
- My VA has a breadcrumb (you can check how we handle that in staging), so you'll want to add that back into this page.

**Name tag**

- Since this page will now have a breadcrumb and therefore whitespace between the name tag and navigation, I think we should make the nametag area dark gray again. It pops more and looks more refined/finished.

**Health care overview**

- This looks so good. I love it!!

**Appointments**

- This was mentioned in the platform team meeting, but please replace the CTAs here with "View all appointments." However, if there are no appointments I think the CTA should remain "Schedule an appointment." That should be no problem for Erik and Sandra to handle conditionally.
- I realize we talked a ton about tables in the platform team meeting, but could I see a treatment here where the appointment data appears stacked and not across a row? To me, it would be much more natural to view appointment information that way. I realize I'm not the user, and we should validate everything, but I would love to at least see how you might handle this in a mockup.

## Feedback 10.7.20

**Overview area**

*Enrolled view*

- Thank you for removing the information I asked you to remove. 
- I think you can handle this area more elegantly. You're repeating a lot of information. With the large "Health care" heading, "Your VA Health Care" and "You are enrolled in VA health care" become redundant. By this section being there, the user knows they are enrolled in VA health care. How can you clean up this section? This pattern does not need to be reused for people whose applications are incomplete, rejected, or closed or people who haven't applied.

*Not enrolled*

- This feels like the information is floating out in the middle of nowhere. I realize this changes some things in the data spreadsheet, but this is how I think we should handle this section:
  - If a peron has not applied, **do not show this section**. We can include messaging on how to apply elsewhere on the page.
  - If a user has applied but their application is either incomplete, rejected, or closed, we **should** show this section with that application status.
  
**Appointments**

- I'd like to see how you would handle multiple appointments.

## Feedback 10.6.20

### Section: Health care

First, things look GREAT so far. I'm so excited to see this work, and I think it's off to a great start. Overall, I LOVE how streamlined everything looks. It is a way more efficient presentation than what we have on My VA. You both should be so proud!!

**Overview area**

Overall, I'd like to simplify this section and have it take up less real estate. Here are some thoughts that might get us there:

- I thought we had talked about **not** including preferred facility for now. We are currently pulling it from the HCA, which often has out-of-date information since it does not account for facility updates that happened after someone filled out the health care application. We **are** going to eventually have preferred facilities in the VA.gov profile, but we don't yet, so I'm inclined to say take it out and we can figure out how to handle that data later.
- I am questioning whether we need "applied on" date for people who have enrolled. I know I told you to keep that from the My VA dashboard, but on second thought, it doesn't seem very helpful for people who are already in the health care program. However, I do want to keep the date someone enrolled on. 
- I also think we can remove the "find your nearest facility" link since the Facility Locator tool is very prominently placed in the main navigation.

So, with those suggestions, that would leave us with this section including:
- Someone is enrolled in VA healthcare since X date.
- A link to more info on VA health benefits.

As a result, this overview area might look a little different than the other cards, or not be a card at all, and I think that's OK.

**Appointments**

- What happens if someone has more than one appointment, or too many to list on this page?
- Why did you choose "view previous appointments" as the secondary CTA? Why not "Schedule an appointment"? 
- On that note, we **do** need a "Schedule an appointment" CTA, and I personally think that's more important than viewing previous appointments, but we can discuss.
- I realize you haven't worked with copy yet, but the code can accomodate singular/plural instances for the status of "You have one new appointment" or "You have two new appointments."
- For time, do we need to show timezone? If you haven't already, could you confirm how the data is shown in VAOS? Feel free to ignore if you already have checked.

**Prescriptions**

- I love how succinct this block is!
- Don't forget you need to show the submission date if a prescription has not yet been filled.
- What happens if a medication has a really long name?
- Probably an accident, but the "View your prescriptions" button should be aligned with the prescription names.

**Lab and test results**

- Let's leave this as-is for now. Depending on other changes to this page, I could see us changing how we treat this area, but I think we can adapt based on what we need to do with the other more critical content.

**Secure messages**

- Did you talk to Erik/Sandra about if there is a way to indicate which messages are new or not? We should confirm if we can show that.
- If we **can** determine which messages are new, we should determine whether unread messages should look different. I don't have a strong opinion on that, just something to think about.

**Other visual design feedback**

I really, really appreciate that you focused on the layout and interaction aspects of this section, and all of this was exactly what I expected to see. However, now that the meat is mostly here, I do think there are some opportunities to add a little more visual interest. None of this is mandatory, just suggestions to consider:

- On the logged-out homepage and on all the benefit landing pages, we have icons for all the major benefit categories. Can/Should those be incorporated here? 
- The status-y messages on this page, eg. "You have 1 new appointment", "You have 3 active prescriptions," etc, look like headings right now. Could we style them information in a way that calls them out a little bit more? I think this could be a place where we have a little fun a bring the design system forward.

Please feel free to hold off on these kind of details until you're ready for them. No rush, but wanted to make sure you had these thoughts for when you're ready to consider this level of detail.
