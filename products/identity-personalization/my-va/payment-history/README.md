## Overview
>Throughout [My VA 2.0 research and discovery](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research) in 2020 - 2021, the recurring theme mentioned by veterans is that seeing payment info on their My VA dashboard is a high priority.  The importance of payment information is also reflected in analytics, as viewing payments is a top interaction on VA.gov overall and is a top search term from the My VA dashboard. 
>- People have mentioned that seeing payment info on their My VA dashboard is a high priority since our [initial dashboard discovery in 2020](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md#for-those-interested-in-education-benefits-gi-bill-balance-and-payment-information-was-most-important)
>- Again in later research sessions, including during [December 2020 exploration research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/product/Research/MyVA-research-findings.md#additional-insights)
>- [March 2021 usability testing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/product/Research%20V2/MyVA2-research-findings.md#features-users-expected-to-see-that-were-missing)
>- [July 2021 notifications discovery](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md#for-those-interested-in-education-benefits-gi-bill-balance-and-payment-information-was-most-important)
>- The importance of payment information also bears out in analytics. Viewing payments is [a top interaction on VA.gov overall](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/report/content-event-events/a50123418w177519031p184624291/_u.date00=20201122&_u.date01=20211121&explorer-table.plotKeys=%5B%5D&explorer-table.rowCount=50&_r.drilldown=analytics.eventCategory:Interactions/)
>- "Payments" is  [a top search from the My VA dashboard](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/product/post-2.0-redesign-analytics.md#searches)
> 
>This effort aims to add payment information to the My VA dashboard to be elevated for logged-in veteran's awareness and attention, as the MVP.

## Problem
> *The pain point to resolve is that veterans expect to have their personalized financial information available on the My VA dashboard, without having to search VA.gov for it.* 
- *What is the problem and who is affected?*
     * Logged-in veterans have to perform a search or access the homepage to find links to their compensation and/or debt information
- *And, what evidence do we have of the problem?* 
     * The terms “payment”, “debt”, “travel pay” and “direct deposit” (and variations of those terms) make up half of the top 20 search terms generated from My VA 
     * The same terms make up 4 of the top 20 search terms on VA.gov overall
- *Why do you think the problem is occurring?*
     * Once veterans log in to My VA, there is no quick, intuitive way to easily view their payments, debts and perform financial actions 
- *Other reasons why this might be occurring?* 
     * Veterans may have difficulty finding the appropriate links to access their financial information
- *How does this initiative help further OCTO-DE's mission and goals?*
    * Increase the usage of My VA to become a one-stop shop for users’ benefit-related action items and status
    * Become a place where users can complete quick tasks related to their benefits

## User Outcomes

### Desired User Outcomes
- *Why would a user want to use this?*
    * This additional section will further support My VA dashboard as a "one-stop shop" for information that is a priority to veterans
    * Actionable links will allow the veteran to access more financial details and perform appropriate actions as needed
- *With this problem solved, what should users be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*
    * With this problem solved, Veterans will more quickly view their payment and debt information, instead of having to perform searches on the site
    * With this problem solved, Veterans will more easily be able to access payment history or view outstanding debts, which may result in quicker task completion
    * With this problem solved, Veterans may be able to more fully engage with the VA

### Undesired User Outcomes
- We do not want this section to cause confusion or add to their cognitive load.  It should be informative and usable
- We do not want the My VA page to become too cluttered or cumbersome, slowing down veterans, instead of expediting their experience
 
## Business Outcomes

### Desired Business Outcomes

- *Why would your business want this to exist?*
    * The addition of a payment information section should help fulfill our north star objective of moving toward My VA being the one-stop shop for action items and benefit status, so that it provides more direct, personalized routes to veterans’ most critical updates and tasks

- *With this problem solved, what should your business be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*
    * Provide veterans with a personalized go-to source for payment and debt information
    * Provide veterans with links to related action items, such as viewing outstanding debts, payment history, direct deposit or travel reimbursement
    * Reduce the number of payment or debt related searches


### Undesired Business Outcomes
- We do not want the My VA page to become cumbersome and unusable
- We do not want the payment information section to display irrelevant or incorrect information

## Measuring Success
- NOT YET FINALIZED

### Looking ahead to Q1 2022 - These OKR/KPIs are potential suggestions only

- **Objective: Add a Payments Information section, so that the veteran has access to view and take action on payments and/or debts**

- **Key result #1**: Interaction: Increase overall clicks into payment history, debt information, travel reimbursement, and direct deposit CTAs.

|KPI/metric|Baseline: Aug-Nov 2021|Post-launch: Qx 2022| Post-launch: Qx 2022|
|----------|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
|Clicks to view all payments ("View all payments"))| 2.3mil|TBD|TBD|
|Clicks to view all debts ("You have n oustanding debt payments")| 179k|TBD|TBD|
|Clicks to view travel reimbursement ("Request travel reimbursement")| 249k|TBD|TBD|
|Clicks to view direct deposit settings ("Manage direct deposit")| 464k|TBD|TBD|



- **Key result #2**: Findability: Reduce search incidents for payment, debt, direct deposit or travel reimbursement.  These terms should not be in the top 20 search terms for searches generate from My VA. 
- *SUGGESTION: Consider a metric that is optimized by this change, rather than not.  Look for something that has no ceiling, rather than this that has a definite floor (zero).*

[My VA Search Report: Aug – November 2021](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/report/content-site-search-pages/a50123418w177519031p176188361/_u.date00=20210801&_u.date01=20211130&explorer-table.plotKeys=%5B%5D&explorer-table.rowCount=50&_r.drilldown=analytics.searchStartPage:www.va.gov~2Fmy-va~2F/)

|KPI/metric|Baseline: Aug-Nov 2021|Post-launch: Qx 2022| Post-launch: Qx 2022|
|----------|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
|Search rank for "payment” or "payment history" from My VA| #1, #10, #11|TBD|TBD|
|Search rank for "debt” or "debt management" from My VA| #3, #20|TBD|TBD|
|Search rank for "direct deposit” from My VA| #2, #6|TBD|TBD|
|Search rank for "travel pay” or "travel reimbursement" from My VA| #8, #17, #18|TBD|TBD|

This may also have an impact on [overall searches on VA.gov for logged in users](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/?authuser=0#/report/content-site-search-search-terms/a50123418w177519031p184624291/&explorer-table.plotKeys=%5B%5D&explorer-table.rowCount=25&_.useg=user8twPUpCZT8qMEc9RwdXoUg/).

|KPI/metric|Baseline: Aug-Nov 2021|Post-launch: Qx 2022| Post-launch: Qx 2022|
|----------|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
|Search rank for "payment” or "payment history" from My VA| #6|TBD|TBD|
|Search rank for "debt” or "debt management" from My VA| #23|TBD|TBD|
|Search rank for "direct deposit” from My VA| #7, #17|TBD|TBD|
|Search rank for "travel pay” or "travel reimbursement" from My VA| #9|TBD|TBD|

- **Key result #3**: Usage: Increase % of logged-in users visiting My VA from 8% in Q4 to n% post-launch by end of Q1.

## Discovery
### Assumptions/Risks
> *Identify risks related to usability, value to users, feasibility/implementation, and viability given organizational constraints<sup>2</sup>. 
> Indicate how you'll validate/test against these risks.*

- **Value Risks** (will people use it): 
  - Risk: Accuracy of the financial information displayed.  If incorrect information is displayed, it can damage the trust between the veteran and VA.gov. 
    - This can be mitigated by connecting directly to the payment/debt backend DBs to pull the correct data
- **Usability Risks** (can people figure out how to use it):
  - Risk: Potential confusion on where the links may direct the veteran
  - Risk: Potential confusion or degrading user experience when links direct to a page outside of My VA
    - This section will function the same as other sections already existing on My VA for a consistent experience.
- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data):
  - Risk: Dependency on payment and debt database availability
    - Payment and debt information is currently available within VA.gov, and can easily be accessed by My VA for display 
- **Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact):
  - A constraint to consider is to complete full testing of the new section, with a phased production release while measuring against OKR/KPIs. Only successful results will trigger the next roll-out phase.

### Prioritization
> *Describe how the team will consider competing solution hypotheses/ideas. Prioritize them accounting for reach, impact/value, effort, and confidence.*
  - There is a question on whether we should display specific details on the last payment amount made to the veteran OR specific details on the outstanding debt.  
    - We will be conducting usability testing to determine the most effective and useful information to display to veterans.
  - Our research shows that direct deposit management and travel reimbursement are other top financial related searches, and we intend to include a link to manage each of them.  

### Solution Summary
> *What's in scope for you to build with this initiative? Describe key features/flows. What have you explicitly decided to **not** include and why?*
