# Outstanding Debts Frontend Documentation
Last updated: December 8, 2023 - updated url for "Manage your VA debt"

### Background
This is FE documentation for v2 of "payment info" on My VA in which the original single section My VA, "Benefit payments and debts" was separated out into two sections - one for Outstanding Debts and a second for Benefit Payments. This document specifically covers the Outstanding Debts section on My VA.

## When to show the ‘Outstanding debts’ section
We show this section for every LOA3 user.

**Content sources**

- Number of overpayment debts is pulled from [combined debt portal](https://www.va.gov/manage-va-debt/your-debt) - does not include copays. This should be plural if there is more than one debt; singular if there is only one.

- Last updated date should be the most recent date that any overpayment debt has been updated in [combined debt portal](https://www.va.gov/manage-va-debt/your-debt) - does not include copays.

#### **Visual specs**

Use the [card component](https://design.va.gov/components/card) in the VA design system for the debt card.

The link style on the card is the [active link style](https://design.va.gov/storybook/?path=/docs/components-va-link--default#active) in the VA design system.

Updated on [date]

[Manage your VA bills](https://www.va.gov/manage-va-debt/summary/copay-balances)

**Content sources**

- Number of copay bills is pulled from [combined debt portal copay balances page](https://www.va.gov/manage-va-debt/summary/copay-balances) and is the total number of statements that the user has. The user will have one statement per facility that they have any outstanding copays for. This should be plural if there is more than one copay statement; singular if there is only one.

- Last updated date should be the most recent date that any copay statement has been updated on the [copay balances page](https://www.va.gov/manage-va-debt/summary/copay-balances).

#### **Visual specs**

Use the [card component](https://design.va.gov/components/card) in the VA design system for the copay card.

The link style on the card is the [active link style](https://design.va.gov/storybook/?path=/docs/components-va-link--default#active) in the VA design system.

### If a user has overpayment debt(s) AND copay bill(s)

- Show both cards and always show the debts card first, then the copays card. On desktop, the cards should be side by side. On mobile they should stack with copays on the bottom.
