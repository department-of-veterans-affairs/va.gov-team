We show this section if a veteran has ever received payments or has any outstanding debt.

**Show**

- If we receive any information from the debts API, and the debt is not 0.

**Do NOT show**
- If we don't receive any information from the payment history API *AND*
- If we don't receive any information from the debts API *or*
- We receive information from the debts API, and the debt equals 0.
