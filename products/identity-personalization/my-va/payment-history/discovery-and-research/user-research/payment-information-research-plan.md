# Research Plan for Authenticated Experience team, Payment information and onsite notifications, January 2022

## Background

Throughout [My VA 2.0 research and discovery](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research) in 2020 - 2021, the recurring theme mentioned by Veterans is that seeing payment info on their My VA dashboard is a high priority. The importance of payment information is also reflected in analytics, as viewing payments is a top interaction on VA.gov overall and is a top search term from the My VA dashboard.

This effort aims to add payment information to the My VA dashboard to be elevated for logged-in Veteran's awareness and attention, as the MVP.

### OCTO Objectives

The addition of a payment information section should help fulfill our north star objective of moving toward My VA being the one-stop shop for action items and benefit status, so that it provides more direct, personalized routes to Veterans’ most critical updates and tasks

### Veteran Journey

Since Veterans can incur debt any time after establishing benefits with VA, this work impacts the Veteran journey from Starting Up and beyond.

## Research Goals

### 1. Validate that our proposed payment information IA matches the Veteran mental model.

- Where do users expect to see new information about their payments and debts on [VA.gov](http://va.gov/)?
- Can users find the payment information that they're looking for?
- Do users expect to see a travel reimbursement link under health care or payment information?
- What is the order of importance of the existing sections on My VA + payment information?
- How do users expect their action items to be structured in relation to non-action item information? (in sections, or all at the top together, or something else?)

### 2. Understand the financial information that is most important to Veterans.

- What information do users want to know about new debts, existing debts, and payments from the VA?
  
  - Is it important for them to know how many new debts have been added, or only that they have new debt?
- Are we missing any additional links?
  
- How long do users expect to have access to historical financial information (debts + payments) on My VA?
  
- Does providing a link allow users take sufficiently take action on their payments and debts, and manage direct deposit?
  

### **3. Validate that our onsite notification MVP meets Veterans' needs.**

- Does the proposed MVP solution (a single dismissible debt notification displayed at the top of the page) help Veterans to more easily take action on their payments or debts?
  - Why would a user want to dismiss this alert?
  - What do users expect to happen after an alert has been dismissed? How and when would they see that information again?
  - Are there any areas where the design does not meet Veteran needs?
- When does a user expect to see an alert about new debt?

### Outcome

We'll use the findings from this research to update our page IA and inform our MVP designs.

### Hypothesis

- We believe Veterans will be able to more easily manage their debts using the links in My VA.
- We believe Veterans will be able understand their payment history more quickly by reviewing the information we're surfacing on My VA.
- We believe Veterans will want to see more details about the financial information, and that providing a link from My VA will be a sufficient way for them to get those details.
- We believe the design for action items and alerts will be effective at drawing attention to important information.
- We believe there may be some confusion about why some alerts are at the top of the page, and others are within distinct sections of My VA.

## Method

We'll conduct remote usability testing over Zoom using a prototype on production. Testing on production allows us to use a code-based prototype and be more inclusive with our recruiting approach. We will pause the recording once we have users log in to avoid capturing PII.

In the event that for some reason we can't test on production, we will use a prototype. We will also use the prototype to complete task 3 with participants who do not have debt.

## Recruitment

### Recruitment approach

We will recruit Veteran participants using a lean maximum variation strategy. We'll leverage Perigean's recruiting services to find our participants.

### Recruitment criteria

Schedule 16 Veterans for a minimum of 8 successfully completed sessions.

#### **Primary criteria (must-haves)**

- All participants must be LOA3 (identity verified) on VA.gov. **Participants will likely not know what this means, so please confirm this prior to testing.** This can be confirmed by having users sign into VA.gov with any of their credentials and having them go to the VA.gov profile. If they are prompted to verify their identity, that means they are LOA1 and they are not suitable for testing. If they can see any sections in profile **other than Account Security**, they are LOA3 and can participate in testing.
  
- All participants must be comfortable providing the email address they use to sign into VA.gov. We need this information 2-3 days before the study begins in order to give participants access to the prototype in production.
  
- All participants should have received education benefit or compensation/pension payments from the VA. Screener question:
  
  - Have you ever received an education, compensation, or pension payment from the VA?
    
  - Answering yes would qualify the participant for the study.
    
- At least 50% of participants should have incurred education (CH 33, CH 34, CH 35) or compensation/pension debts. Screener questions:
  
  1. Do you have education, compensation, or pension debt with VA?
  2. Do you have health care related debt with VA?
  
  - Answering yes to question **1 AND 2** would qualify the participant for the study.
  - Answering yes **only to question 2** would disqualify the participant from the study.
- 50% participants should have health care with VA, either now or in the past. Screener question:
  
  - Do you currently or have you ever received health care through VA?
  - Answer should be yes to qualify for the study.
- All participants must able to screenshare via Zoom. Please confirm with them that they have Zoom downloaded prior to the session and they know how to screenshare. If they can not get Zoom working, there is no interview portion of this research and they will not be able to participate.
  
  - Participants should be understand that facilitators and observers will be able to see their VA account information, and be comfortable with this.
- 50% of participants should be able to participant from a desktop device.
  
- 50% of participants should be able to participate from a non-desktop device (tablet or mobile phone).
  

#### **Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**

##### Gender

- 8 women, 8 men

##### Inclusion

- 3 participants who use assistive technology (e.g. screen reader, magnification)
- 10 participants who identify as other than white
- 5 participants who identify as other than straight/heterosexual and cisgender
- 8 participants age 55+
- 8 participants who identify as having a cognitive disability
- 5 participants who do not have a college degree
- 5 participants who live in a rural area

##### Geography

- 6 participants from the east coast
- 5 participants from the mid-west
- 5 participants from the west coast
