## Introduction
This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions.

### Document goal
* To compare research hypotheses to outcomes
* To summarize full research synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

## Findings
### Our Hypothesis

**1. Users will be able to clearly see and read the notification at the top of the page and will know how to act on it if they wished to see more details or resolve a debt.**
- Mostly true.
- All users noticed the notification right away.
- 2 out of 8 users had some trouble reading the date text without zooming in.
- All users understood the content of the notification.
- All users knew how to take action on the debt notification and/or find out more information about it.
- 7 out of 8 users did not realize they needed to dismiss the notification in order for it to disappear. They expected it to go away on its own once the debt was paid.

	> The notifications should always be there. I’m expecting a notifications page. - P8

	> [If I paid the debt and the notification was still there] My anxiety level would go through the roof. It makes me want to drive to the VA and see what’s going on. Once I pay the debt, I would expect it to go away. - P5

**2. Veterans will find the debt information useful and will be able to determine a path to resolve debts that are due from My VA.**
- Mostly true.
- All veterans said they would rather manage their debt on VA.gov than through the mail and over the phone, and they would find the debt information on My VA useful.
- The most important information about debts varied but had some repeated repsonses:
	- How they accrued the debt (4)
	- Payment options (3)
	- Dollar amount due (2)
	- Dates the services were rendered/debt accrued (1)
- All users knew that they could click on Manage my VA debt or Manage my VA bills to find out more information and take whatever step they wanted to take next.

	> I would have liked to be notified with an email or notification for my debt. I only log on VA.gov a few times a year. An electronic form of communication including the letter. I check my email every day. - P12

**3. Veterans will be able to tell the difference between amounts that are due and amounts that have been paid to them on My VA.**
 - Definitely true.
 - 7 out of 8 veterans said it was clear that the outstanding debts amounts were due to the VA and the benefit payments amounts had been paid to them.
 - 2 out of 8 veterans expressed confusion about whether the debt amount was an amount that would be due every month or a total amount of all debt.
 
 	> 'Outstanding debts' is what you need to pay the VA. Maybe it’s things that you need to pay or didn’t do. ‘Benefit payments’ I would assume is your monthly benefit payment, education, or anything else you can get from the VA. - P4

 	> I'm confused if it's a one-time amount or a monthly payment. - P5

**4. Surfacing more details about debts and payments is important to Veterans and is something they would want to see upon logging into the site.**
- Definitely true.
- All veterans that we tested with who had debt previously (7 out of 8) received information about it in the mail and paid it through the mail or over the phone. They all said they would have preferred electronic communication and to manage and pay it online.
- Most veterans expressed frustration with having to hunt down important details and different ways to pay their debt.

 	> I would have liked to do all of this online than having to call because it’s usually a long wait. - P3

 	> Once the letter comes in the mail, it's almost too late. - P5

 	> I had to call them to get information on how much. There was no platform for me to manage my debt. This was a while ago. I received a letter in the mail that was delayed about a year. I didn’t know how much I needed to pay and timing. - P10

**5. There may be some confusion around whether copays should fall under debts or belong under a healthcare-related section because feedback on this topic has been split fairly even so far.**
- Somewhat true.
- 2 out of 8 users said they thought copays should belong under health care.
- 4 out of 8 users said copays made sense to be under debts. The others did not comment on copays.
- Of the users who said they have medical copays, all said it made sense to see them under outstanding debts.

 	> [When asked about the outstanding debts section title] I would assume ‘Outstanding debts’ would include co-payments. I guess it would show a breakdown of the debts. - P3

### Research questions
**1. Is the redesigned notification style clear and actionable?**
- For the most part, yes.
- The content, visibility, and actionability of the notification had overall very positive feedback.
- Only 1 out of 8 veterans knew they would have to dismiss the notification themself for it to disappear.

**2. Do the titles of Outstanding Debts and Benefit Payments sections accurately convey the content?**
- Yes.
- Only 1 out of 8 veterans was confused by one of the titles and thought benefit payments might be something that will be paid in the future.
- All of the others (7 out of 8) defined the sections correctly without seeing any of the content.

**3. Are the details displayed the most important pieces of information for debts?**
- Somewhat.
- All of the details shown were important to veterans except for the last updated date.
- 3 out of 8 veterans said that date was useful to know but the rest were not sure exactly what it meant.
- All veterans found the dollar amounts, number of debts, and action link to be useful.
- 4 out of 8 veterans said the most important piece of information about a debt is what it's for.

	> That would be the end of their billing cycle. Any VA visits after the date, they wouldn’t show the debt yet. - P8

**4. Is the logical next step for debts effectively presented to the veteran and do they know how to take action on it?**
- Yes.
- 8 out of 8 veterans knew where they could go from My VA to take the next step, whether they said they would want to find out more information, seek payment options, verify accuracy, or request help.
- One of the colorblind users said it was helpful to have the Manage your VA debt link underlined so that he could tell he could click on it since the blue color wasn't totally clear to him.

**5. Are the most important pieces of payment information being presented on My VA?**
- Yes.
- Veterans said the payment section was "straightforward" and they did not have any confusion or questions about it.
- The only piece of information we are omitting from the current design is the last 4 digits of the direct deposit account.
	- 8 out of 8 veterans correctly identified where they could go to verify the account their payment was deposited to, but none expressed concern about that information being absent on My VA.


### Additional findings
**1. Veterans prefer to see more detailed information about debts on My VA rather than a total sum of all money owed to VA.**
- 8 out of 8 participants said they preferred to see the version of debts where we show separate amounts for debts and copays, rather than the version with one total amount of all money owed to VA.

	> If the debts aren’t medical, I think they should be separate. If it was an education debt, it should not be combined with your medical. You might budget for them differently. - P4

	> A debt is different than a co-pay bill. They would be different to manage. They are different expenses. - P10

**2. Red and green colors did make it clear what was due and what was paid to users, but we can't yet determine if they are necessary for scannability.**
- Several users commented on the colors making it clear what money was due and what was paid to them, but those same users correctly identified this distinction by the section titles alone before the content was revealed, and some commented on the parantheses and plus sign also making the difference between the two clear.
- 2 out of 8 users said that the red color of the debt amount was triggering anxiety.

	> Debts are in red and make me feel anxious. The payments in green make me feel calm. - P3

	> Red, there is a problem, green is good. - P10

**3. Veterans who have a preference on observers would like to be asked the day of the study if it’s okay to have them join. Most participants did not care either way and were comfortable.**
- We asked participants before letting observers enter the Zoom meeting. Once observers entered, they had their cameras on and names displayed, and waved and/or said a quick hello before shutting their cameras off to observe the session.
- 2 out of 8 users said they would prefer this approach over having observers in the room already wehn the session started. The rest said they did not care either way.

	> People like me with mental health stuff, the most frustrating thing about PTSD and stuff is that we never know what our mood is gonna be like. It’s really frustrating because there’s nothing we can really do about it. So…I could be totally fine about it one day and I could be totally offended the next day. It really depends and I think to keep it safe for everyone, you guys and the veteran, to maybe always ask first. - P3

## Recommendations and next steps
1. Continue to iterate on a notification design/pattern since veterans did not know they would need to dismiss it themselves.
2. Explore whether we would like to set a time limit on debt notifications so that they disappear on their own, since we cannot dismiss the notification based on when a debt has been paid.
3. Show debts and copays as two separate cards on My VA.
4. Additional research is needed to determine if debts will stand out enough without the use of red color when users are scanning the page. We should test this in UAT by eliminating the use of color for debts and payments.
5. Consider eliminating last updated date on debts or replacing it with more useful info like what type of debts they are.
6. Be prepared to intuitively skip through certain parts of testing for users who seem triggered by the subject matter (ex. debt).
7. Continue with new observer method asking participants if they are OK with observers before letting anyone in from waiting room.
