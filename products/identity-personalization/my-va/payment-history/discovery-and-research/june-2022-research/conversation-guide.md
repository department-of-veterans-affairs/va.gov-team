- _Check your screensharing setup and share permissions for participants._
- _When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro._

## Intro - 2 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Angela and I also have a note taker here with me. Today we're going to talk about a new feature on VA.gov that will help Veterans get their recent details about VA payments and debts.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **I also have some other colleagues in the waiting room who would like to observe and take notes.** Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I wanted to be sure before we get going. Are you okay with letting them in for this session?
	- _If participant does not consent, ask the observers to kindly leave the Zoom via Slack._
	- _If participant consents, let other observers into room and allow a short pause to say hello._ Here are some other members from our website team - if you'd all like to say a quick hello. And now for those of you who just joined, if you could please turn off your cameras to save bandwidth, the would be great.
- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you any longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic to keep us on schedule.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability; we are testing our work so you cannot do anything wrong here. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. As you go through the site, it'll be really helpful if you can think out loud as much as possible.

- **You'll be interacting with a prototype.** This may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be interactive, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

**Task goal: Confirm they qualify for the study, learn how they receive information from VA about financial things, and how that's meeting their needs.**

Before we look at the website, I'd like to get a little background information from you:

1. First, tell me a little about yourself and your relationship to the VA.

2. As part of the scheduling for this session, we asked if you had either received payments from VA or incurred education, compensation, pension, or health care-related debt. Can you tell me how you got info from VA about updates on those payments or debts?
  
3. You mentioned that you receive updates on your payments or debts via *insert what the participant said*. What information about your payments and debts is included? Was that helpful? Was anything missing?
  
4. How do you manage your VA finances? Online, by mail, etc?

5. Let's talk about the website - how do you use VA.gov? *If they use it:* Do you ever visit My VA when you are logged in?
  
## First Task: Determine if the redesigned notification style is clear and actionable. - 5 minutes

**Task goal: Get feedback on the titles of the sections, whether they are clear what the content will be, and whether the titles resonate with terminology Veterans are familiar with.**

Now I'm going to ask you to open a prototype from a link I'll post in the chat and have you share your screen. Just a reminder - it'll be very helpful if you think out loud and share what's on your mind as much as possible as you're looking at the prototype.

- Send link to prototype in Zoom chat
- If user is on mobile, tell them to press the three dots that say "More" and then select Chat from the menu to access the link that was sent
- Ask participant to share their screen by selecting the green Share Screen button in the middle of the bottom menu

We will be looking at a prototype as a fictional logged in user, so the content may not apply directly to you, but I'd like to hear your thoughts on a scenario where we'll imagine that they do. We'll be looking at a prototype of My VA and talking about specific sections.

- So looking at just what you can see now without scrolling, what's jumping out to you?
- *(If they don't mention notifications)* Did you notice the "notifications" section here?
- Now taking a look at this notifications section, is everything visible to you? Is anything hard to read or decipher?
- Why do you think you might come to see a notification like this?
- What would you do next after having seen this notification?
- What would you do if you wanted more information about this debt?
- Let's say you clicked on Manage your VA debt, went and paid the debt that you had, and you came back to this page (My VA) and this notification was still here. What would you think about that and what would you do?

## Second Task: Determine if the title of this section accurately conveys the content. - 3 minutes

- Okay, now let's scroll down to the Outstanding Debts and Benefit Payments sections. Before we reveal the content of these sections, can you tell me what type of things you think you'd see here just based on the titles?

- What do you think "outstanding debts" refers to here? What about "benefit payments"?

- Okay, let's click once and we'll take a look at the content of these sections.

- Reveal the content of the section by clicking anywhere on the page

### Things to watch for:

- Do users mention any types of debt and/or copays when they're thinking of what debts might be?
- Do users understand that payments will be paid to them, or do they think they are paid to the VA?
- Are there any negative reactions to the titles?

## Third Task: Review and get feedback on details for debts - 8 minutes

**Task goal: Validate that the details displayed are the most important pieces of information for debts**.

- Let's take a look at the outstanding debts section. Can you describe to me what you think this section is for? What's standing out to you?

- How do you think you might come to have these showing in your account? 

*Listen to hear if they are noticing some are debts and some are copays or if they don't make that differentiation.*

- *If they did not mention anything about the copay* Did you notice that it says this is for both debts and copays? Would you expect to see copays in the same section as debts, or somewhere else on this page? 

- *If original combined version was shown first, then ask* Okay, let's click on the Outstanding Debts title to see a slightly different view. Here the copay total is listed under debts separately. Would you prefer to see the total for copays combined with debts, or as a separate amount? Why?

- *If alt version was shown first, then ask* Okay, let's click on the Outstanding Debts title to see a slightly different view. Here the debt total is shown as one amount instead of the debt and copays being separate like you just saw. Would you prefer to see the total for all debt owed here, or did you prefer seeing the total for debts and copays separately? Why?

- What do you think the last updated dates refer to?

- What's the most important piece of information you would want to know about a debt that you have, regardless of whether you see that info here?

- If you had these debts in your account, do you think you'd like to manage them from this website or some other way?

- Is there anything you expect to see here that you don't? Is anything about this section confusing to you?

*If user has colorblindness, ask:*
- Do you see the debt amounts in a different color than the other text? What color does it look like? Does the color differentiate this section from the next one at all? Is anything hard to see?

### Things to watch for:

- Do users understand why these amounts are due?
- What info is most prominent currently? Does that line up with what they say is the most important piece of information about debts?
- Do users notice that there are both copays and different types of debt in this section?
- Are veterans confused about why one debt has a status update instead of a due date?
- Is there any important information missing in this section?
- Do colorblind users struggle to see or interpret the dark red text?

## Fourth Task: Discuss action items in bills section - 5 minutes

**Task goal: Validate that the logical next step for debts is effectively presented to the Veteran and they know how to take action on it.**

- What do you think you'd want to do with this information?

- What would you do next if you wanted to pay or request help for your debt?

- What would you expect to see if you clicked the Manage your VA debt link?

- What would you expect to see if you clicked the Manage your VA bills link?

### Things to watch for:

- Do veterans know how to take action on debts that are due?
- What do veterans expect to happen if they click the one of the action links?
- Are the two different action links for managing VA debt and VA bills confusing or preferred?
- Is the action link standing out enough?

## Fifth Task: Discuss details in the payments section - 5 minutes

**Task goal: Validate that the most important pieces of payment information are being presented on My VA.**

- Let's take a look at the section called Benefit Payments. Can you describe to me what you think this section is for? What's standing out to you?

- Based on the titles of these line items, tell me how you think you would have come to have these showing in your account. 

- Would you know where these payments were deposited to? *If no* How would you go about finding out?

- What would you do if you wanted to see more than just your most recent payment?

- What's the most important piece of information you would want to know about your payments?

- Let's say you used to receive payments montly from the VA but now you don't anymore. How long do you think you'd want to see the most recent payment here?

- Is there anything you expect to see here that you don't? Is anything about this section confusing to you?

*If user has colorblindness, ask:*
- Do you see the payment amounts in a different color than the other text? What color does it look like? Does the color differentiate this section from the previous one at all? Is anything hard to see?

### Things to watch for:

- Is it clear that payments are made to them from the VA?
- Are there any important pieces of information missing?
- Is it unclear where the money was deposited to without the account number info?
- Is the action link standing out enough?

## Post Task Interview - 5 minutes

- Now that we've walked through this page a bit, let's talk about your thoughts on the overall experience.

1. How important is the information that we looked at today to you?
2. Is this something you would want to see as soon as you log in to VA, or something you might search out once in a while?
3. If you could change one thing about the section we just looked at together, what would it be?

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Great, thank you so much. This has been really helpful for our team, and we appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Do you have any questions or last thoughts for me before we end the session?

- Before we end this session, I have three additional questions for you about the study setup. I’ll ask the observers to leave the session at this time.
- _wait for observers to leave_
- Would you say that you were mostly nervous or mostly comfortable with having observers in this session?
- Sometimes we have the additional observers already in the session when you join, instead of how we did it today. When I asked you for consent before the observers joined this session, did you appreciate that, or did you feel that was mostly unnecessary?
- Thinking about the brief introductions with the observers, did that make you more feel at ease with them listening in, or did it feel more awkward?

Great, thank you for your feedback and thank you so much again for joining us today. We really appreciate it.
