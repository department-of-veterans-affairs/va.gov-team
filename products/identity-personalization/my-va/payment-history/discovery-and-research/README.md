## Overview

When Veterans log into VA.gov, [they expect to be met with an experience that reflects their personal circumstances at the VA](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md#participants-want-a-page-that-is-focused-on-current-information-specific-to-them-rather-than-generalized-information-for-all-veterans). In July 2021, we moved closer to this goal by launching the [redesigned version of the My VA dashboard](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign#readme). As part of this, we elevated information on disability, claims, health care, and applications in progress, but we left a few things out of the MVP to keep scope down. One of the high priority sections for users that we did not tackle was payment and financial information. People mentioned payment info as high priority in our [initial dashboard discovery in 2020](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md#for-those-interested-in-education-benefits-gi-bill-balance-and-payment-information-was-most-important), and again in [later research sessions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md#for-those-interested-in-education-benefits-gi-bill-balance-and-payment-information-was-most-important). "Payments" is also [a top search from the My VA dashboard](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/product/post-2.0-redesign-analytics.md#searches), and viewing payments is [a top interaction on VA.gov overall](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/report/content-event-events/a50123418w177519031p184624291/_u.date00=20201122&_u.date01=20211121&explorer-table.plotKeys=%5B%5D&explorer-table.rowCount=50&_r.drilldown=analytics.eventCategory:Interactions/). This effort aims to determine what a baseline would be for education information on the My VA dashboard.
