## Mar 4, 2022 | Medical Copays - Discovery Update
#### Attendees: Angela, Heather, Samara

### Notes
- Goal of this meeting is to talk about the discovery for Medical Copays so far
     - Angela provided an update 
          - the Debt Resolution team is working to combine debts and copays into the same debt portal - Tentative launch Early April
          - This will mean that the information will be in the same place, and we can provide one link on the My VA Page
          - We will want to coordinate with the Debt team on their usability testing and research
               - This may allow the user to walk through My VA, select the link, and access their debt/copay information - testing the user flow
               - Angela will set up a weekly touchpoint with Debt team to maintain coordination
          - We will omit any copays questions from our own UAT questions on the payment info section
          - We will need to consider potential copy changes to ensure the user knows what kind of information they can access
          - We will need to consider making these changes to delivere along with the Payment Info MVP - Depending on when the Debt team launches their combined portal effort.

#### Next Steps
- [ ] Angela will reach out to Debt team to set up a weekly touchpoint meeting
- [ ] Angela can begin on mock-ups of the Payment info section with suggested copy changes and layout
