## Mtg 3/10/22 with Debt Res team:
- Angela shared proposed design of link on My VA to include copays in Benefit payments and debts section (section renamed "Benefit payments, debts and copays")
     - Angela will reach out to Danielle on content of the proposed section title
- Riley shared proposed design of combined debt & copay portal
     - Once the debt and copays are combined, we will need to confirm the link to the Overview page URL that shows both debts and copays listed (if applicable to the user).
     - Will need to do tech discovery on this Overview page to see how to pull the number of debts and copays separately (they are listed as separate info blocks in the current design proposal - image below)

- Note: the term "Bill" was used across the board from Veterans during research of the documents presented with no prompting
