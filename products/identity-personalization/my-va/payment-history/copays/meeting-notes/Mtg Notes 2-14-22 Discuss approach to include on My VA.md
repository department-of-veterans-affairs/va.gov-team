## Feb 14, 2022 | Copays - Discuss approach to include on My VA
#### Attendees: Angela Agosto Heather Justice Liz Lantz samara.strauss@va.gov 

### Notes
- Goal of this meeting is to determine the effort
     - Not a full project
          - Full collab cycle may not but needed
          - Looking at a 1 month delivery - smaller effort
          - Heather will talk with Shira and submit CC kickoff 
               - May have a reduced CC engagement
- User research was split, but both sections were acceptable
- A/B test - health care vs BP&D? 
     - May reduce user/usability testing efforts
     - No formal ability to do AB testing, but could try it out
          - 1 week deploy to one section
          - Another week deploy to the other section
          - Discuss with Taylor on feasibility
          - Cannot test concurrently - no capability
     - UAT - Screenshot to share and gain feedback
          - Question added at the end of UAT
- Will need to consider where and how to display
     - Conditional display
     - Info currently resides under Health care
          - Does not need to live under Health care on My VA
     - Create some mockups on what this might look like?
          - Might a person be confused if copays and debts are in separate places?
          - What about multiple copays?
          - Will also need to think about what this looks like in a possible reorganization of My VA
