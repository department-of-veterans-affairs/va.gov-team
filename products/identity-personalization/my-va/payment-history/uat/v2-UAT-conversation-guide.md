## Intro - 2 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Angela and I'm a designer for VA. Today we're going to talk about a new feature on VA.gov that will help Veterans get their recent details about VA payments and debts.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **I also have some other colleagues in the waiting room who would like to observe and take notes.** Are you okay with letting them in for this session?
	- _If participant does not consent, ask the observers to kindly leave the Zoom via Slack._
	- _If participant consents, let other observers into room and allow a short pause to say hello._ Here are some other members from our website team - please go ahead and introduce yourselves.
	- _Observers introduce their name and role_
	- Thank you observers! Please turn off your cameras to save bandwidth.
- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you any longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic to keep us on schedule.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability; we are testing our work so you cannot say or do anything wrong here. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. As you go through the site, it'll be really helpful if you can think out loud as much as possible.

- **We will be looking at your real account info in VA.gov today.** This means we will be able to see some of your personal information which may include benefit payments and debt information. If at any point you are uncomfortable, feel free to stop sharing your screen.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

**Task goal: Confirm they qualify for the study, learn how they receive information from VA about financial things, and how that's meeting their needs.**

Before we look at the website, I'd like to get a little background information from you:

1. As part of the scheduling for this session, we asked if you had either received payments from VA or incurred education, compensation, pension, or health care-related debt. Can you tell me how you got info from VA about updates on those payments or debts?
  
2. You mentioned that you receive updates on your payments or debts via *insert what the participant said*. What information about your payments and debts is included? Was that helpful? Was anything missing?
  
3. How do you manage your VA finances? Online, by mail, etc?

4. Let's talk about the website - how do you use VA.gov? *If they use it:* Do you ever visit My VA when you are logged in?

6. Do you know your username and password to log in to VA.gov?
	* If not: Are these readily accessible? Could get them?
	* If the user can not remember or retrieve their login credentials, **end the session.** Without login credentials, we aren't able to test this feature with you today so I'm going to end the call. Thank you so much for your willingness to participate; it is greatly appreciated.
	
7. Today we are going to observe you interacting with the new feature on your computer. Are you comfortable sharing your screen with me once you log in?
	* If no: Explain this is necessary for testing. If they are still unwilling, **end the call.** I completely understand. However if you're not comfortable sharing your screen for the session, we aren't able to test this feature with you today so I'm going to end the call. Thank you so much for your willingness to participate; it is greatly appreciated.
	
Great! Thanks for confirming all of that. Let’s move on to the website.
