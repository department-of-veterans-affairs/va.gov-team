# Research Plan for Authenticated Experience, My VA Benefit Payments and Debts UAT, October 2022
## Background
Throughout [My VA 2.0 research and discovery](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research) in 2020 - 2021, the recurring theme mentioned by Veterans is that seeing payment info on their My VA dashboard is a high priority. The importance of payment information is also reflected in analytics, as viewing payments is a top interaction on VA.gov overall and is a top search term from the My VA dashboard. In our recent [My VA usability study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/payment-history/discovery-and-research/june-2022-research/research-findings.md), we heard from all participants that they would strongly prefer to manage VA debt on VA.gov than through the mail and over the phone.

This effort aims to add more detail around debt and payment information to the My VA dashboard to be elevated for logged-in Veteran’s awareness and attention, and also to add copays as a type of debt that can be accessed from My VA.

See our [product brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/payment-history) for more details.

### OCTO-DE Objectives 
The addition of timely debt and payment updates should help fulfill our north star objective of moving toward My VA being the one-stop shop for action items and benefit status, so that it provides more direct, personalized routes to Veterans’ most critical updates and tasks and cuts down on necessary phone and mail communication.

### Veteran Journey
Since Veterans can receive payments and incur debt any time after establishing benefits with VA, this work impacts the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) from Starting Up and beyond.

## Research Goals	
The primary goal of our UAT is to confirm that functionality works as expected in our new "Outstanding debts" and "Benefit payments" sections.

As secondary goals, we’ll follow up on [our last usability study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/payment-history/discovery-and-research/june-2022-research/research-findings.md):
- We would like to validate that no usability hurdles have been introduced during the iterations that have occurred.
	- We eliminated the use of red and green color and want to make sure the page is still scannable without them.
	- We have made some content updates to align with other teams around payments and debts.
- We would like to learn more about challenges experienced by people who use magnification, have cognitive considerations, and use screen readers.

### Outcome
Based on the outcome of this research study, we will either release the two new sections to production and/or update our design to correct any significant usability hurdles people encounter.

### Research questions
- Does the functionality work as expected?
- Are Veterans able to take action on their payment or debt information without any usability hurdles?
- Has the elimination of red and green colors decreased the scannability of the page?
- Is any of the copy confusing to users?

### Hypothesis
- Veterans will not encounter any bugs in the payments and debts sections.
- Veterans will be able to easily take action on their payment and debt information from My VA.
- Veterans will not be confused by the terminology used for debts and payments.
- It will be clear what is due to VA from Veterans and what has been paid to them without the use of color to delineate.

## Method	
We'll have participants go through a list of specific tasks for UAT and ask follow-up questions to get feedback on our usability related questions. We will test in production with real user data.

### Location
Remote, via Zoom

### Research materials
[Conversation guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/payment-history/uat/v2-UAT-conversation-guide.md) 

## Recruitment	
Our intended audience for this research is mainly BIPOC Veterans, LGBTQ+ Veterans, assistive tech users, and Veterans with cognitive disabilities who have payments and debt with VA. We'll use Perigean to recruit them.

We are focusing our recruitment criteria on the marginalized groups we didn't speak with during [our last usability study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/payment-history/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings.md).

**Identity Assurance Levels**

- **IAL1:** Attributes, if any, are self-asserted or should be treated as self-asserted; there is no proofing process. (***Ex., User generated user name and pw***)

- **IAL2:** Either remote or in-person identity proofing is required using, at a minimum, the procedures given in NIST SP 800-63A. (***Ex., Id.me or Login.gov account***)

- **IAL3:** In-person or supervised-remote identity proofing is required. Identifying attributes must be verified through examination of physical documentation as described in NIST SP 800-63A.

### Screener questions
1. Do you need assistive technology to use your phone such as VoiceOver on an iPhone, TalkBack on an Android device, or JAWS on a computer? (Proceed to next question if yes)
