# Payment Info v2 UAT Findings Summary

## Who we talked to
* Completed veteran session demographics:
	* 72yo white man, desktop, urban, no AT
	* 78yo white man, desktop, rural, screen reader user
	* 63yo white woman, mobile, rural, no AT
	* 46yo white woman, mobile, urban, no AT
* 4 out of 15 were completed sessions

## Research Questions and Outcomes
**1. Does the functionality work as expected?**
  * Yes. 4 out of 4 users said the information displayed for their debts and payments was accurate and all links went to the expected places.
  
**2. Are Veterans able to take action on their payment or debt information without any usability hurdles?**
  * Yes. 4 out of 4 users were able to use the action links as intended. This includes our one screen reader user who was able to tell where there was an actionable link in both sections. 
  * The screen reader user at first missed the "Manage your VA debt" link even though the screen reader read it to him, but was able to find it when he went back through the section.
  
**3. Has the elimination of red and green colors decreased the scannability of the page?**
  * No. 4 out of 4 users noticed the debts and payments sections and were able to tell the difference between them without the use of color.
  
**4. Is any of the copy confusing to users?**
  * No. We didn't hear any participants say they were confused about debt, overpayments, benefit payments, or any other new terminology in these sections. We did have one user who couldn't complete the session who didn't associate copays as debts, which we have heard in the past from roughly half of the veterans we have talked to. 

## Bugs
* None

## Other findings

### Content feedback
* We made a decision to **eliminate dollar amounts for debts and copays** since we learned that the only data being used in the combined debt portal currently is the most recent statement balance, which may not reflect some paymens already made. We didn't want to cause confusion by sharing a dollar amount that may not be accurate to a Veteran's current situation so the debt and copay cards now say the number of debts and/or copays that a veteran has.
	* We can now confidently say **this was the correct choice** given the data limitations because all participants said the debt information looked accurate to them and they didn't have any questions or confusion about it. 
* We have also made some **changes to terminology** in the debt section as instructed by the content team and wanted to make sure those words were not confusing to Veterans in testing. We now refer to debts as "overpayment debts" and that made sense to all 4 participants and they didn't have any questions about what the debt was for or whether it was valid.

### Research study setup
* We encountered a lot of issues with no-shows, users who could not successfully log in to VA.gov, and users who were LOA1.
	* 4 out of 15 were no-shows
	* 1 out of 15 signed on but had to reschedule
	* 1 out of 15 could not connect to audio and dropped off
	* 2 out of 15 tried to log in during the session but were unsuccessful
	* 2 out of 15 were LOA1 so we ended the session
* Although about 25% no-shows are expected in a given study, there are reasons for the unsuccessful logins and LOA1 users:
  * The criteria that a user must be able to log in to VA.gov during the session was not communicated to participants in the survey *or* the confirmation email. This was an oversight on Perigean's part and should be included in both the survey and email communications. Most of the veterans who joined the session were not aware ahead of time that they would be required to log in during the session.
  * The criteria that a user must have an identity verified account on VA.gov was not communicated to participants in the survey or the confirmation email. Perigean misunderstood that criteria in the research plan and did not include it in the survey or email to Veterans.

**Recommendations** 
* Any must-have criteria should be outlined in the screener questions in the research plan, even if they are already outlined in the recruitment criteria table as well.
* We should ask to see the Calendly survey and the screener email before it is sent out to participants.
* If possible, it would be helpful to have a short kick-off call with Perigean before participants are recruited so both parties are clear on the requirements and what we are trying to accomplish in the sessions.
* Ask Perigean to follow up with participants before sessions to verify that they are able to meet the technical requirements (i.e. They have Zoom downloaded, can screen share, can log in to VA.gov for the session, have an identity-verified account, etc.)
