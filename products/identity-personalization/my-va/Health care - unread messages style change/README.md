## Health Care - Unread Messages
### Style change

- We are using a different alert/notification style on the new Benefit payments and debts section for # of outstanding debt, we want to maintain consistency throughout the My VA page.  
- We are updating the style of the Health care - unread messages block to match the new style.  This will retain consistency throughout the My VA page, and call out the important, potentially time-sensitive pending items.
