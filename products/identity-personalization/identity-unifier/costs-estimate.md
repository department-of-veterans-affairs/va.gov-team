Working document on costs incurred by _not_ taking the steps outlined in this project.

By category of costs:

## Look-Up time
Staff searching multiple systems to determine Veteran status; estimates in Angela's white paper. Not all of these costs would disappear with the recommendations discussed.

## Data cleaning

### Contact center calls

### Staff time to manually correct duplicates/errors

## Extra data maps storage
each system storing a map from their internal ID to ICN

## Extra system functionality to screen and reconcile identities
each system maintaining a map from their internal ID to ICN

## New system set-up time/governance
e.g. new MVI and VADIR integrations

## Duplicative cross-system data dumps
effort spent on repeatedly dumping data across systems to make different systems more comprehensive, instead of doing this once
