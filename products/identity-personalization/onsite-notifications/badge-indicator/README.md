## Overview

The badge indicator is a notification style that aims to call a Veteran's attention to priority items within their account. The MVP implementation aims to draw Veterans' attention to unread messages within their MyHealtheVet (MHV) inbox from the My VA dashboard.

## Problem statement

- As a VA.gov user, I want to be able to easily see that there are items that require my attention, as well as how many items require my attention or action when I log into the website, and specifically in this case when I visit the Health Care section on My VA.

## User Outcomes

### Desired User Outcomes

- Users will more easily be able to find items that need their attention and know how many items require their attention.

### Undesired User Outcomes

- Done wrong, the badge indicator could be missed by users.

## Business Outcomes

### Desired Business Outcomes

- The badge indicator is simple and easily scalable as an attention mechanism.

### Undesired Business Outcomes

- The badge indicator becomes overly or improperly used

## Design
- Please see experimental design submission: [#3229](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-design-system-documentation/issues/3229)

## Research
The team conducted a usability study around the usage of the badge indicator as well as a dot indicator and slim alert banner. Documentation and findings from that study can be found [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/onsite-notifications/dot-indicator/research/2024-03%20Dot%20Indicator%20and%20Slim%20Alert%20Usability%20Study).
