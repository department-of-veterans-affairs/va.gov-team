# Badge indicator FE documentation - My VA Health Care inbox link implementation 

**Last updated:** October 1 2024 - added the majority of the details for the component. _Note that elements related to error handling are still WIP._

This document outlines specs for implementing the badge indicator on the "Go to your inbox" link in the Health Care section on My VA. The link provides access the health care secure messaging inbox. For full documentation on the Health Care section of My VA, see [My VA: Health Care Use Cases](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/use-cases/health-care-use-cases).

**Accessibility specs** 
The component is implemented with aria text for screen reader usage. 

The aria text has variations depending on the number of unread messages/other unseen content:

- 1 item: "Go to your inbox. You have 1 new message."
- 2-99 items: "Go to your inbox. You have # new messages."
- More than 99 items: "Go to your inbox. You have more than 99 new messages."
- If no count can be displayed: WIP

**Positioning**
- The "Go to your inbox" link should always appear first in the stack of health care links. The stack of links appears on the lefthand side on desktop if the user does not upcoming appointments. Otherwise, it appears on the righthand side on desktop.

## Technical Implementation
_For engineer to complete: how does this feature actually work - i.e. what endpoints are being called, who owns those endpoints, what team(s) should be consulted if changes are needed or something breaks, etc._
