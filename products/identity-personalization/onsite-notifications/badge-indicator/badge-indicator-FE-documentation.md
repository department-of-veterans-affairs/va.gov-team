# Badge indicator FE documentation - My VA Health Care inbox link implementation 

**Last updated:** November 12, 2024 - Added revisions, final content for MVP.

This document outlines specs for implementing the badge indicator on the "Go to your inbox" link in the Health Care section on My VA. The link provides access the health care secure messaging inbox. For full documentation on the Health Care section of My VA, see [My VA: Health Care Use Cases](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/use-cases/health-care-use-cases). 

## Go to your inbox link

### With unread messages:

### Without unread messages:

## Error state - API and service related failure(s):

There are two possible scenarios with errors preventing the display of a message count:
- Inbox access is likely unavailable
- Inbox access is likely available

### If inbox access is likely unavailable

A [slim warning 'alert' component](https://design.va.gov/components/alert/#warning-alert) will display above the "Go to your inbox" link of the health care section of My VA, as well as a "?" displayed inside of the badge indicator adjacent to the link. 

_(For uses outside of Health care and My VA, error messaging using alerts may make sense as well but could require a different pattern/component)._

### If inbox access is likely available

With some error scenarios, it's possible secure messaging access may still be possible, even if a count cannot be given.

**Accessibility specs** 

The component is implemented with aria text for screen reader usage. 

The aria text has variations depending on the number of unread messages/other unseen content:

- 1 item: "Go to your inbox. You have 1 new message."
- 2-99 items: "Go to your inbox. You have # new messages."
- More than 99 items: "Go to your inbox. You have more than 99 new messages."
- If no count can be displayed: "Go to your inbox. We can't tell how many new messages you have at this time."

**Positioning**
- The "Go to your inbox" link should always appear first in the stack of health care links. The stack of links appears on the lefthand side on desktop if the user does not upcoming appointments. Otherwise, it appears on the righthand side on desktop.

## Technical Implementation
We use the `/my_health/v1/messaging/folders` endpoint to fetch a count of unread inbox messages, which provides this data to the UI.  Fetched response data is stored via redux.  [View the javascript implementation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/main/src/applications/personalization/dashboard/utils/helpers.js#L36) for more details.
