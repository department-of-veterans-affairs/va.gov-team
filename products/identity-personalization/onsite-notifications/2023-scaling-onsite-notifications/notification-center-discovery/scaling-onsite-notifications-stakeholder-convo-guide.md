# Conversation Guide for Authenticated Experience, Scaling Onsite Notifications Stakeholder Research 2023

## Intro

Thanks for joining us today! I'm Angela and I am a designer and researcher for the Authenticated Experience My VA team. We also have (attendees) with us here from the Authenticated Experience team. As you probably know, we're here today because we're doing some high-level discovery to scale the notifications feature on VA.gov, and we'd like to learn about your perspective on this work. 

Are you okay with me recording this meeting so I can be sure I've captured your feedback accurately?

*Hit record*

## Background
1. First, could you tell me about your role and what you do in your work on VFS?
2. How long have you been in this role?
3. Who are the people and teams you work most closely with?

## General Notification Discussion (All)
1. Who are your team's users? What do they need to do? What common actions do they take on VA.gov?
2. Has your team talked to users at all about notifications? If so, do you have anything of note to share or studies you would recommend that we reference?
3. What are your expectations around how we elevate notifications on VA.gov?
4. Are there any near-term needs that you're aware of for your portfolio regarding notifications?

## Challenges with Scaling Notifications (All)

There are some challenges we can already foresee with scaling onsite notifications but we're curious to get your take on it.
1. *If not already discussed:* Do you have any thoughts around scaling the notifications feature over time?
2. How do you think we can build veteran trust as we scale this feature? What would make or break trust when it comes to notifications?

## Practice-specific

### Chris Johnston - Portfolio lead
- How does scaling the notifications feature on VA.gov align with the overall VA.gov vision (if at all)? 
- We try to work closely with the mobile app team to align on features and language when we make updates to the authenticated experience on VA.gov since the two are so closely related. Do you have any thoughts about the correlation between VA.gov notifications and the mobile app?

### Rachel Han - Mobile app lead
- What is your overall vision for how the mobile app and the logged in experience on VA.gov should be alike and different?
- We try to work closely with the mobile app team to align on features and language when we make updates to the authenticated experience on VA.gov since the two are so closely related. Do you have any thoughts about the correlation between VA.gov notifications and the mobile app?

### Lauren Alexanderson, Coulton Bunney, Patrick Bateman, Kay Lawyer, and Kristen McConnell - Health portfolio
- Are there any timelines for the My HealtheVet to VA.gov transition that we should be aware of? 
- As your team moves My HeatheVet functionality over to VA.gov, what opportunities do you see to use notifications to elevate that work?

### Dave Conlon - Sitewide lead
- Do you have thoughts about how we might want to consider surfacing notifications within the logged in experience?
- We know you've talked with Samara before about notifications that are in the gray space between general and personalized, like if a user's VAMC was closed for emergency purposes, for example. Do you have any thoughts to share about those types of notifications?

### Matt Self - Benefits lead
- How do you see notifications on VA.gov elevating the benefits work that your teams are doing?
- Are there opportunities to surface important benefit notifications that you're particularly interested in putting on our roadmap, even if they're not immediately technically feasible?

### Mikki Northuis - IA/Nav lead
- Do you have thoughts about how we might want to consider surfacing notifications within the logged in experience?
- What IA considerations should we be aware of as part of our work to scale notifications on VA.gov?

### Chante Lantos-Swett - Account experience and customer support lead
- Are there customer support issues that you see an opportunity to alleviate with the use of notifications on VA.gov?

### Martha Wilkes - Accessibility lead
- Is there any advice you have about the most accessible approach to notification patterns? Have you come across any sites that are doing it particularly well?
- Is there anything we should do differently than we typically do to engage with a11y folks early and often as part of this work?

### Matt Dingee - Design lead
- What thoughts or concerns do you have about the representation of notifications on VA.gov as we scale this feature?

### Ray Wang - Platform lead
- How is the collab cycle process different for changes that can affect the entire site versus just our page that we own? Are there any specific challenges we should expect?
