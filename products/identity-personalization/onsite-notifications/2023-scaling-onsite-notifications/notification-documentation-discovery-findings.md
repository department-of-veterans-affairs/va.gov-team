## Research Goals
The goal of this work was to start viewing the VA.gov notification landscape more holistically and to highlight opportunites for expanding on it.

This research supported this goal by:

* Documenting the different types of notifications/alerts that commonly power web products
* Documenting whether we are already utilizing those on VA.gov or not
* Doing discovery work to look into other popular design systems and how they utilize notifications and alerts.
* Identifying opportunities worth exploring for VA.gov found in this discovery research

|Type of notification|Purpose|Documentation|VA Examples|Opportunities|
|----|----|-----|-----|-----|
|Alerts|- To announce that a feature is down. The user didn't cause this type of alert <br> - To draw attention something on a page that may require user action <br> - A more urgent (often red) version is used when something destructive is about to occur.|[Alerts in VA Design System](https://design.va.gov/components/alert) <br> Note: Yellow warning alert is to announce a feature is down or to draw attention to important action items; red error alert is to announce that something destructive may occur.|<img width="507" alt="Screenshot 2023-08-11 at 12 37 49 PM" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/97965610/5e6533a6-a7ff-4cf5-88d4-2b618e468a5f"> <br> <img width="603" alt="Screenshot 2023-08-15 at 12 30 06 PM" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/97965610/2fdff79e-f041-4d06-829a-f3dd801cf3e6"> <br> <img width="472" alt="Screenshot 2023-08-11 at 12 48 07 PM" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/97965610/aa9ec5b5-5782-4f7e-acaa-eb6a2422686a"> <br> <img width="603" alt="Screenshot 2023-08-16 at 9 57 45 AM" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/97965610/dcf42761-849a-4806-bac5-c97cfdddea25">|- The CST team is pioneering a card style that includes a slim alert to draw attention to a specific card if something is needed from the user.

## Key Takeaways

- We're already using most types of notifications/alerts but there's a lot of potential to better standardize the way we use them across VA.gov and expand upon the current usage.
- The exploration of personalized indicators is under way with the MHV to VA.gov team collaborating with the Auth Exp team on a dot indicator, but this project brought to light how we could expand even further on personalized indicators and consider that for certain use cases a badge with a number may be more appropriate.
    - We can reference other design systems' documentation for guidance on when to use each, like [Google Material Design Badges](https://m3.material.io/components/badges/overview).
- Our usage of tags as a status indicator could be more standardized across VA.gov, and we may want to consider utilizing it on My VA when we look at changing the style of the cards to default white.
- The only type of notification/alert we came across in this discovery work that we are not currently using on VA.gov in any form is a takeover modal.
    - Not sure if there are any use cases for this and think we can effectively highlight extremely important info/updates with notifications but it's a potential pattern to keep in mind.
- **The ultimate goal is for all digital VA products to speak to each other** and this is especially true with notifications. The mobile app team is ahead of us in this realm and we can learn from them as well as work towards a unified notification strategy; a world where a user gets a notification in the app and addresses it and then sees it as read/seen in the VA.gov experience, for example.
