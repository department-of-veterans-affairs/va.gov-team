# Notification documentation discovery

We should document the different types of notifications/alerts that commonly power web products, and whether we are already utilizing those on VA.gov or not. The goal of this work is to start viewing the VA.gov notification landscape more holistically, and to highlight opportunites for expanding on it.

**Notification/alert type examples**

This is not intended as an exhaustive list, so feel free to add to it.

- System alerts (eg. An alert announcing that a feature is down)
- Event-based notifications (eg. A save confirmation)
- General, non-personalized announcements
- Personalized notifications (eg. "you have a new debt")
- Personalized indicators (eg. a "2" next to an inbox to indicate 2 new messages)
- Status tags (eg. "Expiring soon"; "Prescription shipped") -- Is this a notification/alert?

**Things we'd want to document**

This is not intended as an exhaustive list, so feel free to add to it.

- What is the purpose of this type of notification? 
- When might a user see this type of notification?
- Does VA.gov already employ this type of notification? If so, where/how?
  - Note: We don't need to recreate any documentation. Things like system alerts are already well documented in the design system, so we should link off to existing documentation where it makes sense.
- Opportunities for use on VA.gov (if we're not already employing a notification/alert type)

**Things we do NOT need to do**

- We don't need any more documentation on different dashboard or notification center treatments. We've already captured that.

- We don't need to gather exhaustive examples of treatments and styling. For example, it doesn't necessarily matter whether something appears as a modal, bubble, in-line message etc. What matters is the type of notification and what it's trying to communicate.
