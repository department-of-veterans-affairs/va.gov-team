# Onsite Notifications In-take Process

This document serves as an overview of the in-take process (in partnership with VA Notify) for new onsite notifications on My VA. This assumes VA Notify has already evaluated that a candidate already meets criteria to be a notification of _some kind._

## General Process

1. Team A comes to VA Notify to work with them on establishing email and/or text notification.
2. Team A works with VA Notify through their existing intake and discovery process.
4. Once Team A's feature reaches the point where the notification is going to be implemented (or it's out of the discovery phase), VA Notify performs an initial "vetting" of the notification (see below) to determine if it's something My VA would want to implement as an onsite notification.
5. VA Notify team shares their findings with the My VA team via a formal slack thread (in accountexp-authexp), further discussion as well in bi-weekly syncs. 
6. If My VA wants to pursue/consider adding the notification as an onsite notification to My VA, then they bring the item into their backlog.


## Vetting Notifications for Onsite Use
_How do we determine if a notification (email or text) should be an onsite notification?_

My VA's top priorities:
- Action items: requires a veteran to do somehting in order to advance a process (or prevent a process from stalling)
- Communicate high-priority benefit status/updates that don't necessarily require action

For more details, see [Onsite Notification Criteria](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/onsite-notifications#onsite-notification-criteria).

### Criteria
_Criteria assumes all notifications are personalized to the user (i.e. no blasts or blanket announcements._

1. **Is the notification in question a confirmation or success message?**
2. **Is the notification actionable?**
3. **If not-actionable, is the notification in question a high priority status update?**
