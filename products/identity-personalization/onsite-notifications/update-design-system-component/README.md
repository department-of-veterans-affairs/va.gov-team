## Overview

[The onsite notification MVP](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/onsite-notifications/mvp#readme) launched in October 2022. As part of this work, we submitted a new notifcation design to the design system, and it was approved for build. We now need to build the component, have it added to the design system library, and update our notification styling on My VA.

## Problems

The design system does not have a style for user notifications that is different from system alert or warning styles. This makes it hard to differentiate between the two.

## User outcomes

### Desired User Outcomes

- Easily be able to identify any required actions for me on VA.gov. 

### Undesired User Outcomes

## Business outcomes

### Desired Business Outcomes

- Encourage interactions with time-sensitive and action-oriented tasks.
- Scale onsite notifications functionality.
- Create a notification style that is different from our existing system alerts.

### Undesired Business Outcomes

## Measuring success

TBD

## Solution approach

- Designed new component and discussed with design system team, and 
- [Tested this design in payments V2 testing, August 2022](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/payment-history/discovery-and-research/june-2022-research/research-findings.md#1-users-will-be-able-to-clearly-see-and-read-the-notification-at-the-top-of-the-page-and-will-know-how-to-act-on-it-if-they-wished-to-see-more-details-or-resolve-a-debt)
- [Submitted experimental design submission, and received approval](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-design-system-documentation/issues/1181)
- Building out component and updating My VA
