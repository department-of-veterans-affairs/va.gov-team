# Product outline: Personalized notifications & alerts on VA.gov (onsite notifications)

**Last updated: October 31, 2023 -- updated note and projects section**

NOTE: On October 3, 2023, the Notifications section on My VA (onsite notifications MVP) was removed from production. The feature was hidden behind a feature flag (and will eventually be removed from code) after the team and stakeholders determined this feature was not the right solution for elevating personalized updates at this time.

## Overview

VA.gov is in the process of implementing a comprehensive communication strategy to support email, text, and in-app (ie. on VA.gov) notifications. Currently, the VANotify and VEText platforms team builds and manage email and text notification. The authenticated experience team aims to cover information around the third and final pillar -- personalized notifications and alerts that show to logged-in users on VA.gov.

## Onsite notification criteria

### In scope

[This is reflective of the overall priorities for My VA and personalization](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va#opportunities--priorities).

1. **Action items**: Our top priority for onsite notifications are any items that require a veteran to take action in order to move along a process. Examples might include alerting a veteran to an outstanding debt or copay that's due; alerting veterans to unread messages from their health care team; prompting Veterans to upload evidence to a disability claim; etc.
2. **Communicate high-priority benefit status & updates that donâ€™t require action**: Our second priority is to communicate know high-priority updates that are generally important to people but don't necessarily require them to take any action. Examples might include an update to a claim; prescription shipment; a direct deposit payment to their account, etc.

### Out of scope

- **Benefit suggestions**: Currently, onsite notifications should not be used as a place to surface benefit suggestions. In the event VA.gov is able to support eligibility information, we need to think about if and how onsite notifications might fit into this.
- **Organizational announcements**: Onsite notifications should be personalized, so organization-wide announcements, emergency or otherwise, are out of scope.
- **Confirmation messages**: We do not need to show onsite notifications that confirm an action a person just took (eg. submitting a form).

## Problem Statement

- As a customer of VA, I need to know if there are tasks I need to complete so that I can receive or manage my benefits.
- As a customer of VA, I need to know if VA has taken an action that affects my health and benefits, even if no action is required from me (eg. VA shipped a prescription).

## User outcomes

### Desired User Outcomes

- VA.gov users will be able to find and complete necessary tasks more quickly.
- As a result, VA.gov users may receive benefits or other outcomes more quickly.
- VA.gov users may also more easily avoid unideal outcomes if we can get information in front of them more quickly (eg. updating the number of dependents they have so their compensation payments are correct).

### Undesired User Outcomes

- Not alerting users to important updates.
- Confusion or lack of syncing between in how notifications are handled across VA.gov (data integrity). We can avoid this through close coordination with other VA.gov teams, the VA mobile team, and VANotify.
- Notifications feeling like noise because there are too many of them. 

## Business outcomes

### Desired Business Outcomes

- We create a unified, consistent experience for how notifications/alerts are handled across VA.gov.
- We create a unified, consistent experience for how information is surfaced on VA.gov and in the VA mobile app.

### Undesired Business Outcomes

- This tool becomes a bandaid for bad information architecture and navigation.
- This tool is over-utilized and results in more noise than guidance.

## Measuring success

- Initial metrics will be tracked as part of the [on-site notifications MVP](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/onsite-notifications/mvp#measuring-success).

## Security

## Backend

### How the VANotify integration works

We receive on-site notifications from [VA Notify](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/partner-services-upstream-services). For the MVP, the system works as follows:

- The debt management center backend (DMC) will add debts for a given set of users. Those debts will show up in the debt tool in VA.gov.
- Once a day, the DMC backend will send a batch request to VA Notify to send out notifications to folks alerting them that they have a new debt.
- VA Notify will then send out notifications:
  - An email notification (this existed prior to the on-site notification MVP and was an entirely separate effort).
  - A notification that shows on someone's My VA personalized dashboard if they are logged in and identity-verified (LOA3) on VA.gov.
  - Users receive notifications based on their preferences. Email notifications can be turned off; _on-site notifications can not_. 
- If VA Notify determines it should send the "you have a new debt" notification to VA.gov, it will send a `user id` and `template id` to VA.gov. This is what tells us (My VA) to show the "you have a new debt" notification and to whom.

[Additional technical documentation from VA Notify on how the on-site notification functionality works on VA.gov](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-notify/onsite-notifications/README.md#workflow-overview)

See [Onsite Notification Technical Overview](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/onsite_notifications/technical-overview.md) for more detailed technical workflows and explanations about the solution.

### How to test

Currently, there is only one notification to test (2022). In the future, there may be multiple notifications that need to be tested in different ways. 

- For information on how to test the on-site notification MVP ("you have a new debt"), [please refer to the project outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/onsite-notifications/mvp#how-to-test).

## Frontend

### How the VANotify integration works

- The frontend connects to VA Notify via an API we set up.
- Currently, the frontend code stores the content for on-site notifications. This may be stored by VA Notify some time in the future, but not for the MVP.
- If VA Notify determines it should send a notification to VA.gov, it will send a `user id` and `template id` to VA.gov. This is what tells us to show which notification and to whom.

#### When are the notifications fetched from the server?

The notifications are pulled on load using a GET request to the api `/v0/onsite_notifications` if they have no MPI errors and they are an LOA3 user. 

* If there are any notifications, that are not dismissed, we show the notifications.
* If there are no notifications we do not show the section.
* If there is an error on the backend preventing notifications from appearing, then we do not display the Notifications section on the page.
* If there is an error when the user attempts to dismiss the notification, we show an error.

#### If a user dismisses a notification

When a user dismisses a notification, we send a PATCH request to the api `/v0/onsite_notifications/${id}`. If they have an error we show the dismissal failed error. If there is no error we remove the notification from the page.
