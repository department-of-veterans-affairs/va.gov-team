[<h4>Notification Overload: Best Practices for Designing Notifications with Respect for Users</h4>](https://theblog.adobe.com/notification-overload-best-practices-for-designing-notifications-with-respect-for-users/)

1. Give users control over notifications
  * Let the user know what the notification is for, how it will be used, and let them have control over whether they receive it or not.
  * Let them control the notification at varying levels of granularity if needed.
2. Actionable notifications/Knowing when to stop
  * Notifications should be actionable and let the user know about something they can or need to do.
  * Stop sending reminders if people do not seem to be interacting with them
    * Ex. Duolingo stops sending practice reminders if people stop interacting with the app and let people know they'll be doing so.
3. Customize the content
  * Notifications should be contextually aware of a users particular circumstances and preferences.

**Types of notifications**

Some of these overlap:

* User generated
* Context generated — Notification based on permission and circumstances of user (eg. calendar reminder)
* System generated — Based on the needs of a product/application (eg. update your settings)
* Push notifications — Pushed through by a system. Either require action or don't.
* Notifications requiring action from the user
* Passive notifications — Provide info without requiring action.
* Smart notifications — Based on particular circumstances.

**What makes a good notification**

* Non-interfering — Should have purpose and cause as little of a disruption as possible.
* Small in size — Small in size, but effective.
* Contextual — Based on circumstances like where you are or what you're doing in a given moment.
* Serve warnings — Confirmations and warnings.

**When not to use notifications** 

* A user has never opened your app
* There is no value to bring to a user, such as “Haven’t seen you in a while”
* Requests to review or rate an app
* Operations that don’t require user involvement, like syncing information
* Error states from which the app may recover without user interaction

**How to design a good notification** 

* Consider the importance of the notification, and make design decision to support that.
* Provice enough information so people understand the purpose and what is supposed to be done.
* Give users choice over how to control notifications.
* Handle multiple notifications smartly — Roll them up into one group where each can be viewed individually.
* Embrace A/B testing.

Includes similar points to the ones already listed above.

9. Map notifications — Determine which notifications should be delivered in which way by mapping out whether they are high or low urgency, rich or simple content.

[<h4>Notification Design Strategies</h4>](http://www.uxbooth.com/articles/notification-design-strategies/)

Includes similar points to the articles listed above, but adds the following:

3. Relegate (some) interactions in the email itself — If possible, allow users to take action from email and don't require they sign into the app if they don't want to.
4. Remind users of additional actions, especially time—sensitive ones — Time-sensitive notifications are more likely to be seen as helpful.
5. Provide a digest – If there are going to be a significant number of notification, consider consolidating them into a digest.
