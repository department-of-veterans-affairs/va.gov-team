[Plain Text vs. HTML Emails: Which Is Better?](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/plain-text-vs-html-emails-data)

(July 2015)

* "Aside from proper list segmentation, nothing boosts opens and clicks as well as an old school, plain-text email."
* (However) "Having an HTML email does not hurt your deliverability as long as you have two things: a properly coded HTML email and a plain-text version."
* My thoughts — at least at first, we're not sending marketing emails so we're not necessarily concerned with "opens and clicks" in the same way marketers would be. When an email is closed, you can't tell whether it's plain text or HTML anyway.
* "Most email marketing tools will let you easily create plain-text versions within their email editor, so take those five extra minutes to create and optimize the plain-text version of your email. Otherwise, email providers such as Gmail or Outlook might think your email is dodgy -- they expect legitimate companies to follow this basic best practice."
  * Noted. Let's get the plain text right first regardless of whether we ultimately launch an HTML email.
* Interesting — in 2014, Hubspot conducted a survey where they asked over 1000 people if they preferred plain text or HTML emails, and 2/3 said they preferred the latter. The same % said they preferred emails with mostly images over text. However, when they A/B tested various levels of design in emails, the simpler, plainer presentations always won.
* The explanation may not have to do entirely with user's preferences:
  * "So the simple explanation is that **image tags and HTML-rich templates seem to be getting flagged by email providers as commercial email**, which means they get filtered out of a recipient's main inbox."
* The article also hypothesizes that plain text emails feel more personal because people don't usually add images or other visual treatments to personal exchanges.

(Dec 2017)

*  Multi-part MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)
* "Spam filters like to see a plain-text alternative. HTML-rich emails are a red flag for spam filters."
* Some email clients only give users the option to view a plain text version of an email.
* "Some users may also see HTML emails as a security and privacy risk, and choose not to load any images and have visibility over all links that are included in an email."
* If no plain text version is included and something goes wrong with loading the HTML version, users may be left looking at code.
* Regardless of plain text or HTML, observe good scannability practices (headings; whitespace; bulletpoints, clear CTAs).

* Note that HTML-rich emails might look different in different email clients.
* Advantages to plain text:
  * Higher chance of delivery to primary inbox in Gmail.
  * Some devices only display plain text.
  * Plain text feels more personal.
* Disadvantages to plain text
  * "Unable to track open rates. A key component of email marketing is being able to monitor the impact of each campaign. Unfortunately, you cannot track open rates or enable click tracking in plain text emails. This makes it difficult to track the success of a campaign that employs the plain text approach."
  * Minimal designs and customization.
  * Unable to display links. URLs create visual clutter.
  * Hard to break into sections.
  * No multiple-column formatting.
* HTML advantages
  * Greater visual appeal.
  * Can personalize content based on what you know about the user.
  * Emails may be easier to scan if good hierarchy is used.
  * Can include links and buttons.
  * Can track open rates.

[HTML vs. Plain Text Emails: Which Option Is Best?](https://www.pardot.com/blog/html-vs-plain-text-emails-which-option-is-best/)

* "At Pardot, we subscribe to a best practice called Multi-part MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions), which is described more in depth in the aforementioned Litmus article. Multi-part MIME bundles together a plain text and HTML version of an email, so that if an HTML email doesn’t load, the plain text version will display in its place."
* Advantages to plain text:
  * Universal readability
  * Higher delivery rates
  * User preferences — Some people may opt to view plain text only
  * Consistent rendering
  * Wearables — Watches only show plain text.
* When to use plain text vs. HTML
  * Salesforce opinion — Use HTML for things that come from the marketing team and plain text for more personal emails.

[HTML vs. Text Email: There’s No Debate in Email Marketing](https://www.sparkpost.com/blog/html-vs-text-email/)

General thesis: People shouldn't be sending marketing emails in plain text. Why:

* Deliverability comes down to more than having HTML heavy emails. Good delivery practices carry a lot of weight as well.
* There's no way to track things. Even personal emails can be made to look simple enough and use HTML for tracking.
* Multi-Part MIME messages takes care of the HTML can't/won't load or HTML is blocked use case. Basically the progressive enhancement of email.
* HTML allows branding, tracking, and the ability to hide URLs behind links/buttons.

[It’s Time to Drop the Text Version](https://www.clickz.com/its-time-to-drop-the-text-version/27908/)

This article feels very strongly that plain text emails are entirely obsolete.

* The score for HTML only in spam filters does exist, but it has a low impact on the overall spam/not spam rating.
* Very few platforms don't support HTML rich emails anymore (besides wearables).
* It "costs money" if you factor in the time to design/QA/maintain it in addition to an HTML rich email.
