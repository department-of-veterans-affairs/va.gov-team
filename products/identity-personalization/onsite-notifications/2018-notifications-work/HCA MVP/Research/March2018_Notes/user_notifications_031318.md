# Conversation Guide — HCA MVP Testing

[**Prototype**](https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/share/QYFXJH6RVNE#/screens/279927642_01-Home)

## GoToMeeting logistics

*In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute*

*In the Audio section, click the drop-down arrow and make sure "Play Entry/Exit Chimes" is unchecked*

*When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*

## Goals

1. To better understand expectations around receiving a confirmation email for benefit applications.
2. To evaluate the content in an application submission confirmation email for clarity and utility.
3. To better understand general preferences around receiving notifications.
4. To determine where else in the veteran journey digital notifications might be useful and helpful.
5. To determine whether text message notifications may be a good fit for this audience.

## We will know we have been successful if:

1. We have a clear idea of whether veterans who submit the healthcare application expect to receive a confirmation email, and find that confirmation clear, helpful, and useful.
2. We have a sense of what other kinds of notifications may be useful and helpful for vets.gov users.
3. We have a high-level sense of how veterans feel about text message notifications and where those might come into play for vets.gov.

## Who are our participants?

TBD

## Key research questions

1. Is a confirmation email for the healthcare application (and other benefit applications) expected, necessary, and useful?
2. Where else in the vets.gov ecosystem might notifications be helpful and useful?
3. How do people expect and prefer to receive notifications?

## Methods

- Remote usability testing of an InVision prototype of an updated healthcare application submission flow, followed by open-ended interview questions. 

## Conversation guide - Veterans and Current Servicemembers

## Intro



## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 2 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

*Background info about the participant should have been provided by Coordinator already, so use this time to ask any other questions that you feel will help with the session. This warm-up is not required*

- Can you tell me a little bit about yourself? (If stuck, prompt to ask about service experience, where they live, their work)
  - **Navy Veteran. Dates of active duty 1973 - 1984. Went into Naval Reserves, retired in 1993. Currently a travel agent part time.**
  - Favorite place to travel
    - **Cruises. Either Europe or Carribean.**
  - VA Benefits using
    - **Medical. Has used GI Bill (not sure if I got it right)? in the past**
- Have you ever used Vets.gov before?
  - **Yes. It's been a while now. Had looked up medical benefits for which I'm eligible - eligibility.**

Now I'm going to share my screen with you. You should see the Vets.gov homepage, which says "Get the VA Services You've Earned."

## First Task: Evaluate HCA submission confirmation page - 5 minutes

Let's pretend today that you are applying for healthcare on Vets.gov. You can navigate to the healthcare application now [Note: navigating to the application is not a task we are evaluating, so it's OK to help them get there if they are having trouble.]

Now you're on a page that says "Apply for health care benefits" at the top. It looks like you already have an application started, so go ahead and continue that application.

[On "Fast Forward" page] Before we continue, let's pretend that you've already filled out most of this application in previous sittings and you're just here today to submit the application. This screen you are looking at not is part of Vets.gov and is only trying to communicate that today in testing we are just here to submit the application. Do you have any question before we continue? OK, you may click anywhere to go to the next screen.

You'll notice now that we are back in the Vets.gov application flow. You are on a page where you can review your application. You may review it as you see fit, and then please submit the application. 

Now we're looking at a page that says "Apply for Healthcare — Form 10-10EZ" at the top:

1. **Sorry, I hit the wrong button in GoToMeeting. That's a problem I always have. I hit the wrong "X". **
2. **_reads and scrolls through the intro text_**
3. **I don't have a full screen for this. Privacy policy - I check that? I didn't read through everything.**
4. What is this page trying to communicate?
  * **10-10 EZ - is this the new form then?**
  * **Okay, this is for Joshua Harrison - that's someone else?**
  * **Do I need to click on "find out what happens after you apply"?**
  * **Okay, we usually process claims within a week - which is very good time. Some Veterans have complained about that in the past. Says please print this page for your records. Simple, date received, and the confirmation number. Telling you if you have any questions to call the toll free number (scrolls to bottom) - services and benefits that there are - disability, pension, and so forth. Veterans crisis line and contacts. Think this is telling us simply what to do.**
    * What do you mean by that
    * **If you needed further info, giving us info on how - with the confirmation number if you had any questions.**
  * [ONLY If they notice that they are going to get an email] When would you expect to receive that email?
5. Is there anything you would do next, or are you finished with this process?
   1. **You'd have to go to the email to confirm that they received the application**
   2. When would you expect to receive the email?
      1. **It says within a week. but wait, I'd expect to receive the email within an hour to confirm it.**
      2. **_sees email notification_**

### Things to watch for:

- Does the participant notice that this page tells them to look out for an email?

## Second Task: Evaluate new HCA submission confirmation email - 10 minutes

If you can, please click anywhere on this screen. If I can draw your attention to the top of the page, you'll see you have a new email from Vets.gov. Please click that notification, and let's take a look at the email.

1. What is this email trying to communicate?

   1. **Just confirming that you (VA) have received the application. If we don't have a printer, we should write the confirmation number down. we should keep it for our records.**

2. Why is the VA sending you this email?

   1. **It's much faster and more efficient to confirm it. Otherwise, people would phone in wondering if they received the application.**

3. What would you do if you had follow-up questions about your application?

   1. **Call the toll free number, I think. Okay, you're going to get a call and you're going to get a letter in the mail. That's nice - you're going to do both  if I understand correctly - a letter and a phone call.**
   2. "find out what to do next" link
      1. **If the application wasn't approved, you could find out how to file an appeal, I imagine. And sample health benefits handbook. If it is approved, it would have the health benefits handbook to find out what to do with your benefits.**
   3. **Well, you could call the number if you are impatient. Some Veterans are very impatient. Or you could just wait for the letter**
      1. How long would you wait before calling?
         1. **I'd wait a week as it said in the previous screen - it takes only a week**

4. Would you say this email is useful or not useful? Why or why not?

   1. **I think it's useful. You just have to read it carefully**
   2. **It gives contact numbers and hours of when we can call. You can download a health benefits handbook. I would think - you have to know computers. Not every Veteran knows computers - you have to download that handbook**
   3. **I have to read carefully - missed it first time - "please don't apply again if you haven't heard from us" - you're supposed to call the helpline**
      1. Would you be likely to apply again?
         1. **I don't think so. I never applied for disability. This is for general medical benefits, right? If I hadn't heard in a week, I would call the number myself.**

5. I'd like to draw your attention to the top of the page to the email address that sent this email — vetsdotgov@public.govdelivery.com. What do you think "public.govdelivery.com" is? 

  1. **This is a generic address for the department of VA.**

  * Would you trust an email coming from this address?
    * **I think so. It is very generic… I don't know how you could avoid it as being a scam, but I think "vetsdotgov" since it doesn't have the "." it has the "dots" filled out… I think I would trust it**
    * What criteria would you use to determine if it's trustworthy?
      * **You have to look at it closely. I would click on the "from" address to see if it has another email address under it. I think we have to be very careful from letters assuming to be the VA. If I wasn't sure, I would call the toll free number. I would ask "is this a bonafide address from the VA health system?"**

6. After submitting an application like the healthcare application, would you expect to receive an email like this?

   1. **Yes, I would. With the _ (Local) health clinic, we receive a newsletter, so everybody, or many people aren't computer competent, and they don't want to wait for a mail letter, so they'd rather have it very quickly.**
   2. Would you be surprised?
      1. **I would not be surprised, no.**

7. How long after you hit "submit" would you expect to receive this email?
  - **Oh, you asked this before. I would say, a couple of minutes if it was valid. Before I said an hour, I would wait.**
  - If you didn't receive this email right away, what would you think if you received it a few hours after submitting your application? A day or two? A week?
    - Hour or two later?
      - **I would think there's a computer glitch or something - the computers were overwhelmed if it took that long since they received it - not that they looked at the application - they received it**
    - Day or two later?
      - **Don't think I would mind, but it really shouldn't take that long. Not sure if it's a computer or a person who looks at it to make sure all the info is correct.**

### Things to watch for:

- Is the email useful?
- Did they expect to receive this email?
- Is this an email they want to receive, or does it feel like noise?

## Third Task: General questions about notification expecations and needs - 20 — 30 minutes

Thanks for sharing your thoughts on this email. Next, I'd like to close this screen and just ask you some questions.

- What benefits applications have you submitted to the VA?
  - **Have not applied for any mortgage benefits. That was in the days before they had computers, I think. Oh, any application (not necessarily online): I did call up the White House VA about genesite. It was not a complaint, it was a suggestion. They helped me very nicely. I had a question about how to apply for that benefit. Can you name some benefits? **
    - Education, pension, housing, medical, disability, career
      - **Oh, yeah, career benefits. 20 years ago I went down to get a job. That was not the VA - it was the unemployment office of Michigan. I used the VA jobs counselor. So it wasn't directly with the VA**
    - Remember applying for medical benefits or GI Bill
      - **Yes, I was in active duty still when I was using the GI Bill. There was paperwork to fill out. I started using it in 1978 when I was stationed in Japan, had to fill out paperwork so that I could be reimbursed for tuition.**
- After you'd submitted that application, did you feel like you knew what to expect next? How did the VA keep you informed about progress and next steps? 
  - **Not exactly, but I remember how the check was sent to the school, and I had to sign for the check. (specific school) That was the overseas school that I attended. **
  - **They sent a form letter saying how many months I had left. Then after I was discharged, I used more of the GI Bill.**
  - [If applicable] How could they have kept you informed better?
  - [If not already answered] Through what mean of communication would you have preferred the VA use to communicate with you in this process? This could be mail, phone, email, text messages, or anything else you can think of.
    - **I suppose you'd use computer. I'm from the old school, but I would not mind letters. I'd feel a little more comfortable with a letter. When I do my taxes, I always do it by mail rather than online. I feel a little more comfortable. Though I don't mind a duplicate email to confirm information.**
    - Text message?
      - **No, I would not want a text message. I do have a cell phone, but I don't like text messages. It's much more difficult to type with your fingers on a phone than on a laptop or a PC.**
    - Other correspondence that would be helpful coming from VA?
      - **I did receive a letter from the VA headquarters years ago about different problems they had. I forget the exact context. I have received letters before through the mail.**
    - What kinds of things would you want to hear electronically?
      - **I'd like to hear if there's a new VA secretary. I must say, I'm on the website for Vietnam Vets of America. They keep track of all the national news in washington. This gene site - I found about from them for the depression I have - they gave the info about that. They're on top of it - knowing what's going on. Other way I find out is through Yahoo - showing what's in the news, and we don't hear about it otherwise.**
    - If VA could communicate with you directly, would you like that?
      - **Yes, would be nice.**
      - **Any changes in the laws, new policies they have, regulations.**
- In what other ways besides submitting applications have you interacted with the VA? 
- How could the VA have kept you better informed or communicated more efficiently with you in these interactions?
  - [If not already answered] Through what mean of communication would you have preferred to communicate with the VA in this process? This could be mail, phone, email, text messages, or anything else you can think of.
- In addition to everything we just talked about, is there any other correspondence that you can think of that would be helpful from the VA?
  - [If not already answered] Through what means of communication
- [If not already answered] Would you be opening to receiving emails from the VA? Why or why not? What kinds of emails?
- [If not already answered] Would you be opening to receiving text messages from the VA? Why or why not? What kinds of text messages?

Now I'd like to ask you some questions about emails and other correspondence you might receive currently from companies or organizations other than the VA.

- I'd like you to think of the emails you currently receive. Other than personal emails from people you know, what kinds of emails do you get?

  - **Many from my travel business, emails from different political orgs like Right to Life, numerous emails from these quasi-political organizations. Department of Defense - I receive some emails from them since I'm under Tricare also. So I receive Tricare weekly. The Tricare website. I don't know what others. I receive so many.**

  - Which do you find useful?

    - ****

    - ​

  - [To clarify, if necessary] This could be any kind of email you might receive from a company or organization — something like a receipt from making a purchase, a newsletter, a notification about a sale at a store you shop at, or anything else you can think of.

- Of the emails you just mentioned [list a couple examples], which of these do you find useful? What kind of emails do you usually ignore, or wish you didn't get?

  - **Well, the political ones are asking for money, but it does give me info about what's going on around the world. I like to know what's going on nationwide or overseas. The Tricare doesn't always pertain to me since I'm retired, most of it is for active duty. They did recently consolidate into two regions. Would like to know a little more about how to apply. Not every provider accepts Tricare or Medicare. That's why I still have VA benefits. I have three. I try to keep abreast about who has the lowest prescription drugs - I think they're all about the same. There's really a lot to keep up with. Medicare, Tricare, and VA.**

- What makes you pay attention to an email that you receive from a company or organization?

  - **Well, I'm looking for cruises for the business, for example. I guess I open more emails than other people do. Might quickly read it and delete it right away. Some people would delete faster than I do.**
  - When you do open an email, what makes you stick with it and read it?
    - **I like to know what's going on in the world. If it's urgent. I might receive something from the Democratic or Republican Party. I'm not totally interested in that, especially if it's asking for money. not sure what words it would have to be in the heading. Hard to answer that question.**

- What do you find annoying or unhelpful in these emails, or about receiving these emails?

  - **usually it goes to junk. Receive a lot of appeals for money. Some from Nigeria, those scams. I try to specialize in cruises. I receive a lot of mail from the other dimensions of the travel business, and I delete those right away.**
  - **Well, asking for money, that's one thing. Another thing is if it's very long. I don't like it to be more than 2 pages long. If it's something long, I'd rather receive it through the mail.**
  - Another format you prefer?
    - **Paragraphs should be shorter. I don't like prolonged paragraphs. I don't know about whether it's in caps if it makes a difference. Well, yes, the caps might emphasize certain points. I think bullet points, I would like, as you would send in a regular letter.**
    - Company or organization you think does a good job with emails?
      - **Maybe Tricare. I think it's not the best, but I can't offhand think of anyone that stands out except maybe the city of Grand Rapids - I receive emails from them sometimes. They're just short and to the point**

- Do you ever receive things like receipts, reminders, or other notifications over text message in addition to, or instead of, email? 
  - **No. My wife does. I don't. I would rather just use my landline phone to receive reminders. For example, from the VA. Also I receive postcard reminders about appointments, and I receive the phone calls. Don't know if I really need both, but perhaps if the postcard was lost in the mail, I'd still have the (phone) reminder. I think that's a good idea. I suppose what you would like to do is put it into email also, but I would like to receive the phone call as a reminder first. Sometimes the computers are down, if there's an electrical outage..**
  - [If no] Would you be open to receiving text messages like this? If so, what kinds of things would you like to receive over text message? 
  - Remember the email we had looked at earlier that said the VA had received your healthcare application? Would you be open to receiving that confirmation as a text message instead of, or in addition to, an email?

### Things to watch for:

- What kind of correspondence would be helpful that may be things we can address with email/text/profile or dashboard notifications on Vets.gov?
- Are people open to receiving correspondence via text?
- What kinds of notifications do people general find helpful and useful? Noisy and annoying?

## Post-Task Interview - 2 minutes

Those are all the questions I have for you today. Do you have any other questions or comments about anything you've looked at or anything we've discussed today? 

1. **Does VA have plans if there's an electrical outage? You've heard about the electro-magnetic pulse, what would they do?**
2. **Some other Veterans are not happy with the VA, but I am.**

## Thank-You and Closing - X minutes
