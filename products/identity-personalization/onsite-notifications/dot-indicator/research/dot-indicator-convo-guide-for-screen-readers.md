## Starting the session
- _Keep observers in waiting room to ask participant if they still consent to having observers in the session. Tell them to have their camera on with full name displayed for a brief introduction to participant when they are admitted to the session._
- _Check your screensharing setup and share permissions for participants._
- _When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro._

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Matt. Today we're going to be reviewing some new features being considered for VA.gov.

Before we dive into it, could you please verify if you'll be using a screen reader for the session?
- *If no, switch to [sighted user conversation guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/onsite-notifications/dot-indicator/research/dot-indicator-convo-guide.md).
- *If yes, ask:* Okay, what kind of screen reader is it?

Okay, got it. Thank you! Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **I have a few other colleagues in the waiting room who would like to observe and take notes.** Are you okay with letting them in for this session?
	- _If participant does not consent, ask the observers to kindly leave the Zoom via Slack._
	- _If participant consents, let other observers into room and allow a short pause to say hello._ Here are some other members from our website team - if you'd all like to say a quick hello. And now for those of you who just joined, if you could please turn off your cameras to save bandwidth, that would be great.
 
- **This entire session should take no longer than 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you any longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic to keep us on schedule.

- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability; we are testing our work so you cannot do anything wrong here. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. As you go through the site, it'll be really helpful if you can think out loud as much as possible.
  
- **We will be using a made up account in VA.gov today. It's not going to be your personal account, and the information that you'll navigate through is for testing purposes only.** I'll prompt you with questions and actions to take once you've logged in to the test account. Does that all sound okay to you?
 
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
  
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly and I will pause the recording while you are signing in so we don't capture any of that info.
  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Research goal: Determine the accessibility implications of the dot or badge indicator - 30-45 minutes

Now I'm going to ask you to open the link I've shared (in Zoom Chat?) and then share your screen with me. Let me know if you need any help doing that.

Okay great, I can see your screen. Now please navigate to the "sign in" button and enter a username and a password. This is just a test, so you can enter anything in these fields. 

- *Once they have logged in and the full page has loaded* Now that you've logged in, how would you typically go about navigating the page?

- *Let them navigate down the page however they prefer. If they come across the links with indicators, ask:* What are the screen reader cues telling you about these links? How are you interpreting each of them? *Gauge whether the cues are stopping them in their tracks and seem important or are being ignored*
	- *If they did not navigate to the links with indicators, ask:* How would you find out if you have any unread health care messages?
   	- *If they did not navigate to the links with indicators, ask:* How would you find out if you have updates to prescriptions or prescription refills?
	- *If they did not navigate to the links with indicators, ask:* How would you find out if you have new lab results to review?

- How do you experience notifications on other websites and on your phone? Is there any website or app that does it particularly well?
  
- How do you think each of these notifications that are being read to you would no longer be there and it would just be a plain link?

- What would you expect to happen if you selected the link for "Go to your inbox" and it says **You have new messages**?

- What would you expect to happen if you selected the link for "Refill and track your prescriptions" and it says **You have 2 updates with your prescriptions and refills**?

Move on to badge indicator

Ok, we have one more weblink to share with you. (Share link, provide assistance as needed)

For this final part, I’d like for you to imagine you have recently filed for a new claim for compensation with the VA - you don’t need to be concerned about the other details of the claim for this exercise.

Where do you think on this page you could find the status of your claim?

   -  If they find the card: Okay, what do you think this message means? What do you think you might have to do next?

If someone has filed a claim before/has a disability rating, ask if they ever were asked in the past to provide more evidence and inquire about that

- If they have never filed a claim before, move on to Thanks and Closing

## Thanks and Closing - 2 minutes

Great, thank you so much. This has been really helpful for our team, and we appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. 

Do you have any questions or last thoughts for me before we end the session?

Thank you for your feedback and thank you so much again for joining us today. We really appreciate it.
