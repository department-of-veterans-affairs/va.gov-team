## Starting the session
- _Keep observers in waiting room to ask participant if they still consent to having observers in the session. Tell them to have their camera on with full name displayed for a brief introduction to participant when they are admitted to the session._
- _Check your screensharing setup and share permissions for participants._
- _When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro._

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Matt. Today we're going to be reviewing some new features being considered for VA.gov.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **I have a few other colleagues in the waiting room who would like to observe and take notes.** Are you okay with letting them in for this session?
	- _If participant does not consent, ask the observers to kindly leave the Zoom via Slack._
	- _If participant consents, let other observers into room and allow a short pause to say hello._ Here are some other members from our website team - if you'd all like to say a quick hello. And now for those of you who just joined, if you could please turn off your cameras to save bandwidth, that would be great.
- **This entire session should take no longer than 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you any longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic to keep us on schedule.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability; we are testing our work so you cannot do anything wrong here. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. As you go through the site, it'll be really helpful if you can think out loud as much as possible.
- **We will be looking at a made up account in VA.gov today. It's not going to be your personal account, and the information that you see is for testing purposes only.** I'll prompt you with questions and actions to take once you've logged in to the test account. Does that all sound okay to you?
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly and I will pause the recording while you are signing in so we don't capture any of that info.
  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
- **If participant is listed as colorblind - My understanding is that you are colorblind, is that correct? What kind of colorblindness you have?**
## Research goal: Determine the effectiveness of dot, badge, and slim alert indicators to draw attention to important updates and when it's appropriate to use each kind of indicator - Approx. 20-30 minutes

### Dot indicators

To start off, how often do you visit VA.gov? What do you use the website for?

Do you know if you have a disability rating? If so, what is it?

Okay, now I'm going to send you a weblink to take you to our prototype. Now I'm going to ask you to open the [link I've shared with you in Zoom chat](https://bit.ly/3TsleZe), and then for you to share your screen with me. Let me know if you need any help doing that.

Okay great, I can see your screen. By the way, if you see anything referring to CodePen while viewing this, it's just a tool we use to create prototypes and nothing out of the ordinary. 

- *Once the full page has loaded* What's standing out to you first?
- *If they don't mention the indicators* Okay interesting. Can you scroll down to the Health care section?
- **What stands out to you in the Health care section?**

- *For colorblind participants* Do you have any trouble seeing the dot? What color do they appear to be to you?
- *For colorblind participants* How do you experience notifications on other websites and on your phone? Are there some types of notifications that are difficult or impossible for you to interpret? Is there any website or app that does it particularly well from a colorblindness standpoint?

- *For magnicifcation participants - observe if they seem to notice links off to the right on desktop without being prompted. If they don't, direct them to where they are located*

***for colorblind participants - don't use the word red***
- What do you think each of these *red* dot indicators mean?

- How do you think each of these dots would disappear? 

- What would you expect to see if you clicked the link that says "Go to your inbox" when it has a red dot next to it?

- What would you expect to see if you clicked "Get your VA medical records and lab and test results" when it has a dot next to it?

- Is there anywhere on this view of the website that we're looking at now where you expect to see a *red* dot notification like this but you don't?

### Move onto badge indicator

Okay, I'm now going to [share with you another link in Zoom chat](https://bit.ly/4anyJ2j) that will take you to another version of this page. Please open it and continue sharing your screen. If you need any assistance with that, just let me know. 

*User shares screen*

What stands out to you first?
- *For colorblind participants* Do you have any trouble seeing the badge with the number in it? *If it's not clear whether they can or not* Can you read the number in it?

What do you think the badges with numbers in them means?

What would you expect to see if you clicked "Refill and track your prescriptions" when it has this numbered badge next to it?

How do you think badge with the number in it would disappear?

### __Move on to slim alert__

Ok, we have one more weblink to share with you. [Share link](https://bit.ly/4a6B7dk)

For this final part, I’d like for you to imagine you have recently filed for a new claim for compensation with the VA - you don’t need to be concerned about the other details of the claim for this exercise. 

- Direct them to the card. Okay, what do you think everything on this card means? What do you think you might have to do next?

- What do you think "We need more information from you" might mean?

- _Colorblind users_: Did you have any difficulty reading this alert, or seeing it in general?

- How do you think this alert would disappear?

If someone has filed a claim before/has a disability rating, ask if they ever were asked in the past to provide more evidence and inquire about that 
_(if they have never filed a claim before, move on)_

- Ask about what would be useful to learn ahead of time.

Are there other things with the VA you'd like to be notified of (through things like these dot indicators, emails, text messages, physical mail) that you aren't now, or things you are notified of but you don't think it's helpful enough?

### General notifications asks

Are there any experiences with notifications with other websites or apps that you've found to be helpful or really informative for you?

## Thanks and Closing - 2 minutes

Great, thank you so much. This has been really helpful for our team, and we appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. 

Do you have any questions or last thoughts for me before we end the session?

Thank you for your feedback and thank you so much again for joining us today. We really appreciate it.
