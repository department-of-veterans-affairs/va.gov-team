## Starting the session
- _Keep observers in waiting room to ask participant if they still consent to having observers in the session. Tell them to have their camera on with full name displayed for a brief introduction to participant when they are admitted to the session._
- _Check your screensharing setup and share permissions for participants._
- _When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro._

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Matt. Today we're going to be reviewing some new features being considered for the website VA.gov.

Before we dive into it, could you please verify if you'll be using a screen reader for the session?
- *If no, switch to [sighted user conversation guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/onsite-notifications/dot-indicator/research/2024-03%20Dot%20Indicator%20and%20Slim%20Alert%20Usability%20Study/dot-indicator-convo-guide.md).
- *If yes, ask:* Okay, what kind of screen reader is it, and what kind of computer are you on?

Okay, got it. Thank you! Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **I have a few other colleagues in the waiting room who would like to observe and take notes.** Are you okay with letting them in for this session?
	- _If participant does not consent, ask the observers to kindly leave the Zoom via Slack._
	- _If participant consents, let other observers into room and allow a short pause to say hello._ Here are some other members from our website team - if you'd all like to say a quick hello. And now for those of you who just joined, if you could please turn off your cameras to save bandwidth, that would be great.
 
- **This entire session should take no longer than 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you any longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic to keep us on schedule.

- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability; we are testing our work so you cannot do anything wrong here. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. As you go through the site, it'll be really helpful if you can think out loud as much as possible.
  
- **We will be using a made up account in a prototype of VA.gov today. It's not going to be your personal account, and the information that you'll navigate through is for testing purposes only.** I'll prompt you with some questions once we get started. Does that all sound okay to you?
 
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You don't need to say why, just say you need to go if you need to.**
  
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly and I will pause the recording while you are signing in so we don't capture any of that info.
  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**
  - If no: do not record.

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Research goal: Determine the accessibility implications of the dot or badge indicator - 30-45 minutes

To start off, how often do you visit VA.gov? What do you use the website for?

Do you know if you have a disability rating? If so, what is it? 

Okay, now I'm going to send you a weblink to take you to our prototype. We are using a tool called CodePen for this prototype, so if you hear any mention of it, that's totally normally and nothing to be concerned about.

Are you okay if I send this in Zoom's chat, or would you prefer to receive it another way, like email? (If they want email, contact Perigean)
- Alright I'm going to ask you to open the [link I've shared (via the method they prefer)](https://bit.ly/3TsleZe) and then share your screen with me. Let me know if you need any help doing that.

Great, I can see your screen. For this exercise, I'm going to ask for you to pretend that you've already signed into your __(or if they dont use the site, "a")__ VA account.

- *Once the full page has loaded* If a user of VA.gov: So imagining that you've logged in, how would you typically go about navigating the page?
	- If not a user: So imagining that you've logged in, how do you think you might go about navigating the page to learn more about your status with VA services?

- *Let them navigate down the page however they prefer. If they come across the links with indicators, ask:* What are the screen reader cues telling you about these links? How are you interpreting each of them? *Gauge whether the cues are stopping them in their tracks and seem important or are being ignored*
	- *If they did not navigate to the links with indicators, ask:* How would you find out if you have any unread health care messages?
	- *If they did not navigate to the links with indicators, ask:* How would you find out if you have new lab results to review?

- What would you expect to happen if you selected the link for "Go to your inbox" and it says **You have new messages**?

### Move on to badge indicators

I have another [link to share with you](https://bit.ly/3wMJtbU). This will take you to a different, slimmed down version of the same page. Again, if you need help, we're here to assist. 

- Can you navigate the page and tell me what you think as you hear what's on it?

- Which is more helpful for you: hearing the number of items that need your attention versus what you heard before on the previous version of the page, being told when there are updates for you but without specific numbers?
  
- How do you experience notifications on other websites and on your phone? Are there any experiences with notifications with other websites or apps that you've found to be helpful or really informative for you?
  
- How do you think each of these notifications that are being read to you would no longer be there?

### Move on to slim alert banner

Ok, we have one more weblink to share with you. [Share link](https://bit.ly/4a6B7dk). Again, if you need help, we're here to assist. 

For this final part, I’d like for you to imagine you have recently filed for a new claim for compensation with the VA - you don’t need to be concerned about the other details of the claim for this exercise. 

How would you go about finding the status of your claim on this page?

   -  If they find the card: Okay, what do you think all this info about the claim means? What do you think you might have to do next for the claim?

   -  When you hear "We need more information from you", what do you think that could include?

_If relevant_: Thinking back on when you filed any claims in the past, with any evidence requests, was there anything that would’ve been helpful to know beforehand for providing evidence?

Are there other things with the VA you'd like to be notified of (through things read to you like the notifications we just ran through, or other ways like texts or emails) that you aren't now, or things you are notified of but you don't think it's helpful enough?


## Thanks and Closing - 2 minutes

Great, thank you so much. This has been really helpful for our team, and we appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. 

Do you have any questions or last thoughts for me before we end the session?

Thank you for your feedback and thank you so much again for joining us today. We really appreciate it.
