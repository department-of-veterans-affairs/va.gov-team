## Research Goals
_First, set the context of this research by explaining how it fits into the Veteran’s journey. Explain what a Veteran might do before and after using this tool. What moments does this tool live in? Are there moments that matter to keep in mind? What are Veteran’s familiarity with tools like this? (do they use tools like this, or is this something new)._
