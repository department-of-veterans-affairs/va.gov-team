## Starting the session
- _Keep observers in waiting room to ask participant if they still consent to having observers in the session. Tell them to have their camera on with full name displayed for a brief introduction to participant when they are admitted to the session._
- _Check your screensharing setup and share permissions for participants._
- _When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro._

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Matt. Today we're going to be reviewing some new features being considered for VA.gov.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **I have a few other colleagues in the waiting room who would like to observe and take notes.** Are you okay with letting them in for this session?
	- _If participant does not consent, ask the observers to kindly leave the Zoom via Slack._
	- _If participant consents, let other observers into room and allow a short pause to say hello._ Here are some other members from our website team - if you'd all like to say a quick hello. And now for those of you who just joined, if you could please turn off your cameras to save bandwidth, that would be great.
- **This entire session should take no longer than 30 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you any longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic to keep us on schedule.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability; we are testing our work so you cannot do anything wrong here. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. As you go through the site, it'll be really helpful if you can think out loud as much as possible.
- **We will be looking at a made up account in VA.gov today. It's not going to be your personal account, and the information that you see is for testing purposes only.** I'll prompt you with questions and actions to take once you've logged in to the test account. Does that all sound okay to you?
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly and I will pause the recording while you are signing in so we don't capture any of that info.
  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Research goal: Determine the effectiveness of dot and badge indicators to draw attention to important updates and when it's appropriate to use each kind of indicator. - 15-20 minutes

Now I'm going to ask you to open the link I've shared with you in Zoom chat, and then for you to share your screen with me. Let me know if you need any help doing that.

Okay great, I can see your screen. Now please click the "sign in" button in the top right corner and I'll put the credentials you should use to log in in the chat. 

- *Once the full page has loaded* Now that you've logged in, what's standing out to you first?
- *If they don't mention the indicators* Go to the Health care section. 

- *For colorblind participants* Do you have any trouble seeing the dot? What color do they appear to be to you?
- *For colorblind participants* How do you experience notifications on other websites and on your phone? Are there some types of notifications that are difficult or impossible for you to interpret? Is there any website or app that does it particularly well from a colorblindness standpoint?

- *For magnicifcation participants - observe if they seem to notice links off to the right on desktop without being prompted. If they don't, direct them to where they are located*

*for colorblind participants - don't use the word red*
- What do you think each of these *red* dot indicators mean?

- How do you think each of these dots would disappear? 

- What would you expect to see if you clicked the link that says "Go to your inbox" when it has a red dot next to it?

- What would you expect to see if you clicked "Get your VA medical records and lab and test results" when it has a dot next to it?

- Is there anywhere on this view of the website that we're looking at now where you expect to see a *red* dot notification like this but you don't?


__Move on to badge indicator__

Okay, I'm now going to share with you another link in Zoom chat that will take you to another version of this page. Please open it and continue sharing your screen. If you need any assistance with that, just let me know. 

*User shares screen*

What stands out to you first?
- *For colorblind participants* Do you have any trouble seeing the badge with the number in it? *If it's not clear whether they can or not* Can you read the number in it?

What do you think the badge with the number in it means?

What would you expect to see if you clicked "Refill and track your prescriptions" when it has this numbered badge next to it?

How do you think badge with the number in it would disappear?
