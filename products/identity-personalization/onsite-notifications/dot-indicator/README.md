## Overview

The dot indicator is a notification style that aims to call a user's attention to unread messages. 

## Problem statement

- As a VA.gov user, I want to be able to easily see items that require my attention or action when I log into the website.

## User Outcomes

### Desired User Outcomes

- Users will more easily be able to find items that need their attention.

### Undesired User Outcomes

- Done wrong, the dot indicator would be easily missed by users.

## Business Outcomes

### Desired Business Outcomes

- The dot indicator is simple and easily scalable as an attention mechanism.

### Undesired Business Outcomes

- The dot indicator becomes overly or improperly used
