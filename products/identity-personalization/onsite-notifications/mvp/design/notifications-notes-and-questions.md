# Notifications notes and questions
Last updated: November 2, 2021

## Things we need to figure out
- How do we account for cancelled appointments?

## Things we have figured out

- We need to cap the notifications archive at 6 months or a year (Tressa will figure this out).
- When we first launch there will *not* be a historical backlog, so no need to implement filtering for MVP.
- We need to have a blank state for everything.
- We can show time sensitive/priority notifications.
- We want more personalization than what VA notify currently shows.
