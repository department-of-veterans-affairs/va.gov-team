## Initial planning/strategy questions:

| Question | Answer |
|------|-------|
|1. When will My VA team's work be done?| Targeting end of current sprint (by 5/31). Taylor is wrapping his FE work ([#36034](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/36034), [#40710](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/40710), [#41482](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/41482)), Tom has one ticket ([#41268](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/41268)) to complete that will enable VA Notifty to be able to complete connectivity testing with our API.|
|2. When will VA Notify's work be done?| Targeting by end of their current sprint which ends 5/27. They need Tom to complete [#41268](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/41268) (See above). |
|3. Does VA Notify need to be part of this? If so, who on their team should participate?| Yes, sounds like they should. According to Melanie they'd like to have their QA person involved (see POC table above). |
|4. Does Tze need to be part of this? If so, what does he need to do? Or can he just take a look at things once the notification has already been sent?| Yes, as a "QA Shift-left" task to assist in test-strategy during development &mdash; meeting scheduled for Wed 5/25 |


## Technical/Functional questions:

| Question | Answer |
|------|-------|
|1. What use cases do we need to test (single notification, multiple notifications, etc)? We'll want this so we can make sure the backend team sends us exactly what they need.|[On-site notification test cases](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/blob/master/Administrative/vagov-users/staging-test-accounts-onsite-notification.md) |
|2. For QA on Staging, how many test accounts do we need to set up?|Tze needs 10 accounts (ideally; min 6) preset with 1 notification each, and 10 (ideally, min 6) with 3 notifications.  These can be done before QA starts.  For the [live-update-after-dismissal test-case](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/blob/master/Administrative/vagov-users/staging-test-accounts-onsite-notification.md#user-content-casec), the single-notification accounts will also need to have a new notification added to each, after Tze has dismissed the preset notifications.

|3. What does the backend team need from us in order to add debts for our staging users?| They need the "file number" for each user, which is almost always the SSN for the user. We have SSNs for our staging users, so we can get the SSNs to the backend team before our end-to-end testing.|
