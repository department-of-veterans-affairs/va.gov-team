# Apr 26, 2022 | VA Notify/AE My VA - Bi-weekly Sync
#### Attendees:  Melanie Jones, AJ, Tom Harrison, Zachary Law, Samara Strauss, Liz Lantz, Angela Agosto, Beverly Nelson, Erica Sauve, Taylor Mitchell, Jake Uhteg

## Agenda
1. Questions from Angela for discussion (see below)
2. Questions about payment notifications on My VA from VA Notify team

### Questions for discussion with VA Notify  as a result of conversation with Debt Resolution team
1. Will we be able to receive data that tells us the date of a debt notification? If we do, that would enable us to set a time limit on it so it wouldn’t stay on a veteran’s My VA view forever if they didn’t dismiss it themselves. (Not an MVP feature)
   Answer: since the notification is sent to VA Notify whenever it's needed that would essentially always be the current date you receive the onsite notification trigger. Can you use the processed date (today's date) as that value? (Processed date = date notification is received, need to look into this as a possibility)

2. Discussion that may need to be had between backend engineer and VA Notify - is there a way we can dismiss a debt notification if it is paid? 
    Answer: no we can't, only the veteran can dismiss the notification
