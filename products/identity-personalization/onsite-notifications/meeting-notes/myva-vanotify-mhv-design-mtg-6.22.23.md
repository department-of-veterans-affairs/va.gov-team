### Notes
- Question from Florence: eventually NC is accessible via menu nav and a badge, wondering if once that happens would that change the UX on My VA?
- Question from Patrick/Ryan: Use of "importance" icons - concerned about VA defining what's "important" for the user


### Next steps
- Technical overview scheduled for 6/29: VA notify system overview, how the debt notification mvp works, how does MHV on VA.gov come into the fold, etc.
- PM's to discuss logisitcs i.e. planning timelines and collab cycle coordination

- [Notification Center discovery](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/onsite-notifications/2023-scaling-onsite-notifications/notification-center-discovery/scaling-onsite-notifications-stakeholder-research-findings.md) _findings from conversations with OCTO stakeholders around VA.gov notification center_
