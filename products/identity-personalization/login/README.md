## Additional Notes

* For localhost authentication, crypto is disabled by default. If you wish to enable crypto, you must acquire the `saml-rp.vetsgov.localhost` key and certificate which is located in credstash under `vets_api.localhost.idme_key` & `vets_api.localhost.idme_cert` - ask in `#vsp-operations` slack channel for access.
* If you want to know a heck of a lot of details about MVI (Master Veteran Index), the [MVI Integration]() directory is the place to look.
* How to [add someone to MVI]()
* It is highly recommended that everyone on the VA.gov team attempts to identity proof themselves so that they can login to VA.gov in a production system. Identity proofing is available to everyone, independent of Veteran status.  If you are not a Veteran, you will not be matched in MVI but that's the expected behavior! You will simply not be able to see Veteran-specific items (e.g. secure messaging, Rx refills, etc.)
* To navigate VA.gov as an LOA3 identity proofed Veteran:
  * Pick a test account from [this table](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/blob/master/Administrative/mvi-staging-users.csv) (scroll to the right for user/password columns)
  * Visit https://staging.va.gov (HTTP auth username is `veterans` and password is `am3rica`)
  * Click "Sign In"
  * Enter your chosen user/password in the ID.me dialog and click "Sign In"
  * On the "Confirm your identity" page, click "Continue" (you can leave "Text message" selected; this connect to the staging environment and is configured so no one will be messaged)
  * You should see a 6-digit confirmation automatically entered for you; click "Continue"
  * On the "VA.gov SAML Consumer" page, click "Allow"
  * You should now be logged in as an LOA3 identity proofed Veteran with an entry in MVI that allows you to see information for Veteran-specific items (e.g. secure messaging, Rx refills, etc)
