## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Lauryl Zenobi and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about your experiences setting up VA accounts and logging into VA websites. Specifically, we’re interested in your experiences with DS Logon. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?**

## Warm-up Questions

Let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

- What VA websites or application do you access online? How do you login to each of those websites?
  - MHV, eBenefits
    - I’m not the one who logs into eBen; I watch him while he does that
    - MHV we log in on the site
    - Caregiver-wise, we’re supposed to have our own access but we don’t
      - It isn’t supposed to be just under his name; he’s supposed to be able to login and look but I’m supposed to be able to log in under my own name on MHV
    - On DS Logon, he can get in some days but some days he can’t
      - It basically makes him reset everything, or he has to wait and go through the verification process again
        - It’ll make him change the login and the password but he has to call somebody. Most of the time he’s not up to that so it just dangles until I notice that we need it for something
      - You’re supposed to be able to verify online but [they’ve taken away remote proofing]
  - He’s been able to do it by calling
        - There have been issues where he’s able to see other people’s information and he’s afraid other people can see his
          - Another veteran’s information came up when he entered his logon
          - He says “I don’t know if I want my stuff in here” but I say “We have to use it, they’re expecting us to use it”
    - We’re not able to communicate with anyone but his PCP [on MHV]
      - It says all of his providers are not set up on the system. They say they are, but I don’t know if they’re not listed to him or if they’re not as fully set up as they think they are
      - I think they get contact with some people but when they try to send us a message they get the response “the veteran’s not available”
    - We log in to MHV a couple times a month and DS Logon about once a month
      - We double-check appointments
- Are there VA services or benefits that you are unable to access online?

## Credentialing processes

- How did you get your login account(s)? Can you walk me through that process?
- Did you have to do identify verification? What was that process like?
- Have you had to get multiple types of accounts for logging into VA sites?
  - I think [my husband] has but not me
  - I already have two email accounts
    - This makes it very difficult to keep up
    - He forgets what he does, he’ll open up a new one and not be sure what he did
- What was an instance where you needed to set up another account?
- What has been your experience with DS Logon? ID.me? My HealtheVet? With other types of accounts?
  - It’s frustrating. It’s a good platform and I think it can work and it should work
  - I see this work for other large hospital systems
  - I’m not sure why this is more frustrating than that would be
  - Everytime we need something we feel like if we see it, we need to print it, because it might not be there when we come back
  - It doesn’t eliminate our need for paper, I wish it could
  - My husband can sort of do it on his phone, but most of the time it doesn’t work on his phone so he says forget it I’ll just do it on the laptop
    - He clicks on links and they don’t open effectively
    - Different functions don’t seem to work on his phone
    - I’ve heard him say four or five times “forget it! I’ll just do it on the computer!”
- What level of trust do you have with these logins?
  - [DS Logon] is not one that we’re super trusting of 
    - When we were supposed to be setting it up so that both of us could use it he was having a lot of paranoia and he was in and out of hospitals
    - Just this week we tried to get the doctor to send me something but I didn’t have access, even though the coordinator told me I was supposed to
- As an active-duty service member, what sort of online account(s) did you have? How does the VA account process compare to other online accounts that you’ve set up?

## Log-on processes

- Would you be comfortable with screen-sharing your login process with me and talking me through how you login?
- Which VA site do you log into most often?
- [For veterans] Do you have others that log on for you (like a care-giver or a VCO)? Tell me about some instances when you would have someone log in for you. 
- Have you ever worked with a VCO/VCO representative? Why? What was that process like?
  - She said she could help us with it but I have not been able to do it
- [For care-givers] Are there instances where you’ll use someone else’s login? Tell me about that process.
- When you log in, are there multiple options for how to log in? If so, which do you use? Why do you choose that option?
- Have you ever found yourself unable to log in?
  - Last time it was down was in July, for a day or two
  - It hasn’t been down as often as MHV
- How often does this occur? 
- What do you do when this happens?
- Once you provide your login credentials, are you asked to provide a second form of authentication, like a code sent to your phone or email? What do you think of that?

## Final questions
 
- If you had a magic wand and could change something about the process of getting a VA account or logging in, what would it be?
  - I’d like it to be able to work a little more effectively
  - I appreciate the security aspect of it
  - I’m worried about the anomalies that there are
  - We got a letter that our information had been breached
  - He has a lot of anxiety about [security] 
  - There’s a huge flap about security in the VA at the same time that it can be so incredibly hard to access your own information -- it seems like it’s easier for nefarious people to get it than it is for us to get to our own information
  - It feels like it’s not keeping up with the times, it doesn’t feel like it’s even close for any of the medical care we get in other places
  - I would love to be able to chat at any hour because if you call for help you’re on hold waiting and waiting and waiting
  - By the time you add up all these things [that make you wait] over the course of the week it’s really frustrating
  - This is why he opts out of handling this -- if he’s on hold for ten minutes it becomes my problem
  - I don’t have the ability to sit on hold endlessly anyway
  - The point of this was to make it easier because the doctors are busy too
  - We haven’t been able to get the device he needs because he’s in pain for 94 days because we haven’t been able to put the information we needed to put in MHV
    - His pain is through the roof and I’m struggling to reach people in their offices
    - This doesn’t happen anywhere else in the world. This is VA-specific
    - This is where it really needs to work
  - Especially on MHV, when you got to FAQ and there’s a long list of all the error codes, that speaks volumes to what the end user experience is like
- Is there anything we haven’t talked about today that you think I should know?
- Any questions for me? 

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
