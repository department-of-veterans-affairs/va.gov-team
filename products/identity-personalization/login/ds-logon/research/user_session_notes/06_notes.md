## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Lauryl Zenobi and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about your experiences setting up VA accounts and logging into VA websites. Specifically, we’re interested in your experiences with DS Logon. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**

- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?**

## Warm-up Questions

Let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

- What VA websites or application do you access online? How do you login to each of those websites? 
  - MHV and eBenefits
    - On MHV I use the MHV user ID
    - My husband suffered a traumatic brain injury so I got a login for him
      - He can’t visually track websites like this with his brain injury
      - Because he was getting so much care initially when he was discharged we got the enhanced login
      - I don’t feel like people hack me to get in here, there’s no financial gain at all
      - I don’t deal with any of this nonsense over here. I already have this [password] saved and I’m lazy and I have a million other things to do
      - DS Logon takes a million letters and your first person’s kidney to log in
- Are there VA services or benefits that you are unable to access online?
 
## Credentialing processes

- How did you get your login account(s)? Can you walk me through that process?
  - [for Premium login] When you’re at the hospital, print this out and bring it in and someone will do something administrative and it’ll work
  - I have ID.me but I don’t bother with that
  - “In the caregiver world, something that’s done is more precious than gold”
    - Why do I want to mess with a bunch of logins and passwords that’s just a lot of frustration
  - eBenefits was a long time ago
- Did you have to do identify verification? What was that process like?
- Have you had to get multiple types of accounts for logging into VA sites?
- What was an instance where you needed to set up another account?
- What has been your experience with DS Logon? ID.me? My HealtheVet? With other types of accounts?
  - I haven’t been on [eBenefits] in a while so it will be surprising to me if I can get in, just because I know they’ve been changing it
  - I’ve never used ID.me on MHV before
    - It sent an email to verify my email before I log on. Security, I get it
    - [seeing 2FA screen] oh boy. No I don’t want to do all that crap
    - I think it’s three steps too many. I was fortunate I had my ID.me stuff saved so I didn’t have to look through all my passwords
    - [seeing identity verification] I’m not going through all this crap, sorry
      - I didn’t have to do any of this because they saw us face-to-face at the VA
- What level of trust do you have with these logins?
- As an active-duty service member, what sort of online account(s) did you have? How does the VA account process compare to other online accounts that you’ve set up?

## Log-on processes

- Would you be comfortable with screen-sharing your login process with me and talking me through how you login?
  - [sees page full of red text] oh crap
  - I have to pull of the 25-digit BS combo they make you have
    - This is the frustrating stuff
  - I have a whole vault of passwords I keep because I used to mentally track them all and I can’t 
    - I use onenote, that way it’s on my phone and computer and everywhere I need
  - It seems like every time I want to use it [it prompts me to change my password]
  - Sometimes I’ll change it and I’ll save it but it’ll revert back to the old one
  - Can you imagine being a veteran with TBI who hasn’t slept all night long and then he gets some snarky person on the phone who tells him he has to go to eBenefits? A single veteran without a spouse or caregiver would probably break his PC
  - [sees requirements on password change page] Here we go!
  - “Why am I getting this crap? Just log me in.”
  - [After navigating to VA Letters section] I should already be logged in, but it looks like it’s making me log in again
  - Often if I click the back button it logs me out
  - [This benefit letter] would have been my husband’s undoing, and he’s a smart guy
- Which VA site do you log into most often?
- [For veterans] Do you have others that log on for you (like a care-giver or a VCO)? Tell me about some instances when you would have someone log in for you. 
- Have you ever worked with a VCO/VCO representative? Why? What was that process like?
  - No, this [research session] is the first time I’ve ever talked to you guys
- [For care-givers] Are there instances where you’ll use someone else’s login? Tell me about that process.
- When you log in, are there multiple options for how to log in? If so, which do you use? Why do you choose that option?
  - There’s gotta be a way to make this easier. I understand that these sites are run by different vendors but it should be more seamless
  - If you’re already looking for ways out, and you go to log in and you’re tired and exhausted … not everyone’s healthy mentally or physically, and sleep deprivation really does play into your ability to focus and key in that right password and login information
- Have you ever found yourself unable to log in?
  - Once in a blue moon I’ve tried to log in and they’re doing updates. I understand that the VA is trying to improve things but it’s just taking a while
- How often does this occur? 
- What do you do when this happens?
- Once you provide your login credentials, are you asked to provide a second form of authentication, like a code sent to your phone or email? What do you think of that?

## Final questions

- If you had a magic wand and could change something about the process of getting a VA account or logging in, what would it be?
  - Make the password stuff a little less … there’s a lot of clutter on that page and there needs to be more whitespace. I’m looking at it from the perspective of someone who’s looking at it with extreme fatigue, possibly brain injury
- Is there anything we haven’t talked about today that you think I should know?
  - I think the big takeaway is make one password, one sign-on that goes through all this stuff. I know that’s not always possible when it directs you to another vendor, but more information that’s clearer and bolder to give these guys more information of what they’re actually clicking into
  - They need to simplify their terms
  - Simplify the process. I know when the DoD is involved it’s an extra pain in the ass, but they need to understand that people need to access their benefits in an easier, less frustrating way
- Any questions for me? 
  - This is one step in a lot of steps needed to make this more approachable

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
