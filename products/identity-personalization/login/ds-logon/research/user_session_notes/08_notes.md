## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Lauryl Zenobi and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about your experiences setting up VA accounts and logging into VA websites. Specifically, we’re interested in your experiences with DS Logon. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?**

## Warm-up Questions

Let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

- What VA websites or application do you access online? How do you login to each of those websites?
  - MHV, eBenefits, DoD login for MyAccess and MyPay
  - I use my husband’s logins
  - I use MHV daily 
  - I use eBenefits a couple times a month (any time we need to file anything)
  - We use MyPay a couple times a year; if everything’s going correctly we don’t touch it
  - It’s challenging because MHV, eBen, and MyPay all do similar things, but you have to go to each one separately to do different things
    - In order to get records on MHV, you need to start the claim on eBen and complete it before you can make the appointment
- Are there VA services or benefits that you are unable to access online?

## Credentialing processes

- How did you get your login account(s)? Can you walk me through that process?
  - For us it was challenging because my husband’s account had to keep being authorized
  - It took probably two years to get his MHV account authorized [for Premium]
  - We finally had to go to the medical records office and he was able to push a button right there in his office and we had access to everything
  - Theoretically they give you a login and you’re supposed to be able to log in with the code they give you, but to switch it to the Premium you have to do separate steps to get it upgraded to where you can actually do things online
  - Before we had the Advanced account … if you have a Basic account you have to switch off of that to be able to do anything
  - On DS Logon we have to redo the password every 60 or 90 days, so if you forget it, which kept happening to my husband, you have to reset the whole thing just to reset the 60-90 day renewal
  - I have a spreadsheet where I put the start and finish of the password and I can remember the middle. Usually I try to pick something relevant to us. You have to do so many letters, numbers, symbols usually you have to pick something that’s not easy to remember
  - You have to be authorized for Premium on MHV if you want to be Premium on eBenefits, which then makes it difficult to put in any claims or see the documents you need 
  - I think they just recently upgraded the system to have the Advanced option
- Did you have to do identify verification? What was that process like?
- Have you had to get multiple types of accounts for logging into VA sites?
  - I have seven accounts 
    - Certain ones do certain things: eBen is for compensation claims, disabilities; MHV is pretty much all medical; myPay is basically for finding your pay stubs
  - My husband used to write his passwords down on pieces of paper but he’d lose them
  - I use a spreadsheet
- What was an instance where you needed to set up another account?
- What has been your experience with DS Logon? ID.me? My HealtheVet? With other types of accounts?
- What level of trust do you have with these logins?
- As an active-duty service member, what sort of online account(s) did you have? How does the VA account process compare to other online accounts that you’ve set up?

## Log-on processes

- Would you be comfortable with screen-sharing your login process with me and talking me through how you login?
- Which VA site do you log into most often?
- [For veterans] Do you have others that log on for you (like a care-giver or a VCO)? Tell me about some instances when you would have someone log in for you. 
- Have you ever worked with a VCO/VCO representative? Why? What was that process like?
- [For care-givers] Are there instances where you’ll use someone else’s login? Tell me about that process.
- When you log in, are there multiple options for how to log in? If so, which do you use? Why do you choose that option?
  - On MHV, use MHV user ID
    - Typically I’m on my phone so I don’t have to do this one too often
    - I have it logged in on my phone already
    - It’s a little harder to do it on the desktop
  - On eBenefits
    - We don’t have a CAC card so we login with DS Logon
    - I’ve done this so many times my computer has it saved
- Have you ever found yourself unable to log in?
  - [MHV] It’ll give an error code stating that website upgrades are being made, but usually it’s not on the date that is says it’s going to be
    - I just have to wait until it comes back up again
    - Happens every other month or so
  - [eBenefits] They have the outage calendar but typically the dates aren’t exact. For example this outage is ongoing for a year
    - If I’m on here 7 times, about 3 of them will be delayed [due to errors]
    - I’ve tried calling in but I end up on hold for 2-3 hours
    - There’s the contact button at the top of the page but no one ever answers
    - With the online chat, they’re quick to answer the first message but then it’ll be 4-5 minutes between messages or they’ll tell me I need to call in
    - Our closest benefits office is about two hours away so in-person is not an easy option for us
  - [MyPay] It usually takes a few tries before it’ll go
    - Pretty much every time I get an error
- How often does this occur? 
- What do you do when this happens?
- Once you provide your login credentials, are you asked to provide a second form of authentication, like a code sent to your phone or email? What do you think of that?
  - No; once you’re in, you’re in

## Final questions

- If you had a magic wand and could change something about the process of getting a VA account or logging in, what would it be?
  - Streamline all this into one spot to see everything, so there’s not seven different logins or seven different portals you have to go through to see everything
  - At this point I get confused on which one to use for which problem
  - There are three that use a separate login from the DoD login
  - So if we could streamline that to have a central location for everything, that would make it much easier
  - My spreadsheet includes what each site is meant to accomplish so I can decide which one to use
- Is there anything we haven’t talked about today that you think I should know?
  - Having the pharmacy dates correct; the refill submit dates are different from the fill dates
- Any questions for me? 

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
