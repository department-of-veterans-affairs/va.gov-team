## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Lauryl Zenobi and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about your experiences setting up VA accounts and logging into VA websites. Specifically, we’re interested in your experiences with DS Logon. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?**

## Warm-up Questions

Let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

- What VA websites or application do you access online? How do you login to each of those websites? 
  - MHV, “the VA benefits one” [va.gov]
  - On MHV, sign in with the MHV user ID
    - It’s front and center for me. I’ve never used any of the others before
    - I honestly didn’t know there was another way to do it
  - On VA.gov, sign in with MHV
    - That’s the only way I know how to log in
  - I’ve used eBenefits, but only a couple times a year, usually to pull up his compensation letter
    - When I do it’s very difficult to navigate
    - I have to refer back to some notes I have saved to know how to navigate it
    - I really don’t like this website as well. It’s so difficult
      - All the options can be overwhelming
      - Trying to figure out which feature I need and what information I can find
- Are there VA services or benefits that you are unable to access online?
  - Would be nice to see the images from x-rays or MRIs

## Credentialing processes

- How did you get your login account(s)? Can you walk me through that process?
  - [MHV] Years ago he did it and I took over for him
    - Honestly it was probably through a google search, that’s how we find most of our information. Very little information has come from the VA itself
    - I use a lot of forums, facebook groups, youtube videos
  - [eBenefits] I don’t think it was too difficult; if I remember correctly I think they may have had to mail something to us with a code. It did take some time
    - It was so long ago
- Did you have to do identify verification? What was that process like?
  - [eBenefits] I don’t think so besides putting in your social and birthday as normal
  - I honestly can’t remember
- Have you had to get multiple types of accounts for logging into VA sites?
- What was an instance where you needed to set up another account?
- What has been your experience with DS Logon? ID.me? My HealtheVet? With other types of accounts?
- What level of trust do you have with these logins?
  - It’s habit; [I choose how to login] because that’s how he did it, so it’s how I do it
  - Being a VA website, I tend to think it’s more secure, and I know my computer is secure
    - Maybe I would feel differently if I were on a public computer
  - If it’s the same IP address I’m logging in with each time you shouldn’t have to continually ask me who I am
- As an active-duty service member, what sort of online account(s) did you have? How does the VA account process compare to other online accounts that you’ve set up?

## Log-on processes

- Would you be comfortable with screen-sharing your login process with me and talking me through how you login?
- Which VA site do you log into most often?
- [For veterans] Do you have others that log on for you (like a care-giver or a VCO)? Tell me about some instances when you would have someone log in for you. 
- Have you ever worked with a VCO/VCO representative? Why? What was that process like?
  - We had a VSO when we were in [our last residence] and he emailed me the forms, that was the only communication I had with him
      - Didn’t have anything to do with online accounts, just trying to get help with disability claims. He was emailing me forms so he could submit it on our behalf
  - The folks in [our local VAMC] have never mentioned any help with navigating the sites
- [For care-givers] Are there instances where you’ll use someone else’s login? Tell me about that process.
- When you log in, are there multiple options for how to log in? If so, which do you use? Why do you choose that option?
  - [logging in with DS Logon on VA.gov] We haven’t used this before
    - Confirmation email
      - This seems like an extra security step. If this is just because it’s the first time I’m logging in that’s fine, but if it asks me to do this every time I would be very irritated because it’s time consuming.
      - Being a mom and a caregiver, usually if I’m logging in I need to see something immediately
      - It seems pointless; this is my computer you should know me …. I don’t need that additional security
      - I still haven’t gotten that email, so if I were trying to login with this I would close this out already and [do another choice]
    - I’ll make the easiest choice to get in, and on this page that’s MHV
    - We like short and sweet; I want to get in and get out
- Have you ever found yourself unable to log in?
  - Yes [both MHV and eBenefits]
  - [eBenefits] sometimes it errors out or the website is down
    - About a week ago we tried all day and couldn’t get in so we just gave up for the day
    - Depending on my day I’ll come back later on and check
    - Normally we just say “oh, it’s the VA!” and try again the next day
- How often does this occur? 
  - Probably once a week
- What do you do when this happens?
  - I get on the phone, which is very difficult because they’re in from 7am-3:30pm
  - If I can’t get them on the phone I wait until the next day
- Once you provide your login credentials, are you asked to provide a second form of authentication, like a code sent to your phone or email? What do you think of that?
  - MHV has text code set up, a security thing. I haven’t seen that in a while. Normally we log in from our phones, so it’s possible that since it’s on the computer it didn’t recognize the IP address. I like to protect the information as much as possible so I like that extra added security.

## Final questions
 
- If you had a magic wand and could change something about the process of getting a VA account or logging in, what would it be?
  - It would be nice if *I* could log in
  - Being a caregiver it would be nice if I could see if he’s messaged someone
  - A lot of times I have to ask him “have you done this? Have you done this?” it would be nice to have my own login so I could see what the doctors are saying
  - My own little VA website that has information that we need
  - I’m usually the one to log in because he just gets angry
  - I know that there are a lot of programs out there, there’s a lot of information out there in regards to assistance, different research programs or even telehealth, but it’s so spread out
  - It would be nice if there were a website that compiled all of that instead of us trying to research it or another caregiver friend telling us about it. It would be nice if it were on a site just for caregivers
  - It would be nice to be able to log in at night if I can’t sleep because I’m so worried about this
- Is there anything we haven’t talked about today that you think I should know?
  - It is difficult to navigate
  - If VA.gov and eBenefits were combined into one maybe that would be more helpful but it would probably be SUPER overwhelming
- Any questions for me? 

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
