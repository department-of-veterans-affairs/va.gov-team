# Research Plan for MCT logon systems, September 18 2019

## Goals
1. What product & team are you doing this research for?
- Credentialing and logon systems, VA VEO, Multi-Channel Technologies (MCT)

2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? 
- Currently there are three primary ways veterans can login to VA digital properties: DS Logon, ID.me, and My HealtheVet. Each have different credentialing requirements, levels of security, and ease of user experience, and different VA digital properties use different login systems. This means veterans must go through several different credentialing processes to get access to the benefits they’ve earned, and are unable to have one seamless experience. Secondarily, veteran caregivers and beneficiaries are not able to create their own accounts at all, and must use a veteran’s login to access their benefits.

3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research?
- What kind of access does each user group require?
- What kind of access are they currently able to gain, and how?
- How many different processes does a single user go through to get the access they need?

4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research?
- Our goal is to understand the existing credentialing and logon process and find areas for improvement to the user experience.

## Method
1. What method of research are you planning? 
- Directed interviews
- Remote interviews
  
2. Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions?
- Interviewing users about their experience will help us understand the processes they go through and their feelings about it.

3. Where are you planning to do your research?
- Remote sessions using approved screen-sharing and recording software.

4. What will you be testing?
- The entire credentialing and logon process, focusing on DS Logon

5. If remote: What tool do you plan to use (Zoom, GoToMeeting, Webex)
- Zoom (Assuming it’s approved)
