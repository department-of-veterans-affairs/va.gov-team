# Research Plan for [Identity, VA.gov login process, June 2021]
As a designer I need to create a research plan to share with my team.	(This should be filled out and maintained by the designer on the team & can be cross-linked and referenced in any issues.) 	
## Goals	
1. What product & team are you doing this research for?	
  - This research is for Office of the CTO - Digital Experience (OCTODE)- Identity Team Leads for VA.gov. With this research the Identity team hopes to understand how and why users are currently using log in to VA.gov (MHV, DSLogon, ID.Me). Also what the impact of potentially sunsetting providers such as MHV and DSLogon will be. 
2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product?
  - VA.gov aims to provide a unified digital portal with access to all VA services. In certain instances, however, Veterans are directed out of the VA.gov platform in order to message their healthcare provider (MHV), check on the status of benefits claims (eBenefits), or access health tools that have moved to My VA Health (Cerner).  VA.gov, MHV, and eBenefits each have separate but overlapping login flows. With VA.gov and MHV, users have the option to log in using one of 3 credentials: ID.me (a third party identity provider), MHV's native credential, or DS Logon (an authentication system run by DoD). Login to eBenefits occurs solely through the DS Logon credential.  While users must navigate between multiple platforms to access benefits and tools (VA.gov to eBenefits, MHV, or My VA Health), in most cases they are asked to re-authenticate each time. This results in a fragmented experience that may discourage users from interacting with the VA online.  Our goal with this research is to gain insight into the user login experience.  With the data we collect we aim to lower the barriers of entry to accessing digital services and improve overall satisfaction of users on VA.gov. 	
3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research?
We will be attempting to answer some (not all) of the below research questions, accounting for time:
## Questions
1. What research currently exists?
2. What is the current experience for veterans logging in to VA.gov?
3. What usability issues does the design of the sign-in modal present for Veterans?
4. Do Veterans know where to go to get help?
5. What technical issues are they encountering?
6. Do users have a preference of how-to login and why?
7. What tasks do they typically log in for? Where do they typically log in to complete that task?
8. What are the risks of consolidating to just Login.gov and ID.me?
9. What trust issues should we consider as it relates to the current credential options?
10. What are the potential trust issues with login.gov?
11. What are the pain points with identity proofing? 
 	
## Hypothesis
1. What is your hypothesis for this research?
  - We believe that by narrowing down the VA.gov sign in options to two providers, will lead to less frustrating login experience and fewer abandoned sessions. 	 	
## Method	
1. What method of research are you planning?
  - Remote moderated directed interviews
  - Remote moderated usability testing with current Va.gov site and low- or high-fidelity mockups 
2. Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions?
  - To understand and document top pain points veterans currently have with the login process and how the addition/removal of buttons will affect them.
3. Where are you planning to do your research? If in person, mention the location, point of contact, arrangements, etc. If online, mention which tool you'll be using (GTM, Join.me, etc.)
  - Remotely, using Perigean's zoom account.
4. What will you be testing? (Design mocks, card sort, prototype, page, content, etc.)
  - VA.gov sign-in modal
  - Design mocks with addition/removal of Login.gov button	
  - Screen after sign-on where we invite them to create a Login.gov account
## Participants and Recruitment	
1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?
(Mention: Number of people, ages, accessibility preferences, geographical diversity, login requirements, VA benefit requirements, familiarity with technology, etc. Keep in mind, the more requirements, the more difficult the recruit, so give ample time to ensure the right participant mix.)
  - Ideally, we'd like to have 5-7 fulfilled sessions - please recruit 10 veterans to make sure we have the desired number. 	

Please list your participant criteria in two categories-
1. **Primary criteria / Must have**
- At least three participants from DSLogon, MHV, ID.Me
- At least one participant that uses primarily mobile to access VA.gov via mobile browser
- At least half of participants who have logged in and:
  - Sent a secure message OR
  - Tracked claim status OR
  - Changed direct deposit

2. **Secondary criteria / Would like to have** - what other criteria would strengthen your results?
  - At least one person under the age of 30, and at least one person over the age of 55
  - At least one non-veteran (i.e: dependent or beneficiary)
  - At least one person with a disability rating of 70% or greater
  - At least two women
  - At least two people persons of color (POC)
  - At least one person that does not have a college degree 
  - At least one person that has a college degree
  - At least one person who lives in a rural or remote area
3. **Recruitment Strategy** 
What is your recruitment strategy? 
  - We'll leverage Perigean to recruit participants.
