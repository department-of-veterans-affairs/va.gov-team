## Introduction- 5 minutes 
Thanks for joining us today! My name is Amanda and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about the sign-in process for VA.gov.
Before we start, a few things I want to mention:
  - There are no right or wrong answers. We just want to hear your opinions, so that we can improve the application and meet Veterans' needs.
  - I won’t be offended by any opinions you express.
  - This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally interrupt you to move on to the next question.
  - Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
	  - If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
  - If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.

[Start recording]
  - I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
## Warm-up Questions- 5 minutes

  		- How is that experience different or similar to VA.gov?
## Sign-in process - 5 minutes:
  - Could you describe to me how you would sign in to the VA.gov site?
  - Would you be comfortable with screen-sharing your sign-in process with me and talking me through how you sign-in?
 
 **Things to watch for:**
  - Do they use search or browse?
  - If they search, what is that like? What about browsing?
  - How do they interact with the header if at all?
  - How do they interact with navigation if at all?
  - How do they switch between content pages using the navigation?
## Additional questions 10-15 minutes:
  - How often do you access VA.gov?
  - Which accounts (if you have multiple) do you use most often?
  	- Follow-on: Do you associate specific credentials with specific areas of VA? or Do use different credentials for different parts of VA? Why?
  - How would you describe your past and current experience with VA.gov?
  - Do you have others that sign in for you (Caregiver? Family member?) Tell me about some instances when you would have someone sign in for you.
  - Are there instances where you’ll use someone else’s login? Tell me about that process.
  - What are the most important tasks you or other people need to perform when using VA.gov?

   	- Follow-on: What issues have you experienced?

  - What steps do you take in trying to get those issues resolved?

## Mockup questions 10-15 minutes:
Thank you for sharing your thoughts with us so far. We put together a prototype we would love to get your feedback on [chat participant link to]
 
Reminder: Again, it’s really helpful as you talk aloud as you're looking through things. 
 
Scenario: Imagine you need to track the status of a claim [or task participant mentioned above]. You go to va.gov, then click the SIGN IN button.

- Take a min to look it over the screen
- What are your overall impressions?
	- Does this screen look familiar?
	- Does anything look different? 
- Which of these methods would you be interested in logging in with?
	- Rate each credential on a scale of 1 - 5, 1 being ”I would not use to sign in”, 5 being “I would definitely use to sign in”
- How would you proceed? [after giving impressions of changes]
	- If logging in with DSLogon or MHV [participant presented with second screen with new messaging and options]
		- Take a min to look it over the next screen
			- Which option would you prefer and why? (Login.gov, Id.Me, Skip)
			- What information would be most useful for you on these new options?
			- Was there any information that wasn’t useful for you on these new options?
			- Is there one that you trust more than the other? Why?
			- Have you ever used either of these credentials to sign in to services other than VA websites?
			- After reviewing this screen, rate the credential on a scale of 1 - 5, 1 being ”I would not use to sign in”, 5 being “I would definitely use to sign in”
	- If logging in with Id.Me, Why? 
- Was there anything missing that would have been helpful?
- Were there any areas you felt were unclear?
 
 **Things to watch for:**
- Is the modal information understandable?
- What questions do participants have if any?
- Is there enough information provided?
- Any hiccups? Anything unclear? 

## Final questions- 5 minutes:
  - If there were anything you could change about the process of getting a VA account or signing in, what would it be?
  - What is working about the sign-in process? 
  - Is there anything we haven’t talked about today that you think I should consider about the sign in process?
  - Do you have any questions for me?


## Thank You and Closing- 2-3 minutes:
Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.
Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
