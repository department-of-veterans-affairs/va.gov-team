## Overview
Weâ€™re building on **My VA 3.0** to introduce **alerts** â€” short, actionable prompts that help Veterans take timely action on things that matter most to them (like finishing a form, confirming an appointment, or refilling a prescription).

These alerts will appear directly on the **My VA page** within existing cards.  
The goal is to make it easy for Veterans to:
- See what needs attention  
- Act quickly  
- Feel confident theyâ€™re on top of their VA responsibilities

---

## Problem Statement
Right now, Veterans land on a **My VA** page thatâ€™s mostly static and doesnâ€™t do a great job surfacing whatâ€™s important or time-sensitive.  
Many miss key updates or deadlines simply because the information isnâ€™t visible or actionable when they log in.

**We need a better way to proactively surface timely, relevant actions.**

---

## Alerts
This section will include:
- A summary of alerts in production
- Their parent tool or data source  

Any content shown in current designs is **placeholder**.  
As of *October 17, 2025*, we are in the **discovery phase** and need to confirm data sources and information to promote through alerts.

---

## User Outcomes

### Desired
- Veterans see what requires their attention and why it matters.  
- They can take quick, direct action (e.g., check in, refill, submit, confirm).

### Undesired
- Page feels more cluttered or overwhelming.  
- Alerts feel redundant with other channels (email/text).  
- Veterans lose trust if alerts are inaccurate.

---

## Business Outcomes

### Desired
- Higher completion rates for key benefit workflows (forms, claims, refills, etc.).  
- Fewer missed appointments, fewer calls to support, fewer abandoned tasks.

### Undesired
- Support volume spikes and trust falls if alerts are not accurate.

---

## Analytics (Potential KPIs)
- % / # of Veterans who click on an alert  
- % of tasks completed after alert engagement *(requires downstream funnel)*  
- Error rate associated with alert-driven actions  
- CSAT / NPS changes for logged-in experience  

---

## OCTO OKRs

**Org Objective 1:**  
VAâ€™s digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.

**Contributing Key Results:**
1.1: Improve satisfaction with web and mobile products by **5 points**.  
1.3: **100% of transactions** are processed correctly or have an error message (alerts reinforce transparency and actionability).
