## Overview
Weâ€™re introducing a **Notifications Center** for Veterans â€” a global notifications icon appearing in the **authenticated header** across all VA.gov pages that directs the user to a page of all their current and past notifications.

---

## Problem Statement
Veterans often receive time-sensitive updates from multiple systems and channels, with no unified place to review or revisit them.  
This fragmentation causes **missed actions**, **duplicate outreach**, and **unnecessary calls to support**.

We need to give Veterans a **consistent, trustworthy notifications experience** on VA.gov â€” one that complements other channels and allows them to view both new and past messages in one place.

---

## Notifications
This section will include:
- A summary of notifications in production  
- Their source systems  

Any content shown in current designs is **placeholder**.  
As of *October 17, 2025*, we are in the **discovery phase** and need to confirm data sources and content.

---

## User Outcomes

### Desired
- Veterans can easily find all their VA-related updates in one place.  
- Notifications clearly communicate whatâ€™s new, what needs action, and whatâ€™s informational.  
- The experience feels familiar and intuitive â€” similar to what they expect from other modern apps.

### Undesired
- Veterans feel overwhelmed by too many or unclear notifications.  
- Notifications donâ€™t stay in sync with other VA channels.  
- Old or irrelevant notifications create noise or confusion.

---

## Business Outcomes

### Desired
- Fewer missed actions or duplicate communications across VA systems.  
- Improved satisfaction and trust in VA.gov as a reliable communication channel.  
- Reduced burden on contact centers due to better self-service visibility.

### Undesired
- Increased call center volume from confusing or inaccurate notifications.

---

## Analytics (Potential KPIs)
- % of notifications opened vs dismissed  
- % of Veterans who view or click a new notification  
- CSAT changes over time  
- Error or sync rate across channels

---

## OCTO OKRs

**Org Objective 1:**  
VAâ€™s digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.

**Contributing Key Results:**
1.1: Improve satisfaction with web and mobile products by **5 points**.  
1.3: **100% of transactions** are processed correctly or have an error message (notifications reinforce transparency).
