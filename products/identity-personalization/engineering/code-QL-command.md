# Running Code QL Locally (wip)

As answered by Nathan Randall of the embedded github team:

The codeql CLI is open-source software. Pretty much every CodeQL-related tool is actually using the codeql CLI somewhere, so you can use it to do pretty much anything that CodeQL actually does. Showing results is just a GitHub UI feature. All of the results are actually available in SARIF (JSON) formatted file that is generated by codeql database analyze command.

Minimal details here:

Please open a user request/issue if you would like some help in running codeql CLI locally.
