## Debugging - JS and ROR

How do we usually debug issues and bugs in our local environments?

- console and debugger (not as much as I should), react/redux devtools (Adam)
-
-

### JS
- Adam's search for a pesky element focus bug on the `/decision-reviews/board-appeal/request-board-appeal-form-10182` form app
  - This form isn't something we maintain, but it is using the contact information shared components to allow users to update their email, phone, or address directly within the form.
  - The mailing address validation flow was the source of the issue, specifically cancelling out of the address validation step. 
- [the mighty console](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console)
  - console.log()
  - console.table()
  - console.trace()
  - what other console or logging tricks do you find useful?
    - debug, group, dir, time
- [VScode debugger](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging)
  - [Our debug config for debugger using chrome](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/main/.vscode/launch.json)
  - setting breakpoints and stepping through functions
- react devtools [tutorial style app](https://react-devtools-tutorial.vercel.app)
