# Notes around engineering on the Authenticated Experience
 
### New Notification Center App!
- Any percieved challenges or ideas that have been percolating around building the MVP and beyond?
  - Pagination, dismissing alerts vs showing all with dismissed status, general design concerns?
  - Filtering and sorting concepets
  - Location of app folder - thoughts on why root vs inside personalization folder
    - AL - I was mostly following the [Creating a new application](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/creating-a-new-application#Creatinganewapplication-Manualsetup) doc (with help from Adrian Rollett) since it was the first time anyone on My VA has created a new app. Taking a look now, I do see the pros of possibly moving `notification-center` to `/personalization/`... ability to use common helpers, makes sense organizanatoinally. I don't think it would be too difficult 
  - API side? pagination support, filtering via query params, other metadata?
    - AL - This may be a conversation needed with Derrick or Tom, because I'm not quite sure how to get notifications to show up on staging. AJ usually pings the VANotify team and Chris Stoddard to get notifications to show up for certain staging users.
- App structure, organizational ideas or patterns that could be explored
  - redux/state store patterns [ducks](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux), [modular approach](https://www.genui.com/resources/modular-redux), [redux toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
  - component/folder structures
  - exploring custom hooks
  - making the mock server more easily set up or routes more easily configured to go along with cypress intercepts
  - a great time to look into other app patterns that might make this easier to build and maintain
  - using the  [CI/CD isolated build feature](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/isolated-application-builds) to do truly CI/CD or to at least reduce testing time for PR & Commits
   
### Yarn workspaces in vets-website
  - Adam had mentioned how imoprts can be either `~/` based as a workaround or the yarn workspace package name can be used, and is the official way that platform wants us to import packages from the `platform` folder
  - [PR that mentions the imports](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/pull/24664#discussion_r1253731771)
  - Eslint warnings will usually show some hints to help resolve the package import
    ```
    Importing from platform via platform/startup is deprecated.
    Import from @department-of-veterans-affairs/platform-startup
    instead or check babel.config.json for an alias to the import.
    ```
  - The main problem can be making sure that the way you are importing from the workspace package is correct.

  - Other interesting monorepo approaches with package namespaces [NX](https://nx.dev), [turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo), [pnpm workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces), [npm workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/using-npm/workspaces?v=true)
