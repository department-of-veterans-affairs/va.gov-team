# Engineering Meeting - Authenticated Experience

### Design System Component Library
 - web components built with [stencil](https://stenciljs.com/)
 - repo https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/component-library
 - Super easy to use and well documented
   - https://design.va.gov/components
 - React specific issues with web-components/stencil
    - Events can be tricky to hook up
    - Rendering children and interop with react can cause errors
    - navigation behavior challenges on thing like links - SPA vs MPA and react router
    - styling limitations and scoped styling is inflexible
 - Testing is hard for web components
    - unit testing the internals of the components when they are used is not really possible right now in vets-website
       - https://github.com/testing-library/dom-testing-library/issues/413 
    - e2e cypress testing requires [.shadow()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/shadow) to be used first
    - rendering lag / race conditions has been encountered when testing, and requires some jank fixes

### Unit testing concerns coverage and mocking dependencies

- Coverage should be around 75% on unit tests
   - Testing computations, conditional logic, and network request / response parsing is most critical
   - Try not to test content, css classes, or in-flux things unless logic revolves around it
   - Examples of mocking fetch or other component dependencies:
      - `mockFetch, setFetchJSONResponse, and setFetchJSONFailure` are [available in platform](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/main/src/platform/testing/unit/helpers.js#L110) to use to mock out network calls. One example of this being used is the [personalInformation.unit.spec.js test](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/main/src/applications/personalization/profile/tests/actions/personalInformation.unit.spec.js)
      - Using dependency injection is another way to test your component deps and functions. An example of using dependency injection with default arguments/props is the [PaymentHistory](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/main/src/applications/personalization/profile/components/direct-deposit/PaymentHistory.jsx) component where record event uses a default argument/prop, but then in the [unit test a spy can be substituted](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/main/src/applications/personalization/profile/tests/components/direct-deposit/PaymentHistory.unit.spec.jsx#L27)
- E2E tests should cover the main 'happy' path and edge cases/error paths should be tested whenever possible
- We should be using testing library in unit and end to end tests, and should not use enzyme to unit test React components
