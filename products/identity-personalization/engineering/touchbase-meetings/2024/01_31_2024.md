# Engineering meeting 01/31/2024

## Agenda

- The Great 2024 Mock Server-gate conundrum
  - [Ticket around this work and current status ](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/74968) 
  - CJS vs ESM, and how to mitigate
  - Concerns when forging a path forwar
    - Making changes to platform level code and what implications / cross app breaking changes could occur
    - Maintaining autocompletion and DX for engineering
    - Mocker-api is old, not great for building a mock api and could be replaced by better solutions
      - MSW, straight Express or Fastify implementations to allow ESM instead of CJS
      - Ideally, using a response in an e2e test should be easier / cross compatible with our local mock api setup
      - MSW has actually been [used in unit tests like in the appointments tests here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/main/src/applications/personalization/appointments/actions/index.unit.spec.js)   
- USWDS V3 migration
  -  Adam will be doing a push to migrate the rest (6 pages!) to USWDS by the end of next sprint when the deadline is.
  -  Alert has some bottom margin issues, and modals aren't great, but usable and issues have been submitted around large variant and button stacking
- State of OCTO presentation
  - Our work was featured in several areas including the dot indicator, authenticated menu dropdown, and direct deposit work!
  - 20 million unique sessions per month was mentioned, our work really does matter
  - Everyone is doing a great job making an impact. Thank you for all your hard work
  - If you have ideas to make engineering better at the VA or just within our team, no idea is too wild. You can even just dump ideas into [a shared doc that can be a living document](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/engineering/improvement-ideas.md)

## Cool dev stuff

https://fastify.dev
Fast and low overhead web framework, for Node.js
- like express but better. plugins over middleware, async/await out of the box, much better performance
- started/maintained by [Matteo Collina](https://github.com/mcollina), who is a member of node js working group and does lots of other cool open source work. Also runs https://platformatic.dev Saas offering.


Random unrelated IOT stuff:
 - https://mqtt.org a pub sub protocol for things like microcontrollers and IOT devices
 - https://micropython.org run python on a $3 computer
