# Engineering meeting 01/18/2024

## Agenda

- Personalization apps folder has been set to 'isolated'
  - Adam refactored all shared / cross imported code to move it to platform level or otherwise duplicated into respective folders where needed
  - Followed this [developer docs page instructions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/how-to-add-your-application-to-the-allow-list)
  - This should eliminate noise coming from failing unit tests for apps not related to personalization when merging into main on vets-website
  - Could also improve CI/CD pipeline, although Adam has seen variable improvements from 5 minutes to 15 minutes of reduced run time so jury is still out on that
- USWDS V3 migration
  -  Adam will be migrating personal information page this sprint
  -  Feb 16th all components will be default to v3 so hopefully there will be no breaking changes that we need to scramble to fix [see this slack message](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C03R5SBELQM/p1705503589174489)
