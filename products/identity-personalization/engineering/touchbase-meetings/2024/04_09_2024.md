# Engineering touchbase (async this week)

- Adam finishing up Direct Deposit work with help from Allison ðŸ¥³
- [MSW aka Mock Service Worker](https://mswjs.io/) is a way to mock api responses from requests locally and in tests. It has been mentioned that mocking the global fetch object can lead to memory leaks and errors in unit tests, and so it was suggested that MSW is used instead. It is an 'industry standard' for mocking network layer on the FE, and although we don't use it locally and still use the mocker-api package, it can be useful for the unit testing parts.
  - There is an example of using it in unit tests in the actions test for [directDeposit](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/main/src/applications/personalization/profile/tests/actions/directDeposit.unit.spec.js)
  - It would be cool to use MSW locally as well like we use the mocker-api, but Adam hasn't really looked into if that is possible / easy to set up. That way we could have our mock api and msw usage in tests set up the same way.

- Adam added a package to the repo dev dependencies: [@testing-libarary/react-hooks](https://github.com/testing-library/react-hooks-testing-library) provides utilities for unit testing your custom react hooks. Used for the `useDirectDeposit` [hook tests](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/main/src/applications/personalization/profile/tests/hooks/useDirectDeposit/useDirectDeposit.unit.spec.jsx).
