# Engineering meeting 01/04/2024

## Agenda

- Happy New Year!
- Revisitng Postman: How do you use Postman? What kind of authorization do you need? - AL
  - I am hoping to duplicate this API call: [Slack thread for context](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C05TU9FPZU0/p1702419429363369?thread_ts=1702417734.323489&cid=C05TU9FPZU0)
  - And I want to play around with the Appointments API endpoint too (e.g. https://staging-api.va.gov/vaos/v2/appointments?start=2024-01-04T20:09:33.162Z&end=2025-02-02T05:00:00.000Z&_include=facilities&statuses[]=booked) –– because I don't think this [fetchConfirmedFutureAppointmentsV2](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/311a335cddaa8000f2d3f67ef5a07e3db7ae6dcd/src/applications/personalization/appointments/actions/index.js#L97) function is truly returning future appointments
- Migration of Auth Exp to use USWDS3 design system components
  - Military information page
  - Gotchas:
    - Making sure you run yarn on local to have newest version of design sytem components lib
    - Components with breaking changes when it comes to using uswds prop
      - [Breadcrumbs](https://design.va.gov/storybook/?path=/docs/components-va-breadcrumbs--default) uses breadcrumb-list and wrapping when uswds prop is truthy
      - ??? haven't seen any of the other components yet with breaking changes, but we should definitely keep an eye out, maybe the modal or other more 'advanced' components
    - Some components don't have uswds props: va-link, va-card, va-loading-indicator so they don't need to be migrated... yet?
