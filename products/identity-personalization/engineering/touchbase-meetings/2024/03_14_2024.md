# Engineering meeting 03/14/2024

## Agenda

- Shout outs
  - ðŸŽ‰ Allison did a great job increasing FE unit test code coverage this last sprint! Two years ago there was pretty low coverage in the personalization folder, and today we are sitting around 80%.
  - ðŸ¥³ Daniel got his feature toggle work merged! That was a long journey and he came up with a pretty good solution that will allow a common source of truth to be used throughout mock servers, testing, and the implementation side of using the toggles on the FE.

- Direct Deposit work for migrating to a single form flow for cnp and education
  - Evaluating FE logic, creating diagrams, merging our diagraming efforts with BE docs to create 'one diagram to rule them all' ðŸ‘‘
