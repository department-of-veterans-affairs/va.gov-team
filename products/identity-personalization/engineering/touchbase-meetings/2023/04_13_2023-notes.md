# Weekly meeting notes around engineering on the Authenticated Experience team

- Moving meeting to Thursdays, so that we can concentrate on finishing tickets especially on the Tues before the sprint end.

  - We have our slack convo that is just the 4 of us where we can immediately ask engineering questions when they arrise.
