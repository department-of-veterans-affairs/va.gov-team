# SSO Team Charter

---

## Why we're here

### Desired Outcome:
Remove barriers to entry for users to access services between VA.gov, MHV, eBenefits, and My VA Health (Cerner) by ensuring session continuity and clear redirects from VA.gov to My VA Health.

### Workstreams: 
1. SSOe: Implement the VA's solution for session interoperability (see AccessVA for full list of current SSOe enabled sites)
2. Standalone Sign-in page: Create URL-based sign in page for users accessing the Cerner My VA Health tools
3. VA.gov Health pages (Prescriptions, Scheduling, Messaging, Lab & Test Results, Medical Records): Update alert boxes and main content to ensure users who are patients or caregivers of patients at a Cerner facility (such as Mann Grandstaff, Spokane) see the right information and are redirected to the correct page

#### Pipelines
- Icebox: used for tickets that are on a back burner for now
- Epics: used for Epics only
- Backlog: used for new tickets, that have not yet been groomed
- Ready: used for tickets that have been groomed (and have a complete description, acceptance criteria, Epics, and labels), but are not being activey worked on
- Current Sprint: used for tickets that are actively being worked on, that have story points (Estimate) and a person assigned to complete them (Assignee), the corre
- In Progress: not used
- Validate: used for tickets that have an open PR or are being tested
- Blocked: used for tickets that we are unable to work on at the moment due to external factors
- Closed: tickets which have been completed (or have been closed because they are no longer relevant, or duplicative)


#### Issue/Ticket/Story Etiquette
For an issue to go into the Current Sprint pipeline, it must have the following:

- Title that explains task
- Description with User Story or Background, and Acceptance Criteria
- Estimate
- Assignee
- Labels: `SSO-login`. For tickets that apply to a particular Health page on VA.gov, add: `Messaging`, `Prescriptions`, `Test-Results`, `Medical-Records`, or `scheduling` as needed
- Nested in an Epic

### Team Norms

- Be respectful, affirming, and optimistic, both online and off
- Show your face (Webcam) at meetings / calls
- Speak up! - everyone’s voice matters
- We are flexible, but intentional in the way we work
- Let’s have fun and do great work!

#### Slack:

This is our main means of communication with each other. Keep as much conversation in public channels as possible (as opposed to DMs), to minimize duplicative communication and maximize transparency and traceability.

#### GitHub
GitHub is the single source of truth. Every body of work should be documented for tracking and capacity planning. Our team folder:
/va.gov-team/products/identity-personalization/sso

#### General things
- Update tickets regularly. If conversations happen in Slack that are pertinent to a product or initiative, copy the useful info into GitHub/ZenHub.
- Extra time? Explore the "Backlog" and "Ready" columns in ZenHub and prepare any questions in advance for Grooming and Sprint Planning sessions.
