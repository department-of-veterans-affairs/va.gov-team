# Authenticated Experience Team Intake Process

`3rd DRAFT`

## Our Team 

Before you submit an intake ticket, we want to make sure you’re in the right place. 

### Who we are:
The Authenticated Experience Team has two main products: My VA and VA.gov Profile.
- Profile is the frontend used to allow users to update important information.
- My VA is a dashboard that seeks to surface relevant, actionable, time sensitive information to users about different VA benefits. 

We also have two smaller products, Nametag and the Authenticated Menu.

### Who we are not: 
- We’re not VA Profile, which is a backend system that manages profile information, but is a different team. 
- We’re not My HealtheVet as our products support many different benefits, not exclusively healthcare.
