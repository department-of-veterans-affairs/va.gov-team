# Authenticated Experience Team Intake Process

`Version 3.1` **Updated 5/14/2025**


## Our Team 

Before you submit an intake ticket, we want to make sure you’re in the right place. 

### Who we are:
The Authenticated Experience Team has two main products: My VA and VA.gov Profile.
- VA.gov Profile is the frontend used to allow users to view and update important information.
- My VA is a dashboard that seeks to surface relevant, actionable, time sensitive information to users about different VA benefits. 

We also have two smaller products, Nametag and the Authenticated Menu.

### Who we are not: 
- We’re not the VA Profile API team, which is a backend system that manages profile information, but is a different team. 
- We’re not My HealtheVet as our products support many different benefits, not exclusively health care.

## Our Intake Process

An intake form should be completed for **ALL** work being completed on My VA or VA.gov Profile so the Authenticated Experience team can ensure all projects are tracked and documented. This is regardless of what team is adding or updating the feature.

To get started:
1. Review the implementation documentation linked above that relates to the change you'd like to implement on My VA or VA.gov Profile.
   - If there is a change that you are attempting to complete but do not see documented let us know.
2. [Complete the intake ticket.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?template=auth-exp-request.yml)
3. Reach out to team on the #accountexp-authexp Slack channel for next steps. The team typically responds within 24 - 72 hours.

_Note: Ideally submitting an Intake Ticket should occur before Design Intent but should not occur after Midpoint Review. This allows the Authenticated Experience team time to provide support and knowledge to help reduce deployment timelines._
