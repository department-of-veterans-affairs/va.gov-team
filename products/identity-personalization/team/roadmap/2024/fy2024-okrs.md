# FY2024 Authenticated experience OKRs 

## [Link to slide deck on Sharepoint (must be on VA network to view)](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/sites/AccountExperienceCrew/Shared%20Documents/Authenticated%20experience%20team/FY2024%20OKRs_Auth%20Experience.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=Kh87b5)

## Charles’ OKRs: An overview

These are Charles’ three big objectives for 2024:
1. [Veteran-facing] Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.
2. [Platform] Our platforms are the best way to deliver products at VA.
3. [People]  Our people are empowered with the knowledge and resources they need to make sustained impact.

For the purpose of our team, the first objective – **Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits** – is the one that best applies to our work.

This objective has four KRs:

1. CSAT (customer satisfaction) for our web products have increased by 5 points.
2. Number of transactions processed using our products have increased by 25%.
3. All new products have a faster transaction time than those they replaced.
4. No transactions accepted by our products have a fatal error.

While we will likely keep an eye on all of these throughout the year, the second KR – **Number of transactions processed using our products have increased by 25%** – is where I think our work will have the biggest impact.

[For reference, here is the full list of Charles’ OKRs](#addendum-charles-octo-okrs).

## Auth experience OKRs

### Objective #1: Support Charles’ 2024 OKRs

#### KR: Support objective 1, key result 2 – Number of transactions processed using our products have increased by 25%.

The following initiatives will impact this KR:

- DS Logon/MHV retirement: Be part of a larger strategy to reduce DS Logon and MHV usage and increase ID.me and Login.gov usage by at least 25%, if not more.
- Add race and ethnicity to Personal Information (tentative): Adding this information to the profile will likely increase Personal Information transactions.
- Add pronouns and sexual orientation to Personal Information (tentative): Adding this information to the profile will likely increase Personal Information transactions.
= Note: There are mixed views on adding sexual orientation to the profile, which I’m happy to address.
- Military history expansion: We’ll have to discuss how we are measuring “transactions” here, but we should keep an eye out for increased pageviews and activity on this page as we expand what it shows.
- Add MHV notification preferences: Adding the MHV preferences will likely increase transactions on this page by at least 25%, if not more.

### Objective #2: Create greater cohesion among logged-in tools.

OCTO is divided into “crews”, and we are part of the Account Crew. This objective is one we also set at the crew level. The first KR is set at the crew level as well; the second and third KRs are  specific to our team.

#### KR: At least 50% of our initiatives should require us to work cross team/crew. 

The following initiatives will impact this KR:

- Notification preferences work
- Next of Kin/Emergency contact work
- Military info expansion
- Representatives/POA work
- Retirement of DS Logon and MHV (we should support this – how can we?? Notifications??)
- Personalization (ie. logged-in homepage) for the mobile app
- Dependents 

#### KR: Identify and implement/update at least 5 design patterns that can be used across the logged-in experience on VA.gov.

The following initiatives will impact this KR:

- Test and improve existing dot indicator.
- Design/implement other status indicators.
- Traditional “notifications” work (note: this would not be powered by VANotify).

#### KR: Identify and implement at least 5 navigation updates that expedite getting people to personalized tools.

The following initiatives will impact this KR:

- Federal header/footer testing and updates.
- Updates to the authenticated navigation.

## Notes on how we work

These are some things I wanted to call out as growth edges for how we are working now:

- **Work closely with the mobile team**: We should consider how our work affects the mobile app for all projects. There’s a divide between all web teams and the mobile team that we’re trying to reduce.
- **Always be thinking holistically**: For all projects initiated by us, we should be more proactive in thinking about how this work affects the broader user experience and what teams to loop into our work. An example of how we’ve done this well is the current military information expansion work.
