# Profile team priorities through Q4 2022 (October - December)

## Wins in Q3 2022 (July - September 2022)

We did a lot, including:

- Completed 99% of the bad address indicator work
- Re-integrated military information through VA Profile
- Launched a modal that asks if you want to update your mailing address when you update your home address
- Restricted character set for address fields to certain alphabetic and alphanumeric characters
- Updated A TON of documentation
- Completed an accessibility audit

...and much, much more that is still ongoing. Great work, team!

## Continuing and upcoming work for Q4 2022 

### Bad address indicator

This work is done! We're launching now (early October).

### Accessibility updates

- [Accessibility audit](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/accessibility/accessibility-audit-updates.md)
- [Accessibility epic](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/46756)

We will tackle accessibility issues that have been piling up over the last couple of years, and set up the profile for further growth in an accessible way. In addition to one-off tickets that are ready for us to implement, there are a number of larger/more complex problems that require research and discovery, including:

-  Whether we should move to a "one thing per page" model for editing
-  How to make address validation more accessible
-  What we should do about the nametag, and how these changes might affect My VA
-  Improving heading navigation in account settings
-  Improving how we handle in-line error messages
-  The "hubless spoke" problem

Because of the number of larger/more complex issues there are to investigate, this is a potentially substantial amount of work depending on what we decide to pursue, and may even take us into the new year.

**Anticipated launch**: Launches will be ongoing as items are updated

### Notifications preferences updates

As we anticipate eventually needing to add the 1095B preference and the MyHealtheVet preferences in 2023, we are going to need to make the following changes to notification preferences to better support those updates:

- Add the ability to detect default opt-in
- Move to a read-only/edit model for preferences (note: we can talk about whether this is single-page editing or not) 

**Anticipated launch**: TBD

### GA4 migration

According to the analytics team, we should anticipate some level of work around the Google Analytics migration to GA4. Details are TBD.

## Wait, that's it?

Given that a project like the 1095B work is on hold indefinitely, and that we know there are other substantial projects coming down the pipeline but don't know when (eg. MHV notification preference, or adding pronouns and sexual orientation to the profile), our team is in a position we haven't been in in a long time. We finally aren't cranking on a million things (thank you/sorry about that) and have some breathing room! And that feels great, but also a little bit scary.

**What else could we work on?**

Given that we don't currently have teams coming to us with immediate needs, we have the luxury of using this time to answer questions we've had for a long time. We're starting with the accessibility work, but depending on how much or little that yields (and I think that'll yield a lot), there are other questions that we should feel free to do some discovery on and see where that discovery leads us:

- Where does the profile meet user expectations? Where are we missing the mark?
- Should we had a section on dependents?
- Does our military information section meet user needs and expectations? Where do we miss the mark?
