# My VA team priorities through Q4 2022 (October - December)

## Wins in Q3 2022 (July - September 2022)

We did a lot, including:

- Launched the homepage > login > My VA redirect.
- Completed most of the work for the on-site notifications MVP.
- Completed an audit of current states of My VA.
- Completed a substantial amount of work on payments V2.

...and much, much more that is still ongoing. Great work, team!

## Continuing and upcoming work for Q4 2022 

### On-site notifications MVP

We're almost done! This should be launching early October.

### Payments and Debts V2

We'll move into QA, pre-launch tasks, and UAT for the payment and debts updates.

**Anticipated launch**: End of November/early December 2022.

### My VA Audit and updates

We'll continue the updates related to the My VA audit. Now that design is mostly done, we'll be moving into research and build. QA and pre-launch reviews will likely take place early in 2023. 

**Anticipated launch**: February 2023.

### On-site notifications: Continued development

After launching the on-site notification MVP, we'll monitor analytics for a bit, and then we'll start talking about our next steps. This is an important phase of the project where we'll figure out how to scale the feature, and we'll make determinations on when (if?) we might need to introduce a notification center.

**Anticipated launch**: 2023.

### Documentation

Now that we have some projects winding down, we'll want to start updating our documentation to reflect these new changes. We'll make sure that time is allotted for documentation at the end of each project.

### GA4 migration

According to the analytics team, we should anticipate some level of work around the Google Analytics migration to GA4. Details are TBD.
