# My VA team priorities through Q1 - Q2 2022 (January - June) 

### [Add payment information to My VA](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/payment-history/discovery-and-research/README.md)

People have mentioned that seeing payment info on their My VA dashboard is a high priority since our [initial dashboard discovery in 2020](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md#for-those-interested-in-education-benefits-gi-bill-balance-and-payment-information-was-most-important), and again in later research sessions, including during [December 2020 exploration research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/product/Research/MyVA-research-findings.md#additional-insights), [March 2021 usability testing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/product/Research%20V2/MyVA2-research-findings.md#features-users-expected-to-see-that-were-missing), and [July 2021 notifications discovery](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md#for-those-interested-in-education-benefits-gi-bill-balance-and-payment-information-was-most-important). The importance of payment information also bears out in analytics. Viewing payments is [a top interaction on VA.gov overall](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/report/content-event-events/a50123418w177519031p184624291/_u.date00=20201122&_u.date01=20211121&explorer-table.plotKeys=%5B%5D&explorer-table.rowCount=50&_r.drilldown=analytics.eventCategory:Interactions/), and "Payments" is  [a top search from the My VA dashboard](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/product/post-2.0-redesign-analytics.md#searches). This effort aims to add payment information to the My VA dashboard and to determine if any other financial information should be elevated as well.

**Targeted launch**: End of Q1/beginning of Q2 2022

### [On-site notifications MVP](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/notifications/vagov-notifications/mvp/README.md)

In addition to emails and text messages, on-site notifications are part of a cross-platform strategy to get important action items & alerts in front of VA.gov users. This effort aims to create the first on-site notification powered by the VANotify platform.

**Targeted launch**: Q2 2022

### Add medical copays to My VA

Now that medical co-pays have launched on VA.gov, we should add this information to the My VA dashboard after the initial "Benefit payments and debts" section launches. Adding this information will support My VA's primary mission -- to get action items in front user in a timely manner.

**Targeted launch**: Q2 2022

### [Evaluate redirect from logged-out homepage to My VA](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/product/my-va-redirect-transition-proposal.md)

It is an organizational priority to transition My VA to become the logged-in homepage over time. We plan to take an iterative approach to this by first redirecting users who sign in from the homepage to My VA. After the launch of the "Benefits payments and debt section", we're going to start doing this with a small subset of users, evaluate avalytics, and determine next steps for development,

**Run experiment**: Q2 2022 after "Benefit payments and debts" has launched

### Explore alternative layout for My VA

Right now, we organize My VA by Claims, Health care, Benefit payments and debts, and Apply for Benefits. I'd like us to explore whether a different structure -- one that organizes My VA by action items --> benefit status updates and in-progress applications --> task links -- is a better structure both from a UX perspective and a long-term growth perspective, OR whether the current organization more closely matches users mental models and needs.

**Start exploration**: Q2 2022
