# Profile team priorities through Q3 2022 (July - September)

## Wins in Q2 2022 (April - June 2022)

We did a lot, including:

- Launching the ability to view and update preferred name and gender identity in the profile.
- Removing logic that showed the direct deposit section conditionally.
- Thoroughly documenting the direct deposit section.
- Auditing the MHV profile, and presenting findings to stakeholders.
- Removing the requirement for the international postal code.

...and much, much more that is still ongoing. Great work, team!

## Work winding down in early Q3

- **Personal information revisions**: We need to finish some post-launch tickets, submitt for 508 review, and thoroughly document our work in Github.
- **Military information integration through VA Profile**: We need to conduct UAT, then we are ready for launch followed by documentation.
- **Confirmation to update mailing address after updating home address**: Launch postponed while we are dealing with some GA issues, but hopefully this will resume soon.

## Continuing and upcoming work for Q3 2022 

### Bad address indicator

We are currently conducting usability testing, followed by updates that have come out of testing, QA, and pre-launch tasks. Unless unforeseen issues come up, we'll likely have this out before the end of the quarter.

Additionally, we are working with VA Profile to get an email alert out for the bad address indicator. This work is going to go out separately from our UI updates, so we may see some improvements on this before the UI alerts have launched.

### Notification preferences

Work is ongoing. In the coming weeks, we anticipate updates to add an opt-in/opt-out to receive the 1095B tax form digitally. Additionally, Liz, Sharon, and Samara will be working with MHV stakeholders to define technical needs for migrating MHV notification preferences over to the VA.gov profile. 

### Profile documentation

This is some of the most important work we'll do this summer. My goal is that we have thorough documentation for the entire profile by the end of the quarter or sooner. Liz has already done a fantastic job of documenting the direct deposit functionality, and I'd like us to make decent headway on further documenting the profile before starting any signficant new design efforts.

In terms of who is responsible for this -- this is a full team effort, and is not just for the designers on the team. Everyone is responsible for creating this documentation and maintaining it going forward.

### Accessibility audit & updates

We should consolidate all accessibility feedback we've gotten, review it, and determine next steps. Tasks run from full-on projects (eg. moving edit from in-line to another page) to smaller tasks we can knock out as time allows. Either Liz or Christina is going to start on the audit once we've made decent progress on the profile documentation, likely some time in August.

### Forms system updates

A new version of the forms system is ready, so we need to update the profile so that it's using this new version. This might also help us with some accessibility issues in the long run.
