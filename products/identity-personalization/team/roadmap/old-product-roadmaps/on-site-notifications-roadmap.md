## Ideas from our team

|Project|Initiating team|Date of request| Status/Notes|
|----|----|----|----|
|Decision letter notification| - | - | Keep an eye on if this team works with VANotify to add notification functionality for this. We would definitely want to elevate as an onsite notification|
|Notification center| Auth exp.| N/A| This is something we'll need to revisit once VANotify supports more notifications that we want to show within VA.gov.|
