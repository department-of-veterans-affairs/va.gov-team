#### 11/06/2025 Alignment post midpoint review
- Met with Allison, Erin, and Jason on 11/6 to discuss email verification alerts
- Decided to move forward with informational modal when the user selects "Resend confirmation link" button. This is due to technology constraints so the on page alert can change real time to reflect if the email bounced or was non deliverable at the same time of the send.
- Slim vs standard alert. In profile we typically use standard alerts for page level communications and slim alerts for card level communications. So the slim alert will show only inline with the Contact email card, and the standard alerts will show at page level on My VA and Notification settings. Aligned during this call that using the slim alert inline with Contact email card is ok due to all context being within the alert itself.
