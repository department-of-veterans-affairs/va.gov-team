  - [Here is some test case documentation we already have put together](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/blob/master/Administrative/vagov-users/staging-test-accounts-direct-deposit.md).

Sprint 8 Epic [#54916](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vft-59c95ae5fda7577a9b3184f8/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/54916)

### Accessibility

**FE - Adam**
- Code cleanup; Any bug fixes; Remove feature toggle(s)
- Assuming all work is done, we can close out this project! If not, extend into sprint 9.

### Direct deposit: EVSS > Lighthouse migration

**Is backend/frontend work done at this point? If so, we are ready to move on to QA.**

Things that need to be true for us to move on to QA:

- All BE work is done.
- All FE work is done.
- Tom has validated that Lighthouse is connecting downstream to staging user data accordingly, so we're able to validate things on staging through QA.

If anything is not done, move QA back a sprint.

**Whole Team**

- Run QA & create bug tickets
  - Everyone should be part of this.

**BE -- Tom**

- If time, start on fixes from QA

### Notification preferences

**FE - Adam**

- Build editing page for profile PT2 #54434
- Build the new page for the mobile # #53547

### Logged-in IA/nav research

**Design - Liz**

- User research write-up
- Start consolidated report on all research efforts
  - This should highlight the main problems with navigating the logged-in experience, as supported by our research review, analytics, and user research. 
  - It does not need to be overly redundant of the user research report.
  - It does NOT need to pose immediate solutions, though it can provide high-level recommendations on next steps (eg. more research in specific areas; elevating XYZ; etc).
 
## Sprint 9 (4/26 - 5/9)
Sprint 9 Epic [#56506](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/56506)


### Direct deposit: EVSS > Lighthouse migration
**BX Note: Let's move the following to Sprint 11**
~This assumes QA is done, and any fixes from QA have been implemented. If not, please adjust the plan accordingly.~

**PM**
~- Fill out [release plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/product-management/release-plan-template.md) and add it to [project folder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/direct-deposit/evss-lighthouse-migration)~
~- Submit ticket for privacy and security review~

~- Run sessions~

**BE**

~- Assist with privacy and security review submission~

**BX: Move QA tasks to Sprint 10**

**BE**

**This assumes Tom is mostly off of direct deposit work. If that is backed up and still going, please prioritize it accordingly**

- Default send technical discovery **(BX: See paragraph below for Tom's answers)**
  - What is required to consume default opt-in indicator?
  - While the UI may not change, does this require any FE changes in terms of how FE connects to BE, or is this entirely BE work? 
  - Confirm whether default send work needs to happen before Adam can start on FE updates based on Liz's designs.

_There doesn't seem to be any BE work required - the default opt-in indicator is already present in the responses from vets-api.   Here are the [discovery notes](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/notification-preferences/discovery-and-research/default-send/july-2022-notes.md).
