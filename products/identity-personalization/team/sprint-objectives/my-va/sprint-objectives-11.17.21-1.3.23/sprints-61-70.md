## Sprint 63 (12/15 - 12/28)
[Sprint 63 Epic](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/30189)

### PTO

### General My VA improvement

**FE**

- Update how we handle the education block in the "Benefits you might be interested in" section [#33976](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/33976)

**Design**

- Rethink the "Benefits you might be interested in" section
  - The endpoint we are using to determine whether we show education benefits or not has been acting unreliably and affecting loading of this whole section.
  - I also think some people who could apply for health care aren't seeing the prompt.
  - How can we update this section? Show all three blocks? Remove this section altogether and add prompts to healthcare/disability/education elsewhere?

### My VA updates: Adding payment information

Research planning/midpoint review planning

**PM**

- Schedule midpoint review for next sprint
- Put together list of test cases

**Design**

- Finish design if not already done
- Research planning/convo guide
- Recruit if possible (nice to have, not a requirement)
- Work with PM on list of test cases

**FE**

- Technical discovery. Based on this, Taylor should be able to define how the following will work:
  - Whether Tressa's proposal for when this section will show (or not) works
  - How he will retrieve the payment information we tend to show
  - How he will show the debt information we need to show
  - Any other technical details that we should define before moving into implementation 

### On-site alerts MVP

Resume project!!

**PM**

-  Work with team to define needs for VANotify, determine what they need to do, and determine timeline for any work they need to do.

**Design**

- Now that this project is back on, do we want to update how where/how we plan to show alerts on My VA?
  - If not, that's fine. If so, we'll need to update designs accordingly. 

**BE**

- Determine next steps for backend build; If possible, Lihan can start to implement build if possible

## Sprint 64 (12/29 - 1/11)
[Sprint 64 Epic](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/30269)

### Payment information

Midpoint review; Research planning

**PM**

- Hold midpoint review

**Design**

- Research convo guide
- Research recruiting
- If FE can not build a prototype by the end of this sprint, then we need a UXPin prototype so that research sessions can happen in sprint 65

**FE**

- Prototype build on payment info
  - **Note**: Research needs to happen *in sprint 65*. If this prototype can not be done by then, then we need to do something in UXPin or figure out another strategy. 

### On-site notifications

**PM** 

- Regroup with VANotify to determine what their LOE and timeline is for this work
  - This can likely happen in the same convo where BE discusses/determines how they'd like to receive data from VANotify

  - https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/34708

**BE**

**Is VANotify going away again? If so, we might remain on hold with the backend build :(.**

- Start build
  - Also, I would love an estimate on how long build will take. Is it one sprint? Two? More? This likely depends on VANotify's timelines.
- Determine necessary error states

## Sprint 67 (2/9 - 2/22)
[Sprint 67 Epic](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/30272)

A note on stuff from last sprint:

- Always move over any unfinished project work to keep us on time with projects.
- If there were general tickets we added to last sprint because we thought we had time but then ended up not having time, only move those over *if* (1) they are high priority, or (2) we clearly will have time this sprint. Otherwise, it's OK to deprioritize. Always feel free to ask if you have questions.

### Payment history

**Main goal for this sprint**: Be ready for QA. Prioritize tickets & work accordingly so that anything that is a QA dependency gets top priority.

**PM**

- Review QA test cases and make sure they are accurate given any updates from user testing
- Informal click through of the feature to make sure it is ready for QA
- Meet to discuss approach for adding medical copay information
  -  Are we adding this to Benefit payments & debts, or health care?
  -  Does this need separate user research?
  -  Is this more of an enhancement or small, separate project? 
  -  [Link to medical copay content page](https://staging.va.gov/health-care/pay-copay-bill/your-current-balances/)

**Design**

*Liz*

- Update My VA contact center guide with Benefit payments & debts info
  - May also need to update content on "Benefits you might be interested in" since that has also changed

### PTO

- Angela: 2/24 - 2/28

### Payment information

Sprint goal: Complete QA

**PM**

- Make sure QA is ready to go. All features/updates should be finished, and each team member should have reviewed the feature on staging to make sure it's good to go. (#35254)
- Submit Analytics request. (#37376)
  - We need tracking for all the new links -- View payment history, direct deposit, clicks into the debt tool, and clicks for the new travel reimbursement link we added to health care. Otherwise, we should be good to go, as we already track searches initiated from this page on [the My VA 2.0 GA dashboard](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/dashboard/XOEdSZeVT9qyxQU5T29PNw/a50123418w177519031p176188361/).

**Design**

- If not already done, complete UAT planning (#36678, #36690)
- Depending on when QA is done and if any issues are found, we can start on fixes

**FE**

- Depending on when QA is done and if any issues are found, we can start on fixes

**QA**

- Complete QA (#35149)

### Medical copays

**PM**

- Fill out collab kickoff ticket (#37373)
  - You might want to clarify that this is a pretty small effort, but we'll likely want support for design and research, since this has a research component. Otherwise, we're happy to do whatever reviews they recommend, but they should all be brief and super easy. 

**Design**

- Discovery (#36899)
- Design exploration (#36902)
- Design intent, if we're ready for it. This can be moved to the following sprint if need be. (#37387)

## Sprint 69 (3/9 - 3/22)
[Sprint 69 Epic](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/30274)

### PTO

We are officially in pre-launch! So, we need to make sure anything outstanding from last sprint is completed, plus:

**PM**

- Make sure analytics updates get implemented (#37876)
- Put together launch plan; Prep for staging review (#37877, #37878, #37879)

### Medical co-pays

**Design**

- Finish design explorations
- Hold design intent if we did not already hold it (#37910-closed)
- Research planning -- What do we need to do, if anything, in addition to getting feedback during payment UAT?

## Sprint 70 (3/23 - 4/5)
[Sprint 70 Epic](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/30275)

### Payment info

This may need to adjust based on what we were able to get done in sprint 69 due to the QA delays, so if there were important things we didn't get done in sprint 69, we should move them over and adjust this list as necessary:

- Submit privacy and security review (this is async) #37881
- UAT go/no-go (this can not be held until we have cleared all launch blocking issues from the staging review) #38148
- Stretch goal: Start recruiting for UAT if we are able to hold UAT go/no-go #38194

### On-site notifications

  - This would replace our current notification style alert 

### My VA Audit - #38967

Goal of this work: To understand all the conditionals we have for each section in hopes of simplifying logic across (and therefore, management of) My VA. This does not yet have to be on GitHub -- if a Mural board or something more visual like that is an easier way to analyze and see states, let's start there.

- Audit all states of the nametag #38969
- Audit all states of Claims & appeals section #38970

### General

- Implement consistent pattern for aligning links when gray boxes are absent #38658 
- Payment info post-launch: Add loading animation for the payment section (this will match how we handle loading for claims and health care info) #38803
- Adding new Cerner facility to My VA Cerner alert #38508
