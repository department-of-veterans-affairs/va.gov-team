# Authenticated experience team charter

**Last updated January 26, 2022**

## What we strive for

### Vision

The authenticated experience team wants to work towards a concierge-like VA experience, one that puts veterans' and other customers at the center of the interaction. We see a world in which:

- The service member to veteran transition is seamless.
- We never ask a veteran to provide a DD214 (proof of service).
- Veterans can easily understand what benefits they’re eligible for.
- Veterans can apply for/enroll in benefits with one click.
- Veterans and their communities can mostly interact with the VA through text messages and email.
- A veteran's logged in portal competes with the best private sector experiences.

### Mission 

To move us towards this vision, our current mission is to create a logged in experience on VA.gov that:

- Elevates veteran action items and time-sensitive tasks.
- Serves up status updates in a clear and scannable (what does "scannable" mean? and how do we measure it?) manner.
- Differentiates itself from the logged out experience.
- Elevates veteran data so that it tells a story.
- Consolidates health & benefit data so that it doesn't feel silo'd.

### North star objectives

- Reduce the amount of time it takes to interact with the VA.
- Make interacting with the VA feel as easy as sending an email.
- Make the VA feel like it's a 1:1 experience.

## Workflow + Cadence

### Stand-up: people & product check-ins
(This subsection updated 4.14.2023)
* **My VA Team**: 
Mon 11:30am-12pm ET
Tues (Slack-Up)
Wed (replaced by Sprint Retro/Planning during Week 1, and Backlog Refinement/Grooming during Week 2 of Sprint)
Thu 12:30-12:45pm ET
Fri (Slack-Up)

* **Profile Team**: 
Mon 12:15pm-12:30pm ET
Tues (Slack-Up)
Wed (replaced by Sprint Retro/Planning during Week 1, and Backlog Refinement/Grooming during Week 2 of Sprint)
Thu 11:30am-11:45am ET
Fri (Slack-Up)

  
1. Team update
  - what was worked on yesterday towards sprint goal
  - what is being worked on today towards sprint goal
  - what blocks could prevent us from meeting sprint goal

2. General discussion (aka Meet After, 16th Minute)
  - if blockers can't be addressed during this huddle, ensure team members get support beyond stand up


### Sprint Planning
(This subsection updated 4.14.2023)
Outline team and member focus, goals for sprint:  
- 1st Wednesday of every sprint  
- 1 hour 

### Retro
(This subsection updated 4.14.2023)
Review accomplishments from prior sprint, what went well, areas for improvement, what to start doing:   
- 1st Wednesday of every sprint, right before planning   
- 30 min

### Grooming
(This subsection updated 4.14.2023)
Assess and update workload for remainder of sprint and loosely discuss next/future sprint(s):  
- 2nd Wednesday of every sprint for one-hour

#### What

In grooming, we will walk through each team member's Zenhub board to make sure tickets are ready by the time we get to sprint planning. By the end of grooming:

- 100% of tickets have are associated with an epic.
- 100% of tickets have acceptance criteria.
- 100% of tickets are estimated.
- 100% of tickets are appropriately labeled.
- At least 3 sprints out, 5 tickets tentatively assigned to those iterations.

#### Prior to grooming

Please review `needs-grooming` tickets within your discipline (determined by the right GitHub label e.g. `frontend`).

### Issue Etiquette

#### Issue creation

You can create issues for yourself or the team throughout the sprint. We'll use grooming to get tickets ready to go before they are put in the "Current Sprint" column on our Zenhub board.

For an issue to go into the Current Sprint column, it must have the following (created using the “Standard Issue Template”):
- Estimate
- Title that explains task
- Description with Background and Acceptance Criteria
- Labels - vsa-authenticated-exp (and cross functional team labels)
- User Story, Goal, Acceptance Criteria - please fill out the Goal and any known acceptance criteria. The PM will revise as necessary.
- Epic assigned
- Milestone
  
#### Estimation
Estimation is based on a combination of a few factors — how long something will take to complete, risk, level of effort (LOE), and complexity. We have found [this scale](https://www.scalablepath.com/blog/agile-points-explained-fibonacci-sequence/) to be helpful in estimating tickets.

 - 1 - Easy task, work is known, can be executed quickly   
 - 2 - Mostly known, doable
 - 3 - Becoming complex, maybe be 2 - 3 days of work 
 - 5 - More complex, may take a full week   
 - 8 - Needs to be broken down into smaller user stories      

#### Issue validation 

All work should be validated either in staging or production, as defined by the acceptance criteria. Each ticket's last comment before closing should reflect whether validation has occurred, and by whom. By default, assign your PM to validate any tasks you are unable to validate yourself.

If there is a new RED LIGHT URGENT work request, contact the Product Manager and ask for help to work it into the sprint.
 
### Team Norms

- Be respectful, both online and off
- Show your face (Webcam) at meetings / calls
- Speak up! - everyone’s voice matters
- We are flexible, but intentional in the way we work
- Let’s have fun and do great work!

**And some logistics:**

- Keep as much Slack conversation in public channels as possible, to minimize duplicative and extraneous communication.
GitHub is the single source of truth. Every body of work should be documented for tracking and capacity planning.
- Update tickets regularly. If conversations happen in Slack that are pertinent to an issue or useful to document, copy them into GitHub.
- Our tickets/issues have an estimated level of effort, clear acceptance criteria, and an individual or team assignee before being put in a sprint.
- Extra time? Explore the "Ready" column in ZenHub.
