# Transition Notes for My VA UX Designer
Last updated: November 8, 2023

Welcome to the Authenticated Experience team! You're in good hands. Here's some things you might want to know outside of your onboarding ticket that are specific to your role on the team. Feel free to reach out to me any time on Slack @angela agosto.

## [My VA Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/15yOY4VEzitxm5tRMDiAzz/My-VA?type=design&node-id=9%3A15723&mode=design&t=wEZ3egLDtW4VPDJo-1) (replacing the original Sketch file)
* This is the main (and only) ~~Sketch~~ Figma file for the My VA page. Unlike Profile which has several Figma documents, all current and past My VA designs live in this one doc.
* Pages contain:
  * Current **desktop** and **mobile** designs, mocked up to show various scenarios
  * **Symbols** contains a symbol for each scenario for each section on desktop and mobile, as well as a few other symbols specific to My VA. If there were any changes to the design, I first updated them here and then adjusted the spacing in the Desktop and Mobile pages (because Sketch doesn't have auto-layout). There may be a better way to do this once we all switch to Figma but it's been the quickest way to update a section on multiple artboards at once.
  * **Exploration** page is what I used for design mockups that weren't final, i.e. when I needed to show a bunch of options to stakeholders
  * **User flows** for each section are there as individual pages. I updated those when there was a change to the flow; not necessarily to reflect smaller design changes (which is noted at the top of each flow). These are linked in the [use case documentation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/use-cases) within each section.
  * **Archive** page is where I pasted in old deprecated designs and I also tried to hold on to concepts that weren't chosen, just in case you ever end up in one those situations where the client or team is like "Remember that one idea we had..."


## [Authenticated Experience Pattern Library Sketch file](https://www.sketch.com/s/225eebbb-fb9a-42db-8655-75c30a9dc935/symbols)
* This is where the Profile and My VA team put components that are specific to one or both of our pages that either are not in the VA Pattern Library or components have had to be broken and modified to fit our purposes
  * Note: This should be less common once VA switches to Figma. Sketch doesn't allow for much flexibility with components so we've had to do this often.
