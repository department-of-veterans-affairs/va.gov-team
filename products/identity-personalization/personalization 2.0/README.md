## The Problem

The [Personalization 2.0 Discovery: Summary and Strategy](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Identity/Personalization/Personalization%202.0/Discovery%20%26%20Research/Personalization%202.0%20Discovery%20Summary%20%26%20Strategy.md) fully outlines the problems that motivate this project.

### Discovery

For further elaboration on the problems we aim to solve, please see our [Personalization 2.0 discovery work](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/tree/master/Products/Identity/Personalization/Personalization%202.0). **Note**: This work was originally tracked in the vets.gov-team repo. As of 9/24/19, we are tracking the all future work for Personalization 2.0 in the va.gov-team repo.

### User Goals

As a user, I want to:

- Be able to quickly complete tasks on VA.gov.
- Clearly see all the information VA knows about me.
- Be notified of relevant updates and any actions needed from me.

### Business Goals

As the authenticated experience team, we want to be able to do the following:

- Elevate personally relevant information to users where and how they expect that information to be elevated.
- Provide clear wayfinding to tasks people need to complete related to their personal experience (eg. refill a prescription, change their address, etc).
- Update people when the status of their information changes.
- Have personalized pages that are scalable and allow for feature growth.
- Reduce redudancy between the existing My VA and VA.gov homepage.

## Assumptions

1. People want us to combine Profile and Account. (We found evidence for this [in discovery](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Identity/Personalization/Personalization%202.0/Discovery%20%26%20Research/Personalization%202.0%20Discovery%20Summary%20%26%20Strategy.md#observations-profileaccount)).
2. We should get rid of My VA in favor of a logged in homepage, OR make the new combined Profile/Account the new My VA.

## Questions

1. Should we get rid of My VA in favor of a logged in homepage?
2. Should the new My VA actually be the new combined Profile/Account?
