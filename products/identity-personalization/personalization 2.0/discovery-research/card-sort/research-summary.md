# Research Summary for Personalization 2.0 Card Sort

Samara Strauss | Summer 2019

# Background

[Card sort research plan]()

This card sort was conducted as part of the Personalization 2.0 project. We felt a card sort would supplement [other research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/personalization%202.0/discovery-research) by helping us to answer the following:

- How would veterans group different personalized features?
- What kind of language are veterans expecting to see when it comes to categorizing groups of different features (eg. profile, dashboard, settings, my stuff, etc)?
- How should we organize features that don't currently exist on VA.gov but we expect to exist in the future (eg. notifications or direct deposit info)? 
- Should we organize applications in their own category, or in benefit specific categories?
- Should we combine the existing profile and account settings pages? Do users see any difference between these two pages?
- Should the existing My VA dashboard, user profile, and account settings page all be reorganized into one singular experience instead of three disparate pages?

# Methods

## Conducting the card sort

- We conducted an open card sort via [Optimal Workshop](https://www.optimalworkshop.com). An open card sort asks participants to sort a list of items into groups and then name those groups. This differs from a closed card sort, in which participants have to sort items into a set of provided groups.
- This card sort included 45 cards that listed different features and tools that currently appear on My VA/Profile/Dashboard, as well as features that may appear on the website in the future.
- This card sort was circulated via the MyHealtheVet newsletter on **July 29, 2018**. It was closed **August 2, 2019**. 

## Participants

**67 people** participated in the card sort. Of those 67, 65 reported that they were veterans and two reported they were the spouse of a veteran or active service member.

# Results 

[Optimal Workshop Raw Results](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/a/adhoc/optimalsort/results/fe22880e-3a51-48e9-a115-e052ad5293b5#/t/overview) (For login credentials, Search "Optimal Workshop" in Slack)

## How we evaluated the card sort

As we were initially combing through the results, it became clear that people weren't sorting items based on the groups that they *could* go in, but instead on the groups that applied most directly to *their* personal use cases. For example, we saw categories like "Miscellaneous," "Not used," and "Not applicable" that were highly variable.

Given the high level of personalization we saw in the results, we did not look for perfect uniformity in any category, but common categories and common trends within those categories. Specifically we looked at:

- **Frequently used category names** — We used the Optimal Workshop standardization feature to group lists of items that had the same or similar names (eg. Medical, Medical Info, and Medical Information). 
- **Lists with different names but similar items** — After we grouped categories with similar/the same names, we looked for categories that had different names but similar items in their lists (eg. Medical and Health Care) and grouped them together.
- **Common cards within groups** — Once we had grouped all of the related lists we found, we looked for the most common cards within those categories. For the most part, we ignored outlier cards.

| Additional responses | 8 or fewer responses each |

### Takeaways

**We should combine Profile and Account into one section.**

One of the biggest questions we had going into this research was whether we should merge the existing Profile and Account pages into one section. In this card sort, people grouped items into the personal info/profile category that we currently have split across the two pages (eg. grouping "Verify your identity on VA.gov" and "Change your password" which are currently in Account Settings with "Your name", "Your phone number," etc., which are currently in the Profile). This supports our instinct to combine Profile/Account into one section segemented with additional navigation instead of keeping these as two separate pages.

**We need more research before combining My VA with Profile/Account into one mega section.**

Another big question we had was whether we should combine My VA/Profile/Account into one mega-section. There were quite a few other account management capabilities grouped into this category (eg. "Your documents", "Download your VA letters and documents", etc.), but nothing in significant numbers (10+ respondents). This could potentially mean we should more closely associate My VA with Profile/Account, but we definitely need more research to verify this assumption since numbers are low.

**Notifications and Direct Deposit should go with other personal information.**

We also wondered where participants would place features not yet on VA.gov, and we see that they expect to see Notifications and Direct Deposit with their Personal/Profile information. 

## Medical/Health Care (29/67 participants)

### What participants called this category

- Medical (11)
- Medical Info/Information (3)
- VA Medical (3)
- Health/Health care (3)
- VA Medical Center (2)
- Medical Records (1)
- VA Medical Benefits (1)
- My VA Health care (1)
- VA Medical Application/Medical Services (1)
- Medications and appointments (1)
- My Health Care Benefits (1)

### Frequently sorted cards

| Card | Frequency |
|---|---|
| Schedule an appointment at the VA | 26 |
| Your secure messages with your doctor | 24 |
| A list of your prescriptions and refill statuses | 24 |
| Download your VA medical records | 23 |

| Updates on the status of your health care application | 13 |
| Your application for VA health care | 10 |
| Your Vocational Rehab application | 7 |
| Additional cards | 3 or fewer responses each |

### Takeaways

**People organized health care-related items as we expected.**

This category is largely what we would have expected — most of the health care management tasks grouped together on MHV and VA.gov are grouped together here.

Less than half of the participants who filled this out think of the application as part of the Medical/Health care process. That is perhaps because everything else in this category besides the application has to do with the post-enrollment state.

**Medical supplies and community care-related info should be grouped with health care information.**

This information does not currently exist on VA.gov and it is helpful for us to see that people expect it to be grouped with other health care-related tasks.

## Disability (25/67 participants)

### What participants called this category

- Disability(ies) (7)
- Disability Info/Information (3)
- Claims (2)
- Disability Claim Process (1)
- Compensation (1)
- Claim approve (1)
- Disabiities related info (1)
- Disabiity status (1)
- Disability Claims (1)
- VA Disabiity & Payments
- Disability & Pension Info
- Disability benefits (1)
- Disability Claim Application (1)
- VA Disability Claim and Compensation (1)
- Claims and payments (1)

### Frequently sorted cards

| Card | Frequency |
|---|---|
| Track your VA disabiity claim or appeal status | 24 |
| Your disability claim(s) | 22 |
| An alert that your disability claim has been approved | 20 |
| Your individually rated disabilities | 20 |
| Disability compensation payments made to you by the VA | 19 |
| Your combined disability rating | 19 |
| Upload claim or appeal supporting documents that were requested by the VA | 13|
| Additional cards | 8 or fewer responses each |

### Takeaways

**Disability > Claims**

For the category name, we saw "Disability" much more frequently than "Claim(s)." This may be because the word "disability" appeared more throughout the list of individual items than the word "claims." Going forward, we should confirm that "disability" is the best title for this category through future testing.

**Put disability claims with the other disability-related tasks.**

Unlike with health care, we can see that the majority of users who created a "Disability" category expect to see information related to the application process grouped in this category instead of elsewhere. This is perhaps because most disability tasks have to do with the application process, whereas most health care tasks have to do with post-enrollment management.

**Group eligibility information by benefit? Maybe.**

The "Your benefit eligibility" card was grouped in this category 8 times, loosely suggesting that people want eligibility/get started information associated with this category (and potentially other categories). Anecdotally speaking, many veterans we talk to know the disability rating process is especially cumbersome, so this may be why they are looking for extra help to get the process going.

## Benefits (13/67 participants)

### What participants called this category

- Benefits (8)
- Benefits & Claims (1)
- Benefit Documents (1)
- My VA Benefits (1)
- Available Benefits (1)
- Benefits/Disability (1)

### Frequently sorted cards

| Card | Frequency |
|---|---|
| An alert that your application for GI Bill benefits has been approved | 11 |
| Your GI Bill benefits balance | 11 |
| GI Bill payments made to you by the VA | 10 |
| Your GI Bill benefits application | 9 |
| How to get started with VA benefits | 8 |
| Your application for a VA Home Loan Certificate of Eligibility | 7 |
| Disability compensation payments made to you by the VA | 6 |
| Pension payments made to you by the VA | 6 |
| Your application for a VA pension | 6 |
| Your benefit eligibility | 6 |
| Your Specially Adapted Housing Grant application | 5 |
| Additional cards | 4 or fewer responses each |

### Takeaways

**People care about what's relevant to *them*, not how all veterans would group information.**

This is an interesting category, since I think we'd assume that people would have divided GI Bill/Disability/Pension info into separate categories. However, I don't think this catch-all category suggests that they wouldn't do that. I think this category resulted from a bunch of people grouping the individual benefit information they felt was relevant *to them* — just like the personalized dashboard does now. I don't think this necessarily suggests that we should group all benefit information together without division, but that people expect to see all of *their* benefit information in one place, regardless of what the specific combination of benefits might be.

## Applications (13/67 participants)

### What participants called this category

- Applications (9)
- Benefit Applications (1)
- Application for VA Benefits (1)
- Benefits and Applications (1)

### Frequently sorted cards

| Card | Frequency |
|---|---|
| Your Specially Adapted Housing Grant application | 12 |
| Your application for a VA Home Loan Certificate of Eligibility | 12 |
| Your application for VA health care | 11 |
| Your pre-need application for burial in a VA National Cemetery | 10 |

| Upload claim or appeal supporting documents that were requested by the VA | 6 |
| Your GI Bill benefits application | 6 |
| An alert that your application for GI Bill benefits has been approved | 5 |
| How to get started with VA benefits | 5 |
| Additional cards | 3 or fewer responses each |

### Takeaways

**Applications can either be organized by benefit or with all applications.**

One of the big questions we were trying to answer with this card sort is whether we should show in-progress applications and application updates on VA.gov in an "Applications" category or whether we should show applications in their respective benefit categories (eg. "Disability," "Health care," etc.). I don't know that we got a definitive answer to that either way in this study for two reason:

  - First, it's unclear whether people grouped these applications together because they were cueing off the word "application" and grouping like terms with like terms, or because people wanted to see all of their applications together. 
  - Second, we did see some people grouping the health care and disability applications in their respective benefit categories, as noted above.

Overall, I think this actually indicates that we could take either approach — either group all applications together or group applications with benefit categories, just as long as we are consistent in our approach. We can validate this with further testing once we're ready to test a proposed IA or mockups.

## Other categories we saw

We saw these categories in low numbers. Given the difficulty of the card sort, I wouldn't dismiss these as bad or insignificant terms. Instead, I'd consider them important simply because they repeated at all in a card sort that otherwise showed significant variation in the results. We should keep these terms in mind and consider if and how we might use them going forward. That being said, more testing would have to be done to verify that these terms, or any terminology we incorporate going forward, most accurately represent veterans' mental models:

- Documents (8)
- Housing/Home (7)
- Records (6)
- Payments (6) 
- Pension (5)
- Getting Started (5)
- Security (4)
- Housing (4)
- GI Bill (4)
- Burial (4)
- Your VA (3)

## Categories we didn't see

**Account**

I was really surprised we only saw one person use the term "Account" in their categories. While we need to verify all nomenclature through future testing, we may want to consider removing "Account" from VA.gov in favor of "Profile" or "Settings" depending on the use case.

## Additional observations

### The card sort was hard, and this affected the results

We had 322 total people view the card sort, and 255 abandoned the sort. Of the 67 people who took the card sort, 26 rated the sort as "Very Difficult" (8 people) or "Difficult" (18 people), though it's worth noting the other 41 participants rated the card sort as "Neither Easy or Difficult" (30 people), "Easy" (8 people) or "Very Easy" (3 people).

But it wasn't just the high abandon rate or the amount of people who rated the sort as difficult that clued us into participants having found the sort to be challenging. With 45 cards, the average number of categories created was only 4, even though we expected this information to be sorted much more granularly. Likely, there was some level of cognitive fatigue that set in with so many cards, resulting in nonsense category names, like numbers, question marks, and at least two people who "completed" the sort by putting all 45 cards into one list.

That being said, this card sort was largely exploratory and we did not intend it to produce be-all-end-all IA for the website. We were able to draw some helpful insights, and we likely wouldn't have done things too differently were we to go back and do it again. However, if we wanted to get more exact results that could potentially provide IA for the website, we would probably want to do a card sort with fewer cards and fewer words on each card, or a closed card sort.

# Next Steps

1. Incorporate insights gained from this card sort into the personalization 2.0 strategy and design.
2. When we have a more defined/proposed IA, test that IA again via either a closed card sort or tree testing.
