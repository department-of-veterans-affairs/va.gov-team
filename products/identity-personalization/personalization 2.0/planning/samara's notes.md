# Initial planning

## Potential project breakdown

1. Combine Profile and Account
2. Updated My VA/Homepage approach
- MVP of internal notifications
- Homepage or dashboard 2.0 update (note: this may be in tandem with number 2 depending on how we decide to execute this project)

## Combine Profile/Account planning

This likely won't involve much pushback or conversations with other teammates, so we can probably dive into this first. 

### Planning
- Review plan with DSVA team (9/26/19)

### IA & card sort
- Create content inventory of what needs to be included in the combined Profile and Account section.
- Propose new IA.
- Review card sort results for nomenclature.
- Share proposal with Mikki and make updates.
- Create closed card sort.
- Circulate, evaluate card sort and make updates.
- Review wayfinding in logged out states and on content pages — what content pages do we need? What additional wayfinding elements do we need to add?
- Update main navigation.

### Design
- Make design updates.
- Create mockups for all states.
- Update as needed based on technical requirements and research.

### User testing 
- Plan and recruit for user testing.
- Make updates based user testing results.

### Development

- Technical discovery
- Initial build
- Updates based on user testing

### Pre-launch

- QA
- UAT
- Launch activities
- Launch

## Updated My VA/Homepage approach

- Work with Lauren, Steve, Andy, and other team members to figure out exactly what content we need to account for on a homepage/dashboard.
- Determine general approach 
  — Are we keeping My VA? Are we scrapping it? 
  - What updates, if any, need to happen to the logged in homepage? 
  - Do any stakeholders need to be involved in logged in homepage updates? 

### Notifications

#### Discussions

- Talk to Clarice about how this overlaps with her work.

#### Research

- **Do we need more research? What are our questions?**
  - What makes someone sign in to check a claim, prescription, message, etc?
  - Will people find in-app notifications useful, or do they just want email/text?
  - What other in-app notifications might be helpful?
  - What info do people want to see?
    - Thoughts from Kevin: I wonder how we might develop personas to guide our platform level thinking. E.g. "the only-health info," the "tell me everything," the "I want just the basics" vs. "I'll read the detail."

#### Design

- Take inventory of what functionality we have that we could convert into notifications.
- Determine IA and interaction design approach.
- Determine navigation changes.
- Work with copy.
- Work with visual design as needed.

#### User testing 

- Plan and recruit for user testing.
- Make updates based user testing results.

#### Development

- Technical discovery
- Initial build
- Updates based on user testing

#### Pre-launch

- QA
- UAT
