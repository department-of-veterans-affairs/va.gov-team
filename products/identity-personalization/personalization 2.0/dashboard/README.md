# Background

Prior to Spring 2018, the Vets.gov logged in experience was limited to an account page that aggregated little of the personalized information we had available to us on the site at the time. Through extensive research done by the Veteran Experience Office and other partners, we knew that veterans wanted to see and manage all benefited-related information in one place, so the newly-formed dragons/personalization team set out to create a more robust logged in experience. The My VA dashboard was launched as part of this effort and included four features — Your Applications, Track Claims, Secure Messaging, and Prescription Refills — along with links to personal records and the newly-created profile and account settings pages. 

Since then, the dashboard has grown, adding the Find VA Benefits tool and health care application tracking and enrollment statuses. But with the addition of new features, the dashboard's single-column, content page-like design has quickly become cumbersome, long, and hard to navigate. Additionally, the information architecture of the MVP dashboard divided sections by content type (eg. applications and claims) instead of by benefit, which has made it hard to track progress across a benefit lifecycle.

To fix these problems, the dragons/personalization team is planning a Dashboard 2.0 redesign. This project aims to visually redesign and restructure the existing dashboard so that content is easier to consume, updates are easier to see and track, and the dashboard is better positioned to grow and accomodate additional functionality over time.

## User Problem Statement

As a user, I want to:

- See and manage all of my benefit information in one place.
- Be able to easily see when that information has been updated or change.
- Know when there have been changes when I log into VA.gov (or be notified of such changes).

## Solution Goals

Make the following updates to the dashboard:

- Create a clearer flow that walks users through the benefit lifecycle from introduction --> application --> enrollment, and group content accordingly.
- Create a non-single column view so the page isn't so long and cumbersome.
- As needed, supplement the existing design system to create modules/elements/interactions that will give the dashboard a more "dashboard-like" feel.
- (Potentially a V2 or V3 goal) Consider combining the My VA dashboard with the logged in homepage.
