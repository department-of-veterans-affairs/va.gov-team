## Overview

We pull in a small amount of military information to the VA.gov profile. This information is read-only and uneditable, as it is offical government record.

Currently, we show:

- Branch(es) of service
- Period start dates
- Period end dates
- Multple periods of service, if applicable

## Projects

- [Integrate military information through VA Profile]()

## Backend

Military currently integrates through eMIS but will soon be moving to VA Profile.

## Design
