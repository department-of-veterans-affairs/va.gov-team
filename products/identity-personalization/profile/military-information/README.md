## Overview

We pull in a small amount of military information to the VA.gov profile. This information is read-only and uneditable, as it is offical government record.

Currently, we show:

- Branch(es) of service
- Period start dates
- Period end dates
- Multple periods of service, if applicable

## Projects

- [Integrate military information through VA Profile](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/military-information/vaprofile-integration#readme)

## Backend

Military currently integrates through [eMIS](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/EMIS.1887174669.html) but will soon be moving to [VA Profile](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/VA-Profile.1885602002.html).
