     - we looked into the 8 key data elements
     - We can likely move forward with adding:
          - periodOfServiceTypeText (active/reserves/etc.)
          - narrativeReasonForSeparationText
          - characterOfDischargeText
     - We should likely NOT proceed with:
          - Units - We already advised VBA on 12/6/2023 that the data quality for units wasn't good enough to proceed
          - militaryOccupations - based on research above this wasn't great
          - deployment locations start and end dates(no deployment data prior to 2001, )
          - training courses (not yet in the database i think)
          - Military awards and decorations (also not yet in the database)
