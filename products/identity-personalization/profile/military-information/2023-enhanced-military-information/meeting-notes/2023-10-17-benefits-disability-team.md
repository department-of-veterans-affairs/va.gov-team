# Profile and Benefits Disability Sync 

10/17/2023

## Digital vs paper 526EZ form

There are some questions on the form that are vaguely worded that request military information. Mapping that information from the profile, given the phrasing of the questions, will be tricky. 

The team is working on adding additional items to the digital form that are asked on the paper form already. 

## Process items
There are two sides of the process to keep in mind, the initial submission completed by the veteran, and the process of adjudicating the claim. 

The benefits disability team seemed to agree, showing the data elements would be helpful, but to get real value the next steps of integrating/automating into the forms to reduce manual reentry will be important. 

It's also important to make sure what we're showing veterans is shared in a way that helps adjudicators complete their portion of the process. The benefits disability team is going to share the process flows they have.


## ILER generation 
The Office of Business Integration (OBI) focuses on claims automation. The team has attempted to recreate ILER but because there isn't an API they've had a series of roadblocks. 

## Open questions 

1. How many people have ILER records?
In the call it was mentioned that the ILER database may be sparse.
