# Profile: Enhanced Military Information MVP - team sync
10/10/23

**Attendees:** Tom Harrison, Dotti Cummings, Pam Drouin, Samara Strauss, Liz Lantz, Adam Whitlock

[Stakeholder interview summary](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/military-information/discovery-and-research/2023-09-enhanced-military-info-mvp/stakeholder-interviews/stakeholder-interview-summary.md) shared with team prior to meeting.

Started by summarizing [Samara’s Slack post](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C909ZG2BB/p1696949857840889?thread_ts=1696942020.428599&cid=C909ZG2BB):
* The single biggest thing that sticks out to me is that no one has proved out that this info is actually useful to people on ~[VA.gov](http://va.gov/)~. In theory, expanded military history could help people with claims, but it is 100% not clear at this point how that would work or if this is even true.
* That being said, that does not change that there is a legislative mandate and VA is on the hook to do **something**. However, we should do our due diligence and figure out how to assess what would be most helpful before doing a massive integration of a bunch of data.
* Let's talk through some options for how to move forward. Is there any option beyond doing more research (maybe yes, maybe no, maybe there are a couple things we can do).

## Aligning on what we know
### It’s clear that VA has to do something to give people access to their ILER.
- It doesn’t **need** to be VA.gov or this team.  
- Could we give access to the PDF in the profile, via a link?
  - Would require technical discovery
  - There is concern for causing confusion for Veterans, especially since there’s not a good process for getting that updated and getting that back
    - Probably would need a carefully crafted disclaimer
    - Concern around placing strain on systems that aren’t prepared to handle corrections

### It does seem like there is potential for the enhanced military information to improve care for Veterans. 
- Can we partner with other teams to ideate on how we can leverage this to help Veterans?
  - Yes! If this is related to claims, why would we work in a vacuum?
  - We have teams who are more well versed in this than we are; let’s talk to them and hear what they’ve learned, and what they’ve heard
  - It might help us or give us more information
  - There may be research that’s already been done
  - It would also be helpful for a team (we’ll figure out who, we don’t know for sure) to have them do a demo or figure out if there is a way we can look at the process of going through a claim. We don’t even know what is asked on that form.

## Where does that leave us?
Would these things be for MVP, or would that be follow on work?
- We’re still in a discovery phase; we need to figure out what would even be useful for us to do
- If the thesis from the business side of things is that this is useful because it’ll help people fill out a disability claim, then we need to know what they’re even asking for in a disability claim.  
  - Talk to teams and find out what they know.
- We don’t really know what people even think of the military info on our site, we don’t know at scale that people are going to use that to fill out a claim..
- I don’t want us to do research forever and I think there are legitimate questions 

Ultimately, we need to prove out this hypothesis that the military info is helpful in filling out disability claims.
- The 8 exposure data points may not even be the data that’s helpful
- We should look more broadly at military info in the claims process

## Next steps
1. Continue pulling on the string of the ILER PDF. 
   - Figure out if we can get the PDF - technical discovery
   - We need to go back to Melissa - Samara will facilitate this
   - Get an example of the improved ILER

2. Let’s talk to the claims team. Even if there isn’t actual work for them to do, they should be aware of this work
   - Can they point us toward research or anything that might clarify pieces of this for us?
   - Samara will reach out to Emily as a starting point to facilitate these conversations
  
3. Dotti will set up a time with the team to write user stories and create tickets for next sprint.

## Outstanding questions
1. What is deal with the PDF in VBMS, could we use that somehow to provide people a link on VA.gov?
2. What is the corrections process for an ILER record? Are the supporting systems prepared to handle requests if this becomes available en mass on VA.gov?
3. What do claims teams know about military information (exposure data and beyond) in the claims process?
4. What is the actual claims process?
5. How are people compiling military data in the claims process?
6. Is there any existing research to help guide this work?
