### Integrate the following data into VA.gov

The MVP datapoints VA leadership is interested in adding to the VA.gov profile include the following:

1. dates of, and branches of, service (already supported)
2. units with which the Veteran or Service member served
3. deployment locations and start and end dates of deployments
4. military occupational specialties
5. training courses
6. military awards and decorations

Additionally, the following data would eventually be required, but VA leadership is currently determining requirements around this. This would not be MVP.

1. non-military deployment data
2. a registry that verifies participation in a Toxic Exposure Risk Activity (TERA) memorandum

Per VBA’s analysis, this list is composed of elements that a Veteran will need the ability to view in order to verify a TERA, hazards or presumptions. VA and DoD anticipate Veterans and Service members will most often use ILER to verify their participation in a TERA or hazards to qualify for health care benefits or compensation benefits under PACT, or previously established presumptions for:
- radiation (38 CFR 3.309(d))
- herbicides (38 CFR 3.309(e))
- contaminated water at Camp LeJeune (38 CFR.3.309(f))
- ionizing radiation (38 CFR 3.311)
- Persian Gulf exposures (38 CFR 3.317)
- fine particulate matter (38 CFR 3.320). 

The military information page in the profile should provide read access to the data elements to aid a veteran in their application process. 

### Link to ILER records

We can access a PDF version of someone's ILER record, so linking to this would suffice for MVP solution to Section 9105.

### Allow people to update their ILER record

VA leadership is not clear on how exactly to make this possible and they’re still working with their DoD counterparts to satisfactorily answer the legislative imperative in Section 803. A lightweight MVP might be giving veterans a DoD number to call. Ideally, over time, we'd have a better option than that.
