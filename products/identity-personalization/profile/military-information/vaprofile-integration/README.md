## Overview

In February 2022, we were informed that the service through which the VA.gov profile had historically (since 2018) received military information -- eMIS -- was being retired, and that military information was now fully integrated through the VA Profile backend. Our team needs to update the military information integration in the VA.gov profile to connect through VA Profile before the eMIS service is retired later in 2022.

## Problem Statement

- As a Veteran, I want to be able to see my service history when I log into VA.gov.

## User outcomes

### Desired User Outcomes

- There will be no interruptions in service, and people will be able to view their military information without issue as we transition between eMIS and VA Profile.

### Undesired User Outcomes

- There is downtime as a result of not getting this integration done on time.

## Business outcomes

### Desired Business Outcomes

- This is a win all around from a business perspective, as we already integrate much of our information through the VA Profile backend.

### Undesired Business Outcomes

- None

## Measuring success

### Objective: Update integration of military information to go through VA Profile.

**KPI**: We see at least a 95% success rate for retrieving this information from the backend.

|Field name|% of successful retrievals in first month after launch (dates TBD)| Second month after launch (dates TBD)| Third month after launch (dates TBD)|
|----------|------------|------------|------------|
|Military information| | | |
