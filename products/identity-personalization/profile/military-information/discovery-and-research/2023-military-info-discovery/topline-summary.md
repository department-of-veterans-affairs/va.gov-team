# Topline Summary: Military info, Profile

This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is **not the final result of working with the data discovered**. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered. 

**The goal of this document is:**
 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes.

## Initial Findings

### A copy of discharge paperwork (e.g. DD214) is a requirement for receiving any VA benefit or service. *While reviewing recordings as part of synthesis, I realized this is actually not always true. However, almost all participants believe this to be true (which does make it true for them, as not having a copy ends up causing them to put off application). 1/10 participants has never had a DD214, and has successfully applied for benefits.*
Simply memorizing the information on one's DD214 is insufficient. The document itself is needed to prove that one has served in the military, and not only for VA-related benefits. Veterans must also present their DD214 (or other discharge papers) to get a Veteran ID. If they don't have a Veteran ID, the DD214 is a fine substitute for accessing non-VA Veteran-only memberships, discounts, and privileges.

### Some Veterans lack easy access to their DD214.
This is especially true for Veterans experiencing homelessness. One research participant never received a DD214 (or other discharge paperwork) and some quick research on Veteran reddit provides evidence that this is not a rare occurence (to leave the military without receiving discharge paperwork). 

### Some participants had accessed a copy of their DD214 online at some point through eBenefits.
In addition to being able to download a copy of their DD214, participants were able to download other important and helpful documents, such as benefit letters. 

### Unprompted, 4/10 participants brought up confusions about their DD214.
Three participants stated that they did not know what their discharge status code actually meant, or that they were surprised to find out that a Veteran could have a less than honorable discharge but still receive a DD214. Two participants mentioned that there may be multiple versions of a DD214 and in some cases copy A is needed and in others, copy B is needed, but a lack of clarity around how copies A and B differ from one another, and when to use one over the other. 

### Contexts in which participants needed data from their DD214, but not the actual document itself were less common and less predictable. 
Participants brought up two use cases: 
1. Needing information about trainings, education, and completion dates for resumes, job applications, interviews and/or professional certifications.
2. Needing dates and locations to try to pinpoint (and prove) when and where an event took place, such as an injury or - for one participant - the birth of his son while he was serving.

### Participants like the idea of being able to access their military info (and especially their DD214) easily online.
However, all participants also complained about the login experience at VA.gov. Some participants stated that they try to avoid logging in to VA.gov whenever possible. Clearly, VA.gov does not quite fit into the category of "easy to access."

### When asked to show me where they'd expect to find their military info on VA.gov (starting from the My VA screen), participants mostly went to the search bar as their first step.
Once I directed participants to the profile link at the top of the screen, they were able to find "Military Information" in the side nav of the profile. 

### Research findings provide evidence that Veterans would benefit from having quick and easy online access to their military information, primarily: dates and locations of service, trainings and certifications (and dates of completion), discharge status, and possibly some educational content about what their status means.
Participants also asked for: branches, awards, accommodations, military academies. Others said this section of the profile should have all military info or "the entire military 201 files."
