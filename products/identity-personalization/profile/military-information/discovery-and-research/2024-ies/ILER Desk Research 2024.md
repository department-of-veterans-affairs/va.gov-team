## Research Goals

The goals of this document are **REVISE AND REORDER**: 
- to clarify terms, terminology, and background critical to understanding for this Epic (?)
- to collect the learnings and insights to date around building Veteran access to enhanced military information (specifically, the data gathered and presented by the ILER system) in the VA.gov Profile
- to document open questions at the time of this writing
- to offer recommendations for action, including communications around the nature of the information
- to document the details and required actions from the Congressional mandates for providing ILER access to Veterans
- to capture how Veterans would use their ILER information (use cases)
- to incorporate what has previously been discussed and workshopped with stakeholders

The goal of this ticket is to, based on the learnings above, offer:
- next steps
- recommendatons

## Definitions

**Individual Longitudinal Exposure Record (ILER)**

In the **strict definition**, ILER means the ILER **information technology system** that gathers data from a range of VA and DoD systems to comprise a report about a service member’s deployments and exposure to toxins. Service members have no direct interaction with this system. See the GAO report linked in Sources (PAGE NUMBER?) for details.

In **practice**, ILER has often been used, both internally and in a public-facing way, to mean the output report generated by the ILER system (see IES, below). 

ILER is jointly managed by the DoD and the VA. The DoD manages the data on ILER. 

ILER was originally meant as a research tool for clinicians and epidemiologists. It was not originally meant to be accessed or used by Veterans or Service Members, but this changed due to the PACT Act. 

The generated report is an important part of all service members’ medical history. The report tracks a service member’s deployments, how these might expose the member to environmental hazard, and keeps a record of medical encounter information. It is also used by VA and DoD healthcare providers, and by epidemiologists and researchers. Perhaps most importantly. the report is used in evaluations of disability and determinations of benefits for individual Veterans. 

Basically, the goal of the ILER system is to track and monitor exposures, leading to better treatment and outcomes for Veteran health.

For an update on the roadmap and interoprability of the ILER system, please see this update (https://www.va.gov/RAC-GWVI/meetings/Feb2023/1VARAC_DoD_Exposure_Monitoring_Wearables_ILER_4Feb23_final_sjones.pdf)

**Incident Exposure Summary (IES)**

In the **strict definition**, this is the **report** generated from this system. Service members, epidemiologists, and providers should all be able to access this document (see below). This is used in evaluations of disability and determinations of benefits. According to VEO stakeholders, VA owns an API that can generate a PDF/text version of a veteran’s ILER record. (When you see "access their ILER report", this is what this refers to.)

In **practice**, this term does not seem to be in any Veteran mental models uncovered with by formal research or by browsing discussions and documentation online. 

Recommendation: SHOULD BE JUST USE ILER? FIND A REPLACEMENT FOR THE IES USED IN ALL THESE GITHUB PAGES?

**Enhanced Military Information**

This is a working umbrella term. It encompasses access to reports generated by ILER, any summaries of ILER data and access to it, any future ability to edit or correct information in an ILER, and the initiative to design and develop these features.

**Primary stakeholder**

The primary stakeholder on this initiative is the Veterans Experience Office (VEO).

It is not critical for our work here, but there are ~17 different stakeholder groups participating in ILER functional communities, including DHA Public Health, various VA offices, Armed Services, surgeon generals, and public health directorates (MCT ILER HCD Pre-Discovery Findings_20230215.pdf)

**PACT Act**

"The PACT Act expanded VA’s list of conditions for which veterans may be awarded disability benefits if there is documentation of deployment to an area where toxic exposure events occurred. (GAO PDF, p 2)

**Joint Longitudinal Viewer**

This is "a separate web application from ILER that provides DOD and VA staff (e.g., clinicians, claims benefits staff) a read-only display of a service member’s or veteran’s health data summarized from multiple integrated sources. Staff can also access ILER summary information through this application." (GAO PDF, p 3)

**Toxic Exposure Risk Activity (TERA)**
https://www.va.gov/HEALTHBENEFITS/resources/publications/10-1745_Toxic-exposed-Veterans.pdf and https://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/ LOOK UP FOR DETAILS

### Legislative History and Congressional Mandates

On 1 January 2021, Congress passed the National Defense Authorization Act, in which Section 9105 required that Veterans shall have access to their ILER. At the time, this was mandated as read-only access.

On 10 August 2022, the PACT Act, Section 803 stated that the VA and DoD shall coordinate to allow Veterans to update the records in their ILER “as necessary”. There was no deadline for this.


DOD and VA released an initial version of ILER (version 1.0) for staff use
in October 2019. DOD and VA have subsequently released updated
versions with expanded functionalities and data sources accessible
through ILER.13 For example, version 1.1 expanded the number of data
sources feeding into ILER, and version 1.2 added further data sources
and allowed for read-only access to individuals’ ILER exposure
summaries through the Joint Longitudinal Viewer. With Version 2.3,
released in July 2023, ILER included all functionalities that the agencies
had initially planned, which included tools for research, according to DOD
and VA officials. Following this release, DOD and VA officials said they
planned to continue to make enhancements to ILER and address new
legislative requirements in future versions of the web application.14 As of
January 2024, staff were using version 2.4 (released in October 2023),
which added some of DOD’s blast overpressure data.15 Version 2.5 will
be available to staff in April 2024, according to DOD officials.

## Veteran Journey

Where does your product fit into the Veteran journey? Are there moments that matter? Key moments this research touches in the Veteran journey are:

- Taking care of my health
- Aging

## OCTO Objectives

In 2021, Congress mandated that veterans be able to view their ILER record. In 2022, as part of the PACT Act, Congress mandated that veterans be able to update this record. This desk research (and initiative) is concerned with the former.

As a result, the goal for OCTO is to design, develop, and deliver a way for Veterans to view and/or download their personal record of exposures during their service in a user-centered way. To meet this goal most effectively, the work here should focus on maximizing:
- findability
- relevance to the Veteran
- familiar context and language
- clarity on what the user should do to access/download
- clarity on what the user will access/download
- clarity on what the user can do with the access/downloaded file
- improve the readability of what we can provide (ILER reports can be very long and complicated)

This is driven by the legislative history.
Congress enacted Section 9105 on January 1, 2021, in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), to provide Veterans with read-only access to ILER.
Congress enacted Section 803 on August 10, 2022, as part of the PACT Act. Section 803(a) provides: “The Secretary of Veterans Affairs [VA] shall coordinate with the Secretary of Defense [DoD] to provide a means for Veterans to update their records as necessary to reflect exposures to occupational or environmental hazards by such member or Veteran in the [ILER].”
Section 803(b)(1) provides that to update a record under subsection (a), a Veteran shall provide such evidence as VA considers necessary. Section 803(b)(2) requires VA to promulgate a regulation defining the “evidence considered necessary.”

It is important to note that this does not specify _where_ or _by when_ should this information be made available to Veterans.

Metrics to monitor after deployment of this feature might include:
- usage metrics showing Veterans accessing this information (https://va-gov.domo.com/auth/index?redirectUrl=%2Fpage%2F1834995012%3FuserId%3D66061986)
- a reduction in time evaluating Veteran diabilities
- more efficient access to health care for Veterans in issues related to exposure
- better medical outcomes for Veterans facing issues related to exposure

## Veteran Use Cases

According to (MCT ILER HCD Pre-Discovery Findings_20230215.pdf), the four main levels of ILER use cases are:
1) A Veteran or Service Member themselves seeking an understanding of their own exposures
2) Healthcare providers in a clinical setting supporting the treatment of a Veteran or Service Member
3) Claims agents in support of adjudication
4) Researchers and epidemiologists looking to identify trends and mitigations

Use case 1) is directly within scope of this work, to informs both placement on VA.gov and how we communicate the value of the download prior to offering the download. Use case 2) is relevant and can inform our findings in that Veterans may need the ILER report available either to educate VA staff and providers of the ILER report's relevance, or to use the ILER report to help design treatment planning.

In support of the latter: according to the GAO report, "VBA requires claims benefits staff to use ILER in processing veterans’ disability claims.” We will address this below along with the research finding that though this is an important resource in disability claim filing and evaluation, many Veterans and Service Members (as well as staff) aren't familiar with either the report or its use; and some who are aware of it, do not trust the information contained in it.


"veterans will most often use ILER to certify their participation in a TERA or hazards to qualify for healthcare  benefits or compensation benefits under pact" -- from Mural
(toxic exposure risk activity )

"VEO isn't sure how veterans learned about the PDF access to ILER, their initial research veterans had no clue what it was"


MENTAL MODELS: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/Research/2024-01-military-info-enhancement-mvp/research-findings.md

 Create a customized display that would support Veteran
understanding of benefits and could empower Veterans to make
claims supported by their ILER data.
• Proactively prepare to address any Veteran confusion or
troubleshooting after Veterans access their ILER.
• Proactively prepare to support Veterans with fact sheets, FAQs, and
customized displays,

 ILER was built primarily for environmental researchers and clinicians,
making it very difficult for the layman to fully comprehend.
• The level of detail in ILER is not, in its entirety, relevant to Veterans
and yields a very long record.
• The current level of detail in ILER creates a communication risk and
potential for fear mongering; Veterans will struggle to be able to
identify the salient information.

What does this tell us?

Though access to this report is mandated by Congress, and is an important tool to help Veterans make sense of their experience, and seek to claim benefits and treatments to which they are due, it might be irresponsible or harmful to provide access without strong warnings about the difficult presentation and possible unreliability of the data. 

RECOMMENDATION FOR LATER: RESEARCH INDICATES ANY DOWNLOAD SHOULD BE BEHIND SOME FRICTION TO PRESENT THIS WARNING

WORK THROUGH FINDINGS FIRST AND CAN REFER TO THEM LATER

### Key findings

For a first gloss of understanding Veterans mental models and needs for detailed information of their service, and how this relates to what tasks they need to achieve on VA.gov, we will start with existing research work (https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/military-information/discovery-and-research/2023-military-info-discovery/findings-summary.md) conducted for the Enhanced Military Information product. In addition, we will rely on pre-discovery and discovery work conducted for the Veterans Experience Office (VEO) and by the AE team previously (see SECTION BELOW).

1. Veterans and VA staff are used to using “ILER” to refer to the report; in none of the postings from Veterans, do they use “IES”
2. Veterans use information such as what’s included in the ILER report to correct what they see as incomplete or erroneous disability ratings
3. Veterans use information such as what’s included in the ILER report to get proper health care treatments
4. Veterans may not know the ILER report exists
5. If Veterans know ILER exists, they likely don't know what it contains
6. If Veterans know ILER exists, they likely know where and/or how to access it
7. Some providers and VA staff may not know what it is or how it is related to their services, requiring the Veteran to educate them on its contents and how it's relevant (to either treatment or disability ratings)
8. Veterans distrust the data provided in many VA reports, including the ILER report
9. The mental models many Veterans have for the data in the ILER report does not match how it is organized, making it more difficult for the Veteran to achieve any of their goals or note what data are faulty

### Details of Findings

### Veterans and VA staff are used to using “ILER” to refer to the report; in none of the postings from Veterans, do they use “IES”
   
   
   **Some evidence for this**
   
According to prior research for Enhanced Military Information (https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/military-information/discovery-and-research/2023-military-info-discovery/findings-summary.md), Veterans may or may not need their DD214 when applying for VA benefits and services. 

2. Veterans use ILER/IES access in relation to benefits

Having their information of service dates and deployments application for VA benefits. (Information about potential exposures and disability ratings were outside the scope of the previous research cited.)

ADD REDDIT QUESTIONS HERE WITH CAVEATS ABOUT CANARY IN THE MINE AND RARE SAMPLE

2. Providers ask Veterans for ILER/IES information in care contexts

   **No evidence for this**

3. There is a need to format ILER data into a more readable format for Veterans
4. There is a need to learn what ILER data Veterans would need to see and how to format it

## Recommendations

1. Use ILER terminology (though technically not correct, it matches the mental models of Vets and staff)
2. Veterans need education as to what this report actually is
3. Veterans need education as to what this report can be used for
4. Veterans need reassurance that the VA is aware of data quality issues
5. Veterans would benefit from knowing the VA is working on allowing them to review and edit
6. Veterans would benefit from, in the interim, pointers to where they can request corrections to data

tho placement on the Profile is important, explanatory language and resources for the Veteran to follow up with questions will be super important to the success in a Veteran improving outcomes


THE ABOVE DON'T READ LIKE RECOMMENDATIONS; COMBINE WITH KEY FINDINGS
