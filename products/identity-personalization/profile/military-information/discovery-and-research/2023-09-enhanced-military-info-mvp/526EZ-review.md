# 526EZ review

## What is the 526EZ?

The 526EZ is the form veterans fill out to apply for disability compensation.

### How to view

1. Go to staging.va.gov.
2. Sign in with user 15 or 68.
3. Go to https://staging.va.gov/disability/file-disability-claim-form-21-526ez/introduction.
4. **Please do not submit the form**.

## Sections of the 526EZ that ask for military history and related information

There is actually only one page of the 526EZ that asks for military service history, and it's very brief. It asks for what we already have in the profile -- branch of service and related dates.

![526 military history](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/military-information/discovery-and-research/2023-09-enhanced-military-info-mvp/images/526EZ_military%20service%20history%201.jpeg)

However, there are other pages that ask for information related what happened to veterans when they were in the service:

In section 2 of the form, veterans are asked if they were ever a POW:

![526 were you a POW](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/military-information/discovery-and-research/2023-09-enhanced-military-info-mvp/images/526EZ_disabiities_pow.jpeg)

In section 2 of the form, veterans are also asked if their disability is service connected and to provide more detail to how the disability is service connected. While this page does not ask people to update official forms or records (this comes later), this might be a place where it would be helpful to have additional military history information on VA.gov. This would help people fill in the gaps of what happened without them having to rely on their memories.

Finally, people are asked to upload official records if they have them, but they are **not** asked for their DD214 or other military history documentation at this time. I am not sure whether this is sometimes asked for later as claims agents are reviewing applications.
