## Description

This section of profile allows users to review and edit the list of facilities where they currently receive care.

## When/where to show the health facilities section

- We will show this section to users who have VA health care.
- Should appear in profile nav immediately after direct deposit (as shown in [desktop mock-ups](https://preview.uxpin.com/2c99ba26116e28b032d83eb4f636b448c9bde2b2#/pages/138006241/simulate/sitemap?mode=i))

## URL

URL for this section should be [www.va.gov/profile/facilities/](http://www.va.gov/profile/facilities/) as noted in the [IA recommendations doc](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/information-architecture/ia-reviews/auth-profile-your-facilities.md#ia-structure-urls-and-breadcrumbs-).

## Design 

Initial state, before a user has made any edits, desktop and mobile (use links above for latest versions):

### Prototypes

- Use prototype links above for latest versions of design.
- Check the documentation tab on the top right side of the prototype for screen-by-screen notes. Not all screens have documentation; orange dot indicates a screen has dev notes.

### Specs

- Follow existing patterns for padding + margins from other parts of profile.

- I think this is a new pattern on desktop in that it's 2 columns (value + edit button) instead of 3 in other parts of profile (key + value + edit button).  Please keep 48px of distance between text and the edit button.

- Everything else in this section pulls from existing patterns in profile or the VA design system.  There aren't any new spacing patterns (aside from above), components or icons. For example, use the site standard to set line height and spacing between `<li>` elements.

## Copy

`h1` and `nav` item reads

> Your VA health facilities

Copy below `h1`:

> These are the facilities you go to for care. We may use this information when you [schedule an appointment online](va.gov/health-care/schedule-view-va-appointments/appointments/). You can edit this list at any time.

FAQ below list:

> How can I add a new facility?
>
> To add a new facility, you'll need to register at the facility first. Contact your nearest VA facility’s registration office to register. After you’ve completed the facility’s registration process, we’ll add the facility to your list.
