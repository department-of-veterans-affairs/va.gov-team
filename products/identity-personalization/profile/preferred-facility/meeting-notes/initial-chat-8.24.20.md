- It would be helpful to see treating facilities for the VAOS tool so that we are accurately reflecting to users the facilities that they currently go to. Right now, it sounds like we are showing them old facilities because we don't have a way to detect which ones are current. That is currently kept in MHV.
- We’d have to do some technical discovery on what is being shown in MHV profile. Why are some of the facility boxes checked and some aren’t? Is this meant to show current facilities vs. old facilities?
- For a feature in the VA.gov profile, it would be nice to show:
  - All the facilities someone has ever been to (known as where they are "registered").
  - Their current facilities.
  - Allow someone to update which are current and which are not.
  - Nice to have: Allow someone to add a new facility they have never been to.
