# Chat with Carnetta | 11.2.20

Also in attendance: Lihan Li; Lenae Storey; Lauren Ernest

- Carnetta will be our technical contact, but it doesn't sound like we should need her much. 
- While MHV has its own backend, we can pull facility data directly in through MPI. We already have an API that does this for the VAOS tool, so we can leverage the same thing for the profile.
- We will **not** be syncing the preferred facility data with MHV. After we launch our version of the feature, MHV may end up pointing veterans to our site to keep this information up to date.
- MPI also has a field called “preferred facility.” It can’t tell you veteran preference, but tells you what facility has the most transactions. Because this changes based on number of visits/interactions, it's not totally reliable as a metric for actual facility preferences.
- 3rd party system — PCMM — primary care management (something). It hangs outside of all VISTAs. This where you have every patient and their relationship to primary care and where the primary care treats people.
  - Used in VAOS for direct scheduling. It does not sound like we need this for the preferred facility work.
