## Intro 

Thanks so much for joining us today! Today we're going to talk about a new section we're adding to your profile on VA.gov.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session will be quick, it should take less than fifteen minutes.** 
- **As always, we want to hear your honest opinions.** 
- **Please go slower than you normally would and if you could talk aloud about what you are doing, that would be great.** 

## Screenshare

I'm going to send you a link to a prototype in the chat.  Please go ahead and share your screen once you've got it pulled up.

Try to move a bit slower than you normally would on a website and talk me through your actions. For these scenarios we are going to assume that you have logged-in and navigated to your profile.

## Questions

**Scenario**

*Begin on facilities page*

1. Talk to me about what you see on this page and what you can do here. 
2. Why do you think these facilities are listed here?

2. Can you show me how you would make changes to this list? 
3. What do you expect will happen once you've made changes?
4. Now that you've saved some changes, talk me through what you see on this page.
5. How would you add a VA location that's not here?

### Things to watch for:

- Is “Your VA health facilities” meaningful or do we need to consider another name for this section of profile?
- Generally, do people understand how to edit their list? Did anyone think the `edit` button would only apply to the first facility in their list?
- Did it confuse people that unselecting a facility marks it as not current?
- How do people understand the message “Note: You're registered at X other facilities where you've received care in the past....”?

## Thank-You and Closing
