# Research Plan for Profile "My VA health facilities", May 2021

## Goals	

### What product & team are you doing this research for?	

Profile "My VA health facilities", Authenticated Experience

### Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? 	

The VAOS (online scheduling) tool allows Veterans to make an appointment at all of the facilities at which they're registered, but Veterans are frustrated because being registered at a facility does not mean they are currently receiving care there. Veterans are still considered registered at facilities where they used to receive — but no longer receive — care, and at some facilities for reasons other than having ever been a patient. Therefore, Veterans see facilities in VAOS that they don't go to, and they do not understand why they are being asked to make appointments at facilities they don't go to. This has resulted in a considerable amount of complaints. 

Our MVP will add functionality to VA.gov profile to allow Veterans to set their facility preferences, which will in turn inform the list of options Veterans see when they use VAOS to schedule an appointment online.

User goals, business goals, and assumptions are listed in the [product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/preferred-facility/README.md)

### Our approach

We'll run our research in two parts: 

1. Internal mini-usability study to validate overall design and get some insights to how people understand this section of profile outside of the VAOS context.
2. External interview + usability study in conjunction with VAOS to get feedback from Veterans, and validate flow from VAOS to profile. This portion of the study will be led by the VAOS team.  We'll provide support in the following ways:

- Contributing to research plan and conversation guide
- Facilitating and note taking for some sessions
- Collaborating on synthesis

### Questions we hope to be able to answer

#### 1. Internal study

- Does our solution present any usability hurdles?
- How do people understand this section of profile outside of the VAOS context?

#### 2. External study

We'll re-validate the above questions, and hope to gain insights to these:

- What is the Veteran mental model of their facilities?
  - How do people talk about their medical facilities?
  - How do people understand this section of profile outside of the VAOS context?
- Why is it valuable to Veterans to be able to manage these facilities in their profile?
- How might they expect this information to be used outside of scheduling?
- Do people understand why the facilities in their list are there?
- Does the information we're displaying in the list provide sufficient context?

- Do people encounter any usability problems or confusion when going from VAOS to profile?

  - If a person marks a facility as preferred or current in VAOS, and then visits their profile, do they understand why their facility list has a facility marked as current and others are hidden?
  - If a Veteran leaves VAOS to update their profile, what expectations do they have for going back to schedule their appointment?

  - More questions once we see the VAOS flow...

- Do we need any static content pages to support this section of profile?
- **Bonus question to move from here to the conversation guide, if we test on mobile:** Are people easily able to navigate the profile now that the menu doesn't stick to the top of the page?

### Our hypothesis for this research study

- Labeling this section "My VA health facilities" will align with how Veterans think about their facilities.
- People will understand how to edit their list of facilities
- At first, people will be confused about why boxes are already checked.  This confusion will be easily overcome and it won't be a major usability hurdle.
- People who come from VAOS will understand this section of profile, what the facilities in their list are.
- People who have no VAOS context will be less confident about what this section of profile is, but will figure it out without much difficulty.
- *More coming pending VAOS flow*

## Method	

### What method of research are you planning? 	

Both studies will be a moderated usability study with a high-fidelity clickable prototype.  Our internal study will be 15 minutes or less.  Our external study will be 30-45 minutes.

#### Why?

This approach will allow participants to go through the prototype on their own and help us identify any usability hurdles they encounter along the way.  We can also ask follow-up questions to gain insights.

#### Where?

For our internal study, we'll use Zoom.  The VAOS team will be managing the external study (docs linked below).

#### What?

We'll test a [UX Pin prototype](https://preview.uxpin.com/2c99ba26116e28b032d83eb4f636b448c9bde2b2#/pages/138006241?mode=i).



## Participants and Recruitment	

#### What are you looking for in a participant?	  

For our internal study, we'd like to recruit co-workers who are also Veterans. The VAOS team will be managing the external study (docs linked below).

#### What is your recruitment strategy? 	

For our internal study, we'll post on Slack to recruit co-workers. The VAOS team will be managing the external study (docs linked below).

## When? 	

For our internal study, pilot test will be 4/30/21, and we'll run 5 sessions on May 3 and 4.

The VAOS team will be managing the external study (docs linked below).
