`DRAFT`

Research questions
- how do Veterans talk about their medical facilities? What words do they use?
- Is “Your VA health facilities” meaningful? ( What do we call this section of profile?)
- How do veterans understand the “note: there are X facilities you have visited that are not on this list”?
- Is it intuitive that unselecting a facility marks it as not current?
- How valuable is it to veterans to be able to manage these facilities in their profile? 
- How might they expect this information to be used outside of scheduling?
- Do we need any static content pages to support this section of profile?
