## The Problem

The VAOS (online scheduling) tool allows veterans to make an appointment at all of the facilities at which they're registered, but veterans are frustrated because being registered at a facility does not mean they are currently receiving care there. Veterans are still considered registered at facilities where they used to receive — but no longer receive — care, and at some facilities for reasons other than having ever been a patient. This is info is tracked in/pulled from MVI, which does not distinguish between current/previous facilities. Therefore, veterans see facilities in VAOS that they don't go to, and they do not understand why they are being asked to make appointments at facilities they don't go to. This has resulted in a considerable amount of complaints. 

While we can't change the historical list of facilities that is kept in MVI, we can allow veterans to indicate their current facilities so that we don't show them old facilities in the VAOS tool. This information *is* currently available on MHV, but it does not currently exist on VA.gov.

### User Goals

- As a veteran scheduling a medical appointment with VAOS, I only want to see the current facility(ies) at which I receive medical care when I am trying to schedule an appointment.
- As a veteran scheduling a medical appointment with VAOS, I want to be able to update my list of current facilities at which I receive medical care in the event that my information has changed and the list I am seeing is not accurate.

### Business Goals

- Be able to show a list of current facilities only for veternas using VAOS tool so they are not seeing old facilities at which they do not receive care.
- Allow veterans making appointments through VAOS to easily be able to update their list of current facilities in the event information has changed or the VA does not have correct information.
- Reduce the volume of complaints coming in from veterans about seeing old/out-of-date facilities in the VAOS tool.

## Assumptions

- Veterans only want to see their current facility(ies) on the VAOS tool. (Note: this is well-confirmed through veteran feedback)
- We can support preferred facilities in the VA.gov profile while the feature also exists in MHV.
- Allowing veterans to update their list of preferred facilities will reduce complaints.

## Questions

- How do we support this feature on VA.gov while it also exists on MHV? How would that technical integration work?
- Who is a technical POC we can work with for this project?
- When we say something is "saved in MHV", what does that mean? Does MHV have its own database?
- Are there examples of other features or settings that exist both on MHV and another website?

## Requirements

### In Scope

- Pull in all registered medical facilities from MVI to the VA.gov profile.
- Pull in current medical facilities from MHV.
- Allow veterans to edit and update at which facilty(ies) they currently receive medical care.
- Sync this information with MHV (read/write).
- Only show this feature to veterans who receive medical care and are registered at a VA facility.
- The list of current facilities needs to be easily consumable by the VAOS tool.

### Out of Scope

- Retirement of this feature on MHV.
- Writing back any information to MVI.

## Solution Approach

- As of October 2020, we are gathering information from MHV to learn about how this feature currently exists on their website. 
- Pending what we learned, we will have Lihan conduct technical discovery so we can determine whether we can meet the requirement of being able to keep VA.gov and MHV in sync.

## Value Propositions

- Veterans will be able to update their list of preferred facilities on VA.gov.
- After updating this information, Veterans should only see their current facilities in the VAOS tool.
- This should reduce veteran-reported pain points.
- This is a good, albeit small, step in rolling MHV functionality into VA.gov.

## KPIs

- Reduce dropoff from the facility selection page in the VAOS tool by 15%. ([Per Lenae](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C909ZG2BB/p1601989754166700?thread_ts=1601576792.114600&cid=C909ZG2BB))

# Implementation Info

## Status

- **September 2020**: Lenae/Lauren proposed this update; DEPO team reviewed and rated this feature on the DEPO product board.
- **October 2020**: Initial discovery.

## Product Decisions

- This feature will live in the VA.gov profile.
- This feature needs to co-exist/sync with the MHV version of the same feature until there's a future in which the MHV profile is retired.

## Technical Details

### How the feature works on MHV

As of the beginning of this project (October 2020), this is who the preferred medical facility feature works on MHV:

- MHV pulls in all facilities a person is registered at into their MHV profile. Someone can be registered at a facility for a number of reasons, not all of which involve receiving medical care there.
- People can then check a box to indicate at which facilities they currently receive care. This is only saved in MHV and used by MHV administrators. This information is not sent back to MVI.

### How to Access and Test
### Error Handling
## Screenshots
### Before

This feature does not currently exist on VA.gov. Here is the feature in MHV for a staging user that only is registered at one facility.

Real people can be registered at more than one facility. Here is a screenshot of what that would look like:
