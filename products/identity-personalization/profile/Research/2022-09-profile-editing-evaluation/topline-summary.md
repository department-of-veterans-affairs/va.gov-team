This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered. 

**The goal of this document is:**

 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

## Initial Findings

### Participants found little difference between editing contact information on one page compared to separate pages; both approaches were easily understood and usable.

- No participant noticed they were going to a new URL in the prototype
- Once it was pointed out, 3 participant shared concerns about bandwidth loading a new page each time.
- When discussing differences between the two approaches, the majority of participants stated they preferred to stay on one page.

### Most participants found all the alerts and modals they encountered to be useful.
- No participants were bothered or slowed down by encountering these alerts as they updated contact information.
- Many commented they were helpful and would prevent a mistake.
- Some participants moved too quickly to read the content in the alerts.

### The notification settings interface was intuitive for most participants, but the user flow and notification labels were confusing.

- All but 2 participants understood the radio button options and that their update saved without clicking a button.
	- One participant landed on the page and was immediately confused by the lack of a button, and that a radio button was already selected.
	- A screen reader participant expected a checkbox instead of a radio button and did not realize there were 2 options until prompted to look more.
- The process of adding a mobile number and then updating notification settings was not intuitive for most participants. 
	- Many missed the “manage text notifications” link in the confirmation box and weren’t sure how to get back without guidance.
	- Some thought by adding a mobile number, they had updated their notification settings and had completed the process.
- A few participants missed the “Board of Veterans’ Appeals hearing reminder” label, and thought the notification was about Applications, Claims, and Decision Reviews

### The address validation flow was easily understood, even when immediately followed by the “match mailing to home address” modal.
