# Research Plan for Authenticated Experience, Profile Editing Evaluation, September 2022

## Background
Accessibility specialists have been advocating for a “one thing per page” pattern for VA.gov forms for the last year. This pattern is known to improve the usability for complex forms by reducing cognitive load, improving error messages, reducing load times and more.

We’re considering this pattern for profile, but we’re not sure if there are actual user problems this would solve since profile has relatively simple forms. This research will help us identify usability problems that would be solved by this approach.

### OCTO Objectives 
This research supports the following [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme) :
* Logged-in users can update their personal information easily and instantly
* Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
* Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

### Veteran Journey
Our product fits into [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) at all stages. Veterans have personal information on file with VA from Starting Up and beyond.

## Research Goals	
1. Learn whether or not our edit-in-place pattern presents major usability problems for people with cognitive disabilities on mobile devices.
2. Identify any other usability hurdles in profile.

**Note:** In this study, we’re going to test with a group of Veterans that would be most likely to have challenges with edit in place functionality: people with cognitive disabilities, those who use assistive technology, and those who have limited screen real estate.  These are the people we are referring to when we say “people” throughout the rest of this document.

### Outcome
The findings from this research will help our team understand how well our current profile editing pattern supports self-service for managing personal information. We’ll use these findings to plan future iterations.

### Research questions
1. What challenges do people encounter related to in-line editing, especially address information and notification preferences?
2. How easily can people understand and navigate address validation?
3. Do people encounter any usability hurdles with updating notification settings?

### Hypothesis
* people will be able to easily update 1-2 field forms (such as phone number) with in-line editing
* People will encounter usability hurdles with more complex forms/flows such as address validation
* People will not encounter significant usability hurdles when updating their notification settings
* If a people can edit their profile without major challenges, we can be more confident our edit-in-place pattern works well for *all* Veterans.

## Method	
We’ll conduct this research through moderated usability testing by having people log into VA.gov on a mobile device.

If we have time in the session, we’ll also review a prototype with the participant.

### Location
The research will be conducted remotely over Zoom, using Perigean’s account.

## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach
Our recruitment will focus on people with cognitive disabilities, and people who use assistive technology, as well as groups that have been underrepresented in VA research to date.
