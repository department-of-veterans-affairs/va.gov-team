Moderator: I’m gonna have you start screen sharing with me, and I can help you to do that if you're not sure how.

[talks participant through screen sharing and logging into the staging site]

Here we are. So first i'm curious you mentioned that you normally have to, you know, zoom in or magnify things if the font is too small.  How is this font size for you?

Participant:
Good. it's good so far.

Moderator:
So go ahead and update the contact information you see here except for mailing address. You can choose any other field. you don't need to use your real information. But you can if that's easiest for you to put in things that you know versus making things. We’ll remove everything when we're done.

[participant clicks edit button for home address, manually types information into fields]

[participant clicks update button and triggers address validation, does not make selection]

[participant clicks edit button for next section and triggers currently editing modal]

[participant reads currently editing modal, clicks OK, and then goes back to address validation. Hovers over “use this address” button]

Moderator:
Can you tell me a little bit about what you're seeing up there, and what that means to you?

Participant:
[reading] Please confirm your address. It’s not a real address.

Moderator:
Okay. Is that information clear to you? 

Participant:
Yes.

Moderator:
okay, you can go ahead and continue

[Participant clicks “use this address” and triggers modal to sync mailing and home address]

Moderator:
And what does this mean to you?

Participant:
Its asking if I want to update this with my mailing address.

Moderator:
Okay, and if this was your real information, which would you choose?

Participant:
Yes.

Moderator:
Okay, you can go ahead and choose no for the purposes of our test today. Just so we don't have that mailing address feel safe but it's good to know kind of what you what you would do normally you can go ahead and continue.

[Participant easily adds home number and mobile phone number]

Moderator:
Okay, and i'll i'll have to go ahead and stop there. Can you talk to me about the process of doing that? How did that feel for you? 

Participant:
Pretty simple.

Moderator:
What did you think about the various prompts that you encountered along the way?

Participant:
I didn’t see any prompts.

Moderator:
Oh, i'm referring to the alerts that came up that said, you know you're editing another field you're add this address valid,  asking to confirm your address. and then the other one was, Do you want to update your home and or your mailing address to match your home address.

Participant:
 I think it's it's okay. 

Moderator:
is there anything challenging about it?

Participant:
No.

Moderator:
Okay, and okay. So now i'm gonna have you go ahead and  remove the information that you've added.

[Participant clicks remove button and triggers are you sure modal]

Moderator:
Is this clear to you? 

Participant:
Yeah so it's clear 

Moderator:
Okay, good

[participant continues to remove information]

Okay, thank you for doing that Next i'll have you update your notification settings.

[participant navigates to notification settings with guidance from moderator]

Imagine you had set out to update your own notification settings, and just show me what you would do.

[Participant clicks “add mobile number” link in alert and begins to add a mobile number. Uses a fake number and hits update. Error message displays saying “we can’t make this update because we currently only support US based numbers]

Moderator:
Hmm.  What happened there? 

Participent:
Hmm, Not a us area code. [updates area code and successfully saves]

[Participant clicks “manage text notifications” link in alert unprompted]

Moderator:
And then from here. i'm just interested to see how the changing the setting works for you. So you can just go ahead and change the setting

[Participant clicks radio button on notification settings]

Moderator:
Okay, and talk to me about how this aligns with your expectations of updating notifications

Participant:
It wasn't too difficult. You just have to have a US phone number 

Moderator:
Okay, And is this pretty clear to you that your notification settings are updated?

Participant:
Yes, it says it here. 

Moderator:
Okay. Okay, great. Well, that is that's everything I wanna just show you on this particular website i'll have you go back and  remove the phone number again and then log out.

[Participant signs out. Moderator has participant switch to mobile device and guides them to prototype. Asks them to update home phone number and mailing address]

[Participant goes through mailing address ad home phone number without problems]

Moderator:
Talk to me about any differences that you notice between the website and this prototype.

Participant:
I didn't see any prompts. You know how the other one said “this will affect the different things”

Moderator: 
Yes, when you were removing information.

Participant:
So you don’t know what effects this has when you make changes here.

Moderator:
Any other differences that you notice?

Participant:
No. 

Moderator:
Okay, And would it be okay with you if I have you go back to the other website on your phone?

[guides participant back to staging and has them log in, and reposition their camera]

moderator:
Go ahead and update your contact information once more, I’m curious how it works for you on a smaller screen.

[participant goes ahead with update. Updates home phone. Then encounters “we can’t update right now” error when attempting to update home phone]

Moderator:
Hmm. What happened there? 

Participant:
[reads] We’re sorry we can't update your information right now. We’re working to fix this problem. Please check back later.

Moderator:
Okay, now, what would you do?

[Participant tries to save again]

Moderator:
Okay, So how does this feel on a mobile phone to you? Going through the process of editing the contact information.

Participant:
It’s the same process, just a smaller screen.

Moderator:
How does that impact your ability to read it? 

Participant:
It It does not. My phone is adjusted to my sight. so it's Okay.

Moderator:
Let me double check my notes here. you can go ahead and remove that address that you added. That's everything I wanted to get your feedback on today. Do you have any any comments or questions? 

Participant:
No. 

Moderator:
Was there anything challenging about that experience of editing your contact information?

Participant:
No. Making up information was the hardest part.
