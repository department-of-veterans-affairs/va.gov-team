# Conversation Guide for Profile Editing Evaluation, September 2022

## Moderator logistics
- Use [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/messages/C40B45NJK/details/) in 
Slack for real-time feedback from observers.
- Mute your Slack notifications.
- Send out the [observer instructions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Observer-guidelines.1622311177.html) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel)).



### Starting the session

- In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute.
- Keep observers in the waiting room
- In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked
- Check your screensharing setup and share permissions for participants.
- When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*


## Intro - 3 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Liz and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues who would like to observe and take notes. Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I want to be sure before we get going. Are you okay with a [number] additional observers during this session?

- If participant does not consent, use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
- If participant consents, admit observers. 
   - Ask notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)
   - Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth

Today we're going to talk about making updates to the personal information VA has on file for you.  We’re interested to learn how our current pages support Veterans on their phone when they need to make updates.

*If Veteran has joined from a desktop/laptop:* Do you have a mobile device available you can use for the session? You don’t have to join from Zoom on the phone, but I’d like you to review the website on a phone.

*If yes:* Explore laptop hugging method, or have them show you on their phone what they’re doing.

*If no:* End the session

*Before we start, a few things I want to mention:*

- **This entire session should take about 35-40 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- I’ll be asking you to log into your VA.gov account today and share your screen, which means we’ll see some of your personal information. Is that OK with you? /If not, end the session./
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 
- **I’m also going to turn on transcriptions to improve our notes; you should be able to control them on your end too.**

*Turn on transcription*

## First Task: Update contact information - 10 minutes
Can you please start screen sharing with me? I can help you do that if you’re not sure how.

*Once screen sharing has begun*

I’d like for you to update your contact information on VA.gov. Do you know where to do that? If not, I can share a link. 

*Paste a link in the chat, or verbally tell the participant where to go. They’ll need to go through the sign-in process before they get to profile.*

*Pause recording during sign in process*

- Go ahead and start updating your contact information. 
If it’s correct, just change something small. We’ll correct it all at the end. *Have participant update at least 3 pieces of contact information. One must be an address.*
- If needed, have them trigger address validation flow by intentionally entering data to make the address incorrect. An incorrect zip code will usually do the trick.
- If needed, have them trigger the “Are you sure?” modal by clicking cancel before saving
- Moderator: ask follow-up questions to understand the participants experience. For example:
	* Clarify any hesitation spots
	* What was difficult about making those updates?
	* How does it align with your expectations?

### Things to watch for:
- Did the participant encounter any challenges in updating information?
- Did they get confused by having all of the forms on one page?
- How did they react to the validation flow?
- Note what changes they made so you can guide them to correcting them at the end of the session, if needed.
- Did any alerts get triggered during their updates?  “e.g. Are you sure?”

## Second Task: Reverse any unwanted changes in contact information - 5 minutes
- Let’s go back to your contact information and make sure it is all actually accurate and the way you want it.

## Third Task: Update notification settings - 5 minutes
Next, I’ll have you update your VA notification settings. If they’re already set the way you want them, go ahead and change them anyway, and then set them back the way you want them.

### Things to watch for:
- Did the participant encounter any challenges in navigating to notification settings?
- Did the participant encounter any challenges in updating information?
- Moderator: ask follow-up questions to understand the participants experience. For example:
	* Clarifying hesitation spots
	* What was difficult about making those updates?
	* How does it align with expectations?

## Fourth Task: Review prototype - 5 minutes
Now I’d like to get your feedback on a prototype. It’s very basic but hopefully it will give you an idea of another approach to editing contact information. Since it’s a prototype, it won’t work exactly the way you might expect.

Go to bit.ly/vap917

- See how you would edit your mailing address and home phone number.
- What are your thoughts on this approach?

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

- Talk to me about your overall experience editing contact information
- What was challenging about that?
- When have you needed to update your contact info on VA.gov?

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future usability research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
