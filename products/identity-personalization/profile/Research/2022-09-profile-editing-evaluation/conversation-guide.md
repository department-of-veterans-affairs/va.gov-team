# Conversation Guide for Profile Editing Evaluation, September 2022

## Moderator logistics
1. Start a thread in [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/messages/C40B45NJK/details/) in Slack for real-time feedback from observers.
2. Add the [research questions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/Research/2022-09-profile-editing-evaluation/research-plan.md#research-questions) to the session thread, and remind observers you’ll be asking them to post their top 3 insights from the session in the slack thread.
3. Send out the [observer instructions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Observer-guidelines.1622311177.html) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel)).
4. Mute your Slack notifications.

### Starting the session
- In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute.
- Keep observers in the waiting room
- In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked
- Check your screensharing setup and share permissions for participants.
- When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*

## Intro - 3 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Liz and Brooks is taking notes.
There are members from the website team who would like to hear your feedback firsthand during our session. Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I want to be sure before we get going. Are you okay with observers joining this session?

****
- If participant does not consent, use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
- If participant consents, admit observers. 
- Ask notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction.
- Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras and mics for remainder of the session to save bandwidth.
****

Today we're going to talk about making updates to the personal information VA has on file for you.  We’re interested to learn how our current pages support Veterans on their phone when they need to make updates.

**For AT/Magnification sessions**
As part of signing up for the session, we asked if you need (assistive technology/magnification) to use the internet. According to my notes, you normally use [whatever participant has said]. Can you tell me more about that?

Are you able to use that during our session today?

OK, that sounds good.

**If Veteran has joined from a desktop/laptop, and they are not using magnification or a screen reader:** Do you have a mobile device available you can use for the session? You don’t have to join from Zoom on the phone, but I’d like you to review the website on a phone.

*If yes, and they don’t join from Zoom: Explore laptop hugging method, or have them show you on their phone what they’re doing.*

*If no: End the session. This research is scoped only to AT desktop users, or non-AT mobile users.*

Before we start, there are a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 35-40 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 
- **I’m also going to turn on transcriptions to improve our notes; you should be able to control them on your end too.**

*Turn on transcription*

## First Task: Update contact information - 10 minutes
*If not using laptop hugging method:* Can you please start screen sharing with me? I can help you do that if you’re not sure how.

*Once screen sharing has begun*

I’d like you to go to a test website and log in. Do you prefer if I send you the link in the chat or tell it to you so you can type it in?
*Link*
- bit.ly/va0922 (goes to staging.va.gov/profile/contact-information)

*Paste a link in the chat, or verbally tell the participant where to go. They’ll need to go through the sign-in process before they get to profile.*

Use Login.gov to sign in
Email address is vagovfeedback@gmail.com
Password is vagovsite123

*give participant 2FA code sent over text, or back-up codes (moderators have these)*
****
*Here’s how to use the back-up codes with a participant:*
	* After they enter UN and PW, press “continue”
	* On the screen where it asks “Enter Your Security Code”, have them click on the “choose another authentication method” under the bold “**Can’t use your phone?”**heading
	* Choose “Backup codes” (3rd option)
	* Enter one of the codes above
****
**If staging doesn’t work:**
- Do you have a va.gov account of your own you’d be comfortable logging in with? We will see and change your contact information but we can revert it back to normal when we’re done.
- If no, end the session
****

- Go ahead and updating the contact information you see here - you can start with any field **except mailing address.** You don’t need to use your real information, but you can if that’s easy for you.  We’ll remove all if it when we’re done.
- If needed, have them trigger address validation flow by intentionally entering data to make the home address incorrect. An incorrect zip code will usually do the trick.
- If needed, have them trigger the “Are you sure?” modal by clicking cancel before saving.
- If needed, have them trigger the “Editing another section” modal by clicking “Edit” in another section before saving.
- Moderator: ask follow-up questions to understand the participants experience. For example:
	* Clarify any hesitation spots
	* What was difficult about making those updates?
	* How does it align with your expectations?

### Things to watch for:
- Did the participant encounter any challenges in updating information?
- Did they get confused by having all of the forms on one page?
- How did they react to the validation flow?
- Note what changes they made so you can guide them to correcting them at the end of the session, if needed.
- Did any alerts get triggered during their updates?  “e.g. Are you sure?”

## Second Task: Remove information added - 3 minutes
- Let’s remove all the information you added now.

## Third Task: Update notification settings - 5 minutes
Next, I’ll have you update the notification settings. If they’re already set the way you want them, go ahead and change them anyway, and then set them back the way you want them.

### Things to watch for:
- Did the participant encounter any challenges in navigating to notification settings?
- Did the participant encounter any challenges in updating information?
- Moderator: ask follow-up questions to understand the participants experience. For example:
	* Clarifying hesitation spots
	* What was difficult about making those updates?
	* How does it align with expectations?

## Fourth Task: Review prototype - 5 minutes
- Next I’ll have you log out of that testing site. Click on “Sam” in the corner, and then hit sign out.

- Now I’d like to get your feedback on a prototype. It’s very basic but hopefully it will give you an idea of another approach to editing contact information. Since it’s a prototype, it won’t work exactly the way you might expect.

Go to bit.ly/vap917

- See how you would edit your mailing address and home phone number.
- What are your thoughts on this approach?
-  What are some of the differences you noticed between the prototype and the website?
- *If needed:* Did you notice the prototype takes you to a new page for each step vs on the website it was all in one page?

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes
- Talk to me about your overall experience editing contact information
- What was challenging about that?
- When have you needed to update your contact info on VA.gov?

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes
*Moderator: Download the transcript from zoom! Ask observers in the Slack thread to post their top observations.*

That was everything I wanted to get your feedback on today. We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! One thing to be on the lookout for - Perigean will be sending you something you can share to provide the opportunity to participate in research to other Veterans in your personal network. It’s so valuable for us to have the opportunity to include Veterans in our process.

## Emergency Exit
[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
