# **Background**<a id="background"></a>

The Core Veteran Experience Crew ensures Veterans and beneficiaries have a cohesive logged-in experience across and within the current mobile and web modalities. The crew seeks to do this by developing and curating a personalized view of the Veteran’s and beneficiary’s information so they can easily understand their benefits and take action to manage and update their account and benefits. We aim to aggregate and elevate personalized tasks and information relevant to Veterans on VA.gov and the Flagship Health & Benefits Mobile app so Veterans and beneficiaries can quickly get a snapshot of their existing business with VA.

## **2025 OCTO Priorities**

**Objective 1:** VA’s digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.

**Objective 2:** OCTO’s platforms are the fastest, most efficient, and most secure way to deliver products at VA.

[2025 OCTO Priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202025.md)


## **Veteran journey**

Any time a Veteran, family members, and caregivers sign into VA.gov they encounter the authenticated experience. This can encompass a Veterans journey anytime from ‘Getting out’ to ‘Dying’.

Full [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) for reference.


# **Research overview**<a id="research-overview"></a>

## **Goals**

- Evaluate existing research within the Profile GitHub repository to create a unified understanding of identified opportunities within the experience.


## **Outcome**

- Report of user themes and opportunities for the Authenticated Experience team.


## **Research questions**

- In previous studies, what received positive feedback from Veterans on the Profile? What received negative feedback?

- What tasks do Veterans expect to accomplish on the Profile?

- Are Veterans able to successfully navigate to the Profile?

- What open questions do we still need to answer about the Profile?

- What guidelines can we create from prior research that can provide a sustainable, expandable, information structure?


## **Hypothesis**

- There will be consistent feedback from Veterans on areas of opportunity with the VA.gov Profile experience.


# **Methodology**

**Desk research (DR)**/ Review of existing research in the Profile repository. As well as any additional research from other teams found in the VA Research Repository.


# **Key Findings**<a id="key-findings"></a>

**Veteran Expectations**

1. **Veterans want VA.gov to be a ‘one-stop shop’** for all their personal information and documents.

2. Veterans **expect that VA has access to all the information and records**, and updates made to their VA.gov Profile will reflect across all VA entities.

**Experience Feedback**

3. Veterans **lack awareness of the content available in the VA.gov Profile**, which can lead to navigational challenges on VA.gov.

4. Veterans **want the ability to edit all information shown in the VA.gov Profile**, but understand written directions on how to edit their information if online editing is not available.

5. System delays in updating information in the VA.gov Profile led to participants **missing messages or assuming the experience is broken.**

6. There are **several successfully tested design patterns** in the VA.gov Profile that the team should continue to follow, including:

   1. Grouping **uneditable information separate from and editable information.**

   2. **Making it clear** what information is optional or required.

   3. **Provide inline editing**, which has had no participant challenges.

   4. **Provide FAQs to answer common questions** such as ‘Why does the VA want that information?’ or ‘How does a VA process work?’.

7. The top two features mentioned as missing from VA.gov Profile were **Dependents and Letters/Records**. Veteran feedback is supported by analytics as ‘dependents’ and ‘letters’ are two of the top searches from the VA.gov Profile. Three notable mentions are Financial information, Notifications hub, and additional Health care information.

## **Experience Feedback**

3. Veterans **lack awareness of content available in the Profile**, which can lead to navigational challenges on VA.gov. Examples of content Veterans were unaware of included:

   1. The ability to update their address. Most updated through either My HealtheVet, eBenefits, in-person at a VA facility, or by phone call.

   2. Accessing their service history information.

   3. Direct deposit information.

   4. Notification settings, but this was due to Veterans having never managed the notification settings for the messages they currently receive.

4. Veterans **want the ability to edit all information shown in the Profile**, but understand written directions on how to edit their information if online editing is not available.

   1. When editing their information in the Profile, Veterans want concrete indicators that updates they made are successful.

   2. Veterans want clear direction on what will occur when their information is added or removed from their Profile. Not having this direction causes confusion and concern.

### New Features

7. The top two features mentioned as missing from VA.gov Profile were **Dependents and Letters/Records**. Veteran feedback is supported by analytics as ‘dependents’ and ‘letters’ are two of the top searches from Profile. Three notable mentions are Financial information, Notifications hub, and Health care information.

   1. [04/2020 Combining Profile and Account Research Findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/Combine%20Profile%20and%20Account/Research/2020-03-profile-redesign/cpaa-research-findings.md)

8. Dependents: Incorporating dependents into the Profile should **include viewing and editing current and past dependents.**

   1. Dependents should include caregivers, spouses, survivors, and dependents.

   2. The team should keep in mind that **not all of these individuals** are ‘family members’ and should be mindful of naming conventions.

      1. [06/2023 Discovery summary: adding records and dependents to profile, June 2023](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/Research/2023-06-add-dependents-records-discovery/summary.md)

9. Letters: Veterans struggle to articulate the differences between VA letters, and **expect to find “basically every letter the VA ever mailed to me” in their accounts.**

   1. If the section references ‘Records’, Veterans also expect to see Medical Records.

      1. [06/2023 Discovery summary: adding records and dependents to profile, June 2023](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/Research/2023-06-add-dependents-records-discovery/summary.md)

10. Financial information: Veterans **want to be able to see all of their financial information in one place**, whether it's 'money-in' or 'money-out'. For VA.gov Profile it was recommended to include:

    1. [11/2021 Payment history/financial information Discovery (WIP)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/payment-history/discovery-and-research/payment-history-discovery.md)

11. Notifications hub: Whether in the Profile or My VA **there is a distinct need for a notifications hub.** Below are best practices for implementing a notifications feature.

    1. When designing notifications for users keep these best practices in mind:

       1. Give users control over notifications.

       2. Create actionable notifications.

       3. Customize the content.

          1. [2018 Notification best practices](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/onsite-notifications/2018-notifications-work/Discovery/Notification%20best%20practices.md)

    2. Notification center should only be for things VA has done (eg. updated a claim; made a payment, etc.), reminders, or VA informational updates.

       1. [2018 Notifications Comparative Analysis](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/onsite-notifications/2018-notifications-work/Notification%20Center/Discovery/Comparative%20Analysis.md)

    3. Participants were happy with four notification groups:

       1. Applications, claims, decision reviews, and appeals

       2. Benefit payment and debts

       3. General VA information and updates

       4. Your health care

          1. [07/2021 Profile Notification Settings Research Findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/notification-preferences/discovery-and-research/usability-june-2021/notifications-research-findings.md)

12. Health care information: There are several missing pieces of **health care related information Veterans expect within the Profile** listed below.

    1. [04/2022 My HealtheVet (MHV) Personal Information Discovery - User Interviews, Topline Summary](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/Research/2022-05-MHV-profile-research/mhv-user-interviews/topline-summary.md)


| **Integrated into VA.gov Profile**                      | **Not integrated into VA.gov Profile**    |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |

### Authenticated Navigation

1. **Most participants navigated to the Profile using the authenticated menu**, while some used My VA.

   1. _Note: We are unsure if users were navigating on a desktop or mobile device, and analytics show that navigation changes depending on device used. Will document differences in future studies._

      1. [04/2020 Combining Profile and Account Research Findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/Combine%20Profile%20and%20Account/Research/2020-03-profile-redesign/cpaa-research-findings.md)

      2. [10/2023 Profile: Multi-feature UAT and generative research findings summary](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/Research/2023-10-UAT-edit-as-subtask-default-send-checkbox-ui/findings-summary.md)

      3. [11/2023 Profile Hub Research Findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/Research/2023-10-profile-hub-usability/research-findings.md)

2. **The authenticated menu comes with several challenges**, including: findability, unclear labels, or not meeting user expectations.

   1. On the desktop view, Veterans found links for My VA and My HealtheVet duplicative due to being linked in the secondary header navigation directly below.

   2. Veterans find the term “Letter” ambiguous, and were unsure what to expect when interacting with the link.

   3. Veterans expected to find “Dependents” in their profile, rather than the authenticated menu.

   4. Veterans do like having their disability rating in the authenticated secondary header menu as they find it a critical piece of information.

      1. [11/2023 Profile Hub Research Findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/Research/2023-10-profile-hub-usability/research-findings.md)

3. **On mobile, participants had difficulty navigating** the Profile using the sub menu. While **desktop participants had no challenges** with the left navigation, and were able to quickly scan and locate pages they were looking for.

   1. Breadcrumbs were also frequently used to navigate throughout the Profile, but participants wanted the breadcrumb to reference My VA as their starting point if they came from My VA.

      1. [04/2020 Combining Profile and Account Research Findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/Combine%20Profile%20and%20Account/Research/2020-03-profile-redesign/cpaa-research-findings.md)

4. **Deep links, such as the ‘Learn how to request your DD214’ are useful on Profile.** None of the participants who returned to the Profile hub after clicking on the deep link were confused.

   1. [11/2023 Profile Hub Research Findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/Research/2023-10-profile-hub-usability/research-findings.md)


### Personal information

1. Some participants **were not confident that personal information would be used for their benefit** (specifically, pronouns, sexual orientation, sex assigned at birth, and preferred name). Including concerns of being treated unfairly by staff, or alienating certain individuals.

   1. The ability to remove the information completely from their Profile increased their comfort level.

   2. _Note: Pronouns, sexual orientation, and sex assigned at birth are no longer in the VA.gov Profile._

### Contact information

2. Participants expect the email address shown in their account to be their sign-in email address. **Having a separate email address causes confusion.**

   1. [04/2020 Combining Profile and Account Research Findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/Combine%20Profile%20and%20Account/Research/2020-03-profile-redesign/cpaa-research-findings.md)

3. **There is mixed feedback on address validation.** Some participants had no challenges updating and matching their address, and found the suggested addresses helpful even though they didn't know (or care) where they came from.

   1. Other participants wanted more information about why an address was ‘invalid’ and wanted direction on how to fix it.

   2. _Note: From a technical perspective, we don't have the ability to tell users what might be wrong with their address. The backend does not provide specific details as to what causes the ‘invalid’ determination._

### Personal health care contacts

1. Participants **expected their Emergency contact and Next of kin information** to be in either the Personal information or Contact information section of the VA.gov Profile.

   1. [11/2023 Profile Hub Research Findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/Research/2023-10-profile-hub-usability/research-findings.md)

2. Most participants associated Next of kin with family and **initially did not differentiate between** Medical emergency contact and Next of kin contact.

   1. [12/2023 Personal Health Care Contacts Research Findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/personal-health-care-contacts/discovery-research/2023-10-personal-health-care-contacts-usability/findings-report.md)

3. All participants **wanted at least two Medical emergency contacts** and most participants **wanted multiple Next of kin contacts** listed.

   1. [12/2023 Personal Health Care Contacts Research Findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/personal-health-care-contacts/discovery-research/2023-10-personal-health-care-contacts-usability/findings-report.md)

4. Participants **considered "name" and "phone number(s)" as crucial information** within both the Medical emergency contact and Next of kin contact sections.

   1. Some found "relationship" as important. So the VA would have more context when reaching out to the person.

      1. [12/2023 Personal Health Care Contacts Research Findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/personal-health-care-contacts/discovery-research/2023-10-personal-health-care-contacts-usability/findings-report.md)

5. Participants clearly understood that both the Medical Emergency contact and Next of kin contact were **specifically associated with health care.**

   1. [12/2023 Personal Health Care Contacts Research Findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/personal-health-care-contacts/discovery-research/2023-10-personal-health-care-contacts-usability/findings-report.md)


### Military information

1. Participants expected ‘Military information’ to include their service history, as well as their personal details, such as a social security number, demographics, medical, disability, and medications. **Participants' understanding of ‘Service history’ better aligned with what is present on the page.**

   1. [03/2023 Military Info, Profile Research Findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/military-information/discovery-and-research/2023-military-info-discovery/findings-summary.md)

2. **Veterans are not able to memorize all the service history information they need** to apply for common VA benefits.

   1. [03/2023 Military Info, Profile Research Findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/military-information/discovery-and-research/2023-military-info-discovery/findings-summary.md)

3. There were several requests for additional information on the Military information section, including (\*most mentioned on are starred):

   1. Battlefield/field promotion: An advancement in military rank that occurs while deployed in combat. [Link to definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlefield_promotion)

   2. **\*DD214** direct download.

   3. **\*Deployment locations:** Deployment is the movement of military units or individual service members to locations outside of the continental U.S. and its territories for the purposes of accomplishing specific missions. [Link to definition](https://www.todaysmilitary.com/life-in-the-military/relocation-deployment/duty-stations-deployment)

      1. \*Range of start and end dates of deployments.

   4. **\*Duty stations:** Typically bases or other installations where service members both live and perform their work. [Link to definition](https://www.todaysmilitary.com/life-in-the-military/relocation-deployment/duty-stations-deployment)

   5. **\*Military awards and decorations**

   6. **\*Military occupational specialties (MOS):** Assigned job specialties the service member is expected to perform. [Link to definition](https://www.militaryonesource.mil/military-basics/millife-essentials/changing-mos-jobs-in-the-military/)

   7. Military rank

   8. Other names served under

   9. Prisoner of War (PoW) locations and dates

   10. Service number: Used by the United States Department of Defense as the primary means of service member identification from 1918 until 1974. [Link to definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_number_\(United_States_Armed_Forces\))

   11. Toxic Exposure Risk Activity (TERA) memorandum: Proof of toxic exposure for PACT Act purposes. [Link to definition](https://vaclaimsinsider.com/what-is-a-va-tera-memorandum/)

   12. _Note: Branch of service, Duty status, and Service date range were frequently mentioned and are in the current Profile._

4. **Veterans believe that they need their DD214** (not just the information on it) to apply for any VA benefit or service. It's not rare for Veterans to lack easy access to their original DD214.

   1. [03/2023 Military Info, Profile Research Findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/military-information/discovery-and-research/2023-military-info-discovery/findings-summary.md)

5. Participants are **confused about the Service date range** that shows in the Military information section of the Profile.

   1. [03/2023 Military Info, Profile Research Findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/military-information/discovery-and-research/2023-military-info-discovery/findings-summary.md)

6. Veterans also **expected to find their Veteran ID Cards within a Letters and documents section.**

   1. [06/2023 Discovery summary: adding records and dependents to profile, June 2023](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/Research/2023-06-add-dependents-records-discovery/summary.md)

**Military information: ILER IES**

7. For ILER data quality review [03/2024 Enhanced Military Information Research Findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/Research/2024-01-military-info-enhancement-mvp/research-findings.md).

8. Veterans use information from the ILER IES report to **support disability compensation claims and decision reviews, and to receive proper health care treatments.**

   1. [08/2024 ILER IES Report, Desk Research Findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/military-information/discovery-and-research/2024-ies/ILER%20Desk%20Research%202024.md)

9. Veterans **expect to find their exposure record alongside related information**, such as their existing VA health records and through the Airborne Hazards and Open Burn Pit Registry sites.

   1. [10/2023 Enhanced military information MVP, desk research summary](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/military-information/discovery-and-research/2023-09-enhanced-military-info-mvp/desk-research-summary.md)

   2. [08/2024 ILER IES Report, Desk Research Findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/military-information/discovery-and-research/2024-ies/ILER%20Desk%20Research%202024.md)

10. There is an **expectation that the full ILER records will be interactive, and display information longitudinally**—across years, geographies and occupations—to aid in understanding. Minimum, a search and/or filter feature will be a requirement for the experience.

    1. When conceptualizing their military history, most Veterans think of their location first, rather than what they were doing (MOS). Due to the fact that Duty Station, Unit Assignments, Deployments, Command, and Bootcamp all serve as examples of significant locations within their military histories.

       1. [10/2023 Enhanced military information MVP, desk research summary](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/military-information/discovery-and-research/2023-09-enhanced-military-info-mvp/desk-research-summary.md)

11. The following eight data points are **more useful to VBA to surface than the whole ILER**, because they’re what VBA looks at when processing PACT Act claims, or TERA (Toxic Exposure Related Activity).

    1. Dates and branches of service,

    2. Units with which the Veteran or Service member served,

    3. Deployment locations and start and end dates of deployments,

    4. Military occupational specialties (MOS),

    5. Training courses,

    6. Military awards and decorations,

    7. Non-military deployment data,

    8. A registry that verifies participation in a TERA.

[10/2023 Profile: Enhanced Military Information MVP - Stakeholder Interview Summary](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/military-information/discovery-and-research/2023-09-enhanced-military-info-mvp/stakeholder-interviews/stakeholder-interview-summary.md)

12. Veterans and VA staff are used to using “ILER” to refer to the report; in none of the postings from Veterans, do they use “IES”. In practical terms, this means **the report should be referenced as “ILER IES”.** Additional adoption challenges include:

    1. Veterans may not know the ILER IES report exists.

    2. Veterans may not know where or how to access their ILER IES report.

    3. Veterans may not know what the ILER IES report contains.

    4. Veterans distrust the data provided in many VA reports.

    5. The ILER IES report does not match Veterans mental models, making it difficult to use.

       1. [08/2024 ILER IES Report, Desk Research Findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/military-information/discovery-and-research/2024-ies/ILER%20Desk%20Research%202024.md)


### Direct deposit information

1. **Participants missed the alert about bank fraud.** Previous team recommended moving the fraud messaging into the boxes.

1) [12/2020 Research analysis of usability testing of Direct Deposit for Educational Payments (DD-EDU) feature](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/direct-deposit/edu-direct-deposit/design/usability-testing/dd-edu-synthesis.md)


### Notification settings

1. Participants **expected notifications to be available by both text and email.** Many didn't understand why categories didn’t offer both options if they had a mobile number or email on file.

   1. [07/2021 Profile Notification Settings Research Findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/notification-preferences/discovery-and-research/usability-june-2021/notifications-research-findings.md)

2. Participants **expected to update their phone and email inline** with the Notification settings page.

   1. _Note: The current experience directs users to a one page flow with a single input field. While the experience passed UAT, it did cause some confusion why only one field, and the mention of profile led participants to believe they should be seeing more._

### Account security

1. Participants expected sign-in information, including email, to live in Account security.

   1. [04/2020 Combining Profile and Account Research Findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/Combine%20Profile%20and%20Account/Research/2020-03-profile-redesign/cpaa-research-findings.md)


### Connected apps

Highlighting all findings that were fixed based on research findings.


## **Experience Feedback**

### Navigation

1. **FEEDBACK:** One screen reader participant encountered difficulty with the body and link text within the Profile hub cards due to repetitive word choices. Using ‘manage’ at the beginning of the description gives the impression that it might be a link, and when navigating to the actual link it sounds like a repetition.

   1. **SOLUTION:** The experience no longer references multiple mentions of ‘Manage’.

### Personal health care contacts

1. **FEEDBACK:** "Medical" in Medical emergency contact caused confusion with some participants. All participants understood the term Emergency contact.

   1. **SOLUTION:** Team changed name of section to ‘Emergency contact’.

### Military information

1. **FEEDBACK:** Veterans expressed interest in digital Veteran ID Cards, even though they all wanted a plastic card as well.

   1. **SOLUTION:** Team incorporated a digital Veteran ID Card in the Military Information section.
