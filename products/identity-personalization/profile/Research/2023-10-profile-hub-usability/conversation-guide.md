# Conversation Guide: Profile hub, October 2023

## Moderator logistics

1. Start a thread in #[feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/messages/C40B45NJK/details/) in Slack for real-time feedback from observers.
2. Add the [research questions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/Research/2022-09-profile-editing-evaluation/research-plan.md#research-questions) to the session thread, and remind observers you’ll be asking them to post their top 3 insights from the session in the slack thread.
3. Send out the [observer instructions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Observer-guidelines.1622311177.html) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into #[feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel)).
4. Mute your Slack notifications.

### Starting the session

- In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute.
- Keep observers in the waiting room
- In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked
- Check your screensharing setup and share permissions for participants.
- When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*

## Intro – 5/8 (AT) minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Pam and [TBD] is taking notes. There are members from the website team who would like to hear your feedback firsthand during our session. Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I want to be sure before we get going. Are you okay with observers joining this session?

- *If participant does not consent, use Slack to ask the observers to leave the Zoom.*
- *If participant consents, admit observers.*
- *Introduce notetaker and observers turn on cameras to introduce them.*
- *Ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras and mics for remainder of the session to save bandwidth.*

Today we're going to take a look at the VA.gov website and ask you some questions. We’re interested in learning from you what it’s like to navigate and find information on the website.


---

**[AT sessions]** As part of signing up for the session, we asked if you need a screen reader to use the internet. According to my notes, you normally use [whatever participant has said]. Can you tell me more about how you use that?
- Are you able to use that during our session today?
- That sounds good, thank you.

**[Magnification sessions]** As part of signing up for the session, we asked if you need magnification to use the internet. Can you tell me more about how you use that?
- Are you able to use magnification during our session today?
- That sounds good, thank you.

There are a few things additional things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 60/90 for AT minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. To help us learn from your experience, please share out loud all of your thoughts and feelings.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

_Start recording._

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
- **I’m also going to make sure transcriptions are turned on to improve our notes.**

_Turn on transcription._
