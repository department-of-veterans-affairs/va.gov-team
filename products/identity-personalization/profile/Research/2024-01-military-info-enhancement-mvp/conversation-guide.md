## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Pam and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes.

Today we're going to talk about the kinds of jobs you did while you were serving/enlisted. Are you familiar with the phrase “military occupational speciality” or MOS? 

`If yes` Great, just wanted to be sure! 

`If no` No problem, that just means a code that identifies a specific job.

We’re going to specifically focus on that today.  

I’d like to learn about how you understand and use your military history – especially your occupational history, and ways in which you have had to share your military history in order to receive benefits or for other reasons.

- I have some questions to ask you first to better understand your experience. 
- Next I’d like to take a closer look with you at your own military information. 
- Last, I have some ideas I’d like to get your feedback on.

Before we start, I have a few things that I need to go over with you:

- **This entire session should take 1 hour or less.** To make sure I cover everything, I may  prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.**  If there is a question you’d rather skip, just let me know, and I can move onto the next question. If you would like to stop the session for any reason, just tell me you need to go. You’ll still be compensated for your time.
- I know Perigean already asked if it was alright with you to allow observers in this interview. I wanted to confirm that: **Are you still okay with a few additional observers during this session?**
   - If no: Use Slack to let observers know they won’t be admitted.
   - If yes: Admit observers.
   - Notetaker, observers: please give a brief, camera-on introduction to yourself and what you do at VA.gov
      - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to ensure we’ve captured your feedback accurately. 

	If yes: **Would you also be comfortable if we wound up using a short video clip of our session to help my internal colleagues learn from your experience?** In these clips, we edit or blur out any information about participants, like your on-screen image. No feedback is attributed to participants by name. After analysis is complete, all session recordings are destroyed.

	If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to ask for your confirmation again that you are okay with me recording this session and potentially sharing video clips with internal colleagues.**

`Start recording.`

- **I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?**
- **Would you be comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?**

Thank you! I’ll also ask you again about the short video clips at the end of your session, because you can still change your mind about me using them.

## Interview questions - 15 minutes

I’d like to start with a few questions.

1. What branch did you serve in?
2. How long did you serve?
3. Did you separate or retire?
4. What was your last military occupational specialty before you left from the military? In a few sentences, can you describe some of the responsibilities and tasks associated with that role?
5. Can you walk me through your career progression over time? How did you transition between different occupational specialties, and what motivated those transitions?
6. Did you ever have more than one occupational specialty at a time?
7. What are some examples when you had to share your MOS data 
8. Have you ever had to share any part of your military occupational history in order to receive benefits?
	- Where/how did you get all your data? How did you share it with the VA?
9. Have you had to share any part of your military occupational history for any other reasons? If so, what for?

Thanks for sharing your experience and history with me! Before we go to the next part, do you recall giving permission to gather your military history ahead of time as part of this research session?

`If permission yes`
Great. We’re going to use this information and do a mapping activity together.

`If permission no`
Thanks for letting me know. I’d like to shift to showing you an approach to presenting military job history information . We’re in very early stages and hope to get input that will shape how we 

## Mapping activity - 15 minutes

`If Mural`

I have your information in a virtual whiteboard called Mural. What I’d like to do is organize it together, with you telling me how you would group things. This will help me understand ways in which people organize their history in a way that makes sense to them.

Do you have any questions before we start? 

### Missing items (5 minutes)
Here are the items. Let’s go through them – is there any information that seems missing that is meaningful to you?

### Grouping items (5 minutes)
Next, let’s group similar items together – how would you group things together in a way that makes sense to you? 

> [!tip] 
> Look for:
> - Chronological order
> - Grouping types
> - What’s missing

### Ranking items (5 minutes)

- Next, let’s rank these groups by importance. What should go first? Second? etc.

Is there anything else you’d like to share with me before we move to the last part of our session?

Thanks so much for doing that mapping activity with me! It will really help me understand how people think about and use their military history.

## Mock-up evaluation – 15 minutes

For our last portion of the session, I’d like to share with you some designs. It has fake information in it right now, but this is an initial idea of one way to group a veteran’s military occupational specialties. I’d like to go through it with you and get your sense of what makes sense or what does not make sense to you.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In Mural, show the wireframe
> - Include stickies with questions (gradually unhide them)
> - Add stickies underneath with participant comments

- What’s the first thing that comes to mind when you look at this?
- How does this compare to the ordering we did just before this? 
- How would you use this information if it was on VA.gov?
	- How would you expect to be able to use it? `e.g., copy and paste it somewhere else`
	- `If needed:` How would this help you in applying for a new benefit or submitting a claim?
- How would this make that difficult? (i.e. is anything missing)
	- What about locations? How useful would their inclusion be? What would it be useful for?
- How useful is it to you to include the start date of each occupation specialty? What about end dates?
- What do you expect would happen if you clicked on this `show more` text?
	- Would you want to show more up front, or less, and have more information show up after you click `show more`? Why?
	- How would you feel if clicking on `show more` would take you to a different page?
- How would you expect job history to be treated if you have periods of active and inactive duty?
- What would you do if something in here seemed incomplete or inaccurate? 

## Post-Task Interview - 3 minutes

- Is there anything else you'd like to mention about what we've covered today?
- Do you have any questions for me?

## Consent to use video clips – 1 minute

- I want to return to the question I asked you at the beginning. After everything we’ve talked today, are you still comfortable with me possibly sharing a video clip of this session with my VA colleagues? As a reminder, I will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA colleagues with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
   - `If yes:` Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?

## Thank-You and Closing - 1 minute

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
