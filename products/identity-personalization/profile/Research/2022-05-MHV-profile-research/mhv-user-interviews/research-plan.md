# Research Plan for MHV personal information, Veteran interviews, March 2022
## Background
MyHealtheVet (MHV) has its own profile, which is part of a larger Personal Information section. In support of the health apartment transition, we need to understand how Veterans currently use this part of MHV in order to inform our approach to aligning the MHV profile with the VA.gov profile.

### OCTO Objectives 
This research supports these OCTO objectives:
1. Logged-in users can update their personal information easily and instantly.
2. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information.

## Research Goals	
Through this research, we’d like to understand:
1. How MHV users use the personal information sections, especially certain fields in My Profile and the My Links section.
2. Where MHV users expect to find health-related profile information.

### Outcome
We’ll use our findings to inform our strategy for moving forward with rolling the MHV profile into the VA.gov profile.  

### Research questions
1. What level of familiarity do MHV users have with the personal information section?
2. How do MHV users update their personal information, if not through the MHV profile?
3. How useful are the personal information sections to MHV users? Specifically, we want to know how Veterans use:
- the “My VA Treating Facility fields”
- the “My relationship with the VA field”
- the Health information card
- the My links feature
- the In Case of emergency feature
3. What information from the personal information section is important for a MHV user to be able to edit?
4. How might the current VA.gov profile meet MHV user needs?
5. Where do MHV users expect to find health-related preference and personal information, such as blood type and treating facilites?

### Hypothesis
1. Since MHV users completed registration only one time (if at all), and their data was then matched with MPI, they won’t have a lot of familiarity with the personal information section.
2. Since MHV users have been taught that their MHV profile data doesn’t go through the whole VA system, MHV users update their personal information at a clinic or over the phone.
3. Since analytics show low page visits compared with the rest of MHV pages, the pages in the personal information section are not useful to MHV users.
4. Since there is little context around the “My VA treating facility” fields, Veterans will be confused and unclear about this feature.
5. In previous studies, we’ve heard that Veterans expect the VA to know certain things about them. We hypothesize the “My relationship with the VA” field will not be useful to Veterans. They will expect the VA to know that about them without them having to check a box.
6. MHV users will prioritize being able to edit contact information and prescriptions since those are the things about that with the most potential to change.
7. Since MHV users are used to seeing personal health-related information and preferences within the context of their healthcare, they’ll expect to find this in the health apartment rather than in their profile.
8. Previous research has shown that the VA.gov profile meets Veteran expectations, so we expect that it will mostly meet the needs of MHV users. The exception will be the absence of MHV notification settings.

## Method	
We’ll conduct semi-structured interview, and a moderated hybrid card sort using OptimalWorkshop.

### Location
Remote via zoom.
