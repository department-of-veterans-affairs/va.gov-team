# My HealtheVet Personal Information Interviews - Conversation Guide
## Guide for note taking
Thank you note takers! Here's a breakdown of what we're hoping to highlight in this study, in terms of Veteran feedback:

- Which sections of My HealtheVet personal information are most useful to users, if any?
- How do My HealtheVet users use the fields `My VA Treating facilities` and `My relationship with VA`?
- How do My HealtheVet users use the health information card? 
- How do My HealtheVet users use the My Links section? 
- Where do My HealtheVet users expect to find health-related profile information? (Card sort)

If we have time, we’ll ask users for feedback on the VA.gov profile, and hope to highlight:
- How does the current profile meet the needs of My HealtheVet users?

## Intro - 3 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Liz, and I also have a note taker with me. Today we’re going to talk about My HealtheVet, specifically - the personal information section. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- There are a couple of members from the website team who would like to observe the session and hear your feedback live. Are you comfortable with them joining the session? No pressure either way.
- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear about your experience, and your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **During this session, we are going to look at My HealtheVet and then do a sorting activity. You will need log into My HealtheVet and share your screen. This means we’ll see some personal information** Are you comfortable sharing your screen?
	- If no, moderator can log into a test account on My HealtheVet in staging and share their screen for participant review and commentary.

- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Warm-up Questions - 4 minutes
1. I know you have a My HealtheVet account. Tell me how you use the personal information section of the site. 
	- *If needed:* This is where you’d find your profile, health information card, in case of emergency contacts, etc.
2. If you had to update personal information with VA, how would you go about doing that?

## Task 1: Review My HealtheVet Personal Info IA - 6 minutes
**Task description:**
- Now I’d like to take a look at My HealtheVet with you and get your thoughts on the personal information section of the site.  Can you go ahead and login, and then share your screen once you are logged in?
- If participant cannot log in, moderator can log in on staging and share their screen to facilitate the conversation.
	- Navigate to a browser on your VA virtual machine
	- Go to MHV staging: https://mhv-syst.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/home
	- Use the second set of credentials on this list.

**Begin:**

1. Thank you! Let’s go to the personal information section of the site. (OK to guide navigation if needed)
2. Take a look at the sections listed under personal information - before clicking on anything, I’d like to know how you’ve used any of these sections before.

**Things to look out for:**
- Which sections is the participant already familiar with?

## Task 2: Review My Profile - 10 minutes
- Let’s take a look at the profile page - can you click on that link please?
- Tell me about how you use this page.
- Why are some of the boxes greyed out? 
	- What are your thoughts on why they are greyed out? 
- Which of these fields are important for you to be able to change?
- What are you surprised to see here? Why?
- Which fields do you have questions about?

Now there are a couple of specific questions I have on this page.
- Let’s review the What is your current relationship with VA field.  I see there are some selections there. How did those get there?
- How does this help you to be able to update this?
- Now talk to me about the “My VA Treating facilities” option. What is that for?
- How did those boxes get checked?
- How does it help you to be able to update this?
	- If applicable for participant:
		- According to my notes, you’ve been to 2 different VA facilities in different states. Can you tell me a bit about what the experience has been like, going between the two?
		- What has been challenging about managing health care across two different VA facilities?
- And lastly, if you moved, where would you go to update your address for prescriptions?

**Things to look out for:**
- Which fields are most important for the participant to change?
- Is there anything that confused or surprised the participant?
- Does the participant understand some of their profile is automatically filled out and not editable?
- What is useful about the My Relationship with VA field?
- What is the participants understanding of My VA Treating facilities?

- Tell me about how you use this page.
- Have you ever used this card?
- How might it be useful to you?

### My Links
- Now lets go to the my links page (OK to guide navigation)
- Tell me about how you use this page.
- Have you ever used this feature?
- How might it be useful to you?
- Who else can see your links?


**Things to look out for:**
- Has the participant ever used any of these sections?
- How might they be useful to the participant?
- Does the participant expect that VA has access to their links and emergency contacts?


## Task 4: Card sort - 10 minutes
- Next we’re going to do a sorting activity on a different website. Let me send you the link.
- [Card sort link](https://p3y41d84.optimalworkshop.com/optimalsort/k3774wsz)
* This is a tool that helps us understand how Veterans would group certain items. If we can understand how items are grouped, we can then organize them in an expected way. It is kind of like this, imagine you own a grocery store and you have a truck delivering a shipment of new products and you need to figure out the best place for everything in the store so that shoppers can easily find it. You might consider putting the cheddar cheese with other dairy products and a broom near the cleaning supplies.

**Instructions to open the card sort:**
	* Go to the chat in zoom. It is located at the bottom of this zoom window and looks like a speech bubble.
	* Click on the link for the optimal workshop card sort.
	
* On the left, we have various cards with information you might recognize from the My HealtheVet pages we just reviewed. 
* On the right you can drag items and group them together. Try to think of these groups as broader categories rather than specific to the website we just looked at.
* If you do not recognize what something is on one of the cards, or need me to explain it a bit more, let me know.
* I started three groups for you, including one to place cards that don’t matter to you.
	* If there is a card that doesn’t fit into any of the groups I made, you can create and name your own group. Let’s practice that.
* Take the top card that says “Practice” and drop it into a column.
* Now take it and drop it into the white space. This will create a new group - you can type a name in at the type. Call it anything you want.
* Now you can go ahead and delete the group by clicking the red X in the upper right corner.
* Any questions?

* Organize cards in a way that makes sense to you
	* We will start at the top left and work our way through the cards, while we are moving them, help me out by “thinking out loud” so that I can understand why you might want to group things together.

* If participant created groups:
	* Talk to me about the group you made. What does it mean to you?


- I wanted to ask you about something else. It’s not in here, but are you familiar with the 1095B tax form? Where would you group that, if it was on a card?

- When complete: Please go ahead and click the finish button so we can save these groupings. It’ll be anonymous. 

**Moderator notes:**

- We are not concerned with prioritizing cards within the grouping.
- What might the participant expect or suggest, based on their communications experience with other web pages/services?

## Post-Task Interview - 3 minutes

- Based on your experience today, is there anything you would like to comment on that we haven't discussed?
- Any questions for me? 

## Thank-You and Closing - 1 minute
We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    **If Yes:** Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
