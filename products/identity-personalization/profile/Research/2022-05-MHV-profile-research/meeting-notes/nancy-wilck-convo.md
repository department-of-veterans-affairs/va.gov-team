# Interview with Nancy Wilck
3/5/2022

## Background info
- Title: Director of Connected Health Implementation (was formerly acting head of  [Office of Connected Care](https://connectedcare.va.gov/) , but I don’t think she is acting anymore)
- Office of Connected Care is under VHA, and they have medical expertise. They focus on patient engagement, on using technology to improve health outcomes. 
- The mobile apps at  [mobile.va.gov](http://mobile.va.gov/) will give you an idea of ways OCC try to engage with Veterans.
- Nancy works with Theresa
- works mainly on mobile.va.gov apps

## Intro
Can you tell me a little bit about your role and involvement with MHV?
- not the mhv expert; doesn’t do a ton with MHV
- director of connected health implementation
	- implementation of any kind of virtual care product
- Her folks in the field help with getting people registered on MHV
	- MHV has it’s own field workforce; her team is a supplement to that
- Her boss, Kathy Friske, retired:
	- Nancy is currently acting in Kathy’s former role
	- Most of her time now is handling Kathy’s responsibilities

## MHV profile transition
1. What expectations do you have around the MHV to VA.gov profile transition?
	- If we’re going to have a patient profile, or a Veteran profile for VA.gov writ large, **it seems like we wouldn’t have a separate profile under health.**
	- If I were a patient, like the health stuff, I would expect all the health stuff to be in my medical record.
	- I would not expect all of that [content in MHV Personal Info] to live in a profile on Va.gov. I would be thinking in terms of taking all of those data elements and thinking where should they live and be pulled from, if the patient does have a need to have the information.

- **Health Information**
	- I can see that there’s potentially value in a wallet card, esp. for older Vets (or medication list). But to me that information should be another type of report that you can pull through Blue Button type of feature, or download my data, and do it in a wallet size format, because I just think that’s the authoritative medical record
	- I do think things like blood type - that’s interesting that’s in there because I never hear anyone talk about blood types anymore. I think it’s one of those things where if you’re unconscious they’ll test your blood type
	- Should be pulled from data, not self entry
- **In Case of Emergency**
	- I had no idea all of this was under personal information. I would be very interested in knowing how it’s used and what the perceived value is for veterans. 
	- Is it more for their use or do they expect for someone else to see it in an emergency situation?
- **My Links**
	- MHV went live 18 years ago. It was before the time when personal health records or patient portals were ubiquitous and the idea was that it could be used by Veterans or anyone. I bet you a lot of that information that we just looked at in the profile, was an artifact of that day and time, when people were keeping their own records because no one else did it.
	- My Links could be a way to stitch together disparate health sources
	- How many Veterans are using an app to do something like that rather than log on to multiple portals?
	- I do think there would be - if people would do the work - everybody acknowledges the gaps and problems that are called when people see multiple providers and they don’t talk to each other. **The question is are Veterans interested in doing that for themselves?** Having a place like VA.gov where I want to be able to connect to these 3-4 other portals where I’ve received care. Or do they prefer to download the PDF and manage it themselves?
	- What are patient expectations around their ability to consolidate their records though a tool VA provides. Is that something they’d find valuable? If so, where would they expect to find it?
	- Personally, I do see that as very separate as My Profile. 

2. What else should we consider as we think about how the VA.gov profile may need to support MHV users?
	- I guess the first thing I would do is I would ask MHV if they can pull data about the usage of those various parts of the profile and patient information, and look to see what’s being used.  They can tell you the last time it was accessed. I would look at that to prepare myself for interviews with Veterans:
		- How useful is this?
		- Where would you expect to find it?
3. Who else should we be sure to talk to?
	- Theresa and Carnetta
	- Susan Hidary -  She’s the liaison to all the MHV coordinators in the field?
	- Is there value talking to some of their high performing MHV coordinators in terms of what they perceive Veterans value the most or they want the most?
