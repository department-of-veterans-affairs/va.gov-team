# MHV research next steps
## Topics to discuss
1. The actual work that needs to be done
	- what already exists
	- what doesn’t move over
2. What we think our work is versus 
3. What MHV needs to do and how they might need to be involved
4. How do we talk to MHV about this and fit into a road map?

## Work that needs to be done
### Migrate notification preferences from MHV profile
- VA.gov needs to
	- work with VA profile and VA notify to get these preferences
	- VA Notify set up new preferences
	- VA profile inherit existing preferences

- MHV needs to
	- Migrate existing preferences to the VA profile backed
	- Confirm that the MHV newsletter is moving over
	- Be involved in a conversation about when and how to direct people to VA.gov profile instead of MHV

### Migrate secure messaging (SM) preference from MHV SM setting
- Need to sync with VA notify
- Prefer to prioritize this over other notifications, health apt team is building this

### Health-related preferences
#### Health apt team thoughts about these items:
	- Blood type - agree that it shouldn’t be in VA.gov profile
		- Not something that’s been in any of the design concepts
		- Something to consider with medical record
	- Organ donor - since VA doesn’t use this information, agree w/ recommendation
	- Don’t move over fields that are self-journaled
		- Facilities
		- Don’t move over the printable health information card
		- Emergency contact
#### Health apt team questions 
- Still curious if Veterans need to see a list of current facilities vs a list of all facilities they’ve ever been to, particularly with appointments
- Wants more info about the card sort

### Rx shipping addresses
- This work will be ongoing
- Samara is leading this
- It affects the profile insofar as it could confuse people to have an address in their profile that does not impact their Rx shipping address

## Communicating to MHV
- They work in 8 week increments; next increment starts July 6
	- Would be helpful to things figured out by July 6 for actual development work
	- SMEs can be pulled in anytime
- Samara will draft up a plan at mapping out what the work might look like so we can talk about that.
	- When we talk to MHV folks stress that these are things we can start on their timeline
	- Need to stress that this involves many teams
		- We’ll need to do an intake with VA Profile / VA Notify
			- VA Profile does a 9-12 increment
	- Need to prioritize Secure Messaging 
- Liz will prepare a deck of recommendations and migration plans
- We don’t need to discuss today how to retire it, but outline it as a next step in the presentation

## Who to include
- Carnetta
- Theresa
- Possibly Patti (Patricia Henry, SM product lead)
