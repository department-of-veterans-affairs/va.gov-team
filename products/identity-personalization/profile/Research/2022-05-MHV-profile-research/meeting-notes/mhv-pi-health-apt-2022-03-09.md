# 2022-03-09 MHV Personal Info - Health Apt Sync

## Attendees
- Liz Lantz
- Meg Peters
- Samara Strauss
- Marci McGuire

## Notes
- Some of what they are working on in Health Apartment is actually under personal information on MHV
- Want to be sure we are all on the same page
- Health records is one of the "big four" tasks, but it has been put under Personal Information and Download My Data in MHV
- Pay or Receive Funds is also under Personal Information
- Unclear why there is currently no records section in MHV
- Appointments are under Get Care
- Heath Apartment has a [prototype for Health Apartment](https://www.sketch.com/s/908b453b-ef8b-4193-b955-ea00f9fd14aa/a/7yK3287/play) that they are starting to test today.
- All the stuff under Personal Info in MHV is under Health Records in the new prototype, plus other info like 
  - Labs & tests
  - Health Summary
  - Medical images & reports
  - Add and track health information
  - Manage your electronic record sharing options.  
  - Some of the things that are not called out in MHV will be called out in HA.
- Copay bills and travel pay has everything related to money
- Blue Button is the  most comprehensive way to get all your information in a report
  - VA Health Summary has some overlap with Blue Button
- We will review their testing results once complete
- There is some info that fits into My VA vs. Profile

- Some things we'd like to know plans about:
  - In Case of Emergency 
    - Liz's understanding is that this is reviewed by staff when patients check in.  This will go into MPI in Sept so there will be one source of truth.
    - Has Health Apartment considered using this?
      - They haven't thought about it much yet
      - Meg thinks this may fall under Facilities as "health preferences"
    - Some things seem to fit the profile; some is ambiguous
    - Samara: Ming in the past had asked about adding Next of Kin and other info to the Profile.  She would hypothesize that the Emergency Contact info would go under Profile, but needs to be validated in user testing.  Falls under "things the VA knows about me" - used for health-related info, but not exclusively related to health care or the VA.  Things that the VA has no control over; it's the Veteran's info.
    - Could a Veteran who doesn't receive Health Care need a Emergency Contact? (e.g. - someone who calls the Crisis Line or a homeless Veteran) - may not be only about health.
    - Profile would never house dependents, but that doesn't mean we wouldn't display them and then link over to the Dependents tool.
    - Is there room in the Profile for family related info?  Probably yes.
  - Health Information Card
    - Maybe it's a "health preference"
    - Meg also is unsure where it belongs.
    - Currently under VA health care benefits because it's like their ID card.  
      - There are three types of Veteran ID cards, and it's a mess.  
    - This one is a question mark -- it's very much health-related, so it doesn't really make sense to be managed by the Profile team.  
    - Whether we show it in the profile or link to it is another conversation.  This should probably be explored more.
    - We have questions about how people are using this. 
    - There is also a place to edit the address on the Health Information card, which IS kind of profile related.
    - The card is painted as being required to go to health appointments, but Veterans kind of disagree with that.
  - My Links
    - What do they  know about it, what plans does Health Apartment have?  Nothing. 
    - They don't know if people use it.  Google Analytics would show if it's being used
    - Profile is info that is pulled from a system, not journaling.  
- We don't know how much MVH knows about the HA approach
- Liz's approach will be to learn from MHV
- Liz created a report for the discovery she did - will post link in Slack
