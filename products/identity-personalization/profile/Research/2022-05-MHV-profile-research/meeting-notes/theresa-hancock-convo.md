# Interview with Theresa Hancock
3/11/2022

## Intro
Can you tell me a little bit about your role and involvement with MHV?
	- oversee strategic planning for patient portal and personal health record (which is MHV)
	- I’m in charge of program mgmt office: 
		- communications 
		- marketing and outreach
		- statisics
		- content management
		- requirements management
		- training and education
		- strategic planning
		- implementation
	- 4 parts of our secret sauce of success:
		- having a dedicated PMO 
		- having a dedicated OINT (office of info tech. Developers, business analyst, UCD team, and a help desk) team, 
		- having dedicated MHV coordinators in the field
		- having a dedicated MHV help desk.
		- those are the 4 things that make the patient portal and personal health record successful
When you say “patient portal” is that MHV?
		- MHV is a patient portal but it’s unique because it has a personal health record, and it has PGHD (patient generated health data)

## MHV profile transition
1. What expectations do you have around the MHV to VA.gov profile transition?
	- My expectation is that I always like to look at the end result first: that veterans can go into va.gov and no matter where they have information, data services, it’s served up to them in a digestible view.
	- How it happens behind the scenes is irrelevant to the patient; those are things we at VA need to work through.
	- End goals:
		- all data is behind the scenes
		- Patients find value in what we’re providing and want to come back
	- That’s going to take time
		- it needs to happen incrementally
		- we need to be careful - it’s not as easy as saying “we’re going to take this piece out of MHV and put it on VA.gov”. 
		- If you do that you’re going to end up with leftovers and it’s not going be the same experience and the satisfaction scores (Foresee data) are going to go down
		- We need to always keep the patient experience at the forefront
		- The same issue with jumping back and forth between mhv and va.gov. it needs to be seamless. We’re having this problem with cerner. 
			- The patient has to go between two different portals
			- same thing applies with converging with
	- We have to figure out how not to be disruptive. 
	- When we talk about VA.gov profile - I don’t think we should be storing in two places. 
		- When the Veteran makes a change, it needs to be centralized and controlled in one place
		- You defeat the purpose of having data in two places
	- Data is stored and maintained and controlled in once place. Without being disruptive to the veteran as much as possible.
		- That means if a veteran has to go to MHV and they have to enter the data, and they’re bounced back and forth, that’s a problem
		- I don’t like to be prescriptive in solutions, but back to the end state - the Veteran shouldn’t even know it’s happening.
**What is the “one place” you’re thinking of?** 
	- VEO is going to use VA Profile. Wherever that is, if it’s MPI, or whatever. 
	- The experts need to figure out what can be done and what should be done.

2. What do you know about how “My VA Treating Facilities” info is used?
	- My understanding is that is what correlate to a patient on any facility 
	- We use that to be able to isolate a patient against a patient. That’s how we can send dedicated messages to a specific facility, like for Cerner going live.
	- We can use their facility number to say “I only want to do things with this facility”	 
	- Veterans don’t change that. The facilities change it
**Reviewed screenshots**
	- Theresa doesn’t think Veterans make changes in their profile, but if they do, she doesn’t think it impacts secure messaging or functionality in MHV. 
	- The functionality tied to facilities in MHV is using some other facility data, not what is in profile
	- 
3. I’d like to talk about the question “What is your relationship to VA?”. I understand that’s an important field for MHV. Can you talk to me about that?
	- Statistics and data - funding and to support services they provide
	- Is there a way to correlate a person is a MHV user and a VA patient?
**Do we need to bring this over to VA.gov front end so a Veteran can self-select these things?**
	- We need to double check all the purposes of all these boxes? To match whether they’re someplace else or not. 
	- Carnetta will know how all of these are used.
	
4. What are your plans around the notification section of My Profile?
	- My expectation is that VA Notify will pick up notifications for MHV core capabilities. All notifications will come from that place, except the newsletter.
		- With the exception of the newsletter. She saw on the prototype VA.gov has “to subscribe to the newsletter” it’s at the very bottom of the screen.
			- not in favor. We have found we have over 1.2 million self subscriber, with a lot of digital engagement.
			- Think it’s important enough that it needs to be strategically placed 
		- Plans for the newsletter post-convergence are TBD. Haven’t talked about it yet. 
5. What else should we consider as we think about how the VA.gov profile may need to support MHV users?
	- I think the most important thing is you have one piece of the pie in this convergence. There’s also VA Notify, there’s also conversion of Rx refill, are our core capabilities
	- It’s the piece mealing. Strategically we need to plan out how this is going to work, not just pick up pieces that someone is going to work on.
	- It’s not dismantling. We need to think through how we’re going to strategically 
	
## Next steps
We’ve talked to Nancy, Carnetta, and will be speaking to Susan Haidary later today. Anyone else we should talk to?
	- Tricia Henry - VCHIO. She is her implementation and secure messaging manager.
	- If you talk to her, you’ll have spoken to all my product owners that you need to.
