# Interview with Susan Haidary
3/11/22
Liz Lantz, Susan Haidary, Marci McGuire, Samara Strauss

## Intro
- Can you tell me a little bit about your role and involvement with MHV?
	- Been with MHV since 2003, started as a coordinator 
	- Doesn’t do technical things with MHV
	- Works with coordinator all the time

## Summary
- MHV coordinators don’t use the personal information section of MHV themselves.
-  They educate Veterans that it exists, and may guide Veterans there. 
- They’d most commonly direct a Veteran to the My Account section if a Veteran suspects someone other than themselves has logged into their account. 
- If MHV coordinators need to see information about a Veteran for some reason, they’ll use the admin portal which pulls from MPI (not MHV).

## MHV personal information
- Meeting started with a demo of MHV; logged in with a premium test account

1. What do you know about how coordinators use the personal information section of MHV?
	- MHV coordinators don’t do anything with this themselves. 
	- They mostly educate people that this exists, and guide them there when needed
	
- **My Account** 
	- When a Veteran has a security concern, is most commonly when they’re directed to personal information, to update their password or look at the activity log
		- This is not infrequent - people frequently share passwords, especially when there is a custody case.
		- Advised to contact help desk, and change their password and security questions
	- **My Profile**
		- It’s not common that a coordinator would help a Veteran fill out their profile
		- The Veteran’s fingers need to be on the keyboard, the coordinator can’t enter or change information here.
		- Coordinators are more involved at the registration point and much after that	.
		- This section has a learning curve for coordinators
			- We have to train coordinators that anything they change in MHV  profile with contact information will go nowhere.
			- If an email is changed in MHV, and it’s not changed in the secure messaging portal, it doesn’t get updated.
			- They’re referred to the VA.gov profile page to update contact info.
			- They’d use the admin portal which pulls from MPI and not what’s updated in My Profile
	- **In Case of Emergency**
		- Nobody sees this on the coordinator side
		- This data is only accessible to the MHV user.
		- They have next of kin and ICE in another database
	- **My Links**
		- Susan doesn’t know what this is
	- **Health Information**
		- This is interesting. You can print it out into a little folded card. 
		- This does pull from the MHV profile in some ways 
		- MHV ID at the top card means nothing to the Veteran
		- The card would be very useful from a coordinator perspective, if it had medications. 
			- I used this with patients back in the day.
			- We’ve met repeatedly about modifying it
			- We tell people to print out the card, and handwrite medications on the back of it.
			
2. Which sections of Personal Information are critical for Veterans?
	- Change password, for security reasons
	
3. Is there value talking to some high performing MHV coordinators in terms of what they perceive Veterans value the most, or they want the most?
	- Medications on the health information card
	- A connection between the contact information in MHV and VA.gov

4. What is the difference between VISN and Facility coordinators?
	- Each VISN has facility coordinators at each facility
	- VISN coordinators oversee the a group of facilities
