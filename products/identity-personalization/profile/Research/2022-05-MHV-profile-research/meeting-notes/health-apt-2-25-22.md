# MHV <> VA.gov Profile transition: Health apartment team update
2/25/22

Liz Lantz, Meg Peters

**What work has the health apt team already done on evaluating the MHV <> VA.gov profiles?**
- Starting mapping MHV profile to VA.gov profile [in a mural board](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1605714305034/bf4b29c95042d0e6e4cef37313e485f6148a0bcb?sender=megpeters0505), but that was before health apartment team spun up. Didn’t get very far and that was a long time ago. 

**Are there other things we should be considering as we think about how the VA.gov profile might change as it needs to support MHV users?**

 1. It’s unclear which of these would go in profile vs Health apt.
	- Health caregivers (FYI on non-health roles: delegate, fiduciary, person with power of attorney)
	- Health Information Card (VHIC)
	- My VA treating facilities (user can select)
	- My providers and doctors (self-entered)
	- My non-VA health insurance (self-entered)
	- MHV newsletter subscription
  
2. We should learn more about the facilites checkbox from the MHV user perspective; in our June 2021 study, Veterans may have been biased by being asked about it while looking at VA.gov and knowing it was on MHV.  
  - During UAT for debts, for medical co-pays (Riley and Becca). For one participant, the one Meg watched, a list of 10 facilities came up in this experience, and the user was baffled that they were still registered at those facilities 
  - Riley might have some insight into this.
  - There’s a place in MHV where people can enter facilities, other than in the profile. We couldn’t locate it in this meeting.
  
3. Need to be aware of the pharmacy UX, there’s some discrepancy with addresses because they don’t all pull from MPI
4. Be aware that things are going to change because we won’t have MHV account levels anymore
5. **Questions for MHV users**: Meg thinks that MHV address is not the source of truth - so an address could be wrong in MHV and prescriptions are going to the wrong place. Have people had problems with this?

**Out of scope for this research, but questions she has**
- There’s some business process that we’re not familiar with yet where a dr asks if a person wants to do their Rx by mail, and they put it in MHV. And if you say no you want to pick up in person, those Rxs go to the in person pharmacy and not in MHV pharmacy, but you can see them in your MHV health record and probably in blue button.
- We’re going to have to decide, just because you’re signed in, can you self enter health data or do you have to have health care
- This idea of tracking your health and wearable devices (PGHD, patient generated health data). We have to take that into account for health apartment. How do you put your data into the website and decide to share it with your doctor? Bringing this up because it’s “my stuff” but it’s “my health stuff”
- There’s a connected app section in Profile
