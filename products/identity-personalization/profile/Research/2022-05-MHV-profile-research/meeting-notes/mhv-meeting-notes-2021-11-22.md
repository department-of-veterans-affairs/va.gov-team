# My HealtheVet and VA Profile Alignment Discussion 11-22-2021

# Notes
- Arienne - they are trying to understand about transitioning to one profile on VA.gov
- They are having a hard time understanding what we do in the interim
- Are we providing deep links to the VA.gov profile
- Is it easier for the Veteran to update their profile on MHV?
- Samara
  - In terms of alignment between the two profiles eventually becoming one profile,  she doesn't really have any additional info than they do
  - There are members of their team working on the MHV/profile merge, but nobody has come to her about any specific features that need to be added
- Deep links to the Profile are probably not the best idea until the merge is complete
- Do we have any ideas or anything? 
- Samara
  - Probably depends on what the information is
  - She's kind of with MHV - she doesn't want to deep link anything until there is some kind of rollover strategy.
  - That might start to make sense once the health team moves some stuff over from myHealtheVet to VA.gov; otherwise is seems strange to ask health users to modify their info on VA.gov when they otherwise manage everything on MHV
  - They want to SHOW them their info on MHV, but go to VA.gov to update
  - Veteran testing shows they hate the idea of a deep link and going back and forth.  They would understand if it was all on VA.gov
  - VA Profile (backend) connects to a bunch of other databases.  VA.gov also connects to VA Profile, so we are not the central point of contact.
- Consensus - it probably doesn't make sense to have Vets doing this until all of the fields are available on VA.gov
- Should they also consider getting rid of fax and page numbers since we are? 
  - Samara - we would also have to get VA Profile to do that.  That something that Samara has no control over.  She checks in on that once a month.
- Lexi - a some point, she was asked to bring the VA.gov notifications into MyHealtheVet.  She's thinking that's a bad idea.  With the VetText they were also told not to include that with MHV notifications. Do you have any information on your notification section?
- Samara - I would say don't even try.  No because it's hard, but because you'd be duplicating so much work.  The page is simple; it has three notifications now and there will eventually be two more.   VA Profile backend provides the data that is shown on the front end. It would be a lot of work for them for little payout.
