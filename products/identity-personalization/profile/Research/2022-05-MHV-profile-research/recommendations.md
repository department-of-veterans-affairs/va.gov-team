## Background
In order to support Veterans in the Starting Up and Taking Care of Myself phases of the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf), we need to define a strategy for how to move forward with rolling the My HealtheVet (MHV) profile into the VA.gov profile. 

In order to do this, we wanted to better understand:
1. The similarities and differences between the My HealtheVet and VA.gov profiles.
2. The current status of MHV profile work and transition planning.
3. How MHV support roles (coordinators and help desk) use the MHV profile.
4. How MHV users use the profile.

We completed the following activities to inform our strategy:
- Profile evaluation and comparison ([findings report](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/mhv-profile-research/comparison/findings.md))
- Interviewed MHV product owners, MHV help desk directors, and a MHV coordinator lead ([interview summary report](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/mhv-profile-research/stakeholder-interviews.md))
- Interviewed MHV users and asked them to complete a moderated card sort. ([topline summary](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/mhv-profile-research/mhv-user-interviews/topline-summary.md))

Read details about [the questions we sought to answer](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/mhv-profile-research/README.md#research-questions) in our project outline.

## Recommendations
The following recommendations are focused on 4 sections of the My HealtheVet personal information section:
1. My Profile
2. In case of emergency
3. Health information card
4. My links

The remaining sections are being migrated by the health modernization team; we focused our research on profile and other sections our teams had questions about.

### 1. Maintain important items that are already consistent between the two profiles.

The following data points exist in both the MHV and VA.gov profiles.  These are important data points, and common to online profiles. We recommend keeping these in the VA.gov profile. 

Some are editable on MHV (indicated below) and will no longer be editable on VA.gov
| Field | Editable on MHV? | Note |
|----|----|----|
| First name | no | Read only; comes from Master Person Index (MPI) |
| Middle name | yes | Read only; comes from MPI |
| Last name | no | Read only; comes from MPI. |
| Suffix | yes | Read only; comes from MPI |
| Alias | yes | called “Preferred name” on VA.gov |
| Birth date | no | VA.gov profile currently matches functionality on MHV  |
| Military branches | yes | Read only; comes from MPI |
| How would you like to be addressed? | yes | Read only; comes from MPI |
| Email address | yes | VA.gov profile currently matches functionality on MHV    |
| Home phone | yes | VA.gov profile currently matches functionality on MHV   |
| Mobile phone | yes | VA.gov profile currently matches functionality on MHV   |
| Work phone | yes | VA.gov profile currently matches functionality on MHV   |

### 2. Retire certain items with MHV.
After speaking to stakeholders and MHV users, we recommend retiring items in MHV that:
- are masked, such as social security number.
- we’ve already retired on VA.gov, such as gender.
- are duplicative of features we already know work well on VA.gov, such as “How would you like to be addressed”
- had low usage or were not useful to end users (determined by Google Analytics and user interviews).
 
We also recommend retiring fields and functionality that essentially serves as a self-entered journal for patients. These “self-journaling” entries are data points that users enter that are part of their MHV account, but not visible by anyone else at VA. Examples from the personal information section include blood type, My Links, and the MHV health information card. 

In interviews, people talked about these kinds of items being confusing. 10 of 11 users expected the VA had access to the information they entered in these types of fields. They expect that the information will be shared with VA and have some kind of downstream effect at VA. 

Since that isn’t the case, they’re not useful and could contribute to mistrust in VA.

#### My Profile section
**Social security number**
- We learned from Carnetta Scruggs that this is already slated for removal from the MHV profile in September 2022.
- **Recommendation:** Follow MHV’s lead and don’t bring this over to the VA.gov profile.

**Gender**
- This field is equivalent to a field we tested labeled "Sex assigned at birth". Through [research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/personal-information/personal-information-revision/research/findings-summary.md#2-participants-who-identify-as-other-than-straight-or-cisgender-found-the-sex-assigned-at-birth-and-sexual-orientation-fields-triggering), we learned that this data point is triggering for some Veterans, particularly because it can’t be changed online. 
- We’ll be including a more inclusive gender identity field in June of 2022.
- **Recommendation:** Stick with our decision to keep this out of the VA.gov profile, and instead use gender identity.

**Martial status and current occupation**
- The MHV data for these fields does not impact any VA benefits for users.
- The majority of users we spoke with did not name these as fields that are important to them to update.
- **Recommendation:** Don’t bring these fields over to the VA.gov profile.

**What is your relationship to VA?** 
- We heard from stakeholders that the patient designation is important to them, but the rest of the options don’t have an impact outside of the MHV administration tool. 
- Stakeholders agreed that these options don’t have any utility for end-users.
- Stakeholders confirmed the options selected here don’t tie back to a VA database that impacts Veteran services or benefits.
- End users do not see their relationship with the VA as a changeable thing, so they were confused about the purpose of this field in their profile. It isn’t wasn’t important to them to be able to update it.
- **Recommendation:** We should continue to store this data for any meaningful internal VA purposes, but we shouldn't migrate this field to the VA.gov profile for end-users to self-journal their relationship.

**Blood type and organ donor**
- We heard from stakeholders that they feel these should not be editable fields in a VA.gov profile.
- We heard from users that they expect this information to be part of their medical record, and not something they need to update in their profile.
- **Recommendation:** Don’t move these as editable fields to the VA.gov profile. Have further discussions with health modernization team regarding how to handle health-related profile items (see below).

**Preferred method of contact**
- Since the VA is not set up to honor these preferences for all communications, it isn’t helpful for users to be able to update this setting. 
- **Recommendation:**  We shouldn't migrate this field to the VA.gov profile.

**Fax and pager**
- Stakeholders acknowledged that these were outdated methods of contact, and stated they were already planning to follow VA.gov profile and remove fax number.
- We removed Fax recently from the VA.gov profile at the recommendation of VA Profile, who let us know that stakeholders across the VA are not using fax as a means of communication with Veterans.
- Multiple users commented that these fields were outdated in our interviews.
- **Recommendation:** We shouldn’t migrate these fields to the VA.gov profile.

**My VA Treating facilities** 
- We heard from stakeholders that this field is used by help desk staff to assist VA patients, but help desk staff stated they didn’t use this information to support patients.
- Stakeholders also stated that this field was intended to support functionality that was never completed.
- End users were confused about the purpose of this field in their profile, and the impact it had on their medical records.  They assumed it would switch records from one VA medical center to another. 
- It wasn’t important to them to be able to update it, even if they actively receive care at multiple VA facilities listed in their profile. This validates the findings from the [June 2021 research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/research/may-2021-facilities-personalization-research/research-findings.md) we did to learn about the value of adding facilites to the VA.gov profile.
- If this data did have a larger impact on VA records, and wasn’t a self-journaling item, it *might* be important.
- **Recommendation:** We shouldn't migrate this field to the VA.gov profile.

**Account security questions and answers**
- Stakeholders shared that the MHV credential will be retired and users will have to log in with ID.me or Login.gov in the near future.
- Users shared they had used this field in the past to manage their account, and talked about the importance of being able to keep their account secure.
- **Recommendation**: We shouldn’t migrate these fields to the VA.gov profile since it’ll be irrelevant once the MHV credential is retired. However, we need to consider users that are accustomed to managing their account security in their profile and be sure it’s clear to them that is no longer necessary.

#### In case of emergency section
- We heard from stakeholders that the data in this field is strictly used to inform the printable health information wallet card, and isn’t accessible by VA staff in an emergency situation.
- We heard from users that it’s helpful to be able to manage this information **because they expect it’s part of their health record and accessible by VA staff**. This would be a helpful feature if it tied back to a VA database and updated emergency contact information within the health care system/ Since it doesn’t, it misleads and confuses users.
- **Recommendation:** We shouldn’t bring this over to the VA.gov profile in its current state. It’s worth adding this item to the list of  health-related profile items to discuss with the health modernization team.

#### Health information card
- Stakeholders shared that this feature was popular when MHV first launched, but that it’s functionality was never fully completed (only the address can be edited).
- 10 out of 11 users we spoke to had never used this card given that most things are digital today. They also didn’t expect that someone would search their wallet looking for this card if they were incapacitated. Some also saw it as duplicative of the card they use to check in for appointments.
- **Recommendation:** We shouldn’t bring this over to the VA.gov profile in its current state. It’s worth adding this item to the list of health-related profile items to discuss with the health modernization team.

#### My links
- We heard from stakeholders that this section is a remnant of an earlier era of digital tools, and is likely no longer useful.
- Users agreed; no users we spoke to had ever used this, and many found it confusing.
- **Recommendation:** We shouldn’t bring this over to the VA.gov profile. 

### 3. Plan to incorporate some functionality into the VA.gov profile
MHV currently has settings to manage email notifications for Rx Refill shipments, appointment reminders, medical images and report availability, and the MHV newsletter.

We’ll need to work closely with the MHV, VA Profile and VA Notify teams to successfully integrate this into VA.gov.  In our stakeholder interviews, we heard that transition discussions between MHV and VA Notify would start taking place soon, though we didn’t get an exact date

**Recommendation:** Get a status update of where MHV and VA Notify are today in planning, and determine when it makes sense for our team to start getting involved.

## Additional points to think about
### We should collaborate with the health apartment team to determine where it makes the most sense to put health-related profile items.

Our card sort revealed that it will likely be helpful to Veterans to reference health-related profile items in both the VA.gov profile and their health portal.  We’ll need to collaborate on a strategy of where makes the most sense for these data points to be managed vs linked.

Below are the results from our card sort showing which category made sense to the majority of our 11 participants. In some cases, it was a slim majority.

| Card | Category |
|---|---|
| Emergency contacts | My VA.gov Profile |
| Next of kin* | My VA.gov Profile |
| Notification settings for prescription shipping updates | My VA.gov Profile |
| Notification settings for the MHV newsletter | My Health Care |
| The ability to connect your health tracking device (like a FitBit)* | My Health Care |
| Your blood type | My Health Care |
| Your caregivers* | My Health Care |
| Your non-VA health insurance information (Note: this is self-entered on the health info card) | My VA.gov Profile |
| Your power of attorney* | My VA.gov Profile |
| Your providers and doctors (self-entered)* | My VA.gov Profile |

**Note**: * items indicates that these are **not** in MHV at the moment. These were exploratory items that the health apartment team asked us to include in our research, but this is not indicative of data that needs to move over in order to complete the MHV migration.

### We need to learn more about managing shipping addresses for prescriptions.
- We’ve learned that prescription shipping addresses aren’t managed in MHV, so we don’t need to be concerned with updating those as part of this transition.
- At a high-level, we know there are complexities and undefined problems related to prescription shipping addresses, including conditional logic based on the kind of medication and type of address (PO Box, mailing, home etc).
-  We need to have further conversations to define use cases and better understand all the problems in order to determine how the Veteran experience would improve if they could manage their prescription shipping address through the VA.gov profile.

### Determine the timing of retiring the MHV profile.
- We know new users will not be able to get a MHV credential starting in September 2022.
- We need to learn more about the MHV team’s plans for retiring the profile.
