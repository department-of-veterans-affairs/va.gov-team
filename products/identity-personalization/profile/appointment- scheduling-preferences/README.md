## Overview
The Elizabeth Dole Veterans Program Improvement Act of 2022 includes provisions aimed at enhancing veterans' access to healthcare services, including specific requirements related to appointment scheduling preferences. Here are some key points:

The act mandates that (VA) must take into account individual veterans' scheduling preferences to a reasonable extent when arranging appointments for healthcare services. This includes preferences for dates, times, and locations that best suit the veterans' needs and availability.

## Problem Statement
Veterans have different options and modalities for scheduling health care appointments but nowhere to enter in their preferences for how they'd like to complete scheduling. This means that VA staff may be reaching out in channels or at times that are not convenient to the Veteran or are wasting time and resources calling a veteran who would prefer to self schedule. 
 
## Desired User Outcomes

- As a Veteran, I want scheduling a health care appointment to be easy and happen how and when it is convenient for me.
- As a Veteran, I want the scheduling of community care appointments to happen quickly and efficiently.
- As a Veteran, I don't want to be contacted in channels or at times that are not convenient to me.
  
## Undesired User Outcomes
- As a Veteran, I don't want to set preferences for scheduling health care appointments and then have those preferences be ignored.
- As a Veteran, I 


## Desired Business Outcomes

- VA should be able to scheduling appointments more efficiently and reduce the amount of outreach and time spent on scheduling appointments.

## Undesired Business Outcomes

- Preferences should not lead to more confusion and overhead for VA staff responsible for scheduling health care appointments.

## Measuring Success


### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
* _What are the most important metrics that track with this product/initiative's success?_
* _Include links to Domo or Google Analytics Dashboards/Reports_
* _**Limit 5-6 KPIs per product**__

| Category | Ease of use | Service completion | Trust/Satisfaction | Health |
|----------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------|
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |

#### Baseline KPI Values
* _Baseline values for those most critical metrics. These may come from other systems other than VA.gov e.g. eBenefits._

### Objectives and Key results (OKRs)
_What are the measurable targets you're aiming for that delivers value for Veterans?_

- Objective: Improve the experience of scheduling a community care appointment
  - Key result: Reduce the # of contact attempts needed to get an appointment scheduled.
  - Key result: Reduce the time from appt requested to appt scheduled
  - Key result: Overall usage of appointment scheduling preferences
  - Key result: CSAT of appointment scheduling preferences

## Assumptions
- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumption w/your initial set of functionality*

## Solution Approach

As a Veteran I want to document 4 specific preferences related to Veteran health care appointment scheduling preferences (see below)

Our idea is to store the preferences in VA profile, enable Veterans to update them in the VA.gov profile, and enable schedulers/MSAs to also be able to view/update them in ISS.

(1) How and when the veteran prefers to be contacted about an appointment for health care.
(2) Whether the veteran prefers to schedule appointments without the assistance of the Department, if able.
(3) Whether the veteran prefers to select a provider without the assistance of the Department, if able.
(4) Whether the veteran prefers appointments to be scheduled during certain days or times.


### Supporting research

This work is not supported by user research because it comes from a specific call out in Congressional legislation with an associated timeline. The first iteration of this project is primarily based off the text of the legislation rather than documented research on a specific problem and will launch without input from research. However, there will be a simultaneous research effort that will inform future work as well as data collected from the initial launched product. 


### Initiatives
