# Profile 2.0 Release Plan 
---

## Phase I: UAT

### Planning:
- **Date range or test duration** Estimated: Tuesday, 9/1 - Friday, 9/4
- **Desired number of users:** 10 users
- **How you'll recruit the right production test users:** We will recruit users via Perigean. 
  - (We need to make sure that we have the email the user uses to log into Va.gov ahead of time)
- **How you'll conduct the testing:** We will conduct UAT over Zoom to ensure the different features work correctly.
- **How you'll give the test users access to the product in production w/o making it live on VA.gov:** We will have the new profile launched to production but hidden behind a feature flag. We'll give participants access to this feature by adding their email addresses to a list of users who can see the new profile. 
  - (We need to make sure to include users who have Direct Deposit)

[UAT Plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/Combine%20Profile%20and%20Account/Research/UAT/profile-research-plan-UAT.md)

### Additional notes on UAT
 LOA 1 users
- 2 users
- Can be people from our team who have LOA1 prod accounts. We shouldn't use perigean to recruit for this.

LOA3 users
- 4 users who have direct deposit (receive comp & pen benefits)
- 4 who do not have direct deposit (do no receive comp & pen benefits)
Connected apps â€” We should see if the connected apps team has a prod account or can create a prod account that shows what it looks like to have at least one app connected. Perigean won't be able to recruit for this.

**Erik to teach Matt/Tressa/Sandra how to use the feature flag/flipper**
- Need to be added to list of people with flipper access
- Erik to enter instructions

#### Design UAT notes
- Tressa will put together the formal research plan and script for UAT.
- Tressa will also conduct these session.

#### Frontend UAT notes
- Erik and Sandra will be responsible for launching the new profile to production behind a feature flag and giving participants access to the feature.
- They will have the option to attend UAT and be responsible for any frontend bugs/fixes.
  - (Primarily Matt and Tressa in these sessions)

#### Backend UAT notes
- The new profile did not require any backend work, as it was primarily a frontend redesign. However, should any backend issues come up, Lihan will be available to fix them before we move into a phased launch.

### Results:
- **Number of users:**
- **Number of bugs identified / fixed:**
- **Was the data submitted (if any) easy for VA to process?:**
- **Types of errors logged:**
- **Any UX changes necessary based on the logs, or feedback on user challenges, or VA challenges?** 
- **If yes, what: lorem ipsum** 

## Phase II: Staged Rollout

### The Plan

**Desired date range:** 9/9/20 - 9/23/20 

**How will you make the product available in production while limiting the number of users who can access it?** 

We will launch the new profile behind a feature flag and and control what % of users see it using Flipper. 

- Launch behind a feature flag. Test with team. (1 day)
- If things go well, we'll launch to 25% of traffic. (1 week)
- If things go well, we'll launch to 50% of users. (1 week)
- If everything looks good, we'll then launch to 100% of users.

**What metrics-based criteria will you look at before advancing rollout to the next stage?:** 

We will monitor the following metrics to ensure there are no issues:

- Profile visits

For each section:
- Successful retrievals 
- Failed retrievals
- Form Submits
- Successful submissions
- Failed form submissions
- Error counts

Links to dashboards showing "success criteria" metrics: [insert link to dashboard] TBD

## Post-launch Questions 

_To be completed once you have gathered your initial set of data, as outlined above._ 

1. How do the KPIs you gathered compare to your pre-launch definition(s) of "success"?
1. What qualitative feedback have you gathered from users or other stakeholders, if any?
1. Which of the assumptions you listed in your product outline were/were not validated? 
1. How might your product evolve now or in the future based on these results?


# Go-to-market Strategy
- *How are Veterans and others using this product going to know it exists?*
  - The profile on VA.gov is an already existing feature. 
- *What marketing, outreach, or communications are necessary for this product to be successful?*
  - We would like to have a a "tool tip" or icon next to the profile that will let the user know that the "Account"     and "Profile" and merged into "Profile"
  - This would be active during the phased launch to reduce confusion regarding where they can find/change their    
    account security information.
  - We are working directly with Leslie Byford to determine what is feasible in terms of changes to the VA.gov  
     homepage.
