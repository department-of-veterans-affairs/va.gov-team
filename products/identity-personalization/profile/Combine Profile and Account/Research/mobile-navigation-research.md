**Digital Services Veterans Affairs (DSVA), VSA**<br>

## Overview

In recent research for the effort to combine profile and account on VA.gov, we discovered that participants had a difficult time using the mobile subnavigation within the new profile design.  We recommended making the mobile subnavigation clearer for the logged in experience.  Since this is something that might effect the site as a whole, this is possibly a two-tier solution. First, there should be a short term fix specific to the profile, followed by a more involved long term solution based on previous research and more comprehensive mobile navigation needs.

In the The last statistic she remembers is about 1/3 all traffic is mobile. Joanne on the VSP platform could have new numbers now though

This document is a place to store any findings made by other designers concerning Mobile Navigation for ease of hand-off in future design efforts.

## Gathered Research

Authenticated Experience, [Profile 2.0 Research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/edit/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/Combine%20Profile%20and%20Account/Research/cpaa-research-findings.md)

- **Specifically in mobile, participants had a difficult time finding the 'profile menu', and in general were confused about the mobile navigation.**
Most participants looked elsewhere (i.e. Menu, 'Kim') to navigate through the profile and had a difficult time finding the profile menu. Most commonly people looked for their name for navigation, stating that it was something they were familiar with and had used in other apps. Furthermore, participants seemed confused about the difference in functionality between Menu, 'User Name' Menu, and 'Profile Menu'.
 > “...my only complaint is the profile menu did not stand out...”
 
 > "I was just thinking my info, I did not think of profile menu. I have never… I don’t know. I would click on my name and my info would be there or my name would be there?"
 
 > "I kept clicking under the name and I didn’t pay attention to the bar. Which actually says profile menu. I automatically went to the name… but like I said profile menu is right there, so once I saw that I was able to navigate from there."
 
 > "Let’s see... the only thing that they have is my 'go to' ...it's to go to my name for the profile menu..."
 
 > "I know for me it was an oversight on my part because my mind automatically went to looking for my name, but it’s right… there. I mean. It could be a different color, or it could be capitalized, but other than that, you have this blue bar right there, I just missed it… probably because I was scrolling up real fast and my mind was on checking under my name."
 
 If users couldn't find what they were looking for in any of the menus on mobile, they would give up and go to the search bar.
 > "Like I said, if there’s something I’m not sure of or know exactly where to find it, search bar is there."
 
 > "I can’t actually click anywhere. But I would click out and try to find it in one of the search tool boxes..."
