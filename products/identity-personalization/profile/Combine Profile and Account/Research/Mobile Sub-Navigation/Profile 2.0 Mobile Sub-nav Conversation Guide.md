## Intro 

Thanks so much for joining us today! Today we're going to talk about the new profile design that we're building for VA.gov.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session will be quick, it should take less than fifteen minutes.** 
- **We are going to be testing everything on mobile today.** If you have any questions about how to find anything on zoom, feel free to ask.
- **As always, we want to hear your honest opinions.** 
- **Please go slower than you normally would and if you could talk aloud about what you are doing, that would be great.** 
  
## Screenshare

I'm going to send you a link to a prototype in the chat. If you can copy that link to your phone and then click the 'share screen' in Zoom.  Then if you select 'Website URL' and then paste it in that field and click 'Share'. 

Try to move a bit slower than you normally would on a website and talk me through your actions. For these scenarios we are going to assume that you have logged-in and navigated to your profile and landed on this page.

## Questions

**Scenario**

1. From here, could you double check that the VA has the correct banking information for you?

2. Great, from here, could you show me how you'd edit the email address you use to log into VA.gov?

3. Overall, did you find it easy or hard to navigate through the profile? Why?

4. What are your thoughts on the profile menu itself? Did you find it easy or hard to use? Why?

5. Do you have any additional thoughts or questions for me?

### Things to watch for:

- I noticed you clicked [this]. Talk about why you chose this.
- Does the participant find the profile menu?
- Does the participant understand how to use the profile menu?

## Thank-You and Closing
