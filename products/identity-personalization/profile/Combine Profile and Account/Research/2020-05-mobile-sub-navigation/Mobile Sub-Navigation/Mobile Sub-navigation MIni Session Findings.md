## Overview

The goal of this research is to understand if the design changes made to Profile 2.0 based off previous research findings were successful. The main issue with the current design was in mobile view. Participants had a difficult time finding the 'profile menu', and in general were confused about the mobile navigation. Most commonly people looked for their name for navigation, stating that it was something they were familiar with and had used in other apps. 

A secondary issue is that users were unsure what email address was represented in the Personal and Contact Information section (contact vs log-in). Participants didn't notice the 'more information' drop down, and even after reading the 'More Information' content, there was confusion about updating the contact email vs the log-in email. 

Based off these issues we made the following recommendations for design changes:

- Make mobile subnavigation clearer for the logged in experience - this is possibly a two-tier solution. First, there should be a short term fix specific to the profile, followed by a more involved long term solution based on previous research and more comprehensive mobile navigation needs.
- Add clarification around email address in Personal and Contact information and add email address to Account Security.

We ran these sessions with 5 co-workers using the mobile zoom app.

## Findings

1. All participants easily found the 'Your profile menu' on the page. Only one participant expected it to be above the 'nametag' area of the screen, but still was able to navigate easily through the pages.

2. All participants were still confused about if the email address in Personal and contact information would change the email address used to log-in.  None of the participants read any of the content in the blue box.

3. All participants noted that the DD header was much too long.

## Recommendations
- Move forward with new mobile sub-navigation design.
- Add clarifiers to the email address section in Personal and contact information.
- Work with copy to shorten the DD header.
