# Research Plan for VSA Authenticated Experience: Combine Profile and Account
Prepared by Tressa Furner, Ad Hoc | March 2020

## Goals

The goal of this research is to understand user comprehension after combining current 'profile' and 'account' into one page as part of the personalization 2.0 effort. This includes:

- does the user feel like the design reflects them personally
- can the user find the information that they are looking for effectively
- how does the side navigation effect task efficiency
- how easily can the user change information within the profile

## Background

The [personalization 2.0](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/personalization%202.0/README.md) effort aims to reimagine and expand the existing personalized functionality on VA.gov in order to better meet user needs and expectations. The first leg of this effort is combining the existing profile and account pages into one section. [Our research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/personalization%202.0/Combine%20Profile%20and%20Account/Research) showed us that these two sections — which are currently separate — have enough similarities in users' minds that we'd be better meeting user needs by combining these two pages. In addition to combining these two pages, this redesign aims to update the visual design and information architecture of the new section to be easier to scan and overall more usable.

## Research questions

- Can people find what they're looking for in the profile?
- Do users understand how to update their information??
- What information is important for them to see first?
- Do the terms we use on the profile make sense/mean anything to users?
- Has the side nav increased scanability of the new profile? Do people find what the need easily?
- Do saving/errors interactions feel intuitive?
- Do people understand why some info isn't editable, and how to update it?
- How does the overall nav effect visibility of the profile? Is it easy to find?
- How do people think the new profile compares to profile/account 1.0?
- Do people understand what connected accounts are? Do they want to see this section of the profile if they don't have connected accounts?
- Where would people go to change the email address they use to sign in?
- Does the mobile nav and placement make sense? 
- Do users understand the 'learn more' sections? Are they actually representing the most 'frequently asked questions'?
- Can people find what they're looking for in the profile?
- Does the labeling on the left nav make sense?


## Hypothesis 

- We'll find some terminology that needs updating.
- People will prefer 2.0 to 1.0.
- The side nav will go over really well and increase scanability.
- Saving and error interactions will be intuitive and meet expectations.
- The mobile navigation will be hard to find and understand.
- Participants may not understand why or how to edit "personal information"
- Participants might be confused about Connected Accounts and what that means

## Method

- We will use Zoom to conduct remote moderated usability testing sessions to observe how participants use profile 2.0.  We will be using primarily mobile views in InVision.

## Participants and Recruitment

We will work with Perigean to reach our goal of observing 5-6 participants.

Criteria for recruiting:

- 8 sessions scheduled
- At least 3 people who use the apple health app (this is preferred, but optional)
- At least 1 woman
- At least 1 person of color
- At least 1 participant 35 or under and 1 participant over 55
- At least one person with cognitive disabilities
- Be able to screenshare via Zoom. Please confirm with them that they have Zoom downloaded prior to the session and they know how to screenshare. If they can not get Zoom working, there is no interview portion of this research and they will not be able to participate.

## Timeline 	
This study will take place on April 6-10, 2020.
Each session will be approximately 60 minutes.
