# Combining profile & account usability testing

Note-taker: Carey Otto

*Participant 8, April 9, 2020, noon ET*

## Intro (5 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Tressa and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about the profile on the VA website.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about an hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototypes and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits. At some points we will be using the mobile version of the website for this study - so just use your mouse like you'd use your finger on a phone. Also, all of these pages were made using a completely made up person with completely fake information. This will not affect your account or information in any way.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 
    
    **Participant:** Notes here

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?"** 

## Warm-up Questions

**Moderator: Before we look at the website, letâ€™s start with a few warm-up questions.Tell me about your service history OR tell me about yourself**

**Participant:** 
Joined airforce in Nov 68, served for 25 years, getting out in 1993 and was in assignments around the world as an airforce officer, but I did not serve a tour in Vietnam at that time. I was in Vietnam through TDY and therefore qualify for disability from the VA. Currently receiving benefits 100% for prostate cancer. Applied for benefits on paper.
 
**Moderator: Have you ever been to VA.gov?**

**Participant:** 
Yes. Since receiving this disability in 2019, prior to that I was going to VA.gov more frequently,since then have not gone very frequently.
 
**Moderator: (if yes) How often do you use VA.gov on average?**

**Participant:** 
 
**Moderator:  What do you typically do on Va.gov?**

**Participant:** 
When I was trying to find lab results in 2019, in order to maintain disability. Every 6 months you have to have a mtg with a doctor and take lab results, and so far have been uable to get those results. I have been told there are 2 sides to VA, one side is the health side and the others are the benefits side and the they don't talk to each other. I have not been able to get into the website? benefits? to ... get lab results to that side 

**Moderator:  Have you ever used VA.gov to update your personal information?**

**Participant:** 
I haven't had the need

**Moderator:(if yes) Can you tell me about this experience?**

**Participant:** 

**Moderator:(if yes) Can you tell me what you were specifically doing?**

**Participant:** 

**Moderator:Do you remember what forms you used??**

**Participant:** 

**Moderator:Are you currently recieving any benefits from the VA? Which ones?**

**Participant:** 

**Moderator:Did you get these by applying through the website? When?**

**Participant:**

**Have you ever connected any outside apps to your VA health records? (*clarifier*) (For example, it's possible to connect your health app from your iphone to your VA health records.)** 
There is the Apple Health app that has offered to make connections, but I haven't pursued that. I have 2 health apps that have medical records in, one is called My Chart and let's just say that's it. It's a little confusing, there seems to be 2 different ones but as time progresses, more and more hospitals are offering access.

I don't think I've connected any apps. (paraphrasing)

## Screenshare

**Moderator: I'm going to ask you to go to VA.gov on your browser.  Once you have it pulled up, will you share your screen with me?  Click the  "Share" button in Zoom.  For these exercises we would like to simulate a mobile experience so if you could make your browser screen narrow like a phone screen that would be great. Try to move a bit slower than you normally would on a website and talk me through your actions. Information shown will not reflect any of your actual information.**  

## First Task: Wayfinding and profile navigation (Mobile View) (20 minutes)

**Moderator: You have recently moved and you've come to the VA website because you need to update your mailing address. Show me what you would do to change your mailing address. Okay, since you will need to be logged-in for this task, we're going to use a prototype with fake information and I'll send you the link. (*send link*) Now you've found the location and landed on this page. Just as a reminder - all of the information in this prototype is completely made up.  We will be logging in as 'Kim Washington' (who is completely fictional) today and if you could pretend to be her for these exercises, that would be great. Alright, just a reminder - you are trying to update your mailing address.**

**Participant:** 
I'd probably have to sign in. But I see a menu button, let me see what's there. [scrolls down screen and clicks "change your address]. Feedback modal [moderator instructs to dismiss.] [Reads FAQ directions.] [Clicks "go to VA.gov profile" which opens sign in modal.]

TRANSITIONS TO PROTOTYPE (struggles with transition)

[Scrolls to bottom of screen, looking for "update your records" like found in live site. Isn't finding the link, but is drawn to "Records" link. Doesn't quite seem right.] Oh, now I see Records more towards the top and "change your address" link. I didn't see that at the time, but its more obvious now. [Clicks Change my address Clicks "Edit your address" header in step 4.] Looks like I should be able to click on something here, but clicking doesn't seem to do anything for me. Should I go back to sign in to VA.gov. There seems to be a highlight around Edit your address but nothing seems to be activated, but what should I do?

[moderator prompts to click on sign in]

Who did you say I was going to be? [Kim Washington - and you are trying to update your mailing address]
 Okay, I click the edit button. Do you want me to put something in there? [clicks to autofill prototype]. So then... so this is, how do I update my personal information? Not sure if this is part of your test... is it the updated information I clicked in. Okay, then I click the update button. 

**Moderator: (*On the Edit form*) Since this is a prototype, we are going to simulate typing in a new address by having you click into any of the fields in this form. That will update the whole address. (*On the updated form*) OK, now you have entered a new address.**

**Participant:** 

**Moderator:**

Things to look for: 
- I noticed you got to the form to change your address from (*homepage*) or (*through the profile*) why did you go there?
- Was it easy or hard to find where to edit your personal information?
- Take a look at the 'personal information' section: what information would you expect us to see here? Is anything missing?
- Did you feel like it was easy or hard to edit your mailing address overall?
- Why do you think we show a mailing address and home address?
- Is it clear to you what parts of the page are editable?
- Did that exercise make sense to you?

**Participant:** 

- I was looking for anything that would help me change my address.

- Apparently I skimmed past the first opportunity and got further down the page and had to work my way back to the easy way. [what was the easy way?] At the top of the page, there's a direct way to edit my personal information. That's the easy way. The other way showed me a 4 step process and it indicated I was already on step 4, but apparently I wasn't. I had to go back to step 2.

- No that is what I would expect to see

- You can't do your birthdate or gender - you get in trouble for that because I want to pick one of the 57 genders I could be. But otherwise, yes, it looks like I could edit most of the other fields.

- It was easy to edit my address becaus the blocks showed up to be filled in, I know how to do that, so therefore it was easy.
**Moderator: Great, from here, could you double check that any payments that you might recieve from the VA are going to get to you?**

**Participant:** 
... where they send my VA checks, let's see. Profile, profile menu, direct deposit information, that's what I'd be concerned with. Seems like I can get banking information there.

**Moderator: Did that make sense to you?**

**Participant:** 
I would call that easy

**Moderator: Was anything confusing?**

**Participant:** 
Yeah, when I looked at the profile it was very easy to figure out even though you said banking info and the screen said direct deposit info, i could figure out those were the same

**Moderator: Could you go ahead and open the profile menu? Okay, without clicking into any of the sections - could you explain to me what you think each one might be used for?**

**Participant:** 
I would expect military info = my info from dd214
direct deposit = show where new checks sent
account security = I'd be curious to what that is. Does it refer to my bank account or something with my account with the VA in general
connected apps = i'd be curious what apps are connected
**Moderator:  Go ahead and click on Account Security and look over this section. Does this section match your expectations?**

**Participant:**
[user clicks account security]
Okay so now I understand with account security you're talking about the online account I have with the VA and setting up 2 factor does a better job of ensuring its me trying to look into the account

[any other thoughts about this?]

It doesn't actually look like there's a choice for 2FA, as you go through there you're just led into setting it up. You don't have a choice to say you're not interested.

**Moderator: Could you scroll up to the the dark grey box below the header with your name in it? What are your thoughts about this area?**

**Participant:**
Looks like Kimberly was in the army at least. Uh... it just... I would assume if it was my name it would just be first name, middle name and last name. I have to guess that Kimberly was somewhere either married to a Smith or Washington -- I don't follow those hyphenated names very well. These are just my thoughts. I don't know Kimberly.

[thoughts on how this fits into the overall page]
The emblem could be smaller. We can pretty much recognize our service emblem. It's not critical to this spot and doesn't need to be big.

### Things to watch for:

- I noticed you clicked [this]. Talk about why you chose this.
- How does the participant interact with the nametag area of the page? Do they skip over it?
- Do they understand why they can't edit all parts of the page?

## Second Task: Connected Apps (Mobile View) (10 minutes)

**Moderator: Okay, great. Now we are going to walk through another scenario.  Imagine that last month, you used your iPhone's Health app to share your VA medical records with a non-VA doctor. But now you've decided you want to remove the Health app's access to your VA records. ** 

**Participant:** 

**Moderator: Could you walk me through how you would do that? **

**Participant:** 

[looks around page... scrolls to bottom... slowly scrolls back up] I'm looking for something that puts him into the health side of VA.gov. this looks more like its about account profile. I would either go to Veterans programs and services or try to find something more akin to my health records.

[moderator gives instructions to click into profile menu - connected apps]
Ahhh... that's pretty obvious. This looks pretty easy! [Clicks disconnect without hesitation, doesn't seem to read anything]. 

**Moderator: Do you know if your information from this app is completely removed from VA.gov? **

**Participant:** 

(After asked question, scrolls and seems to read confirmation modal.) It seems to make sense, it can't remove what was previously shared. Doctor on other end may have printed it out, etc.

[how do you feel about that?]
that's about as good as you can do, once you share something I don't see why it would be possible to get it back

**Moderator: Was anything confusing to you in this process?
-(if yes) where would you look for answers?
-(if no) imagine you did have concerns, where would you go for more information?**

**Participant:** 

[confusing?]
Not once I realized where I could find connected apps.

Before you told me how to get there, I would have just had to be guessing because there wasn't anything that seemed to show me that apps were connected.

[where would you go for help?]
I'd go to the menu... i can't get back there. After I can't find what I'm looking for, I try the contact us or I might search for app connections or connected apps

**Moderator: How would you connect a different app to your VA health records?
(if confused - add clarifiers): If you wanted to find new apps on your phone to use with VA.gov, where would you look? **

**Participant:** 
Now that I know its under profile, I would go to profile - aps, oh here at the bottom it says have questions, find apps you can use. I'd probably go there to see if I can use an app.

**Moderator: Alright, I have a few follow-up questions for you about this scenario: What did you expect to see in the 'connected apps' section? **

**Participant:** 

[confusing?]
I'd rather see something first that says "to connect apps go someplace and to disconnect apps go someplace." I'd like to see that up at the top.

I'd like the menu to tell me what's in there and then go to the page. This is the right thing, when I click profile it tells me (reads sub nav list). Connected apps gives me the impression I already connected apps. It doesn't tell me this is the place to go connect to apps.

**Moderator: Do you have any questions about the process we just looked at?**

**Participant:** 

**Moderator: Did you find it easy or hard to navigate using the menu at the top of the page?**

**Participant:** 

I don't know, am I on the homepage now with profile at the top or is there a homepage that has a place to look at profile? See I can't get to home from here (because not clickable in prototype), it's confusing me.

### Things to watch for:

- Do they understand where to go for 'Connected apps'?
- Do they understand that they cannot connect a new app through VA.gov?
- Does the terminology 'connected apps' make sense?
- Make note of how user interacts with navigation.  Is it easy to use and to find?

## Third Task: Wayfinding and profile navigation (Desktop) (10 minutes)

**Moderator: Okay, we're going to switch gears and take a look at the desktop view.  We will start from the VA.gov homepage again, so if you could return to your browser with VA.gov and expand the screen so you're viewing it how you'd normally look at it. (*From VA.gov homepage*) Okay, so for this scenario you'd like to double check that the VA has the correct dates for the time that you were in the military.  How would you do that?**

**Participant:** 
DD214 should have my correct dates, so if I wanted to see what they were the first thing I would do is check that (in records box on homepage - request military records (DD214)). If they were wrong, now I would be confused.

[moderator prompts to sign in -]



**Moderator:(*send link*) Okay, you'll have to be logged in for the next step, so here's a link to the desktop protoype.  Again, this has all fake information with a fake person - Kim Washington.**

**Participant:** 
Profile. Mmm hmmm.. (scrolls up and down). Ah, military information (click sidbar), okay. (Hovers over FAQ)
**Moderator: Do you understand what information on the page is editable?**

**Participant:**

**Moderator: Do you understand why you can't edit military information?**

**Participant:**
Your DD214 is an official document, you can't just change it willy nilly

**Moderator: Was anything confusing? **

**Participant:**
Proflie info is info about you and military inof is pretty pertinant.

**Moderator: Great, from here, could you show me how you'd edit the email address you use to log into VA.gov?**

**Participant:**
I would go to here and find my email address and edit this (finds it with ease)
(Then wants to click FAQ question - reads out loud)
"see this is the typcial thing in the computer that aggravates me, go to the account where you manage your settings... what do you mean? On my phone on my desktop, on my email system? What account are we talking about?

That's just my general... I would assume if I had an account access to VA, that would be teh email account I was using to access the VA. But I have password managers that hold my user id and passwords for something like 300 different places to go. I have 3 different emails that I manage 3 different types of emails from. I have my account on my desktop computer where I manage different things. In this case, it just says "go to my account where I manage my settings..." well I have a desktop account where I manage my settings and that's where I can change what email accounts I want to go to my desktop vs. what's going to stay online. I just don't know exactly what that means.

**Moderator: Do you understand why you need to go to an outside page to edit your email address? **

**Participant:**

**Moderator: I have a few follow up questions. Was it easy or hard to find the pages you needed? **

**Participant:**
I tend to look at the right hand side of pg to find menus. If this profile menu wasn't above personal contact info, essentially its a menu block, I tend to look on right hand side for menues so I didn't see it right away because it was smaller and less outstanding than personal contact information.

**Moderator: Was anything confusing? **

**Participant:**

### Things to watch for:

- Does the overall desktop navigation make sense?
- Is the user confused by any terminology?
- Does the user understand the FAQ dropdowns?

## Fourth Task: Profile and Profile 2.0 Comparison (5 minutes)

**Moderator: I'm going to quickly show you a different version of the profile (moderator shares screen with previous profile).**

**Participant:**
Looks like the mobile version. First off it does what I say it should do, menu is at the top and I know I can go from menu to area I want to go to.

On the desktop example, menu was off to the side and personal contact info looked more important than menu


**Moderator: Do you remember if you ever used this version? (*if yes*) What did you do on here? (*if no*) What are your thoughts on these pages vs the pages we looked at earlier?** 

**Participant:**
I prefer to live site

The other menu was more colorful, this one looks less dramatic, but the order of this one is better. It could have some color added to it as far as banners and headings, but otherwise I like the order of this one better.

**Moderator: Based on going through this flow, would you prefer to use the version we used today or this version? 

**Participant:**

**Moderator: Why?** 

**Participant:**

**Moderator: How would this version be different??**

**Participant:**

## Post-Task Interview 

**Moderator: OK, those are all the screens we are going to look at today. I just have a few more questions for you. **

**Participant:**

**Moderator: What are your overall impressions of the new VA.gov profile we viewed today?**

**Participant:**

**Moderator: What are your overall impressions of navigating through the profile?**

**Participant:**
It looked fairly simple to navigate.

[why?]
in terms of highlights... the colorfulness of it all is good, the way it lines up your profile is fine, my only complaint is the profile menu did not stand out

**Moderator: Overall, how could we improve the VA profile?**

**Participant:**
It seems adequete to me.

**Moderator: Any questions you have for me?**

## Thank-You and Closing

**Moderator: Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.  As a thank you for your participation, we'd like to send you a $50 thank-you check. This will be sent by (Brian/Shannon from) Perigean, the people that recruited you to talk to us today. They'll work with you to figure out the right place to send it.  Any questions before we sign off?**

**Participant:**
Who are the other 3 people in the conversation? [My collegeaus, taking notes for me.] Good.

**Moderator: Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!**
