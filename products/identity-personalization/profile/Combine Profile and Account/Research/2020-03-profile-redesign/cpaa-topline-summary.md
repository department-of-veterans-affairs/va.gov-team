This topline summary is a result of the synthesis that happens after conducting/observing research sessions. This is a high level summary of trends and analysis, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.

**The goal of this document is:**
 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data

## Research Questions & Answers
**Can people find what they're looking for in the profile?**
 - Overall - yes. All participants found what they were looking for eventually regardless of how often they use VA.gov. 
 - All participants expressed tasks to be 'easy' (once they were more familiar with layout and navigation)
 - All participants were able to locate the profile page from the home page on both mobile and desktop
 - All participants were able to easily understand most terminology within navigation and content of the profile
 - Users often tried to use 'search' rather than the profile menu to find what they are looking for
 - Almost all participants mentioned they expected to see their benefit information somewhere on the profile (if this is possible - I think this would be a valuable addition)
 - All participants thought that the military badge on mobile was taking up too much space, 2/5 thought it was unnecessary all together.
 -Recommendations: Remove/size down military badge on mobile, add in benefit information (if possible)
 
**Do users understand how to update their information?**
 - Yes - it was clear on which parts of the page were editable.
 - If users did not know where to go for answers, they all clicked on the FAQ link.
 - There was confusion surrounding email address.  All users could update their email but none were sure if it updated their log-in email vs contact information. 
 - 3/5 participants mentioned they might want to add an additional email address 
 - Recommendation: Provide some clarification stating that the email address shown is NOT tied to your email used to log-in

**Does the mobile nav and placement make sense?**
 - Most participants had a difficult time locating the 'profile menu' within mobile - almost all of them clicked on 'Menu' or 'Kim' to get to where they wanted. 
 - Many mentioned that they skipped over it initially, but once they found it they used it easily
 - Recommendation: Design and terminology need to be updated on the 'profile menu' bar. Possibly change it back to 'More in this section' as seen in other parts of the VA mobile experience
 
**Has the side nav increased scanability of the new profile? Do people find what the need easily?**
 - When comparing old profile vs new profile 4/5 participants said they preferred the new profile specifically calling out the ease of use in navigation and overall 'less cluttered' layout
 - All participants said they preferred desktop navigation to mobile navigation.
 - All participants thought that the side nav was 'easy' to use
 - Most participants thought the profile navigation contained everything they expected, if they thought it was missing something it was always 'benefits'
 - When looking through Account Security, most participants said they would expect to change their password here

**Do people understand what connected apps are?**
 - Mostly yes. 4/5 participants had heard of connected apps, though none had ever connected any.
 - Overall most participants did not read any of the long text on the screens (i.e. connected apps 'explanation', app disconnected messaging)
 - No participants seemed concerned that their information was not fully deleted off of VA.gov after disconnecting an app
 - All participants easily found FAQs and 'Find apps you can use'
 - There was some confusion about how to add an app - even after they found the 'find apps you can use' link

## Hypotheses & Answers
**The mobile navigation will be hard to find and understand.**
 - True
 - Most participants looked elsewhere (i.e. Menu, 'Kim') to navigate through the profile and had a difficult time finding the profile menu.
 > “...my only complaint is the profile menu did not stand out...”
 > "I was just thinking my info, I did not think of profile menu. I have never… I don’t know. I would click on my name and my info would be there or my name would be there?"
 > "I kept clicking under the name and I didn’t pay attention to the bar. Which actually says profile menu. I automatically went to the name… but like I said profile menu is right there, so once I saw that I was able to navigate from there."
 
**The side nav will go over really well and increase scanability.**
 - True
 - 4/5 participants preferred the new side nav design to the old profile design.
 > “You can go through and see most relevant info. It seems pretty intuitive. Once you are here. That something a lot of the VA profile did not have in the past, it was more utilitarian and was not intuitive, not a lot of thought process put into it. This makes it user friendly.”
 > "You know, looking at the older site, like I said it just seemed like there was a lot more going on, which can be confusing for...I was going to say for like older Veterans, but I guess for everyone really."

**Participants might be confused about Connected Apps and what that means**
 - Partially true
 - Most participants understood and easily grasped the concept of Connected Apps, though there was some confusion about how to connect apps.
 > “Its intuitive, It’s similar to other apps I use for uhm, like Drop Box per-say, where I have other apps that have access to it. Where I can have access to verify who has access to it and I can block them or allow it. It’s good.”
 > "...because it’s third party access, they need to be connected in the first place. Umm, so I would imagine you both connect and disconnect in the same place..."
 
## Other Findings
**Finding**
- Email address needs more clarification in general
> “So it look like it connects for corresponded, it’s not intuitive that that is your log in because I do not remember being able to use an email address to log in...”
> "I’m thinking it’s just the site… not sure if it changes everything across the board but anything pertaining to the site"

**Finding**
- Users liked the 'name-tag' area, but it's taking up too much space. Especially in mobile.
> “I really like coming in and seeing my service Army there. It’s a nice little feeling like a reminder a way to feel connected.”
> “The emblem could be smaller. We can pretty much recognize our service emblem. It's not critical to this spot and doesn't need to be big.”

**Finding**
- Users want to see their benefit information on the profile.
> “The only other thing I would say is possibility benefit information. And again, that might include education options, your disability stuff I don’t know, or go to a menu that link to those things. If I was coming to this and scrolling through it would be nice to have it all in one spot.”
