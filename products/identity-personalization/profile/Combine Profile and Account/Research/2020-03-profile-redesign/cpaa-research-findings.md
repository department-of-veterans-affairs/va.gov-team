View the [Research Plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/Combine%20Profile%20and%20Account/Research/User%20Research.md).
## Research Goals 

The goal of this research is to understand user comprehension after combining current 'profile' and 'account' into one page as part of the personalization 2.0 effort. This includes:

- Does the user feel like the design reflects them personally?
- Can the user find the information that they are looking for effectively?
- How does the side navigation effect task efficiency?
- How easily can the user change information within the profile?

Prior to the research we hypothesized that:

- We'll find some terminology that needs updating.
- People will prefer the new profile to the old profile.
- The side nav will go over really well and increase scanability.
- Saving and error interactions will be intuitive and meet expectations.
- The mobile navigation will be hard to find and understand.
- Participants may not understand why or how to edit "personal information".
- Participants might be confused about Connected Apps and what that means.

## Research Methodology 

We used Zoom to conduct remote moderated usability testing sessions to observe how participants use the new profile.  We used prototypes in Invision using primarily [mobile view](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/34WJ8JOCMAB) followed by [desktop view](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/FJW9OGY2B9A).

### Who we talked to

- 5 Veterans
- Ages varied from 35-65 (exact demographics unknown)
- 3 out of 5 Veterans were currently receiving benefits
- No participants had any connected apps

### Research Questions

- Can people find what they're looking for in the profile?
- Do users understand how to update their information?
- What information is important for them to see first?
- Do the terms we use on the profile make sense/mean anything to users?
- Has the side nav increased scanability of the new profile? Do people find what the need easily?
- Do saving/errors interactions feel intuitive?
- Do people understand why some info isn't editable, and how to update it?
- How does the overall nav effect visibility of the profile? Is it easy to find?
- How do people think the new profile compares to the old profile/account?
- Do people understand what connected apps are? Do they want to see this section of the profile if they don't have connected apps?
- Where would people go to change the email address they use to sign in?
- Does the mobile nav and placement make sense? 
- Do users understand the 'learn more' sections? Are they actually representing the most 'frequently asked questions'?
- Can people find what they're looking for in the profile?
- Does the labeling on the left nav make sense?

## Key Findings
1. Participants preferred the new profile design to the old design, and easily found what they were looking for within the profile using the new navigation.
2. The side nav increased scanability of the overall profile, especially in the desktop view.
3. Specifically in mobile, participants had a difficult time finding the 'profile menu', and in general were confused about the mobile navigation.
4. Users expect to see their benefit information on their profile. 
5. Users were unsure what email address was represented in the Personal and Contact Information section (contact vs log-in).
6. Users easily found connected apps and understood what it was, but there was some confusion about how to connect apps.
7. Users liked the 'name-tag' area, but the military badge is taking up too much space in the mobile view.

## Details of Findings

**1. People easily found what they were looking for within the new profile. Consequently, most participants preferred the new profile to the old one.** 
4/5 participants preferred the overall layout of the new profile, specifically calling out the new side nav design. Many thought the old layout seemed too information dense and difficult to navigate. As far as wayfinding, all participants stated that finding the pages they needed in the new design was 'easy'. All participants were able to locate the profile page from the home page on both mobile and desktop, though they used a variety of methods (Sign-in, My VA, Menu, Records).  
 > “You can go through and see most relevant info. It seems pretty intuitive. Once you are here. That something a lot of the VA profile did not have in the past, it was more utilitarian and was not intuitive, not a lot of thought process put into it. This makes it user friendly.”
 
 > "You know, looking at the older site, like I said it just seemed like there was a lot more going on, which can be confusing for...I was going to say for like older Veterans, but I guess for everyone really."
 
 > "I like it! I can see it being very useful, it gets you all the information you're looking for.  There might be a small learning curve, but that's with everything.  There are many apps that make it much harder to find information."
 
 > "It's too much information on this page (old profile). The pseudo-tab view is a better implementation."
 
 > " It’s a lot more user friendly than many other VA stuff. Usually it’s a form and submit and it’s a long drawn out process..."
 
**2. The side nav increased scanability of the overall profile, especially in the desktop view.** All users were able to quickly scan and locate the pages they were looking for using the side menu. All participants were able to understand the terminology used in the page links.  Even with 'Connected Apps' added in, all page links were visible, giving the user a clear overview of what was available to them. It can be assumed that adding in new page links to the navigation would still be consistent with these findings and would support the capacity for the design to scale.

 > "...the other version (new profile) to me is much better, it’s less convoluted, less confusing. You don’t have to scroll down...on this one you have to scroll down for days just to get to where you want to go. I like the setup."
 
 > "Well, I like the menu that pops up there. It's got all your information you can see that you can click on it and go to a different area. It's highlighted with the blue and the menu item you select is highlighted there. So it gives you a kind of visual direction for where you are going. Nice simple and “X” to get out."

**3. Specifically in mobile, participants had a difficult time finding the 'profile menu', and in general were confused about the mobile navigation.**
Most participants looked elsewhere (i.e. Menu, 'Kim') to navigate through the profile and had a difficult time finding the profile menu. Most commonly people looked for their name for navigation, stating that it was something they were familiar with and had used in other apps. Furthermore, participants seemed confused about the difference in functionality between Menu, 'User Name' Menu, and 'Profile Menu'.
 > “...my only complaint is the profile menu did not stand out...”
 
 > "I was just thinking my info, I did not think of profile menu. I have never… I don’t know. I would click on my name and my info would be there or my name would be there?"
 
 > "I kept clicking under the name and I didn’t pay attention to the bar. Which actually says profile menu. I automatically went to the name… but like I said profile menu is right there, so once I saw that I was able to navigate from there."
 
 > "Let’s see... the only thing that they have is my 'go to' ...it's to go to my name for the profile menu..."
 
 > "I know for me it was an oversight on my part because my mind automatically went to looking for my name, but it’s right… there. I mean. It could be a different color, or it could be capitalized, but other than that, you have this blue bar right there, I just missed it… probably because I was scrolling up real fast and my mind was on checking under my name."
 
 If users couldn't find what they were looking for in any of the menus on mobile, they would give up and go to the search bar.
 > "Like I said, if there’s something I’m not sure of or know exactly where to find it, search bar is there."
 
 > "I can’t actually click anywhere. But I would click out and try to find it in one of the search tool boxes..."

**4. Users expect to see their benefit information on their profile.** 
All users mentioned that they would expect to see benefit information in their profile. Some mentioned they would expect to see it in their 'Personal and contact information', some expected it to be its own page within the profile. There was a range of things mentioned, including the following:
- Current benefits available/used
- Education options
- Current disability
- Disability rating
- Current treatments
- Types of discharge (honorable/dishonorable etc.)
> "The only other thing I would say is possibility benefit information. And again, that might include education options, your disability stuff I don’t know, or go to a menu that link to those things. If I was coming to this and scrolling through it would be nice to have it all in one spot."

> "The only other thing I would add is what types of discharge, honorable/dishonorable because it does effect what type of VA benefits you get."

> "Maybe in addition to the direct deposit and the connect apps and the personal information if there was something like benefits you are currently using, currently receiving...benefits you are currently using. Because chances are if I am logging on to VA.gov, it has to do with one of the benefits I am using."
 
**5. Users were unsure what email address was represented in the Personal and Contact Information section (contact vs log-in).** 
All participants expected the email address shown in 'Personal and contact information' represented the email address used to log-in. Participants didn't notice the 'more information' drop down, and even after reading the 'More Information' content, there was confusion about updating the contact email vs the log-in email.  Users also expected log-in information to live in Account security.

> "I just didn’t notice it. But I would imagine that changing your email address would change your DS and ID."

> "I will just say for me personally that I didn’t realize that changing your email address wouldn’t automatically update the email that you use to sign in to VA.gov..."

> "I guess, are you saying it is not under the email address…That’s not the one I logged in with?"

Users expected the log-in information to live under 'Account Security'.
> "Under account security 2 factor, and personal contact email that I would prefer the login piece here (in account security) so you could update your login at least. That may be the only other thing to add here."

> "(In account security) I would expect to see either a phone number or email address you can edit - I think I use a phone number as my two factor. I would expect to see that is the factor they are using the correct either phone number or email address."

**6. Users easily found connected apps and understood what it was, but there was some confusion about how to connect apps.**
Even though 4/5 users had never connected an app, users still understood the terminology used and easily found the pages. They expected connected apps to live in their profile, and easily found the FAQ link.  All participants found the 'Apps you can use' link, but there was still some confusion about how to connect an app. (Clarifier: Before a user can disconnect a third-party app, they have to connect it, but this can only be done via the app itself. Our test participants did not have this context.)
> "Well, because it’s third party access, they need to to connected in first place. Umm, so I would imagine you both connect and disconnect in the same place." 

> "It's intuitive. It’s similar to other apps I use for uhm, like Drop Box per-say, where I have other apps that have access to it. Where I can have access to verify who has access to it and I can block them or allow it. It’s good.”

No users read the 'app disconnected' confirmation message, but after reading they were not concerned that information might still be saved after disconnecting.
> "No, but that’s because I didn’t read everything thoroughly. It says, “they won’t have access to new information but will still have access to information previously shared. Remove any stored data. Connect Apple Healthkit and request permanent deletion.” So, to answer your question, no, it was not, permanently."

**7. Users liked the 'name-tag' area, but the military badge is taking up too much space in the mobile view.** Overall, participants had a very positive response to the 'name-tag' area of the design, they liked the simple nod to their service.  Users often thought the military badge was a nice addition, but that it was taking up too much valuable space in mobile view, making it difficult to see important information.
> "The emblem could be smaller. We can pretty much recognize our service emblem. It's not critical to this spot and doesn't need to be so big."

> I like, I really like coming in and seeing my service Army there. It’s a nice little feeling, like a reminder and a way to feel connected."

> "I like it. (laughs) honestly I do. It kind of reminds you who you are. I like it. I mean...it says ok this is what branch... this is who you are, this is the branch you served under. It’s simple, it’s a simple identifier. It kind of looks cool."

## Additional Insights
- All users preferred desktop to mobile.
- 4/5 participants preferred the new side nav design to the old profile design.
- All users easily understood what content was editable.
- In-context FAQ's were noticed and utilized throughout the sessions - with exception to the email address FAQ.
- Once users found the 'profile menu' they were able to find and use it again easily.
- The side nav design increases ease of scanability in profile.
- In-line editing was clear and easy to use and utilized space nicely.

## Recommendations
- Make mobile subnavigation clearer for the logged in experience - this is possibly a two-tier solution. First, there should be a short term fix specific to the profile, followed by a more involved long term solution based on previous research and more comprehensive mobile navigation needs.
- Add clarification around email address in Personal and Contact information and add email address to Account Security.
- Further investigate what benefit information we should add to the profile.
- Remove/shrink military badge in 'nametag' in mobile view.

## Next Steps
### Mobile Navigation
- Discover what research (if any) has been done around current mobile navigation/subnavigation
- Put together markdown document or deck with proposals for current solution and future solutions (keeping logged-in homepage in mind)

### Benefits
- Further explore the placement of benefit information in the logged-in homepage discovery

### Universal Design Updates
- Create mocks for proposed email address changes

### Mobile Specific Design Updates
- Create mocks for proposed nametag view
- Create mocks for Mobile subnavigation
