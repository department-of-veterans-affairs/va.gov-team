# Analytics needs for Profile 2.0

## What we have now

Currently, we have profile analytics in a few of places:

- [Old personalization 1.0 dashboard](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/1MEhg3-5vnPBsSc_1wCzh6LByR3RjH92q/page/OoJS?s=vS-iovB_OEo)
- [Profile submission data](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/report/content-event-events/a50123418w177519031p176188361/explorer-segmentExplorer.segmentId=analytics.eventAction&explorer-table.plotKeys=%5B%5D&explorer-table.rowStart=0&explorer-table.rowCount=25&_r.drilldown=analytics.eventLabel:profile-transaction/)
- [Direct deposit dashboard](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/?authuser=0#/dashboard/T7daIpzoRw2LOg1BVHJ0Dw/a50123418w177519031p187673796/)
- [Address validation dashboard](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/?authuser=0#/dashboard/arWBC7_-SkK3WHQuJQHQoQ/a50123418w177519031p176188361/)

## What need

We need some general stats on profile views/behavior at a high level, and then we need to add or consolidate some other analytics into one or more dashboards. We likely already have tracking for most of the analytics we want and just need to get those stats into a consolidated dashboard(s).

- High level profile stats
- A dashboard for of the following:
  - Contact information
  - (Maybe) A small update to the address validation dashboard
  - A small update to the direct deposit dashboard
  - Account security
  - Connected apps

### High level stats

These are based on our [high-level project OKRs & KPIS](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/Combine%20Profile%20and%20Account/README.md#okrs--kpis). This includes:

- Total profile visits
- Number of clicks on each link in the profile navigation
  - Personal and contact information
  - Military information
  - Direct deposit
  - Account settings
  - Connected accounts
- Time spent on profile
- Stats around the next page viewed following profile (maybe top 5, then link to detailed view)

### Contact information dashboard

We are likely capturing this email in analytics already, but I would love to have this info in a consolidated dashboard so it's easier to track than it is now. I would like to see:

#### Mailing address
 
- Successful form submissions (Already have on the address validation dashboard)
- Failed form submissions (Already have on the address validation dashboard)

#### Home address

- Successful form submissions (Already have on the address validation dashboard)
- Failed form submissions (Already have on the address validation dashboard)

#### Home phone number

- Successful form submissions 
- Failed form submissions

#### Mobile phone number

- Successful form submissions 
- Failed form submissions
- How many people have opted into health care appointment reminders ("Send me text message (SMS) reminders for my VA health care appointments" checkbox)

#### Work phone number

- Successful form submissions 
- Failed form submissions

#### Fax phone number

- Successful form submissions 
- Failed form submissions

#### Email address

- Successful form submissions 
- Failed form submissions

### Address validation dashboard

- Would it be possible to click into the data on this dashboard so we could see full reports?
- Otherwise, we're good to go.

### Direct deposit dashboard

- Would need to add tracking for the "View payment history" link. 
- Otherwise, we're good to go.

### Account security

- Clicks of Verify your identity
- Clicks of Set up 2-factor authentication
- Clicks of Go to the terms and conditions for health tools
- Clicks of "Go to VA.gov FAQ"

### Connected apps

- How many users have apps connected
- How many users disconnect apps from here
- Clicks of "Go to connected accounts FAQ"
- Clicks of "Full list of possible applications"
