# Military Emblem Approval

### As of 10.6.20, the autheticated experience team has received official approval from DoD to use the military emblems and logos in the "name tag" (in the profile and future homepage) on VA.gov.

### Background

On 9.30.20, our team found out that we needed military approval in order to use the emblems/logos on the VA.gov profile. Lauren Alexanderson connected me (Samara) to Adrien Creecy-Starks <adrien.f.creecy-starks.civ@mail.mil>, and I sent an email explaining how we wanted to use the insignia.

### Helpful to know

There is apparently a difference between **seals, emblems, and logos**.

- **Seals** - This is official military insignia for each department. Seals say "Department of X" around the outer edge. Groups outside the departments are not allowed to use official seals.
- **Emblems** - These are circular insignia for each branch, but they don't say "Department of X." Outside groups are allowed to use these with permission.
- **Logos** - These are the standard logos you see for each department on marketing material. Outside groups are allowed to use these with permission.

Ms. Strauss,
 
There is a difference between emblems, seals, and symbols/logos. The general rule of thumb is if the graphic reads “Department of the Army,” etc., then it is for official use by the respective department. You can find more information at the following link:
https://www.defense.gov/Resources/Trademarks/DOD-Trademark-Licensing-Guide/
 
Ms. Starks reached out to the liaison at each service component before she went on leave. I have just received each component’s response. The consensus is that while the seals are for official use only, the services are granting permission for you to use the service emblems or logos. The U.S. Space Force does not currently have an emblem, so using the USSF logo is permissible.
 
Please let me know if you have any additional questions.

Hi Ms. Creecy-Starks and SSG Behringer,
 
Thank you so much for your help. My apologies if I was using incorrect language; I didn’t know there was a difference between official seals and service emblems/symbols, but now I do. Thank you for the clarification!
 
Please let me know what next steps are and if you have questions or need any materials from me. I’m happy to work with you in whatever way I can to keep this moving.
 
Also, please feel free to call me Samara.
 
Thanks!
Samara

Hi Ms. Strauss,
  Yes, my office is the right spot for coordinating use of multiple Military Service insignia.  Use of the official seals would not be permitted; however, the Service emblems or symbols may be appropriate.  Please allow SSG Behringer and I to coordinate with the Services to ensure we have consensus on what would be permissible.   Since I’ll be out all next week, SSG Behringer will be back in touch.
 
Thank you for contacting our office to ensure compliance on the VA.gov site.
 
Regards,

Hi Ms. Starks,
 
I got your name from my colleague, Lauren Alexanderson, who worked with you a couple years ago to get permission to use military seals/logos on the Veteran ID cards that were being created by the Department of Veterans Affairs at the time. She said you’d be the right person to contact about use of military seals/logos on VA.gov.
 
What we’re doing: I work on VA.gov, and I run a team that manages the VA.gov user profile and dashboard. Recently, we completed a redesign of the VA.gov user profile, and as part of that, we thought it would be a great idea to show a Veteran their branch’s military seal in the profile. Since we require all users to login and verify their identity before viewing their profile, and since we can verify branches of service through VA backend system that connect to DoD’s DEERS database, we feel confident that we can accurately show military seals/logos and that this level of personalization will make Veterans feel proud and connected to their service.
 
I’ve included a screenshot of what this looks like for both a Veteran (has symbol) and non-Veteran (no symbol/logo) so you can more easily see what I’m describing. Please note the Veteran screenshot is all dummy data and not actual PII.
 
What we need: I didn’t realize until Lauren brought it to my attention that we need permission from DoD to show military seals/logos on VA.gov. I apologize sincerely that I was not aware of this policy and am willing to do whatever I need to do to make sure we have the adequate permissions to use the seals as described above. Can you let me know what we need to do to obtain permission? I want to make sure we are in compliance and working above board.
 
Please let me know what I can do to obtain official permission to use the seals/logos so that we aren’t in violation of any DoD policies. I’m happy to answer any questions you may have.
 
Samara
