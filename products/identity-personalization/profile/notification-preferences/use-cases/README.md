# Notification settings Use Cases
**Last updated:** January 9, 2024 - added use case for partial or missing contact info

For all of these use cases, the user must be LOA3 (identity verified). If the user is not LOA3, the only thing they can access in profile is the Account Security section.

## Common use cases
### User logs in with LOA1 account
- [User logs in with an LOA1 account](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/use-cases/loa1-user.md)

### User logs in with LOA3 account
#### User has contact info on file for existing notification channels
- [User needs to update setting for one or more notifications](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/notification-preferences/use-cases/update-settings.md)

	- This is only valid once we have multiple notification channels (e.g. text and email)
