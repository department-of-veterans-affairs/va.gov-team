# Notification settings: User wants to update notification settings

**Last updated: December 1, 2022**

LOA3 users who sign in, go to the profile, and click into the notification settings page will be able to opt in or out of notifications available to them.

## UX
* Users will see some notification preferences based on their benefits (e.g. health care preferences). Other notifications are available for all users (e.g. Appeals notifications).  
* We display the contact information where notifications will be sent at the top of the page, along with a link to update that information.
* Users can choose between “notify” or “don’t notify” for each notification.

* [Mobile mockup](https://www.sketch.com/s/afd69a1f-72d2-430b-9b62-285e9d3f479c/a/4a8b4xJ)

### Saving and editing notification settings
* The form is an auto-save form, so it doesn’t have an update or cancel button
* The [input message component](https://design.va.gov/components/form/input-message) displays a success or error message, depending on the outcome of the update
* A loading indicator displays while the setting is updated
