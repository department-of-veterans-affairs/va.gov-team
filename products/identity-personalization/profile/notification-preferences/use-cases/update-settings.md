# Notification settings: User wants to update notification settings

**Last updated:** February 15, 2024

LOA3 users who sign in, go to the profile, and click into the notification settings page will be able to opt in or out of notifications available to them.

## UX
* Users will see some notification preferences based on their benefits (e.g. health care preferences). Other notifications are available for all users (e.g. Appeals notifications).  
* We display the contact information where notifications will be sent at the top of the page, along with a link to update that information.
* Users can select or unselect a "notify me by [channel]" option for each notification.

### Saving and editing notification settings
* The form is an auto-save form, so it doesnâ€™t have an update or cancel button
* The [input message component](https://design.va.gov/components/form/input-message) displays a success or error message, depending on the outcome of the update
* A loading indicator displays while the setting is updated
* [Save state](https://www.figma.com/file/e6JEtrwZCInKk9SjZktx2T/Profile---Notification-Settings?type=design&node-id=0-34&mode=design&t=beICgF9Ke3eKxb6t-11)
* [Error state](https://www.figma.com/file/e6JEtrwZCInKk9SjZktx2T/Profile---Notification-Settings?type=design&node-id=0-2&mode=design&t=beICgF9Ke3eKxb6t-11)
