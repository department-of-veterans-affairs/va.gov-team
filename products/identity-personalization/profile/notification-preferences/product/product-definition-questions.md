# Product definition questions

## Answers to these questions are [documented here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/notifications/notification-preferences/meeting-notes/1.19.21_Chat%20with%20Terry%20and%20team.md).

These are for our initial feature definition meeting with Terry on 1.19.21.

- What data fields should we account for?
   - Groupings:
     - Who determines these groups? Are they pre-determined, or will they be added/defined over time and pulled in from the backend?
  - Notification type (eg. Health care appointment reminders; Prescription updates; COVID updates, etc)
  - Communication type:
    - Email, text, phone, mail, do not contact?
    - Are there MVP types (eg. email and text) we should account for now, while other types (eg. phone and mail) we should account for later?
- What data will be hard coded vs. what will be pulled in dynamically from VA Profile?
- How do we determine what groups/options to show for each user? 
- Who is defining each permission/preference?
  - Who is responsible for things like copy/content for each preference type? How can we assure that any copy/labels meet the VA.gov style guidelines?
- Besides VETText, do we have any known communications persmissions/notification preferences that are in the works or need to be ready soon?
- What is our MVP vs. what is a V2 or V3 feature? (Define together and make sure there is alignment)
