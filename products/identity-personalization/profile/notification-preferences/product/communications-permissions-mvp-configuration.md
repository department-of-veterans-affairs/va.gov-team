### Items NOT Included in MVP
| Communication Item | Group Name | Channels | For MVP | Description | Notes/Open questions|
|--------------------|------------|----------|---------|-------------|---------------------|
|COVID-19 updates | General VA updates and information | Email | No, as of 8/31/21 | COVID updates. Currently vaccine focused.  I imagine this could change based on what shifts w/ the pandemic. **Update as of 8/31** - this will not be included in MVP.  | Previously called “Keep me informed” |
|Reminders to finish in-progress applications| Applications, claims, decision reviews, and appeals|	Email/Text | ~Maybe?~	No | Sending Reminders (SMS, email) to Veterans with Save in Progress Applications| Assumption: content in emails/texts would be the same.                      **UPDATE**   As of 7/8, we determined with VA Notify that it's unlikely this would be ready/available for MVP |
| Debt Notifications | 	VBA - Debt Management |	Email	| No |  | Not including this since it’s a transactional message; something automatically sent from the call center|
| General Information and Updates |	VA - General | Email/text	| No |	 | Not including per Paras |
| Maybe a COVID-19 related text? | VA - General | Text | No |   | Not including per Paras |
| Health Care Appointment Reminder | Health Care - Appointments |	Mobile push	| No |   | Not including push notifications at this time|
| Scheduled payment updates |	Benefit payments and debts | Text	| ~Maybe?~ No | Text message notification to veterans or beneficiaries in regards  to expected payment arrival. | This is an email that the comp & pen team wants to send when someone is scheduled to receive a payment.   **UPDATE** As of 7/8, we determined with VA Notify that it's unlikely this would be ready/available for MVP  |
