# Profile notification preferences UAT conversation guide

### Project-specific setup

- Sign in to Zoom.
- We will be having users share their screens and testing the new notification preferences feature in profile. When the participant is ready, have them share their screen.
- When their screen is shared, send the link https://www.va.gov or have them go to www.va.gov. 
- **Note: We will not be recording these sessions**.

## Intro - 2 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Liz and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about the profile section of VA.gov. We've add a new notification settings feature to manage text and email notifications and we want to make sure that it is all working properly in your account.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take less than 30 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **If you have a mobile phone number in your profile, I'm going to ask you to remove it to test one part of our feature.** We can add it back at the end of the session.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** If you find something we show you to be confusing, we want to hear about it. Your feedback helps us to figure out how we can improve the Veteran experience, and we will not be offended by any opinions you express.
- **We will be able to see your real information today.** This may include some healthcare information and some claims information. During any of the tasks if you feel uncomfortable sharing your screen with any of your information on it, feel free to stop screensharing and start again when you feel comfortable. 
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 

## Warm-up/Screener Questions - 5 minutes

OK, let's get started.

1. First, can you tell me a little bit about yourself? (If stuck, prompt to ask about service experience, where they live, their work).
2. Can you confirm for me that you have a DS Logon, MyHealtheVet, or ID.me account? 

- If they do not know what that means, ask: Do you ever sign into any va websites, such as VA.gov or ebenefits, to access or apply for your benefits? (If yes: Can you talk me through how you do that?) 

3. Do you know your username and password? 
   - If not: Are these readily accessible? Could get them?
   - If the user can not remember or retrieve their login credentials, **end the session.**
4. What type of mobile device you are using today? 
   - If needed: I'm asking this question because sometimes the type of device can affect your experience with the tools. Knowing which one you are using will help our developers make adjustments if needed.
5. Can you tell me which web browser you are using? 
6. Do you currently receive health care through the VA?
   - If no: have you ever?
   - Have you ever received care at a VA medical facility in Asheville, NC, or Denver, CO? 
7. Since this new feature is related to notifications, I'm curious to know what notifications you currently get from VA.
   - Do you receive those via text or email?
8. Today we are going to observe you interacting with the new tools on your computer. Would you feel comfortable sharing your screen with me at this time?  
   - If no: Explain this is necessary for testing. If they are still unwilling, **end the call.**

**Screenshare**

OK, please share your screen, and then we will get started.

I'd like you to open a new tab in your browser, and go to https://www.va.gov/.
