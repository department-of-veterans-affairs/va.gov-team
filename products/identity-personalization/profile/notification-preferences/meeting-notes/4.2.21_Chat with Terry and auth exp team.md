# 4.2.21 Chat with Terry

## Topics and questions

- Saving by groups: Lihan raised the issues that the API works in a way that notifications need to be saved individually, yet the team strongly prefers Liz's design that allows users to edit/save notifications by groups. Is this technically possible in a way that's not super annoying? Terry seems optimistic, but we should talk about this as a team.
- Question from Liz: We want to confirm all notifications will always have a group. Based on one of our recent convos, we got the impression that those were more theoretical and business lines aren't going to kick things off with groupings. What should we expect?
