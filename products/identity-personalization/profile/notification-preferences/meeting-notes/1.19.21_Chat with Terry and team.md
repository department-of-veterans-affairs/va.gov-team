# Product definition chat

**In attendance**: Terry Bazemore, Karisa Strickland, Maria Harmon, Matt Shea, Samara Strauss.

## Data types & fields: What data fields should we account for?

The two calls we make to VA Profile before showing options to the customer are **selection options** and **communications permissions**. 

### Selection option: Groupings

#### Group types

- Product line groups (MVP)
- Campaign groups (More likely a V2 or later feature)

#### Who determines these groups? 

- Conceptually, the product line owner will define product groups. VEO may define groups for campaigns.
- Items can appear in a product line group or a VEO group as part of a campaign (eg. a campaign for a specific status notification — VEO could group all financial notifications into a group).

#### Are these hard coded or dynamically pulled in from VA Profile?

- These are dynamically pulled in from VA Profile. They come over when we pull over the selection options.

### Selection option: Communication items (eg. health care appointment reminders; prescription updates, etc.) 

#### Are there MVP notification types we should account for in V1 (eg. VETText — health appointment reminders; VANotify)?

- VETText – health appointment reminders; appeals reminders (currently storing that but not Veteran facing)
- VANotify – FAS payment notification; 526 process
  - This is in the mock data right now.

#### Are these hard coded or dynamically pulled in from VA Profile?

- These are dynamically pulled in from VA Profile. They come over when we pull over the selection options.

### Selection option: Communication channel (Eg. email and text)

#### Are there MVP types (eg. email and text) we should account for now, while other types (eg. phone and mail) we should account for later?

- Initially, we should account for email and text.
- Voicemail (phone) will likely not be part of initial build, but we should account for it since it may be added in the future.
- We do not need a mail indicator, since it is unlikely the VA will stop sending mail any time soon.
- No need for “do not contact”. This is reflected in the permission itself.

#### Are these hard coded or dynamically pulled in from VA Profile?

- These are dynamically pulled in from VA Profile. They come over when we pull over the selection options.

### Communication permission 

- This is the actual list of permission the person has selected on a specific item for a specific channel (eg. you can communicate with me for health care reminders via text).
- Effectively, a communication permission = communication item + communication channel.
- People can opt-in or opt out and change permissions at any time.

### Preferences

- A preference would be more specific information for a specific type of permission. This is likely something we will add in the future but is not part of the initial work. 
  - Eg. If I say it’s ok for you to contact me by phone for a notification or reminder, it would be my preference that you would use a hearing impaired device. 

## Governance

### Who is responsible for things like copy/content for each preference type? How can we assure that any copy/labels meet the VA.gov style guidelines?

VA Profile has a governance process and flows. There is a committee for communications permissions. They are not allowing communication partners to call an API and create an item/grouping/item & channel relationship. They have to submit a request and VA Profile can go back to them with questions. If this passes the process, then the request can be created as a ticket for implementation.

### Who is responsible for usability testing?

This, in theory, should be done by the product line owner for the communication item.

**We should continue the conversation with VA Profile about this to make sure that we can maintain content, IA, and usability integrity.**
