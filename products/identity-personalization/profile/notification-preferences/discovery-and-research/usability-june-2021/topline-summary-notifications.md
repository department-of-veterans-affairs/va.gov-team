This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.

**The goal of this document is:**

* To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
* To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
* To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

## Perceived Findings

### It was not intuitive for participants to look in profile to manage notification settings.

- 7 of 8 participants did not go to the profile;
- they looked on the homepage under various sections such as health care and records.  
- When prompted many said they would use search and type in something about text messages or notifications.  

> Probably under health care. I would say under refill and track your prescriptions. or, I guess, the other thing I could do if I didn't find it there, I'd probably go up into the search block. - P3

> I might go up to the search function at the top of the page and type something in there to look for text messages or communications with the VA. - P9

- Most participants stated they would expect to find notification settings under My VA after seeing options in the personalized drop-down menu

> "I would probably go to My VA and hopefully have another drop down for whatever MY VA would be- might give options for text or options to update profile or whatever the case may be" - P6

### Participants clearly understood notification groupings, but had less confidence in notification names.

- All participants correctly understood the notification groups

- People seemed less sure about notification names and made comments that suggest their expectations don't align with what we're planning (need to dig into this)

  - Scheduled payments

    > Not sure what benefit payments and debts are here. Education benefits? - P16

  - Applications in progress (I think one participant misunderstood this)

  - Prescription shipment and tracking updates

    - People had a hard time associating this with the first task when we said "updates on your medications"
    - One participant thought they'd be able to update their shipping address here if it was incorrect
    - Another participant thought they'd see tracking numbers here

### A few participants prioritized health care notifications above all other groups.

- At least 2 participants wanted to see Your Health Care at the top of the page because they're most active with that benefit at the VA (need to validate this, may have only been 1 participant)

- At least 2 participants stated the applications, claims, etc group was irrelevant to them because they're all set with their benefits

  > "I already got my disability rating so I wouldn't need any applications or anything and since I have my rating, there is not need to appeal because I am at 100%. And do those two things...I would skip right by this box. " - p9

### Participants clearly understood they needed to add contact information before they can receive notifications through that channel.

100% of participants clearly understood the messaging throughout the notification settings page telling them they needed to provide missing contact information to get notifications there.

### Participants expected to be able to edit their contact information on the notification settings page, and experienced usability hurdles update their contact information on a separate page.

- Most people said they expected a pop-up would appear if they clicked an update contact info link
- Most people got confused and/or frustrated going back and forth between the two sections of profile
- Some people thought they completed the sign up process just by adding an email address

> (On personal and contact information page) "Your contact email address is showing, and that box is not empty.  I would assume it's done." - P3

- Other participants felt there was too much back and forth going between notification settings and the personal and contact information page.

> "To add stuff and change settings, there's a lot of clicking and having to hunt on the next page to where you want to go. So when you want to add your email address, you have to hunt and go down the page and see where you want to add your email address in." - P11

### Participants did not easily understand the distinction between their sign-in and contact email address.

- People got very confused by the ID.me copy in the Contact Email Address section of the contact information page.
- Some people were very hesitant to edit their contact email address because of the ID.me content
- Some people thought they had to leave VA.gov to add a contact email address

> "I was trying to see something about COVID, and I didn't see it but then I remembered I clicked on email. So, I guess I have to be verified. Now that's a lot of work. Y'all are going to make me go to another website." - P2

> It seems kind of dumb, if you just put it [email address] in there down below. It's kind of a conflict because it's saying you have to go there [[ID.me](http://id.me/)] to udpate your email address, but you've already got it down there. Maybe I'm missing a big point...If you're dealing with someone that has issues, mental, physical, this could really put a cog in the wheel - P6

### A few participants struggled to understand which notifications were turned on or off.

They didn't notice the copy telling them whether a notification was on or off until prompted.

> "Oh there you go! Notify by text. That's where you see it. It's so small though!" - P2

> I didn't really in the beginning, see the "off" there. I believe it was lower case letters, not bolded or anything. I would do something there to enhance that so my eye would go to it. Even this right here *reads "*notify by text, on" - I would do something more noticeable that would bring my eye to it. - P9

### Participants assumed all notifications would be available through email and text, and couldn't guess confidently as to why a notification may only be available through one channel.

- People didn't understand right away that some notifications were only available via one channel.
- Once prompted, it took them a while to process the information in the prototype telling them which channels were available.  Some participants still did not deduce that a notification was only available via one channel, even after reading copy.
- Those that did understand the available channels, weren't sure why some notifications would be only via text, and others only via email. They expected to be able to get notifications via the channel of their choosing.

> The VA just didn't make it an option on the website. I don't know why not. It seems like if they can do prescriptions and you get text or email option, you should probably get a text or email option on appointment reminder. - P11

> (After moderator explained some notifications were only text and some were only email) "That was not clear to me. I don't like that. If you are going to give me the option, give me the option, don't limit my options. " - P2
