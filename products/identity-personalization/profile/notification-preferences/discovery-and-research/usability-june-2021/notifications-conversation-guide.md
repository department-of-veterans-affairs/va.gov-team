## Intro - 2 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is ______ and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes.  We have a team working on a new section of the VA.gov profile that will help you manage email and text notifications from the VA. During our session today, I'd like to hear your thoughts about notifications, and get your feedback on this new section of the site.   

To make sure we're on the same page, when I say notifications,  I'm referring to text messages or emails you get that notify you about an update, an action you've taken, or something that needs your attention.  I want to make the distinction that we're not talking about mobile push notifications or reminders you get from an app - our conversation will be specific to notifications you get via email or through an SMS text message.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 30-45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, I want to hear your honest opinions.** I'm not testing your ability, and there are no right or wrong answers. Our team wants to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your honest feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype.** It may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. None of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Do you have any questions for me?**
- **I'd like to I record my screen and audio as we talk today, if that's alright with you.** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. Are you comfortable with me recording screen and audio for our session?
  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I've started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Warm-up Questions - 3 minutes

Before we look at the prototype, I'd like to talk to you about notifications.

- Tell me about any email or text notifications you've received recently.
  - NOTE TO MODERATORS: BE PREPARED TO EXPLAIN WHAT A NOTIFICATION IS. 
  - Did you choose to receive those notifications?
  - Can you tell me about a time you've needed to update settings for those notifications? 
    - Where do you go to manage them?
- What kinds of notifications do you currently get from VA? 
  - How do you receive them?
- What kinds of VA notifications would be helpful to you that you aren't currently getting? 
  - Where would you expect to find out about them?

### Things to watch for

- Where/how do people go to manage notifications (in their profile, exclusively via the channel itself)?
- At what point do they manage notifications? 
- What words do people use to talk about or search for notification content?
- How do people find out about new notifications?
- What VA notifications are they not getting that they wish they did?

## Task 1: Navigate to notification settings - 2 minutes

Now we'll move into the prototype. I'm going to send you a link through the chat function, and then have you share your screen.

*Send link to prototype, starts on homepage*:

- Link for participants 1-4: https://preview.uxpin.com/5ecec4de6ec34eddc9f095677a881be3646124ce#/pages/139049739/simulate/no-panels?mode=i

- Link for participants 5-8: https://preview.uxpin.com/21c45602ef100852a3c63654bb8f5ad809487c5d#/pages/139696473/simulate/no-panels?mode=i

If any pop-ups from Zoom are blocking your view of the prototype, go ahead and close them.

I'm going to give you a scenario to explore the prototype. Please think out loud as much as possible as you go through the prototype. Imagine you receive text messages from the VA, and you've logged into the website. You no longer want to receive text messages from the VA.  How would you do that?

*If needed, send link to personal and contact information section of profile, see if they can find notification settings from there*: 

- Link for participants 1-4: https://preview.uxpin.com/5ecec4de6ec34eddc9f095677a881be3646124ce#/pages/139106944/simulate/no-panels?mode=i
- Link for participants 5-8: https://preview.uxpin.com/21c45602ef100852a3c63654bb8f5ad809487c5d#/pages/139696479/simulate/no-panels?mode=i

### Things to watch for

- How did the participant expect to be able to navigate to notification settings?
- How easily was the participant able to find notification settings?

## Task 2: General impression - 5 minutes

*Participant should be on notification settings page of profile.* 

- Link for participants 1-4: https://preview.uxpin.com/5ecec4de6ec34eddc9f095677a881be3646124ce#/pages/139049744/simulate/no-panels?mode=i
- Link for participants 5-8:  https://preview.uxpin.com/21c45602ef100852a3c63654bb8f5ad809487c5d#/pages/139696478/simulate/no-panels?mode=i

Thank you. Please don't click on anything just yet. Take a look at this page and talk me through what you see here.

- What can you do on this page?
- What notifications are you currently signed up for? 
  - Prod at notification groups if they haven't already mentioned it: What types of things will you be notified about? 
- Based on what you see here, how are you getting notifications for scheduled payments?
- Where will VA send you notifications, based on what you see here? 
  - What would you do if that was an old phone number?
  - *If participant says they would click, understand if they expect to edit on this page, or be taken to another page*. *Try to keep them on notification settings page*: What would you expect to happen if you clicked on that?
  - What do you think about seeing that information *(where notifications will be sent)* there?
- What is your impression of the way the page is organized?


### Things to watch for

- Is it helpful for people to see the contact information where notifications will be sent?
- Do people understand the notification names and groupings? 
- Is the preview text (e.g. `On: emails, text`) meaningful and helpful?
- Is the treatment of partial contact information confusing to anyone?
- Do people expect to be able to edit their contact information right here on this page?

## Task 3: Update and save settings for an existing channel - 5 minutes

1. Thank you, all of that is really helpful for our team.  Now, imagine you want to set yourself up notifications about the delivery of your medications. How you would do that? Continue to talk out loud and share what you're thinking.
2. **If needed, when in edit mode:** While you're here making this change, I'd like to pause and ask you a couple of questions.
   - You got here by clicking edit - is that what you expected?
   - How are you able to receive the notifications you see here? Why do you think that is?
   - How would you get text messages for appointment reminders?
3. *After saving:* Now that you've made some changes, take a look at the screen. Is this what you expected?

### Things to watch for

- Does our "edit per group" pattern introduce any usability hurdles?
- Do people understand that `checked` = notifications on and `unchecked` = notifications off?
- Are the checkbox labels sufficiently explicit?
- Did the participant understand the copy explaining that a notification was only available via email?
- Did the participant get confused as to why some notifications have 2 channels and others have one?
- Did the "If you'd like to receive email notifications..." copy make sense to the participant?

## Task 4: Update contact information and sign up for email notifications - 8 minutes

Imagine that COVID updates are really important to you.  Show me how you'd go about setting that up so you could get that notification.

If needed, prompt user to go back to notification settings to complete sign up task after adding their email address:

- At this point, are you signed up for COVID updates? 
  - If yes - how do you know?
  - If no - how would you do that from here?

Now that you've added an email address to your profile, talk me through what you see on this notifications page.


### Things to watch for

- Was the participant confused by the missing edit button for the email-only notification group?
- How did the participant become aware that they were missing contact information?
- Did they expect to be able to edit their contact information right here on this page?
- Which link did they click on to navigate to the personal/contact information section of the site from notifications (alert link, link inside notification group, side nav, etc)?
- Did they get frustrated that they were not able to edit contact info right in the page?
- Were they able to get back to notification settings without any major hurdles?
- Did they notice that places that previously said "add your email address" are now replaced with a status?

## Task 5: Remove personal information - 2 minutes

Now I'd like you to imagine you changed your mind, and don't want the VA to email notifications to you again. How would you remove the email address you added?

Now that you’ve removed your email, what do you expect to happen with your notifications?

### Things to watch for

- Did the participant make any comments about the edit / remove buttons?
- Did the participant experience any confusion removing their contact information?
- What does the participant expect to happen if they've opted into notifications but then remove contact information?

## Post-Task Interview - 4 minutes

- Tell me how that overall experience aligns with your expectations for managing notifications.
- What notifications would you expect to see here that you didn't?
- Any questions for me? 

## Thank-You and closing - 1 minute

Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Great, thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
