## Problem Statement

Currently, the existing notification preferences we support all happen to only use text message as their means for getting in touch with users. However, we know that we'll soon need to support notifications that use email as a channel, and maybe some that support both text message and email as options. We want to do some research around how we can incorporate this additional option into the notification preferences interface so that we're ready to move quickly once this becomes a need for both users and stakeholders.

## Research goals

1. Determine usable and scalable approach for adding email as a channel.
2. Determine usable and scalable approach for adding more notification preferences to the page.
3. Determine what level of information people need in order for them to decide whether they want to edit/update their preferences.

## Research questions

1. How do we clearly differentiate between email and text? Is copy enough?
2. How do we balance text and email when they both exist as a channel for one notification?
3. How do we keep the page usable and scannable as we add more notifications with more channels?
4. What level of information do people need in order for them to decide whether they want to edit/update their preferences?
