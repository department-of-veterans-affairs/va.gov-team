## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Liz and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them... 

Today we’d like to get your feedback about a webpage that lets you manage settings for notifications you receive from VA.

Before we start, I want to confirm a few pieces of information that were shared with me when you signed up for the study:
- Can you confirm that you have used My HealtheVet within the last 12 months? **End the session if they have not used My HealtheVet recently or are totally unfamiliar. It’s probably ok if it’s been within the last few years.**
- What kind of email or text notifications have you received from VA in the last 12 months?
- **For screenreader sessions:** I understand you use screenreader software to navigate the internet, and that you typically use SOFTWARE NAME.  Can you confirm you’ll be using that in today’s session?

Thank you for confirming these things! Now, I have a few things about today I want to go over with you:

- **This entire session should take about 30-45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I want to be sure before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - If yes: Admit observers. 
    - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)
   - Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## First Task: Review first prototype  - 5 minutes / 10 minutes with assistive tech
Great! Let’s go ahead and get started looking at the prototype. I’m going to have you share your screen.

*Provide guidance on screen sharing if needed*

Now, I’m going to send you a link to a prototype in the chat, and I’d like to get your feedback on it:
	- **Facilitator: Alternate which prototype you start with**
		- If starting with read/edit mode, use this link: [https://codepen.io/surfbird/full/PoBpwzO](https://codepen.io/surfbird/full/PoBpwzO)
		- If starting with autosave mode, use this link: [https://codepen.io/surfbird/full/gOjmPyj](https://codepen.io/surfbird/full/gOjmPyj)
	 
Talk to me about what you can do here. Don’t click on anything just yet, please.
- What questions come up for you as you look at this page?
- **If needed:** is anything confusing or unclear?
- Show me how you would update your notifications settings from this page.
- How do you feel about the amount of information you have for each notification? 
- Do you need any other information in order to make a decision about updating a notification setting?

### Things to watch for:
- Does the participant understand the different notification items, and channels available to them?
- What questions does the participant have about the notifications?
- Is anything confusing to them?
- **For autosave**: What comments do they make about the lack of a save button?
- What is their reaction to the level of information presented?

## Second Task: Add email address - 3 minutes / 6 minutes with assistive tech
Wonderful, thanks for sharing all of that with me. 
- Show me what you would do if you wanted to get notifications by email. As a reminder, this is a prototype, so it won’t work quite as you expect. But we’ll still be able to learn from you.
- What questions are coming up for you as you go through this?
-  **If needed:** is anything confusing or unclear?

### Things to watch for:
- Does the participant understand they need to add an email address before they can get notifications by email?
- Do they understand that some notifications are available by email, some by text, and some by both?
- What questions does the participant have about this?

## Third Task: Review prototype B - 5 minutes / 10 minutes with assistive tech
Thanks for doing that, it’s so helpful for us to be able to hear your thoughts on that.  Now I’d like to get your feedback on a different approach, and I’ll send you a new link through the chat.

	- Facilitator: Share prototype link you did not use before	
	- If second prototype is read/edit mode, use this link: [https://codepen.io/surfbird/full/dyjvybr](https://codepen.io/surfbird/full/dyjvybr)
	- If second prototype is autosave, use this link: [https://codepen.io/surfbird/full/vYaxzMW](https://codepen.io/surfbird/full/vYaxzMW)

Take a look at this page.  What do you notice that is different from the other view we looked at?

- What questions come up for you as you review this?
- **If needed:** is anything confusing or unclear?
- Show me how you would update your notification settings with this approach.
-  How do you feel about the level of information you have for each notification on this version of the page? 
- Do you need any other information in order to make a decision about updating a notification setting?

### Things to watch for
- What questions do they ask? 
- What is their reaction to the level of information presented?
- **For autosave**: What comments do they make about the lack of a save button?

## Post-Task Interview - up to 10 minutes
That’s everything I wanted to review with you- thank you so much for your feedback. 
- We reviewed two different ways to update notification settings today. Does one approach work better for you than the other?
- Do you have any other thoughts you’d like to share that you haven’t had a chance to talk about yet?
- Any questions for me?

### Things to watch for:
- What is the participant’s reaction to this approach, vs the first one?

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes
Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit
In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.
