## Overview

While most of the MyHealtheVet migration into VA.gov will take place in the health care "apartment", universal information, like the MyHealtheVet profile and settings, will move into the VA.gov profile. After completing [an audit of the MyHealtheVet profile and personal information sections](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/mhv-profile-research/recommendations.md), we learned that most of the information that exists in the MHV profile already exists in the VA.gov profile. However, MHV notification preferences are not yet supported by VA.gov, and are an essential piece of functionality that needs to move in to VA.gov. This engagement covers definition, collaboration with MHV, VA Profile, and VA Notify, and the build in VA.gov that will support the MHV notification preferences.

### Problems we'll tackle

**What notification preferences do we need to migrate**

We know we need to migrate the existing MHV preferences, but MHV has also mentioned other notifications they want to add in the near future. We will need to make sure each notification is defined so we can determine the right time to build a preference and/or to integrate the actual notifications through VANotify. 

**[ANS]** We're migrating 4 notification types - all email based: 

- Health appointment reminders
- Prescription shipping notifications
- New secure message notifications
- Notifications when medical images you requested are available

[See the relevant Epic](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/61102)


**Do we need to migrate all notification preferences at once, or can we take a gradual approach?**

As mentioned above, there are a handful of existing and new notifications/preferences that MHV are interested in having VA Profile and VANotify support. However, we will need to prioritize what gets integrated into VA Profile and VANotify and when based on the health apartment roadmap (notifications and preferences should be supported by the time a feature is supported on VA.gov), and MHV's long-term plan for their own profile.

**[ANS]** Initially we thought all of the notifications would be turned on at once, however it became clear each of the above mentioned notification types would migrate on its own timeline. We created feature toggles specific to each notification type 

- profile_show_mhv_notification_settings_email_appointment_reminders
- profile_show_mhv_notification_settings_email_rx_shippment
- profile_show_mhv_notification_settings_new_secure_messaging
- profile_show_mhv_notification_settings_medical_images

**Do we need to migrate existing notification preference data from MHV to VA Profile? If so, is this possible?**

Given that we are working with existing notifications for which people have existing preferences saved, we'll need to talk to VA Profile about whether a data migration is possible or not.

**[ANS]** A call in May 2023 this was discussed, MHV data isn't supposed to leave MHV without explicit approval of the veteran/user. Some data will be backfilled however. 

**When do we need to integrate the actual notifications with VANotify?**

Technically, we can support notification preferences independently of where the notifications are coming from. VA Profile supports preferences both for notifications supported by VANotify, and those that are supported by other VA systems. If and when we integrate notifications with VANotify depends on the health apartment roadmap and when features need to be fully supported on VA.gov.

**[ANS]** There is nothing AE Profile team needs to do here. 

**When and how will we integrate Cerner data?**

A huge piece of the entire apartment is integrating Cerner data, and notification preferences are no different. We will need to work closely with the health apartment team to figure out how to reconcile MHV and Cerner data for users who may go to one facility that uses Cerner and one that uses VistA. We hypothesize that it may be easier to integrate MHV data first, and then later figure out how to reconcile Cerner data.

**[ANS]** [this will happen independently, Oracle Health (OH) (formerly Cerner) will have it's own migration timeline and efforts](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/91245)

**Do the VA.gov profile and the MyHealtheVet profile need to support the same notification preferences at the same time?**

Figuring out whether or not the VA.gov preferences can or should coexist with the MHV preferences affects how we approach things on the MHV end of things. If MHV wants our profiles or given preferences to coexist, they'll be in a position where they have to integrate with VA Profile. If not, we would want to make sure we had a coordinated approach where we turn off the MHV preference when we turn on the VA.gov preference.

**[ANS]** They have decided this is needed and are integrating w/VA Profile

## Problem Statement

- As a VA health care recipient, I want to choose how the VA communicates with me about difference aspects of my health care.

## User outcomes

### Desired User Outcomes

- Users can easily find and update their health care notification settings within the VA.gov profile, both before the health apartment is complete, and after.

### Undesired User Outcomes

- Users are confused about where to manage their health care settings while the MHV and VA.gov profiles coexist.
- Users have a difficult time signing in to VA.gov to change their notification settings before MHV is retired.

## Business outcomes

### Desired Business Outcomes

- VA.gov supports the existing MHV notification preferences, and some new ones, as part of this engagement.
- There is a clear path to guide users to the VA.gov profile once this functionality is supported on VA.gov.

### Undesired Business Outcomes

- (For VA.gov) We are put in a position to support a bunch of new settings that aren't actually ready to be supported.
- Users are confused about where to manage their health care settings while the MHV and VA.gov profiles coexist.

## Measuring success

OKRs and KPIs TBD.

## Solution approach

**Discovery - Spring 2022**

- Liz conducted a comparative analysis of the VA.gov and MHV profiles, assessed the MHV "Personal Information" section, conducted stakeholder interviews to assess expectations and needs, and conducted user research.
- [Initial MHV profile discovery research findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/Research/2022-05-MHV-profile-research)

**Definition, scoping, and planning - Fall 2022**

- We are engaging biweekly with the MHV team in order to define their notifications and notification preferences. This includes both existing notifications and notifications they are planning to add.
- Once we have a clear definition of what they have and what they would like to add, we will regroup with the health apartment team (eg. Lauren, Coulton, etc) to talk about a roadmap for these notifications & preferences. We hypothesize that we'll move over and incorporate notifications and preferences as related features (eg. secure messaging) are integrated into VA.gov.
- We will also talk to the health apartment about a migration strategy, and whether or not we think MHV should integrate with VA Profile, or we should simply retire notification preferences on MHV when we turn them on on VA.gov.

**Migration phase one: Get preferences into VA Profile; Connect MHV to the VA Profile backend - First half of 2023**

- [Initial migration plan notes shared with MHV (December 2022)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/notification-preferences/mhv-notification-preferences-migration/product/migration-plan.md)
- In phase on of the migration, we will work with VA Profile to support the MHV notification preferences. Then, MHV has agreed to connect their frontend to the VA Profile backend. This will allow us to have significant flexibility in when we incorporate preferences into the VA.gov interface.

**Initiative - Appoitnment reminders - Grant Permission to include PHI/PII**
[Initiative Brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/notification-preferences/mhv-notification-preferences-migration/appointmentReminderPHIandPII/initiative-brief-appointmentReminderPHIandPII.md)
- Currently, MHV has an option where Veterans can indicate whether or not it's ok to include PHI/PII in their appointment reminder notifications. We need to incorporate this preference into our notification settings UI.

**Migration phase two: VA.gov pulls in MHV preferences from VA Profile**

- Once preferences are supported in VA Profile, and MHV has connected to VA Profile, we can incorporate preferences into VA.gov any time. We'll need to figure out if we want to do this one-by-one in correspondence with the health apartment features moving into VA.gov, or if we want to support all preferences at once.

**Migration phase three: Move MHV notifications over to VANotify platform**

- This may happen concurrently with other parts of the process, but it is not necessary that it happen as preferences are built and supported. Preference work can still happen while the actual notifications are moved into the VANotify platform.
