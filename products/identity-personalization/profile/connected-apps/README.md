- [The frontend for this feature is currently managed by the VA.gov profile team](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/README.md#roles).
- The backend for this feature is maintained by the Lighthouse team, with POs being Dave Mazik and Carey Otto. They can be reached in Slack via [#vaapi-connected-apps](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/vaapi-connected-apps).

## Overview

The Connected apps section of the VA.gov profile allows users to view which third-party applications they have granted access to their VA, and it allows them to remove access to their data for any of the third-party apps they've previously connected.

[This is the list of apps that people can currently connect to their VA.gov data and manage from Connected apps](https://staging.va.gov/resources/find-apps-you-can-use/).

## User Problem Statement

As a user I need to:

- View which third-party apps have access to my VA data.
- Remove access to my VA data for third-party apps.
