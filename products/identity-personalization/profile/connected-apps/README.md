## Overview

The Connected apps section of the VA.gov profile allows users to view which third-party applications they have granted access to their VA, and it allows them to remove access to their data for any of the third-party apps they've previously connected.

[This is the list of apps that people can currently connect to their VA.gov data and manage from Connected apps](https://staging.va.gov/resources/find-apps-you-can-use/).

## User Problem Statement
