# Address Management Veteran Feedback

## Methodology

We interviewed eight veterans; six men and two women. Six receive mail order prescriptions and use myHealtheVet to manage those prescriptions. All had changed their address with the VA at some time, though for some it had been several years since they last updated their information.

- Male, 45- 54, Uses mail order prescriptions and address change
- Male, 25 - 34, Uses mail order prescriptions and address change
- Male 65 -74, Uses mail order prescriptions and address change
- Female, 55 - 64, Uses mail order prescriptions and address change
- Male, 55 - 64, Used to change address
- Female, Uses mail order prescriptions
- Male 65 - 74, Used to change address

## Summary

Veterans have built manual processes to manage their addresses at the VA. In part this is due to a disparate awareness of new functionalities, such as the ability to update an address on VA.gov that is shared with an increasing proportion of the VA enterprise. Address management is seen as a necessary  evil to participation in VA benefit programs. Simultaneously, veterans desire a more modern approach that is flexible and trustworthy. Most veterans prefer address management modalities with a human touch, as it gives them a sense of reliability and security. This is important to veterans because they recognize that having up to date address and contact information is directly tied to their ability to receive benefits from the VA. 

## Results

### Who

The veterans we spoke to managed their own addresses. One person had a dependent who was receiving education benefits, so he managed her address updates as well. 

Based on our interviews and previous open-source research, veterans identified several groups of VA employees that they know are able to update their address:

- Pharmacists
- Doctors/practitioners
- Clerks/medical admin 
- Receptionists
- VSOs

### What

Veterans provide the VA with their mailing and/or residential address, billing address (if different), home and/or cell or work phone number, and email. For those that are receiving or have dependents receiving education benefits, they also provide a payment address (if different from their other addresses and receiving education benefits). Those receiving care in the community have provided the VA with a non-VA pharmacy address. 

In general, veterans feel that it is very important for the VA to have up to date contact information, so that they or their family can receive VA benefits, and also be made aware of any benefit changes. In their perception, the contact information that they give to VA is what you would give to a civilian doctor or service provider.

> “All the info I put in --  next of kin, notification, and all that --  it’s fine with me. I would want the VA to have that for a lot of reasons. I don’t think there’s any contact info that I’ve given them that isn’t at least potentially necessary.”

> “It’s important to have our current address up to date so they can number one, reach out to us with letters to make sure we’re aware of any changes that may be coming to VA, increase in benefits, pay raises, and the like.”

### Why

Participants cited medical benefits as the primary use of their address within the VA. This includes mailed prescriptions, identity verification at appointment check-ins, medication recall alerts, and appointment reminders. Of these, appointment reminders were the only use participants take issue with; the folks we talk to feel that mail reminders are redundant and annoying, and wish they received only email reminders instead.

> “Paper mail from the UPS is usually a backup to info on MHV. I don’t think I’ve gotten anything by mail that I didn’t already see on the website.”

> “[Address is used for] Mainly VA medical information, an upcoming visit. They’ll do it online, they’ll do it by text, and then I get a letter also! So I’m well-informed.” 

While address is less commonly used for non-medical benefits among our interviewees, veterans understand that an accurate address is important for eligibility requirements and important claim-related correspondence. Apart from benefit-related mailings, folks noted that the VA used their addresses for VA correspondence like publications and mailings.

Participants emphasized the overall importance of the VA’s responsibility to keep track of veterans in order to deliver on their mission:

> “I think it’s important that the VA maintain contact with every veteran, because that’s what they’re there for: supporting veterans.”

### How

Veterans are aware that there are several modalities to update an address. Seven of our eight interviewees were not aware that they could update their address via their profile on VA.gov. One interviewee had tried to update his address on VA.gov a few years back after searching online and finding out that was an option, but was unable to find where to do it on his profile. He ultimately went into the VA in person to make the address change.

Our interviewees use four avenues to update or change their address information: online via myHealtheVet (MHV) or eBenefits, in person at a VA facility or pharmacy, or via phone calls to the VA 1800 national call line. 

Open source research shows that veterans are aware they need to call in to multiple places to change their information. Some specific business lines that veterans are aware of are Eligibility and Enrollment, Education, and the Debt Management Center. Veterans will also utilize local VA facilities and VSOs to make address changes. Some will verify an address with external parties, like the DEERS system, in addition to making changes with VA systems. 

MHV seems to be a key access point for veterans to verify and update their addresses, particularly for those that receive health benefits and prescriptions. Veterans are able to verify their address on MHV when filling a prescription, which is a key point of interaction. Those not receiving health benefits seem to use eBenefits more heavily to verify addresses and payment information. 

In either case, veterans will use MHV and eBenefits to update addresses, but expect a manual process of verifying that the address change went through when done online. Veterans mentioned they will often use online VA resources, including VA.gov, to find address change forms and then physically send in those forms via snail mail. They then follow up on those physical letters by calling in to the VA or checking for address changes online. The manual process that veterans go through to track and verify an address change went through underscores the importance they place on the VA having an updated address for them, and hints at a lack of trust that all the systems the VA has will get their address update. as one veteran remarked when it came to their address update, “I didn’t want to take any chances so I went in person.” 

> “My first shot would be on the internet, the website, probably MHV. Then my fallback is when I go down to the VA anyways, escalate [it in person]. I would try to go and change it [online], but I don’t want to goof up my correct address!”

Overall, there’s a lack of clarity on whether an address change online translates across the VA or not. 

> “I would go to the eBenefit page. I honestly don’t know if I’m supposed to be doing it from there or the VA.gov. I don’t even know if they merged, truthfully. That would be something I would have to verify.”

We saw this echoed in our open source research, where extensive online forum-based communities of care have developed to help other veterans navigate what they perceive to be a confusing and laborious process. 

> “I gave up on MHV except for prescription reorder and secure messaging - I'm never sure what information gets where, so I make changes to my "account" in person... at least I know I tried to update stuff.”

> “I called the VA yesterday to update my address because I moved to an entirely different region. Well, that was more a hassle than it should have been. After giving them all my info they require more info for address changes. This extra info includes your date of entrance to service or date of separation, your compensation percentage, and your compensation amount to the penny...Oh that was just for benefits, I still have to call for the medical side, and the GI bill side because those are separate systems!”

For those that regularly use VA facilities in person for medical care or prescriptions, they tend to use medical personnel as points of address verification. In the experience of our interviewees, medical clerks, doctors, and pharmacists all go through the veteran’s record and verify that their address is up to date. Veterans have also used their kiosk check-ins, especially when using a VHIC card, to verify that any prior address change went through and that their address on file is current.

### Systems

While several of the veterans we spoke with mentioned using VA.gov, none had updated their address on the site and, when prompted, were unaware that that was an option. Most participants had used MyHealtheVet and eBenefits, and indicated that, in their experience, neither website allows them to update their address online across the VA. Several had success using their VHIC card, kiosk updates at VA facilities, and calling the VA call center to make changes. Most folks seem to prioritize the “human” touch points to update their address by visiting a facility in person or calling in to make address changes.

By and large, the most common “system” that folks rely on is communities of care and peer education. Some participants work or volunteer with other veterans, particularly older communities, to help them navigate the byzantine VA system and make the changes they need. Others rely on the knowledge and guidance of friends and online communities to understand how to make updates. Online communities like Facebook groups and the Reddit forum r/Veterans are common resources when official VA assistance is scant, confusing, or unreliable. 

### Challenges

The primary pain points that surfaced in the interviews we conducted were the manual nature of the process, the distributed and disjointed nature of the system, and outdated technology.

Many of the veterans we spoke with were resigned to the manual process, indicating that they are accustomed to being proactive and persistent with VA updates.

> “It’s not like one-stop shopping. You have to go through processes. But I guess I’ve been doing it long enough that I kind of know my way around.”

Expectations for service are already low, so some veterans are more prepared to “do the legwork” to receive benefits, and even the folks who had run into issues with updates often said their experience was smooth and they were lucky, relative to the horror stories they’ve seen and heard from other veterans. Others decide the fight is not worth it and abandon VA providers or give up altogether on taking advantage of the benefits they’ve earned.

> “I have, that’s part of the reason why I switched to community-based providers….the prescription mail was always such a pain, I mean just utter clown shoes.”

Several participants spoke of the disconnect between system silos while trying to update their contact information. One man explained that when he moved from one VA facility to another, years of his records seemed to be lost.

> “When we moved from Colorado to Pennsylvania [in 2018], the last record they had of me being seen at any VA was in 2012, which would have been when we moved from Pennsylvania to Ohio the first go-round. They had nothing at all. I went to Patient Information; the lady who was working there, she kind of had to do some digging to find everything and I guess maybe transfer it over, connect it, whatever needed to be done.”

He considered this outcome a success because it did not take him long to get it corrected; however he acknowledged that if he had not happened to have a checkup and discover the issue it could have caused major problems. This disconnect between VA facilities, as well as across systems (for example, updates in MyHealtheVet not reflecting in veterans’ health records, and the proliferation of multiple VA- associated websites) is frustrating to users, especially as they don’t have transparency of what parts of the VA don’t connect or why. 

The folks we spoke with considered the whole system to be antiquated and technologically outdated. They long for a more streamlined process like they’re used to in the private sector. 

> “I think our technology’s not caught up on this, on the VA change of address. There’s an easier way to do this.”

The inability to consistently change their address online (most participants were unaware of this option on VA.gov) as well as confusion about the mail-in address update process causes frustration. As one veteran put it, “This is just too hard.”

### Risks

Like Pharmacy SMEs themselves, veterans understand the high risk of mis-mailed prescriptions. One person we spoke with had a controlled substance send to the wrong address:

> “The pharmacy system is I guess separate from other systems, I don’t know how the backend works on that. But the rationale that I was given was ‘your address didn’t update in the pharmacy system’. So I actually had a controlled substance mailed to my previous address in another state. So that was, that was far from ideal. That kind of defeats the purpose; it’s not really a controlled substance if it’s mailed to an address I no longer live at.”

Participants were also highly aware of the impact missed mail can have on claims processing. Several folks expressed concern that they could miss important mailings if their address was not updated correctly, and this could cause their claims to be delayed for months or years.

> “If you had a claim pending, and the outcome of that claim comes back, if you don’t get it and you’re supposed to sign off on certain paperwork and send it back to them, you’re not going to get your claim. It’s not going to be processed.”

Some participants also expressed concern about security risks of allowing online updates, despite the fact that they actively pushed for more digitization. While the need for a streamlined, modern, consolidated online experience is a universal desire, veterans are wary of the VA’s history of security breaches.

> “If you’re allowing people to change their information online, who’s to know that it’s actually the person that’s actually changing the address?”

### Ideal World

Echoing what we’ve heard from lines of business, the veterans we spoke with championed modernization and consolidation. Many participants asked for the ability to change their address online (again signalling a lack of awareness about that option on VA.gov), as well as an increase in email notifications instead of mailings, or control over their communication preferences.

> “The online option would be nice. And the options to either select or unselect electronic billing and those kinds of things.”

The folks we talked to who had attempted to change their address online mentioned MyHealtheVet and eBenefits. Their experience with MHV indicated that an online address update would not be reflected in their health record, and their experience with eBenefits indicated that they needed to send in paper forms. No one we spoke with remembered successfully changing their address online through VA.gov, and when prompted almost all participants were unaware that that was an option.

Many participants also spoke of the need for a consolidated system or “one-stop shop” for updates, including digital receipts for the updates made in order to distinguish between user error and system issues.

> “I would like it to be that there’s a one-stop shop website where you could go in, verify your information, make sure all your pertinent stuff is there, that would have: name, address, maybe a line that says ‘online prescription refills’. And if you click that it’ll list your address and you can edit that if it’s incorrect. ... And that way it’s kind of a one-and-done, it’s submitted. I would like it if there was a confirmation email sent after the fact. I say that because that way if the address isn’t changed, when I do go to get it fixed I can print a copy of that email out and give it to someone and be like, ‘Look, this date, this time, here’s a confirmation that I went in, changed it, it’s something with y’all’s system, I didn’t fat-finger my address or anything, it’s something with the computer system.’”

In general, the veterans we spoke with wanted more concrete indicators that updates they make are successful, whether those updates are done online, in-person, or by mail.

> “I’d like to know when they’ve received something so I’m not just wondering if they received it, which generates another phone call.”

## Conclusion and Recommendations

Our research demonstrates two gaps in the veteran experience of address management - little awareness of online address change options, and desire for a consolidated and trustworthy address change process.

Almost universally, veterans used “attended workflows”, seeking out medical personnel, call center reps, and VA employees to manage an address update. While most were familiar with the ability to change addresses on MHV or eBenefits, none were aware of that capability on VA.gov. From previous research and projects, we know that some veterans are aware of this functionality, so more education and campaigns could be effective tools to increase veteran awareness and adoption of VA.gov Profile. 

There is interest in a consolidated, online process -  a “one-stop-shop” where veterans could make an address change and control what each address or contact information is used for. The desire for a trustworthy process is clear - folks want to know that an address change went through and that they have done their due diligence in the process. This is directly related to their preference to use update processes that involve a human, be it in person or via a phone call, as that feels more trustworthy. 

> “I usually have to call them to get that confirmation. Again, being a baby boomer, I usually don’t trust the answer I get unless I physically call and talk to somebody and say ‘did you receive my form, did you annotate the changes to my form, and is my daughter covered for the next scholastic year?’. I’m a telephone guy, although I will go online and provide them what they need, because they do need things that are online.”

Based on this research, we recommend:

- Awareness campaigns to inform veterans and beneficiaries about the address change functionality on VA Profile
- Alongside this, institute “trust-building” measures on VA Profile. For example, once an address change is done on VA Profile, provide email confirmation or similar “receipt” 
- Explore consolidating any address change functionality to VA.gov profile.
  - i.e. MHV address changes either turned off or relegated solely to a “pharmacy address”
