# Contact information: address not recognized as entered
**Last updated: November 10, 2022**

If a user changes their address from the VA.gov profile and that address isn’t recognized by the U.S. Postal Service (USPS), they’ll be provided with a suggestion or an option to:
- use the address as entered
- return to editing
- cancel the edit

[Product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/contact-information/address-validation/README.md)

**Note for upcoming iterations:** After observing users scrolling away from the address validation alert without realizing they had triggered it, we explored a flow that follows the [sub-task pattern](https://design.va.gov/patterns/help-users-to/complete-a-sub-task). [Here's a prototype](https://preview.uxpin.com/72a4060dec9250e4385a9abfaeefec42b3994e00#/pages/159609187/simulate/sitemap?mode=i) showing that state, as well as a simplified header and footer.  The team decided to hold off on moving forward with this due to the current contract status. When we decide to move forward, we'll need to learn more about the simplified header and footer, as well as have our page reviewed by content. The intention is that this page would be showin on the `/profile/edit` URL. Github issue [#48537](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/48537) has more background in the comments.

## UX
For each scenario, the user is presented with a [warning alert component](https://design.va.gov/components/alert#warning-alert) that appears within the address field, above the address they entered. 

We’re aware of accessibility issues with the current implementation, and [proposed improvements back in Q4 2021](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/contact-information/address-validation/designs/2021-alert-updates/README.md). These haven’t yet been implemented due to the overlapping [address change messaging modal feature](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/contact-information/address-change-messaging/use-cases), since that could create a user flow where many modals appear back to back.
