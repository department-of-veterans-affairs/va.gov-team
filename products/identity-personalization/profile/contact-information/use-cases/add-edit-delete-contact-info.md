# Contact information: User needs to add or update contact information
**Last updated:** September 7, 2023

- If a user doesn’t have contact information on file, they’ll see a prompt to add missing information within the relevant section.  
- They can use the “Edit” button to add or update their contact information in edit mode. This applies to:
	- Mailing address
	- Home address
	- Home phone
	- Work phone
	- Mobile phone
	- Contact email address
- Once they’ve added information, they can use the “Remove” button to delete the information on **any section *except* mailing address**.

## UX
### Adding information
- For each section with a `null` value, the user will see the name of the section and prompt that tells them they can edit their profile to add [section information].
- Clicking the edit button will put the section into edit mode and reveal the necessary fields.
- Review the work phone section in [this mock-up](https://www.sketch.com/s/59857eb5-d9f9-4145-99d3-d9a1de2d0655/a/098x48j) to see prompt to add missing information

### Editing information
Clicking the edit button will put the section into edit mode and reveal the necessary fields.

### Saving information
- Changes are saved once the user presses the “update” button
- Once the form is successfully saved, the user is returned to “read” mode and a background-only success alert should display above the edit button

- [Mobile mock-up, save success](https://www.sketch.com/s/59857eb5-d9f9-4145-99d3-d9a1de2d0655/a/oYO1LOj)

### Save error: information can’t be saved
* If we can’t write to the backend for any reason, a generic error message is displayed above the update button. ([Mock-up](https://www.sketch.com/s/59857eb5-d9f9-4145-99d3-d9a1de2d0655/a/kavrLvD))
* If the save continues to fail, the user is returned to read mode with an error displayed in the section they attempted to edit. ([Mock-up](https://www.sketch.com/s/59857eb5-d9f9-4145-99d3-d9a1de2d0655/a/EL7DyKd))

### Removing information
- Clicking the remove button will trigger a modal prompting the user to confirm they want to remove their information

### Canceling changes
* If a user has made changes to any form field, and hits cancel, they’ll first see the field validation message. This is a limitation of the form system.
* If they hit cancel a second time, or hit cancel before editing any fields they’ll be presented with a modal asking them to confirm they want to leave edit mode.
* Once they cancel, they’ll be returned to read mode.
