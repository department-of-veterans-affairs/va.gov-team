## Current experience
- When mail is sent to a Veteran and then returned to the VA, the address is flagged as “bad” in VA Profile. When a user’s address has this flag, they will be prompted to review and update their Mailing address on the Contact information page in VA.gov Profile.
- Mailing address must be kept updated as it may be where Veterans receive VA bills, notices, and prescriptions.
- The Mailing address inputs follow the same rules as all others, including when saving, removing, and system and validation errors.
