# Contact information: Mailing address is flagged as “bad” in VA profile
**Last updated:** October 26, 2023

When mail is sent to a Veteran and then returned to the VA, the address is flagged as “bad” in VA Profile. When a user’s address has this flag, they will be prompted to review and update their mailing address on the personal information and contact information pages in profile. Mailing address must be kept updated as it may be where Veterans receive VA bills, notices, and prescriptions.
