## Overview

When mail is sent to a veteran and then returned to the VA, the address is marked as "bad" in VA Profile. The address may very well be a real, valid address, but the returned mail implies that it is no longer the right address for the veteran for whom the mail was intended. Currently, 300K veterans have the bad address indicator flag on their mailing address in VA Profile.

## Problem Statement

- As a veteran, I want the VA to be able to reach my at my current mailing address.
- As a veteran, if the VA does not have my current address, I want them to reach out to me and let me know.

## User outcomes

### Desired User Outcomes

- Users will realize that the VA does not have a good address for them and update their information.

### Undesired User Outcomes

- User update their home address without updating their mailing address.

## Business outcomes

### Desired Business Outcomes

- Reduction in returned mail.
- Increase in veterans updating their addresess.
- Reduction in users who have the bad address indicator flag in VA Profile.

### Undesired Business Outcomes

- We can't proactively reach out to people who have the BAI.
- No reduction in users with the bad address indicator flag.
- No reduction in returned mail.

## Measuring success

#### Objective #1: Reduce returned mail at the VA

Note: We will not have access to metrics on returned mail.

**Key Result #1** -- Decrease the number of users in VA Profile who have addresses that are marked as bad by 25%.

|KPI/metric|Baseline|Post-launch #1| Post-launch #2|
|----------|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
|Number of addresses with the bad address indicator| ?|?|?|

**Key Result #2** -- Increase the number of amailing ddresses updated per week by 25% from baseline for four weeks in a row.

|KPI/metric|Baseline|Post-launch #1| Post-launch #2|
|----------|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
|Number of mailing address updates|?|?|?|
