# P10

This participant was a beginning screen reader user and required an accessibility specialist's assistance to use their software during the session. Even with this assistance, they were unable to reach the tasks due to difficulty signing in and navigating the homepage to find their profile. They spent the entire session, along with 35 additional minutes, trying to do so.
