Intro - 3 minutes
-----------------

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Christina, I also have a note taker and another member of the website team with me. Today we're going to talk about a new feature we're adding to VA.gov to help Veterans update incorrect contact information. The purpose of our session today is to make sure the feature is working as expected in your account and that you're able to interact with it as intended.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

-   **I also have some other colleagues in the waiting room who would like to observe and take notes.** Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I wanted to be sure before we get going. Are you okay with letting them in for this session?
	- _If participant does not consent, ask the observers to kindly leave the Zoom via Slack._
	- _If participant consents, let other observers into room and allow a short pause to say hello._ Here are some other members from our website team - if you'd all like to say a quick hello. And now for those of you who just joined, if you could please turn off your cameras to save bandwidth, the would be great.

-   **This entire session should take about 45 minutes or less**. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

-   **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions**. If you find something to be confusing, we want to hear about it. Your feedback helps us figure out how we can improve the Veteran experience, and we will not be offended by any opinions you express. We're testing our work, not you, so you can't do or say anything wrong here.

-   **We will be able to see some of your real information today**. During any of the tasks if you feel uncomfortable sharing your screen with any of your information on it, feel free to stop screensharing and start again when you feel comfortable.

-   **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know**.

-   **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

	-   _If yes:_ Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

_Start recording._

-   **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 2 minutes
----------------------------------------

_Confirm they qualify for the study._

-   As part of the scheduling for this session, we asked if you have an identity verified account on VA.gov. According to the information I received, you do have an identity verified account. Is that correct?
-   Can you confirm for me that you have a DS Logon, MyHealtheVet, Login.gov or ID.me account?
	-   _If they do not know what that means, ask:_ Do you ever sign into any VA websites, such as VA.gov, My HealtheVet, or ebenefits, to access or apply for your benefits?
		-   _If no:_ I'm not sure we can proceed if that's the case. Have you ever had to enter a username and password to access your VA benefits online or anything like that?
			-   _If still no, end the session:_ Without that account access, we won't be able to test this feature with you today, so I'm going to end the session. Thank you so much for your willingness to participate.
-   Do you know your username and password?
	-   _If not:_ Are these readily accessible? Could you get them?
	-   _If the user can not remember or retrieve their login credentials, end the session:_ Without login credentials, we aren't able to test this feature with you today so I'm going to end the call. Thank you so much for your willingness to participate; it is greatly appreciated.

**If using production:**

-   OK, go ahead and open a new tab in your browser, and go to <https://www.va.gov/>. _Send link to va.gov via chat if needed_
-   And go ahead and log in.
- Great, now that you're logged in, could you please share your screen?
	- _If needed:_ You can do that by clicking the green button on the bottom of the Zoom window that says "Share Screen." It will then ask you which window you'd like to share and you can share either just your web browser where you'll be looking at the page we're testing or your entire desktop/background.
	- _If no, explain this is necessary for testing. If they are still unwilling, end the call._ I completely understand. However if you're not comfortable sharing your screen for the session, we aren't able to test this feature with you today so I'm going to end the call. Thank you so much for your willingness to participate; it is greatly appreciated.

## Background Questions - 2 minutes

**Once logged in to VA.gov:** 
-   Ok, so now that you're logged in and I can see your screen, I have a few initial questions for you.
-   How often do you go to your Profile?
-   What are the reasons you generally visit your Profile?
-   Let's pretend you received an email that some of your information was incorrect and so you decide to visit your Profile. Without selecting anything, could you tell me what you would do next?
	-   What would you be searching for?


Task #1: Review Personal information page and alert - 3 minutes

-   Go ahead and do that / navigate there. (Go ahead and walk me through that.)
-   Talk me through what you just did.
	-   _If needed, ask:_ Did you notice the link in the alert? Why did you decide not to select that?
	-   Was there anything unclear about that?

_At this point, if the participant continues on through the edit or confirm flow once on the Contact information page, allow them to continue and then ask follow up questions afterwards._

		-   If needed: When did you notice the alert (gray box with the yellow stripe)?

Task #4: Update Mailing address - 5 minutes
-------------------------------------------

**Task goal: Make sure the participant can easily UPDATE their mailing address.**

-   Now I'm going to ask you to imagine that you're reviewing your mailing address and your zip code is incorrect like the alert says. Could you walk me through how you would update that?
	-   _If needed, ask:_
		-   I saw you hesitated at [action], why was that?

-   Now I'm going to ask you to show me something slightly different.
-   First, could you please open a new window in your browser and go to VA.gov again? This will reinstate the alerts so we can review them again.
-   Thank you! And go ahead and navigate to your Profile once again.
-   Ok, great. Now I'd like you to imagine that you came to this page and found the same alerts, but when you checked your mailing address you didn't find any errors - everything was correct. In this scenario, could you demonstrate how you would go about telling VA your address is correct?
	-   _If needed, ask:_
		-   I saw you hesitated at [action], why was that?
		-   What kind of information are you searching for?
		-   Why did you expect it to be there?

## Reset Address and Post Task Interview - 2 minutes
-   _If using production:_
	-   Ok great, that is just about everything I wanted to get your feedback on.
	-   Lastly, I'd like to make sure that we now have all of your correct information, since we made one small change to your zip code. Could you please take a moment to double check your zip code?
	-   Does everything seem correct here?
-   Great! That's everything I wanted to get your feedback on. Do you have any questions or thoughts for me on what we've reviewed?

## Thank-You and Closing - 1 minutes

Great, thank you so much. This has been really helpful for our team, and we appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

- Before we end this session, I have three additional questions for you about the study setup. I’ll ask the observers to leave the session at this time.
- _wait for observers to leave_
- Would you say that you were mostly nervous or mostly comfortable with having observers in this session?
- Sometimes we have the additional observers already in the session when you join, instead of how we did it today. When I asked you for consent before the observers joined this session, did you appreciate that, or did you feel that was mostly unnecessary?
- Thinking about the brief introductions with the observers, did that make you more feel at ease with them listening in, or did it feel more awkward?

Great, thank you for your feedback and thank you so much again for joining us today. We really appreciate it.

Have a great rest of your day!
