Intro - 3 minutes
-----------------

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Christina, and I also have a note taker with me. Today we're going to talk about a new feature we're adding to VA.gov to help Veterans update incorrect contact information. The purpose of our session today is to make sure the feature is working as expected in your account and that you're able to interact with it as intended.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

-   **There are a couple of members from the website team who would like to observe the session and hear your feedback live**. Are you comfortable with them joining the session? No pressure either way.

-   **This entire session should take about 30 minutes**. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

-   **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions**. If you find something we show you to be confusing, we want to hear about it. Your feedback helps us figure out how we can improve the Veteran experience, and we will not be offended by any opinions you express. We're testing our work, not you, so you can't do or say anything wrong here.

-   **We will be able to see some of your real information today**. During any of the tasks if you feel uncomfortable sharing your screen with any of your information on it, feel free to stop screensharing and start again when you feel comfortable.

-   **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know**.

-   **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** I will stop the recording while you are logging into the site so we don't record your personal information. We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

	-   _If yes:_ Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

_Start recording._

-   **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 3 minutes
----------------------------------------

_Confirm they qualify for the study._

-   As part of the scheduling for this session, we asked if you have an identity verified account on VA.gov. According to the information I received, you do have an identity verified account. Is that correct?
-   Can you confirm for me that you have a DS Logon, MyHealtheVet, Login.gov or ID.me account?
	-   _If they do not know what that means, ask:_ Do you ever sign into any VA websites, such as VA.gov, My HealtheVet, or ebenefits, to access or apply for your benefits?
		-   _If no:_ I'm not sure we can proceed if that's the case. Have you ever had to enter a username and password to access your VA benefits online or anything like that?
			-   _If still no, end the session:_ Without that account access, we won't be able to test this feature with you today, so I'm going to end the session. Thank you so much for your willingness to participate.
-   Do you know your username and password?
	-   _If not:_ Are these readily accessible? Could you get them?
	-   _If the user can not remember or retrieve their login credentials, end the session:_ Without login credentials, we aren't able to test this feature with you today so I'm going to end the call. Thank you so much for your willingness to participate; it is greatly appreciated.
-   Ok, so today we're going to observe you interacting with the new feature. Would you feel comfortable sharing your screen with me at this time? You can do that by clicking the green button on the bottom of the Zoom window that says "Share Screen." It will then ask you which window you'd like to share and you can share either just your web browser where you'll be looking at the page we're testing or your entire desktop/background.
	-   _If no, explain this is necessary for testing. If they are still unwilling, end the call._ I completely understand. However if you're not comfortable sharing your screen for the session, we aren't able to test this feature with you today so I'm going to end the call. Thank you so much for your willingness to participate; it is greatly appreciated.
-   Great! Thanks for confirming all of that. Please share your screen and then we will get started.
