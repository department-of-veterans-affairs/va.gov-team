Research Goals and Questions
============================

### 1. Validate that our proposed alert method successfully prompts Veterans to update their mailing address
-   Do users notice the alerts?
-   How urgent do Veterans consider the alerts?
-   Are users inclined to ignore or follow the alerts? 

### 2. Validate that our alerts are easy to understand
-   Can users understand the instructions included in the alerts?
-   Do users understand how to update their address vs. confirm their address?

### 3. Validate that Veterans can easily update or confirm their Mailing address by following these alerts
-   Can users easily navigate to the Contact information page from the Personal information page using the alert link?
-   Can users easily navigate to the Mailing address from the top of the Contact information page using the jump link?
-   Can users easily locate the smaller alert within the Mailing address field?

### Outcome

We'll use the findings from this research to update our alert content and inform our MVP designs.

Methodology
===========

We conducted remote usability testing over Zoom using a prototype on production. This allowed us to use a code-based prototype and be more inclusive with our recruitment approach. 

Hypothesis and Conclusions
==========================

-   Veterans will easily locate the main alerts
	-   LIKELY TRUE
-   Veterans will use the alert links to reach the Mailing address field without difficulty
	-   DEFINITELY TRUE
-   Veterans may have difficulty understanding the alert instructions
	-   LIKELY TRUE
-   Veterans may have difficulty understanding how to update their address vs. how to confirm their address
	-   LIKELY TRUE
-   We believe the design for the alerts will be effective at drawing attention to important information
	-   DEFINITELY TRUE

Key Findings
============
1.  7/10 participants quickly noticed and understood the Personal information page alert.
2.  6/10 participants did NOT notice the Contact information page main alert or found the contents unclear.
3.  The majority of participants considered the alerts urgent.
4.  Participants understood how to correct an error in their mailing address.
5.  Most participants (7/10) had trouble understanding how to confirm an already-correct address.
6.  A few participants expressed concerns around the current process used to confirm an address.
7.  Participants had a positive response to the new observer method used for the study.
8.  A few participants had suggestions for miscellaneous changes on the Contact information page.

Details of Findings
===================

### #1: 7/10 participants quickly noticed and understood the Personal information page alert.

 > "That is new. I did notice that and haven't seen it before." - P3

 > "I do like that it popped up right away" - P8

 > “No I didn’t [notice the alert]” - P9

### #2: 6/10 participants did NOT notice the Contact information page main alert or found the contents unclear.

Some participants did not seem to notice or read the second alert, with a few stating the second alert was the same as the first one. Participants who read the alert often did not fully read the contents, reading only the first part and then jumping to the last part ("..select Update to confirm."). Participants paid more attention to the smaller yellow alert on the Contact information page.

 > "With all of the other pages with banners like this for Covid and flood warnings never apply to me so I just don't look at these." - P9, referring to the gray alert with a yellow stripe used on MyHealtheVet pages as well as elsewhere on va.gov

 > "That big "review your address" is standing out." - P7, referring to the smaller all-yellow alert

4/10 participants found the wording unclear in the Contact information page main alert and did not understand what "Update" meant in the context of confirming an address. Many conveyed they felt there should be something that directly said "confirm."

 > "And then here it says '...if it's correct, select Update.' It shouldn't be Update. I'm not updating anything, I'm just confirming it's correct. Updating is changing." - P1

 > "And it says after you do anything - if it's already correct or if you've done anything, select Update. And I don't see an Update button." - P2

 > "There's no confirm button, and edit tells me to change it." - P9

### #3: The majority of participants considered the alerts urgent.

5/9 considered the alerts urgent, while 2/9 considered them somewhat urgent. 1 participant considered the alerts optional and not very urgent.

_Note: this question was missed for P5_

 > "It's pretty important, especially as far as I know there shouldn't be an issue with my address. So I would check it right away." - P7

 > "Considering I get prescriptions and appointment cards in the mail it is important to me that the contact information for mailing is correct." - P8

 > "It's not really important. Important would be something bigger and red, not yellow." - P1

### #4: Participants understood how to correct an error in their mailing address.

All participants quickly identified how to correct their information. Some did this without looking at the instructions.

 > "Very straightforward." - P3

 > "Self-explanatory." - P2

 > "If my info wasn't correct, I would click 'Edit' and click 'Update'. If my zip code wasn't correct, I would put in the new zip code and click 'Update'. I would hope the alerts would go away." - P5

 > "It was very streamline. I still like working from my laptop for things like this. So, especially with it being mobile, I'd say it's very user friendly and everything reads very well as well." - P8

### #5: Most participants (7/10) had trouble understanding how to confirm an already-correct address.

5/10 Veterans said they would ignore the alerts and not do anything if they couldn't figure out how to confirm that their address was correct.

 > "I wouldn't do anything I would skip it. I would assume people don't know what they are doing. It tells me to review but not telling me how to." "Then I would scroll on down to make sure it is good. I wouldn't do anything because there's no way to confirm it." - P9

 > "There isn't anything for me to do. There isn't anywhere I can 'Confirm'. I wouldn't click on 'Edit' because I don't have anything to edit. Since it's correct, I won't do anything." - P1

2 participants thought looking at the address or selecting cancel (after selecting edit) if their mailing address was already correct would fulfill the request.

 > "I would guess it's saying 'Review your address' alert will show up only one time I'm visiting this page." "I would log out and go back in to confirm the alert went away." - P5

 > "Hitting cancel is fulfilling my obligation to the page." -P4

A few of these participants were able to figure out how to confirm, but only after further prompting.

 > "I guess I hit update even though I'm not updating anything. That's odd. Seems more like a confirmation than an update." - P6

### #6: A few participants expressed concerns around the current process used to confirm an address.

A few participants were concerned that by confirming their address via Update, a change may have inadvertently been made to their already correct address somewhere in the background.

 > "Sometimes when I see update when I'm only confirming things then I kind of get a little, not paranoid, but I do security, IT security, myself and I would just think that's odd. Did somebody make a change I didn't know about?" - P6

 > “I am not comfortable doing that because I have a history of it going wrong with the va. I don’t want to click edit and mess it up or click update because it is already good.” - P9

### #7: Participants had a positive response to the new observer method used for the study.

All participants felt comfortable with observers and appreciated being asked for consent for additional observers.

 > "I appreciated it, I wouldn't have cared but it was nice." - P7

 > "The refresher of asking definitely was considerate because I could have changed my mind, so that was definitely appreciated." - P3

All but 3 participants said they felt more at ease after observers said hello.

-   One of these participants did not answer this, citing that he did not know observers had joined and were waving because he couldn't see them on mobile. (Overall, 3 mobile users said they couldn't see anyone but the moderator, conveying that without being told observers were joining, along with hearing some hellos in the background, they wouldn't have known any observers were there.)
	- **Takeaway:** for this method, it's important that observers say hello in case participants cannot see observers.
	- **Takeaway:** This likely means that participants using mobile in any research study might not know there are observers unless we tell them - something to keep in mind for mobile research.
- Another of these participants spent more time greeting observers than other participants, but later said he found the hellos were unnecessary and slowed things down.
-   For the third participant who did not feel at ease, it should be noted there were only two observers in this session. Only one observer said hello and none of the observers turned on their video.
	- **Takeaway:** All observers that join should do their best to participate in this method by saying hello.

 > "More at ease since I could see it was one person and not a whole boardroom." - P9

 > "Um, I wasn't on the page that even showed that. I had me fullscreen and I had you as a thumbnail. But I didn't see..that might have been on a secondary screen in Zoom to see like a group meeting sort of a thing, but I only saw me and you only because I was in that mode, apparently." - P6

 > "It was kind of awkward." - P13
 
 > "It’s completely and utterly not necessary, and I myself.. Ya it slowed things down." - P4

### #8: A few participants had suggestions for miscellaneous changes on the Contact information page.

Following the tasks, a few participants mentioned miscellaneous items for which they had suggestions or questions, such as inconsistent capitalization in "Review your Address," as well confusion around the email address appearing in all caps.  

 > “The older generation thinks you can't change the upper and lowercase because it changes the email.” - P9

## Additional Findings

### #1: Multiple participants (3) described or showed difficulty with logging in, most often through MyHealtheVet. 

We observed difficulties logging in through MyHealtheVet and heard from Veterans that this has been going on for a while with this particular login method. Our 11th participant, a screen reader user, spent the majority of the session trying to log in with assistance from our screen reader tech specialist and was not able to make it to the tasks due to this extensive delay. The session was extended 35 minutes in an attempt to get to the tasks, but it was so challenging to log in, the participant still was not able to reach these tasks.

 > "In the past month there have been issues with it not registering my login, but I guess that's due to the changes they've been making. I thought oh it's just my system, but then it happens on other people's laptops and phones, not just mine. And the answer was to erase all cookies. And that would do it as long as it was cleared of cookies. If there was a cookie in there from a prior visit, it would act like it was logging in, but it never truly logged in, but that is just with the MyHealtheVet one." - P6

 > “This is just moving really really slow. I'm really glad you guys are redoing this website, because it's just been a mish mash of junk on top of junk. API, ID.me…this should be streamlined, I've been redirected 4 times already.” - P4, while logging in using MyHealtheVet

### #2: Some participants expressed frustration with changes to their contact information not being updated everywhere across VA, as well as not knowing where exactly it had or had not been updated.

Participants expressed frustration around not knowing where updated contact information was shared or where they still needed to make changes. In particular, they mentioned updating information on the VA website and later discovering it was not shared with VA medical centers, creating the need to continuously update information at different facilities. They noted a lack of information and transparency around this, and often referenced the "Change your address in your VA.gov profile" info page. 

 > "I'm going to call the main VA and find out...when I download the PDF that shows all your health information it still has, there's so many different, it just seems like it lists like so many addresses" - P6

 > “It is time consuming and frustrating. How am I supposed to remember to call to update my address when in a veterans thought process it is the VA? We wouldn’t know that these systems don’t talk to each other. In our brain the VA all ties in.” - P9

 > "Ya, like as soon as I moved here I changed my address and everything on this, on the computer, and every time you go to any kind of clinic, let's say I go to the eye doctor, I need to give them the address; they had the old one. You go see your primary care, you need to tell them. You go see the foot doctor, you know... none have the updated information. Unless you give it to them in person at each clinic, they don't communicate. It looks like each building has its own database and they don't communicate with any other clinic, any other building, anything else." - P1

### #3: One of our participants, a screen reader user who did not make it to the tasks, had significant difficulty attempting to log in and navigate the home page to access his Profile.

Even with guidance from our accessibility specialist/screen reader expert and extra time added to the session, one of our participants had an extremely difficult time logging in and navigating the homepage. It took 42 minutes to sign in, with the remaining 38 minutes spent navigating the homepage. If extensive research has not already been completed with both beginner and advanced screen reader users, the identity team and sitewide crew (or related teams) may want to consider exploring the current difficulty level of the login process and homepage navigation for these Veterans. 

### #8: A few participants reached Profile or contact information directly through the "Change your address in your VA.gov profile" page.

This page was often referenced or used to reach Profile or edit contact information. This may be something to keep in mind when considering the mental model Veterans have when looking to accessing Profile or editing one's information.

Recommendations
===============

### Bad address indicator

The following recommendations center around revisiting and reorganizing content while keeping the current overall flow.

1.  Consider revisiting the content included within the Contact information alerts to further simplify the text and avoid confusion surrounding the two pathways of Updating and Confirming an address
	* Simplify content in the main Contact information alert as it is often overlooked
	* Determine if it is best to further differentiate between the Personal info and Contact info main alerts OR if these alerts should be made exactly the same (with some participants assuming they were the same and not reading the second alert)
	* Consider separating out the Confirm instructions from the primary Update instructions and relocating this information to the smaller alert in the mailing address field within an [additional information dropdown component](https://design.va.gov/components/additional-info#examples). This could help remove confusion surrounding the difference between Updating and Confirming an address by presenting the Confirm information only when needed and where participants are usually seeking this information. (_Mockup below_)
	* List Confirm instructions in an easy-to-read format, such as bullet points, to more clearly convey this information
	* Consider including more information around why a confirmation is needed - in response to participants saying they would not want to update and mess with their address if nothing was wrong with it
3.  Change "Review your Address" to "Review your address" to match mockups
4.  Consider changing the email format to all lowercase characters


### Observer Method:
1. Make sure observers say audible hellos in case participants cannot see observers.
2. Encourage all observers to do their best to participate and say hello to help eliminate awkwardness.
3. During mobile research of any kind, inform participants of observers on the call, as mobile users likely can't see observers due to Zoom's mobile format and may not know they are present unless told.

_Recommendation to move Confirm instructions to the smaller alert within an additional information dropdown_

Next Steps
==========

- Discern technical feasibility of recommendations and any new accessibility challenges
- Evaluate recommendations with product team
- Work with Danielle Thierry on content-related changes

Further Research Needed
=======================

Because our recruitment goals for AT users were not met during these sessions, we'll aim to further emphasize hearing from these participants in our following UAT sessions.

Who we talked to
----------------

**Recruitment criteria**

We recruited Veteran participants using a lean maximum variation strategy, with an emphasis on reaching our goals for AT users. We leveraged Perigean's recruiting services to find our participants, but had difficulty reaching our goal number of participants who use AT. Many participants who marked down that they were AT users did not use this technology in the sessions.

We talked to 11 participants, one of whom was not able to reach Profile and carry out the tasks. Though we learned valuable information from this participant about logging in and navigating the homepage using a screen reader, we will not be counting this participant as having completed usability testing.

**Audience segment:**
-   Veterans: 9
-   Caregivers: 0
-   Family members of a Veteran: 1

**Gender:**
-   Male: 4
-   Female: 5
-   Unknown: 1 

**Devices used during study:**
-   Desktop: 6
-   Tablet: 0
-   Smart phone: 4
-   Assistive Technology: 1 (+ 1 screen reader user who did not complete usability tasks)
 
**Age:**
-   25-34: 1
-   35-44: 1
-   45-54: 4
-   55-64: 4
-   65+: 0
-   Unknown: 0

**Education:**
-   High school degree or equivalent: 0
-   Some college (no degree): 3
-   Associate's degree, trade certificate or vocational training: 0
-   Bachelor's degree: 4
-   Master's degree: 3
-   Doctorate degree: 0
-   Unknown: 0

**Geographic location:**

-   Unknown: 0

**Race:**
-   White: 7
-   Black: 2
-   Hispanic: 1
-   Biracial: 1
-   Asian: 1
-   Native: 1

**Disability and Assistive Technology (AT):**
-   Cognitive: 6
-   AT beginner: 0
-   AT advanced user: 0
-   Desktop screen reader: 0
-   Mobile screen reader: 1
-   Magnification/Zoom: 0
-   [Speech Input Technology](https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos/voice/) like Siri/Dragon Naturally Speaking: x
-   Hearing aids: 1
-   Sighted keyboard: 0
-   Captions: 0

**Note:** 6 participants responded to Perigean’s questionnaire saying that they used an AT device. Only 2 of these participants ended up using AT. This is not the first time we have run into this, so it might be helpful to take a look at the wording of this recruitment question and determine how more detail can be provided or requested in order to prevent this from happening in future studies.
