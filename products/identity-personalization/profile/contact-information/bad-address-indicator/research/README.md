# Bad Address Indicator Discovery

## Background

Each address stored in Vet360 comes with an optional Bad Address Indicator (BAI). When BAI is true that means that the VA has had mail returned to it from that address, which means not only have the taxpayers paid for a bad government interaction, but also that the Veteran in question did not receive her benefit.

### Discovery Goals

1. Evaluate how the VA communicates important messaging to the Veteran.
2. Explore different messaging locations on VA.gov based on communication findings.
3. Determine best options for messaging content at a high level - how detailed can/should the messaging be?
4. Explore technical options for duration of how long messaging is displayed.
5. Determine best user workflow of conveying message to the user and directing user to the best page to start the 'update address' workflow.


## Discovery: Communicating to the Veteran that they have undeliverable mail and their address on file requires updating

### The VA emails Veterans regarding information about other activities

Currently the VA emails Veterans regarding Connected Accounts, Direct Deposit and several other activities.

This is an option to consider: as soon as a Veteran's account receives a Bad Address Indicator (BAI) flag, the VA sends them an email message with some brief messaging and possibly a link for them to visit VA.gov to update their address.

This would be extremely beneficial for several reasons:
- Shows Veterans that the VA prioritizes them and important communications by being proactive in reaching out via email
- Would possibly alleviate some calls to the Help Center
- Would allow the Veteran to update their address to a deliverable address in the VA's system more quickly
- Would allow the VA to control the messaging versus waiting on the Veteran to log into VA.gov

### Would the VA consider calling Veterans to tell them they have undeliverable mail?

Still exploring this means of communications but seems like it is not an option to consider based on early conversations.
