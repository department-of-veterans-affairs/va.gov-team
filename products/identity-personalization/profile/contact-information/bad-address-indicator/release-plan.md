## Phase II: Staged Roll-out

### Planning:

- **Desired date range:** Sept/Oct 2022
- **How you'll make the product available in production while limiting the # of users who can find/access it:** The feature will be behind a feature flag.
     - 25% of users (3-5 days), Dates:  #44758
     - 50% of users (3-5 days), Dates:  #44760
     - If all goes well, then go to 100% of users:  #44759

 "Success" criteria (by the numbers):

- No P0's (launch-blockers) found
- Approval from the GO/NO GO call (add link)
