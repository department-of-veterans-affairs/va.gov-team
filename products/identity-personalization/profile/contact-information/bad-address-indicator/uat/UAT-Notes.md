2. Liz:
- On mobile
- Sees the mailing address alert at the top of the personal information page
- Link took her right to the address section, sees the alert under the mailing address
- Updated her address
- **Mobile placed her at the bottom of the page once it loaded so she had to scroll back up to the mailing address to see it**

- Refreshed the page, and the alert was gone
