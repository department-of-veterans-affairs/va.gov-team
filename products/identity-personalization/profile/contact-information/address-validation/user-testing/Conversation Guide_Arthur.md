# Conversation Guide: Candidate Address Update/Override

### Project-specific setup

For this research session, we will be asking users to share their screen and walk through a high fidelity clickable prototype of the Va.gov profile screen to edit/update the mailing address.

- Prototype link:  There are 3 scenarios we want to test:
 - Scenario 1:  https://invis.io/HDUJJ7LJPKX
 - Scenario 2:  https://invis.io/R6UJJ8NKU9N
 - Scenario 3:  https://invis.io/XRUJJ93H86Q
 
- Sign in: no sign in required

## Intro (2 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Arthur and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about how you edit your mailing address from the VA.gov

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 10-15 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** If you've had a frustrating experience or find something we show you to be confusing, we want to hear about it. Your honest insights help us to figure out how we can improve the veteran experience, and we will not be offended by any opinions you express.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** For this session, I will have you share your screen and ask you to show us how you edit your mailing address. Just so you know, these recordings are not shared outside of the people on this call. We use them only to confirm that we have captured what you have said accurately, and then we delete them a few weeks after the session. Do you have any questions about this? Are you ok if we record today?
-  **Last point before we begin - this is a design prototype, much like a demo where we will be showing information for a fictional user - this is why you will not see your own information** Do you have any questions about what a protoype is?

## Transfer presenter controls to participant (2 minutes)

OK, before we start the session or start our recording, we need to pass presenter controls to you. I'm going go ahead and do that now. If you are not already using the desktop application for GTM, you will be asked to download it.

*Pass presenter rights*

## Warm-up Questions (2 minutes)

OK,let's get started.

1. First, can you tell me a little bit about yourself? (If stuck, prompt to ask about service experience, where they live, their work).

OK, now I am going to turn on the recording.

*Start recording.*

2. Do you have a VA.gov account? If so, about how often do you use the website?
3. Do you sign-in into your account to make changes regularly?
4. Have you updated your mailing address at any time on VA.gov?
5. If you have updated your address recently can you tell me a little bit about your experience?
6.  Has the VA ever sent your mail to an incorrect address?
7.  How did the VA communicate to you that they had an incorrect address on file?  How did you correct it?
8.  How would you expect to be notified if the VA has the wrong address on file for you?
9.  How would you expect to correct it?

## Edit Mailing Address ( 5 - 10 minutes)

**Since these will be high fidelity prototypes of the dashboard and edit mailing address screens, we do not require a sign-in or LOA3.**

Assess the following:

- Their flow, and if they can locate the 'edit' feature easily
- Their flow as they click through the edit address workflow
- What their pain points are.
- What we could improve overall to make this experience easier/better.

(If time, and if it feels productive, ask about their experiences with other address update workflows on other systems)
