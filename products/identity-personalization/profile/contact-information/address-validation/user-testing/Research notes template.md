# Conversation Guide: Address validation: Participant 1

### [Prototype](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/34UP5BMUAJF#/391945409_1-_Intro_Screen)

## Warm-up Questions (5 minutes)

1. **Before we start, can you tell me a little bit about yourself? (If stuck, prompt to ask about service experience, where they live, their work).**

*Share screen and start recording.*

**OK, now I am going to turn on the recording.**

2. **Do you receive benefits from the VA? May I ask which benefits?**
3. **Since receiving benefits from the VA, have you ever had to update your mailing address with the VA? (If yes) Can you tell me about this experience?**
4. **Since receiving benefits from the VA, was there ever a time when you were not receiving mail you expected to receive from the VA? Did you ever find out why you weren't receiving this mail?**
- **If yes, figure out if this was because they had the wrong address on file.**
- **If applicable, ask how they figured out they needed to update their address with the VA.** 
- **Depending on the answer here, ask them about how we could better help them to keep their address up to date.**
5. **Have you ever signed in to VA.gov before? (If yes) About how often do you use the website?**

## First Task: Address validation with override and suggestions (10 minutes)

**Alright, now I am going to share keyboard and mouse controls and we are going to walk through the prototype.**

**(*Intro screen*) First, I just want to reiterate that this is a prototype... OK, when you're ready, please click "Go to the Prototype."**

**We are starting from the VA.gov homepage.**

1. **What would you do if you needed to change the address the VA had on file for you?**
2. **(*On Profile*) Now we are on the VA.gov profile. How would you change your mailing address?**
3. **(*On the Edit form*) Since this is a prototype, we are going to simulate typing in a new address by having you click into any of the fields in this form. That will update the whole address. (*On the updated form*) OK, now you have entered a new address. How would you save it?**

**(*Address validation section*)**

1. **Now we are looking at a screen that says "Your address update isn't valid." What do you think this means?**
2. **Why do you think you are being told your address isn't valid? Why do you think you are seeing this screen?**
3. **What do you think will happen if you click Edit Address?**
4. **What do you think "Suggested Addresses" are? Where did they come from?**
5. **How would you select the address you want to move forward with?**
- **What if you wanted to select the original address you entered?**
6. **Now that you have selected your address, please show me how you would save it.**

**(*On Confirm screen*)**

1. **Why do you think you are being shown this screen?**
2. **What do you think will happen if you click "View Suggested Addresses?" Why do you think we give you the option to view suggested addresses?**

**OK, please save your new address.**

**Alright, I have a few follow-up questions for you:**

1. **What could be improved about the process we just looked at?**
- **Do you have any questions about the process we just looked at?**
2. **What did you find to be clear and easy to understand?**

## Second Task: Address validation with override but without suggestions (5 minutes)

**Alright, now we are going to go through a similar process like we just went through, but it will be a little bit different this time.**

**First, please go to update your mailing address again. (*In modal after they click Edit*) Like before, please click into any field to update your address, and then save it.**

**(*On confirm screen*)**

1. **It looks like this address came up as invalid again, but this screen looks a little different than the last one. Can you tell me more about what you see and what's different than last time?**
2. **Why do you think there are no suggested addresses?**
3. **Tell me what you think your options are at this point.**
4. **What would you do next?**

**OK, please save your address. (*On confirm screen*) OK, please confirm and save.**

## Third Task: Address validation without override but with suggestions (5 minutes)

**Again, now we are going to go through a similar process like we just went through. We've got two more scenarios we are going to look at.**

**Like before, please go to update your mailing address again. (*In modal after they click Edit*) and click into any field to update your address, and then save it.**

**(*On confirm screen*)**

1. **Like before, the address you entered has came up as invalid, but this screen looks a little different than the last two we looked at. Can you tell me more about what you see and what's different than last time?**
2. **Why do you think you can't choose the address you originally entered?**
3. **What would you do if the address you entered was indeed correct but you were not able to save it?**
4. **Tell me what you think your options are at this point.**
5. **What would you do next?**

**OK, please save your address. (*On confirm screen*) OK, please confirm and save.**

## Fourth Task: Address validation without override but with NO suggestions (5 minutes)

**We are going to go through one more scenario. Like before, please go to update your mailing address again. (*In modal after they click Edit*) and click into any field to update your address, and then save it.**

**(*On confirm screen*)**

1. **Like before, the address you entered has came up as invalid, but this screen looks a little different than the rest. Can you tell me more about what you see and what's different than last time?**
2. **Tell me what you think your options are at this point.**
3. **What would you do next?**

**OK, please go to edit your address. (on Edit form) Click into any field to update the address, and show me how you would save it.**

## Post-testing questions (2 minutes)

**OK, those are all the screens we are going to look at today.**

1. **Overall, how could we improve the different scenarios we looked at today?**
- **(If they need clarification â€” "the process of telling people their addresses aren't valid and the process of suggesting alternatives")**
2. **What did you think was clear/what worked well?**
3. **What questions do you have for me?**
