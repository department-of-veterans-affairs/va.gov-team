# Initiative Brief Template
#### Overview

<details>
 
 *There is roughly a 1:many relationship between products and initiatives, or our attempts to improve a product/achieve Veteran outcomes. The same goes for product outlines and initiative briefs. This template can be used as product documentation for the Collaboration Cycle, especially when iterating an existing product. In addition, the Brief is an important communication tool within a team and between the team and Crew Chief/PO/other teams.*

## POCs
- **Slack channel**: [#accountexp-authexp](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/accountexp-authexp); [#va-profile](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/va-profile)
- [This is currently managed by the VA.gov authenticated experience team](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/README.md).

## Outcome Summary
The objective of this initiative is to improve the accuracy and completeness of contact information within VA.gov user profiles by building a contact email verification process. The goal is to ensure that VA Profile/VA Notify/VA.gov Profile are able to support sending timely and critical communications from the VA to verified email addresses, leading to improved engagement and reduced errors in delivery.

## Problem
Some VA.gov users have outdated or incorrect contact email addresses, leading to missed communications regarding benefits, healthcare, and other services. This issue affects veterans who rely on VA services, as well as VA staff who depend on accurate contact information for outreach.

### Key Challenges:

- The current profile setup does not require email confirmation.
- Inaccurate or outdated emails contribute to missed notifications and delays in service completion

### Root Causes:
- Lack of mandatory email confirmation during profile setup.
- Users not being aware of the importance of maintaining updated contact details.
- Insufficient prompts and frictionless workflows encouraging updates. (IIR launched a product focused on new users onboarding to the VA. This will need to form part and parcel of that process and is something of an extension of what they launched)

## Alignment with OCTO-DE Goals:
- Enhances user engagement and trust by ensuring seamless communication.
- Supports VA’s mission of providing timely and accurate information to veterans.
- Strengthens VA.gov’s data integrity and service effectiveness.
