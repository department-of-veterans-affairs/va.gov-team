# Account Security Use Cases

**Last updated:** February 15, 2024

If the user is not LOA3, or has a blocked account, the only thing they can access in profile is the Account Security section. Within Account security, they can access multifactor authentication and a link to their sign in service. 

## Common use cases
### User logs in with LOA1 account
- [User logs in with an LOA1 account](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/use-cases/loa1-user.md)
