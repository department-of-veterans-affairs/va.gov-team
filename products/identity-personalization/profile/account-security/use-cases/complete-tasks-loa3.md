# Account security: User views and completes tasks
**Last updated:** August 18, 2023

- Once users have verfied their identity, users can add 2-factor authentication to their account and find a link to their sign in service (eg. ID.me) to manage their sign in information.

## UX
### Link to sign in service
- The user will see a section with information on how to change their sign in information for their sign in service of choice. 
- The link will bring the user to the website where they manage their account (either Login.gov,DS Logon, MyHealtheVet, or ID.me).
- This section will never have a checkmark, as this task can be completed often and does not directly determine account security.

### 2-factor authentication
- The user will see the name of the section and prompt that tells them they can add 2-factor authentication.
- If they have not yet added 2-factor authentication, there will not be a checkmark next to the section. 
- Clicking the link will lead the user through the process of 2-factor authentication.
- This uses the [process list component](https://design.va.gov/components/process-list) from the VA design system. A numeral will appear if it hasn't been completed, and a checkmark will appear if it has been completed.
