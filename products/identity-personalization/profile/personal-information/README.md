## Overview

We pull in a small amount of personal information to the VA.gov profile. Some of this information is read-only and uneditable, as it is offical government record and used for identity purposes. Other information is read/write and allows the people to view and update.

Currently, we show:

- Full name (not editable)
- Date of birth (not editable)
- Preferred name (editable -- launching June 2022)
- Gender identity (editable -- launching June 2022)

## Projects

- [Personal information revisions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/personal-information/personal-information-revision/README.md)

## Backend

Personal information integrates through two different services:

- Full name and date of birth come from the [Master Person Index (MPI)](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/MVI.1886847049.html).
- Preferred name and gender identity come from [VA Profile](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/VA-Profile.1885602002.html).
