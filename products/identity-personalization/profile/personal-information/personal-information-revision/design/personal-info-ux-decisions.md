## UX Decisions

### Use label "Sex assigned at birth" instead of "Birth sex" 

11/17/2021

- Danielle Theirry in an email 11/17 clarified that we should use "Sex assigned at birth" vs. "Birth sex" as the label for the field previously called Gender.
- Samara advised to update all mockups accordingly and use that verbiage for testing.

### Information Architecture Feedback & Decisions

11/9/2021

- Changed order of personal information fields based on [IA feedback](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/32031#issuecomment-958188340) from Mikki Northius.  [Front-end copy documentation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/personal-information/personal-information-revision/frontend/personal-info-copy.md) is updated accordingly. 
- IA feedback also recomended placing the FAQ text immediately under the fields for **Birth sex** and **Date of birth**, but as Samara pointed out, no pattern for this currently exists in Profile.  At this time we will not modify the original placement, but may do so later if Christina Gednalske and Liz Lantz come up with a different solution.
- Confirmed that we will use the term "Birth sex" in place of "Gender" as is established by MPI's data and also recommended by Danielle Theierry.

### Use experimental design pattern on radio inputs

### Radio buttons - input field, error state, and interactivity specifics

12/8/2021

- Checked in with Kevin and determined input text fields are already present in edit state - no hidden elements
- (tentative) When typing into input field, automatically check matching radio button for "An answer not listed here"

#### Decisions

- No major changes needed. 
- Remove icons in read mode to simplify development; text should be sufficient for scanning.
- Will add success states and additional context to form field labels
