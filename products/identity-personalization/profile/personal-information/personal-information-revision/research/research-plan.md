Research Plan for Profile Team, Personal Information, November 2021
===================================================================

Background
----------

The addition of preferred name/pronouns/gender identity/sexual orientation fields within the Personal Information section of the VA.gov Profile aims to to mitigate issues around Veterans showing up to health appointments and being addressed improperly. These changes also allow veterans to more accurately describe themselves within the VA.

[Product Brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/personal-information/personal-information-revision)

OCTO Objectives
---------------

- Increase the quality and reliability of VA services
- Logged-in users can update their personal information easily and instantly
- Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

Veteran Journey
---------------

Vision: 

Allow veterans to see and update their personal information so they have agency over how they're addressed by VA staff.

Mission: 

Add preferred name, pronouns, gender identity, and sexual orientation to help veterans accuately describe themselves within the VA.

Research Goals
--------------

-   Evaluate whether Veterans understand the terminology used in the Personal Information section as it pertains to updating or changing their preferences.
-   Validate that the order of information makes sense to Veterans.
-   Evaluate whether or not Veterans understand what this information is and why we are asking for it.

We will use these learnings from this research to determine if any content or IA changes are needed and refine our designs accordingly before they go into production.

### Research Questions

Content/IA:

-   Do the fields/information presented in the Personal Information section match Veterans' expectations?
-   Does the wording of options presented in the Personal Information section match Veterans' expectations?
-   Do Veterans understand the terminology used in the Personal Information section?
-   What terms do Veterans use to describe themselves pertaining to gender, sexual identity pronouns, and names? 
-   How do Veterans expect to see this information organized on the page? Does anything about the placement of these fields cause confusion?
-   Do veterans find that there are any fields or options missing?

Relevance/Privacy/FAQ:

-   Do Veterans understand what this information is and why we are asking for it? (FAQ)

### Hypothesis

-   Veterans will understand how to update their personal information preferences
-   Veterans will be pleased to have more control over how they are addressed when interacting with VA representatives 
-   Veterans will understand the overall fields and options but may have different expectations regarding specific terminology
-   Veterans will show confusion regarding specific terminology. We expect that some of the wording may be different than what they are used to.
-   Veterans will have questions about why we are asking for this information and where/how the information will be used.
-   Veterans will have questions as to whether or not this information is required.

### Method

We will be conducting remote, moderated interviews using Zoom. The sessions will be moderated using a high-fidelity prototype showing different edit states to allow participants to respond to the options for each state. We are most interested in feedback regarding content and IA; ability to move through and edit the forms on Profile has already been tested in previous research.
