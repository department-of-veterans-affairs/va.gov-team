## Intro - 3 minutes

-----------------

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Christina and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about and look at a section of the Profile on the VA.gov website that helps Veterans update their personal information. We'd like to hear your thoughts and get your feedback on this section of the site.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 30 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability.** We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veterans' needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.

- **You'll be interacting with a prototype and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits. Do you have any questions about that?

- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**

- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?


Receiving the Prototype Link and Sharing Screen - 1-5 minutes
-------------------------------------------------------------

Ok, so we'll move on to the prototype. I'm going to send you a link in the chat and then have you share your screen.

*Send a link to the prototype, which starts on the Personal Information page.*

**Instructions for finding Zoom chat (if needed)**

- In the Zoom application on your computer, you'll see a row of buttons at the bottom.

  - Computer: Just to the left of center is a conversation bubble that says Chat.
  	- If don't see chat, ASK: Do you see the red "Stop Share" button? If so, put your mouse just above it and see if you see more Zoom controls. Then click on the Chat button in the center of the Zoom controls.

  - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.

Were you able to open the link and view it in the browser? Great. Now would you be able to go ahead and share your screen with me?

**Screen sharing instructions (if needed)**

- In the Zoom application on your phone or computer, you'll see a row of buttons at the bottom. In the center is a green button that says Share (phone) or Share Screen (computer).
  - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.

- Now I'd like you to share your screen with me. Tap on the green button that says Share. You will then see options for what to share. Please choose "Screen" or your web browser.
  - Great, now I can see your screen! Thank you for your patience in figuring this out.

- Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:
  - Ok, it seems like we're having trouble sharing your screen, so I'm going to share my screen with you and give you control of it. Does that sound ok? *[Share your screen]*. Can you confirm if you can see my screen? *[Give mouse control]* Can you click and see if you can move your mouse around on my screen?

Great! Now that we are all set up, I will have you try a few things in the prototype.


## 

------

As I mentioned, we will be looking at a section of the Profile on the VA.gov website that helps Veterans update their personal information - in order to determine if the information makes sense and is presented in a way that is helpful for Veterans. I will have you go through a few parts of the prototype that will help us understand if changes or improvements need to be made. As we go through the session, I'd like to remind you to think outloud and talk through what you are seeing and doing. This helps us understand more about your experience using this prototype.
