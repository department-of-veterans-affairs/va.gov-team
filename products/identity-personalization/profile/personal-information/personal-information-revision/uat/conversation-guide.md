# Conversation Guide: Profile Personal Information UAT

- Make sure dev team has turned on feature for user
- Post in #feedback-backchannel
- Mute Slack notifications

## Intro - 2 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is Christina, and I also have a note taker and another member of the website team with me. We're working on a new section of the Profile on the VA.gov website that helps Veterans update their personal information. The purpose of our session today is to make sure the feature is working as expected in your account and that you're able to interact with it as intended.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- There are a couple additional members from the website team who would like to observe the session and hear your feedback live. Are you comfortable with them joining the session? No pressure either way.
	- _Let other observers into room and allow a short pause to say hello._ Ok, so here we have some other members from our website team - hi everyone. And for those of you who just joined, if you could please turn off your cameras to save bandwidth, the would be great.

- **This entire session should take about 30 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** If you find something we show you to be confusing, we want to hear about it. Your feedback helps us test our work and figure out how we can improve the Veteran experience, and we will not be offended by any opinions you express. 

- **We will be able to see some of your real information today.** During any of the tasks if you feel uncomfortable sharing your screen with any of your information on it, feel free to stop screensharing and start again when you feel comfortable.

- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**

- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** I will stop the recording while you are logging into the site so we don't record your login information. We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately, and the recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis. So none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
	- _If yes:_ **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

_Start recording._

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 3 minutes

_Confirm they qualify for the study._

- As part of the scheduling for this session, we asked if you have an identity verified account on VA.gov. According to the information I received, you do have an identity verified account. Is that correct?

- Can you confirm for me that you have a DS Logon, MyHealtheVet, or ID.me account?
	- _If they do not know what that means, ask:_ Do you ever sign into any VA websites, such as VA.gov, My HealtheVet, or ebenefits, to access or apply for your benefits?
		- _If no:_ I’m not sure we can proceed if that’s the case. Have you ever had to enter a username and password to access your VA benefits online or anything like that?
			- _If still no, end the session:_ Without that account access, we won’t be able to test this feature with you today, so I’m going to end the session. Thank you so much for your willingness to participate. 

- Do you know your username and password?
	- _If not:_ Are these readily accessible? Could you get them?
	- _If the user can not remember or retrieve their login credentials, end the session:_ Without login credentials, we aren't able to test this feature with you today so I'm going to end the call. Thank you so much for your willingness to participate; it is greatly appreciated.

- Great! In that case, I'd like you to open a new tab in your browser, and go to https://www.va.gov/.
 
- I'll now stop the recording and you can go ahead and log in. _Stop recording._

- _Start recording._ Ok, now that you're logged in, could you please share your screen?
	- _If needed:_ You can do that by clicking the green button on the bottom of the Zoom window that says "Share Screen." It will then ask you which window you'd like to share and you can share either just your web browser where you'll be looking at the page we're testing or your entire desktop/background.
	- _If no, explain this is necessary for testing. If they are still unwilling, end the call._ I completely understand. However if you're not comfortable sharing your screen for the session, we aren't able to test this feature with you today so I'm going to end the call. Thank you so much for your willingness to participate; it is greatly appreciated.

## 1. Review Personal information section - 5 minutes

- Great. Thank you! Now that you are logged in and sharing your screen, please go to your Profile by selecting your name in the top right corner. 
- So we're going to be reviewing this Personal information section that is on this page. And as a reminder feel free to think out loud as we go along. This really helps us get a better idea of your experience on the site.

#### UAT and Usability
- [ ] **UAT TASK:** _Confirm that they are LOA3. If they are not, they'll see a "Verify your identity" prompt. If they are not LOA3, end the session._ I see that your identity isn't yet verified. Because of that we aren't able to test this feature with you today so I'm going to end the call. Thank you so much for your willingness to participate; it is greatly appreciated.
- [ ] **UAT TASK:** _If records can't be matched and an error appears, end the session._ I see that the system is unable to match your records. Because of that we aren't able to test this feature with you today so I'm going to end the call. Thank you so much for your willingness to participate; it is greatly appreciated.

If they are LOA3:
- Without selecting anything yet, why do you think VA asks for this information? 
- If you were trying to learn more about the information included here, where would you search for that / where do you think that would be on this page?
- Is this information required? Why does this seem that way?

#### UAT and Usability

## 2. Update information - Preferred name - 5 minutes

- Now let’s review each editable section, starting with Preferred name. I’ll have you go ahead and select that section to make sure it works how it should.

- _If NOT already specifically addressed:_ So we just talked about why VA might ask about this specific information. How would you learn more about this at this point?
	- _If needed:_ Did you notice the sentence (in gray) under the Preferred name title of the section? 
	- How does or doesn’t this information answer your questions or clarify this?

- _If already addressed:_ We already discussed a little about why VA might ask about this information, but if you can again review the information you pointed out in this field (gray hint text), is anything unclear about this?
	
- Ok, now this is totally optional, but if you are comfortable doing so, you can type in your Preferred name and save your entry. I do want to make it clear that once you enter information here, it can be edited but not fully deleted. So if you don't want to update this, you don't have to. Just let me know. _If needed:_ You can just enter [YOUR FIRST NAME] so we can make sure this functions as intended.
	- _If YES to question above:_ Is there anything about this process that is unclear?

- How might it be helpful for you to have a way to remove information entered here? _OR_ Would it be helpful or not for you to have a way to remove information here? Why's that?

## 3. Gender identity - 5 minutes

- Now let’s review the Gender identity section. I’ll have you go ahead and select that section to make sure it works how it should.

## 5. (Optional if time) - Update and Refresh Page

Ok, now that we've finished all the tasks and have a little extra time, I have one more thing I like you to try.

- We're going to change your Preferred name information again, select update, and then refresh the entire page right away using the refresh button in your browser window. And don't worry, we will change your information back again once we've tried this.

- So first, could you please select Preferred name and enter something slightly different? For example, you could enter [VERSION OF NAME]. 

- Great, now go ahead and press update, and then right away select the refresh button at the top of your browser window to refresh the entire page.
	- _If needed:_ This is usually a circular arrow in the top left part of your browser window next to the URL. 

- How did this or didn't this match up with what you were expecting to happen?

- Was there anything unclear or confusing about this?

- Thanks for trying that. This is a bug that we're working to sort out, so it's great to get your feedback.

- Ok, now let's go back and change your information back to [PREVIOUS ENTRY]

- Great. And just to confirm - does the information you have entered now seem correct?


## Post-Task Interview - 2-3 minutes

- Thank you so much! That was everything on the page I wanted to try out with you today. This has been so helpful for our team. 

- Do you have any feedback on what we reviewed in this session or questions for me?

- And so you are aware, this feature will be temporarily removed from your Profile now until it is fully launched on VA.gov, so if you don't see this Personal information page with your information next time you log on, don't worry, it will be back once everything is implemented.

## Thank-You and Closing - 1 minute

Great, again thank you so much! That concludes our session for today. We really appreciate you taking the time to test these updates. It really helps us make sure everything will work when we launch them for all Veterans on VA.gov. 

So thank you again and have a great rest of your day!
