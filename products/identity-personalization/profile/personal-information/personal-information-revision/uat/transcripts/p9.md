## 1. Review Personal information section

Without clicking on anything yet, why do you think the VA asks for this information? 

To ensure that I am on the right page.

Information in the middle: 

It has my name and date of birth and shows my gender.

Why do you think that VA asks for this?

Because a lot of names are not self-explanatory for gender nowadays with who knows.

If you were trying to learn more about the information included here, where would you look / where do you think that would be on this page? 

I can go into my contact information and update that as well or click the edit buttons. Or the drop downs on top as far as to change your name or DOB.

Is this information required? Why does this seem that way? 

Yes because a lot of people go by different names than their actual birth names. 

Why does it seem like it’s required?

I don’t know.

Anything on the page that makes you feel like this is required?

I think if we left that one blank it would come up as a failure and you couldn’t save it until you put your actual information in.

## 2. Update information - Preferred name

So we just talked about why the VA might ask about this specific information. How would you learn more about Preferred name at this point? 

I would have to play around and see where I can get to it, but right now I don’t see where I could get information on that particular area.
 
Did you see the sentence in gray under the Preferred name title of the section? 

It depends with me because my name is Robert, but I go by Bob. Yes (I did notice the sentence there before.) 

Reason you didn’t pay much attention to it: 

I have never really been on this page.

Is there anything about this process (updating Preferred name) that is confusing?  
 
Not at all.
 
(Explains how it can be edited but not removed.) Do you have any questions about not being able to completely remove/clear this answer?  
 
No, I don’t see any problem with that. Well it is more personable when dealing with people and sometimes they pronounce your last name wrong. (More comfortable when they use preferred name.)
 
How would or wouldn't it be helpful to be able to remove information entered here? 
 
I would say yes because if for some reason you want to change it.
 
Just can't be cleared but can be edited. Is there an issue with that? 
 
I don’t see any problem with that.
 
Would it be helpful to clear it if wanted?
 
I mean personally I don’t care either way because I am not on it that much and once I put it in that’s pretty much what I go by.

## 3. Gender identity

Earlier we talked about why the VA might ask about this information. How would you find out more about this?
 
Did you see the sentence with the dotted line below it? 

No.

How does or doesn’t this information answer your questions or clarify this? 

The only thing I thought when I hit the dropdown was that I was going to get the choice of man/female or man/thinks I’m a woman or woman/thinks I’m a man or vice versa or whatever. 

Anything unclear about what you should know before you share this information?

Nothing wrong if you still think the way like most people, you’re a guy or a girl, period.

Is this information you would you look into it: 

No, I would just make sure I was listed as a guy.

(Instructs to click edit. Participant already has “man” selected.) Have you seen this before? 

I don’t remember seeing this, but now I see that it is required.

(Explains that info can be added, but not removed.) Do you see there being a problem with that?
 
No, because you have to be something.
 
Is there anything about this process that is confusing?  
 
No, it is self-explanatory.
 
Looking at this field, is this something that you would update? 
 
Well I mean they have to know what they are dealing with whether it’s a guy or girl.
 
What situations do you think VA uses this for: 
 
I would say more medical reasons.
 
Why is that: 
 
Men and women are different.
 
Explanation: 
 
General information I mean.
 
Do you have any questions about not being able to completely remove/clear this answer? 
 
How would or wouldn't it be helpful to be able to remove information entered? 

I think it should be a requirement like it is.

## 4. FAQs

Did you notice those before? 
 
No.
 
Please go ahead and click on the first one, is there anything unclear about the content? 
 
No, because it’s like with me I was adopted and my name was changed when I was adopted so, and like when a women gets married or some guy gets married nowadays I don’t know; they change their name.
 
Ok, you can go ahead and close that and click on the second phrase, is there anything unclear about this content? 
 
The only thing about the legal name: it’s not showing it.
 
Where would you expect that to be: 
 
It should be under profile, I see it now in the blue.
 
Didn’t notice it before?
 
Correct, I didn’t notice it because I was looking down on…I was answering the questions. Like the other one gave you options and this one doesn’t.
 
Is this what you’d expect to see for your name: 
 
Yes it is there. It would be helpful right here in personal information because like I scrolled my screen now and I can’t see my name. 
 
Harder to find that way?
 
Yes.
 
Anything unclear about how to fix an error (2nd FAQ)?
 
No because it gives you a number in case you can’t do it that way.
 
Any other questions? 
 
Not at all.
 
Go to preferred name slightly, and refresh it. How did it match with what you expected: 
 
After you refresh it, it shows you what’s saved, it doesn’t give you a lot of other garbage that’s there.
 
Would you normally refresh it if I hadn’t asked?
 
No.
 
Anything confusing or unclear? 
 
Not at all. 
 
(Asks participant to change preferred name back again)
 
Ok that time it worked, because the first time it didn’t update it. I am not sure if it’s something I did or if there was a glitch with the computer. No big deal, I just had to do it again.
 
Other questions/concerns? 
 
No, but it made me interested to go through the rest to see what is there.
 
First time seeing this information? 
 
Yes.
 
Include contact information and all of the other sections too?
 
Yes, it’s got all of my correct contact information. 
 
But you haven’t seen it before?
 
No.
 
Anything else you want us to know? 
 
This is the second one I have done with you guys and I think it’s helpful to me because it shows me other places to go find my information and make sure it’s right, make sure everything is correct.
