**Can you confirm for me that you have a DS Logon, MyHealtheVet, or ID.me account?** 
 
It is a my HealtheVet logon. I already upgraded because they are doing the new thing so I have ID.me as well but id.me gets hung up so I use my myHealtheVet.

**Without clicking on anything yet, why do you think the VA asks for this information?**

Why would the VA ask for the personal information? Oh well I think they want to be able to relate to the patient comfortably and be able to relate to them. A lot of people go by one name and feel more comfortable when they go to the doctor if called by their nickname. Then of course the DOB is very important because you have to make sure you’re talking to the right person. The preferred name and stuff a lot of times they ask if you want to use your nickname because some people just feel more comfortable, like you're talking to family rather than you’re talking to an office or something. Gender identity, this is new, of course. At least now they’re acknowledging that people identify differently. That’s great that they’re doing that; they’re not stuck in the medieval ages. 

**Can you say more about why that’s great?**

Because in the military they are far behind on that. In the actual military, there’s no, yes there is some gender thing but they’re still behind. Whereas people expect when you go to the VA it’s going to be more of the same. The good thing about VA: they’re taking care of military people, but they’re not the military. A lot of times people don’t want to deal with the military anymore, especially if you’re a member of LQBTQ because that right away was like a black mark on you no matter what, whether it was from the people that you worked with or the people that you worked for. It was never a good thing. They said they were more comfortable with it but no. If you were LGBTQ, no. It was not good. It's good thing too because if you don’t feel comfortable then you’re not going to be forthcoming about your situation about how you’re sick with or what you’re sick with or you wouldn’t want to go to the doctor often, especially with the VA when you get covered with all the stuff you get covered for. If it wasn’t for the VA, I don’t know how I would have handled this cancer stuff. The fact that you don’t have to come out of pocket for it. I like that there’s a distinction between the VA and the military when it comes to treating people of the LGBTQ. There’s a huge difference. I think it’s because also the VA is not exclusively made up of people from the military. I think that is where the difference really lies. There’s some people that came from the military and work for the VA and they still have those old ideas but there are many who don’t.

**If you were trying to learn more about the information included here, where would you look / where do you think that would be on this page?** 

[scrolls up and down page] I don’t know. There’s a profile menu, but that really doesn’t expand upon what kind of questions they ask you. Personal information… No I wouldn’t know where to go honestly. 

**Is this information required? Why does this seem that way?** 

It doesn’t seem like it’s required. Because it doesn’t say required and it just seems like it’s optional. You can move from this page without having to change anything.

## Update information - Preferred name

**Now let’s look at each editable section, starting with Preferred name. I’ll have you go ahead and click on that section to make sure it works how it should.**
 
**We just talked about why the VA might ask about this specific information. How would you learn more about this at this point?**

Preferred name is how they refer to you, so… especially since sometimes yo might have a dead name, say you were Michael in the military and now you’re Michaela. So this is where you’d put that preferred name. Especially if you are not able to change it just yet, for instance you don’t have the money to change it legally, then here would be a good place to be able to use it.

**Did you see the sentence in gray under the Preferred name title of the section?** 

Yes. Ya that was noticeable. But I didn’t say anything about that. 

**How does or doesn’t this information answer your questions or clarify this?** 

Well like I said it says share this information if you’d like us to use a first name that’s different from your legal name. And like I said there’s the dead name part or if you had a nickname. For instance, some people refer to me as [nickname] which I changed now because every dog and parrot is named [name]. That way I don’t feel offended dealing with my doctors and stuff; they call me by my correct name.

**Is there anything about this process that is confusing?** 

**Do you have any questions about not being able to completely remove/clear this answer?** 

It doesn’t say that here because edit is still blue. So it doesn’t say that you can’t change it because that would be grayed out. It seems like you could change this however many times you want. Because if you couldn’t change it, then it would be grayed out or it would disappear, like the edit part would disappear. That’s how I would take it on a website.

**How would or wouldn't it be helpful to be able to remove information entered here?** 

No. Well I mean you could just clear it right, that’s what I’m thinking you could do. [clears info and tries to save] Oh. I see, once you do it you are locked in. I think it would be helpful if you wanted to go in and change it. Or not have it. Yes, I think that would be helpful. (removing)

**Can you say more about why?**

I think it would be helpful just in case times change and you didn’t want to have that option anymore, you’re just cool with them calling you whatever. Ya then you feel like you have more control over your name. A sense of control is very important, especially when it comes to your name and stuff.

## Gender identity

**Now let’s look at the Gender identity section. I’ll have you go ahead and click on that section to make sure it works how it should.**
 
**Have you come here before? (Field already filled in)**
 
No I haven’t.
 
**How would you find out more about this?** 
 
How would I find out? [clicks on FAQ] Ah, that’s what I would do. I would click on that thing and it tells you more about it there when you touch that explanation. 
 
Okay so if you want to share your gender identity with your health records only then talk to your health team. Ok.
 
**Do you have any questions about this? How does or doesn’t this information answer your questions or clarify this?** 

I don’t, I honestly don’t know why this would be important, but it explained a lot when they say they can better assess your health care, your needs, and your risks, especially if you’re in a relationship and stuff like that; there may be domestic violence and stuff going on too. Say for instance you weren’t before and now you are changing, you want to be represented correctly, especially transgender men and transgender women. You want to make sure they’re represented correctly, especially when you’re talking to the doctor and they treat you. Because they’ll know who exactly they are dealing with. The cemetery thing too I didn’t even think about that. That’s important too, in death your respect goes all the way there. Respect of the person, so ya, definitely. Being a [inaudible] man versus and a transgender man are two different things.

I’m going to change mine right now. But ya that wasn’t there before. [changed selection to non-binary]

**Why you changed it, why is it important:** 

Because it’s something that I only now realized in myself and I want that to be extended to my care too. How people relate to me and talk to me, and the pronouns are important too, but I also know it’s definitely a part of my identity. It’s so much a part of me. And I didn’t realize it until my granddaughter came out. My Grandmother was non-binary and there was no word for what she was then. She was the way she was. I am the way I am. And now my granddaughter came out and I’m like that’s exactly who I am. And I’m so thankful that my son is allowing his kids to be who they are. Ya, so it’s very important to me. Not just important to me, but it’s a part of my journey right now. And that may change I don’t know. But right now everything’s pointing towards non-binary. And that doesn’t mean sexual preference; it’s just gender. Like I don’t feel male I don’t feel female. Some days I just feel me.

It’s just something that you realize that you wake up this way and growing up there was no way to identify that. I didn’t know what…I felt so much out of pocket. I felt I should be this way. I am this, I should be more this… and it just didn’t work. It worked sometimes and other times it was like that just wasn’t me. I felt like I was ignoring a whole part of me. And then to be able to be all of that here at the VA with all the programs they have to offer and stuff like that. And they’re very respectful. Especially the counselors and stuff, they’re very respectful and very caring about how you want them to refer to you and stuff like that. The whole health department, that’s where…I had a lot of time over there because I went to [inaudible] and stuff like that, so over there, those counselors and those peer counselors and stuff like that, they’re very respectful and very careful and very everything, you know so I’m so glad. That was my first experience with the VA then you know with the cancer and the other side of the VA and stuff like that, but still it’s been very respectful all around. They’re very careful.
