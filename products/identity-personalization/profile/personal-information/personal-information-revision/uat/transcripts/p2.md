## 1. Review Personal information section

Without clicking on anything yet, why do you think the VA asks for this information? 

So they can find the right person. You mean to authenticate who I am? Just for me to feel comfortable as a person. I may not prefer to be called a certain name, as well as gender identity. It is something for the Veteran to feel comfortable to help us I guess, give them what we feel as our preference.

Is anything unclear: 

No, I understand it perfectly.

If you were trying to learn more about the information included here, where would you look / where do you think that would be on this page? 

I would go to edit or the dropdown, maybe it will explain it to me. (Opens Gender identity FAQ) Yes.

Is this information required? Why does this seem that way? 

No, it is optional. Because like the DOB is required, so it’s already there for you, but anything else you have the option to edit it and go in and change it. I guess you could change the DOB you choose to could change but that would be more like something you would have to go through, speak to someone and get documents to fix vs. to do it on your own. 

Anything specific to tell you that?

No it doesn’t tell me. I guess once you go to the dropdown in Gender identity, it says sharing a gender identity on your profile is optional. I tells you right here.
Understood that prior to looking at it: 
Yes
 
## 2. Update information - Preferred name

Now let’s look at each editable section, starting with Preferred name. I’ll have you go ahead and click on that section to make sure it works how it should.
 
So we just talked about why the VA might ask about this specific information. How would you learn more about this at this point? 
 
If I had other questions about the preferred name? Um, I know why they would ask for one but I don’t know where I would go to find out why they would ask. I guess like it says it tells you exactly why. I have a nickname, so if I want to be called by my nickname I could put that in there, so they can recognize me by what I prefer to be called, then I could put that in there. But if I needed to find out why they ask that, I don’t know who I would talk to to ask why they need that. But it’s kind of self-explanatory as far as what they are asking, if it is other than my government name is.
 
Did you see the sentence in gray under the Preferred name title of the section? 

Yes.

(explains entering information - can be edited and not removed) 
Is there anything about this process unclear? 
 
No. Though I did think of another thing just now as we were talking. Another reason - because some people may change their legal name and then you know - if I decided I want to change my name, but everything in the VA system still says my previous name, I could put my new name here.
 
Would or would not show up for va records: 
 
I guess it just depends because I’ve had this happen with my last name before. Some documents will still say the old last name and some documents it shows my current last name. So it just depends on which systems it makes it to and with the VA it’s a whole lot of systems. It may update in some and not in others.
 
Do you have any questions about not being able to completely remove/clear this answer? 

No

How would or wouldn't it be helpful to be able to remove information entered here?  

IF we had the option to, once we input something, to take it away as we need to take it away or add it as we need to and being able to save across the board - not like we add something that we can then never fully remove it. If we had the option to, yeah I mean..ya I guess if we had the option to remove it on our own that would be a good thing, or add it on our own and save it.

## 3. Gender identity

How does or doesn’t this information answer your questions or clarify this?

No, it looks like they added more selections over time so that’s good.

What about the gender identity information: 

No, I understand it. 

Looking at this field, is this something that you would update? 
 
I normally wouldn’t because they already have it in my files, but I could. I don’t think it would hurt anything.
 
Explain why: 
 
I can just select it because it’s here and just put update, but I know that they already have it within the system. Now if I decided to change my gender, I guess this would be the place to go, but as it states inside the grayed out place, you can also talk to your healthcare team and they could do it that way. 
 
Is there anything about this process that is confusing? 
 
Nope
 
Do you have any questions about not being able to completely remove/clear this answer? 

No, I understand that. These can always be changed; I can still save it, you just can’t put nothing at this point because I already put something.
 
If you didn’t want to share it what would you do: 

Um there's an option that says prefer not to answer. So select prefer not to answer.
 
How would or wouldn't it be helpful to be able to remove information entered? 

I think it would be helpful because this is our preference, this is something as a person we what we choose for people identify us as. Although as I said, because we have so many records already in the system, they know to call us our name and stuff like that, but if something should change, it’s beneficial to us maybe in the system allow them to see hey she likes to be called this or this is how she identifies to better assist us.

Any reason you’d want to remove it: 

I don’t think I would fully want to remove it unless all my stuff fully changes and I don’t want to be part of the system anymore. That’s the only way I could see wanting to fully remove it.

## 4. FAQs - 3 minutes

Did you notice those before? 
 
No, I never paid attention to it.
 
Please go ahead and click on the first one and read the content.
 
Is there anything unclear about the content? 
 
No, the only thing I would say is when they say we need to tell us so we can change your name in our records. Is that something that we need to verbally speak to someone about or send an email or something about?
 
What does it seem like: 
 
I guess I would need to keep reading first, maybe something will tell me in here (clicks link from FAQ). Okay, it explains to contact the VA medical center. Okay. Like I said before it’s different entities of the VA system because there’s so many, so it looks like you have to kind of tell them - different areas. You have to tell the different areas. You can’t tell just one system and expect it to go to each system. So it’s pretty much you’re communicating to everyone you want to make the updates to.
 
Anything on that page (Personal info) prior before coming here: 
 
No, because it is already established that there is a link and normally once you click the link it goes into details so once I click the link I could see the additional information. If that wasn’t there I probably would expect a lot more. But because I see that it helps a lot.
 
Ok you can close that and click on the second phrase, is there anything unclear about this content?  
 
Yes, this is clear as well. Okay.
 
Any questions about this: 

No, it's clear.
 
Ok, thank you. You can go ahead and close that as well.
 
Refresh task:

(Explains how to do refresh task)

Change your name slightly and refresh the page: 

It went back to the original.

Meet expectations: 

I expected it to update what I put and it didn’t, it went back to what I had initially. So this looks like once you put something in it is stuck until you actually contact someone to get it updated.

When you say it’s stuck, like to what it was before: 

Yes

Is that what it seems like?

Yes

At this point what would you do to try to update it: 

I guess I would contact the VA.

Other thoughts on this: 

I guess if I decided to change it, the change should stick. I will try it again. Oh, yeah see.

Trying to change gender: 

Oh look it stuck for the preferred name, it did fix for the preferred name, but then it didn’t change it for gender. I think maybe you need to do it a couple times, maybe refresh the page a couple times after you input it a couple times. It worked, just not the first time.

Would you normally refresh the page: 

No. So maybe having to do it without refreshing would be work. Initially I would be discouraged a little bit, so it may be one of those instances if you don’t keep playing with something, you just do it you don’t think it works, now we sit on the phone for hours with someone from the VA.

IF you hadn’t done more it would be fine: 

If I hadn’t played with it, I feel like it still would’ve said [what I originally put]. Maybe. Like Gender identity, the first time I did it, it didn’t work, it still said what I put first, but if I continue to play with it, it will change it.

Post-Task Interview

Thank you so much! That was everything on the page I wanted to try out with you today. This has been so helpful for our team.

Do you have any feedback on what we looked at in this session or questions for me? 

This is a great insight because I didn’t know anything about any of this. Being able to change things, and definitely when it comes to the preferred name because like I said it may be something we’re more comfortable with being called. So thank you. 

Thank-You and Closing

Great, again thank you so much! That concludes our session for today. We really appreciate you taking the time to test these updates. This helps us to make sure everything will work when we launch them for all Veterans on VA.gov.

So thank you again and have a great rest of your day!
