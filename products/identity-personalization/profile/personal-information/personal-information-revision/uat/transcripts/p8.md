As part of the scheduling for this session, we asked if you have an identity verified account on VA.gov. According to the information I received, you do have an identity verified account. Is that correct? 
 
Yes
 
Can you confirm for me that you have a DS Logon, MyHealtheVet, or ID.me account? 
 
Myhealthevet, I think all of them to be honest. Every once in a while I have issues but I can always get in on my HealtheVet.
 
Do you know your username and password? 
 
I believe so.

## 1. Review Personal information section 

I am on this a lot and my HealtheVet, I think I find information purely on accident.

Without clicking on anything yet, why do you think the VA asks for this information? 

Well under my personal information it’s weird. It's a how-to: how to update your legal name, how to enter or fix an error, it has my birth date listed, and then it has my preferred name which is blank it says ed it, and then gender identity. The only information that’s actually present is my birthday on this. 

And as far as the information that’s not present yet, why do you think VA asks for this?
 
Well I think it’s obvious they want your legal name, they want to know who you are, the preferred name I like because my legal name is [name] but I go by [preferred name], I go by my middle name. That has made quite a difference where the doctors and nurses will see and they’ll actually comment and say “oh I see you prefer [preferred name]” and I say ya. It’s a more relaxing thing for me. I’m one of those strange people that was given a name that all my friends, my family, everyone calls me [preferred name] nobody called me [legal name] to the point that I’ve joked about it and said if the phone rings and they ask for [legal name] it's never good. It’s either the bank, IRS, or the ex-wife’s lawyer. It’s not a good call because they’re the only people who know [legal name]. I would be in school and the teacher would call me [legal name] and my mind wasn’t geared to respond to [legal name]. I find that today if people say [legal name] I don’t pay attention to it because I don’t typically respond to it, so I think that is very important, just from a comfort thing. For gender identity, I think it is important. I look at that more from a medical reasoning than socially. I don’t know if anybody cares socially but medically I think it’s an important bit of information for them to have.

If you were trying to learn more about the information included here, where would you look / where do you think that would be on this page? 

On the VA page? I have no idea. If I wanted to go further to look for something more specific regarding gender identification I would have no idea where to look. But you’re asking me so now I’m assuming it’s somewhere in there. I’ve never had an occasion to look for it or to go through it. A lot of times I am just exploring the site to get a better understanding of what’s there.

Is this information required? Why does this seem that way? 

I would say it’s not a requirement because I don’t recall ever filling it out. I don’t recall ever answering a questionnaire or anything like that regarding it. And I’m assuming if it was a requirement I would have gotten some kind of kick back saying we’re still lacking information.

Anything here make you think it's not required?

It’s on the personal information page. I think typically when you fill out something especially online there's usually an asterisk * next to it that says required information. They’ve got to have your name or your street address or whatever. It's not marked as being a requirement. At this point looking at this page, I would think if you wanted to you are welcome to fill it out but it’s not being required of me to fill it out.

## 2. Update information - Preferred name

So we just talked about why the VA might ask about this specific information. How would you learn more about this at this point? 
 
Well I clicked on it and now it’s got an explanation that you can “share this information if you’d like us to use a first name that’s different” - and that’s true in my case - from your legal name when you come to the VA. I find it to be a much more comfortable environment when I’m talking to someone who’s calling me [preferred name]  vs. someone that’s calling me [legal name] because I truly don’t use it. [Legal name] for me at least, because it’s the legal name, adds a certain formality to the conversation. It may sound kind of strange but that’s the way my thought process is. So when somebody refers to me as my chosen name or my preferred name, it’s more relaxing, more comfortable and I think it puts down any kind of maybe wall or protection that’s there and helps me to engage in the conversation with that person a lot easier.
 
Did you notice the sentence in gray under the Preferred name title of the section? 
 
No, never. Well it wasn’t there on the other page. At least I don’t think it was there on the other page. I didn’t notice it until I clicked on it and then it comes to the area where I can type in my preferred name and update it. I noticed it on this page. If it was on the previous page I completely overlooked it.

Is there anything about this process that is confusing?  
 
No, not at all.
 
Do you have any questions about not being able to completely remove/clear this answer? 
 
I mean I think it’s a system issue. I don’t know why it wouldn’t allow you to remove it completely if you chose to. It could be a legal issue where you have certain documents now that’s going to have [preferred name] on it, in my medical records or whatever so you can’t take it out completely. I don’t know. I believe there's a reason why everything is done. It may just be a systematic issues where you can’t remove it for whatever reason or there’s gotta be a logical reason why they won’t let you just blow it away. There’s gotta be a reason. I don’t know what it is; I don’t know that it is important to me what it is. I think once you put it in there - this is a voluntary thing, as I say. It’s not something that says it’s required. So if you don’t want to do it then don’t do it. I am not so sure that it wouldn’t be helpful to have a simple statement where the updates are that says “please understand all updates - while they can be changed for future preferences -  they cannot be erased. Just to let people know there's a certain level of commitment there. Once you put it in it’s there.
 
How would or wouldn't it be helpful to be able to remove information entered here? 
 
Just a matter of personal preference. It’s a preferred name; it’s a preference of mine. If my preference changes, I would think you should be able to change that preference.

## 3. Gender identity - 5 minutes

Earlier we talked about why the VA might ask about this information. How would you find out more about this? 

Again I have no idea, on this website I don’t know that there is information. There's probably a lot of explanations, but I don’t know where it’s at or how I would get to it.

Did you see the sentence with the dotted line below it? Can you click on that? 

No, I should have looked. In the back of my head it was covid fog; it occasionally gets me. I thought to myself I didn’t see it on the other question I really need to look at this one before I advance and I forgot to look at it. It was probably there, I just didn’t see it. I looked at the bullet point.

Go ahead and click on that sentence. How does or doesn’t this information answer your questions or clarify this? 

Oh there you go. Ok. 

Is there anything that was unclear about this?

No. 

Looking at this field, is this something that you would update? 

As far as updating, sure why wouldn’t I? I don’t think anyone should or would have an objection to being who they are; click on what it is. 
I’m looking at this and it may be somewhere else…  I see a much thinner line between gender identity and preferred sexuality if you will. Obviously you’ve got a transgender man or a transgender women or non-binary. Every answer opens the door to another question. So if I click on man, which obviously I am, well then it’s are you a straight man are you a homosexual man, are you a gay man? What’s the story? It may be further down the road although it doesn’t appear that it would be. Having looked at your explanation, and maybe a brief explanation: I am a very proud gay veteran, I’m a proud father, I’m a proud grandfather, and my husband and I have been together for 22 years. So I’ve been all around the world there. I believe it is very important that your healthcare team right up front knows who you are and about you, for what I think are very obvious reasons. A lot of people don’t feel that way and that’s unfortunate, but that’s perhaps a comfort not only in themselves in being able to declare who they are, but in the system. it could be uncomfortable to declare who they are, but within the system, feeling comfortable in saying who they are. I have never felt that there was any type of discrimination or concern or difference in the way I was treated medically because I’m a gay man vs if I was a straight man. There hasn’t been any issue whatsoever. I had one issue, one situation where I changed primary care doctors because my primary care physician had retired and my initial visit with the new primary care was going very well and then I happened to mention my husband. And literally within 30 seconds of me saying the word husband he said I think we ought to order an HIV test. I looked at him and said if you want to waste the government’s money knock yourself out, have a ball, we’ve been together for 22 years. I joke about all kinds of stuff: personally I’m not gay, but my husband is. To me it is what it is, but it was funny that within seconds of my telling him who I was and what my sexual preference was he said oh well we’re going to require an HIV exam/test. I don’t care one way or the other, but that is the only time in the entire time that I have been with the VA healthcare system. I didn’t feel uncomfortable; I thought it was humorous to be very honest with you. But it was the first time that a lightbulb went off and I thought oh I think I struck a nerve with this guy. An alarm button went off and he said oh better get a test done right away. But that’s the only time. Nobody else has ever had any issue or conversation with it. 

Sexual orientation - Is that something you’d expect to see here on this page?

I would. I think it’s an important bit of information, particularly given the fact that you’re referencing assesses your health needs and risks. Well you know there are certain other health needs perhaps as a result of your sexual activity and preference. And unfortunately there are some risks. Because people choose not to take the necessary protection or whatever. So ya I think it’s important in fairness to the doctors and the nurses. It's gonna help them take care of you better, but at the same time I think it’s important for them that they feel comfortable. So I think they’re entitled to know. I’m 70 and my husband is clergy with a church that is known as the gay church in the country and the world today. We are in pride month; we have all seen and lost a lot of friends because of HIV. I can’t imagine if you were HIV positive that you would go to a doctor and wouldn’t share that with a physician. This not a hit or miss take a guess, this guy is trying to take care of you and he may very well be exposing himself. How do you not share that information? I think it’s critical information. So ya in this case I think that is certainly something that needs to be out there. And I think that ought to be an asterisk like ya it’s required. For sexual orientation. 
I think it’s a reasonable request that people would want to know that. 

If comfortable doing so would you like to select an option?

Oh ya, sure. (selects man)

Is there anything about this process that is confusing
 
Nope, not at all. 
 
Do you have any questions about not being able to completely remove/clear this answer? 

It just strikes me funny because I am thinking the information is shared obviously with the benefits administration I understand that, the VA-healthcare system, the VA-wide records. The VA National Cemetery Administration - I don’t know why that information would be important to them. I don’t object to them being able to access it. I guess if it’s in your VA file it’s accessible to virtually any department in the VA system. I just kind of think it’s funny that it’s there, like why do they need that for?

And as far as being able to change or edit this but not fully remove it, do you have any questions about that?

No, not really.

## 4. FAQs 

Is there anything unclear about the content? 
 
I guess the first thing that comes to my mind is why would you want to change it and the only thing that I can think of would be a marriage. Whether female is taking her husband’s name or in the case of a same sex marriage, a lot of our friend’s have hyphenated their names. In our case our two last names are two long, so if we hyphenated it wouldn’t fit on a driver's license. Or if you’ve changed your name. I guess there are probably more people that change their name than you might think, that’s fine. I don’t have any questions about that.
 
Ok, you can go ahead and close that and click on the second phrase, is there anything unclear about this content?  

So that’s just a systemic, you know, it was keyed in improperly or something and you need to correct it. I get hung up between the word change or correct - is it a correction or a change? In the date of birth, I would think it would be more of a correction than a change where someone went in and arbitrarily changed their date of birth or whatever they wanted. I don’t know if there's an advantage or disadvantage of it. Yup, ok no questions about that. It explains why, it’s just not an arbitrary go in and key in a number and change your DOB. They’re looking for it to be substantiated with a photo ID or passport of something like that.

Any questions or feedback: 

No, not really. I think there may be some information or some requests for information that it might be lacking. I don’t think it’s asking too much. I think it’s probably not asking enough. That would be the sexual preference; there’s nothing there about gay or lesbian. Transgender is covered there. I think it’s important not just for the Veteran’s physical health but also for his or her mental health and the accessibility of knowing that those services are accessible to him or her. I think that just needs a little bit more. It’s kind of painted with a broad brush it needs to be fine tuned a bit.
