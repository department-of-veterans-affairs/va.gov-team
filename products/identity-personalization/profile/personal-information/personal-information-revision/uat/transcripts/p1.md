## 1. Review Personal information section

**Without clicking on anything yet, why do you think the VA asks for this information?** 

Probably because of the way the country is going right now, people are starting to identify as male and female, people don’t identify as only male and female now. I’m guessing that’s why they are changing everything.

**What about preferred name:** 

Maybe because people like nicknames, or maybe people get married and want to change their name maybe. Some people don’t like their given name when born.

**If you were trying to learn more about the information included here, where would you look / where do you think that would be on this page?** 

I would click on this edit maybe because it’s right underneath the preferred name so I would click on Edit to learn more about stuff right now because that’s the only button I see that’s near it. I would probably click on this “how to update your legal name.” Ya I would probably click on this too. I would click edit part first. Because it’s near the area; it’s right underneath the preferred name, so my instinct is to click on that. Gender too (gestures to Gender identity Edit button).

**Is this information required? Why does this seem that way?** 

I mean, what do you mean by required? 

**Do you think you have to update this information?**

No, I don't think I would have to update it. I don’t see anything saying, telling me I must update it or something’s gonna happen if you don’t update it, so no I don’t think it’s mandatory.

**Because you don’t see anything that says it’s mandatory?**

Ya

## 2. Update information - Preferred name - 5 minutes

**Now let’s look at each editable section, starting with Preferred name. I’ll have you go ahead and click on that section to make sure it works how it should.**
 
**Is it clear why you might want to update this information (why VA asks for this)? Are there any additional questions you have about it that are not answered here?** 
 
No, like I said, the only reason why I would do it is if I had a nickname that I went by, or if I changed my name recently. But I feel like because it says preferred that’s more like a nickname not like a legal change name thing, so I feel like it’s more like a nickname. If I had a name I wanted to go by something else I would change it. Doesn’t seem very like, you know, like a legal change of name and stuff so...
 
**Did you see the sentence in gray under the Preferred name title of the section?** 

No, do you want me to read it now?

**Ya, let’s take a look now and does this answer any questions or clarify anything about this section?**  

Yeah, it is still more like a nickname. It's not telling me like I changed my name or anything. It’s just like a nickname I feel.

**Ok, now this is totally optional, but if you are comfortable doing so, I’d like you to type in your Preferred name and save your entry. I do want to make it clear that once you enter information here, it can be edited but not fully deleted. So if you don't want to update this, you don't have to. Just let me know.**
 
(types first name and clicks update)
 
**Was there anything about this process that was unclear?** 
 
No, but I don’t think I’d probably do it if it wasn’t mandatory. But I don’t really have a nickname though, so maybe that’s why I don’t place an importance on it.
 
**Do you have any questions about not being able to completely remove/clear this answer?** 

Yeah, that’s not good, like what if someone puts their name and they want to change it later on. Like how do they change it? Can you edit it again? (Clicks Edit) Oh I guess. So you can just click edit if you want to change it later on.

**Do you think you could edit at any time:** 

Yeah, I can understand, just hit edit again. Like if I get a nickname maybe next year I can put in a different name here.

**How would or wouldn't it be helpful to be able to remove information entered here?**

Um, like what do you mean? I don’t understand. 

**Once you’ve put in your name, we saw you could edit it but not removed it completely. Do you think it’d be useful if you could just remove it and not put anything here?**

Can't you just hit this and hit update? (deleted name and hits updates) Oh you have to put something. Um, you can’t cancel? (“are you sure” modal pops up) Oh. If I hit cancel, will it kick me out? So there's no way to get rid of it. Ya you should have the option to get rid of it because sometimes people stop…. Well I guess it doesn’t really matter because if you don’t want to use this, they’re going to call your name and your name’s already in here right? So should it even matter? Say you do cancel this and there’s nothing in there, then they're just going to call you by what your profile says. Can they see this too? Can the people see this (full name) as well as the preferred name? 

**Do you think so:** 

I don’t know what the VA sees but I would think when it comes up in the system they would see this and I guess maybe underneath this it would say your preferred name or something like that. That’s my guess. I’m assuming they would see this too and the person would make the connection. Nothing’s here (Preferred name), to call you this (full/legal name).

## 3. Gender identity

**Now let’s look at the Gender identity section. I’ll have you go ahead and click on that section to make sure it works how it should.**
 
**Was that confusing (in-line error for Preferred name text field):** 
 
No but we were talking about this. You have to put something in once you edit it. You gotta put something in afterwards. It won’t let you not leave it blank now. It's kinda annoying, but me personally once I put it in I probably wouldn’t change it.
 
**Earlier we talked about why the VA might ask about this information. How would you find out more about this?**
 
I would click this (FAQ dropdown). Was this on the other one? Ya that's not there on this preferred name but I would definitely click this box right here “What to know before you decided to share a gender identity.” Ya I wouldn’t hit update first I would click this. 
 
For preferred name, this wasn’t there. Maybe if something like this was there I would click it first maybe. For this box (gender identity) I definitely would click this first instead of update.
 
**Go ahead and read that text. How does or doesn’t this information answer your questions or clarify this?** 

I guess I highlighted this (part about info going into VA-wide records) because what does it really mean? It says it goes into your VA wide records, what does that mean? Who has access to this then? 

**What would you assume that that means?**

A lot of people, like everyone in VA has access to it I guess. But VA-wide records. It seems like more people have access to it though, why do they say VA-wide records?  I feel like everyone in VA can access it. Other than that, I understand it. I guess here it is saying if you really wanted to limit it to healthcare you can just ask them. I mean why why not explain how to do this (limit the disclosure to healthcare). Just call my doctor I guess? You don’t really give exact help to limit your disclosure to just the healthcare team. How do you do that? There's no phone number, there’s no contact or anything.

**So you wouldn’t know how to go about doing that?** 

Ya it would be more helpful to put some instructions, I would assume to contact your doctor I guess, your healthcare team, but I think you maybe should have more instructions though to make it more clear. It is important, you are letting the person limit how much they want to share, so that is pretty important I think.

**Healthcare team, you’re not sure who that applies to?**

I would think doctor, but I don’t know. I would feel more comfortable if there was a number I could call and tell them like you do with credit cards. Like they give you a number to call and you call and tell them don’t send me mail anymore and they actually put your number in the system you give them like your social. Something like that I would want to be in contact with someone and tell them I want to limit my information to just my doctor.

**Looking at the gender identity field, is this something that you would update?** 

Yeah, I would put it on there. I guess I feel like the way the country is moving you have to update stuff like this now, but it is optional though. I think I would just because, just because the box is there. I wouldn’t do it because I felt like I needed to though, I would do it because it’s the box that has to be checked I guess.

**Feel like you should even though it’s not required:** 

Yeah

**Ok, now this is totally optional, but if you are comfortable doing so, you can choose a response here.** 
 
(select options and clicks update) 
 
**Is there anything about this process that is confusing?** 
 
No. I guess you can’t say heterosexual is that supposed to be for sexual preference I guess? Ya, nothing’s confusing. I understand.
 
**Do you have any questions about not being able to completely remove/clear this answer?**  

Ya, that is even more serious because what if someone changes their identity later on. They should be able to… they should have the option to change it. Well can’t you, ya you can change it though right. (Changes selection and clicks update, then changes selection again.) You just can’t remove it completely, correct?

**Right. Do you think it would be helpful or not helpful to be able to remove it completely?** 

No because it, well yeah I guess if later on you don’t want to tell people your gender. Ya you should be able to have it removed ya. Maybe later on if you don’t want to tell people. If you don’t want to reveal your gender identity.

## 4. FAQs - 3 minutes

**Did you notice those before?** 
 
Yeah I did when we first opened it up but where it’s just the way they are placed I felt it would be quicker to solve my questions by clicking on the stuff that’s near what you are referring to. Because we were talking about Gender identity, so I’d just think to click on whatever is near gender identity or preferred name. I just glossed over this (FAQs) first, I wouldn’t actually read this unless I needed more information. Like if I read this stuff (content in fields) and I didn’t understand anything I would probably go back here to see. If everything was clear, I wouldn’t probably look up here anymore. If I understood everything, I wouldn’t go back up there.
 
**Please go ahead and click on the first one and read the content. Is there anything unclear about the content?**
 
No, that is pretty serious. 
 
**To find out more:** 
 
I would click on this. (link in FAQ)
 
**Ok, you can go ahead and close that and click on the second phrase. And the same for this one, is there anything unclear about this content?** 
 
That is very clear. I understand that. It pretty much tells you what you need to do, exactly. Ya, very clear.
 
## 5. Refresh Task

**Let’s try to change the preferred name again, how does it match with what you expected:**

It didn’t do it, so something’s going on, something’s wrong. I would probably try one more time and if it didn’t work then I would look for someone to call I guess, or email. But it worked that time. Okay. Never mind. If it didn’t work again I would call somebody, but also once you edit this, I wouldn’t really hit refresh. I would just assume that it was done and I would keep doing something else. I wouldn’t have noticed it wasn’t correct until maybe the next time I login. I don’t think I would normally put my name in and hit refresh. I wouldn’t do that.

**Confident it will be correct?** 

Very confident. I just read this and it says different fill this out if you’d like us to use a first name that’s different than legal name. So then I probably didn’t need to fill it out then. If I had read that the first time.

**Would you want to be able to remove that now?**

I wouldn’t care, I wouldn’t be too like oh I need to remove it like oh my god. I would just say ok whatever. If I had read it the first time though, I wouldn’t have put anything in. because I’m fine with Harvey and that’s my legal name. I didn’t see that before.
