## 1. Review Personal information section

**Since it sounds like you’ll need to change your name, do you see anything here that would help you figure out how to do that?**

So I would probably start with this preferred name field. Since it loaded to this screen specifically I think I would update my Preferred name and from there I would look into how to update my legal name because it’s probably going to take a little longer.

**Ok, and it seemed like you arrived at that pretty quickly. Anything unclear:** 

For this part, no I don’t think so. It seems pretty similar to other sites that have these types of fields and FAQs available. I’m a little surprised that these two drop down articles were included right here, but I guess that makes sense thinking about it. 

**Why were you surprised?**

I feel like usually things are not optimized for people who need to change their legal names on the site, or in information stuff like this, so you have to kind of go digging for it, but I like how it’s right here where it shows your name and DOB. 
 
**Click on “How to change legal name” drop down:** 
 
(clicks on dropdown and link in dropdown) So ya I would probably scroll through this. This seems pretty par for the course. So I would probably look over it and see what I need to do then when I have time, go ahead and do it and change my name. 
 
## Review second FAQ: 
 
I feel like this one doesn’t apply but would be like if it was misspelled or something. It’s helpful to have here though because I think that’s the other main thing that people usually have problems with when they have their name on a site like this. 
 
**Anything else you would expect or what to be here:** 
 
Maybe a field for preferred pronouns. Other than that I think it seems good, seems like you’ve covered your bases. It’s nice that there’s a Preferred name field. I do really appreciate that that’s present.

**Anything else you would expect here:** 
 
I am not sure; I do not think so.
 
**Ok, thank you. You can go ahead and close that as well.**
 
**Without clicking on anything yet, why do you think the VA asks for this information?** 

So I feel like preferred name probably is just so you can be addressed in the way that you’d like to be addressed. That makes sense. Gender identity, it seems like it’s optional to put in, so maybe just like to contribute to demographic data, or if you want to put it in your profile you can have it there.

**Does it seem like all of this information is optional or just some of it?** 

It seems like it’s optional for Preferred name and gender identity. And then like DOB is just like locked in. 

**And why does it seem optional?**

It says edit to add a preferred name instead of like please enter your preferred name in order to proceed. And also this dropdown here mentions deciding to share and that makes it pretty clear that you don’t have to.

**You also mentioned gender identity used for demographics. Why does it seem that way?** 

I guess I’m just not sure why they would need it for other reasons.

**And if you weren’t sure about this and wanted to find out more, where would you look:** 

I would probably open this drop down menu. (gender identity FAQ)

**You can go ahead and do that.** 

Hmm, ok. That makes sense.

**How does or doesn’t that clarify any questions:** 

So when they mentioned the ability to better access your health risk and needs, thinking about that it makes sense that, especially people who are medically transitioning transgender would have different set of risk factors and it would be helpful to have those available right away if you go to a new facility or something.

**Anything unclear about this information:** 

I guess it’s a little unclear why the National Cemetery Administration would need to see it. Other than that it seems pretty straightforward.

## 2. Gender identity

**Is this something that you would update?** 
 
I am not positive; I would have to weigh the pros and cons I guess. I don’t think that there would be… My main concern is that I’m not sure if anyone would be able to see this data who would be responsible for if I wanted to become a servicemember instead of just being a dependent. And I know that that might cause some difficulties if people are aware that I’m not cisgender.
 
**Reasons:** 
 
So I guess even applying for non-military or non-government jobs it’s better to get your foot in the door first and show them that you’re a good candidate for the positive and then be like hey this is another thing you need to be aware of if I am hired, so that they don’t immediately discount you because there’s too many non-standard fields. So, it seems like you can tell just your healthcare providers separately from this. And the fact that they say that makes me think that other people can see this information if you put it on your profile, just like people who can look at your VA information.
 
**Want to know who can see it:** 
 
Ya, I think if there were a way to confirm that this wouldn’t be visible to anybody who would be responsible for promotions or getting a job, like that, then maybe I would feel better about putting my thing in here. I think if I were to update it I would put prefer not to answer.
 
**Other pros/cons you’d want to mention:**
 
So I think one of the things about sharing it with healthcare providers is that it makes it easier to start the conversation about medical transition and hormone therapy and gives people a basis to know what to expect before you have an appointment with a new endocrinologist for example. Something about that with me specifically is that I’m non-binary, so I would still have to have additional information given in order for an endocrinologist to pre-pare for an appointment with me, for them to know whether I was assigned female or male at birth. 
 
**And that’s something that you’d want to address separately than here, is that correct?**
 
Ya, probably. I think for somebody who’s binary transgender - so who can identify with either of these terms (transgender man or transgender woman) - it would be helpful for healthcare providers right away, but even then I know some binary and trans people who would just select man or woman that’s how they identify.
 
**Terms here, anything missing or off:** 
 
Um, I don’t know if it’s necessarily off or bad, but the phrase transgender woman or transgender women, both of them feel a little clunky. Usually people say trans man or trans women, but I think that in an official capacity like this it maybe makes sense to use the full word. I think that it might also make sense to have a field for your assigned gender at birth, but I don’t think that should be visible to anybody other than healthcare team. 
 
**Would you expect to see that on this page or not necessarily?**
 
Probably not on this page.
 
**Would you like to fill this out to day or are you still deciding?**
 
I don’t mind putting Prefer not to answer.
 
**(Explains that info can be changed but not removed once entered) Do you have any questions about not being able to completely remove/clear this answer?** 

I’m wondering if it’s possible to add the ability to remove it. 

**And how would that be helpful?**

I guess so it doesn’t feel like an irreversible change to your profile.

**Go ahead and update that if you feel comfortable.**

(updates with Prefer not to answer)

**Is there anything unclear about that?**

Nope, seems pretty straightforward.

## 3. Preferred name

**How would you find out more about why VA asks for this information?**
 
To me it seems straightforward why they want it, so I don’t know that I would seek out more information, but I guess if I wanted to I would look in the FAQ section somewhere and see if that was addressed in there at all. It might be beneficial to have something like this (gender identity dropdown) also up here to tell you who can see it and why they want it.
 
**Did you see the sentence in gray under the Preferred name title of the section?**  

Yes.

**Anything unclear:**

No, nothing that is unclear.

**(Explains that after adding Preferred name it can be edited but not removed)**

I don’t mind putting that in. I think it might also make sense to have a field for middle name. I’m not sure if it’s just a middle initial everywhere on the site, but I know that when people transition they usually change their first and middle name. 

(updates Preferred name) 

**Do you have any questions about not being able to completely remove/clear this answer? Is that something that might be helpful here as well?**

I don’t think I would ever want to but I think knowing that the option was present would make me feel better about adding the information.

**Let’s update the preferred name again - change it slightly to try it out:** 

I’ll just put my middle initial there. 

I noticed it changed the capitalization. That’s probably for the best, but it might cause problem for people whose names have apostrophes in them. The alphabetic fields only might cause problems for someone whose name is like a few letters and apostrophe and then some more letters. 

## Refresh task:

**(Both times were updated correctly.)**

**Veteran/active duty/dependents:** 

I am a dependent of an active duty service and I was told that that was, that that qualified me for participating.
 
**That’s everything that I wanted to walk through. Do you have any additional questions or feedback?**
 
I noticed that in the Gender identity field it looks like they’re alphabetized and I don’t know if that’s the best way to sort these. I don’t know if it’s bad necessarily, but it feels a little weird that man and women are so far apart when they’re kind of the same category of selection. It might make sense to have man and woman and then non-binary and then transgender man and woman. And then prefer not to answer and not listed. 
Ya just a little weird right now.
 
I’m also wondering if there's a way to enter in another gender identity if you select this. Maybe a text box where you could type in your gender identity. And that might also be helpful so if there’s one that shows up often enough then it becomes a significant group of people then maybe you can add that to the menu.
 
**Other terms not included here:** 
 
None that I can think of now. If there was the ability to enter your own here I think this would be an ok general set of answers. I think if you elected not to do that it might make sense to have like a-gender maybe or two-spirit, people who identify with those.

I did have one more thing I wanted to mention. I think if you did want to add a field for preferred pronouns it’d make sense to put it between Preferred name and gender identity and have like he/him, she/her, they/them, and then maybe the ability to enter a different set of pronouns if they you them. In the same way that the gender identity one might have the field for you to enter that.

**So the ability to enter something might be helpful for a couple fields?**
 
Ya.

## Post-Task Interview

Thank you so much! That was everything on the page I wanted to try out with you today. This has been so helpful for our team.

**Do you have any feedback on what we looked at in this session or questions for me?**

Another thing, I noticed in the scheduling emails my last name was misspelled. I’m not sure if it’s going to cause issues anyway.

## Thank-You and Closing

**Great, again thank you so much! That concludes our session for today. We really appreciate you taking the time to test these updates. This helps us to make sure everything will work when we launch them for all Veterans on VA.gov.**

**So thank you again and have a great rest of your day!**
