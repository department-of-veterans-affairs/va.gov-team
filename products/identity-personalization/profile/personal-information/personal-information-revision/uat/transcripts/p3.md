## 1. Review Personal information section

(Participant said “ooo” upon arriving on the page.)

**You said “ooo.” Can you tell me about that?** 

So preferred name and gender identity are big words within the LQBT community. As in like we know that you have a legal name, but do you have a preferred name? So for a lot of people it may be strange name, you know, strange by the standards of regular sociality. But preferred name automatically… For most people that might mean your name is Robert, but you prefer to be called Bob. But for a trans person that might mean their legal name is male name but their preferred name is a female name.

**Is that a positive or neutral thing from your perspective:** 

I am very excited; I haven’t legally gotten my status updated to reflect my status because of concerns, but it’s very easy to track down who has their stuff labeled certain ways. I have a friend who is trans, also non-binary, but when they started work they gave themselves a male name and instead of getting an X on their ID got a M because it’s easy to find all the people who have Xs on their IDs.

**And did they not want to be identified in that way?**

Not legally. (Tells a story about The Handmaid’s Tale and comparison.)

**If you were trying to learn more about the information included here, where would you look / where do you think that would be on this page? 
Without selected anything, why do you think the VA is asking for this information?**

Obviously there’s a level of being polite, but there’s also a level of if you’re treating people they wish to be treated, they’re more likely to come back. And it doesn’t really make sense to enforce… if they regularly come in looking like a woman, but you insist that all their documention reflect that they’re still a male, then everybody’s gonna be confused every time you see them. It’s much easier when they’re documentation reflects how they’re coming in. It is polite and it’s friendly.

**Is it fair to say it minimizes confusion:** 

Ya it definitely minimizes confusion.

**Where would you look to learn more about the info included:** 

They offer the ability to give feedback, but the only thing I can only see is that I can edit it. And then there’s obviously the underline for “what to know before you decide to share your gender identity.” That’s not there for Preferred name because preferred name could be Robert wants to be called Bob whereas gender is a bit different. 

For Robert to be called Bob is very minimal. That’s normal, everyone thinks that is normal. The only people who ever decide to choose their gender identity – I mean I’ve noticed that you all include your pronouns. I don’t include my pronouns because I often talk to a lot of different people. I don’t want to have to edit it every time I talk to different people. The only people who generally include their gender identity are the people who have a different gender identity than the one they were assigned at birth. Anybody can have a preferred name. Even though we all have gender identity, the only people who actually HAVE gender identity are the people who are trans and non-binary. So I appreciate you guys including the pronouns because that made me feel way more comfortable talking about this.

**Is this information required?**  

No, it does not seem like the information is required. It seems like it’s a “if you want to,” it seems like…it’s an optional field. 

**Why does this seem that way?** 

My DOB is listed whereas preferred name and gender are edits. By giving an example of my Personal information, you made it very clear.

**Anything unclear:**

No. I want to see what they have to include about the gender identity stuff.

Ya it would be nice if they utilized this information to help people with their medical care. I’ve heard a couple of stories about trans men coming into the emergency room and because they look like men they weren’t tested for pregnancy and it turned out that they were pregnant. So if it was known ahead of time if that was an issue, that would be helpful. I know I haven’t gotten a pap smear in years because this whole thing makes me uncomfortable. I have to go, but the way they talk about it makes me not want to go at all. So if they knew in advance and could be…but you know, that’s a lot to hope for.

## 2. Gender identity - 5 minutes

Now let’s look at the Gender identity section. I’ll have you go ahead and click on that section to make sure it works how it should.
 
**Is it clear:** 
 
The content makes sense. I can tell you for certain that for the majority of people these options are probably good. But I do know people who will be clicking not listed here. They’re not Veterans, but I do know people who would be clicking the other options. A lot of people who are trans and non-binary have very strong opinions about what their gender is because they worked so hard to get it, so being able to write in an opinion is probably important to them. 
 
**I saw you just clicked that (a gender not listed here):**
 
I wanted to see if I could write in the option. Because my one friend is bi-gender and they could put it there.
 
**Is this a field that you would update if you weren’t in this research session:** 
 
You know, I’d be… There would be days and times when I would be like no don’t do that and there’s be days and times when I would want to do that. And it’s partly… it’s June, and I’ve technically been out at work. I’ve just added it to my signature; I’ve added my pronouns to my signature at work because they can't fire me at work for it and most people don’t even read that block. They don’t care unless they’re looking for something specific like your phone number. But I have been tempted to add stuff at work, like you can add your pronouns to your badge at work. And I’ve been tempted to do that too, but they only add one option. That would be the other one. Instead of gender identity, you could just have pronouns. 
 
**Would it be useful to have both?**
 
It might be. My friend who’s bi-gender goes by all pronouns, except for it. I also go by all pronouns except for it. I’ve met people who go by it. Obviously that makes me very uncomfortable, but… The other option is to not go by any pronouns but just your name. In Chinese and Japanese they don’t do pronouns. Pronouns are very rude. If you translate it directly in English it sounds like a child is talking. Ya it’s a completely different issue of we don’t use pronouns. I’m a linguist. So what I’m saying is that particular style of doing things is actually normal in human culture.
 
**Do you have any questions about not being able to completely remove/clear this answer?** 

Understandable. No, because if I really want to I would change it to woman. There are lots of reasons why someone wouldn’t like me besides that.
How would or wouldn't it be helpful to be able to remove information entered? 

Ya basically the helpfulness of like, if I need to go back in the closet, I need to go back in the closet. Any time you do something online, there’s a paper trail. I am more protective than a lot of other people.

## 3. Update information - Preferred name
 
**Now let’s look at preferred name:**
 
Wow 25 characters max.
 
**Thoughts on characters:** 
 
I have no idea how long someone’s Preferred name should be. I’ve met a bunch of people. The majority of non-binary names I’ve met have been fairly short.
 
**(Explains info can’t be removed)** 
 
Enters name. Ya, at some point I might… I’ve been fiddling around with a different name.
 
**Can you review that text under the label Preferred name. Is there anything unclear about that?** 

_**Did you see the sentence in gray under the Preferred name title of the section?**  Didn’t ask_

I mean, that’s perfectly logical, like the difference between Robert and Bob. You and I have the same first name. It would make it much easier if you and I were both seeing the same doctor that they didn’t call the same name. And usually people who have longer names have some sort of nickname. My spouse has a legal name that nobody ever gets right, so if he could input an actual preferred name that’d be fantastic. It would be really fantastic because my spouse was putting us in at a hotel and they were like are you certain that you booked a room with us, and we’re like yes I booked a room, we have nowhere else to stay. And they were like oh we totally messed up your name. 

So preferred name would really help. Honestly, preferred name should be one of those things that they request from you.

**You mean kind of proactively vs. having to discover this?**

And that’s one of the things that people who are into preferred or personal pronouns are trying to get. It is easier when you come up to somebody and you say what your personal pronouns are and then the other person can share. If it’s a more common thing then there’s a lot less confusion.

**Ok, now this is totally optional, but if you are comfortable doing so, I’d like you to type in your Preferred name and save your entry. I do want to make it clear that once you enter information here, it can be edited but not fully deleted. So if you don't want to update this, you don't have to. Just let me know.**

## 4. FAQs

**Did you notice those before?** 
 
Yeah I did see them at the top. I’ve never had an issue, well I have because of my last name. … They misspelled my last name from social security even though they had my wedding certificate, so I had to send it back.
 
**Please go ahead and click on the first one and read the content. Is there anything unclear about the content?** 
 
I don’t see anything wrong with this. My name is listed right up there; that’s correct. My birthday is listed right there; that’s correct. It makes sense that it would take a lot of effort to change those things whereas it doesn’t take a lot of effort to change preferences.

## Post-Task Interview

**Thank you so much! That was everything on the page I wanted to try out with you today. This has been so helpful for our team.**

**Do you have any feedback on what we looked at in this session or questions for me?**

(discusses Margaret Atwood) My only point is that when you have an X you can be searched for. If you have an F, you can be searched for. That’s why my one friend did not… they wanted to switch to non-binary and they switched to male.

## Thank-You and Closing

**Great, again thank you so much! That concludes our session for today. We really appreciate you taking the time to test these updates. This helps us to make sure everything will work when we launch them for all Veterans on VA.gov.**

**So thank you again and have a great rest of your day!**
