## Recommendations from Research Study and Current Releveant Decisions
- Consider editing/updating FAQs to 
  - YES Mention the connection to/partnership with the LGBTQ Health Services to build trust from Veterans who are part of the LGBTQ community as far as why the VA is asking for the info 
  - YES include additional text/examples concerning how the VA will use this information. point to privacy policies already in place for this information.
  - ACTION ITEM - Remove gender from our content request.
  - ACTION ITEM - Reach out to LGBTQ Health Services to get more info and then work with Danielle on how we craft that.

- YES Have disclaimers/FAQ near each field - we don't have pattern in Profile right now, but there's something in the design system
- YES Consider utilizing hint text to help Veterans understand the value of sharing this information with VA. - (Ex: “How would you like to be addressed at appointments, etc.”). This is also better for accessibility.

- Group editable and non-editable fields together and place related FAQ information within each section. This will benefit Veterans by removing confusion around the field types and providing important information for each section when it is most needed. Ticket should capture inline info saying that it's optional - do we need the FAQs at all? We are 100% for inline/in context of "why we are asking for this" on all the fields
  -  NO - This one is a moot point, because DOB is the first one, and since we are removing Gender, it kind of fixes the issue.

- YES Consider removing Sex assigned at birth field (Gender). If not possible, clearly convey where the information comes from, why it is included, and how to change it. (Ex: “This information comes from our ___ database. To edit this field…”)  Remove from Mockups and Staging and Production.

- NO - Consider removing Sexual orientation field.

- NO, the options are dictated by the data.  Consider removing transgender options from Gender identity field.

- YES - Consider making changes that clarify editable fields are optional.

- YES - Add text clarifying fields are optional in hint text and section titles.

- NO - They can change to "prefer not to answer".  Add a Remove button (included elsewhere in Profile) to allow selection removal.

- YES - Alphabetize Pronouns, Gender identity, and Sexual orientation options to minimize misinterpretation that options are in order of “social hierarchy.”

- NOT RIGHT NOW Add text input field in Gender identity section.

- MAYBE Add a verb for "Another option not listed".  Run by Danielle and get her guidance

- NOT NOW - Consider adding Title and Religious Preferences as additional fields in future versions of personal information. Additional rounds of research can help evaluate whether or not this would be helpful to the Veteran population and VA.

- YES - Wrap up design for checkboxes/radio buttons.  Get Angela take a look at Rob Garrison's info

- NOT NOW.  For Address Change - Explore ways to slow people down so they take more time to complete this task and understand the implications of having a different home and mailing address. (Ex: Consider editing via “one thing per page”)

- ACTION ITEM - Get Lexi involved right away and include any assumptions we have about the FAQs

- YES - Preferred Name - clarifying what you like to be called. - ADD TICKET for clarifying

Pre-meeting notes:
	- Add (optional label to each field
	- Remove the Sex Assigned at Birth field
	- Remove transgender field from Gender Identity field
	- Guidance on how this data is protected and will be used should be more robust than a simple FAQ (i.e., a R&S article)
	- Needs to be abundantly clear that none of the fields are required to be answered
	- NOT YET - We can add a write-in text field for Gender Identity *IF* VA Profile becomes the authoritative data source (ADS).  Otherwise it will be a couple of years before the budget allows.
	- NOT YET - Gender Identity can also be made multi-select *IF* VA Profile becomes the ADS
	- MOOT - Group editable and non-editable fields
	- Alphabetize options
	- Update FAQ to link to an R&S article that provides more details about how the data is kept private and how it's used
