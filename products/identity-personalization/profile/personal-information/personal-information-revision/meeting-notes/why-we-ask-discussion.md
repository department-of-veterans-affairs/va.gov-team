## Discussion related to why we are asking for personal information

## Attendees
- Lexi Matza
- Michael Kauth
- Samara Strauss
- Christina Gednalske
- Marci McGuire

## Purpose
- We want to get in Lexi and Michael's words how they use this content, and then we will work with Danielle make sure it's in the correct voice

## General Notes
- Some of the content is actually in the fact sheets - how this is secure, etc.  This info is already approved.
- Danielle can also take a look
- It's easier for Samara to ask "why do we ask for this" so we can hear that, even though we know largely what it's for.
  - We'll take what we talk about today, and work with Danielle and convert that to content, so we don't have to work about getting the wording perfect
  - It's so Veterans understand why the VA needs this info
- Michael - it is important for people to get more information since these are very brief statements.  We may want to reference the fact sheets.
- Anything linked online - Lexi will send us the external page links.  https://www.patientcare.va.gov/LGBT/
- We aren't so concerned about length at this point; we can work with Danielle on that.
- We are not going to be able to get it to two sentences.
- People have had bad experiences, so we understand that saying "no! you can trust us now" is not happening

## Field-Specific Notes
- Preferred name
  - Many people have a name they like to go by, and it's respectful to use the name that others want to be called
  - If their listed name doesn't match, it doesn't matter.  That's the way they want to be addressed.
  - If Lexi was filling this out, she would want it to be clear that they are updating their records and not just filling out a form.  Like when you fill out a form at the doctor, and it never seems to make it into the chart.
  - Would it be accurate to say that this info will be used by VA and clinical staff, VBA or NCA?
    - Yes, but Lexi also thinks that CERNER doesn't have a connection.  Folks who go to CERNER facilities won't see this.  We may want to say "May" or "our hope is"…
  - Anything else that would be helpful for people to know?  
    - Preferred name can be changed at any time

- Gender identity
  - Michael and Lexi thinks that having pronouns follow gender identity will make more sense.  Providing that gives more context around why it's being asked.
  - We didn't hear any remarks about the order of the fields from users, so changing the  order probably will not be a problem
  - Why we are asking - Everyone has a gender identity. 
  - Lexi referenced the fact sheet (trans male/ male of center (MOC))
  - Provided that the profile is not a health care tool, what are their thoughts about how to address this?  The health care side is important, but how do we address for someone who is not a health care recipient? 
  - The health care piece is important, so we don't want to lose that, but the big picture is so that the VA staff know how to respectfully address the Veteran
  - There is a phrase on the site - "sensitive, respectful environment"
  - They're not going to say "Mr. when the Veteran wants to be referred to as Ms."
  - It's also used for rooming - restrooms, etc.
  - Are we looking for a definition or how the info is used?  Just how it's used.
  - Healthcare specific question - for the most part, this would update the health care record with the exception of a CERNER patient.  Yes.
  - Is there anything we should include about why someone should feel safe sharing this information?  People have concerns about it be misused or being used for discriminatory purposes.
    - Patient information is protected information 
    - VA has a non-discrimination policy that encompasses gender identiyy and expression
  - What does patient information mean?  It means that there are some safeguards about how information about Veterans can be shared outside the system.  
  - Normally it's HIPPA, but the VA privacy program is much larger than that - VHA directive 1605.01  https://www.va.gov/vhapublications/ViewPublication.asp?pub_ID=3233
  - Any other details around Gender Identity we should include?  
    - No open text, correct?  Yes, because the back-end can't currently support that.
    - Lexi - isn't the VA Profile new?
    - We will clarify with Barbie, but Samara thinks because MPI doesn't have it, VA Profile has to support all the systems they connect to.
  - We should make sure they know they can change that at any time.

- Pronouns
  - Is everything for gender identity applicable to Pronouns? 
  - Lexi provided the following about what happens if a mistake is made: 
    - "WHAT IF MY PROVIDER USES THE WRONG TERMS OR
    - PRONOUNS WHEN REFERRING TO ME OR MY SPOUSE/PARTNER?
    - Your VHA provider may not know what terms you prefer
    - to use. Let providers know how you describe yourself and
    - your partner(s), and they will start to use those words. If
    - they make a mistake, let them know! Your provider wants
    - to make you feel comfortable, and using words that you
    - prefer is an important first step."
  - Any other details we need to discuss?  Michael - it's really just information about how to best interact with the Veteran

- Sexual Orientation
  - This is a little different.  This is not about how to address a Veteran.  It's more related to health care, although there is a need for VA to better understand the needs of this demographic group.  It's not really the purpose of collecting this info, but it's one of the functions of having this data.
  - It's important to know someone's sexual orientation identity to provide the best health care assessment for the individual
  - We should highlight that it's most helpful in health care environment
  - It's important to acknowledge how this information has been misused.  It has been used to discriminate against people in the military for 75 years, and that was wrong.  This is an opportunity to acknowledge that gay, lesbian, bisexual people served in the military and deserve their benefits
  - It does have an impact on people's health care, and they should share this with their doctor, but many people don't understand the health connected reason for asking for sexual orientation.  They are going to focus on "this is the government asking me for information that they used to discriminate against me"
  - We are going to make it clear that this info is optional
  - We want sexual orientation and gender identity because the Secretary wants to k now how the VA can help and make it a more affirming place.
  - Overarching message should be the above.
