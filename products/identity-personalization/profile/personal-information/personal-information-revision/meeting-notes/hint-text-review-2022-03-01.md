## Notes
- Christina put Danielle's copy into Sketch files
- There were orphaned single words on the last line
- With the hint text and expandable info, it's cluttered and makes it challenging to see the current value displayed.
- Christina reviewed with Angela; she didn't really see a concern.  She had thoughts about how it might be cognitively perceived.   
- Josh had concerns that weren't related to the hint text or info components.  He was more concerned about the headings
- Danielle had thoughts about separating personal from healthcare-related information
- This provides an opportunity for having a single info text component
- Christina also met with Shawna to discuss whether they'd had an instance of having two hint text components together.
- This is not an easy problem to solve considering design system constraints
- Christina tried to mock this up for mobile and there is too much copy.  Hint text really should be a line or so.  Not sure how this is going to work with the content we have.
- We have to be careful with the Healthcare info heading, because it can suggest that info is only used by VHA.
- Testing question - did people have confusion about preferred name and pronouns?  Do we even need hint text for preferred name and pronouns? 
	 - Yes, there were questions and confusion.
- Can we say "Click button below to add pronouns" instead of "Edit your profile to addâ€¦."
   - Yes; Marci will create a ticket in the backlog to review the generic copy above edit buttons that we can apply to all fields ("Click Edit to add [field]").
- All the hint text can go into the drop down, and then talk with Danielle about just saying that this is optional. That way the hint text is still helpful and the full context is there if needed.
- Josh mentioned about the headings inside each box (might be span)

## Action items 
- Tighten up the copy
- Update hint text in the last two to say "optional"
- Include everything else in the drop downs
- Christina will include these changes in Danielle's request with specific replacement context
