# Personal information: Staging test-users

## Blank state

Constraint(s):

- Should ALWAYS stay blank-state
- Do NOT Add Preferred name or Gender identity &mdash; use ONLY for checking blank-state content/styling.

## Successful add

- Starts in Blank-state
- Can ONLY test ONCE &mdash; gets "burnt" after successful Add
