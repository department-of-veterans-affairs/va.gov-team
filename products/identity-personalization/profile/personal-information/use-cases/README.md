## Current experience
- The following user information is on the page:
   - Read only information
     - Legal name
     - Date of birth
     - Disability rating
  - Editable information
     - Preferred name
        - Note: Once added there is no way to delete a preferred name. This is a future feature VA Profile is working on.
     - Messages signature (MHV)
        - Note: Only shows for those with VA health care.
- For all of these use cases, the user must be LOA3 (identity verified). If the user is not LOA3, the user will be directed to the Profile Account Security section.



## Common use cases
### User logs in with LOA3 account
#### Editing Preferred name and Messages signature sections
