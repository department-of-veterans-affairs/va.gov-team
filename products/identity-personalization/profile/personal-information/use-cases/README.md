# Personal Information Use Cases

**Last updated:** February 15, 2024

For all of these use cases, the user must be LOA3 (identity verified). If the user is not LOA3, the only thing they can access in profile is the Account Security section.

## Common use cases
### User logs in with LOA1 account
- [User logs in with an LOA1 account](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/use-cases/loa1-user.md)

### User logs in with LOA3 account
- [User needs to add or edit personal information (Preferred name or Gender identity)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/personal-information/use-cases/add-edit-personal-info.md)

## Edge cases

### Flags
There are no direct flags associated with this feature. However indirectly, if a user's account is flagged they will be unable to see this section of the profile.
