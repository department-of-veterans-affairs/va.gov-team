# Profile alert improvements

**Last updated:** 11/08/21

**Status:** pending content review in [#30265](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/30265)

## Background

We've got a variety of alert styles and content patterns throughout profile. In [#25820](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/25820), we conducted an audit of alerts to identify opportunities to improve consistency. This document captures the recommendations that came out of the audit and collaboration with the content team.
