Letters has affected date for permanent and total disability- dashboard?
- is there a letter that shows total disability?
- Benefit Verification Letter showed effective date
- Missing a more recent military history
- Did not see his date that he received 100% disability rating

^”Effective date for total and permanent disability, really important. That one date, most veterans would need”
- a lot of benefits use that date to determine state benefits

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thank you for joining us today! My name is Samara, and I also have some colleagues on the line observing. Today we're going to have you try out new tools to help you see important updates and manage your benefits and information on the site. 

Before we start, there are a few things I'd like to mention:

- We aren’t trying to sell or promote any product or service to you.   
- During this session, we’ll ask you to sign in to Vets.gov username and password and access the new tools. We will not be able to see or record your password. We won't ask you to share your screen until after you've logged in to Vets.gov.
- When your account is on the screen, we will ask you to confirm that you're seeing your correct information. This will help us to make sure everything's working the way it should. Please know that we are not recording today's session, so your personally identifiable information will not be shared. 
- We will be asking you to interact with the new tools, but nothing we do today will change anything about your account or your benefits. 
- There are no right or wrong answers. I won’t be offended by any opinions you express. 
- This entire session should take about 15 – 20 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally interrupt you to move on to the next question.
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. 

Does that all make sense, and sound okay to you?

Great! Any questions before we get started?

## Login

- What browser are you using?
