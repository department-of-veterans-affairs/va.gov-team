# Profile: potential research

This document serves to capture smaller updates we've made to profile that don't warrant their own research study, but should be evaluated as we have the opportunity in larger studies.

## Profile menu design update + unsticking

- **Release date**: menu design was launched in 2020; menu was unstuck 4/1/2021
- **Impacted pages:** all of profile
- **Device:** mobile
- GH issue [19779](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/19779)

### Research questions

- Do people see the profile menu with the new design? People didn't see this with the earlier design in the first study.
- Do people encounter usability issues having to get back up to the profile menu? (e.g. do we need the back to top component in profile)
- Are any other UX hurdles encountered since the menu is no longer sticky?
