# Executive Summary

## Overview

The VA.gov profile (https://www.va.gov/profile) aims to answer the question — "What does the VA know about me?"

Currently, the VA.gov profile houses people's:

- Personal information
- Contact information
- Military information
- Direct deposit information (comp & pen only)

With the [2020 Profile 2.0 redesign](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/Combine%20Profile%20and%20Account/README.md), the profile will also house "account" information.

## Products/Projects

The profile is a section of VA.gov that houses multiple products/features. Below is a list of different profile-related projects/products that we've worked on. Please use these outlines to get a sense for the individual details for each effort, including OKRs & KPIs:
