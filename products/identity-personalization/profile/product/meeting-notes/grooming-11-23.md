## Grooming Notes from 11/23

1. #49963 -  Fiduciary flag covers incompetent, deceased, or fiduciary flags that blocks the profile from the user. If we want analytics to track this, it's not possible right now. But we could check if the vet is flagged as incompetent, deceased, or fiduciary. We are not sure what the difference is between incompetent and fiduciary - **Sharon will confirm with Samara if is ok to track these scenarios separately since we canâ€™t track them as just one flag.** We may want to come up with a term for when a profile is blocked, (fiduciary does not seem to cover all these scenarios).
2. #49843 - Remove this and combine it with #46195 since John will be working on updating TTY code anyway, John will let us know in the comments if he finds any additional locations where the #800 is being used
3. Main focus this next sprint is on documentation as we want that wrapped up as much as possible before the end of the contract (12/16)
4. There are small differences among the various alerts within Profile, we should consider standardizing these eventually. This would be much easier for dev and design as well as create consistency across Profile. EX: the alert on Account Security says "We're here Monday-Friday 8am-8pm" but other alerts state "We're here Monday through Friday 8a-8p." **Update design ticket about account security alert to include working with FE on making the alerts consistent.**
5. #49835 - Need more clarification on this ticket, it does not say which specific alerts it applies to. **Sharon to check with Samara to see if this should be applied to all military info alerts or only some and if some, which ones?**
