## Grooming
### November 9, 2022

- [#49468](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/49468) - Groomed, Add to next sprint
- [#47721](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/47721) - In testing when there was an error and Angela tried to view it there were issues trying to view multiple errors, but Adam couldn’t replicate this. Adam isn’t sure where this ticket stands because he couldn’t replicate it. Adam wants to know if we should focus on the first error or if we even want an update button. This may need to be combined with the ticket that is going to address multiple errors. Sharon to go back to accessibility and see if they can reproduce this error.
- [#46609](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/46609) - Need to open a new design ticket for this to determine best design options before proceeding with FE work. 
- [#19618](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/19618) - Test this the next time we do screen reader testing to see how big of an issue it is for people. 
- [#49436](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/49436) - Groomed
- **Should we start Notifications setting/mobile flow Epic with the contract ending?** Samara does not want us to start anything now that we do not think we can finish before the contract ends. Priorities for this team for the next two sprints are the accessibility work, fiduciary flag, DD214, or anything else that can be finished up before mid Dec. For now, we will pause the Notf settings/mobile flow work. 
- Adam believes there is enough FE work to get him and John through the next few sprints
