## Current experience
- The profile hub is the landing page for profile and shows cards for every section of the profile.
- For all of these use cases, the user must be LOA3 (identity verified). If the user is not LOA3, the user will be directed to the Profile Account Security section.


 
## Common use cases
### User logs in with LOA3 account
- **Use case:** If a LOA3 user navigates to profile they see a landing page with cards directing them to sections of the profile.
- **Status code:** 200
- **Format:** [Card component](https://design.va.gov/components/card)
