# Overview

**Dependents and contacts** is a sub page in profile that encompasses all the people associated with the user, such as dependents and their accredited representative or VSO.

# Experience 

* The **Dependents and contacts** page includes a link to the **Accredited representative or VSO** page in profile.  
  * A link to **Dependents on file** also exists on the page and links the user to the respective tool not in the profile.  
* Links appear in alphabetical order using the [Link \- Collection component](https://design.va.gov/components/link/collection).  
* The user must be LOA3 (identity verified) to see the page. If the user is not LOA3 verified, they will be directed to the **Sign-in information** page to verify their account.
