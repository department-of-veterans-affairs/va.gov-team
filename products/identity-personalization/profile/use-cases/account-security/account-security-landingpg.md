# Overview 

**Account security** is a sub page in profile that encompasses activities related to maintaining the users account security. Such as managing their sign-in information and connected applications.

# Experience 

* The **Account security** page includes links to the **Connected apps** and **Sign-in information** pages in profile.  
* Links appear in alphabetical order using the [Link \- Collection component](https://design.va.gov/components/link/collection).  
* The user must be LOA3 (identity verified) to see the page. If the user is not LOA3 verified, they will be directed to the **Sign-in information** page to verify their account.
