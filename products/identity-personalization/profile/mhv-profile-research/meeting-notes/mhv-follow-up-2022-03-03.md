# My HealtheVet Profile Follow Up

 ## Attendees

- Liz Lantz (host)
- Lexi Wunder
- Arienne Walters
- Samara Strauss
- Marci McGuire

 ## Notes

- They will be pulling data from MPI, but some fields like Marital Status may be removed because they aren't shared and aren't necessary for health care
- What are the plans for other info on MHV?  (Emergency info, My Links, etc)
	- They are trying to structure so it's the same as VA.gov
	- As far as emergency contacts, they don't see that going away any time soon
	- They need to do research to see if people use My Links
	- They are trying to get the bigger picture approved by the stakeholders (interim solution, not the long-term vision)
	- Will need to happen this year
- Any sense of the order for the approach?
	- They are trying to do what they can before the merge - -asking which email they prefer
	- Probably move things/restructure so they match with VA.gov profile starting with new users
- Notification Center design needs to come before the convergence design
	- One of the stakeholder was concerned about all the things happening on MHV this year, and concerned about alerts everywhere.  They would like to use the Notification Center to let them know about the notifications.  
- Are they doing notifications AND banner-type alerts?
	- They want to get away from the banners, use the Notification Center, and also looking into secure messaging
- MHV stakeholders may not want to align as much as VA.gov, so that's a concern
- They can share their mockups with us
- Any other plans about sunsetting the personal info on MHV?
	- Nothing we haven't already talked about
- Any research that we can look at? 
	- Lexi has some -- posted [link](https://xd.adobe.com/view/c27259c3-4f5f-429c-9107-b5461bb9647e-9721/screen/6176d1f9-fea3-4362-bb48-828515a002b4) in Slack
	- Auth team did research on Preferred Facility
	- They want to do more research to see if there's a possibility to remove or structure it a little better so Veterans understand it
	- They are reorganizing their research info into SharePoint from Confluence, but can give us what they have, but we may not have access to all.  
	- If they can export as PDF, that will be helpful
	- Liz don't want to ask things they've already covered, and can possibly fill gaps in their research
- Any broad findings about how people use the Profile?
	- From what they know, they only go in there when they have to.
	- A lot of it is not organized so that they intuitively know to go there for things like notifications.  They are hoping that re-structuring the navigation and IA, it will feel more familiar.
	- Lexi found a presentation from their first profile integration - XD file - sent to [Slack](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C03557TUK62/p1646344352939639)
- Questions about the Admin Portal
	- Arienne and Liz have a thread going about data points. Question Liz had for MJ was if there was any data from the admin portal that would help us understand how they use it
	- There are different users of Admin Portal - help desk, VISN coordinator, Facility coordinator, more administrative users who can assign roles to people
	- Research they did was more around that design
	- How do coordinators use the data in the profile to help Veterans?  
		- They don't look at the front end side, but sometimes have to guide users there over the phone or chat
		- Looks completely different from the MHV front-end, but has the same data points
		- A lot of the things on there is used to identify the Veteran over the  phone, so that's why some  things are more important than others
		- They can do things like reset passwords, but can't change personal info -- has to be done by the Veteran at a facility
		- Whatever is pulled from MPI now is pulled from MPI there too.
		- It has middle name, suffix, etc
		- Do they propose removing those from the front end? Yes, and the portal too.
		- Liz wants to avoid recommending removing things that are needed by administrators
		- Arienne things everything they are proposing to remove is not vital verifying identiy
		- Help Desk deal with Veterans primarily
		- VISN and Facility coordinators do admin portal tasks.  Other than that, they assign roles.  VISN coordinators oversee Facility coordinators.  They can add things to the calendar like Covid vaccination.  They also do role assignment
		- Upper level Help Desk person can deactivate accounts
		- Coordinators would only deal directly with Veterans in person or on a video call
		- Sylvia was the contact for that, but she has changed positions.  She was their contact for the Help Desk
		- HRC is the contact center.  We probably should interview two different levels because they have access to two different things
- Arienne has a list of roles and what they have access to - posted [link](https://dsva.slack.com/files/UP23SB8BX/F0355CRALMD/admin-portal-jobs-and-roles.pdf) in Slack
