## Problem Statement

MyHealtheVet has its own profile, which is part of a larger Personal Information section. In support of the health apartment transition into VA.gov, we need to figure out which parts of the MHV Profile and Personal Information section need to roll into VA.gov and put together a strategy for how we might go about that work. 

## Research goals

Our ultimate goal is to come up with a strategy for how we should move forward with rolling the MHV profile into the VA.gov profile. In order to do this, we need to:

1. Evaluate the MHV profile and personal information section, noting similarities and differences with the VA.gov profile.
2. Work closely with the MHV profile team to understand the current status of profile work.
3. Understand MHV coordinator roles and how they use the MHV profile.
4. Determine if we need to talk to other MHV stakeholders, and have discussions as necessary.
5. Understand how MHV users use the profile, and what they need from the VA.gov profile in order to make it work for them.

## Research deliverables

We plan to deliver a report on all of our findings, including high-level recommendations around how both MHV and VA.gov should handle the profile transition.

## Solution approach

In order for this research effort to be successful, we should do all of the following:

- An MHV profile/Personal Information section evaluation.
- Get analytics on MHV if we can.
- Talk to:
  - The MHV profile team.
  - MHV coordinators.
  - Other MHV stakeholders, if necessary.
  - MHV users.

## Questions to answer

### About the profile/Personal Information section

- What data do we already have in the VA.gov profile that is also part of the MHV profile?
- What data do we not already have in the VA.gov profile that should move over from MHV?
- What data do we not already have in the VA.gov profile that should *not* move over from MHV?
- Are there other sections of the "Personal Information" section of MHV that we need to account for in the profile?

### For the VA.gov identity team

- Will we need to support the MHV credential after the health apartment transition? 

### For MHV profile team

- What work is the MHV profile team already doing to start to get their profile data into VA Profile or other backends?
- What work has the MHV profile team already done to start planning for the eventual transition over to VA.gov? Have they started talking about sunsetting the MHV profile
- What does the MHV profile team know about how their users use the profile?
- Do they have analytics that we can look at?

### For MHV coordinators

- Are there data points that are used by MHV coordinators in the profile?
- What are the expectations around what access MHV coordinators will have to VA.gov profile data once we fully make this transition?
- How can we make this transition less painful for them?

### For MHV stakeholders

- What expectations do they have around the MHV --> VA.gov profile transition?
- What are the expectations around what access MHV coordinators will have to VA.gov profile data once we fully make this transition?

### For MHV users

- How do they use their profiles? Are there fields that are regularly used and others that are not?
- How can we make this transition less painful for them?
