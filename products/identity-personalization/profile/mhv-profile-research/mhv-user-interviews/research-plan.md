# # Research Plan for MHV personal information, Veteran interviews, March 2022
`draft`
## Background
MyHealtheVet (MHV) has its own profile, which is part of a larger Personal Information section. In support of the health apartment transition, we need to understand how Veterans currently use this part of MHV in order to inform our approach to aligning the MHV profile with the VA.gov profile.

### OCTO Objectives 
This research supports these OCTO objectives:
1. Increase the usage and throughput of VA services
2. Increase the quality and reliability of VA services

## Research Goals	
Through this research, we’d like to understand:
1. How MHV users use the profile
2. How MHV users use the rest of the personal information sections
3.What MHV users need from the VA.gov profile in order to make it work for them.

### Outcome
Our ultimate goal is to come up with a strategy for how we should move forward with rolling the MHV profile into the VA.gov profile.  Our findings from this research will inform our strategy.

### Research questions
1. How do Veterans use the “My VA Treating Facility fields”?
2. How do Veterans use the “My relationship with the VA field?”
3. Which sections of MHV’s “Personal Information”
