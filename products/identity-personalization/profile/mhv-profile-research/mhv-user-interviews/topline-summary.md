This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.
*The goal of this document is:*
* To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
* To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
* To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

## Initial Findings

### The sections of MHV Personal Information users find most useful are: Download my data, In case of Emergency, Change password, and My VA.gov Profile.
We started the session asking users to tell us about how they’ve used the personal information section.  6 of the 11 participants talked about using the following features. They were not the same 6 for each feature.
- Change password
- Download my data
- In case of emergency

Only 1 participant had a profile with only required fields filled out; the majority stated that while they don’t regularly visit the profile page, they had used it in the past to make updates. The most common reasons people had for visiting My VA.gov Profile were managing email notifications and changing their account security questions.

### People expect that VA has access to all the information in their profile, updates made in their profile would be available to VA and have some kind of downstream effect.

A resounding theme across all the data points discussed with participants was that they expected that VA has access to the information they entered into MHV, especially in their profile.  Only one participant expressed doubts about the VA having access to their MHV personal information section; this came up most frequently when we asked who could see the emergency contact information.
> The doctor, clergy, it’ll be a small group of people who can actually see it - my point of contact. It should be in my records. If I’m not conscious, and can’t say who I am. - P11

Participants also talked about the VA being notified about updates made to  sections of their profile, such as a change to their My VA Treating Facility section, and that they expected those updates would kick off a change on the administrative side of VA.
> I would assume I get e-mailed saying that something changed, and that information would go to the VA center too. - P13

### People had varying ideas and levels of confidence about how data for “What is your relationship to VA” or “My VA treating facilites” is used by VA.

Our team has outstanding questions about these fields so we felt it was important to learn about the user’s understanding of them before we continue to dig in with stakeholders.  No participants were overly confused or bothered by the presence of these fields, but no one had a clear idea on what they were used for or felt they were useful for them to be able to change.

> It shows me that I am a veteran. Other than that I am not sure how it helps me. - P13

Participants speculated that the “What is your relationship to VA” checkboxes were there for a variety of reasons:
- Secondary insurance billing.
- Understanding which VA newsletters a person may be interested in.
- Verification purposes.
- To provide services at a VAMC.
- To know whether or not someone is a Caregiver using a Veteran’s account.
- A tag so the VA can use caution with who they are dealing with.

Responses were slightly more consistent - related to records - when talking about the purpose of the “My VA Treating Facilities” checkboxes, but still varied. 

Our participants guessed that the checkboxes meant:
- These are where VA *could* have your medical records
- This is where medical records will be transferred if you select an option
- This is simply an acknowledgement that a Veteran goes to this facility.
- This affects where a Veteran can receive care.
- This tells VA what market a Veteran is in (where receiving care).
- Unchecking and saving will discontinue service at these facilities.
- These are to update which facility records a Veteran can see in their blue button report.

It’s not clear to users what these data points are for, and users don’t immediately find them useful in their current state.

### It’s important to Veterans to be able to identify and manage emergency contact information. 

6 of the 11 participants had previously gone in and updated their emergency contact information, and all spoke to the importance of being able to do this during the session. It was surprising to many that the emergency contact information in MHV was not viewable by VA in an emergency situation.

### Only 1 of 11 participants had ever used their printable health information card (HIC). 

Most participants had never used their HIC card; some thought it was the same thing as their Veteran Health Identification Card (used during appointment check-in) until they carefully reviewed it. 

After learning about it, 4 participants thought it would be something they would use.  The remaining participants didn’t see value in the card since most information is on their phone, or because they didn’t believe emergency responders would go through their wallet to figure out who to call.

### All participants had never used My Links; 3 of 11 thought they might now that they knew about it.

Upon initial review, the majority of participants focused on the level 2 heading containing the word “journal” and misunderstood the page to be a place to enter information about their health, such as blood pressure. Once they looked more close and realized this was a bookmarking tool, they didn’t see a usefulness for this feature. 

> I would probably just bookmark in my browser. Don’t know that I’d save it here. - P7

### There were some topics Veterans felt had overlap between healthcare and profile.
We conducted a card sort after the interview portion of our session. The cards contained health care and profile items, and participants could sort them into 3 categories (as well as create their own). The categories were:
- Your VA.gov Profile
- Your healthcare
- Not important to me

The cards below had nearly equal or equal agreement between the “My health care” and “My VA.gov profile” categories.
- Your caregivers
- Notification settings for prescription shipping updates
- Your blood type

We also want to call out that 5 of 11 participants placed “Notification settings for the MHV newsletter” into the health care category (the rest had low agreement between profile and participant created categories). 

It may be helpful for Veterans to have content related to these categories cross-linked between the health apartment  and profile, or surfaced in multiple places.

### MHV users are used to being able to change their password and manage account access via security questions.
Almost all participants mentioned changing their password, updating security questions, or doing both.   This tells us they’ll likely expect to have some sort of agency over the security of their account, even after we stop supporting the MHV credential.  We may need to provide some additional information or onboarding about managing account security to help users transition to managing information on VA.gov.

### For the most part, participants expected to find health related information in their profile.



| Card | Category |
|---|---|
|A list of VA facilities where you receive health care | My Health Care |
|A list of apps you’ve chosen that share information from your VA.gov profile and health record (apps like Apple Health) | My Health Care |
| Emergency contacts | My VA.gov Profile |
| Next of kin | My VA.gov Profile |
| Notification settings for prescription shipping updates | My VA.gov Profile |
| Notification settings for the MHV newsletter | My Health Care |
| Printable wallet health information card | My VA.gov Profile |
| The ability to connect your health tracking device (like a FitBit) | My Health Care |
| Your blood type | My Health Care |
| Your caregivers | My Health Care |
| Your non-VA health insurance information | My VA.gov Profile |
| Your power of attorney | My VA.gov Profile |
| Your providers and doctors (self-entered) | My VA.gov Profile |

## Additional findings
### Participants expect to be able to update their mailing address in their profile; if they’re not able to, the majority would call VA to make that change.

We asked participants where they would go to update their prescription shipping mailing address if they had moved; all participants expected to find a place to do this in their profile. Upon realizing the address field was not there, participants said they’d do it over the phone. Who they would call varied by participant:
- VA help desk
- Their VAMC pharmacy
- The VA eligibility office



### The participants who receive care at multiple facilities have not experienced challenges related to being registered at multiple VAMCs.

We did some research in June 2021 to explore the value of adding preferred facilites to the VA.gov profile. Our findings in that study shows the ability of simply selecting a preferred or current facility from a list of registered facilities was not a useful feature to Veterans. 

In this round of research, we recruited participants who had been to multiple facilites in the last 18 months to validate those findings now that we’re planning for this transition.

Of the participants that had more than one facility listed (about half): 
- all used secure messaging
- none used VAOS to schedule appointments (only cancel)
- some used Rx refills. 
- all stated they did not have problems with any online tools related to having to choose a facility.

The ability to select or deselect a facility seemed invaluable to some participants, at least based on what they could understand from the UI:

> ”I don’t think a list of VA facilities is important, because I already don’t think they can communicate between themselves, and I am confident that I can walk into a facility anywhere in the world, and I can be treated.” - P10

### Some participants shared how the ability to select a facility could be valuable to them:
> It’d be more helpful to see it at the clinic level. Maybe be able to click on each one and open up what I’ve done there and the records to sort my information based on what doctors you’ve seen. - P1

> I am thinking maybe it needs a few more options to check. Perhaps a pull down list of the different VAs. In case, lets say, you are at a conference for a week and need the VA in Iowa City…I am from Georgia, and I am in Atlanta, I would want to go to the VA with no issues - P15

Many participants in our previous study spoke to the value of being able to select and save facilities for travel purposes; this is something we should keep in mind as we consider how a facility-related feature could serve Veterans.
