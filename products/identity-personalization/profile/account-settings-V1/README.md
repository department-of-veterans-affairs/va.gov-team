## Overview
- The Account is the single source of truth for customer-facing user-settings information.

## User Problem Statement
_"As a veteran, I want to see the current status of my account with the VA, and make any changes necessary to access services on the site"_

- There is no one central location for veterans to see and change the status of account relevant information that impacts access to tools on the site and security of their accounts.
   - these items include
      1. Identity proofing
      2. Two factor authentication (2FA)
      3. Terms and Conditions of the website (t&c)

### User Goal
- Allows the Veteran to manage user-settings related to identity, security, and interaction with the VA.

## The Plan
- Implement a straightforward, easy to use, best in class account page
- Consolidate access for the tools above into one, easy to use UI

## Solution approach
1. V1 - The first version of the account will give the veteran access to identity proofing, 2FA, and t&c.
