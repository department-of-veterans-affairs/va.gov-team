## Overview

The profile hub serves as a landing page for the VA.gov Profile. It allows users to easily scan all sections of the profile without obfuscating this information behind a menu. 

## Problem statement

- As a mobile user, I can easily miss the mobile menu in the profile, which leads me to think that `Personal information` is the only section of the profile.
- As a person using a screen reader, I expect to see a `Profile` H1 when I go to the profile.

## User Outcomes

### Desired User Outcomes

*Why would a user want to use this? With this problem solved, what should users be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*

- On mobile, users can more easily scan for what is available in the profile.
- For people using screen readers, it will be much clearer that links to `Profile` landed them in the right place.

### Undesired User Outcomes

- Done wrong, the hub could become noisy, cluttered place that makes it harder for users to easily navigate to tools.

## Business Outcomes

### Desired Business Outcomes

*Why would your business want this to exist? With this problem solved, what should your business be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*

- This allows us to fix longstanding issues for mobile and screen reader users.
- This allows us to surface links associated with the profile without having to build whole new sections within the profile.
- This allows us to experiment with the hub model and whether it might be part of a more holistic authenticated experience. 

### Undesired Business Outcomes

- The hub becomes a dumping ground.

## Analytics

(TBD what to do with analytics based on outcome of usability research)
- We need new tracking for GA on the profile menu
- Reduce Search Terms for Profile Items w/in the Profile
