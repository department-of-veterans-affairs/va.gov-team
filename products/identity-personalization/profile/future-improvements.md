###  Ideas for Profile improvements

- Better communication of success and error messages, something more mobile friendly. More actionable error messages. Is "please try again" useful?
- Re-examine borders on tables and how we're handling that. Are they necessary? We need padding if we have borders and this takes up precious real estate on small screens
- Can profile be smart enough to inform people of relevant things when they're making edits (e.g. tell people their prescriptions will go to this new address when they're making changes to the address field and we know they have prescriptions)
- ~Move edit button to bottom left corner of "cards". Current placement is problematic for instances where we have a list of things to edit (e.g notifications), and for folks zoomed in~ completed July 2021
