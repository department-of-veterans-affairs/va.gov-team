# Conversation guide for Authenticated Experience, Profile completion, Summer 2024

## Task 1: Learn how Veterans think about providing contact information to VA - 3 minutes

Thanks for everything you’ve shared so far.  Next, I’m going to show you an idea we’d like to get your feedback on. This is a prototype, not a real VA website, so even though things are clickable, they don’t really go anywhere or do much.  There will be some things that look clickable but won’t do anything.  As you look through it, it’ll be super helpful if you can think out loud as much as possible.

I’ll can go ahead and send the link through the chat. *Guide participant if necessary*

*Send participant to [profile hub](https://cdpn.io/pen/debug/OJYxMLK) or [contact information page with alert](https://cdpn.io/pen/debug/BaewjZo)*, *depending on what makes most sense based on the rest of the session*

Ok, I can see the prototype on your screen. Don’t click on anything yet, but talk to me about what you see on this page.
- *If they don’t mention the alert, prompt them:* What stands out to you here?
  Do you think it’s important for VA to have your current contact information on file? 
- Why?
  - *If needed, prompt:* Tell me what you think the benefits are of sharing current contact information with VA.
- Is there any contact information you wouldn’t want VA to have? Talk to me about that.

## Task 2: Evaluate effectiveness of entry point - 1 minute
Thanks for sharing all of that.  Now, imagine this was your profile on the website, tell me what you would do from here? 
- *If participant says they’d click on the alert, tell them to go ahead*
- *If participant says anything else, ask why that thing, and then guide them to click on the alert*

## Task 3: Evaluate step 0 -2 of flow - 5 minutes
*Participant should be on [https://cdpn.io/pen/debug/xxNXZzQ](https://cdpn.io/pen/debug/xxNXZzQ)*

Go ahead and take a look at this page, and tell me what you make of it. Don’t click on anything yet, but I’m curious to know what you’d do from here.
- Based on what you see here, are you required to provide this information?  
- What would you expect to happen if you clicked on “remind me later”?  
  - When should “later” be? 
  - How would you expect to be reminded?

Thanks for that. Now you can click on things as you normally would, and please remember to think out loud as much as possible so I can understand how this works for you. *If needed, instruct participant to click on action link.* 

*When participant is on step one:*
Since this is a prototype, none of these fields will save any of your information. You can enter anything you’d like, it doesn’t have to be your actual contact information.

- *Allow participant to go through the flow. As needed, ask:*
  - What do you expect will happen if you choose the “skip this” checkbox?
  - How do you know how much effort you’re going to have to put into this? (Trying to evaluate if they notice and understand  `Step X of X` heading)
### Things to note
- What did the participant expect from “skip this?
- What did the participant expect from “remind me later”?
- Was anything unclear or confusing?
## Task 4: Evaluate dismissing workflow and remind me later - 2 minutes
*Pause participant on step 3*
- If you changed your mind and wanted to get out of this workflow, would the email and phone number be saved to your profile?
- What would you do to get out of this workflow?
- What do you expect will happen if you choose “remind me later” instead of finishing?

Things to note
- What did the participant expect from “skip this?
- What did the participant expect from “remind me later”?
- Did they understand that any information previously entered would be saved to their profile if they exited?

## Post-task interview - 3 min
*Ask while on confirmation screen*
Thanks for going through that. I’m curious about a couple of things:
- Overall, what did you think about that process? 
- Can you think of any other ways to get that info that would have worked better for you?
- Was anything unclear or confusing?
- If you were logged into the website and had gone through that, what would you do next from here?
