# NoK/EC Research sync

10/2/2023

Attendees: Jonathan Nelson, Pam Drouin, Liz Lantz

## Meeting goals
1. Figure out how we want to approach research. 
2. Figure out who will do what for this research study.

## Summary
- We all agree Nok/EC should be it’s own page rather than nested within Contact Information
- We should consider what is our hypothesis for this as it’s own navigation item/page
  - what that will do long term to the profile
  - Eventually, we will need to consider some chunking but this is not the push over the edge
- Jonathan will lead research efforts
 
## Research approach
### Research questions
#### From research team
   - Is it clear that these contacts only pertain to health care?
   - Where do people go to find this information (findability)?
     - We don’t want to duplicate existing research
     - Is it intuitive to find it in the profile?
   - How is the “read only” data useful to Veterans?
   - Is it clear to people how they can update the information?
   - How many NoK/EC do people want to list?
   - What information about NoK/EC do people expect to need to provide?

#### From other team members

### Research method
   - Combo usability/interview session
   - Test on production behind a feature flag assuming the APIs can be hooked up
   - If APIs can’t be hooked up, then we can test on staging
### Roles
   - Jonathan will lead the research study
   - Liz and Pam to provide external support

## Next steps
1. Review “Personal health care contacts” as the section title, and as a result the URL with CAIA
2. Get alignment from CAIA on “wait and see IA approach and putting it under Contact information (since it’s related to contacts)
3. Jonathan to
