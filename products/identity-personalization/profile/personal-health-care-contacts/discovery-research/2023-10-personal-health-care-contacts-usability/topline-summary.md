This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered. 

**The goal of this document is:**

 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

## Initial Findings

### Most participants looked for _Medical emergency contact_ and _Next of kin contact_ in the Profile section of VA.go 
- I have to look into this as some mentioned MHV, etc

### Participants expected or wanted a way to edit or add both _Medical emergency contact_ and _Next of kin contact_ information on the _Personal health care contacts_ page. 

- All 9 participants expected or wanted this functionality (have to be verified). 

### Most (all?) participants wanted at least two _Medical emergency contacts_ listed (primary and secondary). 
- Participants wanted multiple _Emergency contacts_ listed in case the primary contact was not available.

### Some (Have to check this) participants wanted at least two _Next of kin_ listed. (Is this true?) 

### Most participants wanted functionally to prioritize multiple _Medical emergency contacts_ and _Next of kin_ contacts. 

### (Most) Participants wanted "relationship" listed as well as "Home and Mobile" phone numbers. 

### It was clear to participants that both _Medical Emergency contact_ and _Next of kin contact_ are related only to health care. 

### Participants expect all the information that the VA has on file to be displayed on the Personal health care contacts page (is that true?) 

### "Medical" in _Medical emergency contact_ caused some confusion with participants. However, all participants understood the term _Emergency contact_. 

- At least one participant thought _Medical emergency contact_ was a contact he (or a doctor) would reach out to if he had an emergency.
