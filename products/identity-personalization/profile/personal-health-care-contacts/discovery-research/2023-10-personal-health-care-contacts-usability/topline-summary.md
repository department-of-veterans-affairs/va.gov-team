This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered. 

**The goal of this document is:**

 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

## Initial Findings

### Participants found little difference between editing contact information on one page compared to separate pages; both approaches were easily understood and usable.

- Of the 10 participants we asked, only 2 noticed they were going to a new URL in the prototype and stayed on one page on the website. No one commented on this without being prompted.
- Once it was pointed out, 3 participants shared concerns about bandwidth loading a new page for each edit.
- When discussing differences between the two approaches, 8 of 10 participants stated they preferred to stay on one page. One participant who preferred the multi-page approach said it was because there were no alerts, which was only due to the fact that it was a prototype.

> It didn’t make a difference that it went to another page because my focus was just on updating the information. - P1

### Most participants found all the alerts and modals they encountered to be useful.
- No participants were bothered or slowed down by encountering these alerts as they updated contact information.
- Many commented they were helpful and would prevent a mistake.
- Some participants moved too quickly to read the content in the alerts.

### The notification settings interface was intuitive for most participants, but the user flow and notification labels were confusing.

- All but 2 participants understood the radio button options and that their update saved without clicking a button.
	- One participant landed on the page and was immediately confused by the lack of a button, and that a radio button was already selected.
	- A screen reader participant expected a checkbox instead of a radio button and did not realize there were 2 options until prompted to look more.
- The process of adding a mobile number and then updating notification settings was not intuitive for most participants. 
	- Many missed the “manage text notifications” link in the confirmation box and weren’t sure how to get back without guidance.
	- Some thought by adding a mobile number, they had updated their notification settings and had completed the process.

> That little piece that says, “go ahead and update notifications now” -  it just totally went right past me. I totally just missed it. - P1

- A few participants missed the “Board of Veterans’ Appeals hearing reminder” label, and thought the notification was about Applications, Claims, and Decision Reviews

> Once I [update my setting], I can receive notifications on applications claims, decisions, and appeals. 


### The address validation flow was easily understood by most participants, even when immediately followed by the “match mailing to home address” modal.

- All participants understood the content in the alert, though not all participants commented on the edit buttons in the alert. 
- One participant was confused about how to go back and edit the address they had entered. 
- A few participants encountered the address validation flow, followed other alerts or modals. It didn’t faze them.


### Additional findings not tied to our research goals
- Some participant felt the font was small
> Well, no, everything is blurry when I take off my glasses and my magnifier away. So it just takes me a minute to to do it, because the the font is so small - P1
