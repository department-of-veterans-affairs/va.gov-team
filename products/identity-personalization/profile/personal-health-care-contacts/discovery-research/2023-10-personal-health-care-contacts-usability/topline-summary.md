This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered. 

**The goal of this document is:**

 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

## Initial Findings

Note: We'll double check the exact numbers for each of these findings during final synthesis

### Most participants looked for _Medical emergency contact_ and _Next of kin contact_ in their profile
- The majority of these participants talked about their profile on VA.gov
- A couple mentioned their My HealtheVet profile

### Participants expected or wanted a way to edit or add both _Medical emergency contact_ and _Next of kin contact_ information on the _Personal health care contacts_ page. 
- All 9 participants expected or wanted this functionality 

### Most participants wanted at least two _Medical emergency contacts_.
- Participants wanted multiple contacts listed in case the primary contact was not available.

### Most participants wanted at least two _Next of kin_ listed.
- One participant toward the end felt one would be sufficient

### Most participants wanted functionally to prioritize multiple _Medical emergency contacts_ and _Next of kin_ contacts. 

### (Most) Participants wanted "relationship" listed as well as "Home and Mobile" phone numbers. 
- People specifically talked about the importance of adding these data points so the VA would have more context when reaching out to the person.
- One participant brought up the importance of labeling a home phone so that no one would accidentally try to send a text message to that number.

### It was clear to participants that both _Medical Emergency contact_ and _Next of kin contact_ are related only to health care. 

### At least 2 participants expected all the information that the VA has on file about emergency contacts and next of kin to be displayed on the Personal health care contacts page

### "Medical" in _Medical emergency contact_ caused some confusion with participants. However, all participants understood the term _Emergency contact_. 

- At least two participants thought _Medical emergency contact_ was a contact they could reach out to if they had an emergency and needed assistance right away, similar to 911.
