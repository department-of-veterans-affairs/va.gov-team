## Research Goals

The purpose of this research is to assess users' understanding, reactions, and expectations to the proposed Emergency contact and Next of kin feature within the VA.gov profile.

Evaluate how easily users are able to find this information.
Evaluate if the proposed designs are understandable and useful across participant types (sighted and low/no vision) and screen sizes (mobile and desktop).

## Research Questions
1. Are users able to navigate to the Emergency contact and Next of kin information from an unauthenticated state?
 
	- Is it intuitive to find this information within VA.gov profile?

2. What are users' reactions to and understanding of the proposed designs? 

	- Is it clear that the “Personal health care contacts” only pertain to health care? 
	- Is it clear to users how to update their information? 
	- Do participants understand what is meant by “Next of kin” information? 

3. What is the user mental model around Emergency contact and Next of kin information? 
	- How do veterans define emergency contact and next of kin?
	- How is the “read only” data useful to Veterans?
	- How many Emergency contacts and Next of kin contacts do people want/expect to list/see?'
	- When or where do people expect to be asked about this information? 	
	- What type of information for both Emergency contact and Next of kin do users expect to need to provide?


## Methodology 
We conducted remote usability and interview sessions with Zoom. The interviews consisted of a combination of tasks and direct questions. We conducted the study in the staging environment, with a test user created specifically for the purpose of this study.

## Hypotheses and Conclusions
_Hypothesis 1:_ Participants will sign in, go to the "Profile", then navigate to “Personal health care contacts” in order to view EC and NOK information.  

_Hypthesis 2:_ Participants will understand the EC and NOK information and understand how to update information. 

_Hypthesis 3:_ Participants will want to be able to edit or add EC and NOK information in place. 

## Key Findings
1. 

## Details of Findings 
### 1) 9 of 11 participants were able to update a VA.gov profile with in-line editing with relative ease.

We started our sessions by asking participants to update sections on the contact information page. All participants intuitively understood how to go from “read-only” to “edit” mode, to complete forms, and to save their changes. 

All but 1 participant easily navigated the longer address form. The 1 participant who did not had mistakenly checked the “I live on a United States military base” without realizing it and got  confused by the corresponding form fields.

Notably, the “alert followed by a modal” pattern that can occur in a couple of edge-case flows did not cause confusion or prevent any participant from successfully completing their task.
