## Research Goals

The purpose of this research is to assess users' understanding, reactions, and expectations to the proposed Emergency contact and Next of kin feature within the VA.gov Profile. We wanted to achieve the specific goals of:

- Evaluating how easily users are able to find this information.
- Evaluating if the proposed designs are understandable and useful across participant types (sighted and low/no vision) and screen sizes (mobile and desktop).

## Research Questions
1. Are users able to navigate to the _Emergency contact_ and _Next of kin_ information from an unauthenticated state?
 
	- Is it intuitive to find this information within VA.gov Profile?

2. What are users' reactions to and understanding of the proposed designs? 

	- Is it clear that the _Personal health care contacts_ only pertain to health care? 
	- Is it clear to users how to update their information? 
	- Do participants understand what is meant by _Next of kin_ information? 

3. What is the user mental model around _Emergency contact_ and _Next of kin_ information? 
	- How do veterans define emergency contact and next of kin?
	- How is the “read only” data useful to Veterans?
	- How many _Emergency contacts_ and _Next of kin_ contacts do people want/expect to list/see?
	- When or where do people expect to be asked about this information? 	
	- What type of information for both _Emergency contact_ and _Next of kin_ do users expect to need to provide?


## Methodology 
We conducted remote usability and interview sessions with Zoom. The interviews consisted of a combination of tasks and direct questions. We conducted the study in the staging environment, with a test user created specifically for the purpose of this study.

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

**_Hypothesis 1:_** Participants will sign in, go to the VA.gov Profile, then navigate to _Personal health care contacts_ in order to view _Emergency contact_ and _Next of kin_ information.  

**True:** 
- Since most participants looked for this information within their VA.gov Profile (see findings 1 and 2).

**_Hypthesis 2:_** Participants will understand the _Emergency contact_ and _Next of kin_ information and understand how to update information. 

**Partially true:** 
- Participants understood the concept of _Emergency contact_ (see finding 3)
- Participants often conflated _Next of kin_ and _Emergency contact_ (see finding 4) but relied on the hint text to distinguish between the two concepts.
- Participants understood how to update information. 

**_Hypthesis 3:_** Participants will want to be able to edit or add _Emergency contact_ and _Next of kin_ information in place. 

**Definitely true:**
- All participants wanted functionality to edit and add contacts on the page (see finding 5). 

## Key Findings
1. Participants expected that they would need to sign in to VA.gov to review _Medical emergency contact_ and _Next of kin_ information, and most participants (6 of 9) looked within their profile.
2. Once on the Profile, the majority of participants were able to navigate to the _Personal health care contacts_ section of the Profile with relative ease.
3. Most participants (7 of 9) understood the concept of _Medical emergency contact_. "Medical" in _Medical emergency contact_ caused confusion with 2 participants. All participants understood the term _Emergency contact_.
4. Most participants (6 of 9) associated _Next of kin_ with family and initially did not differentiate between _Medical emergency contact_ and _Next of kin contact_.
5. Participants wanted a way to edit both _Medical emergency contact_ and _Next of kin contact_ information on the _Personal health care contacts_ page.
6. 6 of 8 participants found the information about how to update their _Personal health care contacts_ and understood the process.
7. 9 of 9 participants wanted at least two _Medical emergency contacts_ and most participants (7 of 9) wanted multiple _Next of kin_ contacts listed.
8. Participants considered "name" and "phone number(s)" as crucial information within both the _Medical emergency contact_ and _Next of kin contact_ sections.
9. Participants clearly understood that both the _Medical Emergency contact_ and _Next of kin contact_ were specifically associated with health care.

## Details of Findings 

### 1) Participants expected that they would need to sign in to VA.gov to review _Medical emergency contact_ and _Next of kin_ information, and most participants (6 of 9) looked within their profile.

When asked how a participant would ensure the VA has the correct information on file, all 9 participants were able to recognize and articulate how they would start that process by signing in. 

After signing in/or articulating that process: 

- 4 participants navigated directly to the Profile (sign in > Profile)
- 1 participant attempted to navigate to the My HealtheVet profile as they related this information to health (sign in > My HealtheVet) but at "second guess", this participant headed to the VA.gov Profile
- 1 participant explored the landing page and used the mega menu to navigate to the health care hub section. After, not finding what they were looking for, they went to Profile
- 3 participants attempted to search "emergency contact" or "next of kin" and were unable to find information and navigate to the Profile

---

### 2) Once on the Profile, the majority of participants were able to navigate to the _Personal health care contacts_ section of the Profile with relative ease.

6 of 7 participants went to the _Personal health care contacts_ to view their emergency contact and next of kin information (2 participants were having technical difficulty during this portion of the study). 1 participant went to the _Contact information_ section of Profile first before heading to the _Personal health care contacts_ page. 

> The first thing I think is to go to Profile and then I'd look for stuff here. "Personal health care contacts," I would think. And bada bing, there it is. - P7

> OK, there we go. "Personal health care contacts" saw it right away - P8

---

### 3) Most participants (7 of 9) understood the concept of _Medical emergency contact_. "Medical" in _Medical emergency contact_ caused confusion with 2 participants. All participants understood the term _Emergency contact_.

2 participants thought _Medical emergency contact_ was a contact they could reach out to at the VA if they had an emergency and needed assistance right away, similar to 911. When asked about the meaning of "Emergency contact," these two participants comprehended it as the person to be contacted in case of an emergency.

> It means I would have access - quick access - to the VA to be able to get a hold of someone to be able to talk to them right away. - P1

When asked later in the session about _Emergency contact,_ 

> Yeah, if I were to have a medical procedure, that's a person they could contact to give them information about what's going on on my behalf. - P1

> Emergency contact? In the event of an emergency, it could be your relative, wife, a brother or sister. Doesn't have to be a relative but you have someone designated in case of an emergency. - P3

---

### 4) 4. Most participants (6 of 9) associated _Next of kin_ with family and initially did not differentiate between _Medical emergency contact_ and _Next of kin contact_.

Participants frequently interpreted _Next of kin_ as a family member designated emergency contact. Once on the _Personal health care contacts_ page, participants relied on the hint text to distinguish between the two concepts. 

When first asked participants stated, 

> They are about the same thing, ain't it? - P2

> Means to me anyone like a brother, sister, son, daughter that would be notified about a medical emergency other than a spouse. - P4 

> In general terms, I would think it's the person to contact if something were to happen to me. However, kin means family so I imagine it has to be some kind of blood relative, other than spouse or partner... - P8

Once on the _Personal health care contacts_ page participants stated, 

> It's nice to have what the Next of kin actually meant. - P7 

> Well, if it's the person who can represent your health care wishes, typically you only put one person - P8

---
### 5) 5. Participants wanted a way to edit both _Medical emergency contact_ and _Next of kin contact_ information on the _Personal health care contacts_ page.

All 9 participants wanted functionality to edit and add contacts on the page.

> well, I would expect information or instructions about how to be able to do it myself. It's fine with me like this but it would be nice if I could do it myself on this website. - P1

> You should be able to click on it to make a change and it should give you the option. - P3

> Man that’s horrible! You should be able to do it on the website. - P6

### 6) 6 of 8 participants found the information about how to update their _Personal health care contacts_ and understood the process.

2 participants did not notice the component to learn how to update their information but once prompted by the moderator, understood the content.

### 7) 9 of 9 participants wanted at least two _Medical emergency contacts_ and most participants (7 of 9) wanted multiple _Next of kin_ contacts listed.

Participants wanted multiple contacts listed in case the primary contact was not available. 

When asked how many _Medical emergency contacts_ participants expected to be listed, people said they wanted 2.

> I would’ve thought 2. The primary and a secondary. - P6

One participant stated when referring to next of kin:

> Two, because a lot of times medical decisions need to be made, and if you’re waiting for a return call, an alternate person would be helpful, because I would want to be treated right away. Always good with primary and alternate. Just one is not beneficial at all. - P4

---

### 8) Participants considered "name" and "phone number(s)" as crucial information within both the _Medical emergency contact_ and _Next of kin contact_ sections.

2 participants thought multiple phone numbers (e.g. home, work, mobile) would be important. 1 participant brought up the importance of labeling a home phone so that no one would accidentally try to send a text message to that number.

3 participants mentioned "relationship" as important. Participants specifically talked about the importance of adding these data points so the VA would have more context when reaching out to the person.
   
- 2 participants expected all the information that the VA has on file about emergency contacts and next of kin to be displayed on the Personal health care contacts page

> Whatever information that I gave them that I thought was enough to be able to get a hold of them. - P7

> If you want this person contacted, you're going to have to provide a wealth of information to get in touch with them - P8 


### 9) Participants clearly understood that both the _Medical Emergency contact_ and _Next of kin contact_ were specifically associated with health care.

Of the 6 participants we asked, those participants understood that this information did not pertain to other benefits.  

When asked if this information is related to other benefits, participants commented:

> I wouldn't think so, no. - P1 

> I don't see how it's related to the GI bill… - P3 

> I wouldn't think so, it does say medical emergency contact. - P7

---

## Additional Insights

- Participants recognized the value of the _Personal health care contacts_ page as it indicated whether their information was up to date.

> It would give me peace of mind that if I go to the VA for an emergency, there shouldn't be an issue knowing what my wishes are and how to carry them out. - P8

> It allows me to make sure the information is in place - P9

- Some participants wanted functionally to prioritize multiple Medical emergency contacts and Next of kin contacts.

- Some participants expressed frustration with logging into VA.gov. 

> Last time I tried to get into my VA profile, I ended up on 5 or 6 different websites and each of them sent me back to the login screen so it sent me in circles. I never really got to what I was trying to get. - P5

> The only frustration with me for the website still, there are 3-4 different links that I can use to log in...I think my issues with ID.me is that I have 2 accounts and I get so confused about which one I'm supposed to use...That's the only thing I've really had any issues with [logging in] - P9
