## Intro - 5- minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Jonathan and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes.

I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double check with you before we get going. 

**Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - If yes: Admit observers. 
   - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)
   - Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth


Today we're going to take a look at the VA.gov website and ask you some questions. We’re interested in learning from you what it’s like to navigate and find information on the website.
  
**For screenreader or mobile sessions:** Before we start, I want to confirm a few pieces of information that were shared with me when you signed up for the study:

- **For screenreader sessions:** I understand you use screenreader software to navigate the internet, and that you typically use SOFTWARE NAME.  Are you able to use that during our session today?
- That sounds good, thank you.

- **For mobile sessions:** I understand you use your smartphone primarily to access VA.gov. Can you confirm that you are on your phone now? 

Thank you for confirming these things! Now, I have a few things about today I want to go over with you:

- **This entire session should take about 45-60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If for any reason and at any time you would like to stop the session, or do not want to answer a question, that's no problem. Please let me know. 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
- **I’m also going to make sure transcriptions are turned on to improve our notes.**

_Turn on transcription._

## Warm-up questions - 5-8 minutes
 
Let’s get started.

According to my notes you [do/do not] currently receive health care at a VA health facility. Is that correct?

Thank you. Have you received any other VA benefits?

Great, that’ll be helpful to know as we move forward.

There are a couple of terms I’m curious to talk to you about. I’m interested to know what they mean to you.  

First, what does “medical emergency contact” mean to you?  
- As far as you know, do you have that information in your VA record?
- How do you know?
- How do you expect the VA to use that information?
- Where or when do you expect to be asked about this?

Thank you. What does “Next of kin contact” mean to you?  
- As far as you know, do you have that information in your VA record?
- How do you know?
- How do you expect the VA to use that information?
- Where or when do you expect to be asked about this?

## Tasks

### Task 1: Find EC and NoK information - 10 minutes/15 minutes AT

Thank you for sharing all of that with me! Tell me, how would you check this information in your VA record to be sure it matches what you expect is there?

_if said, they'd ask someone_ If there was no one available to talk to, how would you confirm this information online?

Interesting - let’s start screen sharing so you can show me how you’d do that.

#### Screen sharing instructions

_Instructions for folks NOT using screenreaders:_
- In the Zoom application on your computer/phone/tablet, there is a row of buttons at the bottom. In the center is a (green) button that says Share (phone), Share Screen (computer), or Broadcast screen (iPad). 
  - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.
  - (If you have more than one screen, the row of buttons may be on the screen that's being shared)
  - Now I'd like you to share your screen with me. Tap on the (green) button that says Share. Options should be provided for what to share. Please choose "Screen" (phone) or your web browser.

_Instructions for folks using screenreaders on a desktop:_
- Hit Alt S (as in Same); the option should come up to select the window you want to share - please choose Basic. 
- Tab over and confirm that what is selected is "entire screen." 
- Tab once more - make sure "share sound" is checked. 
- Tab 4 times over to "share screen" - click activate. 

Great, now I can see your screen! Thank you for your patience in figuring this out.  Now please go ahead and show me how you’d check this information?

_Participants may start on Google, VA.gov, or somewhere else.
- _We expect participants will go to VA.gov and be prompted to log in at some point._
- _We eventually need to get them to staging.va.gov_
- I'm going to ask you to open a new tab in your chosen browser and go to staging.va.gov. Let me know if you need any help doing that.
- Now please click the "sign in" button in the top right corner and I'll put the credentials you should use to log in in the chat.
- Great, I’d like for you to show me how to find this information from this page (VA.gov)?
- _Nudge and probe as appropriate. If get totally lost, help them out. Ultimately, has to go to the Profile section of VA.gov._

_Instructions for folks using screenreaders on a desktop:_

### Task 2: Review Personal health contacts page - 8 minutes

2. _Once the person arrives on Profile:_

_If had to be directed to Profile_From here_: If you wanted to review the information VA has on file for who to contact if you're hospitalized, where would you go?
  
_If arrived in the _Personal health care contacts_ section of Profile_

Why don't you spend a little time getting to know this page. Please think out loud and let me know what your thoughts are about the page, the information here, and how everything is organized. 
What do you think this page is all about?
If needed, and applicable: You shared that you also have [XYZ] benefits from VA. Is this information related to those benefits too?
How is this information useful to you? 
Let’s pretend you need to update a phone number for your next of kin, how would you go about doing that? 

### Things to note 
- Is it clear that the “Personal health care contacts” only pertain to health care? 
- Is it clear to users how to update their information? 
- Any struggles or confusion?

### Task 3: Get insights on expectations - 5 minutes 

3. What information for your Emergency contact would you expect/want to have here? Why? 
How many Emergency contacts do you want/expect to list/have? Why? 
What do you expect to be able to do with this information on this page? 

4. What about next of kin, What information for your next of kin would you expect/want to have here? Why? 

How many next of kin would you expect/want to have here? 

What information would be useful to have here? Why? 

## Post-task interview questions - 5 minutes

For participants who don’t currently receive health care: I know you said you don’t currently receive health care at VA. Why do you think you see this information in your profile?

Is there anything else that we haven't talked about that you’d like to share?
Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?


## Thank You and Closing - 1 minute
