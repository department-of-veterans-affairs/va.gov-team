# Personal health contact use cases

**Last updated:** February 15, 2024 (updating link to LOA1 use cases)

For all of these use cases, the user must be LOA3 (identity verified). If the user is not LOA3, the only thing they can access in profile is the Account Security section.

## Common use cases
