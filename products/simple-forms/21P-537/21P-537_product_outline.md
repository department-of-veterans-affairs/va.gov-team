# 21P-537 Form Digitization

---

## Overview
*After you've explored the problem and through testing / hypothesis have identified the ideal solution, write up one sentence describing the solution you'll be creating.*

## Problem Statement
*As part of the Benefits Intake Optimization Project, the VA has a goal to digitize 11 new forms by 11/11/2025. Form 21P-537 - Marital Status Questionnaire - is on the list of those 11 forms. Every year, about 1,900 surviving spouses of deceased Veterans who receive Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) receive a letter with the form in the mail asking them to complete the form and mail it back in the enclosed envelope within 60 days. Each surviving spouse receiving DIC benefits is mailed this letter approximately once every 8 years. The current process is entirely paper based, and dependent on physical mail. Currently, there is no option to submit this form electronically.*

## Desired User Outcomes

*Why would a user want to use this?*
- Digital submission avoids mailing delays and potentially reduces lost forms
- Offers flexibility: Instead of only mailing back the paper form, users could submit online from anywhere, with options to save progress, and receive confirmations
- This could give assistive technology users an option to complete the form without assistance, by leveraging an accessible, online version

*With this problem solved, what should users be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*

By digitizing VA Form 21P-0537, surviving spouses will gain new capabilities:
- Submit the form online quickly and securely
  - Users won't have to rely solely on paper mail
  - They'll receive confirmation that the VA received their submission
- Avoid unnecessary interruptions or overpayments
  - Completing the form digitally lowers the risk of missing deadlines or mailing errors that could cause benefit suspension or overpayment debts
- Access support resources in context
  - A digital workflow can link to additional supporting documentation, FAQs, or support lines, which are harder to surface in a static letter

## Undesired User Outcomes

### Users may be unaware of the digital form submission option
Currently, the letter that DIC beneficiaries receive provides specific instructions to return the form that is provided in the attached envelope within 60 days. Our analysis of online form downloads for the 21P-0537 form suggested that there were 0 downloads of the PDF form which is available on the VA Find-a-Form application from July, 2024 to August, 2025. This might suggest that unless claimants are specifically made aware that there is an electronic submission option, they would not go to the Find-a-form application and discover the electronic form.

### The digital form submission is more time consuming than the paper option
For beneficiaries who have not remarried since the death of the Veteran, the form requires filling out only 6 fields, which could take only 1-2 minutes. Leveraging an online version could be more time consuming than completing the paper form for some users.

## Desired Business Outcomes

*Why would your business want this to exist?*
The digitization of Form 21P-0537 form directly supports the VA's mandate to ensure accurate, timely, and efficient administration of Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC). Specifically, digitization of Form 21P-0537 enables the business to:
- Increase operational efficiencies: Current processes require paper handling, and manual data entry, all of which consume staff time and increase the risk of errors. If adopted by users, an electronic form option could reduce operational overhead for the VA.
- Align with VA’s digital transformation goals: This supports the agency’s broader mandate to optimize benefits intake and provide modern, user-friendly services.

*With this problem solved, what should your business be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*
By solving this problem, VA will gain new capabilities that go beyond the paper-based process:
1. With digital data capture, the VA can more reliably automate processing

2. Scale more easily to meet the 11/11/2025 digitization goal. Lessons learned from digitizing this form can be applied to the other forms, creating repeatable patterns and technical efficiencies.
  
## Undesired Business Outcomes
- If users don't adopt the form, the VA could incur the cost of development and maintenance of the electronic form without a corresponding increase in operational efficiencies from form use.

## Measuring Success


### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

KPIs
1. Digital Submission Adoption Rate
- % of VA Form 21P-0537 submissions completed digitally vs. paper.
- Tracks whether users prefer and successfully adopt the digital option.

2. On-Time Response Rate
- % of users who return the form within 60 days.
- Directly tied to preventing undesired user outcome (loss of DIC benefits).

3. Processing Time (Cycle Time)
- Average time from user submission → marital status update in VBMS.
- Critical for business efficiency and reducing backlog.


#### Baseline KPI Values
* _Baseline values for those most critical metrics. These may come from other systems other than VA.gov e.g. eBenefits._
Ensure surviving spouses can easily, quickly, and confidently verify their marital status online so that Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) benefits are protected without interruption, while reducing the burden of paper processes.

### Objectives and Key results (OKRs)
_What are the measurable targets you're aiming for that delivers value for Veterans?_

- Objective:
  - Key result 1: Increase digital adoption of Form 21P-0537 to at least 25% of submissions by 1/31/2026.
    - Value to Veterans: More survivors can complete the form electronically, avoiding mail delays and uncertainty.
  - Key result 2: Reduce average processing time (submission → VBMS update) by 30%

## Assumptions
- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumption w/your initial set of functionality*

## Solution Approach

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*
- *Does your solution include the VA Health and Benefits mobile application? Explain why or why not.*
