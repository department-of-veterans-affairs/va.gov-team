# 21P-601 Form Digitization

---

## Overview
We will create a digital version of VA Form 21P-601 (Application for Accrued Amounts Due a Deceased Beneficiary) that allows users to apply online for benefits that were owed to a deceased beneficiary. This online form will make it easier to request these benefits without having to mail in a paper form. 

## Problem Statement
*As part of the Benefits Intake Optimization Project, the VA has a goal to digitize 11 new forms by 11/11/2025. Form 21P-601 - Application for Accrued Amounts Due a Deceased Beneficiary - is on the list of those 11 forms.* 

*This is a critical form for survivors of deceased veterans or other VA beneficiaries who may be entitled to benefits that were earned but not paid prior to the beneficiary's death that allows eligible individuals to claim these "accrued" amounts.*

*The current process is entirely paper based, and dependent on physical mail. Currently, there is no option to submit this form electronically.*

## Desired User Outcomes

*Why would a user want to use this?*
- Digital submission avoids mailing delays and potentially reduces lost forms
- Offers flexibility: Instead of only mailing back the paper form, users could submit online from anywhere, with options to save progress, and receive confirmations
- This could give assistive technology users an option to complete the form without assistance, by leveraging an accessible, online version

*With this problem solved, what should users be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*

By digitizing VA Form 21P-601, users will gain new capabilities:
- Submit the form online quickly and securely
  - Users won't have to rely solely on paper mail
  - They'll receive confirmation that the VA received their submission
- Avoid unnecessary interruptions or overpayments
  - Completing the form digitally lowers the risk of missing deadlines or mailing errors that could cause benefit suspension or overpayment debts
- Access support resources in context
  - A digital workflow can link to additional supporting documentation, FAQs, or support lines, which are harder to surface in a static letter

## Undesired User Outcomes

### Users may be unaware of the digital form submission option
[may need more background info for this...]

### The digital form submission is more time consuming than the paper option
[may need more background info for this...]
Leveraging an online version could be more time consuming than completing the paper form for some users.

### Digital divide issues [maybe? if the paper form where eliminated]  

Creating new barriers for grieving families trying to access benefits they're rightfully owed. If the digital form becomes the primary or only option, elderly survivors or those without reliable internet access could be shut out of a process that was already available to them through mail. 
 
## Desired Business Outcomes

*Why would your business want this to exist?*

The digitization of Form 21P-601 form directly supports the VA's mandate to ensure accurate, timely, and efficient administration of Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC). Specifically, digitization of Form 21P-601 enables the business to:
- Increase operational efficiencies: Current processes require paper handling, and manual data entry, all of which consume staff time and increase the risk of errors. If adopted by users, an electronic form option could reduce operational overhead for the VA.
- Align with VA's digital transformation goals: This supports the agency's broader mandate to optimize benefits intake and provide modern, user-friendly services.

*With this problem solved, what should your business be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*

By solving this problem, VA will gain new capabilities that go beyond the paper-based process:

1. With digital data capture, the VA can more reliably automate processing
2. Scale more easily to meet the 11/11/2025 digitization goal. Lessons learned from digitizing this form can be applied to the other forms, creating repeatable patterns and technical efficiencies.

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- If users don't adopt the form, the VA could incur the cost of development and maintenance of the electronic form without a corresponding increase in operational efficiencies from form use.

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. **Digital Submission Adoption Rate**
   - % of VA Form 21P-601 submissions completed digitally vs. paper
   - Tracks whether users prefer and successfully adopt the digital option

2. **On-Time Response Rate**
   - % of users who return the form within 60 days
   - Directly tied to preventing undesired user outcome (loss of DIC benefits)

3. **Processing Time (Cycle Time)**
   - Average time from user submission → marital status update in VBMS
   - Critical for business efficiency and reducing backlog

### Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)

*What are the measurable targets you're aiming for that delivers value for Veterans?*

**Objective:** Improve form submission experience and processing efficiency for beneficiaries

- **Key Result 1:** Increase digital adoption of Form 21P-601 to at least 25% of submissions by 1/31/2026
  - *Value to Veterans:* More survivors can complete the form electronically, avoiding mail delays and uncertainty

- **Key Result 2:** Reduce average processing time (submission → VBMS update) by 30%
  - *Value to Veterans:* Faster processing reduces uncertainty and ensures timely benefit continuation

## Assumptions
- We assume that we will be able to make users aware of the availability of the electronic form option once the electronic form flow is deployed into production. \

## Solution Approach

*What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*


*What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*


*How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*


*Does your solution include the VA Health and Benefits mobile application? Explain why or why not.*

No - this is an electronic form option on VA.gov.

### Supporting Research

We are not aware of any user research.

*If this work is **not supported by existing user research**, will this work include user research?*

We do intend to do usability testing once the form is in production.

*If this work **will include user research**, please briefly state what you hope to learn from that research.*

We hope to uncover ways to make the electronic form more findable, and also easier to complete.

## Launch Strategy

*How are Veterans and others using this product going to know it exists?*

*What marketing, outreach, or communications are necessary for this product to be successful?*

See above.

## Launch Dates
- **Target Launch Date:** 11/3/2025
- **Actual Launch Date:** TBD
- **Impact Evaluation Date:** TBD
  - *What date will you evaluate impact after launch (and when do you expect to have your Impact Review)?*
