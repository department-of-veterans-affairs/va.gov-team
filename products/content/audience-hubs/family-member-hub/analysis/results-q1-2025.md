## Summary

**Goals**

1) As a family member and/or caregiver of a Veteran, I can easily find and learn about the benefits and services available to me.
  - Metrics
    - Are the new pages being utilized as much as or more than the previous pages (findability)
    - Are visitors to the hub engaging with the pages (retention)
    - Are visitors to the hub viewing more than 1 benefit (discoverability)
  - Finding: Partially successful.
    - While the new pages do not have increased traffic, the hub in general shows that visitors are remaining in the hub once there and interacting with the content. GA does not provide elaborate path data to truly understand how often visitors are viewing pages in multiple sub-hubs, but high level data does indicate that some pages are referring visitors to other benefit sub-hubs.

2) As a family member and/or caregiver of a Veteran, I can apply online or understand how to apply for the benefits and services available to me.
  - Metrics
    - Are visitors accessing the applications for family member benefits as much as or more than prior to the new hub (conversion)
    - Are visitors happy with the experience and can they complete their task (satisfaction)
  - Finding: Uncertain.
    - Although number of responses are going up, they are still somewhat low.  Scores for the hub as a whole and individual pages are average, but task completion score is very low.  

3) As a family member and/or caregiver of a Veteran, I can access tools to manage my health care and benefits I am receiving through VA
  - Metrics
    - Are visitors accessing the tools to manage their health care and benefits as much as or more than prior to the new hub (engagement)
  - Finding: Uncertain
    - Engaement with the "Manage benefits" section of each sub-hub is considerably lower than the Veteran hubs for health care and education benefits.  The focus on tasks related to managing benefits was removed from the original scope of the project, so more time is needed to refine this section and understand what would be most effective. 



## Metrics

### Page performance

**Highlights**

- Overall page views are lower and entrance rate is equivalent. Bounce rates can't be compared, but bounces rates below 30% are considered low.
- Exit rates overall are lower, and significantly lower for the Health and Education sub-hub pages. This indicates that visitors are remaining engaged in the site, possibly continuing on in their tasks or discovering related information.
   -  Exit rates for the health and disability landing (~15%) are considerably lower than the previous landing page (>30%) that lived at Health care > Family and caregiver health benefits.
   -  Exit rates for the education landing page(~18%) and considerably lower than the previous landing page (>28%) that lived at Education > Dependent education benefits


Hub |Page views <br> (Month Avg) | Entrance rate | Bounce rate | Exit rate
|---|---|---|---|---
New hub page | 132,854 | 22.57% | 10.03% | 20.36%
Original hub page | 272,870 | 22.29% | .077% | 19.40% 
New hub + 12 child pages |	866,083|	29.21%	|13.51%| 31.09%
Original hub + 11 benefit hub pages 	| 1,178,240	|	29.90%	|	0.74%	|	33.29%	

_Notes:_ 
- _Original data was pulled from Google Universal Analytics and the new data is pulled from GA4, which could account for up to 20% of the difference_
- _Bounce rates are calculated differently in GA4 vs UA and are expected to be higher than UA._



### CSAT 

**Highlights**

- While sample sizes have gone up, they are still relatively low.
- CSAT across individual pages in the new experience ranged from 54.1 (Survivors compensation) to 58.6 (main landing page)
- Percent of respondants that indicated they were able to complete their task was very low across pages - 10-36%

**CSAT scores**

Hub | CSAT <br>score	| CSAT <br>responses	| VA trust <br>score | VA trust <br>responses|	Task completion <br>score	| Task completion <br>responses
---|---|---|---|---|---|---
New hub overall (equivalent pages)|	56.30%	|81|	57.94%|	64	|27.50%|	154
Original hub overall | 	55.53%|	50	|57.25%|	39|	25.33%	|98
  


### Next pages

**Highlights**

- Most of the main landing pages (hub and sub-hub pages) within the family hub had a very high percentage (>70%) of visitors that navigated to another page within the family hub.  This indicates that visitors were remaining in the hubs to complete their tasks or discover more information. 
  - The other sub-hubs that had lower retention rates have 0 (Burials and Life Ins) or 1 (Housing) child pages and mostly require the visitor to link over to a Veteran hub to get more information or complete a related task.
- There are currently 4 benefit applications live within the family member hub - CHAMPVA, PCAFCG, DEA, and Transferred GI Bill benefits. In 3 out of 4, the top next page from the supporting content page is the benefit application. In the 4th case (DEA), the online application is a fraction of a percent behind the DEA rates page as the top next page.
  - The links to download the PDF applications are not consistently tracked.
- GA does not provide elaborate path data to truly understand how often visitors are viewing pages in multiple sub-hubs, but high level data does indicate that some pages are referring visitors to other benefit sub-hubs.
  - 6.3% of next page views from the Education DEA page is the Survivors comp DIC page
  - From the housing sub-hub page, next page views include the Survivors comp sub-hub (8.22%) and the Health and disability sub-hub (5.16%)
  - From the Life insurance sub-hub page, next page views include the Survivors comp DIC (6.58%) and Survivors Pension (5%) pages

**Retention by hub**

Family hub page | % next page also in family hub
--- | ---
Family and caregiver hub landing page | 70.4%
Health and disability benefits | 74.53%
Survivor compensation | 80.79%
Education and careers | 74.65%
Housing assistance | 55.92%
Life insurance | 35.85%
Burials and memorials | 17.51%



### Page clicks

**Highlights**

- The links provided on the main family and caregiver benefits hub page had a combined total clicks that was over 7x more than the clicks within the corresponding Veteran benefits hubs.
  - The "Health and disability benefits" link in the family hub had 135,520 clicks, while the "Family health care benefits" link in the Veteran health care hub had only 15,499 clicks
  - The "Survivors compensation" link had 72,868 clicks, while the combined total for the "Survivor and Dependent compensation" link in disability (14,444) and the "Survivors Pension" link in Pension (9,789) had a total of only 24,333 clicks.
- Engagement with the sub-hub pages was primarily driven by the options within the "Get benefits" section of the page, which is somewhat different than the Veteran hubs where they are often split evenly between the "Get" and "Manage".
- The family sub-hubs did show a higher engagement - sometimes significantly higher - with the "Related benefits and services" section than most of the Veteran hubs have. This is a positive thing given one of the goals of creating this hub was to improve discoverability of other benefits a family member may be eligible for.
  - For example, the family life insurance sub-hub related benefits section received 22.25% of the total page clicks, while on the Veteran hub, the related benefits section only had 2.43% of the total page clicks.
  - On the Family and caregiver benefits hub page, the section at the bottom titled "Help a Veteran find benefits" performed ok (10.53% of page clicks) for a "related options" type section.  The highest clicked option was disability compensation (3.26% clicks) followed by life insurance (2.34%) clicks.  The higher clicks on disability compensation could be related to dependent management given the high searches for that term.

### Search queries by page

**Highlights**

- When visitors on a page within the family and caregiver hub ultimately execute a search and leave the hub, it is an indication that they may not be finding what they are looking for.
- Overall, only 3.4% of page views within the entire hub led to a search query.  The two pages with the highest number of search queries were the main hub page and the CHAMPVA page.
- Searches are frequently related to chapter 35 (DEA), CHAMPVA, and dependents information.
- In some cases, visitors are searching for alternative names to a benefit while on that benefit page.  For example, "chapter 35" is frequently searched for from the DEA page.

## Recommendations

1) Add dependents management crosslinks - The current family and caregiver benefit hub landing page does not include a link or reference to managing dependents. This was originally not included given it is information that impacts the Veteran's benefits not the family members, and only a Veteran can modify.  Given the high search volume across various pages, adding a crosslink to this feature may help with findability.
2) Ensure references to key terms, alternative names, and form numbers where appropriate - Search data shows that visitors are searching for specific form numbers or alternative names while on the specific page related to those terms.  We should review how we label benefits and their associated forms to ensure we are hitting on key terms. For example, DEA education benefits are often searched for as "chapter 35" and "22-5490".
3) Implement tracking on "Additional benefits" section of sub-hub pages - the links in these sections of the sub-hub pages do not appear to be tracked in GA4.
4) Review Medallia feedback for task related comments to determine what challenges there are to completing tasks within the hub.
5) Review the "manage benefits" sections within each sub-hub to determine what links are performing well, what might be missing, and what family members can actually do online to manage their benefits.
