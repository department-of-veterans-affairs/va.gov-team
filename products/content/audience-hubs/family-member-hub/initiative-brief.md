# Initiative Brief: Family member benefit hub expansion
#### Overview

The VA.gov family member benefit hub has served as a front door to core benefit information for family members since the 2018 VA.gov redesign. But the deeper benefit information lives scattered amongst the benefit hubs. Research shows that family members are going to the hub for their information and communication efforts across VA are aiming to bring family member information (and specifically survivor information) together to help make it easier for family members to understand and access their benefits.

**Goals:**
- This effort is to create a single location for family member benefits that will make it easier for family members to find, understand, and use their benefits. By pulling family member benefits out of the Veteran benefit hubs, this effort will also help to streamline the Veteran benefit experience and reduce the cognitive burden of links and content in those hubs.


**Product(s) impacted**
- Family member hub
- Benefit hubs
- Resources and support

## Problems to solve

**Problem Defined:**
Family and caregiver benefit content, applications, and tasks are distributed across the Veteran benefit hubs.  Furthermore, tools related to managing health care and benefits are mostly framed up for the Veteran, but often also intended for family members and caregivers to use.
  
**Evidence to support Problem:**
- Research and data is showing a trend towards more use of the family member hub; Over the past year, the family member hub has had more page views than any of the other family member benefit pages within the benefit hubs
- The streamlined health care hub helped visitors find the correct family and caregiver benefit information, as opposed to selecting veteran content to find their answers; In addition, the streamlined hub showed an increase of family members looking for information to complete "manage" taskss such as travel pay
- The family member benefit hub is the #1 referring page on VA.gov to all of the other family/caregiver benefit pages within the benefit hubs; However, while the family hub consistently refers visitors to family content in the veteran hubs, the family content in veteran hubs is not referring visitors to the family hub; This is a potential opportunity to better expose family members to the other benefit options they have
- vEO Military Spouse research showed that spouses want to be recognized as their own individual, and have easier access to information 


* Why do you think the problem is occurring? Other reasons why this might be occurring?
 - Content is currently organized by Veteran benefit and is not necessarily optimized for different audiences
  
* How does this initiative help further OCTO-DE's mission and goals?
  - Streamline the IA
 

## Desired User Outcomes
- As a family member and/or caregiver of a Veteran, I can easily
  - find and learn about the benefits and services available to me
  - apply online or understand how to apply for the benefits and services available to me
  - access tools to manage my health care and benefits I am receiving through VA

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Family members or caregivers of Veterans
  - are unable to find information and applications for the benefits and services avilable to them
  - are unable to find the tools that allow them to manage their health care and benefits they receive through VA
  - 

## Desired Business Outcomes
- Increased enrollment and use of family member benefits and services
- Reduced calls from family members and caregivers unable to find benefit content and tasks


## Undesired Business Outcomes
- Increased calls from family members and caregivers unable to find benefit content and tasks

**Additional data points to watch**
- No detriment to SEO of Veteran content due to similar family member content (i.e. same benefit has content in Veteran hub and family hub)

## Discovery

### Assumptions/Risks

**Assumptions**


**Risks**
- Family members will continue to look for benefits information in the Veteran hubs more the family member hub (this is the current state)
- Family members will get lost once sent into the Veteran hubs for certain tasks and applications
- Organization of the family member hub may make it difficult to find benefits that pertain to the visitor (i.e. benefits specific to parents or survivors)
- Loss of SEO with changes in placement, titles, and URLs
- Potential 404s
- Resources and support only allows selecting one audience type - Veteran or family member - and some content will be for both audiences
- Loss of trust from family members and caregivers if the findability of benefit information becomes more difficult
- Stakeholders disagree or block the changes needed
- Development work needed from teams outside Sitewide to support moving applications and tools


### Solution Scope

**In Scope**
- Moving explore and apply content pages ("get" spoke content) from Veteran benefit hubs to the family member hub and implementing URL changes and redirects
- Moving pages and segments of pages from benefit hubs into Resources and support and implementing redirects as needed
- Improving crosslinking from Veteran benefit hubs and resources and support to the family member and caregiver hub
- UX and technical updates to Resources and support to support the additional content for a new audience

**Not In Scope**
- We do not intend to move content, forms, or tools that are part of the "Manage" spoke of the hubs.  Those features will remain where they are for at least the initial iteration, and the family member hub will crosslink to them.

  
## Approach

1. Review and synthesis of existing research and data
2. Design new IA
3. Research with family members and caregivers
4. Create content
5. Implement structure

- Overview: This project is aimed at streamlining Veteran benefit hub content by implementing the content placement criteria.  This will lead to moving a lot of content from the hubs into Resources and support. 

Resources and support
- Primary contact(s): Dave Conlon
- Overview:  This product may need some technical and UX changes to acommodate the increase of content, specifically around a new audience type. There currently is not team actively working on this product.

Service member hub
- Primary contact(s): Danielle Therry, Mikki Northuis
- Overview:  There is work planned to look at enhancing the exsiting service member benefit hub.  The family hub work may help to inform the service member hub work.
