## Page metrics

- Overall page views are lower and entrance rate is equivalent. Bounce rates can't be compared, but bounces rates below 30% are considered low.
- Exit rates overall are lower, and significantly lower for the Health and Education sub-hub pages. This indicates that visitors are remaining engaged in the site, possibly continuing on in their tasks or discovering related information.
   -  Exit rates for the health and disability landing (~15%) are considerably lower than the previous landing page (>30%) that lived at Health care > Family and caregiver health benefits.
   -  Exit rates for the education landing page(~18%) and considerably lower than the previous landing page (>28%) that lived at Education > Dependent education benefits
 
Hub |Page views | Entrance rate | Bounce rate | Exit rate
|---|---|---|---|---
New hub page | 132,854 | 22.57% | 10.03% | 20.36%
Original hub page | 272,870 | 22.29% | .077% | 19.40%

Original hub + 11 benefit hub pages 	| 1,178,240	|	29.90%	|	0.74%	|	33.29%	

_Notes:_ 
- _Original data was pulled from Google Universal Analytics and the new data is pulled from GA4, which could account for up to 20% of the difference_
- _Bounce rates are calculated differently in GA4 vs UA and are expected to be higher than UA._



## CSAT 

- While sample sizes have gone up, they are still relatively low.
- CSAT across individual pages in the new experience ranged from 54.1 (Survivors compensation) to 58.6 (main landing page)

## Next pages

**Highlights**

- Most of the main landing pages (hub and sub-hub pages) within the family hub had a very high percentage (>70%) of visitors that remained in the family hub after leaving that page.  This indicates that visitors were remaining in the hubs to  complete their tasks or discover more information. 
  - The other sub-hubs that had lower retention rates have 0-1 child pages and mostly require the visitor to link over to a Veteran hub to get more information or complete a related task.

The higher clicks on disability compensation could be related to dependent management given the high searches for that term.

**Page clicks for each of the sub-hub pages**

Sub-hub | Total page clicks | % in Get benefits | % in Management benefits | % in More resources | % in Related benefits and services
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Health and disability | 173,515 | 86.87% | 4.47% | 5.5% | 7.7%
Survivors compensation | 96,199 | 69.36% | 9.13% | 16.58% | 4.94%

Burial and memorial | 20,236 | 68.06% | 14.08% | 10.78% | 7.08%

- Engagement with the sub-hub pages was primarily driven by the options within the "Get benefits" section of the page, which is somewhat different than the Veteran hubs where they are often split evenly between the "Get" and "Manage".
- The family sub-hubs did show a higher engagement - sometimes significantly higher - with the "Related benefits and services" section than most of the Veteran hubs have. This is a positive thing given one of the goals of creating this hub was to improve discoverability of other benefits a family member may be eligible for.
  - For example, the family life insurance sub-hub related benefits section received 22.25% of the total page clicks, while on the Veteran hub, the related benefits section only had 2.43% of the total page clicks.

## Recommendations

- The current family and caregiver benefit hub landing page does not include a link or reference to managing dependents. This was originally not included given it is information that impacts the Veteran's benefits not the family members.  Adding a link to this feature within the hub should be considered.
