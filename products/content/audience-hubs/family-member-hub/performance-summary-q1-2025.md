## Hub engagement

### Sub-hub exploration
- The goal of the hub and sub-hub landing pages is group benefits in a way that helps visitors find specific benefits. Besides measuring how many exit the site entirely (exit rate), another metric to gauge retention specifically in the family and caregiver hub, is to look at what page visitors go to after viewing a sub-hub page - do they click into a specific benefit and remain in the family hub or do they click out of it.
- The main hub landing page had good retention, more than 37% of visitors clicked into a sub-hub to find more information.
- The "Survivors compensation" sub-hub had the highest retention with at least 58% of visitors to that page clicking into a child page.
- The "Health and disability" and "Education and careers" sub-hub landing pages retained at least 46% and 44% of visitors respectively.
- The other sub-hubs only have 0-1 child page making this metric less relevant.


### Search queries by page
- When visitors on a page within the family and caregiver hub ultimately execute a search and leave the hub, it is an indication that they may not be finding what they are looking for.

  - 7.94% of the page views for the family and caregiver hub page resulted in a search - 10,545 total queries which is 22.52% of the total queries within the family hub

### Page engagement**


## Recommendations

- The current family and caregiver benefit hub landing page does not include a link or reference to managing dependents. This was originally not included given it is information that impacts the Veteran's benefits not the family members.  Adding a link to this feature within the hub should be considered.
