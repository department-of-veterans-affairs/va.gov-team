## Hub engagement

### Sub-hub exploration
- The goal of the hub and sub-hub landing pages is group benefits in a way that helps visitors find specific benefits. Besides measuring how many exit the site entirely (exit rate), another metric to gauge retention specifically in the family and caregiver hub, is to look at what page visitors go to after viewing a sub-hub page - do they click into a specific benefit and remain in the family hub or do they click out of it.
- The main hub landing page had good retention, more than 37% of visitors clicked into a sub-hub to find more information.
- The "Survivors compensation" sub-hub had the highest retention with at least 58% of visitors to that page clicking into a child page.
- The "Health and disability" and "Education and careers" sub-hub landing pages retained at least 46% and 44% of visitors respectively.
- The other sub-hubs only have 0-1 child page making this metric less relevant.


### Search queries by page

- Overall, only 3.4% of page views led to a search query
  - 7.94% of the page views for the family and caregiver hub page resulted in a search - 10,545 total queries which is 22.52% of the total queries within the family hub

- The links provided on the main family and caregiver benefits hub page had a combined total clicks that was over 7x the corresponding clicks within the Veteran benefits hubs total
  - The "Health and disability benefits" link in the family hub had 135,520 clicks, while the "Family health care benefits" link in the Veteran health care hub had on 15,499 clicks
  - The "Survivors compensation" link had 72,868 clicks, while the combined total for the "Survivor and Dependent compensation" link in disability (14,444) and the "Survivors Pension" link in Pension (9,789) had a total of 24,333
- On the Family and caregiver benefits hub page, the bottom section for "Help a Veteran find benefits" performed ok (10.53% of page clicks) for a "related options" type section .  The highest clicked option was disability compensation (3.26% clicks) followed by life insurance (2.34%) clicks.  The higher clicks on disability compensation could be related to dependent management given the high searches for that term.

**Page clicks for each of the sub-hub pages**

Sub-hub | Total page clicks | % in Get benefits | % in Management benefits | % in More resources | % in Related benefits and services
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Health and disability | 173,515 | 86.87% | 4.47% | 5.5% | 7.7%
Survivors compensation | 96,199 | 69.36% | 9.13% | 16.58% | 4.94%
Education and careers | 205,962 | 70.71% | 11.41% | 14.97% | 2.91%
Housing assistance | 6,064 | 42.35% | 18.02% | 9.07% | 28.36%
Life insurance | 12,873 | 55.21% | 7.54% | 15.00% | 22.25%
Burial and memorial | 20,236 | 68.06% | 14.08% | 10.78% | 7.08%

- Engagement with the sub-hub pages was primarily driven by the options within the "Get benefits" section of the page, which is somewhat different than the Veteran hubs where they are often split evenly between the "Get" and "Manage".
- The family sub-hubs did show a higher engagement - sometimes significantly higher - with the "Related benefits and services" section than most of the Veteran hubs have. This is a positive thing given one of the goals of creating this hub was to improve discoverability of other benefits a family member may be eligible for.
  - For example, the family life insurance sub-hub related benefits section received 22.25% of the total page clicks, while on the Veteran hub, the related benefits section only had 2.43% of the total page clicks.  

## Recommendations

- The current family and caregiver benefit hub landing page does not include a link or reference to managing dependents. This was originally not included given it is information that impacts the Veteran's benefits not the family members.  Adding a link to this feature within the hub should be considered.
