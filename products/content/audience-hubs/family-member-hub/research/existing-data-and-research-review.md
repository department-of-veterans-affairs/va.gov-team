# Review of existing data and research

## Background and purpose

As we look at the idea of a more robust family member and caregiver benefit hub and plan for research, we wanted to review current analytics, past research, and any other qualitative data we have around the existing family member and caregiver experience. 

This file contains information on the following
1. [Data pulled from analytics and search data](#analytics)
2. [Related findings from past research efforts](#research)
3. [Summary of Medallia and call center data](#callcenter)



## Findings

1. **Research and data shows an increase in need of a centralized benefit area for family members and caregivers**
    - Recent tree tests for the MHV portal showed more family member participants looking initially to the family member benefit hub for information on their own benefits rather than the top level Veteran benefit hubs.
    - Analytics show a steady increase in traffic to the family member hub - almost 4x as many visitors per month in 2023 compared to 2019.  Overall monthly pageviews is just under 2x what it was in 2019.
    - The family member hub is clicked over 4x more than any other family option in the top nav.
    - Over the past year, the family member hub has had approximately 2.5x more page views than any of the other family benefit landing pages within the benefit hubs.
    - In recent VEO military spouse research, it was found that spouses feel like a 3rd wheel to the military, and they want to be seen as their own person.

      
2. **The current experience for family members and caregivers is minimal, scattered, and disjointed**
    - The family member and caregiver content is light and often intermingled with Veteran pages. In some cases, the family member information is placed on the same page as core Veteran page rather than on it's own page - making it challenging to find and understand what applies to them. 
    - Visitors are looking to the family member hub to find information, but the current experience then sends the visitor into the Veteran benefit hubs and content for each benefit.
    - Although the family member hub is the top referring page into the family content in the Veteran benefit hubs, the Veteran hubs pages are not referring traffic back to the family member hub as often, creating a missed opportunity to provide information on other benefits available to the visitor.
    - In tree tests for the health portal, family member participants often mistakenly selected their answer from Veteran benefit pages rather than a page specific to family members. As we streamlined the Veteran benefit hub and built out the family hub in those tests, we saw this behavior start to flip.
      
3. **Family members and caregivers also struggle to find information on managing their benefits**
    - Forms, tools, and information needed to complete tasks related to managing their benefits have also shown to be challenging to find. 
    - In the health portal research, when the Veteran benefit hub was streamlined, it showed an increase of family members looking for travel pay within the family member hub. 
    - While 38% of the comments received from the feedback survey specifically indicate that they were attempting to learn and apply for a benefit, 15% of the comments did pertain to tasks related to managing family or caregiver benefits. 
      
4. **The family member hub should speak to the various audiences within this group** 
    - Top searches contain more specific terms than "family" - i.e. dependent, caregiver, survivor, spouse.
    - In the health portal research, a slight change in labels from "family member benefits" to "family and caregivers" increased traffic and selections in this area.
    - In comments from the feedback and intercept surveys, specific terms are often used when commenting or asking questions - i.e. husband, wife, partner, child, survivor, etc. 





## <a name="analytics"></a>Site analytics and search data 

### Summary

- Over the past year, the family member hub has had more page views than any of the other family member benefit pages within the benefit hubs  
- It is also the #1 referring page on VA.gov to all of the other benefit pages within the benefit hubs.  However, visitors do not go to the family member hub after viewing family content within benefit hub page as often.  So while the family hub consistently refers visitors to family content in the veteran hubs, the family content in veteran hubs is not referring visitors to the family  hub.  This is a potential opportunity to better expose family members to the other benefit options they have. 
- The family member hub is clicked at least 4x more than any other family content option in the top nav, but quite a bit less than the core benefit options
- Top searches contain more specific terms than "family" - i.e. dependent, caregiver, survivor, spouse

## <a name="research"></a>Past Veteran and family member research

### Summary
- The streamlined health care hub helped visitors find the correct family and caregiver benefit information, as opposed to selecting veteran content to find their answers
- Recent tree tests for the MHV portal showed more family member participants looking initially to the family member benefit hub for information on their own benefits
- In addition, the streamlined hub showed an increase of family members looking for travel pay within the family member hub.  In these tests, that hub was not built out so they did not find the answers there and had to look elsewhere, but this indicates their initial mindset to favor the family member hub
- Both rounds of the MHV portal tree testing showed

[12/2022 My Health IA test Round 2 - Caregivers](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/overall-content-IA/2022-12-health-apt-tree-test-round2/mhv-on-va-round-2-tree-test-findings.md)

- In this version of the IA (H2) - the health care hub was further streamlined, and the family hub was renamed to "Family and caregivers"
- In this round, the revised IA continued to perform better than the existing structure for family members finding eligibility content for their own health care benefits - 67% success in baseline vs 73% for both H1 and H2 structures. 
- In addition, this version saw improvements in family members finding content relevant to themselves
  - A reduction in the number of participants that selected Veteran content (27% down to 19%)
  - An increase in the number of participants selecting family member content in the health care hub (13% to 19%)
  - An increase in the number of participants selecting content in the family member hub (53% to 57%)
- In all 3 versions of the IA, more family member participants initially looked in the family member benefits section than in the health care hub for eligibility info for their own benefits. In addition, this version showed a significant increase in family members looking in the family hub for travel pay (10% up to 38%) - unfortunately, the option was not there and this resulted in a reduction in task success (43% down to 35%)
- Recommendation from that research: Consider building out and testing a more robust experience within the family and caregiver benefit hub that includes both information on benefits as well as tasks that family members may need to complete related to their own benefits or benefits they receive for caring for their veteran (i.e. travel pay, apply for transferred benefits, add a dependent, etc) 

[08/2022 My Health IA test Round 1 - Caregivers ](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/overall-content-IA/2022-07-health-apt-tree-test-round1)
- When asked to find information on health care benefits for themselves, 
  - In the existing structure 51% explored the health care hub and 31% explored the family member hub
  - 13% selected "Family health benefits" under the health care hub, while 29% selected an answer in the family member hub. In addition, 24% selected veteran content as their answer
  - In the H1 version (somewhat streamlined health care hub), 39% selected an answer in the family member hub, while only 8% selected "Family and caregiver benefits" in the health care hub.  In addition, 25% selected veteran content as their answer.
- Mental health care information was generally difficult to find for all participants - family members/caregivers looked to the main health care hub 67% of the time, and the family member hub only 13% of the time.  
- Participants visited the family member hub 31% of the time for tasks related to getting benefits for themselves. This percentage increased to 40% in the H1 version. 

[7/2022 Veteran Top Tasks](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/unmoderated/research-findings.md)
- No findings specific to family members
- These results included both a moderated version of the survey and an unmoderated version

[11/2021 Non-veteran user roles research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/65)
- Includes basic definitions of non-veteran roles that visit VA.gov
- Some interesting notes from interview with Meg Kabalt
  - Survivors "They become beneficiaries themselves whereas families and caregivers are beneficiaries through the veteran."
  - Beneficiary: someone who directly receives a service (payment, health care, whatever it may be) from VA
  - Where do advocates fit in? POAs, CSOs, claim agents, etc.  Some of these are family, many are not.

[VEO Military Spouse research]()

**Insights**
- Reconstructing identities - spouses feel like a 3rd wheel to the military which forces them to restructure their own identities and goals; they want to be seen as their own person; each time the system asks for Veteran info (ID) it reinforces that they are not a unique individual and are second 
- Recurring churn - change is the only constant in military lifestyle; builds resilience but its hard; gets easier with each repetition but takes its toll; spouses take on stability in the home - managing the house/logistics coordination, also take on mental and emotional well being of the family
- Adapting practically - how spouses are contending with this reality; seeking education, entreprenuer, volunteering for personal and financial stability; always weighing trade offs - is it worth it to engage with the resource, sets stage for transition
- Transition tension - spouses are used to adapting but transition has unique barriers; are the veterans communicating their expectations and goals at transition; spouses not invited into the transition/tap program to learn; it's online but they don't know that; spouse should have same info and encourage conversation
- Community is a resource cornerstone - empathy, comraderie, but also resource connection; not being part of the communities is a barrier whether it's because of how they feel labeled or logistical; sometimes they just throw their issue out to the wind - facebook groups; spouses feel dropped
- Perusing resources aplenty - there are hurdles to getting to the resources; too much to sort through and know what applies to you; spouses knew their disability rating but not what it meant to them; they didn't know the caregiver program services; often info is second-hand making it incomplete or incorrect and confusing; misperceptions that spouse is not eligible for resources so they are underutilized and that benefits go away after service

**Areas of opportunity**
- (didn't capture quant data on site behaviors - i.e. how often are they seeking info for their veteran, or acting as caregive without the title)
- Identity and employment - explore how to reinforce their importance, map services with spouses
- Outreach and onboarding - proactive outreach, eligibility and enrollment info, tailored content to reach spouses with timely info
- Skill building
