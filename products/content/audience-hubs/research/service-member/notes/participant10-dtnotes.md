## First Task: Benefits Questions - 10 minutes

- **Have you ever used any VA benefits or services?** <br>
Yes.

  - **Tell me about the last time you interacted with VA.** <br>
  Hmm, umm, my most recent interaction would have been actually pretty recently, about a month ago. So I do receive VA disability, and I am a Navy reservist so I still drill, and I just went back on active duty for a year. So I had to stop my disability benefits, and I had a phone interaction as far as getting that taken care of.
  
    - **How did that go? Was it positive?** <br>
    It was, yeah. Yeah, it was a good experience. The fact that I probably did it about a month ago. Maybe it wasn’t quite a month. Actually, it was in July, and as far as I know, my benefit was stopped so it was actually pretty timely. <br>
  
    - **What was the most difficult part of the experience?** <br>
    I had to…let’s see, yeah, probably that I had to, obviously, send orders to justify that I was on orders to stop the benefits. So they needed that document. I had to fax it to them, and there’s no confirmation of them receiving the fax. So the business process is lacking, shall we say, in terms of communication.
  
    - **What were you hoping for?** <br>
    I would like to have somewhere I can go and get confirmation…on the benefits website, you can see that dialogue. But there’s no dialogue for this that yes, I’ve received it….I basically had to wait until the day to see if a check showed up. The bad news is that if I did receive a check, I’m going to incur debt and I’m going to have to pay that money back...It’s something that—it’s just annoying. I did get paid, but I’m still kind of in the dark….faxed it, got no confirmation. There’s no website to go to to get a confirmation. At least not that I know of, the person I talked to didn’t give me one.
      
- **Are there any times in your life where you are planning to interact with VA in the future?** <br>
I will have to send them completion orders when I’m done with this set of orders, which will be in September, to start my benefits again. That will be the same process, I believe—send it to some fax number that I’ve never heard of and wait until my benefits begin. So it’s a little clunky.

- **When are you planning to retire?** <br>
I will stay at least 8 more years, if not longer. I was just promoted, so I’ll be sticking around. I’ll be staying around to 30 years of service. There’s a very slim chance I’ll get promoted again, then I’d be staying a while longer. But probably 8 years or so.

-	**If you were getting near retirement or looking to get a VA benefit, how would you get info about VA?** <br>
I would use the VA website. I do use the benefits site, log in and check in there. Other than that, I would use Google.

    -	**And which website do you use?** <br>
    Forgive me, I'm going to have to say...is it my benefits?
    
    - **eBenefits?** <br>
    eBenefits. Yes, that's what I use.
    
    - **Have you ever used any others? My HealtheVet or VA.gov?** <br>
    I have used VA.gov. If I’m just kind of researching general info, that’s usually where I’ll start. But often I can just find it…I have used My HealtheVet mainly for disability documentation, I think it was. I haven’t used it in some time.
    
    - **What was the last task you used eBenefits for?** <br>
    To look at my disability payment.
    
    - **How did that experience go?** <br>
     Good. I've used it before so I'm familiar with it. So I kind of know where to go.
     
    - **Do you have an account on eBenefits?** <br>
     I do.
    
    - **Do you know which type of account?** <br>
    I use my CAC card, so I guess it’s a member…I can look at my benefits, I can look at payments I receive. I had education,  I exhausted it here this last term. It gives a good description of the payments you received from the VA. I can go back and look and see that this was a disability payment, that was a GI Bill payment, that was a GI Bill payment for books, etc.

    - **Do you have a DS Logon or My HealtheVet or ID.me account?** <br>
    I mean, it’s the CAC through the DMDC. I don’t use a password and login anymore. I probably have one, but I don’t remember what it is now. Now, when I retire and I get the other ID card and it’s not a CAC anymore, I don’t know…I guess I’ll figure it out when I get there.

    -	**If you were to visit VA.gov in the future, what would you expect to see there?** <br>
    Again, just general information. I use Google probably if I’m looking for more specifics such as when I was looking for what I needed to do to stop my benefits. Instead of digging through the layers, it would bring it up faster.
    
      -	**Can you elaborate on what you mean by general information?** <br>
      I probably don’t use it as much now. But I used it when I was researching my benefits, what the GI Bill was at the time and what I could expect to receive. Going through the disability process. Looking for forms. Things like that. I don’t really need to use it now because I’m not pursuing any new benefits at this point.
      


## Second Task: Card Sort - 20 minutes

I’m just gonna try to think of this on the fly. ***[moves Pension to its own category]*** Going to start with pension, put it there, not really sure what to think about it yet. <br>

***[moves Voc Rehab to its own category]*** We’ll go with vocational rehabilitation. <br>

***[moves Health Care and Disability together]*** Okay, one trend or group that I do see is Disability with Health Care. What I’m thinking there is that VA is disability and health care, and they can be tied together. I guess for me they are. I did use the health care system for a bit, but I stopped because I do have private coverage. But some of that was tied into my disability process, going through those evaluations and stuff. <br>

***[moves TAP and Voc Rehab together]*** TAP, I’m looking at that and seeing a transition benefit. Coming off of active duty, and they may need vocational rehabilitation and TAP. <br>

Let’s see. I see the pension benefit as being something that’s kind of towards what I would consider retirement. From my perspective, I mean, active duty, they leave the service, if they retire per se but their career is not retired, they’re not necessarily…well, for me, I don’t collect my pension until 59.5 so that’s what I would consider retired overall. That’s what I would consider as things that...<br>

[***moves Burials over with Pension]*** Burials... <br>

***[moves Life Insurance over with Pension]*** Life insurance options, even though I would probably get the life insurance before, but it’s in that grouping. <br>

***[moves GI Bill and Education and Career and Employment Assistance into group with TAP and Voc Rehab]*** Education and careers, I’ll put here. <br>

***[moves Records over with Health Care and Disability]*** Records, I typically affiliate with the medical piece so we’re going to put that with the disability and health care. <br>

***[moves Home Loan over with Pension, Burials, and Life Insurance]*** And then we’ve got the VA home loan, which I’ve also had experience with recently. We’ll put that here, even though it’s not end of life. Sorry, that’s horrible, I shouldn’t say that. End of career. That’s kind of a beast unto its own. <br>

That’s kind of how I would sort them: transition into civilian life, the medical piece of disability and health care, and then things outside of those items.  Home loan doesn’t fit there really, but I’m going to put it there. <br>

***[moderator asks: End of career as in military career or post military career?]**** <br>

We’ll call it post military and civilian career. So basically, beyond 59.5, 65, that sort of age, when somebody’s ready to retire if they’d like to retire. <br>

***[moderator asks participant to label each group]*** <br>

***[referring to the group with TAP, Voc Rehab, GI Bill, Careers]*** I’ll call this "Mil-Civ Transition." <br>

***[moderator asks if participants and his fellow Veterans understand what “mil” and “civ mean and if they’d expect them to be abbreviated or written out]*** <br>

Yes, “mil” being military and “civ” being civilian transition. My assumption would be that most military members know what “mil to civ” means, but you’re correct that someone outside of Veteran status I would assume would not know what that means. <br>

***[referring to the group with Health Care, Disability, and Records]*** Our next category is going to be, we’ll  just say "Health & Disability" because that’s kind of what they are. <br>

***[referring specifically to the Health Care card]*** And I know it says “retirement and separation, “ but again, they could be different because they are different plans. So maybe this should be separated into 2 different buckets. ***[moderator asks for confirmation that participant is indicating that health care should be separated into retirement and separation]***  I think there’s the argument for it, sure. Again, everything’s based on your health and disability, so it’s probably fine. <br>

***[referring to the group with Pension, Burial, Life Insurance, and Home Loan]*** If I’m looking at this last box, I’m going to call it “Post-Career.” I’ll put down there also “59+” because that’s the Reserve pension program. And I mean, you could definitely put a retirement health care into that too because I believe it changes. That’s when you become eligible for Medicare and other pieces of that. I think there’s the argument to separate that piece, but… <br>

***[moves Home Loan to its own category]*** The only one I would pull out would be this one because that’s really available any time.

***[finalizes groups and labels them as below]***

- **Mil-Civ Transition**
  - Transition Assistance Program (TAP)
  - Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Benefits
  - GI Bill and Other Education Benefits
  - Career and Employment Assistance
- **Health & Disability**
  - Pre-Discharge Disability Claim
  - Health Care After Separation or Retirement
  - Records
- **Post-Career/59+**
  - Veterans Pension Benefits
  - Burial in a VA National Cemetery
  - Life Insurance Options and Eligibility
- **VA Home Loans**
  - Certificate of Eligibility for a VA-backed Home Loan

***[moderator recaptures groupings and asks when participant thinks you would use health care and disability benefits]***

Again, most of those are probably associated with that transition. I mean, TAP technically could be. But yeah, I mean, they would kind of be a subcategory maybe. That’s what I think of, that that’s something that happens when you become a Veteran.
Home loan can happen any time and post-career are things that happen when you enter retirement.

### Follow-up Questions:

- **Which of these cards are the most important to you?** <br>
Hmm…*[pause]*…well, I’d have to pick the VA home loan because I recently bought a home, and it’s a VA loan. And of course I’m going to be biased because it’s the one I’ve used. </br> </br> GI Bill, like I said, I’ve exhausted the benefits of that. I used it for a graduate degree. </br> </br>I have to throw disability in there because I’ve gone through that process, and I do receive a benefit for that. If we were ranking that would be number 3. </br> </br> And I’d pick 2 more. Number 4 would be health care. I don’ t currently utilize it, but it’s available to me. </br> </br> I know the other ones are there and I could use them, but it’s not something I think about.

- **Any others you might use in the future?** <br>
I could use burial. My wife and I have actually talked about mortuary stuff. We haven’t made any decisions, but we have talked about being buried in a military cemetery, so I could see me using that. </br></br>
Life insurance, possibly. Again, I have private life insurance now, but that could be a benefit down the road, especially as my life insurance expires because it’s term. If I need to continue some, it’s probably the most cost-effective as far as life insurance goes at some point. </br></br> I’ve used TAP, but I’m beyond that at this point. </br></br> Careers I’ve never used. Fortunately, I have never had to use them. But again, it’s there. </br></br> Records, I see that as just part of the internal workings of the VA process. </br></br>
I hope that kind of answer your questions.

- **Any that you were not aware of before today?** <br>
Probably not. I’ve probably seen all of these. I guess records, I wouldn’t consider that a benefit. I see that as part of the process. But I mean, there are records, so that’s true. That’s the only kind of outlier.

- **Any benefits that you think are missing here?** <br>
I know of—and it’s only because the graduate degree I’m working on is a PhD, and I did a little bit of work on the VA small business loan. People don’t know about it, but it’s a pretty cool benefit. The requirements for it make it very appealing, especially for a Veteran. So that’s probably one that the VA has that’s not listed here. </br></br> 
Are you asking me for stuff that the VA might not have?

  -	**Just anything you’d expect to find here.** <br>
  Nope, that’s probably the only one.
