## First Task: Benefits Questions - 10 minutes

- **Have you ever used any VA benefits or services?** <br>

Yes

  - **Tell me about the last time you interacted with VA.** <br>
Um, most recent interaction would have been about a month ago, I receive a VA disability and I am a navy reservist so I still drill, I went back on active duty for a year, phone call to stop benefits

    -	**What was that like?** <br>
Good experience. Actually in July. As far as I know my benefit was stopped so it was pretty timely. 

    - **What was the most difficult part of that experience?** <br>
Had to send orders to justify that I was on orders and stopping the benefit. i had to fax them and there’s not confirmation of them receiving the fax. 
Would have liked to get a confirmation. No dialogue that you received it and that benefits stopped. Just had to wait and see if a check showed up. Would have to insure a debt to pay them back. Kinda annoying. No website to say that there’s a confirmation. 

- **Are there any times in your life where you are planning to interact with VA in the future?** <br>
I will have to send them completion orders when I’m done with orders to get my benefits again. It will be the same process again. It’s a little clunky.

  - **Are you planning to retire or separate from service in the next year?** <br>
Stay at least 8 more years, I was just promoted. I can stay for 30 years of service unless I get promoted again. 

- **How would you get information about VA benefits and services?** <br>
I use the VA website. Benefits site login. other than that I use google. 

  -	**What sites?** <br>
My benefits? Ebenifits! 


  - **Have you ever visited a VA website?** <br>
Va.gov if I’m researching general information. I have used my health e vet for disability documentation. 

    - **What were you trying to do last time you visited?** <br>
Look at disability payment. 

    - **Tell me about that experience.** <br>
good. Used it before so I’m familiar with it. It was a good experience. 

    - **Did you create an account?** <br>
yes. e benefits. Kek card. Members I guess. I used education and excused it this last term. I can go back and see my payments. 

kek through dmdc. I don’t use a password and log in anymore. I don’t use a password and login anymore. 



  - **What would expect to find on VA.gov?** <br>
General information. I use google for more specifics. Googled instead of digging through the layers. 

I used it when I was researching my benefits. What I could expect to receive from GI bill. What benefits. Don’t have new benefits at this point, so I don’t have a need to use it. 



## Second Task: Card Sort - 20 minutes

One trend I see is disability claim with healthcare. They can be tied together. For me they are. I used the healthcare system for a little bit, but I stopped because I have private coverage. 

Pension is kinda towards retirement. From my perspective, active duty may leave service but not retire and collect pension. Things I’m done being employed. Add life insurance and burial. 

Records I associate with the medical piece. 

Home loan may be a beast onto it’s own. 

Transition out of service into civilian life. [mil-civ transition]

Health benefits. [health and disability] maybe health care and health care after retirement should be different cards. 

Then things outside those 2 options. End of career. Post military and civilian career. Post 55, 65 age range. [post career / 59+] both military and civilian career. Could also put the retirement healthcare here. 

[VA home loan] its not related to these other things. 



### Follow-up Questions:
- **Which of these cards are the most important to you?** <br>
1. Va home loan, because I recently bought a home with a VA loan. 
2. Gi bill. I’ve excused that for my graduate degree. 
3. I’d have to throw disability in there since I have gone through that process. 

4. Health care. 
5. Pension
The other ones are there, but not that I have to think about. 

I could use burial. We have talked about mortuary stuff. I could see me using that. Life insurance possibly. I have private now, but it could be a benefit along the way. If I need to continue some it would be the most cost effective at some point. 

I’m beyond taps at this point. 

Vocational I have not used that. 

Records, I see that as part of the internal working of the va process. 

- **Any that you were not aware of before today?** <br>

Records I wouldn’t usually consider that. Its the only kind of outlier. 


- **is there anything missing?** <br>

I know of. My graduate degree is a phd and I did a bit of work on VA small business loan. Its not on here, but it’s a cool benefit and it’s appealing. 

That’s probably the only one. 


## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes
- **Do you have any additional questions for me?** <br>
I can’t think of anything. 

## Thank-You and Closing - X minutes
