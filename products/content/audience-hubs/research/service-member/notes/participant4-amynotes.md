## First Task: Benefits Questions - 10 minutes

- **Have you ever used any VA benefits or services?** <br>
So…. No. I think that VA for me, during retirement, I’m still active duty. Op! I think I’ve used the housing one. I was able to get a VA loan. it was very helpful.


  - **Tell me about the last time you interacted with VA.** <br>
I did not interact with VA. My Realtor did. All I did was sign the papers. 

- **Are there any times in your life where you are planning to interact with VA in the future?** <br>
Yes, After my retirement, I will be going to a VA sponsored hospital. 
So far, that’s the only think I know about VA, housing and health care.


  - **Are you planning to retire or separate from service in the next year?** <br>
I have either 8 or 12 more years to go. It’s really up to me. 

- **How would you get information about VA benefits and services?** <br>
So you know a sailor leaves the service, [hold] when a sailor is nearing the end of his enlistment the navy sends them to a week of class, that’s teaching a sailor to be a civilian, you can’t do that in just one week. But they explain it in that week and va is one of those things to do in that week. points of contact. 


  - **Have you ever visited a VA website?** <br>
No, I have not. 

  - **What would expect to find on VA.gov?** <br>
A search bar that’s accurate. I’m in the managerial level here, I like to be able to query a report. I like to be able to query a report in one search. I want everything va loan. 
It helps out a lot. 
And also a representative, a live representative, that’s helpful as well. 
I’m expecting that. I don’t know if thats going to happen. 


## Second Task: Card Sort - 20 minutes

I’m actually a really quiet guy. 

2 groups. One is while you are still in the military. GI Bill, and life insurance and records. Want to make sure the beneficiaries are there and accurate if something were to happen. 

The one in the middle, you’re about to get out, or you’re about to die. 

One is while you’re still active and the other one is when you’re out. 

Group 1: While servicing Group 2: upon separation.


### Follow-up Questions:
- **Which of these cards are the most important to you?** <br>
I passed my GI bill to my daughter. She’s only six, she doesn’t know that she can go to college because of me. Life insurance if something was to happen to me, my wive and children would be taken care of. 

records. So that 

Pre-discharge disability	claim. They don’t say it until they’re about to leave. They don’t get the benefits they need to provide. 

[taps] a lot of my friends say it’s useless, and some say it’s useful, but it’s only seven days. If you’re a sailor for 20 years and it’s only one week. 

a lot of people their number one goal is to receive the pension. 

- **Any that you were not aware of before today?** <br>
That is correct. Maybe not the word is not aware, but not explained well. They’re bunched up in memo. 

I didn’t know about burial in a VA national ceremony, and the VA Vocational and employment benefits, and the career and employment assistance. 

- **Which of these would you see yourself using in the future?** <br>
Ive already used the GI bill. Life insurance, hopefully I don’t die. 

Home loan, yes, I would like to use that, I’m over half of the home loan cut off, so I’d like to use that. 

Taps in mandatory, so I’ll use that whether I like it or not. 

Career and vocational assistance. I might use that. 

Pension I think I’ll use that
