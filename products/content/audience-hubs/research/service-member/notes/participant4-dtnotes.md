## First Task: Benefits Questions - 10 minutes

- **Have you ever used any VA benefits or services?** <br>
No. I think that VA for me is after or during retirement and I’m still on active duty so I don’t think I’ve used any VA benefits…oh, I think I’ve used what do you call it, the housing? I’ve used that one, the VA loan, I was able to get a VA loan. That was very helpful.

  - **Tell me about the last time you interacted with VA.** <br>
So I did not really interact with VA. It was my realtor who interacted with VA. All I did was sign the papers, reviewed the papers and signed them and that was it.

- **Are there any times in your life where you are planning to interact with VA in the future?** <br>
Yes. So I think that after my retirement, I’ll be going to a VA-sponsored hospital. So we’ll see about that.

  -	**Do you think you’ll use anything other than health care?** <br>
  Umm, what else…so far, that’s the only thing I know about VA, housing and health care. That’s all I know about Veterans Affairs.

- **And you’re not planning on entering retirement anytime soon, right?** <br>
I have either 8 or 12 more years to go. It’s really up to me.

-	**If you were getting near retirement or looking to get a VA benefit, how would you get info about VA?** <br>
You know, before a sailor leaves the service…hold on, please…*[pause]*… Sorry about that. What was the question again, I’m sorry?

    -	**How would you get information about VA?** <br>
  When a sailor is nearing his end of enlistment, the Navy actually takes care of the sailors by sending them to a week of class for teaching them how to become a civilian. You can’t teach somebody who’s been in the Navy for 20 years how to become a civilian in a week. But they teach you what to do when you’re about to leave, who to contact, points of contact, and VA is part of that.

  -	**Have you visited a VA website?** <br>
  No, I have not.
    -	**If you were to visit VA.gov, what would you expect to see there?** <br>
  A search bar that is accurate because I’m at the managerial level over here and I like to see—when I’m looking for something, I just want to be able to query a report. I just want to input what I want in one search bar. On a website, what I want is to put something in, for example, “VA loans,” and get everything for VA loans—the process for getting a VA loan, the requirements for getting a VA loan. That’s just what I want, a search bar. It helps out a lot.
  Also, an active, live representative if there is one, that’s helpful as well.
    -	**Anything else?** <br>
  No, that’s it. That’s just what I want, what I would expect. I don’t know if that’s going to happen.

## Second Task: Card Sort - 20 minutes

***[creates 1 category with Health Care and Disability (on right), and 1 with GI Bill, Life Insurance, Records, and Home Loans (on left)]*** Right now, I have 2 groups–1 is on the left. To me, it’s while you’re still active, still in the military, you want to make sure your GI Bill beneficiaries are set, your Life Insurance beneficiaries are set. If something were to happen, you want to make sure the beneficiaries are there and correct and accurate.

***[creates another category (in the middle) for Burials, TAP, Careers and Employment, Voc Rehab, and Veterans Pension]*** The one in the middle, I put in there if you are about to get out or you’re about to die.

***[moves Disability and Health Care into the middle group]*** Now I just have 2 groups: 1 is while you’re still active, and the other 1 is when you’re about to leave the service.

***[finalizes groups and labels them as below]***

-	**Checklist while serving**
  -	GI Bill
  -	Life Insurance
  -	Records
  -	Home Loans
-	**Checklist upon separation**
  -	Burials
  -	TAP
  -	Careers and Employment
  -	Voc Rehab
  -	Veterans Pension
  -	Health Care
  -	Disability

### Follow-up Questions:

- **Which of these cards are the most important to you?** <br>
To me, can I choose how many I want or just one?

  -	**As many as you’d like.** <br>
  So the GI Bill and other Education benefits, that’s very important for me. One because through tuition assistance, I was able to get my degree. And now I’ve passed my GI Bill to my daughter. She’s only 6 now, but she’ll be able to go to whatever college she wants with that. <br>
The Life Insurance, hopefully I don’t need it. But if something is to happen to me, my wife and my kids are taken care of while I’m in the service. And same thing for them, if something  happens to them, they have FSGLI. <br>
Records, of course,  if the records are not good, it’s going to take time before you get these benefits. So that one is the most important. <br>
VA home loan, that was pretty easy to get because I got it through the realtor. <br> Pre-discharge disability claim I think is also pretty important because some military members get hurt while they’re in the service, but they don’t see it until they’re ready to leave, or they don’t see it all even after they leave if they’re invalid,  if they still need to work and they don’t get the benefits they need to provide.
Burial in a VA cemetery is not really important for me. <br> TAP, like I said, one week of training for a military service member, I think it’s useless. But some of my friends say they learned something from it, but also a lot say it’s useless. For me, I say you have a 20-year sailor and you’re only going to give 7 days of classes, that’s a waste. <br>
Careers and employment assistance is not really important because while the military member is still on activity duty, he could still make a network so when the time comes to retire, it’s easy to get a job. We do that all the time here. There are jobs everywhere I think. <br>
Vocational rehabilitation and employment, I think that goes with careers and employment assistance. <br> Veterans pension, that’s important too because a lot of military members who retire, that is their #1 goal, to receive pension. <br> And then health care, not really important to me unless I am away from the naval base.

- **Any that you were not aware of before today?** <br>
So that is correct. Maybe the words are not aware, maybe not, I guess, not explained well. I think they are just bunched up in 1 idea. <br>
For example, when a military member gets out, okay is the pre-discharge disability claim there, is the tap class there? I think they’re all there. But to answer your question, I didn’t know about…*[pause]*…burial in a VA national cemetery and the vocational rehabilitation as well as careers and employment assistance. 

  -	**Any others?** <br>
  That’s all.

-	**Now that you’ve seen this list and, thinking about the discussion we had earlier, which of these do you see yourself using in the future?** <br>
Well, I’ve already used the GI Bill, so that’s one. <br> Life insurance, hopefully no one dies and I don’t have to use it. But if something was to happen, then yes, I would like to use it. <br>
VA home loan, yes, I would like to use that because I’m over half of what the cut off is for a VA home loan so I’m hoping to use the other half. <br> Pre-discharge disability claim, hopefully I’m qualified. <br>
The TAP program, for us it’s mandatory, so I’m going to use it whether I want it or not. <br> Careers and assistance, I might use it. I don’t think I’m going to need it, but I might. Same for vocational rehabilitation.
<br> Pension, I think I’m going to use that after retirement. <br> Health care, if not for Tricare, then I guess I’m going to use the VA one.
