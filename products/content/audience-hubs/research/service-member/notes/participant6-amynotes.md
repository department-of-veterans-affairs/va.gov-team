## First Task: Benefits Questions - 10 minutes

- **Have you ever used any VA benefits or services?** <br>
You know, I’ve used several benefits though army, some of them are from VA, I believe I have. The Home loan certificate, I have that. Is tuition assistance through the VA? 

Army, active duty.

Not offhand. I basically only take advantage of tuition assistance and I have the mortgage certificate. 


  - **Tell me about the last time you interacted with VA.** <br>
I didn’t. It was a 3rd party financial advisor who guided me through everything. We mailed in a form. Got my notification in the mail. 


- **Are there any times in your life where you are planning to interact with VA in the future?** <br>
Other benefits that I’m not aware of. When I get out of the army, I will have I pretty good relationship with you guys. a while before I separate from army, but more than likely it will be a while. 

  - **Are you planning to retire or separate from service in the next year?** <br>

- **How would you get information about VA benefits and services?** <br>
well. I will tell you this. To be honest with you. I would hope through the process of exiting the army there will be a whole class on how to be with the VA. but I’m completely clueless. But if not I’d be left on my own to use the Internet and call and figure it out. 

I’d use google.


  - **Have you ever visited a VA website?** <br>
Hazardous air quality registry. I deployed in 2017 to Afghanistan and I logged on to participate in the registry. I got a letter in the mail that



    - **Tell me about that experience.** <br>
80% of personnel had chronic severe symptoms, debilitation at time. Was advised that there’s this registry. logged personal experience in the registry. 

    - **Did you create an account?** <br>
yes. If I remember. Don’t remember the exact title of the website. I googled. It. “VA hazardous registry” and it popped up somewhere. 


  - **What would expect to find on VA.gov?** <br>
At this time. I wouldn’t be actively looking for that I would find on the website. I would see a reference to the airborne registry, healthcare, pictures of past service member. Comparable to a hospitals website geared specifically to service memebers. 



## Second Task: Card Sort - 20 minutes

I almost want to put them all in one group. They all kinda seem like the would go under the same group title of transition with the exception of burial and records. 

Transition benefits and assistance. All kinda the same thing. Getting out of the military you might be looking for [TAPS, employment, vocational, health care, pension] 

Pre-transition
[home loan, go bill]

What is a good word for paperwork stuff? Lets go with FAQ’s. 
[records, disability, life insurance, burial]


### Follow-up Questions:
- **Which of these cards are the most important to you?** <br>
I would base it off of my personal life, top 3 would be. They’re all so close, they blanket over each other a bit here, career and employment assistance, health care, pension, VA home loan. A really close second would be education benefits. 

- **Any that you were not aware of before today?** <br>
Yeah, I would say, I did not know that you guys did anything with transition. The employment assistance I didn’t know about that. Pension id dint know. 

I’m not super informed about the FAQ section but I knew about them. 


- **Which of these would you see yourself using in the future?** <br>

Hopefully I won’t need to look into the burial part myself. I’m like a coupon collector type of person. Id take advantage of whatever I’m eligible for. 
Employment, pension, career, I’d imaging id have some sort of disability claim. I’d need some sort of life insurance. I’d use all of them with the exception of burial. 

- **Is there anything missing from this list** <br>
Hard to answer. I wasn’t aware of some of these. Seems pretty through. Hit different facets and primary concerns of what people would have in their life. Nothing like “what to expect with your health care process” but I imagine thats under health care somewhere. 

If I had to say something was missing, its more in the way it was listed. They’re very black and white. I would expect more of a user friendly welcoming aspect here. That’s not here. 


## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes
- **Do you have any additional questions for me?** <br>

[explains TAPS program, service member asked about it earlier] 

Not really any additional questions. Do you guys assist people in finding jobs?

## Thank-You and Closing - X minutes
