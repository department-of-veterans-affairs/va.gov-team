## Second Task: Card Sort - 20 minutes
Take care of before you retire. Pre-retirement group: TAPS, Pre-discharge disability, life insurance. (Didn’t know you could go to taps before retirement, you can do it twice. Would have wanted to know a lot of the TAPS information  like 2 years before his separation, would like to have known what to get ready for)

The word benefits is used a lot. Maybe a benefits group. Vocational rehab and employment, pension, Home loan, GI Bill, Burial.

Records is it’s own group. Listing types of records the VA might have. 

### Folllow-up Questions:

Pre-seporation is a large category, Benefits is a sub-category of that. 

- Any that you were not aware of before today?
No, was aware of all of them.

- Which of these would you see yourself using in the future?
All of them. The VA is a resource, vital importance to anyone in the military. People who don’t use them are missing out. We sacrificed a lot, it’s nice to get a little back.
