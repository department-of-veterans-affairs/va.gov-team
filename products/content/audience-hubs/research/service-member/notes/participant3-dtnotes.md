## First Task: Benefits Questions - 10 minutes

- **Have you ever used any VA benefits or services?** <br>
Yes. I’ve got a VA mortgage and I recently started using my GI Bill to take classes.

  - **Tell me about the last time you interacted with VA.** <br>
Directly, I guess a couple days ago for classes.
    -	**What was that like?** <br>
It was on the phone and it was pretty straightforward. The person explained everything I needed to do to start the process.
    - **What was the most difficult part of that experience?** <br>
I can’t really recall it being very difficult. It all seemed pretty easy.

- **Are there any times in your life where you are planning to interact with VA in the future?** <br>
Yes. I’m working on submitting a disability claim. I talked to a VA rep from my state, so I’ll follow up with that and then additionally more classes.
  - **Are you planning to retire or separate from service in the next year?** <br>
I’ve already retired.

- **How would you get information about VA benefits and services?** <br>
Usually through the Internet. I’ve got some bookmarks for different VA websites that I go to.

  -	**What sites?** <br>
On like the different state sites for their Veterans Affairs, VA benefits for school and for disability.

  - **Have you ever visited a VA website?** <br>
Like VA.gov? yes.
    - **What were you trying to do last time you visited?** <br>
Let’s see *[pause]* I was trying to figure out how to get education benefits and find a person to help me. I forget what they’re called, a person to help you fill out forms to get benefits…I also got a copy of my DD214.
    - **Tell me about that experience.** <br>
I mostly go to benefits.va.gov. It’s pretty easy to navigate. Everything’s pretty much where I’m looking for it.
    - **Did you create an account?** <br>
I did, yes.
    -	**Tell me about that experience.** <br>
I created it a while ago. It was pretty easy as far as I remember, pretty straightforward. I used my common access card and then I created my DS Logon and that gave me access to what I wanted.
  - **What would expect to find on VA.gov?** <br>
I guess I would expect that to be the big things that most people are looking for. Most stuff is there—health care, disability, things that I’ve generally looked for in the past. I forgot to mention, I have looked up health care information there, I’ve used it to find that.

-	**How long ago did you retire?** <br>
Almost a year ago—the first of May.

## Second Task: Card Sort - 20 minutes

***[moves Voc Rehab to its own category]*** Vocational rehabilitation and employment benefits seems like a pretty broad group. <br>

***[begins moving several over]*** Right now, I see these as 3 different groups. I guess want to pull everything out and just kind of look over it all.<br> 

***[creates a category of TAP, Life Insurance, and Disability]*** This all seems like stuff you want to take care of before you retire.<br>

***[creates a category of GI Bill, Health Care, Burials, Home Loans]*** I’m seeing here that the word “benefits” is repeating over and over, so I’m creating like a list of benefits group.<br>

***[creates a category of TAP, Careers, Records, Life Insurance, Disability, and Health Care and labels it “Pre-Retirement Information”]*** And then TAP, these are things to do prior to retirement. 

***[creates a category of Voc Rehab, Pension, GI Bill, Burials and labels it “Benefits”]*** These are all different benefits that are available.<br>

***[creates a category just for Records]***

-	**Can you explain what you mean by “Pre-retirement”?** <br>
Before you actually start TAPs. I didn’t know that you could actually go to TAPs before retirement. You’re able to do TAPs twice, I believe, so I think it’d be good to do it once sort of around the middle of your career so you can prepare and then a second time when you’re really getting out. I remember being in the class and thinking, “Man, I wish I could’ve known about this before so I could’ve taken care of some of things.” Maybe 2 years before separating, being able to know what to be ready for to transition and then the actual transition assistance.

    -	**Is that anything that your department or DOD helps with?** <br>
They do TAPs just before you separate. It starts, I think, a year before you separate—whether you’re retiring or getting out of enlistment. So I was kind of regretting that I wasn’t able to see things before—like some of the GI Bill information I didn’t know prior to getting ready to get out. It may have been mentioned, but I didn’t remember—like transitioning to dependents, the Air Force says you have to have 4 years of remaining service to transfer benefits. I didn’t know that before I enlisted, and then they said you need to have 4 years of remaining service. So I kind of got screwed out of transferring my benefits to my daughter. It may have been mentioned, but it wasn’t given the importance it should have been before re-enlisting.

-	**Can you explain the "Benefits" category?** <br>
So these are all things I think are kind of unique to the VA. And I’m still kind of working things out as I’m thinking about it. 
Knowing I can be buried in a VA cemetery instead of a private one…
Most people know about the GI Bill, but not about the other benefits…like eligibility for a VA loan; I have a VA loan, but a lot of people I’ve talked to don’t. I don’t think a lot of people understand what that is and it’s a very important benefit for people…. 
Pension benefits get confused with the whole percentages and VA ratings.
And then Vocational Rehabilitation is kind of between the 2 so  I wasn’t sure where to put it. I learned about it during TAPs. It’s being able to get additional training like small business training and training to transition your military skills to the nearest civilian careers. You’re in the military, and now you’re transitioning out.

-	**And "Records"?** <br>
Medical records for your disability, educational records, DD214, stuff like that, kind of just a library of history I guess.

### Follow-up Questions:

- **Which of these cards are the most important to you?** <br>
It depends where I’m at in my career.
Pre-retirement is in general a big header. If I could put another under it, I would almost put benefits as a subcategory just because when you’re getting ready to separate or retire, you need to know about TAPs, and then benefits, and then how to make your claim before you leave.

***[note: participants renames this category “Pre-separation Information”]***

- **Can you explain "retire" vs. "separation"?** <br>
So separation is you can do the minimum enlisted (in the Air Force it’s 4 years), and then you can separate. There are certain benefits you can receive. You can still get transition assistance…at any point you can separate without retiring.
To retire, you have to do at least 20 years and then get approved. And then you would get retirement benefits in addition that are more than just separation benefits.

- **Any that you were not aware of before today?** <br>
No, I was aware of all of these.

- **Which of these would you see yourself using in the future?** <br>
Honestly, all of them. The VA is a resource for anybody in the military. Anybody that doesn’t take advantage of any of these things is missing out. They’re all designed to help us people in the military. We’ve given a lot to the country and it’s nice to get a little bit back in returned.

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

- **Do you have any additional questions for me?** <br>
Not at the moment. I’m sure I can think of something along the way.

## Thank-You and Closing - X minutes
