## First Task: Benefits Questions - 10 minutes

- **Have you ever used any VA benefits or services?** <br>
I used the Montgomery GI Bill, the Post-9/11. As far as anything else, I’m trying to think if I’ve used any in the past. Not for me personally, but I think my grandma has used funeral services and stuff like that. But me personally, just the GI Bill.

  - **Tell me about the last time you interacted with VA.** <br>
  The last…*[pause]*…I think I came back from a deployment and we kind of went through a post-deployment kind of a meeting, and they just talked about some things—injuries, benefits, disability, stuff like that. But that might be the last time I associated with them. I think I have to do something in the future. It’s going to be a yellow ribbon awards thing, and I think I have to go to a lot of meetings, but that hasn’t happened yet.
  
  -	**When did you use the GI Bill?** <br>
  Starting from roughly 2012 to about roughly 2017, I believe. I think that’s when it was fully extinguished.  I used the whole thing. <br>
  
  -	**Tell me about that experience.** <br>
  Yeah, well, I got off of active duty, and I started working. And they’d always told me that I had my GI Bill, but I never really planned on going to school. But I guess I hit a point in my career where I said, I guess I’d better go to school. I remember looking it up on online, calling 800 numbers, and them telling me, you can go to school. And every school has a VA representative  who works not for VA, but with VA, and they were able to give me all the information I needed. It was way easier…I only had to fill out one sheet of paper and bam! I was enrolled in school. And I never had any trouble with payments or anything. <br>
  
  - **What was the most difficult part of that experience?** <br>
  There was a time…I’m a reservist, and I got deployed, and when I got deployed, I had…I take that back. I wasn’t deployed. I had to go for some type of training, and it was kind of long—4 months or so. And it was for the Air Force Reserves. And while I was deployed, I was staying at a hotel on base, and I was using the government travel card. And the payments to get that card paid was between me and my unit, and they were always finding discrepancies, and they still saw that debt being shown. And the VA was like, “We can’t pay for your school unless you clean up that debt from your unit.” It wasn’t the VA’s fault. I don’t necessarily blame the VA…it’s good really…it was just something I had to fix. After I fixed it, they even back paid me so it was fine. <br>

- **Are there any times in your life where you are planning to interact with VA in the future?** <br>
Umm, that’s a good question. I forgot to mention, I used a VA loan for my house. I don’t know why I didn’t mention that. I probably would consider doing another VA loan for the house. Maybe if I’m disabled. I’m not currently, but if it were to happen, I would do it. But if I were to do it again, it probably would be something along the lines of a VA loan for the house. <br>

- **When are you planning to retire?** <br>
Yeah, so I’ve got about 14 years in. I’m probably going to do at least 6, so we’ll see how it goes there. I’ll probably retire, yeah….in another 6, I would be eligible for retirement.

-	**If you were getting near retirement or looking to get a VA benefit, how would you get info about VA?** <br>
For me personally, if I was just looking at it, I probably would check on the Internet first. I probably would talk to others who had done it or were familiar with the process. If they didn’t have the information, I would probably go to the person in my unit…they’d direct you…probably would talk to the purser or chaplain or someone in my unit…sometimes I know that if you kind of want to interact with the VA, you don’t have to really interact with them but with the businesses they have contacts with. VA, they kind of try to cut out being the middleman. When I did my home loan, I didn’t have to talk with someone at the VA. The guy was just like, “Yeah, we’ve done VA loans before,” and that was that.

    -	**So you just worked with the realtor.** <br>
    Yeah, that was one of the first things I asked them. I was like, “Do you do VA loans?” And they were like, “Yeah.” They had additional paperwork from VA. I think VA needed some stuff to prove—some requirements, but once they got that, it was good to go.
  
-	**Have you visited a VA website?** <br>
Yeah. I remember looking up the VA website because I used to be on active duty. And then when my GI Bill extinguished, there’s also a Reserve GI Bill, and I was looking up that. 

    -	**Do you remember which website it was?** <br>
    It was something along the lines of…I remember going to VA.gov, and then within there it was some kind of educational page….and then you click that and it gives you all the information and then you just kind of find…then they ask you if you’re Reserve or National Guard…and then it gets more specific with every click.

    -	**What was the most difficult part of that experience?** <br>
    Umm, I don’t think it was very hard only cause not only does the VA put out that information, your unit talks about it. Other people talk about it. So it wasn’t like I was in the dark about it. So even though I’d never done it before, it wasn’t like I was alone doing it. It’s kind of like once you do it, not like a lot of stuff changes….it always seems to stay pretty rigid, which I guess is kind of good.

    -	**Did you create an account?** <br>
    Umm, I get like some type of monthly email. And they just kind of talk about VA things in general , charities. They always talk about like different, I don’t know, cases with maybe like Congress and stuff like that. I don’t know if I have an account, but they definitely give me some kind of newsletter. I may have an account, but I don’t even know the username and password.
  
-	**Have you ever visited a different VA website, like eBenefits or My HealtheVet?** <br>
  That does sound familiar. Yeah, I want to say I do have some kind of account because every once in a while when we get activated, we get Tricare. And then when we get off of active orders, I have my DD214. So I must have something, but I don’t know off the top of my head, sorry.

- **If you were to visit VA.gov in the future, what information would you expect to find there?** <br>
VA.gov, to me, is usually like a good, like the way it’s set up, you literally just go, “I just want to know benefits about”…it has a drop box of disability, etc. It’s very broad, and then the more you click, it just gets more specific for you…I’d like help with retirement ….in my opinion , it’s very good. It just seems like well-rounded, where anybody could do it. It makes it so simple, maybe even too simple for people who are kind of savvy with it.

## Second Task: Card Sort - 20 minutes

I kind of like the way it’s ordered now actually. <br>

***[moves GI Bill over to start a category]*** Starting from the top, GI Bill. The way I’m kind of thinking about that is that that’s something you could use when you’re in. It’s something current to somebody. It just seems like something that’s active right now, as opposed to something like pension benefits that doesn’t occur until later. <br>

***[moves Pension into its own category]*** I’d put that in the bottom. I’d put that in a different group. <br>

***[moves Records over with Pension]*** Records, I would consider putting inside that pension benefits…Probably the pension benefits on top. <br>

***[moves Life Insurance over with Records and Pension]*** Life insurance options and eligibility, I’d probably put that inside the pension benefits. That kind of seems like they’re hand in hand. <br>

***[moves Burials over with Records, Pension, and Life Insurance]*** Burials, you can put that inside the pensions because that’s kind of a part of the deal. <br>

***[moves Health Care over into its own category]*** Health care after separation, I’d probably put that in its own box.  <br>

***[moves Voc Rehab over with Health Care]*** I would probably put that vocational rehabilitation in the same box with the health care.  <br>

***[moves TAP over with Health Care and Voc Rehab]*** And I would also put, talk about separation and retirement, so that transition program, TAP, you can put that in the same box since it’s kind of talking about transition. <br>

And then what else do we got here? <br>

***[moves Career and Employment over with TAP, Health Care, and Voc Rehab]*** Career and employment, you could probably put that inside that health care box.  <br>

***[moves Home Loan over with GI Bill]*** And then for that certificate of eligibility for a VA home loan, you can put that with the GI Bill. <br>

And then disability, you can almost put that with both the pension or the health care box. Yeah. If I had to choose, I would probably put that in that health care box. ***[moves Disability over with TAP, Health Care, and Voc Rehab]*** <br>

I feel pretty comfortable with the way those are kind of ordered.  <br>

***[moderator prompts participant to label the boxes]*** <br>

I almost think about it in terms of the age of the Veteran. <br>

Education, a middle age or younger service member could use. <br>

Second would be, this guy’s probably maybe done. Retired. And maybe they just need to look over their benefits and check over their life insurance and burial for their family. <br>

And then health care, that kind of seems perfect for someone who is just retiring. Like maybe they just did their 20 years of service, and they just kind of need that initial help or assistance. That seems like the way to go. <br>

***[referring to grouping of GI Bill and Home Loan]*** I was thinking about it in terms of age. Wow, what would I call this? We could say uh, Veterans…what the heck would I call this…I almost want to say something along the lines of, “Current Benefits You Can Use.” Like, you don’t necessarily have to do 20 years to use your GI Bill or VA loan. <br>

***[moderator asks participant to confirm order of grouping]*** <br>

Yeah. That’s how I would prefer it personally. <br>

***[referring to the grouping of Pension, Records, Life Insurance, Burials]*** This one would be used for more of the—I want to say this would be for like the older Veteran. Like the guy who like maybe went to Vietnam or the Korean War or something like that. I hate to say it, but maybe his better days are behind him, and he’s trying to get some records and stuff.  “Benefits for the Older Veteran” or something along that line. <br>

And then this order is pretty good. And then you end it with burial so that’s perfect. <br>

***[referring to the grouping of Health Care, Voc Rehab, TAP, Career and Employment, Disability]*** This last one, I would almost call this like, “The Recently Retired Veteran.” Like if you’re near retirement or just retired, this section would be ideal for that person. <br>

***[moderator asks participant to confirm order of groupings]*** <br>

You could switch 2 and 3. So it looks like you’re starting from the left. You could switch this whole box so it just kind of looks like it goes from younger to middle to older. <br>

***[moderator asks participant to confirm order of individual cards within groupings]*** <br>

***[referring to the “Recently Retired Veteran” grouping]*** I’m happy with the order in the 2nd box…You could probably put that pre-discharge disability claim above health care. All the way to the top. ***[moves Disability up to the top]*** So that’s the transition. Yeah, I like the way that looks actually. Yeah, I think everything looks right now. <br>

***[moderator relays back info–referring to “Current Benefits You Can Use” grouping: What I heard you say was these are things you can use while you’re still within the military system]*** <br>

Yeah. You could only have like 1 or 2 years in, and these benefits anybody could use. <br>

***[moderator relays back info–referring to “Recently Retired Veteran” grouping: And then the 2nd box we said was for the Veteran who recently retired. And by recently, do you mean active to reserve or fully retired from the military?]*** <br>

You could almost do both. That’s a good point. You could say, “Recently Retired or Near Retirement.” Like things you should know or things that could help you. <br>

***[moderator changes label to “Near Retirement or Recently Retired Veteran”]*** <br>

Yeah, that looks good.

***[moderator relays back info—referring again to the “Near Retirement or Recently Retired Veteran” grouping: So this box has all of the things that you feel that if you’re about to be discharged from the military, post reserve, post active duty, as well as things you might use in your first few years as a new Veteran.]***

Yeah, I would agree with that.

***[moderator relays back info—referring to the “Benefits for the Older Veteran” grouping: This last group these are things you’re anticipating for later in life]*** <br> 

Yeah. He may have already been retired for 10 years, 15 years, 20 years. These would probably be more like burials. No one ever thinks about that early or in the middle. But definitely, like life insurance, like an older person. <br>

If you’ve recently retired, I’m sure you have your records. But if you’re older, you may have lost them. <br>

Pension benefits—maybe something changed in the rates or the tax or something along those lines, and it might be something you need. <br>

***[finalizes order as follows]***

-	**Current Benefits You Can Use**
    - GI Bill and Other Education Benefits
    - Certificate of Eligibility for a VA-backed Home Loan
- **Near Retirement or Recently Retired Veteran**
    - Pre-Discharge Disability Claim
    -	Health Care After Separation or Retirement
    -	Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Benefits
    -	Transition Assistance Program (TAP)
    -	Career and Employment Assistance
-	**Benefits for the Older Veteran**
    -	Veterans Pension Benefits
    -	Records
    -	Life Insurance Options and Eligibility
    -	Burial in a VA National Cemetery

### Follow-up Questions:

- **Which of these cards are the most important to you?** <br>
For me? For myself, I already extinguished my GI Bill. I already used my VA loan. I guess I’d have to look at that middle one for myself *[referring to the “Near Retirement or Recently Retired Veteran” grouping]*. If something were to happen to me, I lose my hearing or something like that, I’d want to look at this health care maybe….if I do retire, I’d probably try to get a new job outside of  this one, so I’d have to think about something along those lines. So yeah, that middle one suits me. <br>

  - **Any specific cards?** <br>
  Let’s see. I guess pre-discharge disability claim. You know, that might come in handy out of all the other ones. The other ones, I feel like I could potentially find that information outside of the VA. But that pre-discharge disability claim, I wouldn’t want to come anywhere else except for VA for that. <br>

- **Any that you were not aware of before today?** <br>
Let’s see. I’ve always known about TAP. I want to say I’m somewhat familiar with all of these in some kind of way. Nothing is necessarily new to me.

- **Any others you might use in the future?** <br>
I’d like to say maybe the life insurance option cause I currently use the SGLI, I think they call it. So maybe later after I retired, they’d make me switch it. I think that’s only eligible to those still serving. So maybe life insurance down the road, but it would definitely be later down the road. </br></br> I guess the burial, though I typically see, like, family members usually do that instead of the actual recipient themselves. So maybe I’d tell my family about that, just so they know about that. </br></br> I think that’s about all...the GI Bill, I’ve already used that. Yeah, I don’t think, in all honesty, I hope I don’t have to use any of them. I know there might be a case…pension, eventually I’ll use that too, of course. Pension benefits, just figuring out at what age, what I’ll be earning and stuff like that for tax reasons and stuff.

- **Anything missing?** <br>
I’m trying to think. Missing. I mean this is really—I think of the VA, I mean maybe you could just have something like a VA hospital cause I know there’s a lot of VA hospitals out there. So maybe like VA hospitals or VA treatment centers or something like that. That’s the only thing that stands out as missing. Again, that would be tied into health care. There could be a tab in there easily. </br></br> I think the VA does a good job in making things as easy as possible.
