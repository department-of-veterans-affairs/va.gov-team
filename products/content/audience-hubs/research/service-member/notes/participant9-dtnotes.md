## First Task: Benefits Questions - 10 minutes

- **Have you ever used any VA benefits or services?** <br>
Uh, yes, the GI Bill.

  - **When?** <br>
  Uh, I started using the GI Bill first term last year, so January of last year. And I’ve continued to use it since then.
  
  - **Tell me about the last time you interacted with VA.** <br>
  That would be requesting my GI Bill benefits this semester. So late December, early January.  
  
    - **How did that go? Can you tell me about that experience?** <br>
    Umm, sure. Uh, in order to use the GI Bill, I just need to fill out a form on the VA website, VA ED, or I don’t recall the exact website. You just kind of go there, manipulate your way to requesting benefits, and fill out the form, your school information, send it to VA, and then you do other paperwork with the school you’re attending with the VA representative at your school. And I guess they kind of sync up together as the benefits *[laughs]*.
    
    - **What was the most difficult part of the experience?** <br>
    Getting to the actual paperwork on the VA website that I need to fill out. It’s kind of confusing. There are several different links. And if you’ve never done it before, it’s kind of confusing where you need to go.
    
    - **Do you remember which site that was that you were on?** <br>
    Let me see here. I can do it here real quick and see. I believe it’s VA.gov/education.
    
    - **So you were finding it challenging figuring out what you need to fill out?** <br>
    Yes. It prompts you as a return user to go ahead and fill out a form. But as a new user, it’s difficult to find out where you need to go. 
    
- **Are there times in the future when you're planning to use the VA website again?** <br>    
Yes, probably when I’m applying for how would you say…*[pause]*…you know, when you get out of the military, it recommends you go to the VA to claim disability or see what your disability points would be. I kind of looked around the VA website when I got off of active duty, but then I went back to the Reserves and I was kind of confused about whether I could get benefits…so once I get out of the Reserves, I’m sure I’ll be going through it again as far as seeing what my disability is or what I’m eligible for at that point.

- **When are you planning to retire?** <br>
Currently my contract is through 2023. At that point, I’ll probably sign another 6-year contract to get my 20 years. So it’ll be 2029.

-	**If you were getting near retirement or looking to get a VA benefit, how would you get info about VA?** <br>
Uh, on the education side I keep an active—talk actively with the VA representatives through the school I’m attending. With other Veterans benefits, it’s really just Google searching and looking at other questions other people have posted in the past and going through links that way.

- **Have you used any other websites like eBenefits or My HealtheVet?** <br>
I remember I’ve gone through eBenefits before. I don’t exactly remember why I was looking at it. It probably was recommended when I was getting off of active duty. I remember going there. I don’t think I ever did any substantial amount of business on there.

- **Can you tell me about your experience on VA websites?** <br>
The websites are confusing. And I say that because there are so many out there. It links you…I mean, you search on “VA benefits.” A number of pages come up, and it’s just overwhelming almost because you don’t know where to go for exactly what you need.

- **Do you have a VA website account?** <br>
Umm, I don’t think I do.
  - **When you filled out that returning education form, you didn't log into anything to do that?** <br>
  Oh, that I do. It’s ID…*[pause]* ID.me?
  - **Okay, you use an ID.me account.** <br>
  Yes.
    
-	**If you were to visit VA.gov in the future, what would you expect to see there?** <br>
Uh, I would say, obviously, I would want an easy link to the GI Bill or education benefits. I would think there…*[pause]*…Honestly, when I think of it, I would like it to be a pull-down menu:  GI Bill benefits, Health Care benefits, Disability, something that would be very easy to navigate. It doesn’t seem like it would be very complicated to set it up that way, but…
    
## Second Task: Card Sort - 20 minutes

***[moves Health Care over to its own category]*** All right, the first thing that jumps out to me is the health care after separation, just thinking along the lines of health care.  <br>

***[moves Life Insurance over with Health Care]*** And then, obviously, I’d go insurance, life insurance, I’d put that here. <br>

***[moves Burials over with Health Care and Life Insurance]*** You know, it’s rough, but since we’re dealing with health care, I’d want to throw burials in that same group. <br>

Then just thinking about getting out of the military, I’m thinking what would be good there. <br>

***[moves TAP over to its own category]*** You have TAP. <br>

***[moves Disability over with TAP]*** Then pre-discharge disability claim because that’s when you’re getting out. <br>

***[moves Career and Employment over with TAP and Disability]*** Then career and employment assistance since that’s setting yourself up for the future there. <br>

***[moves GI Bill to its own category]*** Let’s see. I want GI Bill to be in its own little area there. <br>

***[moves Home Loan to its own category]*** Let’s see here. I’m going to put—housing doesn’t really go in any of those other 3. Let’s put it over here.  <br>

***[moves Pension over with TAP, Disability, and Career and Employment]*** Veterans pension benefits, I think that would go in with getting out of the military, with folks retiring, with TAP. <br>

***[moves Career and Employment out of grouping and into its own category; then moves Voc Rehab over with Career and Employment]*** Actually, I’m going to move career and employment assistance to its own, and I’ll put vocational rehabilitation there because you’re thinking about future employment there. <br>

***[moves Records to its own category]*** I’ve left records for last because it doesn’t say what kind of records, whether it’s health care records or whatever. I’ll put that in its own group just because I don’t understand what kind of records. <br>

***[labels grouping of TAP, Disability, and Pension]*** I think a good name for this first group is “Transition and Benefits.” <br>

***[labels grouping of Career and Employment and Voc Rehab]*** I would put “Employment” for this one. <br>

***[labels grouping of just GI Bill and Other Education benefits]*** And this one is going to be “Education.” <br>

***[labels grouping of just Home Loan Certificate]*** “Home Loan” for this one. It’s by itself. <br>

***[labels grouping of Health Care, Life Insurance, and Burials]*** I’d say this one is “Health Care and Insurance.” <br>

***[labels grouping of just Records]*** And once again, records. But since I don’t know what kind of records its indicating, I’m just going to keep “Records” there. <br>

And that takes care of the 11.

***[finalizes groups and labels them as below]***

- **Health Care and Insurance**
  - Health Care After Separation or Retirement
  - Life Insurance Options and Eligibility
  - Burial in a VA National Cemetery
- **Transition and Benefits**
  - Transition Assistance Program (TAP)
  - Pre-Discharge Disability Claim
  - Veterans Pension Benefits
- **Employment**
  - Career and Employment Assistance
  - Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Benefits
- **Education**
  - GI Bill and Other Education Benefits
- **Home Loan**
  - Certificate of Eligibility for a VA-backed Home Loan
- **Records**
  - Records
  
-	**What do you think would fall under Records?** <br>
Obviously, it could encompass health records. I think it could also encompass any of the documents uploaded into iPERMS while you’re in the military. Promotion, order, that kind of stuff. That’s why I was just kind of confused. I didn’t know which kind of way it was going. If I had to guess, I would think health records, but I just wasn’t sure. It could also be your DD214.

  -	**If you could rename it, assuming that it was all encompassing, what would you call it?** <br>
  Obviously, if it was health care and insurance, I would put maybe “Medical Records.” Or if it was more along the lines of official military records, it could be “Military Documents” or something along those lines.

  -	**Would you expect to find those things in the same place or in different places?** <br>
  I would like to see them in one place. *[laughs]* But knowing how the government works with the separation of offices, I would assume they would be in separate places when I went looking for them. But it would be easier if they were in one place.

### Follow-up Questions:

- **Which of these cards are the most important to you right now?** <br>
Right now, I would say...ooh let me think about it. Obviously, education. If records was all encompassing, I think that would be helpful. And then transition and benefits.

- **Any that you were not aware of before today?** <br>
Umm, let’s see. I wasn’t certain that there was the burial in a VA national cemetery. I mean, it makes sense that’s it’s there, but I wouldn’t think to go to the VA website to look for that information.
  -	**Where would you look for it?** <br>
  You know, I hadn’t really thought of it. I hadn’t really thought of it. It’s just something that wouldn’t have crossed my mind to look for there. You know, what I would say is that if I was looking for information on Arlington, most likely I’d Google, “Arlington National Cemetery burials,” and then navigate over from their website and then meander over from there to VA.
  - **So you would look locally first?** <br>
  Yes, exactly.
  
- **Which of these benefits do you see yourself using in the future?** <br>
Umm, let’s see. Pre-discharge disability claim. I’m gonna continue to use the GI Bill. And at some point, I would use the home loan, certificate of eligibility for a VA home loan.

  - **Any others?** <br>
  I think if records was all encompassing, I could see myself using that, yes.

- **Any benefits that you think are missing here?** <br>
Umm, let's see. No. No. No.
