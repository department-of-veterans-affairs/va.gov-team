## First Task: Benefits Questions - 10 minutes

- **Have you ever used any VA benefits or services?** <br>
I’ve used several benefits through the Army, and I know some of them are from the VA and some are not. It’s kind of mixed up, and I don’t get a thorough explanation of where they come from. I haven’t taken advantage of it yet, but I’ve applied for a home loan certificate. I know that’s through the VA. Is tuition assistance through VA at all?

  - **Federal tuition assistance?** <br>
  Yes.
  - **That's not through VA, that's DOD I think.** <br>
  Okay.
  - **Are you active duty? Army, right?** <br>
  Yes, I am.
  - **Active duty?** <br>
  Yes, sir.
  - **That's probably federal tuition assistance then, and not through VA. Any others that might come from VA?** <br>
  No, not offhand right now. To that extent, I basically only take advantage of tuition assistance, and I’ve gotten the mortgage VA certificate.
  - **Tell me about the last time you interacted with VA for the home loan certificate.** <br>
Well, I really didn’t to be honest. It was a third party financial advisor type person who kind of guided me through everything. It was a pretty easy process. There was an application form, we mailed it in, and then I believe it was a couple weeks later I got my certification in the mail. Pretty easy process. We haven’t used it yet. We’re still saving.

- **Are there any times in your life where you are planning to interact with VA in the future?** <br>
Well, I know that there are probably other benefits that I’m not aware of. If I was eligible for any, I’d like to take advantage. I’m sure when I get out of the Army, whenever that may be, that I’ll have a pretty good relationship with you guys.
  -	**But that’s not for a while now, right?** <br>
  Yeah, more than likely. 
  -	**Not something you’re planning right now?** <br>
  No. There are a couple little options we considered, but more than likely it won’t be for a while.
  -	**When you get to that part, how would you get information about VA benefits?** <br>
  Well, I will tell you this. To be honest with you, I have no idea. I would imagine, at least I would hope, that through the process of exiting the Army, there will be some sort of informative—hopefully a whole class, instruction block, on how you need to go about interacting with the VA. Right now, I’m completely clueless. So if there’s not an instruction block guiding me, I’ll be on my own on the Internet searching and calling people.
  -	**How would you search?** <br>
  I’d probably pull up the old reliable Google and type in whatever the scenario was—“Getting out of the Army, how do I use the VA,” something like that.

-	**Have you visited a VA website?** <br>
  Oh, actually, that just kind of jogged my memory a little bit. So the hazardous air quality registry, something along those lines, that is through you guys as well. I deployed in 2017 to Afghanistan and afterwards went onto VA’s website to become a member of that registry just to log in that I had been there. And just a couple weeks ago, I got a letter in the mail advising me to see a physician if I have any ongoing symptoms. And that I think is the only time I’ve used the website.
  - **Tell me more about that experience.** <br>
  Yeah, sure. So where I was deployed there, the air quality was horrendous. Probably upwards of 80% of personnel in the area had all sorts of respiratory problems, including myself.  Serious symptoms…and upon redeployment in the U.S., those symptoms didn’t go away. So our health care personnel advised us that there’s this registry…it doesn’t guarantee you’ll benefit in the future, but it’s being used for research and could be used later in life should you develop cancer or something else. So looking out for myself and my future, and hopefully to help other people, I went on and just logged my personal experience.
  - **Did you create an account for that?** <br>
  Yes, if I remember right.
  - **Do you remember which website it was?** <br>
  I cannot remember the exact title for the website. I remember “VA” was in there somewhere. Once again, I Googled it. I believe I Googled, “VA hazardous airborne registry,” and it popped up somewhere.
  
-	**If you were to go back and visit VA.gov again, what would you expect to see there?** <br>
  Yes, sure. So personally I wouldn’t necessarily, at this time in my life, I don’t have anything I’m actively looking for, or at least that I’m aware that I would find on the VA website. What I believe I would see is probably a reference to something like that airborne registry, something that references health care for past service members. I imagine that I would see pictures of past service members. Just that’s what I would imagine, something comparable to a hospital’s website, geared specifically to Veterans and prior service members.

## Second Task: Card Sort - 20 minutes

This is awfully interesting. I’m going to go ahead and just look at what I’ve got here, just read them all, all the different sections ***[reads through titles]***. Wow, okay, this is a doozy here. <br>

***[moves Voc Rehab over to create a category]*** Vocational rehabilitation and employment, okay, I see. <br>

***[places Career and Employment Assistance with Voc Rehab]*** Career and employment assistance *[pause]* if I need to change them once they’re in a group, will it allow me to do that?<br>

*[moderator answers, “Yes.”]*<br>

***[moves Health care into its own category]*** Wow, these are awfully close. So I’m kind of just trying to group them with their similarities, but I almost want to put them all in one group.<br>

***[moves Health Care over with Voc Rehab and Careers]*** So those kind of look like benefits.<br>

The Transition Assistance Program, is that basically like to find a job?<br>
*[moderator answers, “I’m going to refrain from answering that during the activity, but I’ll tell you afterwards.]*<br>
That’s fine. Maybe that’s more over here. ***[moves TAP over with Careers]***<br>

***[moves Records into its own category]*** Records is kind of going off on its own.<br>

***[moves Disability into its own category]*** Pre-discharge disability claim *[pause]* I don’t even know. This is something else.<br>

***[refers to the category of GI Bill, Home Loans, Pension]*** I feel like this one is pretty obviously labeled “Benefits.” <br>

***[refers to the category of TAP, Careers, Voc Rehab, and Health Care]*** This one maybe…they all kind of seem like they’re just transition. That’s how my mind kind of works here. They all kind of seem like they’d go under the same group title of “Transition,” with the exception of Burials and Records.<br>

***[moves GI Bill, Home Loan, and Pension in with TAP, Careers, Voc Rehab, and Health Care and labels this category “Transition Benefits/ Assistance”]*** They’re all kind of the same thing…like career and employment assistant, obviously you’re getting out of the military, you need employment. You might need vocational rehabilitation. You’re gonna need some health care post transition. 
The VA home loan could be kind of like pre-transition. GI Bill and other education, okay, so now that I’m thinking through it, I kind of like that idea.<br>

***[moves Home Loans and GI Bill into a new category and labels it “Pre-Transition”]*** This one is kind of like pre-transition.<br>

***[refers to the 3rd group of Records, Pre-discharge Disability Claim, Life Insurance, Burials]***  I don’t know even know what to…what’s a good word for paperwork stuff? Let’s go with “FAQs.” ***[labels this group “FAQs”]***<br>

<br>

***[finalizes groups and labels them as below]***<br>

<br>
-	**Transition Benefits/Assistance**
  - TAP
  - Career and Employment Assistance
  - Voc Rehab
  - Health Care
  - Veterans Pension
-	**Pre-Transition**
  -	Home Loans
  - GI Bill
- **FAQs*  
  - Records
  - Disability
  - Life Insurance
  - Burials
  
I feel like this is about 95% where I’d put them. <br>
Pension benefits is in Transition Benefits/Assistance because they really affect somebody post transition because that’s when you’re going to worry about it, but it’s really a pre-transition stipulation. <br>
Pre-transition is kind of…well, to get really far in the weeds, it would be like “Hey, you’re about to get out, here are some thoughts you need to have pre-transition.” <br>
I probably took your assignment here and went way off to the right.


### Follow-up Questions:

- **Which of these cards are the most important to you?** <br>
So I would base the importance off the impact it would have on someone’s everyday life, or on my life…. <br>
So I would think, and again they’re all so close, they’re really kind of blending into each other a bit here. But I would say the big ones are probably the career and employment assistance…well, I’ll probably have to give you top my top four and they’re blended together here for first place: health care post  separation, pension benefits, and then VA home loan, and then a really close second would be the education benefits. <br>
So that’s a really poor answer, but yeah, that’s how I would rank them.

- **Any that you were not aware of before today?** <br>
Yeah, I would say so I know…okay, so I did not know that you guys did anything with transition. I could probably imagine…employment assistance, not aware of that. Health care makes sense. Veterans pension, I would not imagine you guys would have anything to do with that. So I didn’t know the pension, the employment benefits, and the career assistance I was not aware of.
  -	**What about the ones in your FAQs section?** <br>
  Umm, yeah, yeah. I’m not like super informed on them, but yeah, I was aware that you guys play a part in them.

-	**Which of these do you see yourself using in the future?** <br>
Well, hopefully I won’t need to look into the burial part myself. Let’s see, I would , I mean I’m like a coupon collector kind of person, so I would take advantage of all of them that I would be eligible for. <br>
At this point in my life would be transition assistance, careers, health care, and possibly if I’m blessed with 20 years of service, then the pension. I did already have and plan to use the home loan. I’m going to in some ways take advantage of the GI Bill and education benefits. And then I imagine I will have some sort of disability claim. Life insurance yeah, I mean, post transition I’m going to need some sort of life insurance. And then the burial thing, hopefully I don’t have to play any significant part in looking into a burial. I would probably use all of them, with the exception of burials.

- **Are there any you feel are missing?** <br>
What do I feel is missing? Umm….*[pause]* that is hard to answer. Just because I wasn’t even aware of some of these. Umm…*[pause]* let’s see, so missing as in what do I think the VA could do for Veterans that they don’t have listed here?
  -	**What info would you expect to find?**<br>
  Yeah, I’m thinking, that’s a really hard…I mean, it seems like a pretty thorough list here. You kind of hit all the different benefits of all the primary concerns people would have in their life. They’re all here. You’ve got the health care after separation. <br>
I imagine that it’s somewhere, but on this list here is nothing that’s like what to expect with your health care process. But I imagine that’s probably under health care separation somewhere. <br>
So…*[pause]* I would say, if I had to say something that’s missing, it’s not really in the listing of items. It’s more in the way that they’re listed. They all seem, they’re not very—they’re very black and white and they’re just not— I don’t know. I would expect there to be something that’s more like a use friendly welcoming type of aspect here. That’s not here, but I don’t know. I’m kind of….
