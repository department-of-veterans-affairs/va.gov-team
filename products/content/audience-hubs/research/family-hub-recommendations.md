# Family Hub Tree Test Follow-up
## 3 main results
- Family members mostly went to the main Hubs for the benefits, but some still went to the Family Member Hub
- The Spouses and Dependents  / Survivors spokes did not create a meaningful distinction
- Family members were seeking the "manage" tasks in the Family Member Hub, although they were not there.
## What we learned
- Validated keeping the main benefit hubs as the main source of truth for all user types
- There is use in the Family Hub, since about 15% used it as their starting point for the tasks
## Recommendations
- We need to update the Family Member Persona hub to include both the benefits specifically for the family member and the benefits that a family member might do on behalf of a Veteran.  Example spokes.
- Get Benefits for Yourself
- Help Veterans Mange their Benefits
- Note: Roll the caregiver benefit into the bottom of the Get Benefits for Yourself
The Hub should be called "(For) Family Members and Caregivers"
