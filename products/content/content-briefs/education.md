## Overview

Speaking plainly, compassionately, and consistently across VA.gov helps us build trust with Veterans, service members, and their family members. As we continue to move toward an omnichannel experience and multilingual content, consistency becomes even more important.  

This brief will help your team create content for your product that aligns with the VA.gov voice and content standards and that uses consistent language about VA education benefits. It’ll also help us all track content decisions so we can all stay aligned from discovery through post-launch iterations. This is a living document.

## Related terminology

| Word or phrase | How we use this term | Notes | Where to find related language we use to define or describe this term in Veteran communications | Official content style guide status | Date term added/last updated |
| -------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Approved program at a school (not “approved school”) | The schools themselves aren't approved, only some programs at schools. It isn’t accurate to say that a school is approved. | | | We’ll add this to the style guide.
| Chapter numbers (like Chapter 33 or Chapter 35) | When referencing an education benefit (like Post-9/11 GI Bill or DEA), include the chapter information on first mention only. Use either parentheses or a separate sentence.</br><br> | For DEA benefits specifically, search data shows that people often search for Chapter 35 rather than DEA or the spelled-out name. So we use Chapter 35 in text more often than the other chapter numbers. | [Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33)](https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/post-9-11/)</br><br>**Example found in introduction paragraph:** The Post-9/11 GI Bill (PGIB), or Chapter 33, helps you pay for school or cover expenses while you’re training for a job. | We’ll add this to the style guide.
| Cover the costs/cover expenses | We use this term when we’re explaining that education benefits pay for more than tuition and fees. | You can use education benefits for getting paid back for national tests or licensing and certification tests—or more broadly paying for other expenses you may have while you’re training for a job if you’re in the co-op training program. | [About GI Bill benefits](https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/)</br><br>**Example:** GI Bill benefits help you pay for school and cover expenses while you’re training for a job. | We’ll add this to the style guide. | 
| Dependent child | We don’t use “dependent spouse.”</br><br>Use this construction if you’re referring to both spouse and child: “spouse and dependent child” (not “dependent spouse and child”). | | | We’ll add this to the style guide.
| Dependents’ Educational Assistance (DEA) | “Dependents” is plural so the apostrophe goes on the right side of the “s.” | This VA education benefit used to be called Survivors’ and Dependents’ Educational Assistance (DEA). Now the name no longer includes “Survivors.” | | We’ll update this entry in the style guide.
| Education benefit | Use “education benefit” rather than “education program.” This helps avoid confusion with “school programs.” | We use “program” sometimes when talking about the name of an education benefit, like the Yellow Ribbon Program. But we’d then in subsequent/surrounding content say, “this education benefit.” | | We’ll add this to the style guide. |
| Eligible | We use both “qualify” and “eligible” when referring to education benefits. | | | We’ll add this to the style guide.
| Entitlement | This term refers to how much of a benefit you have available to use. It’s measured in months and days. It’s often talked about as “remaining entitlement.” We don’t say “draw down your entitlement.” Instead, we’d say, “charge your entitlement.” | | [National tests](https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/how-to-use-benefits/national-tests/)</br><br>**Example:** Check the rates page for the benefit you’re using to find out how we’ll charge your entitlement. | We’ll add this to the style guide.
| Get paid back | We try to use this plain language phrase instead of “get reimbursed” but we do have some instances of “reimbursed.” | | | We’ll add this to the style guide.
| National tests | We use “national tests” rather than “national exams” because we know from SEO data that Veterans are searching for “tests” much more often than “exams.” | VA.gov content differs from the PDF form that uses “national exams.” We need to revisit this discrepancy at some point for consistency. | [National tests](https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/how-to-use-benefits/national-tests/) | We’ll add this to the style guide. | 
| Non-qualifying period of service | We use this term (and variations of it) to explain when a Veteran’s period of service doesn’t count toward their GI Bill eligibility requirements. |  | [Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33)](https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/post-9-11/)</br><br>**Example in this section:** “Does VA consider some periods of service to be “non-qualifying”?” | We’ll add this to the style guide.
| Post-9/11 GI Bill (PGIB)</br><br>Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB)</br><br>Montgomery GI Bill Active Duty (MGIB-AD)</br><br>Montgomery GI Bill Selected Reserve (MGIB-SR) | We usually advise that we can use an initialism by itself after the first mention of the full name. But we should balance that guidance with how often this initialism is used on a single page to be sure it’s not overused. Try to find a balance between using the full name and the initialism. | PGIB is a newer initialism (as of 2024). We haven’t applied it to all existing pages yet.</br><br>We shouldn’t use a shortened “Montgomery GI Bill” to indicate both Active Duty and Selected Reserve. Instead write out the full name of both benefits. | [Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33)](https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/post-9-11/)</br><br>**Example found in introduction paragraph:** The Post-9/11 GI Bill (PGIB), or Chapter 33, helps you pay for school or cover expenses while you’re training for a job. | We’ll add PGIB to the style guide and update entries for MGIB-AD and MGIB-SR.
| Preparatory courses or “prep courses” | Preparatory courses help you prepare for licensing and certification tests. | Use “preparatory courses” on the first mention. The shorter "prep courses" is OK for any following mentions. | [In this prep course Q&A](https://prod.cms.va.gov/resources/can-i-use-my-va-education-benefits-to-pay-for-preparatory-courses) | We’ll add this to the style guide. |  |
| Qualify | We use both “qualify” and “eligible” when referring to education benefits. | | | We’ll add this to the style guide.
| Relinquish your benefits | Plain language definition: give up your right to use your benefits | | **Example in the info alert:** Even if you gave up your right to use MGIB-AD benefits in the past (we call this “relinquishing” your benefits), you may now qualify to use some of that entitlement.<br><br>This is not evergreen content as it’s connected to the Rudisill Supreme Court decision. | We’ll add this to the style guide. | 
| Spouse | We use “surviving spouse” if the Veteran has died. We use “spouse” if the Veteran is living (we don’t use “dependent spouse”).</br><br>Use this construction if you’re referring to both spouse and child: “spouse and dependent child” (not “dependent spouse and child”) | | | We’ll add this to the style guide.
| VET TEC 2.0 | This is a 2-year pilot program that eligible Veterans and active-duty service members will be able to start applying for in 2026. If a Veteran or service member wants to develop their skills to start or advance a career in a high-tech industry, this program will match them with a leading training provider. | | | We’ll add this to the style guide.

## Content-specific research findings

Here’s where we add content-related notes that came out of research that should inform the messaging generally and word choice specifically. We want to make sure that the terms we use and the explanations we provide are clear to Veterans. We don’t make major messaging or labeling changes based on any one study, but rather watch for trends over time.
