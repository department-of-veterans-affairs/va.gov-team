# VA.gov content brief for Notice of Disagreement (NOD)

**Created by the VA.gov sitewide content team for the Claims and Appeals team, 3/2021.**

**Questions about this brief?**
- Ask us in our slack channel: #va-sitewide-content
- Read about the [purpose of a content brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/sitewide-content/content-brief-purpose.md)

## Overview

Speaking plainly, compassionately, and consistently across VA.gov helps us build trust with Veterans, service members, and their family members. This brief will help your team create content for your product that aligns with the VA.gov voice and content standards. It will also help us all track content decisions so we can all stay aligned from discovery through post-launch iterations. This is a living document. We’ll work with your team to update it as we go.

## Established content standards for this product/benefit area
-	The 3 decision review options are title capped: Supplemental Claim, Higher-Level Review, or Board Appeal
-	Types of claims are lowercased, like initial claim and new claim
-	Notice of Disagreement is title capped.
-	Use “Decision Notice” rather than “Decision Letter”
-	When shortening the “Board of Appeals” to “the Board,” cap the B
-	We don't talk about it in terms of "eligibility" to request a Board Appeal; instead follow the language on the static Board Appeals page: https://www.va.gov/decision-reviews/board-appeal/, which is "Can I request a Board Appeal.

## The 5 basics 

Follow these content style best practices:
- **Use contractions** to achieve a conversational voice and tone (this helps avoid formal-sounding language). 
- **Keep it brief**
  - < 52 characters for H1s
  - < 70 characters for H2s
  - < 35 characters for buttons
  - < 20 to 25 words for sentences
- **Provide information using our Q&A formula**—as though you’re having a conversation with the Veteran on behalf of VA. The Veteran asks us questions in their voice, and we answer in ours. <br> **Example:** <br> How do I apply for VA health care? You can apply online now. If you need help, call us.
- **Add a plain language definition if you need to use a complex term.** The complex terms can come first or you can lead with the plain language description. <br> **Examples:** <br> You'll find your payroll deductions in a recent paycheck. Deductions include money withheld from your pay for things like taxes and benefits.
- **Use bold text in meaningful ways.** Don't overuse it or it'll lose its impact. See the [full style guide entry for how to use bold text effectively](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/bold-text).

Add content-related notes that came out of research that should inform the messaging generally and word choice specifically.

## Notes from stakeholders

**INITIAL FEEDBACK FROM 3/2021**

**1/ Informational (static) page**
Stakeholders: They wanted to look at the opt-in language in the blue box. Rewrite it. Possibly not include it here at all.
Beth's direction: Since opt-in is addressed in the form itself, that may be enough. We'd want to confirm all this with the stakeholders, but my recommendation is that we remove it. 
Alternately, if there's a conversation about this with them to explore other options, it could be a Q&A down lower on the page. "Do I need to opt in to the new process?"

**2/ 1 of 4 on the form: Please provide your representative's contact information**
Stakeholders: Change the field label "Representative's name" since VA wants to know the name of an organization rather than an individual. 
Also, since this is a box that the user needs to type into rather than a drop down, "they can put anything in there." And it might not be someone approved by the Board. 
The problem is that we don't want them typing in an individual's name rather than a VSO (organization) name. The question is, can we pull the info for them, so they just select.

**3/ 1 of 4: Where the boxes are listing each condition/issue** 
Stakeholders: The Veteran will need a way to indicate which benefit they're seeking--is it an increased rating? Or an earlier effective date? Both?

**4/ 1 of 4: "Add issue" button**
Stakeholders: How can we make sure the user is clear that when they use this feature, they're adding an issue they don't see there that they already have received a decision on. 
They need to know that they can't just add an issue they'd like to see there.

**5/ 1 of 4: “We encourage you to work with your representative to decide which of the following options is best for you.”**
Stakeholders: It probably doesn't make sense to keep this on the screen where the user selects a board review option, because they're already in progress with the form.

**Content-specific feedback from call with Robin/Kevin and stakholders on 4/16/21**

- Asking for representative’s name - preference on this screen is to let user know they can specify an org as opposed to a specific name.
- What is being appealed (area of disagreement)? Add functionality to make or enter selection, preferably a checkbox of handful of known options. 

**Notes from an email on 4/20/21**

This will inform content revisions around whether to include opt-in messaging and how to frame it:
- It's a legal requirement to opt in to the new appeals process if the Veteran has a legacy appeal and wants to switch to AMA. That's the only way to get a review under the new decision review process.
- Opting in should generally mean a faster review and decision than the Veteran would get in the legacy system. 
- We need to have reference to opting in on the form.

## Other notes

- Sitewide content is starting to set some new standards for intro pages and labels. We’ll be adding a first step to the subway map of the intro page: Check eligibility. But in this case, as I noted above in "Established content standards," we don't talk about it in terms of being eligible. So for No. 1 in the subway map, we're going with: ~Make sure you can request a Board Appeal~ Check to be sure you can request a Board Appeal.
- Here are the 3 subway map headers: Check to be sure you can request a Board Appeal / Gather your information / Start your request
- I reworked other parts of the intro page according to new style standards. They include bringing eligibility into the subway map and removing the last 2 steps that aren't steps the Veteran takes. The info from those is about what happens after you apply. We're trying out an additional info element within the third subway step that will unfurl to provide the info about what happens after you apply.
- New style for H1 is: Plain language CTA | New style for subhead is: Official form name (VA Form ####)
