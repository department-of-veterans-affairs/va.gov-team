## Overview

Speaking plainly, compassionately, and consistently across VA helps us build trust with Veterans, service members, and their family members. As we continue to move toward an omnichannel experience and multilingual content, consistency becomes even more important.  

This brief will help your team create content for your product that aligns with the VA.gov voice and content standards and that uses consistent language about VA payments, debts, and copay bills. It will also help us all track content decisions so we can all stay aligned from discovery through post-launch iterations. This is a living document.

## Content-specific research findings

Here's where we add content-related notes that came out of research that should inform the messaging generally and word choice specifically. We want to make sure that the terms we use and the explanations we provide are clear to Veterans. We don't make major messaging or labeling changes based on any 1 study, but rather watch for trends over time.
