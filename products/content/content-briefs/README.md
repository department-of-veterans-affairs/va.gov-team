# Content briefs

## What’s a content brief?

A content brief is a shared resource designed to help teams working across different products and channels create consistent content about a certain topic area. This consistency builds trust with our Veterans, their dependents, and their caregivers.

A content brief can also help VA teams consolidate nuanced, content-specific research findings. This helps us identify common areas of concern for further research and opportunities for new or improved content.

## What’s in a content brief?

A content brief captures this information about a specific topic area:
- **Related terminology:** Specific words and phrases that we use to explain a topic area
- **Content considerations:** 
- **Content-specific research findings:**
- **Content pages related to the topic area:**
- **Other notes:**

We base the guidance in each content brief on these sources:

- Search engine optimization (SEO) research
- Veteran research findings and ongoing feedback
- The VA.gov style guide
- VA subject matter expert guidance

## Who creates a content brief for a new topic area?

The sitewide content and IA team creates and manages each content brief.

Briefs are living documents made for shared collaboration. We encourage researchers to add their latest content-specific research findings. We encourage subject matter experts to add notes for consideration. We encourage all team members across VA to reach out to the sitewide content and IA team any time with questions or suggestions for content briefs.
