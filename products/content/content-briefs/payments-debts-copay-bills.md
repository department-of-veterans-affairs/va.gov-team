## Overview

Speaking plainly, compassionately, and consistently across VA helps us build trust with Veterans, service members, and their family members. As we continue to move toward an omnichannel experience and multilingual content, consistency becomes even more important.  

This brief will help your team create content for your product that aligns with the VA.gov voice and content standards and that uses consistent language about VA payments, debts, and copay bills. It will also help us all track content decisions so we can all stay aligned from discovery through post-launch iterations. This is a living document.

## Related terminology

| Word or phrase | How we use this term | Notes | Where to find related language we use to define or describe this term in Veteran communications | Official content style guide status | Date term added/last updated |
| -------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| **benefit overpayment / overpayment** | We use this term to describe when VA pays a Veteran too much money related to a VA benefit (such as disability, education, or pension benefits) and the Veteran now owes that money back to VA. | Use "benefit overpayment" on first mention and "overpayment" for all subsequent mentions. In spaces with limited character counts, just "overpayments" is okay in all instances. | [VA debt management](https://www.va.gov/resources/va-debt-management/) (Q&A on "Why do I owe VA money?") | Not yet in style guide | 9.30.22 |
| **balance (used with "debt balance" and "copay bill balance")** | We use this term to describe the remaining amount a Veteran owes on a debt or copay bill. | We use this mainly within the online debt portal itself. |[VA debt management](https://www.va.gov/resources/va-debt-management/) (Q&A on "How do I check my VA debt balance to find out how much I owe?") | Not yet in content style guide | 9.30.22 | 
| **benefit debt** | At this time, we use this term to describe a debt related to VA benefits and to distinguish it from copay-related debt. |  Note that we need to revisit the use of "benefit debt" vs. "overpayment." We started with "benefit debt," but have since confirmed that we can confidently refer to all benefit-related debts as "overpayments" and this is a less negative term. **Note:** Met with our DMC partner and confirmed that we can retire the "benefit debt" term in favor of "overpayment." | [Manage your VA debt](https://www.va.gov/manage-va-debt/) | Not yet in content style guide | 11.10.22 |
| **compromise offer** | We use this term to describe this specific debt repayment/relief option. | Compromise offers are an option for both overpayment and copay-related debt. | [VA debt management resources and support page](https://www.va.gov/resources/va-debt-management/) (Q&A on "What debt repayment and relief options does VA offer?") | Not yet in content style guide | 9.30.22 | 
| **copay / copayment / health care copay** | We use this term to describe the amount some Veterans pay for certain health care services and prescriptions. | We don't yet have a firm rule on when to use which version ("copay/copayment/health care copay"). But we typically use "health care copay" on a first mention in general content where the context of health care is necessary and then "copay" on subsequent mentions. | | Not yet in content style guide  | 9.12.22 | 
| **copay bill / patient statement / billing statement** | We use these terms to describe the bill/statement that a Veteran receives for their health care copay.| This is a term that we need to refine more. Content will work with VHA partner to refine guidance and document here. | | Not yet in content style guide | 9.12.22 |
| **debt** | This is the overarching term we use for any money the Veteran owes to VA. "Debt" encompasses money owed for overpayments as well as copays. |  |  | Not yet in content style guide | 9.12.22 |
| **debt relief** | We use this term to describe help that VA offers Veterans for their debt (such as a waiver, compromise offer, or write off). |  |  | Not yet in content style guide | 9.12.22 |
| **monthly offset** | This is 1 of 4 repayment or relief options for paying down a VA debt related to benefit overpayments. | Here's how we describe monthly offsets: If you get VA benefit payments, we may keep (or “offset”) part or all of each payment to pay down your debt. This is how we'll collect your debt unless we approve another option.  |  | Not yet in content style guide | 9.12.22 |
| **outstanding debt** | We use this term to describe a debt that the Veteran currently owes to VA. We currently use this terminology for headers within MyVA and the VA mobile app. |  |  | Not yet in content style guide | 9.12.22 |
| **overpayment debt** | We use this term to refer to a debt that's because of an overpayment. For example, in MyVA, we use this term to display the number of current overpayment debts a Veteran has to differentiate overpayment debt from copay debt. **Note:** Met with our DMC partner and confirmed that we can just go with "overpayments" (and not add "overpayment debts") in the MyVA instance. | | | Not yet in content style guide | 11.10.22 |
| **payment / payments / VA payment** | These terms are highly contextual. We typically use **VA payment** to describe a payment that VA makes to the Veteran. However, we do use **payment** (without the **VA**) in the context of **payment history** to describe the display of a historical record of payments VA has made to the Veteran. We also use the plural version of this term (**Payments**) as the top-level category to house debts and payment history in the VA mobile app. The term has tested well in past IA research and we'll continue to test it as a category header moving forward. We also use **payment** in the context of a payment a Veteran can make to pay down a debt. | | | Not yet in content style guide | 9.12.22 |
| **payment history** | We use for displaying a history of payments VA has made to a Veteran. | | | Not yet in content style guide | 9.12.22 |
| **pay vs. repay** | We use **pay** to describe paying a copay bill. We use **repay** to describe repaying an overpayment from VA. We use **make a payment** in both contexts. |  |  | Not yet in content style guide | 9.12.22 |
| **pay down a debt** | We use this phrase to describe how a Veteran makes payments toward paying down a debt over time. |  |  | Not yet in content style guide | 9.13.22 |
| **repayment plan** / **monthly payment plan** (also **extended monthly payment plan**) | This is 1 of 4 repayment or relief options for paying down a VA debt related to benefit overpayments. A repayment plan is also an option for copays. | Here's how we describe a repayment plan: "If you can’t pay your full debt balance now, you can ask to make smaller monthly payments." <br> Note that an **extended monthly payment plan** refers to a plan to pay down the debt in 5 or more years. As part of COVId-19 relief, Veterans can request plans of less than 5 years online, by phone, or by mail and don't need to submit an FSR. They must fill out an FSR for extended plans of 5 years or more. |  | Not yet in content style guide | 9.12.22 |
| **waiver** | This is 1 of 4 repayment or relief options for VA debt. A waiver is also a debt relief option for copay debt. | | | Not yet in content style guide | 9.12.22 |

## Content considerations specific to payments and debts

### Communicating the importance of timely action

Veterans can avoid issues such as late fees and collection action by either paying their debt balance or requesting help within 30 days. We always aim to communicate this to make clear the importance of taking timely action.

### Communicating that help is always available

Debt is a topic that causes anxiety for many people. So whenever we write about debt, we always aim to include the message that we are here to help Veterans manage their debt through repayment plans or debt relief options.

## Content-specific research findings

Here's where we add content-related notes that came out of research that should inform the messaging generally and word choice specifically. We want to make sure that the terms we use and the explanations we provide are clear to Veterans. We don't make major messaging or labeling changes based on any 1 study, but rather watch for trends over time.

### 2022-09 VA mobile app IA & navigation research

- Tested Veterans' expectations around a "payments" category
  - Participants expected to find 2 main things in Payments (but not always both):
    - A record of payments from VA (12/13 participants). The most frequently mentioned type of payment was related to disability (9/13).
    - A record of money owed to VA (8/13 participants). The most frequently mentioned type of money owed was a copay of some kind (6/13).
- Tested Veterans' expectations around the term "outstanding debts"
  - When asked what they expected to find in "outstanding debts," 12/13 participants expected that they would find money they owed to VA. The most frequently mentioned type of money owed were copays (5/13) and overpayment (4/13). Also mentioned were loans and VA health locations.
  - P21: "I would be looking for my Pharmacy copayments—even though it's not considered a collectible debt, it's still a debt, also if I had been overpaid, or if for some reason I'm owing the VA money for something."
  - 1 participant was unaware that debts to the VA were possible:
P10 “Wow. I am thinking… how someone could owe the VA money?”

**Note:** Will add link to full study in research repo when posted.

### 2022-07 Benefit payments and debts usability study
  - Tested separate section for debts vs benefit payments - all understood debt is something they owe and payments were something they are receiving
    - "I would assume 'outstanding debts' would include the co-payment. I guess it would show a breakdown of the debts. ʻBenefit paymentʼ would include my payment history and education benefits.”
o	“ʻOutstanding debtsʼ is what you need to pay the VA. Maybe its things that you need to pay or didn't do. ʻBenefit paymentsʼ I would assume is your monthly benefit payment, education, or anything else you can get from the VA.”
  - Tested copays and debt combined into 1 total, and a version where they were separate - 100% preferred separated amounts
    - “Debts and copays donʼt come out of the same budget for me. I want to see them here separately.” - P8
  - Feedback on "benefit payments" as separate section 
    - 100% were able to define that this was for money being paid to them.
  - Having debt to VA can worsen mental health for veterans. Discussing this with some participants brought up strong feelings of anxiety.

### 2022-06 Combined debt portal research

#### How participants defined copays, debt, and bills:
 - **Copay:**	Participants defined copays in relation to money owed for medical related expenses.
   - “A copay is when you’re paying whatever insurance doesn’t cover for service that you had.”
- **Debt:**	Participants defined debt as money owed, usually through overpayment from VA.
  - “Bill is something that is due now. Debt is money you owe, debt is something you owe from the past.”
  - “Debt is an overpayment that I owe them back.”
- **Bill:**	Most participants defined bills as similar to debt, as money owed and many viewed it as a statement for money owed
  - “Bills being a request for me to pay my liable for my debt to the VA.”
