[Read about the purpose of a content brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/sitewide-content/content-brief-purpose.md) <br>

## Overview
Speaking plainly, compassionately, and consistently across VA.gov helps us build trust with Veterans, service members, and their family members. This brief will help your team create content for your product that aligns with the VA.gov voice and content standards. It will also help us all track content decisions so we can all stay aligned from discovery through post-launch iterations. This is a living document. We’ll work with your team to update it as we go.

## Established content standards for this product/benefit area
- VA health care (health care is 2 words; no need for "benefits" or "program" after)
- Appointment vs. visit: As we move toward preparing for translation, we want to be as consistent as possible with content terms. Use "appointment" throughout.

## The 5 basics
Follow these content style best practices:

- **Use contractions** to achieve a conversational voice and tone (this helps avoid formal-sounding language).
- **Keep it brief**
  - < 52 characters for H1s
  - < 70 characters for H2s
  - < 35 characters for buttons
  - < 20 to 25 words for sentences
- **Provide information using our Q&A formula where appropriate**—as though you’re having a conversation with the Veteran on behalf of VA. The Veteran asks us questions in their voice, and we answer in ours. <br>
**Example:** <br>
How do I apply for VA health care? You can apply online now. If you need help, call us.
- *Add a plain language definition if you need to use a complex term.** The complex terms can come first or you can lead with the plain language description. <br>
**Example:**
You'll find your payroll deductions in a recent paycheck. Deductions include money withheld from your pay for things like taxes and benefits.
- **Use bold text in meaningful ways.** Don't overuse it or it'll lose its impact. Go to the [full style guide entry for how to use bold text effectively](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/bold-text)
