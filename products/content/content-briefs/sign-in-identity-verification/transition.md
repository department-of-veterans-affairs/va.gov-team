### If and when MHV goes away as a sign in option: Make it clear that My HealtheVet is not going awayâ€”only the My HealtheVet account is ###

If and when MHV goes away as a sign in option, when we communicate about VA no longer offering an MHV account option, we need to be careful not to imply that My HealtheVet is going away. The MHV on VA.gov communication strategy stresses that My HealtheVet is **not** going away. It's getting a new home on VA.gov.
