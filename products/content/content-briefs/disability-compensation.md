## Overview

## Related terminology

- **File a claim:** Always use the phrase "file a claim" rather than "apply" when referring to disability compensation. 

- **Disability benefits vs. disability compensation:** We want to finalize whether we always say "compensation."

- **Service-connected condition:** We define this as "an illness or injury that was caused by—or got worse because of—your active military service."
- **Disability vs condition:** A "condition" is an illness or injury that affects your mind or body. We call your condition a "disability" after you've received a disability rating. </br>
**Uses:**</br>
**When describing the Veteran's conditions that don't yet have a disability rating:** Use condition or service-connected condition, depending on context. Example: If you believe your condition is connected to your service."</br>
**When describing conditions that VA connects to a Veteran's service in general,** use "condition" (and "service-connected condition" or "presumptive condition" as appropriate in context).</br>
 **When describing rated disabilities,** use "service-connected disability" on first mention on a page and "disability" on subsequent mentions.

- **Illness, injury, condition:** If describing only illnesses or injuries alone, use just "illness" or "injury." If describing illnesses or injuries, use "illness or injury (also called "condition")" and then "condition" for subsequent mentions. 

- **VA disability rating:** We say "VA disability rating" on first mention, then drop the "VA" for subsequent mentions. We don't need to say "service-connected disability rating" by default.

- **Inservice disability claim:** You got sick or injured while serving in the military—and can link this condition to your illness or injury.

- **Preservice disability claim:** You had an illness or injury before you joined the military—and serving made it worse.

- **Postservice disability claim:** You have a disability related to your active-duty service that didn’t appear until after you ended your service.

- **Loss of range of motion**: Problems moving your body

- **VA disability compensation:** VA disability compensation provides tax-free monthly payments.

- **Retroactive payments:**
  
- **Disabling:** A condition is 10% disabling / 20% disabling, etc.
  
- **Posttraumatic:** No hyphen when spelling out PTSD.
  
- **180-90 days left on active duty:** We start with the higher number (180) because this is a countdown to the discharge date. SMEs don't want us to show it as 90-180 days.
