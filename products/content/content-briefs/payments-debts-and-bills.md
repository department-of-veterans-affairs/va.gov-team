## Overview

Speaking plainly, compassionately, and consistently across VA helps us build trust with Veterans, service members, and their family members. As we continue to move toward an omnichannel experience and multilingual content, consistency becomes even more important.  

This brief will help your team create content for your product that aligns with the VA.gov voice and content standards and that uses consistent language about VA payments, debts, and copay bills. It will also help us all track content decisions so we can all stay aligned from discovery through post-launch iterations. This is a living document.

## Related terminology

| Word or phrase | How we use this term | Notes | Where to find related language we use to define or describe this term in Veteran communications | Official content style guide status | Date term added/last updated |
| -------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| **benefit overpayment / overpayment** | We use this term to describe when VA pays a Veteran too much money related to a VA benefit (such as disability, education, or pension benefits). | Use "benefit overpayment" on first mention and "overpayment" for all subsequent mentions. In spaces with limited character counts, just "overpayments" is okay. | [VA debt management resources and support page](https://www.va.gov/resources/va-debt-management/) (Q&A on "Why do I owe VA money?") | | 9.12.22 |
| **balance (used with "debt balance" and "copay bill balance")** | We use this term to describe the remaining amount a Veteran owes on a debt or copay bill. | We use this mainly within the online debt portal itself. | | | 9.12.22 | 
| **benefit debt** | At this time, we use this term to describe a debt related to VA benefits and to distinguish it from copay-related debt. |  Note that we need to revisit the use of "benefit debt" rather than "overpayment debt." We want to do this because we've confirmed that all benefit-related debts are related to  | 
| **compromise offer** | We use this term to describe this specific debt repayment/relief option. | Compromise offers are an option for both overpayment and copay-related debt. | [VA debt management resources and support page](https://www.va.gov/resources/va-debt-management/) (Q&A on "What debt repayment and relief options does VA offer?") | | 9.12.22 | 
| **copay / copayment / health care copay** | This is the term we use for the Veteran's health care copay. | We don't yet have a firm rule on when to use which version ("copay/copayment/health care copay"). But we typically use "health care copay" on a first mention and then "copay." Will work to solidify this. |  | 9.12.22 | 
| **copay bill / patient statement / billing statement** | We use these terms to describe the bill (or statement) that a Veteran receives for their health care copay. This is a term that we need to refine more. | | Sitewide content and IA team  | 9.12.22 |
| debt | This is the overarching term we use for any money the Veteran owes to VA. "Debt" encompasses money owed for overpayments as well as copays.  | Sitewide content and IA team  | 9.12.22 |
| **monthly offset** | This is 1 of 4 repayment or relief options for paying down a VA debt related to benefit overpayments. Here's how we describe monthly offsets: If you get VA benefit payments, we may keep (or “offset”) part or all of each payment to pay down your debt. This is how we'll collect your debt unless we approve another option. | Sitewide content and IA team | 9.12.22 |
| **outstanding debt** | We use this This is the term we use to describe a debt that the Veteran currently owes to VA. We currently use this terminology for headers within MyVA and the VA mobile app. | Sitewide content and IA team  | 9.12.22 |
| **overpayment debt** | We use this term to refer to a debt that's because of an overpayment. For example, in MyVA, we use this term to display the number of current overpayment debts a Veteran has to differentiate overpayment debt from copay debt. |  |  | Sitewide content and IA team  | 9.12.22 |
| **payment / payments / VA payment** | These terms are highly contextual. We typically use **VA payment** to describe a payment that VA makes to the Veteran. However, we do use **payment** (without the **VA**) in the context of **payment history** to describe the display of a historical record of payments VA has made to the Veteran. We also use the plural version of this term (**Payments**) as the top-level category to house debts and payment history in the VA mobile app. The term has tested well in past IA research and we'll continue to test it as a category header moving forward. We also use **payment** in the context of a payment a Veteran can make to pay down a debt. | Sitewide content and IA team  | 9.12.22 |
| **payment history** | This is the term we use for displaying a history of payments VA has made to a Veteran. | Sitewide content and IA team | 9.12.22 |
| **pay vs. repay** | We use **pay** to describe paying a copay bill. We use **repay** to describe repaying an overpayment from VA. We use **make a payment** in both contexts. | Sitewide content and IA team | 9.12.22 |
| **pay down a debt** | We use this phrase to describe how a Veteran makes payments toward paying down a debt over time. | Sitewide content and IA team | 9.13.22 |
| **repayment plan** | This is 1 of 4 repayment or relief options for paying down a VA debt related to benefit overpayments. Here's how we describe a repayment plan:  If you can’t pay your full debt balance now, you can ask to make smaller monthly payments. | Sitewide content and IA team | 9.12.22 |
| **waiver** | This is 1 of 4 repayment or relief options for VA debt. | Sitewide content and IA team | 9.12.22 |

## Research findings

Add content-related notes that came out of research that should inform the messaging generally and word choice specifically.

### 2022-07 Benefit payments and debts usability study
  - Tested separate section for debts vs benefit payments - all understood debt is something they owe and payments were something they are receiving
    - "I would assume 'outstanding debts' would include the co-payment. I guess it would show a breakdown of the debts. ʻBenefit paymentʼ would include my payment history and education benefits.”
o	“ʻOutstanding debtsʼ is what you need to pay the VA. Maybe its things that you need to pay or didn't do. ʻBenefit paymentsʼ I would assume is your monthly benefit payment, education, or anything else you can get from the VA.”
  - Tested copays and debt combined into 1 total, and a version where they were separate - 100% preferred separated amounts
    - “Debts and copays donʼt come out of the same budget for me. I want to see them here separately.” - P8
  - Feedback on "benefit payments" as separate section 
    - 100% were able to define that this was for money being paid to them
  - Having debt to VA can worsen mental health for veterans. Discussing this with some participants brought up strong feelings of anxiety

### Combined debt portal research, 2022-06

#### How participants defined copays, debt, and bills:
 - **Copay:**	Participants defined copays in relation to money owed for medical related expenses.
   - “A copay is when you’re paying whatever insurance doesn’t cover for service that you had.”
- **Debt:**	Participants defined debt as money owed, usually through overpayment from VA.
  - “Bill is something that is due now. Debt is money you owe, debt is something you owe from the past.”
  - “Debt is an overpayment that I owe them back.”
- **Bill:**	Most participants defined bills as similar to debt, as money owed and many viewed it as a statement for money owed
  - “Bills being a request for me to pay my liable for my debt to the VA.”
