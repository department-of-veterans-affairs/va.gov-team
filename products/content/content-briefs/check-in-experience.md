[Read about the purpose of a content brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/sitewide-content/content-brief-purpose.md) <br>

## Overview
Speaking plainly, compassionately, and consistently across VA.gov helps us build trust with Veterans, service members, and their family members. This brief will help your team create content for your product that aligns with the VA.gov voice and content standards. It will also help us all track content decisions so we can all stay aligned from discovery through post-launch iterations. This is a living document. We’ll work with your team to update it as we go.

## Established content standards for this product/benefit area
- VA health care (health care is 2 words; no need for "benefits" or "program" after)
- Appointment vs. visit: As we move toward preparing for translation, we want to be as consistent as possible with content terms. Use "appointment" throughout.

## The 5 basics
Follow these content style best practices:

- **Use contractions** to achieve a conversational voice and tone (this helps avoid formal-sounding language).
- **Keep it brief**
  - < 52 characters for H1s
  - < 70 characters for H2s
  - < 35 characters for buttons
  - < 20 to 25 words for sentences
- **Provide information using our Q&A formula where appropriate**—as though you’re having a conversation with the Veteran on behalf of VA. The Veteran asks us questions in their voice, and we answer in ours. <br>
**Example:** <br>
How do I apply for VA health care? You can apply online now. If you need help, call us.
- *Add a plain language definition if you need to use a complex term.** The complex terms can come first or you can lead with the plain language description. <br>
**Example:**
You'll find your payroll deductions in a recent paycheck. Deductions include money withheld from your pay for things like taxes and benefits.
- **Use bold text in meaningful ways.** Don't overuse it or it'll lose its impact. Go to the [full style guide entry for how to use bold text effectively](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/bold-text)

## Research findings
Add content-related notes that came out of research that should inform the messaging generally and word choice specifically.

## Other notes

#### 6.4.21 office hours

- Tasks, steps, etc: "Tasks" feels like we're giving work. "Steps" is good, but you don't have to do these things in order to may not quite work. Danielle to think on this more and make recommendation.
- Privacy: We don't currently have privacy information in the profile. So do we need it in the contact information screen here that has the same info? Likely no, but Danielle will discuss with Patrick. If we do need it, recommend simply a note rather than a prominent Q&A. We already have the privacy act statement within each questionnaire.
- Next of kin: There are legal implications to next of kin (ie, this is the person who will make decisions, who VA will contact, who may receive money transfers). We should explain this, but not sure how much we need to explain. Would like legal to weigh in. 
- Next of kin: When we're asking for another person's information, do we put that in the labels? Danielle to make recommendation based, in part, on our work on the COVID-19 forms.
- Insurance: Kristen is confirming what we need to surface here.
- Timing of reviews: Insurance will come up for review every 90 days. Not sure yet about how often contact and next of kind information will come up for review. Kristen will find this out. This may affect how steps get combined.
- Contact center guide for sign-in: Danielle asked Chante if we have this. Chante looking into it.
- Usability testing: Kristen is heading into usability testing for the check-in piece only soon. Danielle to provide content recommendations for early next week in preparation.
