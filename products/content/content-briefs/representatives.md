## Overview

Speaking plainly, compassionately, and consistently across VA helps us build trust with Veterans, service members, and their family members. As we continue to move toward an omnichannel experience and multilingual content, consistency becomes even more important.  

This brief will help your team create content for your product that aligns with the VA.gov voice and content standards and that uses consistent language about representatives--people signing and acting on behalf of Veterans, service members, and family members. It will also help us all track content decisions so we can all stay aligned from discovery through post-launch iterations. This is a living document.

## Related terminology

**accredited representative**

We use this term to refer to a person or organization who's authorized by VA's Office the General Counsel to provide help with VA benefit claims to Veterans and service members, as well as their dependents and survivors. The accredited representative and the claimant must sign and submit VA Form 21-22 or VA Form 21-22a before the accredited representative can sign and submit other VA forms on behalf of the claimant.

Note on usage: Use "VA accredited representative" in the first instance. After that, "accredited representative" is OK. Lowercase, and define on first appropriate instance as “a person or organization who's authorized to help with VA benefit claims.” Include the definition in another sentence, as a parenthetical, or set off with commas. 

**alternate signer**

We use this term for a person who's certified to sign certain VA forms on behalf of someone else. For example, signing a disability claim on behalf of a Veteran. A person can certify as an alternate signer by submitting VA Form 21-0972.

**applicant**

We sometimes use this term to refer to the person applying for the benefit—-especially if the person is not a Veteran, or if they are not the person submitting the form (for example: “I’m signing for the applicant”). Go to [Claims and applications](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/specific-topics-and-programs/claims-and-applications) for more guidance related to this word. In general, don't use "non-Veteran." 

**claimant**

We sometimes use this term to refer to the person with the claim—-especially if the person is not a Veteran, or if they are not the person submitting the form (for example: “I’m signing for the claimant”). Always define the term on the first instance as “person with the claim.” When possible, use specific plain language instead, like “Veteran’s spouse” or “Veteran’s child.” Go to [Claims and applications](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/specific-topics-and-programs/claims-and-applications) for more guidance related to this word. In general, don't use "non-Veteran." 

Like this: “I’m the spouse, dependent, survivor, or caregiver of a Veteran, and I have an existing claim.” Not this: “I’m a non-Veteran claimant.”

**court-appointed guardian or legal conservator** 

We use this term in the identity space.

**fiduciary**

We use this term for a person with legal permission to receive benefit payments and make financial decisions on behalf of a Veteran. 

**form submitter**

We use this term, mostly internally, to refer to the person who's submitting the term. Don't use "form respondent."

**next of kin** 

We use this term in specific forms and contexts to refer to people, often relatives, who can legally make certain types of decisions for a Veteran and act as a point of contact. Next of kin can represent a Veteran's wishes for care, medical documentation, and benefits, if needed. 

**power of attorney**

We use this term to refer to the legal document that gives someone the permission to act on behalf of a Veteran in specific circumstances. We say that a person “has power of attorney” to describe their legal permissions. We don’t say that a person “is a power of attorney.” Since this term can mean many things depending on the context, we recommend replacing it with more specific terms, like "VA accredited representative," when appropriate. Don't use the initialism POA.  

Here are some types of power of attorney and related VA forms:
- “Durable power of attorney for health care” is permission to make health care decisions on behalf of a Veteran. 
  - VA Form 10-0137 gives this permission

- “Power of attorney for VA purposes” is limited permission for accredited representatives to communicate with VA on behalf of a Veteran in the context of their claims. 
  - VA Form 21-22 gives this permission for VSOs (then those VSOs authorize "VSO representatives" from their organization)
  - VA Form 21-22a gives this permission for accredited attorneys and claims agents
 
**sponsor**

We use this word in forms and other content to refer to the Veteran who earned the benefits that a family member may be using. It’s OK to use the word sponsor but lead with the plain language definition. Example: the Veteran you’re connected to (called your “sponsor”). Go to [Claims and applications](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/specific-topics-and-programs/claims-and-applications) for more guidance related to this word.

**third-party representative**

We use this general term for any person or organization with permission to act and communicate with VA on behalf of a Veteran. This includes accredited representatives, people with legal power of attorney, and fiduciaries. In most cases, we need to use more specific terms to describe the permissions a person has.

**Veterans Service Organization (VSO)** 

We use this term for organizations accredited by VA to help someone with their VA claims. We no longer use the term “Veterans Service Officer.” You can use “VSO representative” after spelling out the acronym VSO once on a page.

**Veterans Service Organization (VSO) representative** 

We use this term for individual representatives who belong to an accredited Veterans Service Organization (VSO). We no longer use the term “Veterans Service Officer.” You can use “VSO representative” after spelling out the acronym VSO once on a page.

### Retired terms 

**form respondent**

Use "form submitter." 

**Veterans Service Officer (VSO)** or **Veterans Service Representative (VSR)**

Use “Veterans Service Organization representative” or “VSO representative.” VA’s Office of General Counsel accredits the organization, not the individual.  


## Content considerations specific to representatives

Third-party representatives act or communicate **on behalf of** a Veteran — they don’t act **as** the Veteran.
