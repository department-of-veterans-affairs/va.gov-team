## Overview
Speaking plainly, compassionately, and consistently across VA.gov helps us build trust with Veterans, service members, and their family members. As we move toward preparing for translation, consistency becomes even more important.  

This brief will help your team create content for your product that aligns with the VA.gov voice and content standards and that uses consistent language about VA appointments. It will also help us all track content decisions so we can all stay aligned across channels. This is a living document.

## Related terminology

| Word or phrase | Notes | Reference | Last updated |
| -------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| **appointment** | Use "appointment" consistently (don't interchange with "visit" or other words) | VA content standards (not yet in style guide) | 7.20.22  |
| **check-in or check in** | This is the step that the person takes when they arrive. Use "check-in" (with hyphen) as a noun or adjective and "check in" (no hyphen) as a verb. Example: Complete the check-in process. vs. You can check in with your smartphone. | VA content standards (not yet in style guide) and AP style | 7.20.22  |
| **clinic** | Clinics at VA have two meanings. One is the physical location where an appointment may be held. The other refers to the scheduling grid VA uses. A single provider can have many "clinics" - even if all of them take place in the same physical location. A provider may have a different clinic grid for each day of the week, for the format of care (phone, in person, telehealth), or even for returning vs. new patients, which may impact the length of the appointment. As part of the self-scheduling process, Veterans may see multiple "clinics" listed, and need to know which is THEIR clinic, so they can self-schedule. This is a known pain point in VistA scheduling, which will be alleviated somewhat once sites move to Cerner. | VAOS product standard | 7.20.22 |
| **health care** | Always 2 words, no hyphen | VA content style guide standard | 7.20.22 |
| **health care provider** or **provider** | A Veteran's provider may be a doctor, nurse practitioner, physician's assistant, or other type of provider. Use "health care provider" on first mention and "provider" or "your provider" on subsequent mentions on a page/in a flow. Don't use "doctor" unless you're 100% sure that the person will specifically be a doctor. | VA content style guide standard | 7.20.22 |
| **health care facility** | Use this phrasing consistently for health care facilities (don't interchange with "VA location" or other words). You can shorten to "the facility" or "your facility" after first mention, unless there's a risk of confusion between VA and non-VA (i.e. community care) facilities. | 7.20.22 |
| **in-person or in person** | Use "in-person" (with hyphen) as a modifier and "in person" (no hyphen) in all other cases, including in a standalone label. Example: "You have an in-person appointment" vs. "You'll need to come to VA in person." | AP style  | 7.20.22 |
| **pre-check-in** | This is the step the person takes ahead of their appointment | VA content standards (not yet in style guide) | 7.20.22 |
| **request vs. schedule** | Veterans can self-schedule **some** types of appointments online. They can request other types of appointments. The option to self-schedule or request is not uniform across all types of care and VAMCs because it is controlled locally. | VAOS product |  7.20.22 |
| **sign in/sign out** | Use "sign in" and "sign out" consistently. Don't use "log in" at all. | VA.gov content style guide |  7.20.22 |
| **smartphone** | Veterans must have a smartphone (a mobile phone with internet access) to check in for appointments with their phone. Always use "smartphone" for this use case, not "mobile phone." | Check in content standard |  7.20.22 |
| **type of care** | Type of care refers to the specialty, i.e. primary care, mental health. | VAOS content standard  | 7.20.22 |


**Note:** Terms may evolve with usability testing.

## Research findings

- Mobile app research showed that 4/8 people found the "Pending" status label confusing. They wondered what it meant and if they needed to do something about an appointment that was "pending." However, previous research showed that Veterans understood "Pending" > "requested." There are additional complications to this. Guidance is to stay with "Pending" for now.
