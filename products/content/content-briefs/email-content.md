# VA content brief for VA email content

_WORK IN PROGRESS_

Created by the sitewide content team for teams working on email content. This brief focuses on emails using the VA Notify system and templates.

## Subject line

If the goal of the email is to prompt the Veteran to take an action, make the subject line a CTA starting with an action verb. If it's a reminder or confirmation email, make the subject line a short phrase or statement.

For example:
- VA appointment reminder
- We've received your application for burial benefits
- Review your dependent information for your VA benefits

(TBD guidance on word and character limits in subject lines. MailChimp says no more than 9 words and 60 characters.)

## Intro
In the intro paragraph, make the purpose of the email clear right away. If the Veteran needs to do something, end the intro paragraph with a CTA.

For example:
- We're writing to remind you about your upcoming VA health care appointments.
- We encourage you to review your dependent information on VA.gov once each year. This can help you avoid debt from benefit overpayments and find out if you're eligible for increased payments. Review your dependents online now.

## Closing
Some emails may need a closing that's specific to the person or program sending the email. If there's no need for a more specific closing, use the general closing "Thank you" on its own line with no punctuation. We don't need to add attribution to "VA.gov" or "the VA team."

**Note:** Don't say "Thank you for your service" in the closing or anywhere in the email.

## Links
VA Notify supports hyperlinks, but we also spell out the URL so that Veterans can feel sure the link is legitimate. This is especially important when the link goes to a tool that deals with personal, health, or financial information. 

Follow general VA.gov guidance for link text. Always include a destination like "on VA.gov" in link text, since we always need to specify the destination when linking from an email.

[Go to VA link guidance](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/links)

Follow this guidance for formatting links in emails:
- Hyperlink the link text
- Add the full URL in parentheses after the link text
- Include "https://www." so that the URL will work correctly if a recipient is on the VA network (a Veteran who is also a VA employee).

This way, a Veteran can choose to copy and paste the URL into their browser for extra security, or they can select the hyperlink for ease of use.

For example:
[Pay your copay bill on VA.gov](https://www.va.gov/health-care/pay-copay-bill/)
(https://www.va.gov/health-care/pay-copay-bill/)

## Headers
VA Notify does not support header levels below H2. 

Use H2 styling for the main headers in the email body content, to help screen reader users navigate the text.
