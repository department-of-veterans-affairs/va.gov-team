## Links
VA Notify supports hyperlinks, but we also spell out the URL so that Veterans can be sure the link is legitimate. This is especially important when the link goes to a tool that deals with personal, health, or financial information. 

Hyperlink the CTA link text. For example, "Pay your copay bill online now" 
Follow general VA.gov guidance for link text. 

Add the URL in parentheses after the hyperlink. Don't include "https://www." This way, a Veteran can choose to copy and paste the URL into their browser for extra security, or they can select the hyperlink for ease of use. 
For example:
[Pay your copay bill online now](https://www.va.gov/health-care/pay-copay-bill/)
(va.gov/health-care/pay-copay-bill/)

## Headers
VA Notify does not support header levels below H2. Use H2 styling for the main headers in the email body content, to help screen reader users navigate the text.
