# VA content brief for VA email content

Created by the sitewide content team for teams working on email content. This brief focuses on emails using the VA Notify system and templates.

## Subject line

If the goal of the email is to prompt the Veteran to take an action, make the subject line a CTA.
For example:
- Review your dependent information for your VA benefits

## Intro
The intro paragraph should state the most important information and make it clear what the Veteran needs to do.

For example:
We encourage you to review your dependent information on VA.gov once each year. This can help you avoid debt from benefit overpayments. And if you have new dependents to add, you may be eligible for increased benefit payments. Review your dependents online now.

## Closing
Some emails may need a closing that's specific to the person or program sending the email. If there's no need for a more specific closing, use the general closing "Thank you." Don't add attribution to "VA.gov" or "the VA team."

**Note:** Don't say "Thank you for your service" in the closing or anywhere in the email.

## Links
VA Notify supports hyperlinks, but we also spell out the URL so that Veterans can feel sure the link is legitimate. This is especially important when the link goes to a tool that deals with personal, health, or financial information. 



Follow general VA.gov guidance for link text. Include "on VA.gov" in link text, since we need to specify the destination when linking from an email.

- Hyperlink the CTA link text
- Add the full URL after the hyperlink with the text "Or copy and paste this link into your browser: [URL]" This way, a Veteran can choose to copy and paste the URL into their browser for extra security, or they can select the hyperlink for ease of use.
- Include "https://www." so that the URL will work correctly if a recipient is on the VA network (a Veteran who is also a VA employee).

For example:
[Pay your copay bill on VA.gov](https://www.va.gov/health-care/pay-copay-bill/)
Or copy and paste this link into your browser: https://www.va.gov/health-care/pay-copay-bill/

## Headers
VA Notify does not support header levels below H2. 

Use H2 styling for the main headers in the email body content, to help screen reader users navigate the text.
