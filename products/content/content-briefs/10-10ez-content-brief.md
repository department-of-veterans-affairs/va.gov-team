## Overview

Speaking plainly, compassionately, and consistently across VA.gov helps us build trust with Veterans, service members, and their family members. This brief will help your team create content for your product that aligns with the VA.gov voice and content standards. It will also help us all track content decisions so we can all stay aligned from discovery through post-launch iterations. This is a living document. We’ll work with your team to update it as we go.

## Established content standards for this product/benefit area


## The 5 basics 

Follow these content style best practices:
- **Use contractions** to achieve a conversational voice and tone (this helps avoid formal-sounding language). 
- **Keep it brief**
  - < 52 characters for H1s
  - < 70 characters for H2s
  - < 35 characters for buttons
  - < 20 to 25 words for sentences
- **Provide information using our Q&A formula**—as though you’re having a conversation with the Veteran on behalf of VA. The Veteran asks us questions in their voice, and we answer in ours. <br> **Example:** <br> How do I apply for VA health care? You can apply online now. If you need help, call us.
- **Add a plain language definition if you need to use a complex term.** The complex terms can come first or you can lead with the plain language description. <br> **Examples:** <br> You'll find your payroll deductions in a recent paycheck. Deductions include money withheld from your pay for things like taxes and benefits.
- **Use bold text in meaningful ways.** Don't overuse it or it'll lose its impact. See the [full style guide entry for how to use bold text effectively](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/bold-text).

## Research findings & working session notes

### 5.25.21 notes from research
- People want to know: Why we're asking each question? How we're going to use this?
- People don't know what qualifies for the different fields (spouse, parents, dependents, reimburseable expenses, etc.)  
- People are scared that the way they answer a question will automatically disqualify them. Specific to the military service section (it's just a long list of situations), if they get military compensation, financial disclosure (wish I knew exactly what the threshold is), whole household information section.  
- People want more information about their privacy (for example, how is my DD214 upload protected)
- On intro page:
  - People seem to like the prepare (list of things to gather)
  - People liked that there was a mention of dental and vision benefits
  - People didn't really mention the expectations after applying; they cared about that at the end
  - People's first instinct (more than half) was to click the top button  

### 6.4.21 notes

- Went over the reworked intro page to fit new content patterns. Agree with noting dental and vision benefits briefly in intro since people noted liking knowing this, but we don't want to add a bunch of extra info in the main body copy.
- Some folks don't understand what they're applying for. Can even think they're applying for disability benefits. Consider adding a brief mention in the intro about what VA health care is.
- We want to be mindful of the fear that some folks have about eligibility (ie, if I answer one question wrong, will I be automatically disqualified?). For example, we may want to include a note about how if your income changes, your priority group can be reconsidered.
- We want to balance being transparent with not having too many distractions. In usability testing, people who understand the additional information component like it, but some folks get confused about what these are. We'd love to test some different approaches (such as including additional info components with each step vs. including a bucket of accordions). The image below shows an example of the accordion approach. We also want to think about other ways to make this component more clear: Labeling, info icon, etc.

- We want to split out the optional info (income, expenses) in the preparation step. We need to wait for the business line to determine if income not needed in certain cases at all.
- We don't want to link off to other pages for more info (ie, eligibility, priority group, other insurance, after you apply) from this page because we don't want to confuse people or send them away from the application. We think we'll add these links on the confirmation screen.
