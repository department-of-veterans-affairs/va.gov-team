## Intro (5 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today! My name is  [CAROLA] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about the benefit information that's offered in Spanish on the VA.gov website. 

Before we start, I want to mention a few things:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** So please talk out loud as you have thoughts about each task. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve the website to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

Nextt, I'm going to send you a link to the VA webiste in the chat window. https://www.va.gov
Please go there now, and we'll start recording our session.
 

*Start recording.*

## Warm-Up Questions (10 minutes)

- Would you consider yourself a Veteran, a family member of a Veteran, or a caregiver for a Veteran
> Veteran, but wife is Mexican and Spanish speaking

- How would you describe your comfort level in English, for speaking and for reading? 
> I'm comfortable in Spanish conversationally but not really reading. Wife is proficient in English and is very comfortable speaking English with family, but her confidence speaking English with strangers isn't as comfortable.

  - Are there certain kinds of information you prefer to get in Spanish vs. English? 
> His wife will look up store websites and if there's a Spanish option, will use it. 

  - Tell me about a situation where you wished there was a Spanish language version. 

- What kinds of information do you typically look online for in Spanish vs. English? 

  - Tell me more about that.
  - Are certain formats more helpful (for example, website vs. downloadable PDFs vs. in-person help at a regional office)?

- How do you usually get information about VA benefits and services?
> On VA website but in English, and will share info with wife but verbally
> Like survivor benefit info in Spanish would be useuful in case anything ever happened to him, became incapicated or died. 
> I served with many Latino veterans but they were all fluent in English. But it would be for their family members maybe it could be helpful. 
  - For yourself or for someone else?

- Have you ever visited a VA website?
> Mostly eBenefits but it seems like it's slowly merging with va.gov. 
  - What were you trying to do?
  > Mostly look up pay history, GI Bill, Voc Rehab, medical records, disability claims, check on the status. 
  
  - Tell me about that experience.
  - What would you expect to find on VA.gov? 
    - In Spanish?
    - What type of benefit information would be most helpful to have in Spanish?

  



## First Task:  Find VA home loan benefits information  (10 minutes)

Can you see the chat window or icon? I am sending you a link, please click on it. 

*Send link: https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/JNRWYURRY5Q#/screens

Tell me how you would get started from here. 
> I expected the link to be in the top right hand corner. Took a second but found it.

(If they did not notice the Spanish link:) Please click on the link to see this page in Spanish. 

Tell me what you think here. 


What would you expect when you click on one of these links? 

(Have them click around and observe if they notice Spanish links or get confused by being sent to English pages from Spanish content.
> The menu links [he means the left nav] are in English. For me, it's fine but someone with limited English who needed this page in Spanish would need the menu in Spanish too. 

[He clicks on nav link.]

**(If they did not go to the How to Apply page:) Please go to the How to Apply (home loans) page.**

https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/JNRWYURRY5Q#/screens/362227909


Tell me what you think here. 
> I can go back n forth with my wife, flip back n forth from Spanish to English, to help his wife but verify with English for himself. 
> For example with paper applications, like for food stamps, I put it side by side, the English and Spanish version. Usually can't do that with websites. 
> Thinking more from the point of view of a mother or spouse, who would find Spanish helpful, not so much Veterans.
