## Intro (5 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today! My name is  [CAROLA] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about the benefit information that's offered in Spanish on the VA.gov website. 

Before we start, I want to mention a few things:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** So please talk out loud as you have thoughts about each task. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve the website to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

Nextt, I'm going to send you a link to the VA webiste in the chat window. https://www.va.gov
Please go there now, and we'll start recording our session.
 

*Start recording.*

> i don't know what my benefits are. i can go to my doctor, but someone was asking me  and I didn't know the answer. if i need to go to emergency room, where do i go? i have a whole bunch of hospitals near me, but they're not VA hospitals. can i go anywhere or i have to go to the va one.

> yeah, i guess so. yeah. 

> the benefits. i'm getting information, if i have a pension i can get more information about it. i see that on the left it's in english. wouldn't it be confusing for some ppl? not to me, but maybe some ppl looking for spanish, they might want the whole thing in spanish.

>  [he looks for survivors pension; clicks] i change it to spanish. it's lets say, it's straightforward [the info]. [ scans, scrolls] i don't see for example it's over here, the way to know if you're eligible it's concise, clear. 

> maybe i would... no answer is here. 




## Follow-up Questions (5 minutes)

- What did you notice in general about the pages that you saw today? 
> i like it, it's very clear, concise. if somebody comes for the first time, it's very simple. not too many fancy words. bc sometimes they use language like in court and most of the ppl are not, they don't want that. short information, not a lot of information about one thing. 
> to me, it's very helpful. i'm not gonna say 100 but 99% i found it in english or spanish and it's very clear. 

> to make it better, i would say, instead of read this page, click it and then everything in spanish, in stead of having to click it every time until you exit the page or whole thing. 

- Did you find anything particularly helpful or unhelpful? 

> no, i think everything is giving the answers to some of the questions i might have is here. 
> i have my kids, but we never talk about it, only me and my wife. 
> my brother. he lives here in AZ, but he'd rather have everythig, read everything in spanish. 
> no, his case is different. national guard for 20 years in PR and AZ. i've told him about this website to see if he qualifies, i know he is, but i don't think so. leaves everything for tomorrow. 
> [most helpful benefit to have in spanish] if i do qualify, that would be the first thing. i want to know before i get into reading more; and what would be my benefit if i qualify - pension, health service -- most veterans that i know are more concerned about health than anything else. 
> none of them heard of this web/page. i went to VA, i told him about webpage [site], va.gov. 
> my healthevet, the tool one that i go to. i look for information in spanish on va.gov, but not in myhealth - because i only check for my medication. so you know exactly where it is. but if i wan t to know more info about it, then i go to va and can read about it in spanish. 

- Do you have any other thoughts you would like to share? 

> [his wife] where i might need to go if i need to see, in case of an emergency, where should she take me, that way she won't have to call or ask around or go into the commputer in that moment, if she had that information to read through beforehand. 
> i'll say pamphlet in her case, so she knows where it is, right when she needs it. i think in the mail. a little bit old fashioned here. 
> if i, when i pass away, what benefits i have, what she can do, who she has to call, that would be useful. 
> i don't even have a cell phone. i rather use my laptop. my wife has a cell phone. on the phone, yes, useful, but she prefer getting mail. she likes to file. 
> 

- Or questions?
