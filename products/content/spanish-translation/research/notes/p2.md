## Intro (5 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today! My name is  [CAROLA] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about the benefit information that's offered in Spanish on the VA.gov website. 

Before we start, I want to mention a few things:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** So please talk out loud as you have thoughts about each task. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve the website to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

Nextt, I'm going to send you a link to the VA webiste in the chat window. https://www.va.gov
Please go there now, and we'll start recording our session.

## Warm-Up Questions (10 minutes)

- Would you consider yourself a Veteran, a family member of a Veteran, or a caregiver for a Veteran
> yes, Veteran

- How would you describe your comfort level in English, for speaking and for reading? 
> both, fully proficient
  - Are there certain kinds of information you prefer to get in Spanish vs. English? 
>depends on nature - technical in english; translated content instead of being standardized is too regional 

  - Tell me about a situation where you wished there was a Spanish language version. 

- What kinds of information do you typically look online for in Spanish vs. English? 
> news in spanish; sometimes if it has a lot of regional i'll turn it into english; books in spanish to keep up proficiency.
  - Tell me more about that.
  - Are certain formats more helpful (for example, website vs. downloadable PDFs vs. in-person help at a regional office)?

- How do you usually get information about VA benefits and services?
> prefer benefits info in english. don't gtrrust VA's translation. matter of perception - not the greatest org to interact with, so something critical like my benefits, i don't expect the to do a good job. example of appointments, they were so careless, so i would not trust translation that did not have someone's hands on it, was jut a machine translating it. 



- Have you ever visited a VA website?
> not recently. 

  - What were you trying to do?
  >filing a compnesation claim - uploading all of that info; also i looked for confirmation of service letter; also for va loan - had to go through ebenefits and all that. but other than than i dont go to the va website. 

> will go to look for info for someone else, like a veteran friend who can't find it on the va website or can't understand the info. so i help them find information they're unable to. 
  - Tell me about that experience.
  
  - What would you expect to find on VA.gov? 
    - In Spanish?
   > context and navigation - if they're in spanish context, it should not change to english. 
   > my doctor's notes - i want to have access to those notes - i want to know why if the results are not what i expected, and i know it's not hippa related. 
  
   
    - What type of benefit information would be most helpful to have in Spanish?
>not that i'm aware but I didn't even know the VA site is available in spanish.

> very familiar with the content. [he scans and scrolls - reads] lost COE here, maybe bold it?
> [he goes back to English version] reserve members are veterans; a little bit confusing - English and spanish]; 
> tell me something is going to english if it goes to english; it's a little bit light - i mean this question is misplaced or not at the right level; if the button was placed to each of those [accordions rather than outside of them]; and go to the green [button].
> front load the apply button.

> if i was browsing somethin in spanish, why am i back to something in english. 
> [he clicks back n forth between english and spanish] this COE - in home loans it comes at a different place; in english it's capitalized, but in spanish it's not. 
> [ scans and reads page and links] the structure here seems more helpful than in eligibility.

> [clicks to spanish, scans, reads] super helpful to spell out COE...
> [tries to find how to apply] structure on this is challenging - i can't get a COE unless I'm already receiving benefits; [flips between English and spanish]
