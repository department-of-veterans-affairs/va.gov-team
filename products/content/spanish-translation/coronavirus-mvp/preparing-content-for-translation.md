# Checklist for content readiness for translation

## General 

- [ ] Text is free of spelling and grammatical errors.
- [ ] Text is written in sentence casing.
- [ ] Text uses active voice.
- [ ] Text contains no idioms, slang, jargon, or culturally specific information.
- [ ] Text is written all in English, and avoids common phrases borrowed from other languages.

| Like this | Not like this |
|---|---|
| Call when you're on your way to the hospital | Call when you're en route to the hospital |

- [ ] Text is succinct and avoids redundancies (ie, "It is useful to remember to wear a mask that covers your mouth and nose." > "Wear a mask that covers your mouth and nose.")
- [ ] Text uses consistent terms and avoids synonyms (ie, "sign in" is always "sign in" and not "log in" in some instances, "click twice" is always "click twice" and not "double click" in some instances).

## Sentences

- [ ] Sentences are between 5 and 20 words.
- [ ] Each sentence conveys 1 thought and contains 1 active verb.
- [ ] Each sentence is complete. It begins with a capital letter, includes at least one main clause, and has an ending punctuation. _For discussion: What should we do about our approach to bullets with no periods and sometimes phrases rather than complete sentences?_

## Bulleted lists

- [ ] Text avoids standalone phrases, except in headlines and subheadings.
- [ ] Lead-ins to bulleted lists are complete sentences.
- [ ] In bulleted lists, each list item is complete and parallel.
- [ ] Text is as free as possible of amibigous words (example, use "after" or "when" instead of "once").
- [ ] Text specifies nouns with "the."
- [ ] Text has as few pronouns as possible (especially avoiding the pronoun "it"). Repeat the noun in a sentences rather than using a pronoun.
- [ ] Text avoids demonstrative pronouns (ex. replace "This allows you to" with "This function allows you to").
- [ ] Text avoids or limits compound words.
- [ ] Text avoids the conditional (ex. replace "This would open the window" with "This will open the window").
- [ ] Dates are written in non-numeric format.
- [ ] Text avoids abbreviations whenever possible (including Latin abbreviations such as "i.e.: and "etc.").
- [ ] Text avoids "and/or," indicating the plural by using (s), and indicating "and" by using an "&".
- [ ] Text uses the Oxford comma.
- [ ] Text avoids acronyms as much as possible. When text uses acronyms, they are always spelled out on the first instance. </br> **For Spanish content:** The first instance of an acronym in the body copy (not in titles or subheads) on a page appears as the words spelled out, followed by the acronym and "sigla en inglés" in parentheses. For example, "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)" becomes "Centros de Control y Prevención de Enfermedades (CDC, sigla en inglés)." For all following instances, just use the acronym _Question for discussion: With the Google translate widget, we can't add "sigla en inglés" to the Spanish translation unless we add "acronym in English" to the original content. So this would appear as "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, acronym in English)." Let's discuss what's best for now._
- [ ] Links to pages that won't be translated into Spanish include...
