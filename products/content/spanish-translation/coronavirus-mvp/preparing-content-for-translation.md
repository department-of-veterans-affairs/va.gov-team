# Checklist for content readiness for translation

## General grammar, style, and punctuation

- [ ] Text is free of spelling, punctuation, and grammatical errors.
- [ ] Tone of the writing is conversational.
- [ ] Text is written in sentence casing.

- [ ] Text avoids indicating the plural by using (s).
- [ ] Text avoids indicating "and" by using an "&".

## Sentences

- [ ] Sentences are no more than 25 words in length. Aim for sentences between 5 and 20 words whenever possible.
- [ ] In general, each sentence conveys 1 thought and contains 1 active verb. There may be exceptions where a sentence with 2 active verbs is necessary to avoid awkward writing. (Example 1 active verb: **Start** your application for disability compensation now. Example 2 active verbs: Depending on the type of claim you file, you may **gather** supporting documents yourself, or you can **ask** our help to gather evidence.)
- [ ] Each sentence within the body text is complete. It starts with a capital letter and includes:
  - A subject
  - A verb
  - Ending punctuation


_Note:_ Phrases are OK in headlines, subheads, and bullets within a list. [ADD EXAMPLE]

## Words and phrases

- [ ] Text contains no idioms, slang, jargon, or culturally specific information.

- [ ] Text is as free as possible of ambiguous words (e.g. use "after" or "when" instead of "once").
- [ ] Text specifies nouns with "the." (exception: "VA" uses just "VA" and not "the VA"). [ADD EXAMPLE]
- [ ] Text has as few pronouns as possible (especially avoiding the pronoun "it"). Repeat the noun in a sentence rather than using a pronoun.

- [ ] Text avoids demonstrative pronouns (e.g. replace "This allows you to" with "This function allows you to").
- [ ] Text avoids or limits compound words wherever possible, and contains simple words.
- [ ] Text avoids the conditional (e.g. replace "This would open the window" with "This will open the window").
- [ ] Text avoids abbreviations (including Latin abbreviations such as "i.e.: and "etc.").
- [ ] Text avoids "and/or". 
- [ ] Text avoids acronyms as much as possible. When text uses acronyms, they are always spelled out in the first instance. </br> **For Spanish content:** For acronyms, use the spelled-out term on the first mention in the body text (not in titles or subheads) followed by the acronym in parentheses. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) translates to "Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades (CDC, por sus siglas en inglés)." Then use just the acronym for all instances on the rest of the page. 

## Bulleted lists

- [ ] Lead-ins to bulleted lists are complete sentences.
- [ ] In bulleted lists, each list item is parallel in construction.
- [ ] In bulleted lists, each list item is a complete sentence wherever possible. There may be exceptions when a phrase or single word makes sense.
- [ ] Dates are written in non-numeric format (e.g. April 16, 2024, or January 2, 1980).


## URLs and links to other pages

- [ ] Links to pages that aren’t translated include (in English) as part of the link. This should then be translated into the language of the page. **Note:** This is a specific 508 requirement.
