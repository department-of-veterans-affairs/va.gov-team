## Overview
We'll create a step-by-step approach to localization that will provide essential COVID-19 content about VA health care and benefits in Spanish while allowing us to quickly gather data and user feedback that will help to inform a sustainable localization solution for digital content.

## Problem Statement
Veterans and their family members who are low English proficiency (LEP) or who are more comfortable reading information in their primary language don't have easy and consistent access to translated content online.

VA has existing guidance for complying with Executive Order 13166, Improving Access to Services for Persons with Limited English Proficiency, 65 Fed. 50,121 (Aug. 16, 2000). But VA currently doesn't currently prioritize localization of digital content in a programmatic and sustainable way. Translated materials are available, but they're scattered and there is no current organization-wide program to ensure that we're translating essential content or keeping translated content accurate and up-to-date. 

We also don't have a full understanding of our low English proficiency audience, including the number of people who may need or want translated content, what languages they most need content in, or what their health literacy, cultural, or other needs might be. Gaining a better understanding of our audience will help us ensure that our translated content delivers the greatest possible value.

Congress has recently asked VHA to provide COVID-19 content (and other essential content) in Spanish. We want to help meet this important and timely need while also working toward an effective and sustainable approach for the future.

**How might we meet these 3 important, but potentially disparate goals, at the same time?** 
1. Provide essential COVID-19 content in Spanish for our LEP Veterans and family members
2. Demonstrate that VHA is making progress on providing more content in Spanish
3. Quickly gather the data, user feedback, and audience research information we need to recommend an effective and sustainable organization-wide localization program
 
## Desired User Outcomes

- Veterans and their family members and caregivers can get the information they need in the language most comfortable for them (first Spanish, then other languages as identified)
- Low English proficiency (LEP) Veterans and their family members and caregivers can better understand VA benefits and services so they can access the care, benefits, and services they need

## Undesired User Outcomes

- Veterans and family members find content confusing or unhelpful
- Veterans and family members can't easily find or use translated content

## Desired Business Outcomes

- VHA demonstrates to Congress that we are providing essential COVID-19 information in Spanish
- DEPO/OCTO Health provides a solid recommendation for a sustainable localization program at VA, based on data and user feedback
- VA provides relevant, easy-to-find, high-quality content for LEP Veterans and their families in the languages they most need

## Undesired Business Outcomes

- VHA can't demonstrate progress on translation efforts in a timely way
- DEPO/OCTO Health can't gather the data we need to make solid recommendations for localization
- VA continues with a scattered or unsustainable approach to localization

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- Analytics around the use of the translation on select page(s)
- Satisfaction survey connected to translation
- Call center inquiries
- Direct user feedback via usability testing

#### Baseline KPI Values

From March 15, 2020, to October 11, 2020, these are the total number of users visiting the coronavirus FAQs in languages other than English:

- es-us - Spanish (United States): 11,459 
- es-419 - Spanish (Latin America and Caribbean region): 4,658
- es-xl - Spanish (Mexico?): 4,569
- es-es - Spanish (Spain): 3,507
- zh-ch - Chinese (People's Republic of China): 684
- ko-kr - Korean (Korea): 422
- de-de - German (Germany): 124
- ko - Korean: 97
- fr-fr - French (France): 51

### Objectives and Key results (OKRs)

- Objective: Meet Veterans' and their family members' need for COVID-19 information about VA health care and benefits in Spanish while gathering data to inform recommendations for a longer-term localization solution.
  - Key result: Provide high-quality translation of the coronavirus FAQs page and coronavirus research volunteer list page/form by January 20, 2020.
  - Key result 2: Analyze data around usage of, and need for, VA content in Spanish by May 2020.
  - Key result 3: Research localization best practices and potential tools and processes for recommendation by May 2020.

## Assumptions
- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumption w/your initial set of functionality*

- Some Veterans and their family members need or prefer COVID-19 content about VA health care and benefits in Spanish.
- We can optimize our content for translation enough that the Google translate widget will be an acceptable translation option for our MVP. **Update:** We are finding through best practice research, conversations with localization experts, and quality assessments, that we likely will need to incorporate a human factor into translation. 
- Users will be able to find and easily toggle to translated content. **Update:** We are finding that we'll likely need a unique url for the page in order to make the translated content findable and be able to track user intent in coming to the page.  

## Solution Approach

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
We are going to start with translating the coronavirus FAQs page via front-end solution (not involving Drupal). We'll then widen translation to the health care benefit hub, and then further as data shows is warranted. **Update:** We are focusing first on all coronavirus content (FAQs + coronavirus research) and we are exploring options for technical solution.

We've decided to start there for 2 primary reasons:
1) VA doesn't have the data to show user needs at this time. This solution allows us to begin gathering data quickly to help inform a longer-term solution.
2) This approach requires no Drupal integration. At this time, we don't have the people capacity for efforts that do require Drupal support.

- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
This is the quickest and simplest solution that allows us to start providing translated content while quickly gathering the data we need to inform a longer-term solution.

- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
We're not including Drupal integration because we don't have the resources to support the work.

- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*
We'll base the evolution on data and user feedback. We expect that we'll move toward a machine-and-human translation approach as part of a broader localization program.

## Go-to-market Strategy
- *How are Veterans and others using this product going to know it exists?*
We'll need to reach specific audiences who may need content translated into Spanish. We aim to do this through:
  
- *What marketing, outreach, or communications are necessary for this product to be successful?*
Outreach may include:
  - Working with the VA health equity office, center for minority Veterans, patient advocates, and relevant VSOs to communicate to LEP Veterans and family members that we invite them to try this offering and give us feedback to help us improve the experience.
   - Targeted social media and other communication outreach efforts
- [Link to Release Plan](#go-to-market-strategy)

## Launch Dates
- *Target Launch Date*
  - October 15, 2020 for first iteration (coronavirus FAQs page) - **Update:** Delayed due to lack of people capacity and ability to implement as well as concerns with Google Translate widget quality. We are now aiming for January 20, 2021 for coronavirus FAQs page + coronavirus research volunteer list.
- *Actual Launch Date* 
  - tbd
- *What date will you evaluate impact after launch?*
  - **Updated:** 3 months post launch

## Solution Narrative

### Current Status

Preparation work continued, but development work was delayed due to lack of people and ability to implement as well as concerns with Google Translate widget quality. We are kicking off this project with the VSP platforms team on 11.24.20.
