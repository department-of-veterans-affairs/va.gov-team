- Have a Language Access Committee.

- Refer to Real Academia Espanola (https://www.rae.es/), the gold standard for proper Spanish. We also look at bilingual media for terms that we know our resonating.

- Many sites use Google translate first. If you start with machine first, usually your product is somewhat machine line. We have humans involved from the start. When we go back to technology, we do it to confirm, little nuances of cultural, grammar checks. But ideally it does start and end with a human set of eyes with technology in the middle. 

- With a contemporary subject (like COVID-19), we'll look at other government sites to see how they're talking about it. It's painfully obvious when they use machine translation.

- Full Spanish team is 2 FTEs. We have some original content that we translate, but the bulk of our content is licensed. As part of the licensed content, we require that it comes to us in 2 languages. We then do original translations for the health topic summaries.

- For licensed content, we know that it goes through people as well. From time to time, we encounter terms that are more regional so we have to edit into more universal Spanish.

- The more translators you have look at content, the better. This brings different perspectives. For the most part, we take on translations across the board in a team effort. Either my colleague initiates and I polish or vice versa. Try to have 2 people look at it. Sometimes debate and discuss to collaborate on final product. Sometimes have to go outside agency to see how others are talking about a topic. Collaboration is key. 

- When we make updates in English, it prompts an immediate reaction on the Spanish side. Edits to multiple pages may require a rewrite. We don't view translation as an "extra" step. It is an integral part of the task. We hold the release of content until both English and Spanish are ready. We have to be able to prioritize requests.

- $25/page for PDF; 6 to 10 cents per word for web content. It's expensive.

- Must read for context and readilibility. Have an editorial board. Takes a lot of staff time, cultural sensitivity, and specialized expertise. 

- Quality over quantity. Make sure the synopsis is translated well and is culturally sensitive. A lot of people who are bilingual benefit from a high quality synopsis. Then they'll go seek Google translate or another way of translating for the rest.

- The consumers of translated content is not always the target audience. Consider the caregiver perspective as well.




## Designing for translation: A Digital.gov multilingual and content web managers community meeting

### Design guidance

- Take a comprehensive approach to language. Who needs to know this information? Would non-English speaking groups benefit from it? If yes, what languages are needed? Plan your content with these answers in mind.
- Design with the differences in languages in mind: 
  - Text length (or text swell), with romance languages taking up 15% to 20% more room
  - Text direction and special characters (people scan the way they read): https://www.w3.org/International/articles/inline-bidi-markup/
  - Decide on a style for dates and numbers and stick to it to avoid confusion (refer to the USA.gov bilingual style guide for dates and money style)
- Avoid idioms
- Don't provide a customer experience where the customer has to go through the English website to get to the Spanish (or other language) site. Offer them a dedicated URL. Otherwise, Google will not find the content and users won't be able to bookmark the page. Use international convention for URLs.
- In translation contracts, put in a clause stating that translations must be done in the U.S. Otherwise, you may produce content that is not culturally relevant or is even offensive.
- Write in plain language and prepare your content for translation. The more you help your translators, the better your translation will be and the less it will cost.
- Layout and imagery:
  - Allow space for the text to fit in the layout. Consider designing for longer languages first. (Consider this for buttons, H1s, etc!)
  -	Take into account the direction of the text.
  -	Use international symbols. 
  - For images – think about culture. Do they convey the same meaning in different cultures?
  -	Beware of automatic hyphenation 
- Q. What is meaningful access under the law? A. This varies with each person's and agency's interpretation. Generally, check the agency's Office of Civil Rights intepretation.
- Q. If not all content is translated, what’s the best practice for menus? Should we translate the menu text even if it’s linking to a non-translated page? A. Yes, so people can navigate.
- Q. We’re not able to translate all material. Should we create a language page? A. When you have just portions of your website that will be in other languages, that brings up a different issue. YOu're always going to have in English page, you’re going to have portions of pages translated. Give those portions a url even if all of the comment elements are still in English.
  - Comment from attendee who manages content for IRS.gov: We use Drupal's multilingual module and it allows multilingual children if needed. The user can select to be in one of the language channels and it will automatically populate a banner on an English-only page that says "This page is not available in Spanish." We really like the experience; came from open text. It's very easy and simple to create a translation for any given page. We've done some usability testing.
- Q. We don't use machine translation because it's not always accurate. How do you use that?
  - A. IRS attendee: We don’t use machine translation at all. We have translation services that we use. Drupal multilingual is just like any other content updating – we go in and make the changes.
  - A. Presenter: We really recommend not using Google translate. I want to be very clear because there’s a lot of machine translation that is done well, but nothing can published without editing. It’s gotten a lot better, but it must be edited. Check that it’s in your voice. We really discourage a Google translate button. 
  - Q. Are machine translations ever a good idea for the interim?
  - A. Presenter: No. You’re responsible for offering information that may be completely inaccurate. I mean, we’re the government.
  - A. Another attendee: Auto translation is not a good idea. Not just because it’s bad…Spanish speakers will notice that you didn’t put any effort into it. You lose a lot of credibility when you use an automatic translation and people notice.
  - A. Presenter: Also the URL, you will get different translations.
  - Q. How do you educate your leadership about this?
  - A. Presenter: That's the million dollar question. It goes to relationships and education.
  - Q. But when is perfect the enemy of good? What are the tipping points for different agencies, priorities, and budgets? Machine translation has 90% or higher accuracy. The language is stilted, yes, but there's a difference between stilted language and inaccurate language.
  - A. Presenter: In the case of the pandemic, you don't want to add to the disinformation and misinformation that's already out there. It's an individual decision for each agency.  
  - Q. Do we have a way of coming up with criteria for "when it hits this mark, it's good enough"?
  - A. Presenter: Not at this time. Someone could undertake that as a study.
- Q. What kind of testing do you do to see if the chosen tone or language is working?
- A. Right now, almost no testing.
- Q. How do you balance the cost of translation with so many languages?
- A. Go with your population or with what the Census tells you. Do a cut off.
- Attendee tip: We use Clay Tablet to send our translations to the vendor. This takes a huge amount of the day-to-day CMS work largely out of the equation in terms of the work required by the web team to manage translations. Also, our translation vendor provides us with several rush options that are helpful in emergencies.
- Attendee tip: Systran out-of-the-box is a lot better, but it's a heavy lift of a product. In an emergency if you don't have an editor, you can put it up.
- Attendee tip: Check out HHS.gov Language Plan of Access.
