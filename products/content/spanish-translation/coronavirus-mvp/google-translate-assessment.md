# Google translate widget 

## Initial research summary

### Benefits 

- The free Google translate widget is available for government sites during the coronavirus pandemic. 

- This approach requires a low level of tech effort, and would be a quick solution to providing COVID-19 content and gathering data.

### Risks & drawbacks 

- Given that this widget wasn’t supported in the past, and is being supported again for the COVID-19 pandemic, this will likely not be a long-term solution.

- Government sites that currently use the widget include disclaimers noting the potential for inaccuracy and relinquishing liability for these inaccuracies (see examples below). Digital.gov strongly discourages the use of machine or automatic translations as a sole solution and the use of such disclaimers. A U.S. Department of Labor Civil Rights Center report on ensuring meaning access for LEP individuals also recommends against a machine tranlsation only approach (note: I did find one DOL site – OSHA.gov – that appears to be using the Google Translate widget). Our conversation with the translation experts at MedLine Plus and leaders in the government multilingual community supports the same recommendation that machine-only translation is not sufficient for quality. 

-	To ensure that we’re providing accurate Spanish-language content, this approach would require up-front content preparation effort as well as post-editing by a professional translator (note: determining whether we will be able to have post-editing control to correct inaccuracies is key and our next step). Our own quality assessment via back-translation and quality ranking (using the BLEU 0-6 ranking scale) by a bilingual VHA colleague shows that while Google translate does a decent job some of the time in translating English content to Spanish, it does not generally produce high-quality translations of our content. Out of 41VA.gov FAQs, our colleague ranked only 3 as “high quality translation,” 21 as “understandable to good translation,” and 17 as “the gist is clear, but has significant grammatical errors.” 

- The widget quality will not scale to other languages. Reading of the literature available on this topic shows that Spanish is one of the best quality outputs for Google Translate. The translation quality goes down especially for languages such as Chinese. This is an issue in particular because data shows that Chinese is the 2nd most common language spoken by low English proficiency (LEP) U.S. residents (Spanish is #1) and the 3rd most common language other than English that Veterans who are immigrants to the U.S. report speaking at home. Further, our current Coronavirus FAQs page analytics data shows that, while a small audience, users who are changing the language of the page currently are choosing Spanish most often, but Chinese 2nd most often. 

-	The ability to gather accurate usage data may be limited by the on-page nature of the widget. If we don’t have a separate Spanish-language page, the Spanish content won’t appear in search results. If we only provide a translation option on one page with no translation of site navigation, users navigating the site will only know this translated content exists if they’re on this one page. Both of these limit findability and awareness of Spanish-language content.
