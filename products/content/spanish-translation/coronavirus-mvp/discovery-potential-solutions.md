# Potential solutions for localization

Below are descriptions of potential solutions recommended by colleagues at DEPO and USDS as well as the digital.gov multicultural community presentation.

## Crowdin

- Free for open source projects
- Integrates well with GitHub
- Provides a way to collaborate simultaneously with translators from one or more agencies on the same project (including voting on best translation option and tools to discuss translations, ask questions, mark irrelevant translations, and request more context). This could be particularly helpful if we have VHA's community of volunteers, as we could work with both them and professional translators on the same platform. Can find a translator find via Crowdin (or invite others to join project).
- Provides automated quality assurance

- Provides option for in-context overlay that allows translators and proofreaders to work in the live application and instantly preview translations in context: https://support.crowdin.com/in-context-localization/

## Translations.com

- Uses machine translation to speed up high-volume workloads, with human translators checking each step. Achieved full certification to the ISO 18587 standard for translation quality using artificial intelligence methods.
- Instant website translator option (WorldLingo):
  - Low effort implementation
  - Can customize to match site design
  - Provides real-time translation across site
  - Translates up to 14 languages. Note that on initial inspection, it looks like this tool doesn't offer translation to Tagalog. This could present an issue, given our audience needs.
  - Can improve translation quality with a terminology glossary and custom dictionary
  - Can translate user entries back to English for searches, feedback, forms
  - Provides detailed user statistics to learn customer language preferences
- Translation API (WorldLingo):
  - SaaS solution - notes that this can be easily integration and running in a few hours
  - Allows for greater customization (not a lot of info on this)
- Chat translation (WorldLingo) for real-time multilingual chat
  
## Drupal multilingual modules

- A .gov site content manager noted using and liking Drupal multilingual modules. This content manager noted that they use this for managing the translated content, but still use human translators for the actual translation. This may be a longer-term option, dependent on CMS team capacity. More information: https://www.drupal.org/docs/multilingual-guide
