# Hardening benefit detail pages

## About the benefit (main page)

- High-level overview of the benefit and what it offers
- We don't currently have documentation for a template for these pages. We'd like to create a template for a basic, high level overview of a benefit with links to more information.
- We should also talk about how to handle an "about" page about 1 benefit (like [VA health care](https://www.va.gov/health-care/about-va-health-benefits/) vs. an "about" page about a benefit that has subbenefit options like the [GI bill about page](https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/) or the [life insurance options page](https://www.va.gov/life-insurance/options-eligibility/). 
  - **Note:** We are in the process of revisiting pages like the about VA health care page and moving much of the content into resources & support, look at shorter, declarative headers rather than questions, etc.
- Would like to be reuse content more. For example:
  - "More questions you may have about eligibility": Add reusable single Q&As
  - "More information"/"related links": Have related link descriptions be reusable so content authors don't need to retype each time they add a link.

## Benefit eligibility (main page)

- We have [existing documentation for the eligibility page template](https://design.va.gov/patterns/benefit-applications#eligibility-hierarchy).
- Would like to be reuse content more. For example:
  - "More questions you may have about eligibility": Add reusable single Q&As
  - "More information"/"related links": Have related link descriptions be reusable so content authors don't need to retype each time they add a link.
  
## How to apply (main page)

- We have [existing documentation for the how to apply page template](https://design.va.gov/patterns/benefit-applications#how-to-apply)
- Would like to be reuse content more. For example:
  - "More questions you may have about eligibility": Add reusable single Q&As
  - "More information"/"related links": Have related link descriptions be reusable so content authors don't need to retype each time they add a link.

## After you apply

- We have [existing documentation for the after you apply page template](https://design.va.gov/patterns/benefit-applications#after-you-apply)
- Would like to be reuse content more. For example:
  - "More questions you may have about eligibility": Add reusable single Q&As
  - "More information"/"related links": Have related link descriptions be reusable so content authors don't need to retype each time they add a link.

## Benefit rates paid to Veterans

- We are still in the process of migration rates information. We should likely leave hardening a template for rates information for post-MVP.

## Examples of additional content that uses the benefit detail page template

- Pages about evidence needed to apply
- Pages with deeper eligibility information (variation) 
- Benefit rates pages
- Pages about priority groups (health care)
- Copay rates (that Veterans pay for care)
- Other informational pages

Note that we are in the process of determining which of these pages should move into Resources and Support. Most of them likely will move.
