# Hardening benefit detail pages

Here is information about the different core pages that we use the benefit detail page for now.

## About the benefit (main page)

- High-level overview of the benefit and what it offers
- We don't currently have documentation for a template for these pages. We're going to create documentation for a basic, high level overview of a benefit with links to more information.
- We should also talk about how to handle an "about" page about 1 benefit (like [VA health care](https://www.va.gov/health-care/about-va-health-benefits/) vs. an "about" page about a benefit that has subbenefit options like the [GI bill about page](https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/) or the [life insurance options page](https://www.va.gov/life-insurance/options-eligibility/). 
  - **Note:** We are in the process of revisiting pages like the about VA health care page and moving much of the content into resources & support, look at shorter, declarative headers rather than questions, etc.
- Would like to eventually be able to reuse content more (not necessarily MVP). For example:
  - "More questions you may have about eligibility": Add reusable single Q&As
  - "More information"/"related links": Have related link descriptions be reusable so content authors don't need to retype each time they add a link.

## Benefit eligibility (main page)

- We have [existing documentation for the eligibility page template](https://design.va.gov/patterns/benefit-applications#eligibility-hierarchy).
- Would like to eventually be reuse content more (not necessarily MVP). For example:
  - "More questions you may have about eligibility": Add reusable single Q&As
  - "More information"/"related links": Have related link descriptions be reusable so content authors don't need to retype each time they add a link.
  
## How to apply (main page)

- We have [existing documentation for the how to apply page template](https://design.va.gov/patterns/benefit-applications#how-to-apply)
- Would like to eventually be reuse content more (not necessarily MVP). For example:
  - "More questions you may have about eligibility": Add reusable single Q&As
  - "More information"/"related links": Have related link descriptions be reusable so content authors don't need to retype each time they add a link.

## After you apply

- We have [existing documentation for the after you apply page template](https://design.va.gov/patterns/benefit-applications#after-you-apply)
- Would like to eventually be reuse content more (not necessarily MVP). For example:
  - "More questions you may have about eligibility": Add reusable single Q&As
  - "More information"/"related links": Have related link descriptions be reusable so content authors don't need to retype each time they add a link.

## Benefit rates paid to Veterans

- We are still in the process of migration rates information. We should likely leave hardening a template for rates information for post-MVP.

## Examples of additional content that uses the benefit detail page template

- Pages about evidence needed to apply
- Pages with deeper eligibility information (variation) 
- Benefit rates pages
- Pages about priority groups (health care)
- Copay rates (that Veterans pay for care)
- Other informational pages

Note that we are in the process of determining which of these pages should move into Resources and Support, as part of an effort to streamline benefit hubs. Many of these likely will move.
