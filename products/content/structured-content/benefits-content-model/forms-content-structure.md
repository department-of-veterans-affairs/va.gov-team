# Forms content model

This is a working file to begin to capture structured content for forms.

## Basic form information

- **VA form number:** The official number that VA assigns this form. For example, the 10-10EZ or the 526-EZ.
- **Official form name:** This is the official form name. This is often times a lengthy, complex name.
- **Plain language form name:** This is the plain language name we give to the form.
- **OMB number:** This is the OMB number for the form, found on the PDF form.
- **Form revision date:** This is the date the form was last revised, found on the PDF form.
- **Form expriation date:** This is the date the form expires with OMB, found on the PDF form.
- **Respondent burden (or "How long we estimate it will take to complete this form"):** This is the estimated length of time for completing the form (based on the PDF), found on the PDF form.
- **Privacy statement:** Would be great to be able to include the privacy statement in the content model, whether for current or future needs. Possibly other statements/areas like this. Let's consider more.

## Relational information
- **Parent form:** Some forms are "supporting forms" for other forms. We'll want to establish that relationship.
- **Supporting forms:** Same as above, we'll want to establish the supporting form relationship. 
- **Parallel, or combined, form:** We are in the process of combining some forms online, so we'll need a way to address this in the model.
- **Form type:** Let's consider how best to capture form type (i.e. application, etc.).
- **Related benefit or benefits:** The benefit or benefits this form relates to. Some supporting forms may relate to multiple benefits.
- **Who can submit this form:** Let's consider how best to capture form audiences/submitter. Some forms will have multiple people who need to fill out the form. 

## Information about preparing to fill out the form

- **When to use this form:** Plain language instructions on when to use this form.
- **What to know before you fill out this form:** Any specific warnings, disclaimers, etc. a person needs to know before filling out the form.
- **Check eligibility summary:** This is like what we have on intro pages to forms now (example at: https://www.va.gov/health-care/apply-for-health-care-form-10-10ez/introduction). Let's consider how to best add this into the model without duplicative eligibility content model.
- **Information you'll need to fill out this form:** Bulleted list of information and documents you'll need to submit this form.

## Ways to submit the form 

- **Overview of ways to submit the form:** Brief overview of the different ways to fill out this form. Let's consider how to best frame this. For applications, we'll want front-end headers and content to be able to be framed as "Ways to apply." But not all forms are applications.
- **Instructions to submit the form online:**
- **Instructions to submit the form by mail:**
- **Instructions to submit the form in peron:**
- **Instructions to submit the form by fax:**
- **How to get help with submitting the form:** 
- **CTA to online form:** An action link to the online version of the form (if available), such as "Apply online now." The current link label for this in About Form page template is "Go to the online tool," which is generic enough to be used across any form but also not great. Let's consider how to customize link label here.
- **CTA to download form:** Download link to download the PDF version of the form from the Forms database.
