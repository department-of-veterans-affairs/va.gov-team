# VA Benefits Taxonomy Product Brief

## Overview
The VA Benefits Taxonomy is a single-source of truth taxonomy that captures Benefits metadata, for use throughout VA.gov. 

VA Benefits taxonomy in the Drupal CMS:  
https://prod.cms.va.gov/admin/structure/taxonomy/manage/va_benefits_taxonomy/overview (Drupal Admin or Content Publisher role required)


## Problem statement
Benefits content is threaded throughout VA.gov, used for multiple purposes. We want a single source of truth for Benefits content, that can be harnessed and used throughout the site for "create once, publish everywhere" (COPE) purposes.
