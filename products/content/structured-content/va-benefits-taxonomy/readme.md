# VA Benefits Taxonomy Product Brief

## Overview
The VA Benefits Taxonomy is a single-source of truth taxonomy that captures Benefits metadata, for use throughout VA.gov. 

VA Benefits taxonomy in the Drupal CMS:  
https://prod.cms.va.gov/admin/structure/taxonomy/manage/va_benefits_taxonomy/overview (Drupal Admin or Content Publisher role required)


## Problem statement
Benefits content is threaded throughout VA.gov, used for multiple purposes. We want a single source of truth for Benefits content, that can be harnessed and used throughout the site for "create once, publish everywhere" (COPE) purposes. 

### User Stories / User Cases
As a Veteran, I want to see consistent terminology and verbiage when reading about benefits so that I'm not confused and clearly understand what my benefits are, what I need to provide, and what paths to take to apply for benefits.

### User pain points and opportunities
Terminology and verbiage that veterans see is not consistent, and they may see different words and phrases used instead of consistent, one-source-of-truth wording which will be easier to understand and follow when learning about or applying for benefits.

### Business pain points and opportunities


## Background
This taxonomy was created in 2023, as part of an effort to harden the content model for Benefit Detail Pages.
* Product documentation: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/products/content/structured-content/benefits-content-model
* epic: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/9628

As of September 2023, the VA Benefits taxonomy is launched to production in the CMS, CAIA has created initial content, but the content of the taxonomy is not exposed to the front-end of VA.gov.
