# VA Benefits Taxonomy Product Brief

## Overview
The VA Benefits Taxonomy is a single-source of truth taxonomy that captures Benefits metadata for use throughout VA.gov. 

VA Benefits taxonomy in the Drupal CMS:  
https://prod.cms.va.gov/admin/structure/taxonomy/manage/va_benefits_taxonomy/overview (Drupal Admin or Content Publisher role required)

## Problem statement
Benefits content is threaded throughout VA.gov and used for multiple purposes. We want a single source of truth for Benefits content that can be harnessed and used throughout the site for "create once, publish everywhere" (COPE) purposes. 

### User Stories / User Cases
As a Veteran, I want to see consistent terminology and verbiage when reading about benefits so that I'm not confused and can clearly understand what my benefits are, what I need to provide to get my benefits, what paths to take to apply for benefits, and where to go to ask questions and get clarification.

### User pain points and opportunities
Terminology and verbiage that veterans see is not consistent. They are confused by seeing different words and phrases used that actually mean the same thing, instead of consistent, one-source-of-truth wording which will be easier to understand and follow when learning about or applying for benefits.

### Business pain points and opportunities


## Background
This taxonomy was created in 2023, as part of an effort to harden the content model for Benefit Detail Pages.
* Product documentation: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/products/content/structured-content/benefits-content-model
* Epic: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/9628

As of September 2023, the VA Benefits taxonomy is launched to production in the CMS. CAIA has created initial content, but the content of the taxonomy is not exposed to the front-end of VA.gov.

## In Scope
### MVP

### üëâüèº Benefit Name / VA Benefit API ID
  * **Requirements**
    * For initial load of the Benefit Name/VA Benefit API ID, auto-populate with camelCase. VA Services taxonomy uses lower camelCase, and we could follow suit here. Before releasing, have Public Websites engineers validate to make sure it makes sense to future developers.
      * Note that we don't have the auto-creation yet.
      * No hard business requirements are known here, so this could be handled in whatever way makes sense to CAIA + engineering.
  * **Tickets**
    * Engineering task ticket: auto-populate the VA Benefit API ID with camelCase of benefitName
      * [[VA Benefits Taxonomy] Auto-populate the VA Benefit API ID with camelCase of benefitsName #18162](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/18162)
            
### üëâüèº How to Apply Section
  * **Requirements**
    * This is for programs like Dental Care, where the Veteran is filling out Form 10-10ez.
      * For programs like dental care, where you apply by filling out the health care Form 10-10EZ (which is the full healthcare form, not just for dental), we understand it might not be obvious to the user/Veteran that they need to fill out the 10-10EZ form for that benefit. For MVP, we will solve this using the text in the How to Apply section.
  * **Tickets**
    * Engineering task ticket: Update the help text in the How to Apply section to help the Veteran understand their choices for applying for benefits. e.g. filling out the health care Form 10-10EZ (which is the full healthcare form, not just for dental), we understand it might not be obvious to the user/Veteran that they need to fill out the 10-10EZ form for that benefit.
        - CAIA to provide the verbiage.
        - [[VA Benefits Taxonomy] Update text in the 'How to Apply' sections with more descriptive verbiage provide by CAIA #18163](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/18163)


       
### üëâüèº Benefit Description
  * **Requirements**
    * Will consist of three (already existing) fields: Longer summary, Brief summary (currently has 500 character limit), & Teaser summary (one to two sentences - currently 300 character limit).
    * Character count limits will be required on all three fields.
     * Longer summary:
       * Character count limit = 500
       * Always required.
     * Brief summary:
       * Character count limit = 300
       * Optional, UNLESS the Longer summary description character count is more than 300 characters. If so, then the Brief summary changes from optional to required.
     * Teaser summary:
       * Character count limit = 200
       * Optional, UNLESS the Brief summary is greater than 200, then the teaser summary is required.
    * In the editorial interface, we want to be sure there is feedback (error message/warning) for the character counts, and in the descriptions we include what the character counts are.
    * Work with CAIA to provide content for the editorial interface for best practices.
      * Note that CAIA will provide editorial context e.g. word counts for the Longer, Brief, and Teaser summary descriptions and helper text.
      * Note from CAIA: We need to think about how much depth we want to go into for the ‚ÄúLonger summary.‚Äù For example, for health care benefit programs, would we include what‚Äôs covered and what‚Äôs not in the full (Longer summary) description? This is something for us (CAIA) to do. We‚Äôll think through this more and document it, but we want to capture it here as part of our overall findings as we began to use this taxonomy.
  * **Tickets**
    * Ticket: Engineering: Set character limits for the Longer summary/brief summary/teaser summary fields.
      * [[VA Benefit Taxonomy] Benefit Description character limits need to be set #18170](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/18170)
    * Ticket: Engineering: 
      * Longer summary is required. If a Longer summary description character count is more than 500 characters, it can't be reused as the Brief Summary, therefore the Brief summary changes from optional to required. If the Brief summary description character count is greater than 300 characters, then the Teaser summary changes to required, unless the Brief summary is less than 300 characters.
 * Notes:
   * this is MVP.
   * in the editorial interface, we want to be sure there is feedback (error message/warning) for the character counts, and in the descriptions we include what the character counts are (there might already be on-screen feedback for character counts).
     - Separate ticket: Work with CAIA to provide content for the editorial interface for best practices. Note that CAIA will provide editorial context e.g. word counts for the Longer, Brief, and Teaser summary descriptions and helper text.
Note from CAIA: We need to think about how much depth we want to go into for the ‚ÄúLonger summary.‚Äù For example, for health care benefit programs, would we include what‚Äôs covered and what‚Äôs not in the full (Longer summary) description? This is something for us (CAIA) to do. We‚Äôll think through this more and document it, but we want to capture it here as part of our overall findings as we began to use this taxonomy.
  * **Product conversation**: Need to talk to CAIA to understand how they want to handle the descriptions above - how to cascade feild requirements the per the info above.
   
### üëâüèº Requirements
    * We want to work with CAIA for what we mean by eligibility vs. the overview sections.
    * The problem can be alleviated with better help text as opposed to drastic content changes.
  * **Task**
    * Fran: We want to work with CAIA for what we mean by eligibility vs. the overview sections. The problem can be alleviated with better help text as opposed to drastic content changes.
  *  **Tickets**
    *  Potential ticket: change help text based on CAIA feedback.
     
### üëâüèº How to Apply
  * **Information**: How to apply might contain multiple steps. Before you apply, while you're applying, after you apply. Wants to normalize the DB to keep the info with what it pertains to.
  * **Requirements**
    * Content modeling needed.
    * Wrestling with part of the How to Apply... pre-flight, in-flight, post-flight.
    * When you're applying for a benefit, you may need to do things before you actually fill out the form.
    * Question: Where does this content live? Does this content live with the form, or with the benefit?
    * Analysis needed in this area. Look through several of the benefits How to Apply sections to see where the info should live. Maybe both?
      * Go through benefits use cases/how to apply. Create a small discovery Spike. Look at 10 - 15 How to Apply content sections to decide where: benefit or form?
    * Wants to normalize the DB to keep the info with what it pertains to.
  * **Decisions Needed:** Dave C and Danielle T.
  * **Tickets**
    * Content Modeling (after decisions are made by Dave C and Danielle T)
    * Spike:  Fran find out who will do the spike; task for Dave/Danielle (and we can provide the data to them)? Analysis needed in this area. Look through several of the benefits How to Apply sections to see where the info should live. Maybe both? Go through benefits use cases/how to apply. Create a small discovery Spike. Look at 10 - 15 How to Apply content sections to decide where: benefit or form?
      * Decisios after Spike:
        * Ticket? Content modeling
        * Ticket? Maybe engineering tasks depending on decision outcome.
        
### üëâüèº Preparing to Apply section
  * **Requirements**
    * There is only one rich text field. We need to move to magic header because, for example, in Aid and Attendance, they need to differentiate between veteran and survivor, so we need to accommodate hierarchy.
    * Note: We can currently make at least one magic head required with more to be able to be created. This is a stand-alone required section currently.
  * **Tickets**
    * Engineering task ticket: Make the existing rich text field into a magic header ... because, for example, in Aid and Attendance, they need to differentiate between veteran and survivor, so we need to accommodate hierarchy.
 
### üëâüèº Intent to File
  * **Requirements**
    * We are trying to say "is intent to file an option for this benefit? yes/no. What additional contextual info for intent to file, and how do they do it. Tackle through rich text? Link to form?
      * Need to figure what data needs to ride along.
      * Start small with rich text field and we can always add additional fields later if we recognize a need.
      * We can add helpt text to inform editors as to what they need or could put in the field (links/words/etc.)
  * **Question**: Are we trying to decide where the info lives - Benefit or form?
  * **Tickets**
    * Ticket - Engineering: Start small with rich text field with help text to guide the editors.   
    - Ticket - UX
    - First Fran - Ask CAIA for help text for the editors.
      * Note: We can always add additional fields later if we recognize a need.
     

### üëâüèº Evidence Needed field
  * * **Requirements**
    * For MVP, we are going to create a limited rich text field for evidence needed.
     * Not required for MVP - Post MVP, the ability to generate a report to collect whatever is in this field so we can analyze it better later for possible transition to a taxonomy in a future iteration.
    * Hypothesis is that the evidence needed for things could be standardized (like DD 214). Would be helpful to have rich text to ensure consistency across all benefits. In the far future, we might already know that we have the Veteran's digital 214, so this is what you need to give to us because we already have everything else.

## Post MVP

### üëâüèº Approval fields
  - Add more backend fields to help us track approvals and audits for this core reusable content. Fields such as ‚ÄúApproving SMEs,‚Äù ‚ÄúDate last reviewed by approving SMEs,‚Äù and ‚ÄúAssociated
 program office(s).  

### üëâüèº Front-end Work
  - Per Dave, work through some POC wireframes for this. For discussion and thought as we map this model to the page templates for core benefit pages. In our pages now, we often have a brief one-liner about a benefit and then a ‚ÄúRead more to learn‚Ä¶‚Äù How will we account for that with reusable content? Perhaps we just allow for page template to have an intro and then we pull in reusable content as needed. 

## Out of Scope
### üëâüèº Exclusionary and Simultaneous Benefits
  - Reason Out of Scope:
    - Re: Simultaneous: there are no known clear cases for this logic. In reality, a Veteran may use the same application to apply for certain benefits (i.e. Healthcare and Dental) but the benefits are not necessarily both granted or may not be granted at the same time. It's more accurate to say, "If you are approved for A, you might also be eligible for [one or more other benefits]; "related" may be a better description than "simultaneous" but not obviously distinct from "co-considered"
    - Re: Exclusionary: Most of the scenarios we considered can be characterized by "know your options" making it more important to surface the possible ramifications of choosing one benefit over another than to enforce logic such as "if A, than not B". T he granularity needed to cover the variations of exclusionary relationships could introduce a risk for editor confusion when choosing between two possible categories. The taxonomy is not expected to determine eligibility at this stage. Because of edge cases and the complexity of the relationships between benefits, we determined that simultaneous and exclusionary benefit relationship categories are not necessary for MVP. These scenarios can be covered by the "co-considered benefits" category for now. The content will be responsible for providing the details, rather than the content model.
