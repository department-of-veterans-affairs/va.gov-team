# VA Benefits Taxonomy Product Brief

## Overview
The VA Benefits Taxonomy is a single-source of truth taxonomy that captures Benefits metadata, for use throughout VA.gov. 

VA Benefits taxonomy in the Drupal CMS:  
https://prod.cms.va.gov/admin/structure/taxonomy/manage/va_benefits_taxonomy/overview (Drupal Admin or Content Publisher role required)


## Problem statement
Benefits content is threaded throughout VA.gov, used for multiple purposes. We want a single source of truth for Benefits content, that can be harnessed and used throughout the site for "create once, publish everywhere" (COPE) purposes. 

### User Stories / User Cases
As a Veteran, I want to see consistent terminology and verbiage when reading about benefits so that I'm not confused and clearly understand what my benefits are, what I need to provide, and what paths to take to apply for benefits.

### User pain points and opportunities
Terminology and verbiage that veterans see is not consistent, and they may see different words and phrases used that actually mean the same thing instead of consistent, one-source-of-truth wording which will be easier to understand and follow when learning about or applying for benefits.

### Business pain points and opportunities


## Background
This taxonomy was created in 2023, as part of an effort to harden the content model for Benefit Detail Pages.
* Product documentation: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/products/content/structured-content/benefits-content-model
* epic: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/9628

As of September 2023, the VA Benefits taxonomy is launched to production in the CMS, CAIA has created initial content, but the content of the taxonomy is not exposed to the front-end of VA.gov.

### Prioritized OKRs for MVP (one objective, 2-3 key results)

### Outstanding questions 

### Solution hypothesis

### Evaluation criteria 

## Project plan

### MVP solution

#### In scope

* **Benefit Name / VA Benefit API ID**
  * For initial load, auto-populate with camelCase. VA Services taxonomy uses lower camelCase, and we could follow suit here. Before releasing, have PW validate to make sure it makes sense to future developers. We don't have the auto-creation yet.
    * No hard business requirements are known here, so this could be handled in whatever way makes sense to CAIA + engineering.
      * 
* **How to Apply Section**
  *  This is for programs like Dental Care, where the Veteran is filling out the 1010ez.
    *  For programs like dental care where you apply by filling out the 10-10EZ health care form (which is the full healthcare form, not just for dental), we understand it might not be obvious to the user/Veteran they need to fill out the 1010EZ form for that benefit. For MVP, we will solve this using the text in the How to Apply section
      *  

* **Exclusionary and Simultaneous Benefits**
  * We will need some Content modeling aroudn this. Might need to pull in Dave Picket?
  * _Exclusionary Benefits:_ Meaning > If you have this benefit you can’t have that benefit
    -  Example: Question is asked of the Veteran: "Add Exclusionary benefits?" Example of options "Housebound **or** Aid & Attendance", etc. Note to Veteran will be something like: "You can have one of these or the other, but not both (if you choose this benefit, you can’t select this linked benefit)."
  - _Simultaneous Benefits:_ Meaning > if you have this benefit, you MUST have this benefit at the same time, _or_ you’re automatically enrolled at the same time.
    -  Example language: Add Simultaneous benefit? Note to Veteran: What we’re talking about here is a benefit that you should or must consider applying for or obtaining at the same time as this benefit.
   
    
* **Benefit Description**
  * Will consist of three (already existing) fields: longer summary, brief summary (currently has 500 character limit), & teaser summary (one to two sentences - currently 300 character limit).
  * Character count limits will be required on all three fields.
    * Long Summary is required. If a Long description character count is more than 500 characters, it can't be reused as the Brief Summary, therefore the Brief summary changes from optional to required. If the Long Description character count is greater than 300 characters, then the teaser summary changes to required, unless the Brief summary is less than 300 characters.  This is MVP.
    * Brief Summary: If this summary is greater than 300 characters, then the teaser summary is required.
  * In editorial interface we want to be sure there is feedback for the character counts, and in the descriptions we include what the character counts are.
  * Work with CAIA to provide content for the editorial interface for best practices.
    * Note that CAIA will provide editorial context – e.g. word counts for a long, brief, and teaser descriptions; helper text for these fields.
    * Note from CAIA: We need to think about how much depth we want to go into for the “longer summary.” For example, for health care benefit programs, would we include what’s covered and what’s not in the full description? This is something for us to do. We’ll think through this more and document it, but we want to capture it here as part of our overall findings as we began to use this taxonomy.
   

* **Benefit Eligibility**
  * We want to work with CAIA for what we mean by eligibility vs. the overview sections.
  * The problem can be alleviated with better help text as opposed to drastic content changes.
 
   
* **How to Apply**
  * Content modeling needed.
  * Wrestling with part of the How to Apply... pre-flight, in-flight, post-flight.
  * When you're applying for a benefit, you may need to do things before you actually fill out the form.
  * Where does this content live? Does this content live with the form, or with the benefit?
  * Analysis needed in this area. Look through several of the benefits How to Apply sections to see where the info should live. Maybe both?
    * Go through benefits use cases/how to apply. Create a small discovery Spike. Look at 10 - 15 How to Apply content sections to decide where: benefit or form?
  * Wants to normalize the DB to keep the info with what it pertains to.
  * Decision makers: Dave C and Danielle T.
 
    
* **Preparing to Apply section**
  * There is only one rich text field. We need to move to magic header because, for example, in Aid and Attendance, they need to differentiate between veteran and survivor, so we need to accommodate hierarchy.
  * Note: We can currently make at least one magic head required with more to be able to be created. This is a stand-alone required section currently.
 
* **Intent to File**
  * We are trying to say "is intent to file an option for this benefit? yes/no. What additional contextual info for intent to file, and how do they do it. Tackle through rich text? Link to form?
    * Need to figure what data needs to ride along.
    * Start small with rich text field and we can always add additional fields later if we recognize a need.
    * We can add helpt text to inform editors as to what they need or could put in the field (links/words/etc.)


* **Evidence Needed field**
  * For MVP, we are going to create a limited rich text field for evidence needed.
   * Not required for MVP.
  * Post MVP, the ability to generate a report to collect whatever is in this field so we can analyze it better later for possible transition to a taxonomy in a future iteration.
  * Hypothesis is that the evidence needed for things could be standardized (like DD 214). Would be helpful to have rich text to ensure consistency across all benefits. In the far future, we might already know that we have the Veteran's digital 214, so this is what you need to give to us because we already have everything else.
 

#### Explicitly out of scope or MVP
* **Benefit Description**
  * Long Description Post-MVP: If a Long description character count is more than the character count of the Brief description, but less than the character count of the Teaser description, the Brief description will then be required.
  * Brief Description Post-MVP: Post-MVP: If a Brief character count is more than the character count of the Teaser description, then the Teaser description will be required.
* **Approval fields**: add more backend fields to help us track approvals and audits for this core reusable content. Fields such as “Approving SMEs,” “Date last reviewed by approving SMEs,” and “Associated
 program office(s).  

* **Front-end Work:** Per Dave, work through some POC wireframes for this. For discussion and thought as we map this model to the page templates for core benefit pages. In our pages now, we often have a brief one-liner about a benefit and then a “Read more to learn…” How will we account for that with reusable content? Perhaps we just allow for page template to have an intro and then we pull in reusable content as needed.
