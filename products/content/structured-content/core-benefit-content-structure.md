# Structured content: Core benefit content

## Long-term goal

Structure core benefit content as individual, centralized fields that content authors can repurpose in various ways across the Veteran benefit content ecosystem.

For example, a facility website, a campaign landing page, the mobile app, or the chat bot can all easily serve up a brief benefit description or list of eligibility requirements or the estimated application review time with a link to more information.

**Note: Teams to discuss what's realistic for near-term goal.**

## Working content fields and categories/relationships

### About the benefit

- **Benefit name (content):** The plain language name of the benefit
- **Full benefit name (content):** Some benefits have both a plain language name and a full VA-program name
- **Benefit acroynm (content):** Some benefits have an acroynm (such as VR&E)
- **Benefit description teaser or "bite" (content):** Very brief (1-2 sentence) description of the benefit.
- **What the benefit offers (summary or "snack") (content):** A brief summary of what the benefit offers. Thinking of this as the high-level "About" content for each benefit.
- **What the benefit offers (full or "meal") (content):** The amount of content will vary between benefits. Some are more straightforward (like disability, where you get monthly payments) while others are much more complex (like health care). Including this as an area of content to think about, but we likely don't want to try to tackle it in depth for an MVP. Refer to the "About the benefit" template for more info.
  - **Benefit rates paid to the beneficiary (content):** Some benefits (such as disability compensation and eligibility compensation) have benefit rates. We likely won't want to try to tackle structuring benefit rates in the near future, as it's complex and different between different benefits. However, we should consider a field for linking to benefit rates to start.
- **Benefit category:** Health, disability, education, careers, burials, housing, pension, life insurance 
- **Benefit type (category):** Money, services, items, etc.
- **Related benefits (category):** Example (Pension - a related benefit is Aid & Attendance)
- **Customer support:** How to get help with the benefit (phone number, etc.). We have this within Resources and Support.

### Benefit eligibility

- **Benefit eligibility teaser or "bite" (content):** Very brief (1-2 sentence), high level description of who can get the benefit. _Not sure if eligibility needs a snack or not - let's discuss._
- **Who can get this benefit: general (category/relationship):** Eligible audiences (ex. Veterans, service members, dependents)
- **Who can get this benefit: Veteran era (category/relationship):** Eligible Veterans (ex. Vietnam era Veterans, Gulf War era Veterans)
- **Benefit eligibility main criteria or "meal" (content):** For each benefit, we have a Veteran-tested pattern for eligibility criteria. This pattern is relatively consistent across benefits, but also has customization depending on the benefit's criteria. We likely want to simply have an open field for this content for now since there is a lot of variation between benefits in terms of requirements and how they're connected. But we can also think about tagging for connecting benefits to different audiences. The eligibility criteria generally address these factors:
  - Service requirements
    - Service type (ex. active duty, active duty for training, combat, etc.)
    - Service duration (ex. "...for at least 90 days..."
    - Service location (ex. "...in Afghanistan...")
    - Service time period (ex. "On or after September 11, 2001...")
    - Discharge status (ex. "You don't have a dishonorable discharge")
      - Note: Here's an example of a reusable single Q&A that we can link to for most/all benefits ("How do I get VA benefits if I have a dishonorable or OTH discharge?")
  - Condition requirements
    - Disability rating (some benefits base eligibility in part on disability rating)
    - Specific condition
      - Presumptive conditions
    - Timing of diagnosis
  - Income requirements (ex. Pension can be income-based, health care priority groups can be based on income limits)
  - Age requirements (ex. Pension for >65; dependents have age limits for education and disability benefits)

### Applying for the benefit

- **How to apply: basic options:** We have a standard pattern for presenting options (online, mail, phone, in person)
- **Benefit online application:** Link to online application
- **Benefit pdf form:** Link to form detail page
- **Supplemental forms:** Some applications require supplemental forms
- **Benefit application review time:** How long VA typically takes to reach a decision
- **Evidence:** Lots of more in-depth info here
- **What to do if you get denied for the benefit:** Appeals process information
