## Signs and symbols

### Dollar sign
- Use the dollar sign instead of spelling out dollars.  
Like this: We’ll pay the tuition and mandatory fees up to $27,120.05 for this academic year (August 1, 2023, to July 31, 2024).
- Add "$" to table cells so it reads the number off as dollars and cents and not a standard decimal.

### Degree symbol
- Like this: The temperature was 5°C

### Percent sign 
- When using percent with a number, use the the percent sign.
Like this: 10% disability rating 

_Notes: This is in the style guide currently_
