As we firm up these patterns, we'll move them to the official style guide.

## Signs and symbols

### Dollar sign
- In general, use the dollar sign instead of spelling out dollars.  
Like this: We’ll pay the tuition and mandatory fees up to $27,120.05 for this academic year (August 1, 2023, to July 31, 2024).
- Add "$" to table cells so it reads the number off as dollars and cents and not a standard decimal.

### Degree symbol
- Like this: The temperature was 5°C

### Percent sign 
- When using percent with a number, use the percent sign.
Like this: 10% disability rating 

*Notes*  
Proposed placement: 
- New H2 under "Abbreviations and acronyms" 
- Add "on this page" component
- Percentage info is already in the style guide under numbers

Status:
- Needs OCTO review

## Quotation marks 
  
### User-submitted text (like search input)
- Use quotations
- It's OK to also bold this type of text in some instances

Example: Showing 1-10 of 110 search results for **"VSO"**

**Note:** Use bold only, no quotations, in references to buttons, screens, or section headers in text.
