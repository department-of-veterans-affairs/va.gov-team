## _THIS DOCUMENT IS IN PROGRESS_

# Goal 
Document general terms in the VA ecosystem and how we're using them. Add definitions to help standardize how we use them. Once we add term to style guide, delete from this document. 

## Word list

| Word or phrase | Notes and examples | Suggested guidance | Status on adding to style guide | Date term added/last updated
| -------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ---------------  | ---------------
| applicant | | | |
| beneficiary               |                 | Avoid using the word beneficiary in a more general context. When possible, use a specific reference like "Veteran" or "family member."||
| claimant               |                 | When possible, name the specific person with the claim, like “Veteran’s spouse or child.” If you need to use claimant to save space, define the term on first instance as “person with the claim.” Like this: “I’m the spouse, dependent, survivor, or caregiver of a Veteran, and I have a VA claim (also called the claimant)." Not this: “I’m a non-Veteran claimant.”||
