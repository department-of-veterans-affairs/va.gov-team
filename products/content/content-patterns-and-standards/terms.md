## _THIS DOCUMENT IS IN PROGRESS_

# Goal 
Document general terms in the VA ecosystem and how we're using them. Add definitions to help standardize how we use them. Once we add the term to the style guide, delete it from this document. 

## Word list

| Word or phrase | Notes and examples | Suggested guidance | Status on adding to style guide | Date term added/last updated
| -------------- | ---------------    | ---------------    | ---------------  | ---------------
| applicant      |                    |                    |                  |
| beneficiary    |                    | Avoid using the word beneficiary in a more general context. When possible, use a specific reference like "Veteran" or "family member."||
| claimant       |                    | When possible, name the specific person with the claim, like “Veteran’s spouse or child.” If you need to use claimant to save space, define the term on first instance as “person with the claim.” Like this: “I’m the spouse, dependent, survivor, or caregiver of a Veteran, and I have a VA claim (also called the claimant)." Not this: “I’m a non-Veteran claimant.”||
| issue          |                    |                    |                 |
| Purple Heart award | Capitalize "Purple Heart."|         |                 |
| recipient      |                    |                    |                 |
| sponsor        |  Q: Do we always waht to use "sponsor" to refer to the Veteran in forms? Even if we don't use this term in the PDF version?                  | Include the word sponsor but lead with the plain language definition. Example: the Veteran you're connected to (called your "sponsor")                   |                 |
