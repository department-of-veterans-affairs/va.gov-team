## _THIS DOCUMENT IS IN PROGRESS_

Goal: To document and standardize words that show up often in forms. 

---   
## A 

### applicant

### A-Number   
The Alien Registration Number is a unique 7, 8, or 9-digit code assigned to every immigrant living in the United States. It may also be labeled as "USCIS#" on a person's permanent resident card. We refer to it as the A-Number on forms.   
#### Example   
Like this: "You must enter either a VA file number or A-Number. Your A-Number may be labeled 'USCIS#' on your permanent resident card."   
#### In use:   
Form 20-10206 FOIA PA Request

## B

### beneficiary
Avoid using the word beneficiary in a more general context. When possible, use a specific reference like "Veteran" or "family member."

--- 
## C   

### claimant   
When possible, name the specific person with the claim, such as "Veteran's spouse" or "Veteran's child." If you need to use claimant for spacing reasons, define the term on the first instance as "person with the claim."   
#### Example   
Like this: "I'm the spouse, dependent, survivor, or caregiver of a Veteran, and I have an existing claim."   
Not this: "I'm a non-Veteran claimant."   

### Contact information   
We use a version of this label when asking for a person's phone or mailing address.  

---
## D   

### Document
We ask users to provide documents, or documentation, as part of their claim or form. In some cases, it might be referred to as evidence. When it comes to the user action, however, we use file rather than document.   
#### Example  
Like this: "[H3] Upload your documents," but the button will say "Upload file."

---
   
## I   

### Identification information   
We use a version of this label with asking for a person's Social Security number, VA file number, or service number.   

---   

## P   

### Personal information   
We use this label when asking for a person's personal information, like name and date of birth.   

### Phone number   
We use "phone number" without a designation, so NOT "home phone number" or "cell phone number."   

### Power of attorney   
Power of attorney is not capitalized.   
#### Example   
Like this: "power of attorney"   
Not this: "Power of Attorney"
