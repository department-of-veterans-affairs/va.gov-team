## 3rd party language

If your digital form allows someone else to sign on behalf of a claimant (alternate signers, authorized representatives), then include this language in the intro. Note that not all forms allow alternate signers, so this language may vary depending on who is permitted to sign for them.

[H3] What to know if you're signing on behalf of someone else

We'll need to have one of these forms showing that you're authorized to sign for the person filing the claim:

- [VA Form 21-0972 (Alternate Signer Certification)](https://www.va.gov/supporting-forms-for-claims/alternate-signer-form-21-0972/)
- [VA Form 21-22 (Appointment of Veterans Service Organization as Claimant's Representative)](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-21-22/)
- [VA Form 21-22a (Appointment of Individual As Claimant's Representative)](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-21-22a/)

Note: If you've already submitted one of these forms, you don't need to do anything else. If you haven't, submit one of these forms before you submit [your application, request, form].
