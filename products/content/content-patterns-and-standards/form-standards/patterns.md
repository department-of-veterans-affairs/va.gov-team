[H3] What to know if you're signing on behalf of someone else

We'll need to have one of these forms showing that you're authorized to sign for the person filing the claim:

- [VA Form 21-0972 (Alternate Signer Certification)](https://www.va.gov/supporting-forms-for-claims/alternate-signer-form-21-0972/)
- [VA Form 21-22 (Appointment of Veterans Service Organization as Claimant's Representative)](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-21-22/)
- [VA Form 21-22a (Appointment of Individual As Claimant's Representative)](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-21-22a/)

Note: If you've already submitted one of these forms, you don't need to do anything else. If you haven't, submit one of these forms before you submit [your application, request, form].
