# Error messages: Access

Appears when the user tries to access an item that’s not available to them. It may be because the record has been deleted, the user doesn’t have access, etc.

## System downtime

Variations in messaging will be contingent on these factors:

- Whether or not the downtime is scheduled/expected
- If scheduled, when the application will be back up (precise time stamp if known, general estimate if not)
- If not expected, general estimate of when the application will be back up
- Application-specific functionality
