# Content guidance on FAQs (Working document)

## Problem and goals
The Resources & Support section of VA.gov relies heavily on Q&As and multiple FAQ pages, especially for reusable content. At this time the Reusable Q&A is the only available reusable content type, currently reusable within Campaign Landing Pages, Benefit Detail Pages, FAQs, & Resources & Support. But FAQs can create UX issues as well as issues with duplicative content (i.e. content framed as a question in one location and a section of content in another location). We want to document guidance for VA.gov content contributors so they can determine when an FAQ may be appropriate (and when another solution may be the answer) and how to structure Q&As and multiple FAQ pages that provide value when appropriate.

## When and how to use FAQs for Veteran- and beneficiary-facing VA content

### Criteria 1: Is the goal of the question to serve Veterans, service members, or family members?

**If yes,** move to criteria 2.

**If no,** this content doesn't warrant an FAQ in Veteran and beneficary-content. This may be content better suited for a press release, congressional report, or other content space.

### Criteria 2: 

It may warrant an FAQ--or a different solution. If the question is promotional or serving the needs of VA rather than our customers, it doesn't belong in Veteran-facing content.
- Is the question broad or generic (i.e. How do I apply for VA disability benefits?): Handle in site content with clearly labeled headers, not FAQ. This content most likely already exists in a benefit hub.
- Does the question address a specific, timely, or transactional need? An FAQ may be an appropriate solution if at least one of these is true:
  - People are asking this question in search engines
  - Contact centers are receiving calls with this question
- Does the question address a question that people may need often or across several tasks (like making debt payments or signing in to VA.gov)? An FAQ may be appropriate if at least one of these is true:
  - The question addresses a common error or pain point related to a task, **or** 
  - People are asking this question in search engines, **or**
  - Contact centers are receiving calls with this question 
 
## When to publish a Reusable Q&A, a multiple FAQ page, or both

- First, check to make sure the question isn't already answered in VA.gov content. 
- Does the question on its own have high search value (threshold?)? If yes, consider publishing this as a Reusable Q&A.
- Are there X (define threshold) or more questions that directly relate to the same topic? If yes, consider including these questions on a multiple FAQs page. (What's our threshold for too many total FAQs on a page?)

## How to structure a Q&A and a multiple FAQ page

- Aim to phrase a Q&A the way that people ask the question in search or in calls to contact centers. 
- Whenever possible, create each Q&A to stand on its own in any context. This will help to make sure that the Q&A can be used not just on an FAQ page or in Resources and Support, but at any point where a person might have this question.
- Be sure the answer directly answers the question and gets to the main point as quickly as possible. If you frame the question up in a way that leads to a "Yes," "No," or "It depends on..." answer, be sure to start the answer with "Yes," No," or "It depends on..." and then go into further details as needed.

## Multiple FAQ page
- Always include a clear, relevant, SEO-optimized H1 that tells people exactly what the FAQs on the page will cover. Make sure all questions on the page map back to the title topic.
- When creating a multiple FAQ page, create clearly labeled sections of relevant FAQs. Follow the same principle as bullet lists, including no more than 7 FAQs in any one FAQ section on the page. This will help to keep the list of FAQs from overwhelming readers.
- Provide just the information the person needs in each FAQ.

## When to pull down an FAQ

- Threshold for when we retire an FAQ or determine that it's not the appropriate solution
  - Timeliness
  - Feedback scores
  - Analytics (pageviews/TOC or accordion clicks, etc.)
