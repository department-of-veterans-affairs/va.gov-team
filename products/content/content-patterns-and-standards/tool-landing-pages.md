# Goal

Define content patterns to inform phase 1 tool landing page refresh updates. We'll then update these elements across all tool landing pages, starting with health tool landing pages.

### H1s

#### Background info

Most of our tool landing page H1s are CTAs. There are a few exceptions (like "VA prescription refill and tracking") due to past SEO-based decisions.  We are moving away from a primarily SEO focus on these pages and toward getting people into the tool as quickly as possible. And we can still achieve SEO goals with variations. We're also working toward greater phrasing consistency throughout the site for cognitive clarity and to prepare for translation.

Recommend moving to all CTAs (ie, change to "Refill and track VA prescriptions") for consistency for now.

**Note:** We are also talking about possibly moving _away_ from CTAs for H1s. But let's make the few stragglers consistent for now, and then tackle that question later.

#### Recommendations

- Use a CTA for tool landing pages for now
- If the tool allows the user to do multiple tasks (like "Add, remove, or change dependents" or "Schedule, request, view, reschedule, or cancel appointments"), use the main action (informed by SEO) + the word "manage" to encompass the additional tasks. For example:
  - Add and manage dependents
  - Schedule and manage VA health appointments

### Intros

#### Background info

Our previous pattern was:
- Primary SEO keyword within first few words of intro
- Brief description of what the user can do with this tool
- End with CTA using "Find out..." (for tool pages specifically, "Find out if you're eligible and how to sign in to begin using this tool")

We've started to move toward a slightly different pattern:
- Primary SEO keyword in intro, but not necessarily in first few words if it causes us to have to lengthen the intro. Our primary goal has shifted from SEO to getting people into the tools and this minor shift shouldn't have a big impact on SEO. 
- For non-tool pages, end with a CTA of "Keep reading to..." We're shifting this to make it slightly more clear that the information is on this page (vs. a more teaser-like tone of "Find out...").
- For tool pages, can consider a 1-line intro that speaks to what the user will do, as we do on our more recent tool landing pages.

#### Recommendations

- Include primary SEO keyword or a variation in the intro
- Keep intro to 1-2 lines, focused on the task (not the tool)
- Where relevant, we can include "online" to differentiate from other ways to do the task.
- Examples:
  - Change your VA direct deposit information for disability compensation, pension benefits, or education benefits online.
  - Schedule, cancel, and manage some VA health appointments online.
  - Check the status of VA debt related to disability compensation, education, or pension benefits. And make payments or request help online.

### How can [this tool] help me [do task]?

The original goal of tool landing pages was primarily SEO and targeted at newer users of the tool. We're shifting toward the goal of getting people into the tool faster. Therefore we don't need to surface this question high up on the page. We can instead either include it beneath the "can I use this tool" info or within accordions.

**Exception:** If we have a page (like "Manage your VA debt") that surfaces a tool but also needs to convey other important information, this can be feature in a brief list beneath the sign-in widget.

**Example:**

<img width="389" alt="VA benefit debt" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62957278/164014211-21d4ff15-bb7e-447a-bb9b-55aedd322a06.PNG">

### Account info for tools

#### Background

Previously, we worked info about needed accounts into the eligibility information. But this is standard info about signing into VA.gov in general and we cover it in the sign-in widget.

#### Recommendation

Remove this information.

### Am I eligible to use this tool?
 
#### Background

Some tools (particularly the health tools) have added eligibility info. Previously, we did a sweep through content to make "eligible" a consistent word choice for anything involving eligibility requirements. But it doesn't quite fit with tools. This used to be "Can I use this tool to [do task]?" which really fits better. However, we also want to revisit the use of questions on some of our pages (such as tool pages). And we've talked about whether we need to refer to online tools as "tools" per se.

#### Recommendations

**You can schedule and manage health appointments online if you meet all of these requirements:**
-  You're enrolled in VA health care, and
-  You're scheduling appointments with a VA health facility that uses online scheduling, and
-  You're registered or you’ve had an appointment at that facility before

### Information displayed as accordions

The VA.gov approach to accordions has shifted over time. There was a time when we didn't want to put text into accordions on pages used primarily for SEO because the thinking was that could hurt SEO. Our goal for these pages has shifted, and thinking around SEO and accordions has also changed. We want to now place more content in accordions on this page to make them more digestible and mobile friendly.

We want to now display only the most critical information on the page (ie, can I use this tool and potentially other key info for specific products). We'll put the rest in accordions.

#### Recommendations

Use this short header for accordions component:

**Questions about [task]**

### Future considerations

What belongs on the tool landing pg. versus in Resources & Support? <br>
What might belong in both places? (need COPE FAQs)
