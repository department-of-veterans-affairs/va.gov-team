## _THIS DOCUMENT IS IN PROGRESS_
Note: CAIA is continuing this work in [this ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/74785) as of March 2024.

# Goal 
Standardize form intro pages, taking into account the VA.gov style, voice, plain language, and accessibility standards. Share the defined content components, labels, and messaging for the intro page with designers so they have specific guidance when working on new forms. 

## Content components

### H1

#### H1 for pages with a wizard

##### Wizard state
Use the plain language CTA for the task. Maximum character count (with spaces) 52 characters.

**Example:**
Apply for VA health care

##### Form page after refresh
Use the plain language CTA followed by the VA Form # in parentheses. Maximum character count (with spaces) = 70 characters.

**Example:**
Apply for VA health care (VA Form 10-10EZ)

#### H1 for pages without a wizard
Use the plain language CTA followed by the VA Form # in parentheses. Maximum character count (with spaces) = 70 characters.

**Example:**
