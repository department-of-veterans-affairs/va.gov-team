# Document purpose

To document the nuances of plain, inclusive, and compassionate language that our content leads use so that other writers and designers can easily follow these patterns. Once refined and agreed upon, we'll determine which guidance to add to the official style guide and which to include as supplemental resources.

## General guide for writers

Ask questions for each piece of content you write:
- Who will read this page?
- What problem brought them to this content?
- What related challenges or stresses might they be dealing with? For example, someone searching for information about a health condition might be waiting for results or have been recently diagnosed with a serious illness. Someone planning a burial has just lost someone.
- What questions might they have? You can use SEO research, VA.gov and Resources and Support search data, and Google's "people also ask" component to get started with this prior to research.
- How do we balance helping the user solve their specific problem as quickly and easily as possible, while still giving the user all the information they need to make informed actions and learn more if they want to go deeper?

## Language to avoid

### Language that uses words that implies a definitive way of how a person will interact with the information or service:

- "View our factsheet (PDF)" > "Download our factsheet (PDF)"
- "View your benefit status" > "Check your benefit status" or "Review your benefit status"
- "See if you're eligible" > "Find out if you're eligible"
- "Watch this video" > "Play this video" ?
- "If you've heard VA has reopened facilities" > "If you've learned that VA has opened facilities"
- "Walk-in care" > "Same-day care" - needs confirmation from health care folks
- "Walk to the entrance" > "Go to the entrance"
- "The email you see here" or "The information you see here" > "This email" or "The information to follow"
-  Links that read "this page" after a descriptive sentence or two "For more information about this benefit, visit [this page] > Update this link to more a descrptive label or to the title of the page we're linking to. 
- "Call this number and press 1" > "Call this number and select 1"

**Note on Choose vs. select:** Use "select" when asking users to pick an item from a list or a set of options. Use choose when making a decision on 1 thing. 

### Language that implies placement/direction on screen

- "The information to the left" (also doesn't take into account mobile responsiveness)
- "The requirements listed below" 

### Idioms (also related to translation-ready content standards)

We generally avoid obvious idioms. But there are many more subtle idioms that we should document as we find/fix them for reference. Check style guide to make sure we explictly advise avoiding idioms.

## Language nuances

### Genuine empathy, not overly friendly, casual, excited, marketing-focused, or excessively formal

These are important distinctions that we should continue to work to clarify for folks.

### Softening language with subtle changes

- "You need to" > "You'll need to"
- "That depends." or "It depends." > "This depends on..."

### Person-first language

We have person-first language documented in our style guide at this time. However, this is an ever-evolving area, with some people preferring identity-first language, especially when they live with a condition that is lifelong and a key part of defining how they move through the world. 

Examples from reading:
 - Many in the Autism community have expressed preferring “Autistic person” or “Autistic individual” over “person with Autism.”
 - Many in the deaf and blind communities have expressed a greater preference for identity-first language as an expression of empowerment.
 - Some people prefer “disabled person” over “person with disabilities.” 

General consensus appears to be that person-first language is still okay as a general approach (and is still best practice in instances such as "person with cancer" rather than "cancer patient"). But we must continue to review and get feedback from people within these communities.

- **Note:** Need to address person-first language that I'm noticing in things like footer links and taxonomy (ie, "homeless Veterans" instead of "Veterans experiencing homelessness" and "Minority Veterans").

### Race and ethnicity

- Need to add notes here from research

### Sexual orientation and gender identity

- Need to add notes here based on research sprint learnings
- Note from LGBT working group: VEO is conducting research with Veterans. Will be changing the current VA language of "LGBT and related identities." Will add update when available.

### Experiencing homelessness

- Shifting to more respectful, compassionate language here. Double checking with SMEs. Have updated in coronavirus FAQs and communicated to some product teams. Would like to update in footer, do a more complete audit for wording, and add to style guide.

### Conditional first

We follow this as a content principle, but I don't know that it actually made it into the first iteration of the style guide. It should be in there.

Put conditional information first—so readers can quickly decide if information is relevant for them.
Ex. “You may qualify for extra benefits if you have dependents.” Becomes “If you have dependents, you may qualify for extra benefits.”

### Contextual links and buttons

- Documenting in separate ticket

### Page titles and H1s

H1
_<_ 52 characters and should clearly describe what the page is about, while incorporating the primary keyword

Page title
H1 + VA.gov

### Consistent language for greater cognitive ease (also ties into translation-ready content effort)

Use the simplest words describe something. Then, stick with that. Don't go back and forth to mix things up. If the page feels too repetitive because you're using the same term or phrase over and over, try to find ways to rework the content so you don't have to keep using that phrase rather than coming up with variations on the term or phrase itself.
