# Voicebot

This document serves as the start of a voicebot section of the VA.gov content style guide. This is a working document and is not meant to be final guidance.

## Introduction and welcome content
-Highlight the service areas the bot can answer (claims status and PACT Act) so users know what topics the bot can handle.
-Explain benefits and advantages of bot interaction so callers understand what they can gain from a conversation with the bot rather than speaking with an agent. Ex: No wait time; quick answers

## Tone and voice notes

### Small phrases that add to a robotic tone with recommended alternatives

- "Such as": Replace with "like"
- "Followed by the pound key": Replace with "Then select pound"

### Ending the conversation

- To avoid an abrupt ending, end each conversation with an invitation to re-engage. For example, the current ending of "The VA thanks you for your service. Goodbye." sounds abrupt and final. Consider instead phrasing like, "I hope you got the information you needed today. Call again to get more help from me or from a VA representative any time."

### Pronouns
-Use "I" when referring to actions performed by the bot (e.g."I'll transfer you now.")
-Use "we" when referencing VA processes, systems and decisions (e.g. "We'll likely backdate your benefits to the date of the bill signing.")
-The voicebot can refer to itself as "voicebot" during instances outside of a user interaction (e.g. "We're working to fix some problems with our voicebot. We're sorry it's not working right now...")

## Technology considerations and limitations
-Voicebot copy doesn't include dash marks (-) since the voice interface pronounces '-' as a word. Therefore, "post-9/11" becomes "post 9/11," "PACT Act-related benefits" becomes "PACT Act related benefits," etc. Also remove '-' from form names.

–A limitation of VUI is varied ability to pay attention to and retain information that is only being heard. Given this, the Voicebot is designed to inform Veterans as efficiently as possible and can't support certain outreach statements which increases information overload. For example, VA.gov summarizes the PACT Act as: "The PACT Act is a new law that expands VA health care and benefits for Veterans exposed to burn pits, Agent Orange, and other toxic substances. The PACT Act adds to the list of health conditions that we assume (or “presume”) are caused by exposure to these substances. This law helps us provide generations of Veterans—and their survivors—with the care and benefits they’ve earned and deserve." For a Voicebot summary of PACT Act, we can remove the last sentence ("This law helps us...") which is outreach in nature rather than informational.

## Plain language

### Use active voice
-"Would you like to be connected now?": Replace with "Would you like me to connect you now?

### Content structure
-Since people are more likely to remember the information they hear last, include main points or takeaways in the last sentence of a bot response.
