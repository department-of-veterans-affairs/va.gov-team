# Creating new content in the VA.gov content ecosystem

Use our content placement criteria to determine if your content belongs in the Veteran benefit content experience. If the content you're evaluating has multiple pieces to it, use the criteria to evaluate each piece of content on its own.

<details>
 <summary>Read an example</summary>
 
 **For example:** If you're evaluating a page that contains eligibility criteria for a VA benefit as well as related questions and answers about eligibility, evaluate the eligibility criteria and each Q&A separately.
 </details>

## Criteria 1: Does your content meet both of these requirements?
- [ ] Content speaks directly to Veterans, service members, or family members, **and**
- [ ] Content directly supports a Veteran, service member, or family member in discovering, applying for, tracking, managing, or using a VA benefit or service

### What do to next based on your answer:

- **If no,** your content doesn't belong in the Veteran benefit experience. Your content may belong somewhere else within the VA content ecosystem. [Go to Content outside the Veteran benefit experience](#content-outside-the-Veteran-benefit-experience) for more information about next steps.
- **If yes,** your content belongs in the Veteran benefit experience. [Go to Criteria for determining placement in the Veteran benefit experience](criteria-for-determining-placement-in-the-veteran-benefit-experience) to use this additional content criteria question to determine if your content's primary home should be a VA.gov benefit hub or the VA.gov Resources and Support section.

## Criteria for determining placement in the Veteran benefit experience

### Criteria 2: Does your content meet both of these requirements?

- [ ] A Veteran, service member, or family member must submit an application to receive the specific benefit that the content supports.

 <summary>Read examples</summary>
 
  - **Example 1:** A Veteran must submit an application to get VA health care. They do not, however, need to submit an application to get mental health care or vision care specifically because those are provided as part of the VA health care medical benefits package. Based on this, you would answer "Yes" for VA health care, but "No" for mental health care or vision care.
  - **Example 2:** A Veteran must submit an application to get Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits. If the Veteran then wants to extend those benefits through the Edith Nourse Rogers STEM Scholarship, they must submit another  application specifically for the scholarship. Based on this, you would answer "Yes" for both content about the Post 9/11 GI Bill benefits and content about the Edith Nourse Rogers STEM Scholarship.
 </details>

**And** content provides an overview with basic, high-level information about one of these topics:
- [ ] What the person gets with the benefit (including current compensation rates), **or**
- [ ] Top-level benefit eligibility, **or**
- [ ] Instructions on how to apply

**Note:** At this time, benefit hubs also include landing pages for authenticated tools that help a Veteran, service member, or family member manage their VA health care, benefits, and personal information. If your content supports a tool directly tied to managing VA health care, benefits, or personal information, contact the VA.gov content team.

  - **Example 1:** You would answer "Yes" for a bulleted list of the different types of evidence a Veteran needs to apply for a benefit. You would answer "No" for detailed information about each of the different types of evidence and how to gather that information.
  - **Example 2:** You would answer "Yes" for a bulleted list of the different types of presumed disabilities that make a Veteran eligible for VA disability compensation. You would answer "No" for detailed information about each type of presumed disability.
  - **Example 3:** You would answer "Yes" for a summary description of what a Veteran receives through a benefit program, such as the Post-9/11 GI Bill. You would answer "No" for detailed information about the many different ways a Veteran can use their Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits.

#### What to do next based on your answer:

- **If yes,** your content's primary home should be in a VA.gov benefit hub. Contact the VA.gov content team.
- **If no,** your content's primary home may be in Resources and Support. Answer the next question to make sure.

### Criteria 3: Does your content meet at least one of these goals?

- [ ] Provides supplemental eligibility, evidence information, or application instructions for a benefit, **or**
- [ ] Explains ways to use a VA benefit,**or**
- [ ] Provides more information about a specific program, service, or sub-benefit that a person can use after they apply for a VA benefit, **or**

- [ ] Provides support for signing into and using VA.gov, **or**
- [ ] Answers a question that Veterans, service members, or family members have about VA benefits and services (based on contact center reports, search data, and user feedback)

#### What to do next based on your answer:

- **If yes,** your content's primary home should be in Resources and Support. Move to **Step 2** in this process.
- **If no,** contact the VA.gov content team to discuss more about where your content should live.
