## Aging Content editor notifications

In response to [VA Directive 6102](https://prod.cms.va.gov/help/va-directive-6102),the Drupal CMS provides a Notifications framework to send notices to editors when content has not been updated within a specific timeframe.
[CMS Notifications product brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/cms/product-outlines/VA-Directive-6102-Notifications.md)

This framework was initially built to notify VAMC editors after 365 days of content being unmodified, limited only to CMS content types. 

### Initiatives
Several initiatives have been carried out / are underway to expand this framework to add capability.
