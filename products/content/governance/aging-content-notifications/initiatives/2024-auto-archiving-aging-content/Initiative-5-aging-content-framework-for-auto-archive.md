# Initiative 5: Aging Content New Framework for Auto-Archiving Content

## Cancelled - Not Implemented per Dave Conlon
### Won't bring the expected value to editors or tangentially to veterans, so this has been cancelled.

## Elevator Statement
Create a way for any content type that's in a published state, and that has an expiration date, to be permanently auto-archived.

## Overview
Content becomes stale and isn't monitored or updated on a regular cadence, allowing many of them to still display after a campaign or event has passed. For our over-arching initiative, we want the ability to auto-archive Full width alerts aka Full-width banners, Home Page Benefit Promo Blocks, and the Home Page News Spotlight Blocks on the content's expiration date (EOD).

As the first part of the over-arching initiative, a new notification [framework](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/governance/aging-content-notifications/initiatives/2024-specify-timeframes/Initiative-1-mvp-aging-content-new-framework.md) has been created for the any content types, wherein specific notification timeframes may be assigned per content type, and emails are sent to editors/authors reminding them to edit and extend display of, or archive their content.

As the final piece of the Aging Content implementation, and to ensure VA.gov provides timely information to Veterans and other users of the site, we want content to be permanently auto-archived on a content's expiration date, if no action has been taken by the editor/author.

## Problem Statement
How might we ensure a better site-user experience by ensuring alignment to our VA.gov style guide. Although editors are encouraged to appropriately use Full-width Banners, the Home Page Benefit Promo Block, and the Home Page News Spotlight Block, they don't always update or archive the content as needed, which results in stale content for Veterans, their caregivers and other users of VA.gov. This erodes confidence in the information and value we provide Veterans and others.

#### Examples of Stale Content
**Stale Banners**
- How Veterans Can Register to Vote
- National Buddy Check Week (for one week in October; still up in late November)
- Recognizing LGBTQ+ Veterans During Pride Month (still up several months after Pride Month)
- It’s Time to “VAX to the MAX!” (outdated)

 **Stale Home Page News Spotlight Block**
 This news block navigates users to an article published in May 2023. An updated news article should have been published by now (Dec 2023).

## Desired User Outcomes
Veterans, their caregivers and other users of VA.gov will see relevant, up-to-date content.

## Undesired User Outcomes
Veterans, their caregivers and other users of VA.gov continue to see outdated, irrelevant information which degrades their confidence in VA.gov as a reliable source for information, forms, etc. and causes frustration.

## Desired Business Outcomes
If Editors don't take action to either extend display of, or archive their content, then when a content's expiration date (EOD) is reached, the content will be permanently auto-archived. Note that notifications to Editors is part of the [MVP Initiative](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/governance/aging-content-notifications/2024-specify-timeframes/Initiative-2-aging-content-type-banner-notifications.md)

## Undesired Business Outcomes
Editors ignore the notification emails, and content they meant to extend is auto-archived and needs to be manually recreated (auto-archiving is permanent).

## Measuring Success
100% of full-width banners, the home page news spotlight block, and the home page benefit promo block which aren't edited to then be extended by an editor and are still 'published' at the end of the content's expiration date are auto-archived, thus ensuring no stale or outdated content is presented to Veterans.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* KPIs TBD. This isn't something we can measure using Google Analytics, and may need to be a periodic manual review of content.

#### Baseline KPI Values
Baseline Values consist of a list of current Full-width banners, as well as the Home Page Benefit Promo block and Home Page News Spotlight block.

For this particular implementation, there isn’t a way to obtain metrics from GA.

### Objectives and Key results (OKRs)

- Objective:
  - Key result: Content editors ensure that relevant, current information is displayed/delivered via Full-width Banners, the Home Page News Spotlight block and the Home Page Benefit Promo block so that Veterans, their caregivers, and other VA.gov users recognize that they should pay attention to the content, and they don't become invisible as stale or irrelavent.

## Assumptions

- Full-width banners are to be used for emergencies or actions a veteran needs to take, generally during the timeframe the banner is published. They should only display for seven (7) days and be auto-archived at the end of Day 7 (the expiration date), if the editor hasn't edited with the intent to 'reset' the 7-day timeframe.
- Home Page Benefit Promo blocks are to be used for promotional information for Veterans. They should only display for thirty (30) days and be auto-archived at the end of Day 30, if the editor hasn't edited with the intent to 'reset' the 30-day timeframe.
- - Home Page News Spotlight blokcs are to be used for news and information relevant to Veterans. They should only display for thirty (30) days and be auto-archived at the end of Day 30, if the editor hasn't edited with the intent to 'reset' the 30-day timeframe.

## In Scope for this Initiative:
Goal: Create a framework or method to auto-archive any content. The implementation should be extendable to any content type, if desired in the future, and will be based on a content's expiration date (EOD).
 
  - Full-width banner: content type has a a 7-day timeframe, and if the content editor hasn't manually archived the content, then at 11:59:59PM (23:59:59) on the expiration date (Day 7 in this scenario) the content will be auto-archived.
    - Note that the if the editor, within the 7 days, edits the content in order to 'reset' the timeline, basically restarting the 7 days,then the auto-archive will look at the 'new' expiration date.
  - Home Page Promo Block:  content type has a a 30-day timeframe, and if the content editor hasn't manually archived the content, then at 11:59:59PM (23:59:59) on on the expiration dats (Day 30 in this scenario) the content will be auto-archived.
    - Note that the if the editor, within the 30 days, edits the content in order to 'reset' the timeline, basically restarting the 30 days, then the auto-archive will look at the 'new' expiration date.
  - Home Page News Block: content type has a a 30-day timeframe, and if the content editor hasn't manually archived the content, then at 11:59:59PM (23:59:59) on the expiration dates (Day 30 in this scenario) the content will be auto-archived.
    - Note that the if the editor, within the 30 days, edits the content in order to 'reset' the timeline, basically restarting the 30 days, then the auto-archive will look at the 'new' expiration date.
