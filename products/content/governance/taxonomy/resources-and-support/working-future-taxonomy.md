*We need criteria for what makes something qualify for a topic tag. For example, we could define based on these types of criteria:
  - Volume of individual R&S pages on a specific broader topic *(i.e., if more than X articles on one topic, create topic tag)*
  - Contact center inquiries on a specific broader topic 
  - Search queries on a specific broader topic

## UI

We want to explore faceted tags. We want people to be able to use the tags to filter results. For example, if I choose "Health care" and "Family members," I want only results that are tagged with both of these, not everything that's tagged as either of these.

## Audience

### Beneficiaries
*Allow multiple choices, but add governance guidelines. Remove the more granular audiences for now to avoid confusion or too restrictive choices as we bring in non-OCTO authors and consider if we want to add those back in later.*
- Veterans
- Service members
- Family members

### Non-beneficiaries (leave as is for now)

## Benefit
*Allow multiple choices, but add governance guidelines. Explore value of keeping primary benefit. Explore not requiring a benefit (for example, you don't need a benefit for VA.gov support or VA profile).*
- Health care    
- Disability compensation
- Education and training
- Careers and employment
- Pension
- Housing assistance
- Life insurance
