## Challenges with existing taxonomy

### Audiences

- Some content may be relevant to both Veterans and family members. Right now, authors must choose one or the author. This risks not surfacing relevant content to an audience.
- Audience tags are not mutually exclusive and mix several different demographics and service information, but you can only choose one.
  - There's a danger in bucketing people by group and serving up a narrow choice of results to those groups. For example, a research readout from the My HealtheVet team showed that LGBTQ+ Veterans did not appreciate when searches/filters for LGBTQ+ Veterans served up only information about issues like gender-affirming surgery. Women, LGBTQ+, Native American Veterans may have some specific needs, but the rest of the information is also relevant to them so we don't want to limit the information they receive.
  - If we do want to have audience tags, we're missing key audiences (Veterans with disabilities, Blind Veterans, Veterans with mental health needs, etc.). This brings up the inherent issue of asking people to classify themselves to get information.
  - We could break out "Service era" as its own category/group, as this is a specific grouping that could potentially have benefit in segmenting results. But it can't be mutually exclusive because it would need to also come up in "All Veterans" results.
- We need to be more clear about how we define "audience" for taxonomy. This doesn't mean that we can't potentially also have audience-related tags as a UI feature. We would then need to make sure that the UI presents the tags in a way that makes it clear that these aren't all of the benefits available for that audience. 
- Some labels don't use inclusive language (i.e. "minority Veterans").
