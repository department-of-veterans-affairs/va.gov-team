- [x] Header levels are hierarchical **Note:** I'm adding a task to our backlog ticket for this page that calls out the same problem that we have on the how to file page--the number of days seems to be an H2, but it's within another H2 section. We need to fix the problem with this component.

## SME review

### Tracking details

- **SME** Name goes here
- **Date response received:** 

### Additional questions to ask SME:
- Are all these claim statuses still correct? (show screen shot of subway map)
- Logic of this sentence in No. 2 in the subway map: "Your claim will move to step 3 if we don't need anymore evidence to support it." This doesn't make sense because No. 3 is about "evidence gathering." I think we could probably just cut that sentence entirely. If we end up reworking the sentence instead, we should lead with the conditional if-statement. 

### Responses

- **Is all information on the page still accurate and timely? (If no, please note issues and we’ll work together to address)**
  - **Response:** yes, still accurate. SME agreed with removing the sentence in No. 2 in the subway map. 
- **Are there any gaps in information that Veterans or other beneficiaries need to know? (If yes, please note and we’ll work together to address)**
  - **Response:** no
- **Are there any potential or known changes in a law, policy, regulation, or program that you think may result in needing to update this information within the next year? (If yes, please note change, related law/policy/regulation/program change, and estimated timing if possible. We’ll reach out to learn more about how we can best support the change.)**
  - **Response:** no
