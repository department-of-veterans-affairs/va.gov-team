### Responses

- **Is all information on the page still accurate and timely? (If no, please note issues and we’ll work together to address)**
  - **Response:**
    - Under "Birth defects linked to Agent Orange" suggest it end with "your child may be eligible for certain benefits." Use of "disability" benefits is restrictive, and the application (21-0304) addresses health coverage, voc rehab and monetary payments.
    - Under "Recovery from surgery or an immobilizing disability (convalescence)" suggest the explanation specify it's regarding a service-connected disability as is done for the auto allowance, time spent in a hospital, etc. 
- **Are there any gaps in information that Veterans or other beneficiaries need to know? (If yes, please note and we’ll work together to address)**
  - **Response:** no. 
- **Are there any potential or known changes in a law, policy, regulation, or program that you think may result in needing to update this information within the next year? (If yes, please note change, related law/policy/regulation/program change, and estimated timing if possible. We’ll reach out to learn more about how we can best support the change.)**
  - **Response:** no.
