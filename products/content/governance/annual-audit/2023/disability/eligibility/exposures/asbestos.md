## SME review

### Tracking details

- **Date response received:** May, 2023

### Question for the SME (when we ask for a review)

None.

### Responses

- **Is all information on the page still accurate and timely? (If no, please note issues and we’ll work together to address)**
  - **Response:**
  The highlighted content below is not unique to asbestos claims. A dishonorable discharge impacts all types of compensation claims. Additionally, the criteria that needs to be met in addition to being exposed to asbestos during military service is that the Veteran now has a disability related to asbestos exposure.
I recommend structuring it like the Agent Orange page:
Both of these must be true:
•	You have a health condition that’s caused by exposure to Agent Orange, and
•	You served in a location that exposed you to Agent Orange

I think it might make more sense to include the character of discharge information on the basic eligibility page or elsewhere and leave the exposure specific pages to focus on the criteria specific to those type of claims.
Am I eligible for VA disability compensation?
•	You may be eligible for disability compensation based on asbestos exposure if you meet both of these requirements.
Both of these must be true:
•	You had contact with asbestos while serving in the military, and
•	You didn’t receive a dishonorable discharge
Note: If you get a disability rating, you may also be eligible for VA health care and other benefits.

- **Are there any gaps in information that Veterans or other beneficiaries need to know? (If yes, please note and we’ll work together to address)**
  - **Response:** no.
- **Are there any potential or known changes in a law, policy, regulation, or program that you think may result in needing to update this information within the next year? (If yes, please note change, related law/policy/regulation/program change, and estimated timing if possible. We’ll reach out to learn more about how we can best support the change.)**
  - **Response:** no.
