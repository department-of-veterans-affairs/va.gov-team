- The intro paragraph has no more than 2 to 4 sentences, is within 200 to 400 characters with spaces, and follows our pattern and style for intros (short sentences, paragraph ends with a CTA, etc.).
- Created a new Q&A to communicate that your rating won't change, just the amount of your monthly compensation payment.

- Created a new Q&A for the example.

- No backlog ticket needed.

### Responses

- **Is all information on the page still accurate and timely? (If no, please note issues and we’ll work together to address)**
  - **Response:**
    - Blue panel should read: "Am I eligible for Individual Employability benefits from VA? You may be eligible for Individual Employability benefits if you meet the requirements listed here:"
    - Suggest removing the note at the bottom of the blue panel.
    - As with other benefits above, a compensation claim filed via 526EZ (or the link to file for disability compensation online) is only required when the Veteran doesn't have the required SC ratings.
    - Suggest reordering page
      - Am I eligible
      - What's an example
      - How to file for IU (21-8940 and 21-4192)
      - Not service-connected? How to file for disability compensation.
- **Are there any gaps in information that Veterans or other beneficiaries need to know? (If yes, please note and we’ll work together to address)**
  - **Response:**
    - Suggest making it clearer that IU only changes the payment amount, not the actual rating %. Veterans with IU often request letters proving a 100% rating for state benefits or local tax purposes and IU payments do not qualify for this. 
- **Are there any potential or known changes in a law, policy, regulation, or program that you think may result in needing to update this information within the next year? (If yes, please note change, related law/policy/regulation/program change, and estimated timing if possible. We’ll reach out to learn more about how we can best support the change.)**
