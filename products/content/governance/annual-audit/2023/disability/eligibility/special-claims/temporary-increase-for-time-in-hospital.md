## Content on page

### OCTO checks, edits, tasks

- The intro paragraph has no more than 2 to 4 sentences, is within 200 to 400 characters with spaces, and follows our pattern and style for intros (short sentences, paragraph ends with a CTA, etc.).
- Removed "Who's covered?" from blue box. 
- Added this Note to the end of the blue box: **Note:** If you get a disability rating, you may also be eligible for VA health care and other benefits.
- Assessed "What kind of disability benefits can I get?" section. Deleted health care since that's not a disability benefit and we now mention it at the end of the blue box. No need for bullets anymore here since there's only one kind of disability benefit mentioned: added compensation. So now there's just a single sentence.
- Deleted horizontal line.
- Changed the H2 from "How do I get these benefits" to "How do I file a claim for compensation?" / added an action link for the CTA and used the label "File for disability compensation online" / used this text for the link under the action link that should point to the How to file page: "Learn about other ways to file a disability compensation claim"
- Relevant terms from page are in content brief.
- Backlog ticket for further review created--to assess whether we should keep the example.
