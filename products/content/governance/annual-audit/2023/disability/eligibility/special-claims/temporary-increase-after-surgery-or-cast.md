## Content on page

### OCTO checks, edits, tasks

- The intro paragraph has no more than 2 to 4 sentences, is within 200 to 400 characters with spaces, and follows our pattern and style for intros (short sentences, paragraph ends with a CTA, etc.).
- Assessed the content in the blue box. Added H3s to help chunk the content for both visual and screen-reader scanning. Also reworked the bulleted lists to eliminate sub-bullets.
- Removed "Who's covered?" section 
- Assessed "What kind of disability benefits can I get?" section. Kept this to call out that the benefit is "added payments" in addition to the regular monthly disability benefit. Removed health care since that's not a disability benefit and we now mention it at the end of the blue box. Also removed "Temporary 100% disability rating since that's not a benefit, but rather the added payments are contingent on this temporary rating.
- Added this Note to the end of the blue box: **Note:** If you get a disability rating, you may also be eligible for VA health care and other benefits.
- Created a new Q&A that comes before "How do I file..." in order to slim down "How do I file" and to specifically call out this detail. We may need to shorten the question, but for now it's "To get added compensation, do I need a temporary disability rating of 100%?"
- Changed the H2 from "How do I get these benefits" to "How do I file a claim for compensation?" / added an action link for the CTA and used the label "File for disability compensation online" / used this text for the link under the action link that should point to the How to file page: "Learn about other ways to file a disability compensation claim"
- Relevant terms from page are in content brief.
- Backlog ticket for further review created--to assess whether we should keep the example.

    - Blue panel should start with: "Am I eligible for a temporary 100% rating from VA? You may be eligible for a temporary 100% rating  if you’ve had surgery or received other treatment at a VA hospital, approved hospital, or outpatient center for a disability related to your military service (called a service-connected disability). "
      - Remove note at the bottom.
    - Under "What kind of disability benefits can I get?" it should read: "You may be able to get a temporary increase in compensation while you recover. The temporary 100% rating may continue for 1 to 3 months—depending on your unique case. You may be able to get an extension for up to 3 more months if your case is severe. Example:..."
