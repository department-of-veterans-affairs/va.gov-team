## Content on page

### OCTO checks, edits, tasks

- The intro paragraph has no more than 2 to 4 sentences, is within 200 to 400 characters with spaces, and follows our pattern and style for intros (short sentences, paragraph ends with a CTA, etc.). 
- Relevant terms from page are in content brief and any relevant backlog work is noted 
- Assessed the content in the blue box. (Keeping eligibility info in blue box.)
- Removed "Who's covered?" section 
- Assessed "What kind of disability benefits can I get?" section (Keep because this is not a monthly payment and we need to make that clear.)
- Add this Note to the end of the blue box: **Note:** If you get a disability rating, you may also be eligible for VA health care and other benefits.
- Changed the H2 from "How do I get these benefits" to "How do I file a claim for compensation?" / added an action link for the CTA and used the label "File for disability compensation online" / used this text for the link under the action link that should point to the How to file page: "Learn about other ways to file a disability compensation claim"
- Raised the visibility of the content about filing your claim and getting VA approval first before buying a vehicle. Created a new Q&A for this.
- Edits and reorganization to clarify that you need to file a claim (526) as well as submitting an additional form.

### Callouts for the SME (when we ask for a review)

- We created a new Q&A to raise the visibility of the guidance around filing a claim and getting VA approval before buying a vehicle or adaptive equipment. The question is: "Can I buy a vehicle or adaptive equipment first, then file my claim?" You'll see on the page that the answer contains the same content currently on the live site.
- We added a link that will take users directly to the online form. In that section, we also presented the information about additional forms in a different way to try to clarify that when you file your 526 claim, you also need to submit additional forms.
