## Content on page

### OCTO checks, edits, tasks

- The intro paragraph has no more than 2 to 4 sentences, is within 200 to 400 characters with spaces, and follows our pattern and style for intros (short sentences, paragraph ends with a CTA, etc.). 
- Relevant terms from page are in content brief and any relevant backlog work is noted 
- Assessed the content in the blue box. (Keeping eligibility info in blue box.)
- Removed "Who's covered?" section 
- Assessed "What kind of disability benefits can I get?" section (Keep because this is not a monthly payment and we need to make that clear.)
- Add this Note to the end of the blue box: **Note:** If you get a disability rating, you may also be eligible for VA health care and other benefits.
- Changed the H2 from "How do I get these benefits" to "How do I file a claim for compensation?" / added an action link for the CTA and used the label "File for disability compensation online" / used this text for the link under the action link that should point to the How to file page: "Learn about other ways to file a disability compensation claim"
- Raised the visibility of the content about filing your claim and getting VA approval first before buying a vehicle. Created a new Q&A for this.
- Edits and reorganization to clarify that you need to file a claim (526) as well as submitting an additional form.

### Callouts for the SME (when we ask for a review)

- We created a new Q&A to raise the visibility of the guidance around filing a claim and getting VA approval before buying a vehicle or adaptive equipment. The question is: "Can I buy a vehicle or adaptive equipment first, then file my claim?" You'll see on the page that the answer contains the same content currently on the live site.
- We added a link that will take users directly to the online form. In that section, we also presented the information about additional forms in a different way to try to clarify that when you file your 526 claim, you also need to submit additional forms.


### Responses

- **Is all information on the page still accurate and timely? (If no, please note issues and we’ll work together to address)**
  - **Response:**
    - Instead of "What kind of disability benefits can I get?" I suggest: "What does this benefit cover?"
    - Missing the phone number. Some pages have it, some don't. Suggest placing it at the bottom of every page for consistency. "For more information, call us at 800-827-1000. We’re here Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. ET."
    - Blue panel should read: "Am I eligible for automobile allowance and/or adaptive equipment benefits from VA? You may be eligible for these benefits if you have a disability that’s related to your service (called a service-connected disability) and that includes at least one of these conditions."
    - Also, suggest removing the note at the bottom of the blue panel as it's irrelevant to a this topic.
    - As suggested above, place "Not service-connected yet? How to file a claim for compensation." and a link to the eligibility page  at the bottom. Immediately preceding that, instructions for 21-4502 and 10-1394  Note: 10-1394 is processed by VHA Prosthetics, just like clothing allowance. A 526EZ (or the link to file for disability compensation online) is not mandatory unless the Veteran is not already rated with a qualifying SC disability. 
- **Are there any gaps in information that Veterans or other beneficiaries need to know? (If yes, please note and we’ll work together to address)**
  - **Response:**
    - If possible, we'd appreciate a FAQ about what happens when the claim is approved and Veteran receives the original form signed by VA. Instructions are on Page 3 of the form but some Veterans don't understand dealers are not required to participate; the dealer submits the form and payment goes to them, not the dealer; some dealers want to hold the vehicle until they receive the payment, etc.
- **Are there any potential or known changes in a law, policy, regulation, or program that you think may result in needing to update this information within the next year? (If yes, please note change, related law/policy/regulation/program change, and estimated timing if possible. We’ll reach out to learn more about how we can best support the change.)**
  - **Response:** no.
