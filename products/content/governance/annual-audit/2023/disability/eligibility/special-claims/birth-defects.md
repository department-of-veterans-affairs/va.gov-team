## Content on page

### OCTO checks, edits, tasks

- The intro paragraph has no more than 2 to 4 sentences, is within 200 to 400 characters with spaces, and follows our pattern and style for intros (short sentences, paragraph ends with a CTA, etc.). **Rewrote this and moved description of spina bifida to the blue box section about spina bifida.**
- Assessed the content in the blue box. (Keeping eligibility info in blue box.)
- Removed "Who's covered?" section 
- Assessed "What kind of benefits can I get?" section (we're not saying "disability benefits" here because we're listing benefits more broadly for this specific audience and situation) **(Keep to emphasize health care and to mention VR&E.)**
- Add this Note to the end of the blue box: **Note:** If you get a disability rating, you may also be eligible for VA health care and other benefits.
- Changed the H2 from "How do I get these benefits" to "How do I file a claim for compensation for my child?" 
- Created a new Q&A to house the evidence info that's already on the page but was buried. 
- Relevant terms from page are in content brief and any relevant backlog work is noted.
- Backlog ticket for further review created if needed.

## SME review

### Question for the SME (when we ask for a review)

- In the "How do I file a claim for compensation for my child?" section, ask whether it's correct that the process is to fill out this one form. In other words, the Veteran doesn't also need to have filled out a 526. I just want to double check this.


### Responses

- **Is all information on the page still accurate and timely? (If no, please note issues and we’ll work together to address)**
  - **Response:**
    - Blue panel should read: "Is my child eligible for benefits from VA?" as the first FAQ correctly identifies health care, comp and VR&E.
    - "How do I file" is missing the fax option Toll Free Fax:  844-531-7818
    - "...please call Veterans Benefits Assistance at 800-827-1000." should read: "...please call us at 800-827-1000."
    - 21-0304 is the correct form for children.
- **Are there any gaps in information that Veterans or other beneficiaries need to know? (If yes, please note and we’ll work together to address)**
  - **Response:** no.
- **Are there any potential or known changes in a law, policy, regulation, or program that you think may result in needing to update this information within the next year? (If yes, please note change, related law/policy/regulation/program change, and estimated timing if possible. We’ll reach out to learn more about how we can best support the change.)**
  - **Response:** no.
