### Responses

- **Is all information on the page still accurate and timely? (If no, please note issues and we’ll work together to address)**

    - I can't speak for VHA, bit I think it would be preferable to link to https://www.va.gov/health-care/about-va-health-benefits/dental-care/ instead of a fact sheet.
- **Are there any gaps in information that Veterans or other beneficiaries need to know? (If yes, please note and we’ll work together to address)**
  - **Response:** 
- **Are there any potential or known changes in a law, policy, regulation, or program that you think may result in needing to update this information within the next year? (If yes, please note change, related law/policy/regulation/program change, and estimated timing if possible. We’ll reach out to learn more about how we can best support the change.)**
