## Content on page

### OCTO checks, edits, tasks

- The intro paragraph has no more than 2 to 4 sentences, is within 200 to 400 characters with spaces, and follows our pattern and style for intros (short sentences, paragraph ends with a CTA, etc.).
- Added a Q&A to communicate that your rating won't change, just the amount of your monthly compensation payment.
- In "How do I get these benefits," added an action link for the CTA and used the label "File for disability compensation online" / used this text for the link under the action link that should point to the How to file page: "Learn about other ways to file a disability compensation claim"
- Added a Q&A "What if I have questions about these benefits?"
- Relevant terms from page are in content brief.
- No backlog ticket needed.

### Responses

- **Is all information on the page still accurate and timely? (If no, please note issues and we’ll work together to address)**
  - **Response:**
    - How do I file - please add fax as an option
- **Are there any gaps in information that Veterans or other beneficiaries need to know? (If yes, please note and we’ll work together to address)**
  - **Response:**
    - "We’ll award any compensation payments in the same way we would if your disability was related to your military service (a service-connected disability)." Could this be made clearer in that, like IU above, it doesn't alter your combined SC rating?
- **Are there any potential or known changes in a law, policy, regulation, or program that you think may result in needing to update this information within the next year? (If yes, please note change, related law/policy/regulation/program change, and estimated timing if possible. We’ll reach out to learn more about how we can best support the change.)**
