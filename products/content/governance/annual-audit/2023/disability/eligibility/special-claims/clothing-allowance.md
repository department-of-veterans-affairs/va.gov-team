## Content on page

### OCTO checks, edits, tasks

- The intro paragraph has no more than 2 to 4 sentences, is within 200 to 400 characters with spaces, and follows our pattern and style for intros (short sentences, paragraph ends with a CTA, etc.). **Rewrote this.**
- Assessed the content in the blue box. **(Keeping eligibility info in blue box.)**
- Removed "Who's covered?" section 
- Assessed "What kind of disability benefits can I get?" section (Keep because this is **not** a standard a monthly payment and we need to make that clear.)
- Add this "Note" to the end of the blue box: **Note:** If you get a disability rating, you may also be eligible for VA health care and other benefits.
- Changed the H2 from "How do I get these benefits" to "How do I file a claim for compensation?" / added an action link for the CTA and used the label "File for disability compensation online" / used this text for the link under the action link that should point to the How to file page: "Learn about other ways to file a disability compensation claim"
- Broke out into its own Q&A info about getting more than 1 payment.
- Edits and reorganization to clarify that you need to file a claim (526) as well as submitting an additional form.
- Relevant terms from page are in content brief and any relevant backlog work is noted.
- Backlog ticket for further review created if needed.

## SME review

### Tracking details

- **SME** Robert M. Eakman
- **Date response received:**

### No callouts for the SME

- No callouts. I'm pulling back from mentioning when we reorganize content if there aren't really substantive changes, but rather we've merely moved content out of one H2 section and created a new Q&A.

### Responses

- **Is all information on the page still accurate and timely? (If no, please note issues and we’ll work together to address)**
  - **Response:**
    - I suggest reordering the page after the blue panel:
      - "What kind of clothing allowance can I get?"
      - "Can I get more than 1 payment?"
      - "How do I file for clothing allowance?" (Language is contradictory- submit this additional form but then says the 10-8678 goes to your local VAMC.)
      - "Not service-connected yet? How to file a claim for compensation." and link to the eligibility page.
        - Filing a 526EZ (or filing for disability compensation online) is not required unless the Veteran does not already have a qualifying SC disability.
    - I feel like repeated references to "disability benefits" and filing for compensation is more prominent on this page than clothing allowance. VA and the public equate "disability benefits" to disability compensation, not ancillary benefits. Eligibility for clothing allowance is determined by VHA (hence the 10-8678 form being submitted to VHA Prosthetics), VBA just handles issuing payments to those found eligible. Instead of "Am I eligible for disability benefits from VA? You may be eligible for disability benefits if you meet both of these requirements." it should read: "Am I eligible for clothing allowance from VA? You may be eligible for a clothing allowance if you meet these requirements."
    - Blue panel eligibility criteria are incomplete. Should read:
      - Your prosthetic or orthopedic device damages your clothes, or
      - Skin medication causes irreparable damage to your outer garments, and
      - You need this device or skin medicine because of an injury or illness related to your military service (called a service-connected condition)
        - Also, suggest removing the note at the bottom of the blue panel as it's irrelevant to a clothing allowance discussion.
  
- **Are there any gaps in information that Veterans or other beneficiaries need to know? (If yes, please note and we’ll work together to address)**
  - **Response:** no.
- **Are there any potential or known changes in a law, policy, regulation, or program that you think may result in needing to update this information within the next year? (If yes, please note change, related law/policy/regulation/program change, and estimated timing if possible. We’ll reach out to learn more about how we can best support the change.)**
  - **Response:** no.
