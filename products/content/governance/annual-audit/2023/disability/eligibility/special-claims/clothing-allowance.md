## Content on page

### OCTO checks, edits, tasks

- The intro paragraph has no more than 2 to 4 sentences, is within 200 to 400 characters with spaces, and follows our pattern and style for intros (short sentences, paragraph ends with a CTA, etc.). **Rewrote this.**
- Assessed the content in the blue box. **(Keeping eligibility info in blue box.)**
- Removed "Who's covered?" section 
- Assessed "What kind of disability benefits can I get?" section (Keep because this is **not** a standard a monthly payment and we need to make that clear.)
- Add this "Note" to the end of the blue box: **Note:** If you get a disability rating, you may also be eligible for VA health care and other benefits.
- Changed the H2 from "How do I get these benefits" to "How do I file a claim for compensation?" / added an action link for the CTA and used the label "File for disability compensation online" / used this text for the link under the action link that should point to the How to file page: "Learn about other ways to file a disability compensation claim"
- Broke out into its own Q&A info about getting more than 1 payment.
- Edits and reorganization to clarify that you need to file a claim (526) as well as submitting an additional form.
- Relevant terms from page are in content brief and any relevant backlog work is noted.
- Backlog ticket for further review created if needed.

### No callouts for the SME

- No callouts. I'm pulling back from mentioning when we reorganize content if there aren't really substantive changes, but rather we've merely moved content out of one H2 section and created a new Q&A.
