## SME review

### Tracking details

- **SME** Matt Eakman
- **Date response received:** 12/6/23

### Questions for SME 
- We don't currently have clothing allowance on this page on the live site, and we think it may have been an oversight. We've added it to this reworked page. We'd like to verify that it makes sense to include it here. 

### Responses

  - **Response:** yes. 
- **Are there any gaps in information that Veterans or other beneficiaries need to know? (If yes, please note and we’ll work together to address)**
