## Content on page

### OCTO checks, edits, tasks
- The intro paragraph has no more than 2 to 4 sentences, is within 200 to 400 characters with spaces, and follows our pattern and style for intros (short sentences, paragraph ends with a CTA, etc.). **Note:** I rewrote this.
- Relevant terms from page are in content brief and any relevant backlog work is noted.
- Assess the content in the blue box. **Note:** I moved all content out of the blue box. There's no need for a blue box on this page at all single we don't talk about eligibility.
- Fixed several lead-ins to bulleted list so they are complete sentences.
- Standardized several H2s to enforce consistency between this page and FDC. 
- Shortened and standardized the "How do I file" content so what's on this page matches FDC page. Both pages currently point the user to the "How to file" page
- Reworked "What evidence will VA gather..." section for better logic grouping things in bulleted lists.

### Copy editor checks, edits, tasks

- The page has no broken links
- Text links have purpose and target
- The content is free of ability-focused language (view, walk, see, hear) Note: We allow "show" and "appear" when talking about evidence related to disability compensation.
