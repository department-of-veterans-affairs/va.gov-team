## Content on page

### OCTO checks, edits, tasks
- The intro paragraph has no more than 2 to 4 sentences, is within 200 to 400 characters with spaces, and follows our pattern and style for intros (short sentences, paragraph ends with a CTA, etc.). Note: I rewrote this.
- Relevant terms from page are in content brief and any relevant backlog work is noted.
- Assess the content in the blue box. Note: I moved all content out of the blue box. There's no need for a blue box on this page at all single we don't talk about eligibility. I also deleted the broad eligibility info in "Can I submit a fully developed claim?"
- Fixed several lead-ins to bulleted list so they are complete sentences.
- Standardized several H2s to enforce consistency between this page and FDC.
- Shortened and standardized the "How do I file" content so what's on this page matches Standard claim page. Both pages currently point the user to the "How to file" page.
- Moved content up from "How do I file" into "When should I turn in my evidence" section for better logic/placement of information in these 2 Q&As.

### Copy editor checks, edits, tasks
- Header levels are hierarchical
- The page has no broken links
- Text links have purpose and target
- The content is free of ability-focused language (view, walk, see, hear) Note: We allow "show" and "appear" when talking about evidence related to disability compensation.

### Responses

- **Is all information on the page still accurate and timely? (If no, please note issues and we’ll work together to address)**
  - **Response:**
  - SME comment: "Under "Are there any risks to using the Fully Developed Claims program?" it states: "Once you start your fully developed claim, you’ll have up to 1 year to complete it. If we approve your claim, you’ll be paid back to the day you started it." As noted above, not sure what this is trying to convey. Maybe an attempt at addressing the ITF date? Once the 526EZ is submitted, NWQ is not going to hold the claim in abeyance for 1 year before making a decision"   We removed the line about having 1 year to submit evidence. We also added a Q&A about intent to file (with the same language that we proposed on the standard claims page).
- **Are there any gaps in information that Veterans or other beneficiaries need to know? (If yes, please note and we’ll work together to address)**
  - **Response:**
- **Are there any potential or known changes in a law, policy, regulation, or program that you think may result in needing to update this information within the next year? (If yes, please note change, related law/policy/regulation/program change, and estimated timing if possible. We’ll reach out to learn more about how we can best support the change.)**
