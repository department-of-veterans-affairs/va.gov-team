## Content on page

### OCTO checks, edits, tasks
- The intro paragraph has no more than 2 to 4 sentences, is within 200 to 400 characters with spaces, and follows our pattern and style for intros (short sentences, paragraph ends with a CTA, etc.). Note: I rewrote this.
- Relevant terms from page are in content brief and any relevant backlog work is noted.
- Assess the content in the blue box. Note: I moved all content out of the blue box. There's no need for a blue box on this page at all single we don't talk about eligibility. I also deleted the broad eligibility info in "Can I submit a fully developed claim?"
- Fixed several lead-ins to bulleted list so they are complete sentences.
- Standardized several H2s to enforce consistency between this page and FDC.
- Shortened and standardized the "How do I file" content so what's on this page matches Standard claim page. Both pages currently point the user to the "How to file" page.
- Moved content up from "How do I file" into "When should I turn in my evidence" section for better logic/placement of information in these 2 Q&As.
