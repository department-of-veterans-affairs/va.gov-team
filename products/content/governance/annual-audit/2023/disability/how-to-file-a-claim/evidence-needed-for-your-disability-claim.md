- Header levels are hierarchical
- The page has no broken links
- Text links have purpose and target (only need target if the link takes the user off VA.gov--subsites don't need target)
- The content is free of ability-focused language (view, walk, see, hear) **Note:** We allow "show" and "appear" when talking about evidence related to disability compensation.
- Relevant terms from page are in content brief and any relevant backlog work is noted
- Blue box with duplicative info to what's in accordions has been removed
- Change pronouns from "VA/we'll" to "you'll" regarding what evidence you'll need

### Responses

- **Is all information on the page still accurate and timely? (If no, please note issues and we’ll work together to address)**
  - **Response:** From SME: "Under "Original claim-the first claim you file for disability benefits" it states: "A current physical or mental disability from a medical professional or layperson (someone who’s not a trained professional)," I'm not certain "layperson" is optimal after discussing a required diagnosis. Layperson is used several times on this page in the same context." (We removed layperson phrase throughout page)
- **Are there any gaps in information that Veterans or other beneficiaries need to know? (If yes, please note and we’ll work together to address)**
  - **Response:** 
- **Are there any potential or known changes in a law, policy, regulation, or program that you think may result in needing to update this information within the next year? (If yes, please note change, related law/policy/regulation/program change, and estimated timing if possible. We’ll reach out to learn more about how we can best support the change.)**
