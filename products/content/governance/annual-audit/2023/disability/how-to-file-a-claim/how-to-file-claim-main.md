## Content on page

- [x] The intro paragraph has no more than 2 to 4 sentences and is within 200 to 400 characters with spaces
- [x] Header levels are hierarchical **Note:** There's an outstanding Drupal problem to solve with the "Number callout" box that uses an H2 for the header (which is the number of days). The problem is that there's a header over that box ("How long does it take VA to make a decision?") that's an H3, so we have an H2 nested under an H3. It's not hierarchical.
- [x] The page has no broken links
- [x] Text links have purpose and target (only need target if the link takes the user off VA.gov--subsites don't need target)
- [x] The content is free of ability-focused language (view, walk, see, hear)
- [ ] Relevant terms from page are in content brief and any relevant backlog work is noted
- [x] Remove "Who's covered?" section (if needed) **n/a**
- [x] Remove "What kind of disability benefits can I get?" section (if needed) **n/a**
- [x] Change header "How do I file my claim?" to "How do I file a claim for compensation?"
- [x] Change content in the above "How do I file...." section to this:
You can file a claim online now. 
[Action link] File for disability compensation online
H3: You can also file for disability compensation in any of these ways
