# VA.gov core benefit and service content audits

## Overview

By law, VA must regularly audit all VA.gov content. The primary requirement of this audit is to make sure that VA.gov content remains timely, accurate, and available to Veterans and other beneficiaries. The Office of the CTO's VA.gov content, accessibility, and information architecture team also uses this opportunity to audit content against current standards to ensure that all content is easy for all Veterans and beneficiaries to find, understand, and use to do the tasks and make the right decisions to fully access and manage their VA benefits.

## Products impacted

### Products covered in this audit

- **VA.gov core benefit and service content:** This content includes all static (or "unauthenticated") content within the VA.gov benefit hubs and resources and support section of VA.gov.

### Products not covered in this audit  

- **Dyanmic content:** At this time, audits of content within applications and tools and content behind sign-in (or "authenticated") content occur through separate processes in coordination with product teams.
- **Local VA.gov content:** This audit does not include any local content, such as content within VA medical center websites.
- **Other content:** This audit does not include any content within any legacy TeamSite pages, customized program office sites, or any WordPress sites (such as news.va.gov or departments.va.gov).

## Desired outcomes

This audit has 4 primary outcomes:

- Ensure timeliness and accuracy of core VA.gov benefit and service content (this includes identifying text that might need clarification and where there may be a gap--or missing information) 
- Ensure that core VA.gov benefit and service content meets our current, basic quality standards for content, accessibility, and information architecture
- Ensure that VA partner offices have the opportunity to identify upcoming changes that may impact core VA.gov benefit and service content in the upcoming year to feed into the broader proactive content planning calendar
- Provide VA partners with a record of annual audits for compliance purposes
  
**Note:** This audit is not meant to lead to major changes in the structure or content of VA.gov. Major initiatives are separate. This audit is purely focused on accuracy and quality of existing content.

## Process and timeline

### Process

The VA.gov content, accessibility, information architecture team (CAIA) leads the auditing work. Each year, the team will work with SMEs across VA to ensure the accuracy of content. In addition, the team will check content against the content QA checklist and will determine a shortlist of current VA.gov content, accessibility, and information architecture standards to check against for the year. This process allows the team to ensure that content keeps up with evolving standards over time.

The team will alert SMEs in advance of the start of the audit and will work with SMEs throughout the audit process. 

The team will set up a publicy accessibile folder structure for records of all audits and will create tickets for any immediate and future updates that come out of the audit.
