# Fry scholarship

## Purpose of the content audit as it relates to legislation
This work is part of the rolling accuracy and content standards audit of our webpages. It's tied to requirements outlined in the **21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act (21st Century IDEA)** from 2018. The Office of Management and Budget issued a memorandum in 2023 with guidance on how agencies should implement the 21st Century IDEA. According to the memorandum, agencies need to review their content regularly "to ensure that outdated, inaccurate, or duplicative information does not negatively impact the public."

**Date updates published to VA.gov:**
## OCTO lead's updates
- Shorten the intro paragraph so that it has no more than 2-4 sentences, is within 200 to 400 characters with spaces, and follows our pattern and style for intros (short sentences, paragraph ends with a CTA, etc.).
- Assess the blue eligibility box: if it has content not related to eligibility, move that content elsewhere.
- Remove the "Who's covered?" section unless there's a strong need to communicate that people other than Veterans get the benefit (spouses, dependents).
- [Add task specific to Education benefits content]
## Copy edit checklist
- Header levels are hierarchical
- The page has no broken links
- Text links that take the user to an external page (not on VA.gov) have purpose and target, in that order ([Request a transfer of benefits through milConnect](https://milconnect.dmdc.osd.mil/milconnect/))
- The content is free of ability-focused language (view, walk, see, hear) **Note:** We allow "show" and "appear" when talking about evidence related to disability compensation.
- Add relevant information to [content brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/content-briefs/education.md).
- Make any relevant edits based on previously audited education pages.

## Flesch-Kincaid grade-level scores (with no prep)  
We calculated the Flesch-Kincaid grade level scores by copy-pasting the text of each page, from the H1 down to the end of the text (just above the "Back to top" jump link), into a Microsoft Word document. We used the automated feature in Word's Editing tab to generate the score.

## Some quotes from the OMB memorandum relevant to the purpose of this audit
- "Poor information quality reduces public trust, introduces confusion that could negatively impact individuals who seek government information and services, and hinders government operations."
- "For agency websites and digital services, content can easily become outdated or abandoned over time without strong internal agency controls to ensure that information is timely and accurate."
