# Content community touch base meetings

This is a monthly meeting for VA.gov team members who are in a writing, editing, content design, content strategy, or content QA role. We’ll start off as monthly and decide as a group if we want to move to twice a month as we go.

We’ll have a fluid agenda, with these primary goals:

•	Share content-specific questions and support
•	Share support for how to advocate for plain language and content design
•	Share new content-specific research insights
•	Conduct deep-dive learning sessions on sections of the VA.gov content style guide
•	Brainstorm around shared content problems
•	Identify opportunities to bring problems or presentations to the broader Monday design/content/research meetings

From time to time, we’ll also welcome in folks from other practice areas for shared information and learning.

**Meeting time:** 4th Monday of every month, from 4 to 5 p.m. ET. 

**Note:** If you or someone on your team is in a content-specific role and you need an invite to this meeting, send a slack to Danielle Thierry.
