## Style guide and design system updates (Megan, Laura, and Danielle)
- Entry for “Armed Forces” and added an entry for “uniformed services.” Had heard confusion about when to use which.
- Update to “Section titles” section. This is a content pattern we got feedback from accessibility on. Currently auditing our static pages for updating this pattern. We’ve been doing this “Option” pattern for a while but the conversation changed and we came back to this decision.
- In the process of updating our labels and error messages; specifically within forms. Currently updating a csv file and it will eventually be easier to update in the style guide. Will be in the Pattern section under content considerations. Will have label, error message, hint text, and where the error message will appear. Collaboration with Matt Dingee and the Design System team. A way to get toward reusable content. Will likely eventually take down the error message dictionary.
- Button labels WIP guidance: Another place in the design system where we realized we need more content guidance than what’s currently provided. Adding more extensive content guidance for button groups that go beyond these default pairs. Example: In terms of use you might need to say “Agree and continue” “Don’t agree and sign out.” If the button does more than one thing it needs to describe everything. This is still in progress.
- Forms content brief: A more general centralized place where we’re collecting gray areas in content guidance specific to digitizing online forms. There is an experimental design process, but this is a place to collect interesting content problems or questions that don’t rise to the level of needing an experimental design right now. If anyone has an interesting form content problem, reach out and we can always add sections. Eventually the guidance might move into the experimental design process and go into the style guide.
- External links: A lot of conversation and historical context we’re gathering. In the process of listening to accessibility say that anytime we open to a new tab it can have an impact that isn’t great. Currently the default on static pages is if you have an external link it will automatically open to a new tab. Revisiting that and changing it on the technical side and revising our guidelines. Also making it clear in the text itself if something opens in a new tab.
- Form intro pages: Updates we’re working on to the form introduction template page in the design system. Currently it has guidance for application and non-application type forms. But our content guidance and approach has shifted. The ticket is where we’re tracking the restructuring of the page to make it easier for forms teams to know which path they want to follow and grab the right standardized content.
- Sign-in widgets: An attempt to build out all the different variations we realized are possible for when someone comes in and they are unauthenticated and need to sign in to use a tool or form or choose to sign in so it will save their info and progress. We need more standardized variations to capture different scenarios. This is in progress but working to finalize. Working really closely with the IAs who are looking across the different form experiences. Some of our partners (MyHealtheVet) have changed different things about sign in over the years that we need to account for. We are getting closer to being able to launch a new campaign around changes to sign-in and what accounts people will use going forward. This will be a continually evolving space over the next year.

## VA.gov content updates (Danielle, Randi)
- New partner request form. A centralized way to have VA partners from NCA, VBA, and VHA request edits and updates to the modernized site.
- Recent VA.gov content updates: PACT Act expansion, request for military service records, future chapter 33 rates pages, sign-n and identity verification content
- Content updates related to content migration (Community care, Foreign Medical Program). This is also bringing new content authors into Drupal to maintain these pages.
- In-progress highlights: health care appeals (bringing new content into decision reviews hub), accredited representatives (supporting content page for new tool that has launched), family member hub (content moving into one hub with a dedicated landing page), migration (education and community care content)

## Multilingual content (Randi)
- What’s been published in the last quarter and what is in progress and coming up next

## Discussion: Content source of truth methods 
Discussion about when each one works best and the different methods people use
- Laura: What they’ve been doing in MyHealthyVet. Previously everything lived in Sharepoint, trying new process for updates in UX of tool, she would work with them immediately when iterating on design or screen and directly edit the text in design files. Figma is then serving as the source of truth for certain phases of the design work. Still working out whether this needs to move back into Sharepoint docs or if Figma can serve as the source of truth. Looking at Figma plug-ins as well.
- Laura hasn’t done direct Figma commenting with SMEs but the team has put the design files in a Mural for them where they’ve been commenting. This might be evolving.
- Misty: Mobile app has struggled with this and how to do it. She frequently edits Figma but then told the source of truth for everything is what is in production. She needs to get engineers to send a screen shot of an error message. She doesn’t have anywhere to go to see source of truth. “Whatever is in our JSON file is the source of truth.” When she’s pushed on using Figma she’s been told it’s too much upkeep for the design team. Not sure what the solution is but it’s been frustrating. So many edge cases.
- Danielle: This is a continual conversation. Wanted to start us off on looking at different places (Github, Figma, etc.).
- Dave: As someone who is designing for a use case where users are entering the content, the things he’s designing for there isn’t a source of truth per se because there will be 1,000 different examples. It gets pretty complex to document the limitations we want to have.
- Danielle: The struggle of what is actually reusable, what are the limitations, how strict we should be is a really complicated space. The Campaign Landing Page is a good example of when we’ve made it really restrictive our editors have a hard time using them or even want to use them. But if we don’t restrict it might not be good for the end user. Appreciates those aspects and struggles. Source of truth when we’re controlling the content and then when we’re controlling the field and others are inputting the content.
- Megan: Been working with the Veteran facing forms team and the way they started working was the content lived in Sharepoint, the Figma file would get updated, and we decided it took a lot of time. A slight change they made was moving the content source of truth into Github. Works for this because the forms weren’t super complicated. Was really nice to have it in Github and make comments and changes in there. From the designer and engineer perspective it made it easier when they were making changes in production.
- Danielle: For PACT Act wizard she started in Github and then moved into Sharepoint because it was so content heavy and we needed so many SMEs with comments and tracked changes.
- If anyone has other comments on the subject add to our Slack channel so we can dive into it for next time.
