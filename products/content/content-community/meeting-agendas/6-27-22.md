# OCTO's VA content community kickoff meeting (6.27.22)

## Agenda

- **Meet your fellow content experts.** Many folks in content-specific roles on VA.gov are on the Sitewide Content and IA team. But not everyone. We'll take a few minutes to introduce ourselves, our backgrounds, and our roles here.
- **Updates from OCTO content.** OCTO content leads will give a brief update on overall OCTO content goals and initiatives:
  - Centralized content team and support across products
  - Expanding the style guide and standards documentation
    - [New "Top 10 VA plain language standards" page added](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/content-principles/plain-language)
    - [Content briefs in progress](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/content/content-briefs)
    - [Evolving content standards documentation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/content/content-patterns-and-standards)
  - Content training beyond OCTO
    - [Content training example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRoMXztTDuw). This is a training that Danielle has given across VHA teams and that we're adding to the Drupal knowledge base. We'll be continuing to create more trainings.
  - Multilingual content update
    - [Preparing content for translation checklist](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content-localization/editorial-resources/preparing-content-for-translation-checklist.md). This is an example of one of the efforts to set the foundation for multilingual content at VA.
  - Reusable content and omnichannel efforts
- **Mural exercise.** Ask Danielle for link.
