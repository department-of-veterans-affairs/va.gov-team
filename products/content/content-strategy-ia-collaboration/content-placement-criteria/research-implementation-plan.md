# Testing and implementation plan: Content placement criteria for Veteran and other beneficiary VA benefit experience

## Goal

Find ways to test content placement criteria while mitigating risk of adverse impacts on Veterans and other beneficiaries. 

## Testing and implementation steps

### Frame the content placement criteria within a clearly documented benefit content creation process
### Gather feedback on the content creation process and placement criteria from VA.gov content authors 
### Use content the creation process and placement criteria with non-OCTO authors in the Resources and Support pilot
### Define implementation and testing plan for using content criteria to optimize benefit hub pages and IA, balancing forward movement and risk

#### Health care (page-level and new content pilot)
The health care hub h
- Pull content that has low visibility at the page level (example: accordions with low click rates) and doesn't meet benefit hub criteria into R&S. Keep crosslinks to information in R&S.
- Use criteria to inform content placement decisions of new community care content.
- Monitor analytics, SEO, and Veteran feedback for 3 months. Monitor crosslinks vs. direct entry to R&S content.

#### Disability (full content and IA pilot)
- Previous research showed that Veterans could navigate from deeper eligibility information within Disability back to the benefit hub.
- Use content placement criteria to move more detailed content and pages within the “eligibility” and “how to apply” sections into Resources and Support (with crosslinks from benefit hubs).
- Monitor analytics, SEO, and Veteran feedback for 3 months.




### Gather user feedback and data on the revised benefit hubs
