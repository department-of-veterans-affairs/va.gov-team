# Problem Brief


### Situation
_Describe the current-state of your problem and the environment in which it exists._

We launched the VA.gov benefit hubs as part of the brand consolitation effort in November of 2018. We structured the content in a hub-and-spoke model, with 3 main categories of content in each benefit hub (Get benefits, Manage benefits, More information and resources). We brought the majority of the content over from Vets.gov and then augmented it with content migrated from legacy TeamSite pages.

In the 3 years since the benefit hubs launched, we have continued to add and modify content and make small, iterative changes. Most of this work is reactive, driven by business line requests for updates, changing laws or policies, and additional products. However, we have not reviewed the overall structure and organization of the content to find ways to continually improve how we meet the needs of Veterans and family members. At the same time, we've built a new section for content (Resources and Support), started building products beyond VA.gov that need to draw from VA.gov content (chatbot, mobile app), and started introducing multilingual content in targeted areas.

We need to revisit our overall content and information architecture to optimize the content for Veterans and family members now and make sure our content has the flexibility to work across channels and languages in the future. 

### Complication(s)
_Describe what’s changed and how it impacts your team._\
_Leverage techniques like 5 Why’s_ 

- **Resources and Support:** We have a Resources and Support section for supporting content, but not a clear vision for what content belongs in the main benefits hubs, what content belongs in Resources and Support, what content doesn't fit in either and may need new potential homes, what should be reusable across benefit hubs, R&S, and beyond, and how the sections work together to support Veterans', service members', and family members' needs.
- **Content migration:** We have more Veteran-facing content to migrate into the modernized experience. We want to have a holistic strategy in place that informs how we migrate that content. 
- **New initiatives:** New initiatives such as "My VA" and the "health apartment" will impact benefit hubs, and we need to make sure our work is aligned with these initiatives.
- **More content channels:** OCTO is creating more channels for content (such as the mobile app and the chatbot). We need to work toward structuring content in a way that it can be stored centrally and used modularly across channels. 
- **Multilingual content:** VA will soon be creating more multilingual content. Increasing the consistency and reusability of content will help VA ensure accuracy, consistency, and sustainability in translation.  

### Question(s)
_What’s the fundamental question you are going  to answer?_ 

**Note:** We are making a decision to focus first on the content that Veterans and family members use to learn about and apply for benefits. We're avoiding the "manage" spoke at this time, as tasks are a different type of content and tied specifically to the authenticated space.

#### Near-term questions

Are there opportunities to optimize the structure and content of the existing benefit hubs to better help Veterans and their family members get and manage their benefits?  
- Can Veterans and family members find the most important content easily?
- Is there any content within the Get benefits section that Veterans and family members aren't using (and if so, why)? Can this content move into R&S?
- Are there opportunities to reduce the cognitive load on benefit hub pages? 

#### Longer-term questions

- How can we further break down and structure content within the benefit hubs to support modular reuse across VA channels?
- How can we better deliver content at the right time and the right place for Veterans and family members (benefit hubs, resources and support, facility websites, auth vs. unauth)?

#### What we're reviewing for:

- Get benefits
  - Performance of core pages for the -pre-application process (about, eligibility and how to apply)
  - Identify patterns/inconsistencies in existing structures and content
  - Understand the conversion funnel
  - High and low performing content - page level and component level
- Manage benefits
  - Identify key tasks
- More resources

### Answer(s)
_How will the problem be solved and what evidence do we have that it will._ 
_How will you know the problem is solved? What data will you look for?_

#### Near-term:
- Evaluate the current structure of each benefit hub and identify inconsistencies
- Review analytics and SEO data to evaluate how pages in the hubs are performing
- Explore and test improvements to the structure and content organization to optimize
- We will have a strategy for delivering content across the main benefit hubs and resources and support section

#### Long-term:
- We will provide initial reusable structure recommendations that will help enable product teams to reuse content from the benefit hubs in the future

## Estimated timing and steps

### Near-term:

1. Share initial findings for benefit content performance: Mid January
2. Define the initial strategic relationship between benefits hubs/R&S/other content areas and initial governance structure + document risks and constraints: Mid-to-late January
3. Start content planning group pilot to migrate targeted health content: Late January (official kickoff; discussions started already) 

### Long-term

1. Create backlog of content/IA improvements for benefit hubs
2. Define information types of modular content
