# Content placement criteria V2 - DRAFT

The content placement criteria is used to determine if content belongs in the Veteran benefit content experience. 
At this time, the options for placement within the Veteran benefit experience include the Veteran benefit hubs (i.e. www.va.gov/health-care) or Resources and support (www.va.gov/resources/).

Content should be evaluated at a granular level - in other words, content that has multiple pieces to it should be broken down and evaluated by each piece of content on its own.

 **For example:** If you're evaluating a page that contains eligibility criteria for a VA benefit as well as related questions and answers about eligibility, evaluate the eligibility criteria and each Q&A separately.

## Criteria 1: Content must meet both of these requirements
- Content speaks directly to Veterans, service members, or family members, **AND** 
- Content directly supports a Veteran, service member, or family member in discovering, applying for, tracking, managing, or using a VA benefit or service

**Does the content meet both of the above criteria?**

- **No, the content does not meet both requirements**
  - The content doesn't belong in the Veteran benefit experience. 

- **Yes, the content meets both requirements** 
  - The content belongs in the Veteran benefit experience. Continue to criteria 2.


## Criteria 2: Content must meet both of these requirements

- A Veteran, service member, or family member must submit an application to receive the specific benefit that the content supports, **AND** 
- The content provides an overview with basic, high-level information about one of these topics:
  - What the person gets with the benefit (including current compensation rates), **OR**
  - Top-level benefit eligibility, **OR**
  - Instructions on how to apply

**Note:** At this time, benefit hubs also include landing pages for authenticated tools that help a Veteran, service member, or family member manage their VA health care, benefits, and personal information. If your content supports a tool directly tied to managing VA health care, benefits, or personal information, contact the VA.gov content team.

  - **Example 1:** A Veteran must submit an application to get VA health care. They do not, however, need to submit an application to get mental health care or vision care specifically because those are provided as part of the VA health care medical benefits package. Based on this, you would answer "Yes" for VA health care, but "No" for mental health care or vision care.
  - **Example 2:** A Veteran must submit an application to get Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits. If the Veteran then wants to extend those benefits through the Edith Nourse Rogers STEM Scholarship, they must submit another  application specifically for the scholarship. Based on this, you would answer "Yes" for both content about the Post 9/11 GI Bill benefits and content about the Edith Nourse Rogers STEM Scholarship.
