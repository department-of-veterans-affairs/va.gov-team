# Defining benefit hub content eligibility criteria

## Problem

- VA.gov researchers report that Veterans in usability testing often remark that the site has too much content
- VA outreach partners have reported needing more streamlined benefit overview > eligibility > apply flows for new applicants
- The initial WBC effort was a first step at consolidating content, with only the benefit hubs as a navigational experience in the modernized VA.gov. As such, the initial IA structure included content that may not directly serve the primary aims of the benefit hubs.
- Without strict eligibility criteria for what content belongs, page  content continues to become denser as requests for more information come in over time.
- VA content needs to become more structured to support expanded create-once-publish-everywhere (COPE) capabilities. But we can't structure content in benefit hubs until we better define it.

## Proposed solution

- Create strict, clear eligibility criteria for benefit hub content, including for what content that is eligible for a unique page within a benefit hub and what content is eligible for a mention or link to more information from within a benefit hub page.
- As a related effort, we will define eligibility criteria for Resources and Support as well as identify other content types that may not be eligible for benefit hubs, Resources and Support, or office content and may require additional strategy efforts. 

## Goals and hypothesis

### User-focused goals
- Veterans, service members, and family members can quickly and easily discover, apply for, track, and manage their VA benefits, **and**
- Veterans, service members, and family members have easy access to all the information they need to apply for VA benefitsâ€”without being overwhelmed

#### User-focused hypothesis

By carefully structuring and crosslinking content within benefit hubs and the new Resources and Support section of VA.gov, we can provide the critical information that Veterans, service members, and caregivers need to quickly and easily discover, apply for, track, and manage their VA benefits while also providing pathways to targeted, supplemental information that empowers them to fully understand and use their VA benefits, programs, and services.

### Team-focused goal
- VA content and IA strategists, content authors, and program partners have clearly documented and specific guidance to empower them to make decisions about where to place benefit-related content and collaborate on the most appropriate solution

#### Team-focused hypothesis

By providing strict, clear eligibility criteria around benefit hub (and other) content, VA teams will be better able to respond to and gain alignment on content/IA requests. 

## Working eligibility criteria for benefit hub content

### General content eligibility criteria for benefit hubs

To belong in a benefit hub  in any form, the content must meet both of these requirements:
- Content speaks directly to Veterans, service members, or family members, **and**
- Content directly supports a VA benefit that a Veteran, service member, or family member must apply to receive

### Content eligibility criteria for a unique benefit hub page

To be eligible for a unique benefit hub page, content must meet at least 1 of these requirements:
- Content provides an overview of a tool needed to manage or use the benefit or service, **or**
- Content  provides an overview of what the person will get with the benefit (including current compensation rates), its eligibility criteria, or instructions on how to apply

**And** the content must support a benefit that meets at least 1 of these requirements: 
- The benefit has a specific application (either a primary benefit application or an additional application), **or**
- The benefit shares an application, but has unique eligibility criteria or a unique application process [TESTING THIS OUT AGAINST CONTENT - NOT CLEAR YET]
