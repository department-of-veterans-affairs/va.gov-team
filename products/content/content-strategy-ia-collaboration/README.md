# Content strategy and IA collaboration

## Background

There are multiple related content strategy and IA efforts in progress at this time. And there is a need to continue moving forward with implementation (i.e., office content migration, non-OCTO author pilot for R&S, etc.). However, there is also a need to continue to build and refine a foundational content and IA strategy for the overall VA content ecosystem that will allow VA to effectively reuse content and provide information to the right person in the right place at the right timeâ€”now and in the future.

Because we must keep moving forward with implementation, we aim to build and refine the overall strategy organically and in parallel while testing hypotheses in small, achievable efforts. We also aim to contiually map these small, achievable efforts back to the growing overall strategy so that teams and partners can remain aligned and can collaborate effectively. We will continue to reevaluate the overall strategy, capture content and IA debt when direction changes, and provide a pathway for understanding the strategy as it evolves.

### Discovery of all potential content types in the VA content ecosystem

This is a working Mural board designed to capture potential content domains in the VA content ecosystem. Are you working on a discovery effort related to VA content? We encourage you to actively participate in this Mural as you go, adding sticky notes based on what you find. We'll regularly review this board and reach out to talk more about discovery findings and progress.

#### Benefits modeling

This is a working Mural board of how we might structure benefit content to prepare for COPE. Feel free to add questions to the Mural.

These 2 Mural boards are for awareness of work happening with VHA.

#### Define benefit hub and R&S eligibility criteria

This is an an effort to move us away from the more amporphous "tier 1, tier 2, tier 3" content type labels and toward a more clear and defined definition of what content belongs in different spaces. We start with the VA.gov benefit hubs. Using our VA.gov eligibility pattern for benefits, we aim to clearly define the criteria for what makes content "eligible" for inclusion in a benefit hub and whether that content warrants its own page or a mention/link within a hub. This will help our VA.gov sitewide content team better respond to requests to add content within the benefit hubs, and will help all VA content strategy and IA partners better align and collaborate on providing an optimal experience for Veterans.
