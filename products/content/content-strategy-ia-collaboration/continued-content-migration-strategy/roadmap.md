## Purpose of migration

Migrating content to modernized VA environments helps ensure that VA web content meets these 21st Century IDEA Act requirements:
- Accessible to people of diverse abilities
- Consistent visual design and agency brand identity
- Content that is authoritative and easy to understand
- Information and services that are discoverable and optimized for search
- User-centered and data-driven design
- Mobile-first design that scales across varying device sizes
- Deduplication of content

Migration also ensures that VA meets the required actions of the 21st Centure IDEA Act:
- Action 2: Identify public-facing websites
- Action 3: Identify top websites
- Action 4: Assess common questions and top content for deduplication and SEO

## Supporting work

The remaining content that must migrate to the modernized VA.gov is highly nuanced, aimed at a mix of audiences, and owned by a wide range of offices across VA. To successfully migrate this content, we need to first establish the following:

- **Need:** Clear content placement criteria based on audiences and content types. This will allow our OCTO team and our partners to align around a shared understanding of where to migrate content in the modernized environment and make faster, more consistent decisions. 
  - **Completed work:** We have established content placement criteria for the benefit hubs vs. resources and support, and a [working process for determining content placement within benefit hubs vs. R&S](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/resources-and-support-author-pilot/process.md)
  - **In-progress work:** We are working on broader content placement criteria in partnership with the web governance board and members across VA. This is a sitewide crew priority for 2024-2025.
- **Need:** Criteria for prioritization of content for migration. This will help guide us in focusing on the most high-value content first.
  - **Completed work:** Refer to prioritization criteria in the following section of this document.
- **Need:** A high-level audit and analysis of websites for consideration. This will give us an understanding of all the content that remains to be migrated so that we can apply our criteria for prioritization. [**21st Century IDEA Act Action 2: Identify public-facing websites**]
  -  **In-progress work:** We have a [broad content audit of VA, VBA, VHA, and NCA sites](https://dvagov-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/danielle_thierry_va_gov/EfbZkH1Kr8BFsXEhb09_Rx4Bhbr9ugKdUxhyh0hyZxBFVg?e=jjgReF). We continue to analyze these sites.
- **Need:** Clear processes, helpful tools, and a shared understanding that allow OCTO and our partners to effectively collaborate during migration and post-migration to maintain high-quality content over the long term.
  - **Completed work:**
    - Completed 2 pilot migrations collaborations with program offices. Applying lessons learned to refine processes for continued migration efforts.
    - Created intake form for program partners.
    - Solidified process for bringing program offices into Drupal and editorial process. 
    - Created standing meetings with administration digital media partners for closer collaboration.
  - **In-progress work:**
      - Broader content design and plain language program development
      - Content community of practice continues to grow
      - Content work tracker for VA program offices to track work
      - AI style guide checker tool

## Criteria for prioritization
- **Audience and content topic:** We have a "home" for benefit and service content for Veterans and other beneficiaries. We will prioritize migrating content that fits this definition to the Drupal environment, using our content placement criteria for the Veteran benefit experience content. While auditing sites/sections, we'll also identify content for other audiences that may either be suited to migrate to the new WordPress VIP space or may need another solution (such as content for health care providers).
- **Engagement and relevancy:** We will prioritize pages and sites with a high level of engagement, based on pageviews, as well as pages and sites that . As part of this, we will prioritize pages specifically called out on the CIO's "top 1,000 urls" list. [**21st Century IDEA Act: Action 3 - Identify top websites; **21st Century IDEA Act:** Action 4: Assess common questions and top content for deduplication and SEO**]
- **Accessibility issues:** We will prioritize pages and sites with known accessibility issues.
- **Level of effort:** We will work to balance between quickly moving forward with pages that require a low level of effort to migrate and continuing to invest time in the full sections, subdomains, and tools that will require a much more significant level of effort.
- **Capacity and commitment of program offices:** We will prioritize based on current capacity of program offices to commit to partner with us on the initial migration of their content and the ongoing collaboration of maintaining that content.
