# Migration process

The purpose of this document is to outline the order of events and the timing of various communication with business lines.

## Steps to migrate content from benefits.va.gov to VA.gov

- OCTO: Set up kick-off meeting with business line stakeholders (**need to add to the deck** a slide about the need to restructure the legacy landing page and left nav links)
- OCTO/CAIA: Hold ongoing meetings with stakeholders to walk through each line of the spreadsheet, ask/answer questions, make placement recommendations, etc.
- CAIA with OCTO guidance: Write new content to place on existing pages or for new R&S articles and review/get approvals from stakeholders
- CAIA: Publish new content
- CAIA: Send email to stakeholders outlining redirects
- OCTO: Follow up with a response to this email to remind stakeholders that with the completion of this hub's content migration, we have recommendations for restructuring the legacy landing page and left nav links
