# Migration process

The purpose of this document is to outline the order of events and the timing of various communication with business lines.

## Steps to migrate content from benefits.va.gov to VA.gov

- OCTO: Set up kick-off meeting with business line stakeholders (**need to add to the deck** a slide about the need to restructure the legacy landing page and left nav links)
- OCTO/CAIA: Hold ongoing meetings with stakeholders to walk through each line of the spreadsheet, ask/answer questions, make placement recommendations, etc.
- CAIA with OCTO guidance: Write new content to place on existing pages or for new R&S articles and review/get approvals from stakeholders
- CAIA: Publish new content
- CAIA: Send email to stakeholders outlining redirects
- OCTO: Follow up with a response to this email to remind stakeholders that with the completion of this hub's content migration, we have recommendations for restructuring the legacy landing page and left nav links

### IA steps
- Participate in kick-off meeting to understand scope of work, timing, and stakeholder relationships
  - Inform stakeholder of IA's role in process:  Establish URLs and entry points for any new benefit hub pages, mapping and validating redirects, and providing recommendations for TeamSite modifications post migration
- Review and understand the audit and content placement decisions
  - Work with content team if there are differing opinions on content placement decisions as they pertain to the benefit hubs
- Map out and document redirects
  - Review with content team, create redirect tickets and manage through process, communicate redirects to stakeholders 
- Audit the legacy site left nav and document recommendations
  -   Document left nav options and indicate which options are moving over to the modernized experience and which are staying
  -   Identify any child pages that are left behind (i.e. sometimes a parent page is migrated but a child page is not - that has to be carefully accounted for in redirects, as well as ensuring that visitors can still navigate to the page)
  -   Draft recommendations for updates to the TeamSite experience
      -   Indicate which navigation options should be eliminated, updated, or newly created
      -   Indicate if new pages should be created
- Send recommendations for TeamSite changes to stakeholders
  - In some cases, a walkthrough with the stakeholder may be necessary
