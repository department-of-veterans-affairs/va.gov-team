## Resources and support

- Improvements to tagging and taxonomy
  - Right now, you can only select 1 audience (Ex. You can't select both "Veteran" and "family member" for something like travel pay that goes across both. You also can't select both "All Veterans" and a specific subgroup of Veterans, such as Vietnam Veterans, which will create overly narrow results for folks.)
  - Review all labels for potential improvements
- Once the tagging is more effective, consider making it visible on the front-end so that people can filter their own results.
