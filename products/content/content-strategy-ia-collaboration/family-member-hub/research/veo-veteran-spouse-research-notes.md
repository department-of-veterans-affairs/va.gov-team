# VEO Veteran Spouse Research

Notes from presentation

- Excluded spouses who were also serving because they would default to a veteran experience, and survivors because their journey is the absence of the veteran through the process
- Text heavy experience for spouses with english as a second language felt va.gov was text heavy
- Spouses were passionate and committed to improving the community around them

## Moments that matter - 4

During duty - constantly adjusting, due to high level of deployments, job changes, etc

Transition - counting down to clocking out; spouses are just as stressed and need support as well, not getting timely info, great reviews on TAP content

Adjusting to civilian life - homecoming hesitancy; the more we can help them to anticipate the better; unknowns included emotional and mental health assistance - help us help them

Adjusting to civilian life - navigating lifestyle changes; spouses provide pivotal role as household mgr, their ability to connect with resources will reduce stress

## Archetypes - 4

x/y axis: Involvement in military community - family or career oriented

Advocates - for family, community, and country; military is family, constantly volunteering and giving back; knowledgeable about resources; many times had to overcome a struggle to get to this

Pathfinders - feet first and fearless, high career, high communal; looking for their own purpose and providing for family; struggling with burnout doing it all; highly engaged with resources; often mentoring another pathfinder; 1 on 1 contribution

Supporter - steadfast companion through thick and thin; always there for service member; everyone else above themselves; low resource engagement, sometimes low knowledge; often new spouses or seasoned but taking step back from personal ambitions to take care of home 

Mavericks - marching to the beat of their own drum; proud of service member but also fiercely independent; have their own communities outside the military structure; communities are important for resource connections and this group is somewhat removed from that; the only one that had strong demographic ties - some feel shoved out of military community, those that don't have kids, career focused, male spouses, those in the LGBTQ community; may engage in resources but moreso for their own ambitions

## Insights

Reconstructing identities - spouses feel like a 3rd wheel to the military which forces them to restructure their own identities and goals; they want to be seen as their own person; each time the system asks for Veteran info (ID) it reinforces that they are not a unique individual and are second 

Recurring churn - change is the only constant in military lifestyle; builds resilience but its hard; gets easier with each repetition but takes its toll; spouses take on stability in the home - managing the house/logistics coordination, also take on mental and emotional well being of the family

Adapting practically - how spouses are contending with this reality; seeking education, entreprenuer, volunteering for personal and financial stability; always weighing trade offs - is it worth it to engage with the resource, sets stage for transition

Transition tension - spouses are used to adapting but transition has unique barriers; are the veterans communicating their expectations and goals at transition; spouses not invited into the transition/tap program to learn; it's online but they don't know that; spouse should have same info and encourage conversation

Community is a resource cornerstone - empathy, comraderie, but also resource connection; not being part of the communities is a barrier whether it's because of how they feel labeled or logistical; sometimes they just throw their issue out to the wind - facebook groups; spouses feel dropped

Perusing resources aplenty - there are hurdles to getting to the resources; too much to sort through and know what applies to you; spouses knew their disability rating but not what it meant to them; they didn't know the caregiver program services; often info is second-hand making it incomplete or incorrect and confusing; misperceptions that spouse is not eligible for resources so they are underutilized and that benefits go away after service

## Areas of opportunity
(didn't capture quant data on site behaviors - i.e. how often are they seeking info for their veteran, or acting as caregive without the title)

Identity and employment - explore how to reinforce their importance, map services with spouses

Outreach and onboarding - proactive outreach, eligibility and enrollment info, tailored content to reach spouses with timely info

Skill building
