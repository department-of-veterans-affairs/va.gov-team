# Research Plan for Sitewide Family and Caregiver benefits hub - 10/2023
*Questions about how to set up your research study? Reach out in the #research-ops Slack channel.* 

## Background

Family and caregiver benefit content, applications, and tasks are distributed across the Veteran benefit hubs. Furthermore, tools related to managing health care and benefits are mostly framed up for the Veteran, but often also intended for family members and caregivers to use for their own benefits. Past research and data shows that family members are going to the hub for their information and communication efforts across VA are aiming to bring family member information (and specifically survivor information) together to help make it easier for family members to understand and access their benefits. In addition, we are looking for ways to streamline the Veteran benefit hubs by simplifying structure and content to improve their experience - moving the family and caregiver content out of those sections would be one way to potentially help that initiative.

We want to evaluate the approach of bringing all family and caregiver core benefit content into the family member hub to determine if it helps improve findability and overall experience for this audience.

### OCTO Priorities 

Which [OCTO priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202023.md) does this research support? 
- Refresh VA.gov homepage and IA

### Veteran Journey
Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)?
Are there moments that matter? 
- This effort is aimed at the family member and caregiver journeys more than the Veteran, but would ideally indirectly improve the Veteran's journey by decluttering their experience. 

**Survivor journey**
- This work supports survivors during moments throughout their journey - from initial caregiving and preparing for end of life, until continuing on after the death of the Veteran in their life. 
  - Preparing
    - Preparing: Caring for their loved one
  - Moments directly after death
    - Adjusting: Loved one passes away
    - Memorializing: Prepares burial and funeral arrangements
  - Applying for and utilizing benefits
    - Engaging: Becomes aware of benfits
    - Engaging: Finds support
    - Applying: Pursues and applies for benefits
    - Applying: Waits for decision
    - Applying: Claim is approved or denied
  - The new normal
    - Continuing: Recognizes their own mental health needs
    - Continuing: Experiences life changing events

**Caregiver journey**
- This work supports caregivers at moments when they are seeking benefits and services to support them.  
  - Becoming aware and adjusting phase: Identifies as a caregiver
  - Shifting priorities and seeking help phase: Contacts support

## Research Goals	

- Determine if moving family and caregiver related content under a single benefit hub for that audience will improve the discoverability and findability of relevant benefit information. 
- Determine if highlighting caregiver and survivor benefits helps improve discoverability and findability of those specific benefits. 

### Outcome
Learnings will help refine how we organize and group information within the new family and caregiver hub. 

### Hypothesis

1. Family members and caregivers will primarily navigate to the family member hub to discover and apply for benefits for themselves
2. Family members and caregivers will primarily navigate to the family member hub to manage and track their own benefits
3. Survivors will primarily navigate to the section labeled "Survivors" to find information on benefits
4. Caregivers will primarily navigate to the section labeled "Caregivers" to find information on benefits

## Methodology	

### IA Tree Test (remote, unmoderated)
Using Optimal Workshop, we will conduct an unmoderated study in which participants are invited by email to participate. After accepting the invitation, participants will be sent a link to a tree test activity that contains XX tasks. For each task, the participant will be asked to locate in the menu tree where they believe a specific task can be completed.

### Location
Data collection will be remote and conducted using Optimal Workshop.

## Recruitment	

OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers. 

### Recruitment approach

We will partner with Perigean to recruit Veteran family members and caregivers. All efforts will be made to recruit a diverse sample, with participants backgrounds ranging across age, abilities, and ethnicities. We will keep track of participant demographic information (identified gender, age, ethnicity, cognitive abilities) and other relevant information in a [folder on the sensitive repo](set up and link). We want to have a meeting with Perigean before recruitment begins to make sure there is no confusion with criteria table and screener questions.


### Recruitment criteria 

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study? 

- Veteran family member - spouse, dependent, parent
- Surviving Veteran family member - surviving spouse, surviving child, surviving parent
- Veteran caregiver - family caregiver, non-family caregiver


**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
Benefit enrollments
- Is enrolled in at least 1 VA benefit 
- Is not enrolled in any VA benefits


## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

**Prepare**
- When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).
- We will finalize the key tasks and test set up on Optimal Workshop by OCTOBER XX, 2023

**Research sessions:**  
- Planned dates of research: 10/XX - 10/XX - or whenever we receive roughtly 40 completed tests
- Participants will be able to complete the online activity anytime after receiving the invitation email
- Reminders will be sent as needed
- Recruiting may continue throughout testing period to ensure we meet minimum participant numbers

**Length of sessions**
- This is an unmoderated online test. Participants are expected to spend 15 - 20 minutes to complete.
