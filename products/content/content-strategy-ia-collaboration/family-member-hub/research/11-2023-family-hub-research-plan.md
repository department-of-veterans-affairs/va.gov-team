# Research Plan for Sitewide Family and Caregiver benefits hub - 11/2023
*Questions about how to set up your research study? Reach out in the #research-ops Slack channel.* 

## Background

Family and caregiver benefit content, applications, and tasks are distributed across the Veteran benefit hubs. Furthermore, tools related to managing health care and benefits are mostly framed up for the Veteran, but often also intended for family members and caregivers to use for their own benefits. Past research and data shows that family members are going to the hub for their information and communication efforts across VA are aiming to bring family member information (and specifically survivor information) together to help make it easier for family members to understand and access their benefits. In addition, we are looking for ways to streamline the Veteran benefit hubs by simplifying structure and content to improve their experience - moving the family and caregiver content out of those sections would be one way to potentially help that initiative.

We want to evaluate the approach of bringing all family and caregiver core benefit content into the family member hub to determine if it helps improve findability and overall experience for this audience.

### Veteran Journey
Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)?
Are there moments that matter? 
- This effort is aimed at the family member and caregiver journeys more than the Veteran, but would ideally indirectly improve the Veteran's journey by decluttering their experience. 

**Survivor journey**
- This work supports survivors during moments throughout their journey - from initial caregiving and preparing for end of life, until continuing on after the death of the Veteran in their life. 
  - Preparing
    - Preparing: Caring for their loved one
  - Moments directly after death
    - Adjusting: Loved one passes away
    - Memorializing: Prepares burial and funeral arrangements
  - Applying for and utilizing benefits
    - Engaging: Becomes aware of benfits
    - Engaging: Finds support
    - Applying: Pursues and applies for benefits
    - Applying: Waits for decision
    - Applying: Claim is approved or denied
  - The new normal
    - Continuing: Recognizes their own mental health needs
    - Continuing: Experiences life changing events

**Caregiver journey**
- This work supports caregivers at moments when they are seeking benefits and services to support them.  
  - Becoming aware and adjusting phase: Identifies as a caregiver
  - Shifting priorities and seeking help phase: Contacts support

## Research Goals	

- Determine if moving family and caregiver related content under a single benefit hub for that audience will improve the discoverability and findability of relevant benefit information. 
- Determine if highlighting caregiver and survivor benefits helps improve discoverability and findability of those specific benefits. 

### Outcome
Learnings will help refine how we organize and group information within the new family and caregiver hub. 

### Hypothesis

1. Family members and caregivers will navigate to the family member hub for information on benefits for themselves
2. Family members and caregivers will navigate to the family member hub to complete tasks related to managing and tracking their own benefits
3. Survivors will navigate to the section labeled "Survivors" in the family member hub to find information on benefits
4. Caregivers will navigate to the section labeled "Caregivers" in the family member hub to find information on benefits

## Methodology	

### IA Tree Test (remote, unmoderated)
Using Optimal Workshop, we will conduct an unmoderated study in which participants are invited by email to participate. After accepting the invitation, participants will be sent a link to a tree test activity that contains XX tasks. For each task, the participant will be asked to locate in the menu tree where they believe a specific task can be completed.
**Test logistics**
- Participant will be required to enter their unique code at the beginning and end of the activity
- Tasks will be randomized to reduce order bias
- Max 10 tasks will included to reduce learning of tree
- Participants will be allowed to skip tasks to reduce forced anwers
- Participants who skip 100% of tasks will be asked to repeat the activity thoroughly before receiving compensation
- Only participants that have a valid code will be compe

**Pre-activity questions**
1. Which option most accurately describes your relationship to the Veteran in your life?
  - Spouse, child, or parent of a living Veteran
  - Surviving spouse, child, or parent of a Veteran
  - Family caregiver of a Veteran
  - Non-family caregiver of a Veteran

**Tasks**
1. You're a family member who takes care of a Veteran full time. You want to apply to get health care for yourself through VA.
2. You are the surviving spouse of a Veteran. You want to find out if you're eligible for monetary benefits from VA. 
3. You are the surviving child of a Veteran whose disability claim VA approved after the Veteran's death. You want to apply to receive the benefits that VA owes for this claim.
4. Your parent is a Veteran who recently transferred their GI Bill benefits to you. You now need to apply to use those benefits to pay for college.
5. You want to know what types of services and support you can get for your own mental health needs as you support the Veteran in your family.
6. You're the family member of a Veteran. You need to download the Veteran's military discharge record, also known as their DD-214. 
7. You drove the Veteran in your family to a VA primary care appointment at VA and want to get paid back for the cost of gas.
8. You are the surviving spouse of a Veteran who receives monthly payments from VA. You want to check the amount of your most recent payments.
9. You're enrolled in a VA health care program that lets you order medications by mail through VA. You want to request a refill for a medication.
10. The Veteran in your life can no longer manage their own finances. They've asked you to find out if you can get approved to manage their VA benefit payments for them. 
 
## Recruitment	

OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers. 

### Recruitment approach

We will partner with Perigean to recruit Veteran family members and caregivers. All efforts will be made to recruit a diverse sample, with participants backgrounds ranging across age, abilities, and ethnicities. We will keep track of participant demographic information (identified gender, age, ethnicity, cognitive abilities) and other relevant information in a [folder on the sensitive repo](set up and link). We want to have a meeting with Perigean before recruitment begins to make sure there is no confusion with criteria table and screener questions.

Will recruit 6 cohorts of 9 for a total of 54 recruits.  The goal will be to reach at least 40 completes.  The test will remain open for at least 2-3 days after the last invite goes out to give all invited participants a chance to complete the activity. 

### Recruitment criteria 

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study? 

- Veteran family member - spouse, dependent, parent
- Surviving Veteran family member - surviving spouse, surviving child, surviving parent
- Veteran caregiver - family caregiver, non-family caregiver


**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
Benefit enrollments
- Is enrolled in at least 1 VA benefit 
- Is not enrolled in any VA benefits


### Proposed cohorts
- Cohort 1 - Family member + enrolled in at least 1 VA benefit + Female
- Cohort 2 - Family member + not enrolledin any VA benefits + Female
- Cohort 3 - Family member + Male
- Cohort 4 - Caregiver + enrolled in at least 1 VA benefit + Female
- Cohort 5 - Caregiver + not enrolledin any VA benefits + Female
- Cohort 6 - Caregiver + Male

## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

**Prepare**
- When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).
- We will finalize the key tasks and test set up on Optimal Workshop by OCTOBER XX, 2023

**Research sessions:**  
- Planned dates of research: 11/8/23 start until whenever we receive roughly 40 completed tests
- Participants will be able to complete the online activity anytime after receiving the invitation email
- Reminders will be sent as needed
- Recruiting may continue throughout testing period to ensure we meet minimum participant numbers

**Length of sessions**
- This is an unmoderated online test. Participants are expected to spend 15 - 20 minutes to complete.
