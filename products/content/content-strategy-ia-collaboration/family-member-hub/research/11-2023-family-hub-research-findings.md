## Research Goals

- Determine if moving family and caregiver related content under a single benefit hub for that audience will improve the discoverability and findability of relevant benefit information.
- Determine if highlighting caregiver and survivor benefits helps improve discoverability and findability of those specific benefits.


## Methodology 

**IA Tree Test (remote, unmoderated)**
Using Optimal Workshop, we will conduct an unmoderated study in which participants are invited by email to participate. After accepting the invitation, participants will be sent a link to a tree test activity that contains XX tasks. For each task, the participant will be asked to locate in the menu tree where they believe a specific task can be completed. Test logistics



## Hypotheses and Conclusions

**1. Family members and caregivers will navigate to the family member hub for information on benefits for themselves**
  - _Definitely true._  - Participants looked within the family member hub significantly more than the Veteran benefit hubs in 4 of the 5 related tasks

**2. Family members and caregivers will navigate to the family member hub to complete tasks related to managing and tracking their own benefits**
  - _Likely true._  - Participants looked within the family member hub slightly more than the Veteran benefit hubs 2 of the 3 related tasks, and significantly less for 1 task
    
**3. Survivors will navigate to the section labeled "Survivors" in the family member hub to find information on benefits**
  - _Likely true._ - Participants looked within the surivors section of the family member more often than the Veteran benefit hubs in 2 of the 3 related tasks

**4. Caregivers will navigate to the section labeled "Caregivers" in the family member hub to find information on benefits**
  - _Maybe true._  - Participants looked within the caregiver section of the family member hub slightly more than the Veteran benefit hub in the 1 related tasks. Marking as "maybe true" given there was only 1 task. 


## Key Findings

1. Participants primarily navigated to and selected answers in the family member hub when looking for benefits for themselves
2. Participants utilized the family member hub for tasks related to managing their benefits, but not consistently or with high success
3. The survivor and caregiver specific sections were a common destination for tasks related to getting benefits for those sub-audiences
4. The “common tasks” section of the family member hub was rarely utilized
5. Participants struggled with the accrued benefits and fiduciary tasks

**Finding 1: Participants primarily navigated to and selected answers in the family member hub when looking for benefits for themselves**

Labels: label 1, label 2 
_List all labels that apply to this finding from the [research repository label list](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/labels?page=1&sort=name-asc)._

- Participants navigated directly to the family member hub almost twice as often (59%) as the Veteran benefit hub (30%) in 4 out of 5 tasks related to getting benefits for themselves
- Participants selected responses in the family member hub 62% of the time, veresus selecting answers in a Veteran benefit hub 27% of the time.
- Participants that selected answers in the Veteran benefit hubs, were often incorrect (76% of the time) – they often selected content specific to Veterans rather than family members.
- The only exception to these results was the task for applying for transferred GI Bill benefits - for this task, participants navigated to the Veteran education benefits hub twice as often.  In addition, once in the Veteran education benefits hub, very few participants found the correct answer and instead selected an incorrect response 81% of the time
- These results echo similar results found in last year's tree tests focused on health care where.  In all 3 of those tests with family and caregivers, participants directly navigated to the family member hub more often than the health care hub as well.
- Tasks included: health care, transferred GI bill benefits, mental health care, survivor compensation, and accrued benefits

**Finding 2: Participants utilized the family member hub for tasks related to managing their benefits, but not consistently or with high success**

Labels: label 1, label 2 
_List all labels that apply to this finding from the [research repository label list](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/labels?page=1&sort=name-asc)._

- Participants navigated directly to the family member hub and Veteran benefit hub somewhat equally for 2 of the 3 tasks 
- Those that visited the family hub rarely got the answer correct – only 7% of the time – compared to 48% correct answers within the Veteran benefit hub
- For payment history, the most common destination and selections were in the survivor section, which was considered incorrect in this test
- For travel pay, 15% went directly to the service member hub, 26% visited it at some point, and 12% selected an answer there
- For the task related to refilling a prescription, almost all participants completed this task within the health care benefit hub. 
- Tasks included: payment history, travel pay, and prescriptions

**Finding 3: The survivor and caregiver specific sections were a common destination for tasks related to getting benefits for those sub-audiences**

Labels: label 1, label 2 
_List all labels that apply to this finding from the [research repository label list](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/labels?page=1&sort=name-asc)._

- Although there was some drop-off in those that navigated from the family hub to the survivor or caregiver sections, those sections were still more often directly navigated to than the Veteran benefit hubs for tasks specific to those sub-audiences
- This was true for tasks related to getting benefits for themselves, but not for the one task related to managing their benefits (view payment history)
- Participants that navigated to those specific sections were highly likely to select an answer there, and were correct more often than when they selected answers in other areas
- Tasks included: survivor compensation, accrued benefits, payment history

**Finding 4: The “common tasks” section of the family member hub was rarely utilized**

Labels: label 1, label 2 
_List all labels that apply to this finding from the [research repository label list](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/labels?page=1&sort=name-asc)._

- Despite being higher up in the tree compared to similar options in family member hub, participants only navigated to the “common tasks” section 7% of the time for tasks related to managing benefits or supporting Veterans (4 tasks)
- It was most viewed for the fiduciary task (15%), which didn’t have a correct answer in that location
- 12% of the participants looked in this section for the travel pay tasks, and all of them ultimately selected the correct answer there (all indirect responses)

**Finding 5: Participants struggled with the accrued benefits and fiduciary tasks**

- For accrued benefits, 32% of the answers selected in the family member hub were incorrect answers that were right next to (siblings of) the correct option labeled “Accrued benefits”. This likely indicates that the participants do not understand the terminology
- For fiduciary information, 34% of the participants went directly to the service member hub, however, all but 1 of the participants immediately backed out of it
- The top answers for the fiduciary task were Family hub > Become a fiduciary (29%), Disability > Change direct deposit (10%), and Disability > Get help from an accredited rep (7%)
- Neither of these topics fit into a single existing benefit category, adding to the challenge of placement and findability

## Additional Insights

1. Health care task
  - This task had similar success and directness as the health care tree test done with family and caregivers in 2023, despite requiring additional clicks
    - In the 2024 test, the task was worded more towards being a caregiver, and the top answer was the PCAFC program selected in the family member hub (32%), the health care option was second (20%)
    - In the 2023 test (CB), the task was worded as a spouse or caregiver, and the top answer was the health care option within the family member hub (50%)
    - In 2024, the options in the family member hub required 1-2 more clicks to get to the same answer compared to the structure tested in 2023
      - 2024: 4 clicks to select PCAFC, 5 clicks to select health and disability programs
      - 2023: 3 clicks to select PCAFC, 3 clicks to select health care
    - Labeling in the 2024 version was also longer
      - Family and caregiver benefits > All benefits for spouses, children, and parents > Health care and disabilities > Family and caregiver health and disability programs
      - Family member benefits > Health care
   
2. Mental health care task was significantly more successful (78%) compared to the baseline caregiver test (37%)
  - In 2024, selections were most often made within the family member hub (68%), compared to the health care hub (4%)
  - In 2023 (CB), selections were most often made in the health care hub (30%), compared to the family member hub (2%) 
  - This shift could be related to
    - the change in the label of the family member hub from "Family member benefits" to "Family and caregiver benefits"
    - the task verbiage with added "as you support the Veteran in your family" making the task sound more related to caregiver support.  The 2024 test saw more selections made for the caregiver programs (12%) compared to 2023 (3%)
    - Mental health option in the health care hub was under more resources rather than within the get benefits section

3. Transferred GI Bill benefits - 32% task success, 78% directness
  - Initial path: Education (56%), Family member hub (27%)
  - Selections: Education (66%), FAmily member hub (24%)
  - Although the majority of participants navigated to and selected answers in the Education benefits hub, only 12% selectedt the correct answer there; 29% selected options for Veterans to apply for GI Bill benefits, and 12% selected the task intended for Veterans to transfer their benefits - this option would provide instructions and crosslinking to the content specific to the family member.
  - This is a complicated task if you are not familiar with education benefits for dependents - it requires the Veteran to first transfer the benefits to you and then you need to apply for those transferred benefits
  - When participants went to the family member hub, most of them were able to find the correct option

4. Travel pay task had similar task succes rate
  - In both the current and the 2023 CB study, participants primarily selected answers under "Manage benefits" within the health care hub
  - In the 2024 study, participants navigated directly to the family member hub 46% of the time, and the health care hub 27% of the time
  - In the CB study, participants navigated directly to the family member hub only 10% of the time, and the health care hub 47% of the time
  - Hypothesis??? Why did the results flip between the baseline study and the current study?

5. Payment history - 42% success, 68% directness
  - Initial path: Family member hub (46%), Disability (12%), PEnsion (17%)
  - Selections: Family member hub (54%), Disability (17%), Pension (17%)
  - 32% went directly to the Family member hub survivor-specfic benefits section, and most then selected either the survivors pension program or DIC - these pages would likely have cross-links to the payments, but their primary focus is on the benefit itself, not the payments you are already receiving
  - 17% selected accrued benefits
 
6. Accrued benefits - 22% success, 73% directness
  - Initial path:  Disability hub (20%), Family member hub (56%)
  - Selections: Disability hub (22%), Family hub (61%)
  - Task specifically mentioned a disability claim and visitors still predominantly navigated to the family member hub and selected answers there
  - Once in the family member hub, 37% of the answers were incorrect siblings of accrued benefits, possibly indicating a lack of familiarity with this service and/or the label
  - This task is clearly challenging to complete; further assessment is needed to understand how well this service and name is known to veterans and family members
 
7. Fiduciary benefits - 29% success, 29% directness
  - Initial path: Disability (22%), family member hub (20%), pension hub (12%), service member hub (34%)
  - Selections: Disability (27%), family member hub (44%), pension hub (15%), service member hub (5%)
  - Top answerS: Become a fiduciary (29%), Disability > Change direct deposit (10%), Disability > Get help from an accredited rep (7%)
  - All but one person who navigated directly to the service member hub immediately backed out of it, most often choosing the family hub next
  - This task is clearly challenging to complete; further assessment is needed to understand how well this service and name is known to veterans and family members
