## Research Goals

- Determine if moving family and caregiver related content under a single benefit hub for that audience will improve the discoverability and findability of relevant benefit information.
- Determine if highlighting caregiver and survivor benefits helps improve discoverability and findability of those specific benefits.

**Hypotheses**



## Methodology 

**IA Tree Test (remote, unmoderated)**
Using Optimal Workshop, we will conduct an unmoderated study in which participants are invited by email to participate. After accepting the invitation, participants will be sent a link to a tree test activity that contains XX tasks. For each task, the participant will be asked to locate in the menu tree where they believe a specific task can be completed. Test logistics



## Hypotheses and Conclusions

**1. Family members and caregivers will navigate to the family member hub for information on benefits for themselves**
    - _Definitely true. _ For the 5 tasks related to finding benefit information for themselves, 59% of the particpants navigated directly to the family member hub, versus only 32% who navigated to one of the benefit hubs first.  Overall, 64% of the participants visited the family member hub at some point to complete the tasks.

**2. Family members and caregivers will navigate to the family member hub to complete tasks related to managing and tracking their own benefits**
    - _Maybe true._  For the 3 tasks related to managing their own health and benefits, only 33% of the participants navigated directly to the family member hub, versus 55% who navigated to one of the benefit hubs first. Overall, 42% of the participants visited the family member hub at some point to complete the tasks. 
    
**3. Survivors will navigate to the section labeled "Survivors" in the family member hub to find information on benefits**
    - _Maybe true._  For the 3 tasks specific to survivor benefits, 39% of the participants navigated directly to the survivors section of the family member hub.  Overall, 45% of the participants visited the survivors section of the family member hub at some point to complete the tasks.

**4. Caregivers will navigate to the section labeled "Caregivers" in the family member hub to find information on benefits**
    - _Likely true._  For the 1 task specific to caregiver benefits, 44% of the participants navigated directly to the caregiver section of the family member hub.  Overall, 51% of the participants visited the caregivers section of the family member hub at some point to complete the task.

## Key Findings

_The 5-10 top findings from your study should be listed here. Write your findings so that if someone reads only these bullets they can leave feeling they got useful information and the study was worthwhile. Examples might be "Most participants used the Search field to find the form, and searched for the term 'veteran health'" or "Most participants struggled with the secondary caregiver section on the form"._
