## Product impacts <a id="product-impacts"></a>
_All products, content areas, and navigation elements impacted by this effort that will require content, design, development, or IA changes_

**Resources and support**
  - Ability to select more than 1 audience - Complete
  - Review audience tags and look at potential for subtags (like survivor)
  - Landing page design: We'll want to add a family member topic section. This isn't a launch blocker.
  - How do visitors filter by audience and benefit?

**Health care:**
- **Caregiver form (10-10CG)** is in family member, but will have to move so will have a URL change. May be impacted by the broader build out of the area.
- **CHAMPVA** form is in development. We'll need to make sure the form launches at the URL it will live at or will be able to move post-launch.
- There will be more health care forms, but this work should be done before they launch.

**Disability:**
  - DIC: No live forms. Check with benefits on timing for forms and coordinate URL. This will be a tricky one because it's the 534-EZ which is for DIC, Pension, and Accrued benefits. There's also a 535-EZ for parent pension. There's another form for Accrued benefits. And there's a supporting form.

**Education:**
  - **DEA (22-5490) (also for FRY):** Form will move into the family member hub and will require a URL change.
  - **Use transferred benefits (22-1990E):** Form will move into the family member hub and will require a URL change.
  - STEM: Won't move because it's for both Veterans and family members.

**Careers**
  - PCPG (25-8832): Won't move because this is for Veterans and dependents.

**Pension**
  - Same form as DIC.

**Housing**
  - Surviving spouse COE: Forms are not online at this time. Will need to connect with benefits as forms get digitized.

**Life insurance**
  - No forms live on VA.gov at this time.

**Burials**
  - Pre-need: Form won't move because it's for Veterans and family members.
  - None of the memorial item forms are online at this time.
  - **Burial allowance:** This should move into family member hub, but we may need to have more conversation about it

**Top nav**
  - Do we want to implement a flyout menu? There isn't one now. Let's revisit the conversation about the 2 column headers for hubs that don't necessarily map to "Get"/"Manage" (like this one and records). Will revisit this. We can do the discovery around the technical lift and then will decide if we try to include this in the launch.

**Home page:**
- Nothing needed for launch

**Hub page**
  - For tasks: Don't use teaser text
  - Future: Exploration around adding actual tags pulled from CMS (vs. our "pseudo" tags that are there now) and making them interactive to impact display.

**Benefit detail pages**
  - Future: Exploration around dynamically pulling in top Q&As or top R&S pages.

**Left nav:**
  - We'll need to implement this. We'll need to determine what we want to call the spokes.
  - How do we want to handle the references to family member programs in the benefit hubs? We don't want to remove those, but we also don't want to have duplicative pages in both the benefit hubs and the family member hubs. We may have duplicative landing pages for family member benefits for a bit.

**Footer:**
  - Add "Family member" link in the audience column for footer.

**Search**
  - No changes needed at this time. CAIA to determine any best bet changes.


## Roll-out approach <a id="roll-out"></a>

Benefits hub pages/forms/tools will be roll-out hub by hub in the following rough approach:

1. Top-level hub and landing pages
2. Health care (Health care and disability in family member hub)
4. Education
5. Disability
6. Pension
7. Life insurance (this does not involve any content moves and can be shifted where needed in the order)
8. Careers
9. Housing
10. Burials

- Establish the overall structure needed in the new family member hub and build out appropriate landing pages and links
- Build out new content and modified Veteran content by hub
- Complete any design and development work needed to support moving forms/tools to their new location
- Move any existing content pages
- Implement redirects
