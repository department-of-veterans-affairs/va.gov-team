08/2023 | Family member benefits = Benefits where the family member is the beneficiary of the benefit, or receives the benefit | This will be used to determine what lives within the family hub. 
08/2023 | Scope for this initial effort will focus on the explore and apply content and forms of the family benefit experience, as well as resources and support pages.  <br> We will not be moving pages and features related to managing or tracking your benefits into the family hub. | Manage tools serve both Veterans and family members and cannot be duplicated.  <br>Some manage tools are not clear on if or how well they support family members.  <br>The broader auth experience will work to better organize auth tools, while the benefit hub optimization goal is to focus on explore and apply content.
