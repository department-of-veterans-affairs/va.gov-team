# Resources and Support non-OCTO author pilot hypotheses

**Note:** We don’t have existing training materials or knowledge management articles specific to R&S. Therefore, the pilot is designed to be a very close collaboration between the OCTO content team and the pilot participants. The OCTO content team can help bridge the gap with training, as we plan on working with content authors hand in hand. For example, we plan to hold the following:
 - Content template and structure discussions as part of the content planning group process, where we discuss content strategy for articles.
 - Content creation sessions where we work directly with the content authors to create articles and talk through questions, things we’ve learned authoring content, etc.
 - Checklist review sessions where our copy editor goes through the content checklist with the content author before publishing.

## Hypothesis 1: Clear “content eligibility criteria” for the Veteran and other beneficiaries benefit experience (and specifically for R&S content vs. benefit hub content) and a content planning group that reviews proposals for R&S articles will help to ensure that R&S articles are strategic, findable, SEO-friendly, and non-duplicative.

### What we want to learn:
- Are there points of confusion/“gray areas” in the eligibility criteria?
- What percentage of proposed R&S articles do not meet the eligibility criteria for R&S or benefit hubs? What patterns arise in what type of content these are and what other "homes" might we need to create for content?
- How can we make the intake and planning process as easy and smooth as possible?
- How big of a burden is this work on the members of the content planning group?
- What size/configuration of this group is most effective for a content planning group to offer needed guidance while keeping workflows moving?
- What will be the best way to ensure appropriate crosslinking to new/updated R&S articles (for example, from the benefit hubs)? And how much of this can we make dynamic in the future (i.e., surface top 5 R&S links/Q&As on related benefit hub page)?
- What challenges does the group face as they do this work? 

## Hypothesis 2: As the volume of R&S articles grows, we’ll need to create an easier way for the content planning group to track and search the article library.

### What we want to learn:
- What are the issues with the current system of tracking (a GitHub file)?
- Where is the best place for a list/search tool to live (i.e., inside the CMS, etc.)?
- What will be most effective to inform search (i.e., search by benefit area, primary keyword, etc.)?

## Hypothesis 3: A content checklist (and a final manual review by the VA.gov content team for now at least for now) will ensure that R&S articles meet the minimum VA.gov content and accessibility standards.

### What we want to learn: 
- How much of this work needs to be done through manual review vs., for example, a SiteImprove or the CMS or another tool in the future?
- What’s easy vs. confusing in the checklist?
- How much of the checklist do/can content authors complete themselves vs. the OCTO copy editor needing to change and/or guide authors through? 
- What role can our digital media partners in VHA, VBA, NCA play in this process given workflows and capacity?

## Hypothesis 4: Feedback data and analytics will allow the VA.gov content team to determine which R&S articles aren’t performing well and engage in regular comprehension testing to make targeted improvements.

### What we want to learn:
- What will we create as our thresholds for when an article should be flagged for comprehension/usability testing?
- What cadence do we want to establish for testing?
- What methods will be most helpful in testing?
- How will we engage our VA partners in testing efforts?

## Hypothesis 5: We need to revisit the existing tag/category structure to better set up R&S for growth. In addition, we'll need to continually evaluate the tags as we add content (i.e., we may need to add new tags).

### What we want to learn:
- Will content authors struggle to effectively assign tags (for example, audience tags)?

## Hypothesis 6: Veterans and other beneficiaries will face navigational challenges between the benefit hubs and R&S articles without an explicit "Go back to last page" path between the 2.
- Do specific types of articles cause more navigational confusion than others?
- As we streamline benefit hubs and rely more on crosslinking between hubs and R&S, how much do people use those crosslinks from the benefit hubs and at what points during the application flow?
- What CTA guidance and/or "rules" can we create to ensure that crosslinks are as helpful and effective as possible? For example, does every R&S article that relates directly to a VA benefit have to have 2 CTAs (1 to the benefit application and 1 to the benefit hub "About" page)?

## Hypothesis 7: We will incur content, design, and technical debt as we move forward with existing R&S templates because we know that we ultimately want to structure content for greater flexibility and create-once-publish-everywhere (COPE) reuse.

### What we want to learn:
- What can we do now with the content types/components we have to help restructure content for better reuse in the future?
