# Creating new content in the VA.gov Veteran benefit experience

## Step 1: Determine if and where your content belongs in the Veteran benefit experience

Use our content placement criteria to determine if your content belongs in the Veteran benefit content experience. If the content you're evaluating has multiple pieces to it (for example, eligibility criteria for a VA benefit + related questions and answers about eligibility), use the criteria to evaluate each piece of content on its own.

Does your content meet both of these requirements?
- [ ] Content speaks directly to Veterans, service members, or family members, **and**
- [ ] Content directly supports a Veteran, service member, or family member in discovering, applying for, tracking, managing, or using a VA benefit or service

If yes, your content belongs in the Veteran benefit experience. If not, your content may belong somewhere else within the VA content ecosystem.

Now, use our additional content placement criteria to determine if your content's primary home should be a VA.gov benefit hub or the VA.gov Resources and Support section.

Does your content meet this requirement?
- [ ] Content supports a benefit that has a unique application or application process that results in the beneficiary receiving a core or supplemental benefit.

**And** does your content provide an overview with basic, high-level information about one of these topics?
- [ ] A tool needed to manage or use the benefit or service, **or**
- [ ] What the person gets with the benefit (including current compensation rates), **or**
- [ ] Top-level benefit eligibility, **or**
- [ ] Instructions on how to apply

If yes, your content's primary home should be in a VA.gov benefit hub. Contact the VA.gov content team...

If no, your content's primary home should be in Resources and Support. Move to Step 2.

Content in Resources and Support must meet at least one of these goals:
 - [ ] Provides supplemental eligibility, evidence information, or application instructions for a benefit, **or**
 - [ ] Explains ways to use a VA benefit,**or**
 - [ ] Provides more information about a specific program, service, or sub-benefit that a person can use after they apply for a VA benefit, **or**
- [ ] Provides a brief overview and link to more information about a Veteran benefit from another government agency (like DoD), **or**
- [ ] Provides support for signing into and using VAâ€™s digital tools, **or**
- [ ] Answers a question that Veterans, service members, or family members have about VA benefits and services (based on contact center reports, search data, and user feedback)

## Step 2: Make sure your content is unique

Search the Resources and Support library to make sure there isn't already content on this topic. If there is...[fill in]

## Step 3: Choose your template

Before you write content for Resources and Support, you'll need to choose a template. Some Resources and Support templates offer more flexibility, while others have a limited number of components to choose from and stricter character counts. Following the template from the start will help you avoid needing to go back and rewrite content to fit the template when you go into Drupal to build the content.

Resources and Support offers these templates:

_Note: Provide Word doc templates for these_

- **Step-by-step to template:** Choose this template if your content describes a process that has a series of steps that must happen in order.
- **Checklist template:** Choose this template if your content describes a collection of items that the person must have or gather, or a collection of steps that don't need to occur in order.
- **About template:** Choose this template if your content will provide Veterans or other beneficiaries information that fits together in a cohesive flow. _Add more guidance on About templates_
- **Single Q&As and multiple FAQs:** [Read our guidance on FAQs](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/content-patterns-and-standards/faqs.md)
- **Media list:** Choose this template if you need to provide a collection of images on a related topic.
- **Video list:** Choose this template if you need to provide a collection of videos on a related topic. 

## Step 3: Determine your H1 page header

Here's how to determine your H1:
- Do your search engine optimization (SEO) research and/or check contact center data. Try to include a keyword or phrase that people are using to talk about this topic in your H1.
- Do a search on VA.gov using your proposed H1. This will help you double check that there isn't already existing or similar content. 
- Follow the VA.gov content style guide guidance for H1s.
