As part of digital modernization, we want to open up the Resources & Support section of VA.gov to more VA content authors. To do this effectively, we need to create guidelines and processes around 3 areas:

- Content strategy (for individual R&S articles and for using R&S as one tool within the broader VA content ecosystem)
- Content quality assurance
- Authoring experience

_*Adding more, but details can be found here for now: [Non-OCTO author pilot.pptx](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/files/7942108/Non-OCTO.author.pilot.pptx)

## Success metrics

### Resources and support/Community care migration pilot success metrics

1. **Veteran and other beneficiary content from legacy Community Care site is deprecated and redirected.** We'll know we've succeeded when all Veteran and beneficiary content on the legacy Community Care site is deprecated and redirected to content in the modernized VA.gov environment.

2. **New CC Resources and Support articles have a 70% or higher feedback rating.** We'll know we've succeeded when all new CC articles have a 70% or higher feedback rating after 3 months. If ratings are lower than 70%, we will prioritize the lowest-performing articles and conduct analytics discovery followed by usability testing to determine opportunities for improvement.

### Overall content placement criteria success metrics

1. **New Resources and Support articles that move previous hub content into R&S have an average feedback rating of 70% or higher.** We'll know we've succeeded if these resources and support articles average a 70% or higher feedback rating as we continuously iterate and move content into resources and support. If ratings are lower than 70%, we will prioritize the lowest-performing articles and conduct analytics discovery followed by usability testing to determine opportunities for improvement.

2. **New targeted Resources and Support articles improve VA's visibility for relevant targeted information.** We'll know we've successed if VA's SEO ranking for relevant targeted keywords improves and individual pageviews increased from on-page interactions (ex. accordion clicks).
