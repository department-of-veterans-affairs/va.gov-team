As part of digital modernization, we want to open up the Resources & Support section of VA.gov to more VA content authors. To do this effectively, we need to create guidelines and processes around 3 areas:

- Content strategy (for individual R&S articles and for using R&S as one tool within the broader VA content ecosystem)
- Content quality assurance
- Authoring experience

_*Adding more, but details can be found here for now: [Non-OCTO author pilot.pptx](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/files/7942108/Non-OCTO.author.pilot.pptx)

## Success metrics

### Resources and support/Community care migration pilot success metrics

1. **Veteran and other beneficiary content from legacy Community Care site is deprecated and redirected.** We'll know we've succeeded when all Veteran and beneficiary content on the legacy Community Care site is deprecated and redirected to content in the modernized VA.gov environment.

2. **New CC Resources and Support articles have a 70% or higher feedback rating.** We'll know we've succeeded when all new CC articles have a 70% or higher feedback rating after 3 months. If ratings are lower than 70%, we will prioritize the lowest-performing articles and conduct analytics discovery followed by usability testing to determine opportunities for improvement.

### Overall content placement criteria success metrics

1. **New Resources and Support articles that move previous hub content into R&S have an average feedback rating of 70% or higher.** We'll know we've succeeded if these resources and support articles average a 70% or higher feedback rating as we continuously iterate and move content into resources and support. If ratings are lower than 70%, we will prioritize the lowest-performing articles and conduct analytics discovery followed by usability testing to determine opportunities for improvement.

2. **New targeted Resources and Support articles improve VA's visibility for relevant targeted information.** We'll know we've successed if VA's SEO ranking for relevant targeted keywords improves and individual pageviews increased from on-page interactions (ex. accordion clicks).

3. **The application conversion funnel for hubs increases as we implement content placement criteria strategy.** We'll know we've succeeded if we have an increase in application introduction pageviews coming from affected pages (about benefit, eligibility, how to apply) as well as new R&S pages and if we have an increase in completed applications. If we see an increase in pageviews without an increase in succesful completions, we'll conduct analytics and usability testing discovery to determine opportunities for improvement.
