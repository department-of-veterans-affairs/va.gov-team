# What we're learning during the Resources and Support author pilot

## Author experience

### Finding

Some web managers manage the online content, but don't generate the content themselves. Instead, that content comes from SMEs. We'll need to think about how that impacts the intake and editorial process.

#### Proposed/WIP solutions
 - Engage web managers in deeper content training and support to help them both take a more active role in content creation and become confident advocates for plain language and content design. This training and support is already planned.
 - Create a brief version of training/awareness for SMEs to build shared understanding and advocacy.
 - Include web managers as the point of contact for the content governance planning group and have them actively working with the content experts in that group and on the VA.gov content team.
 - Ensure that we have sufficient VA.gov content team capacity to support growing R&S needs.
 - Continue to deepen and expand content placement criteria and style guide standards and make it easy for web managers to find, use, and share these resources with their SMEs.
 - Establish an easy, automated notifications and workflow process (already planned by CMS team).

### Finding

Some of the content that program sites have on their sites now will move not into R&S, but into the benefit hubs. Only OCTO and our digital media partners have access to editing the benefit hubs. We also have a totally different process for plain language and content design reviews. We'll need to further think about and discuss how to best manage these scenarios and change management. Ideally, benefit hub content is largely evergreen and shouldn't need a lot of regular updating.

#### Proposed/WIP solutions

 - Ensure rolling audits are in place for all benefit hubs content, with program-level web managers aware and involved (and potentially leading). This is already underway and we'll need to further document and socialize with all involved.
 - Establish an easy, automated notifications and workflow process (already planned by CMS team).

## Content migration

### Finding 

We're learning more about some of the benefits as we dig deeper into program content. This is elevating the need for some more benefit information to move into the hub or for us to move some existing content into different parts of the hubs (i.e. out of disability into family member). From a content strategy perspective, this shows how complicated migrating content is and will continue to be and reinforces our approach of working closely with our VA partners and implementing strong governance rather than simply opening resources and support. 

We also had a participate comment that this is the first time they've been intimately involved in a content strategy/IA effort and really appreciate fully understanding the thinking and process.

  - **Example 1:** The Spina Bifida and CWVV programs looked at first like a few simple pages in the legacy community care site. However, the strategy is now to move existing content from disability to family member hub and to find ways to best surface deeper pharmacy benefit information for these audiences (plus CHAMPVA audience). There's also content around pharmacy benefits that's shared by both the beneficiary and provider audiences. This means we need to now consider how to best guide our partners on how to ensure a good provider experience once we migrate this content.
  - **Example 2:** The Foreign Medical Program is a benefit that we don't have strong representation for in our hub yet. However, it meets criteria for hub placement rather than R&S.

#### Proposed/WIP solutions

 - Plan for close collaboration/leading for full migration efforts and continue to use this as an opportunity to help more VA partners build content strategy skills and to build stronger, more collaborative efforts with VA partners.
 - Ensure that we have sufficient VA.gov content team capacity to support growing R&S needs.
 - Continue to deepen and expand content placement criteria and style guide standards and make it easy for web managers to find, use, and share these resources with their SMEs.

### Finding

We're finding deeper "manage" tasks beyond the core tasks that we have in the hubs now. We're leaning toward R&S (not solidified yet) for those now when they're not attached to a core Veteran benefit. But we're going to need to continue to explore this.

### Finding

We're finding content (like on IVF) that gets into very specific information on how to get treatment for a certain condition. This is potentially a huge bucket of content. We'll need to keep discussing and exploring how best to handle that, including how this content will be maintained and updated.

## Templates and reusable content

### Finding

We're really seeing the limitations of single Q&As being the only reusable content and only being able to be reused as part of multi-FAQs pages. It makes content strategy decisions harder because we often have to sacrifice either good content design or reusability.

#### Proposed/WIP solutions

- First, we'd like to explore with the CMS team whether we can make single Q&As reusable beyond FAQs pages. For example, can we give authors the ability to add single Q&As to a R&S detail page? This would allow an author to create a page with brief, structured sections and then add a few related Q&As.
- We need to continue moving toward a broader reusable content model. No action for teams here right now.

## Taxonomy and tagging

### Finding

We're learning that we're going to need to keep iterating on taxonomy and tagging within R&S. As we bring in content around topics like pharmacy benefits or how to find a provider for CHAMPVA and other family member programs, we're going to need clear ways to distinguish that content from pharmacy benefit/find a provider content for Veterans. We anticipate that each new program will bring more complications like this to consider. 

### Proposed/WIP solutions

- In the near-term, we'll need to add some topic tags to help with sorting/cohesion of community care content that we're migrating. We know that these will be MVP and that we'll iterate, but we want to add them and track their use.
- Danielle and Mikki are beginning to explore more around potential taxonomy iteration in [this folder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/content/governance/taxonomy/resources-and-support). We'll reach out to PW/CMS teams when ready to discuss further.
