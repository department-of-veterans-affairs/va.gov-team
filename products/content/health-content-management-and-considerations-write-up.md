# VA.gov health content management and considerations

The goal of this document is to provide additional clarity around health content ownership and management on VA.gov for OCTO teams working on health-related products.

## Get benefits section

This section includes content about the following topics:
- About VA health benefits
- Eligibility
- How to apply [with the 10-10EZ application itself in react]
- After you apply
- Family health benefits

The VA.gov sitewide content and IA team and VHA digital team own the content in this section, in close collaboration with other OCTO and VHA teams. The VA.gov sitewide content and IA team works with the OCTO health apps product team and VHA member services on the 10-10EZ application itself.

**Notes on content strategy and IA of this section:**
-  This content must remain easy to find for people with little to no familiarity with VA, including those with limited English proficiency. This will be particularly important as the PACT Act opens up health care eligibility to millions more Veterans.
- The VA.gov sitewide crew is engaged in 3 current, ongoing content and IA strategy efforts for this section. We must take these efforts into account when discussing proposed changes around IA and content in this section:
  - An effort to harden the content model for benefit eligibility and how to apply information across health care and other benefits to enable reusability (i.e., Create once publish everywhere, COPE, or Create once reuse everywhere, CORE).
  - An effort to streamline this section as well as other "Get benefits" sections (reflected in the "H1" concept that we're currently testing). The goal of this effort is to make this section as easy as possible for Veterans and family members who are not familiar with VA to find, understand, and take action on. As part of this effort, some of the deeper content in this section may move into the Resources and support section of the site in the future.
  - An effort to offer this section as well as other vital benefit content in Spanish. 

**Notes on content ownership and management of this section:**
- The VA.gov sitewide content and IA team and VHA digital will continue to own the "Get benefit" content. Therefore, these teams must be full strategic, decision-making partners in any restructuring efforts and must lead any writing efforts for this content.
- The VA.gov sitewide content and IA team must maintain the ability to independently change, remove, or add content in this section and to publish updates immediately when needed for urgent requests. This content can't be dependent on the daily deploy for publishing.

## Manage benefits section

This section includes mainly landing pages to online tools that currently live in different places:

- VA online scheduling (tool lives on VA.gov and Cerner's My VA Health)
- Prescription refill, secure messages, lab and test results, medical records (tools live on MHV and Cerner)
- Order hearing aid batteries, order prosthetic socks (tools live on VA.gov)
- Travel pay (tool lives on BTSSS, from AccessVA, though goal is to move to VA.gov)
- Get a Veteran health identification card (tool lives on AccessVA)
- Update your health benefits information (not an online tool)

### Notes on content ownership and management

The VA.gov sitewide content and IA team currently manages this content. The content is currently owned by the VA.gov sitewide content and IA team and relevant product partners/SMEs.

When the health apartment is in place, we'll need to clearly document which teams will be responsible for actively managing each piece of this content and how the teams will work with the different SMEs and with each other to make sure that content is consistent and adheres to the VA.gov content style guide. Any teams working on this content can come to the VA.gov sitewide content and IA team for guidance and reviews and will still go through the collaboration cycle.

### Notes on the COVID-19 content in this section

This section also includes the **COVID-19 vaccine mini-hub**. The VA.gov sitewide content and IA team owns and manages this content (in partnership with our clinical SMEs). We'll need to determine if this will continue to live in this section or elsewhere.

This content is regularly updated in 3 different languages (English, Spanish, and Tagalog). The VA.gov sitewide content and IA team must maintain the ability to independently change, remove, or add to this content and to publish immediately when needed for urgent requests.

### Notes on the content around paying your copay bill in this section

This section also currently includes content about **paying your VA copay bill** that links to a tool that lives on VA.gov. However, the near-future state of this is a combined debt tool because VA is moving toward a "one VA" approach to all debt, including both benefit overpayment debt and copay bills. 

The "Pay your VA copay bill" link will link out of the health hub and over to a combined debt experience under "va.gov/manage-va-debt." Supplemental content will live in Resources and support (as some does already now).

This content is owned by the VA.gov sitewide content and IA team, the debt management center, and VHA finance. We'll need to determine how to link to or reuse this content in the context of the health hub, since its primary home will be within the combined debt experience.

The VA.gov content team must maintain the ability to independently change, remove, or add to this content and to publish immediately when needed for urgent requests.

## More resources section
 
This section includes **copay rates**. These rates will likely move into the main **Get benefits** section based on analytics showing rates as one of the most highly trafficked pages. The rest of the content in this section may move into Resources and support based on ongoing content and IA strategy work.

This content is owned by the VA.gov sitewide content and IA team, VHA digital media, and VHA finance.

The VA.gov sitewide content and IA team must maintain the ability to independently change, remove, or add to this content and to publish immediately when needed for urgent requests.
 
## Future health content in Resources and support
 
The VA.gov sitewide crew is actively working on migration plans for a significant volume of legacy health and benefit content. Some of that content will go into the health hub. And much of that content will likely go into Resources and Support, with the understanding that R&S is an MVP product and will need continual monitoring, evaluation, and iteration.
 
The goal is to open Resources and Support content management to more program office teams across VA, with the VA.gov sitewide content and IA team and VHA digital media providing strategic guidance and governance. The VA.gov sitewide content and IA team, VHA digital media, and other content contributors must maintain the ability to independently change, remove, or add content in this section and to publish updates immediately when needed for urgent requests. 
 
## Future health condition and patient education content
 
VHA is engaged in a significant effort to restructure and improve health condition and patient education content. At this time, there is no specific location identified for this content. However, any discussions around it must start in the context of this overall effort.
