## August 2025

### Content style guide

#### [Links](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/links)

- Revised guidance on inline/embedded links:<br>
> In general, put a link on a separate line to help it stand out. Have a case where you think an inline link might be necessary due to space limitations? Contact the centralized content team for help with your content.
- Fixed broken link to the Links component page.

### Components

### Patterns

## July 2025

### Content style guide

#### [Bulleted and numbered lists](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/bulleted-lists)

-	Changed the page title to **Bulleted and numbered lists**.
-	Added a new section on links in lists:<br>
> **Links in lists**<p>
    •	List items can be links in certain situations. But we don’t want to overwhelm people with a long list of links, if possible.<br>
    •	Not all items in a list need to be a link. It’s okay to have only 1 or 2 items in a list linked.<br>
    •	If every item in a list is a link, keep the list short (less than 7 items). Every link should go to a different location—don’t link to the same page multiple times in the list.<br>
    •	When a list item is a link, the entire list item must be part of the link. Don’t link just 1 or 2 words.

-	Added guidance around when to use conjunctions:<br>
> **Example of bulleted list with conjunctions**<p>
    For complex eligibility criteria, we use the conjunctions “and” or “or” at the end of each individual requirement in the list to help make the relationship between the requirements clear. In these cases, use a comma before the conjunction and bold the “**and**” or “**or**” at the end of each bullet point. Always separate out lists of “**and**” and “**or**” requirements.

-	We also revised the examples and made edits to the current guidance to fit our style, but these changes don’t impact the guidance itself.

Added PII/PHI information

### Components

#### [Additional info](https://design.va.gov/components/additional-info)

-	Specified that titles should be one sentence with no ending punctuation.
-	Clarified what formatting is okay to use in body copy (lists and links are okay). Removed mentions of using headings in the component (these might be better as accordions).
-	Updated the guidance on the length of the content to fewer than 500 characters (with spaces) when possible. The component won't cut off the content at 500, but we should aim to keep these on the shorter side.

#### [Breadcrumbs](https://design.va.gov/components/breadcrumbs#privacy-guidance)

## June 2025

### Content style guide

#### [Neutral language](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/neutral-language)

-	Added "see" and "listen" to the section title: **We avoid “view,” “see,” “hear,” and “listen”**
-	Added:<br>
> Because we don’t know how a person is accessing the content, we should avoid any interaction-based language.

#### [Bulleted lists](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/bulleted-lists)

-	Added numbered lists to the current guidance. We follow the same guidance as with bulleted lists, except that we should only use numbered lists for steps in a process or anything that needs to be in a specific order.
-	Clarified that ordered list = numbered list and unordered list = bulleted list. You'll see both terms used interchangeably across the Design System.
- Added:<br>
> Avoid using “the following” in the list introduction and use a less formal phrase instead. For example, instead of “You’ll need the following documents,” use “You’ll need these documents.”
- Added:<br>
> **Don’t combine the list items’ starting word or phrase with the introduction.** For example, don’t introduce the list with “All of these must be true. You’re:” In this case, each item should start with “You’re.” This helps when the content needs to be translated into another language.
- Added:<br>
> **Avoid using sub-bullets.** Sub-bullets can make the content harder to scan. If possible, make the item with sub-bullets a separate list.<br>
**Note:** Bulleted lists can be used in step-by-step lists.
- Added:<br>
> **Note:** Don't use "and/or" in lists. Instead, restructure the content to list all options (for example, "your income and/or net worth" should be "your income, your net worth, or both").

#### [Punctuation](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/punctuation)

- Added guidance for hint text:
>    • If the hint text has 1 or more full sentences, add a period to the end of each sentence<br>
     • If the hint text is a sentence fragment, don’t add a period
- Added guidance for error messages:
>    • For error messages in individual form fields, don’t add a period at the end of the message unless it has 2 or more full sentences<br>
     • For error messages that use the Alert component, add a period at the end of each sentence

#### [Button labels](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/button-labels)

Removed contradictory CTA examples at the end of the page

#### [Capitalization](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/capitalization)

Added mobile app capitalization info/exceptions: interface buttons are sentence case and native actions are title case for iOS and all caps for Android

#### [Dates, times, phone numbers, and addresses](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/dates-and-numbers)

-	Times and time zones: Added mobile app exceptions to times/time zone formatting:<br>
> **Note:** For the mobile app, when times/time zones aren’t hardcoded, the formatting differs from VA.gov due to default formatting in React Native. For example, React Native formats as AM and PM (both letters capitalized and no punctuation) and EST (three-letter format). We make an exception to our style guide for this default formatting.
- Times and time zones: Flipped the "We're open..." example so it follows how we currently word it: "We're open Monday through Friday, 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. ET."
-	Times and time zones: Combined the two like this/not this examples into one at the end of the bulleted list.
-	Zip codes: Updated guidance around the extra 4 digits:<br>
>    • When Veterans fill out their address, we don’t require them to include the extra 4 digits of their zip code. They only need to provide the 5-digit zip code.<br>
     • When we provide an address to Veterans, we sometimes include the extra 4 digits of the zip code. If we include the extra 4 digits, use a hyphen (ex. 12345-6789).

#### [Word list](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/word-list)

-	Added the "MFA" acronym to "multifactor authentication"
-	Updated these existing entries:
> **condition vs. disability:** Added: For non-Veterans, like beneficiaries and dependents, we use “disability” (or “disabled” depending on the context) to describe an illness or injury that affects your mind or body. Default to people-first language in general content that describes individuals with a disability. For example, “Was this trust created for a Veteran’s child who was seriously disabled before age 18?”<br>
[Learn more in the Health content section](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/health-content/)

> **disability rating:** Specifying this is for Veterans only

- Added these new entries:
> **and/or:** Don't use "and/or" in lists or body copy. Instead, restructure the content to list all options (for example, "your income and/or net worth" should be "your income, your net worth, or both").

> **illegal:** Avoid using the term “illegal.” Instead, our preferred term is “not allowed by law.” Don’t use “illegal” to describe a person.

> **please:** We’re moving away from using “please” in most cases. Avoid using “please” as a default and only if needed in a specific situation. This is a change that we’re working to address across our current components.

> **power of attorney (POA):** "POA" is capitalized. Contact the subject matter experts or legal before using this term to make sure we're using it correctly.

> **required by law and not allowed by law:** These are our preferred terms to describe a legal requirement or something that is against the law.

> **user:** We should avoid the term “user” or “users” and instead use “Veterans” or “people” (when referring to a more general audience). “Users” can have a negative connotation and focuses only on how people are using our products. This is a change that we’re working to address across our current content.
- Removed the "Premium" entry

### Components

#### [Button](https://design.va.gov/components/button/), [Button group](https://design.va.gov/components/button/button-group), [Button - Segmented](https://design.va.gov/components/button/button-segmented), and [Button - Icon](https://design.va.gov/components/button/button-icon)

Removed contradictory CTA examples at the end of the content considerations

#### [Address block](https://design.va.gov/components/address-block)

Zip codes: Updated guidance around the extra 4 digits:
> • When Veterans fill out their address, we don’t require them to include the extra 4 digits of their zip code. They only need to provide the 5-digit zip code.<br>
  • When we provide an address to Veterans, we sometimes include the extra 4 digits of the zip code. If we include the extra 4 digits, use a hyphen (ex. 12345-6789).

### Patterns

#### [Email addresses](https://design.va.gov/patterns/ask-users-for/email-address)

-	Updated and added new examples for telling people why we need their contact information:
>    •	We may use your contact information to contact you if we have questions about your application.<br>
     •	We may use your contact information to contact you if there’s an issue with your application.<br>
     •	We may use your contact information to contact you if we need more information.
-	Made other minor edits to align with our current style.

#### [Phone numbers](https://design.va.gov/patterns/ask-users-for/phone-numbers)

Same updates as the email address pattern

#### [Addresses](https://design.va.gov/patterns/ask-users-for/addresses)

Removed "or 9-" from the postal code error message 3: "Enter a valid 5-digit zip code"

## May 2025

### Content style guide

#### [Destigmatizing language for weight](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/health-content/destigmatizing-language-for-weight)

Added this new page to the **Health content** section in the content style guide

#### [Neutral language](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/neutral-language)

Revised guidance to match our current practices of using "select" instead of "click," "tap," etc.: 

> People can use several different types of interactions for the same task. So, we use “select” instead of “click,” “press,” or “tap.”<p>
Examples:<p>
• In buttons, use “Select **Submit**” instead of “Tap the **Submit** button”<br>
• In links and navigation, use “Select **My VA**” instead of “Click on **My VA**”<br>
• In phone extensions, use “Select 1” instead of “Press 1”<br>
• In step-by-step instructions, use “Select **Save**” instead of “Click **Save**”

#### [Word list](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/word-list)

Added and revised entries:

> **click:** Avoid using “click” and “click here.” Instead, follow these formats:<br>
    • Link the entire call to action where relevant, like this: [Find an accredited representative to help you](https://www.va.gov/ogc/apps/accreditation/index.asp)<br>
    • Use “select” to point someone to a specific place in the UI, like this: In your account dashboard, select **Profile**<br>
    [Learn more in the Neutral language section of the style guide](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/neutral-language)

> **delete:** Use the word “delete” instead of “remove.” For example, “Delete file.”<br>
[Learn more in the Files pattern](https://design.va.gov/patterns/ask-users-for/files)

>	**upload:** Use the word “upload” instead of “add.” For example, “Upload file” and “Upload another file.”<br>

#### [Error messages - Feedback](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/error-messages/feedback) and [Writing for SEO](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/seo)

Removed instances of “click” on these pages and changed to “select.”

#### [Links](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/links)

-	Added information on why we put links on their own line instead of using embedded links:<br>
> Too many embedded links can be distracting or overwhelming to people with traumatic brain injuries or other cognitive impairments. We put links on their own line to help make the page easier to scan and the intention of the link as clear as possible.
-	Clarified guidance about links opening in a new tab (this should only happen under specific circumstances, explained in Components):<br>
> **Note:** If a link needs to open in a new tab, add “(opens in a new tab)” to notify users. Don’t use the new window icon unless there are space constraints.<br>
[Review guidance on when to open links in a new tab in the Components section](https://design.va.gov/components/link/)

#### [Punctuation](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/punctuation)

Added guidance on using punctuation with quotation marks:<br>
> Periods and commas go inside the quotation marks, even if they’re not part of the quoted text. All other punctuation (em dashes, question marks, colons, parentheses) go outside the quotation marks unless they’re part of the quoted text.

#### [Bold & italic text](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/bold-text)

Added guidance on when to bold punctuation:

> **Punctuation with bold text**<p>
**For punctuation following bold text:**<p>
•	If the bold text is an introduction, the colon or period following it should also be bold (ex. the colon after “**Note:**” or the period after a list item introduction, “**Be concise.** Use as few words as possible…”).<br>
•	If the bold text is a full sentence, bold any punctuation within or at the end of the sentence.<br>
•	If the bold text is only part of a sentence, don’t bold punctuation that isn’t part of the bolded phrase (ex. “Select **Continue**, then answer the remaining questions).”

#### [Dates, times, phone numbers, and addresses](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/dates-and-numbers)

-	Added guidance on how to write date ranges:<br>
> Write out date ranges using sentence construction in body copy: This will be available from December 1, 2025, to December 31, 2025.<br>
**Note:** Be intentional when picking “from/to,” “from/through,” or “between/and” for date ranges. Each option can mean different things, so pick the option that best matches your needs.
-	Added guidance on commas after dates:<br>
> Add a comma after the year when using the full construction, unless the date is the end of the sentence. If the date is at the end of the sentence, use the punctuation you’d normally use (period, question mark, colon, no punctuation).

### Components

#### [Link](https://design.va.gov/components/link/)

Clarified guidance on when links can open in a new tab (only under specific circumstances): 

> **Open links in the same window, with exceptions.** Links on VA.gov should open in a new tab only if clicking the link will cause the user to lose progress or data. This should be avoided when possible. In all other cases, links should open in the same window.<br>
