## January 2026

### Content style guide

#### We, us, you

Removed this section. The guidance is available in the [Use conversational language](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/plain-language/use-conversational-language) section.

#### They, their

Removed this section. The guidance is available in the [Neutral language](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/neutral-language) section.

#### [Sign in and identity verification](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/specific-topics-and-programs/sign-in-and-identity-verification)

- Changed the order of accounts in the text so **ID.me** comes before **Login.gov**.
- Removed the guidance to emphasize using **Login.gov**.
- Revised the guidance explaining that **ID.me** and **Login.gov** are accounts and not separate tools:
  > Research has shown that some people confuse **Login.gov** with being a separate tool, and some people think they need to go to the **ID.me** or **Login.gov** websites to sign in rather than VA.gov. So, we reinforce that **ID.me** and **Login.gov** are types of sign-in accounts—not separate tools or websites—by using the phrase “**ID.me** account” or “**Login.gov** account.”
- Added guidance on the term "**DS Logon**":
  > VA no longer offers the ability to sign in with a DS Logon username and password. Use this term only in reference to this option going away or the ability to use this option for Defense Department (DOD) websites.
- Added guidance on using the "MFA" acronym: Introduce "MFA" on the first mention and use "MFA" on any subsequent mentions on the same page.
- Updated the "**My HealtheVet**" guidance:
  > With rare temporary exceptions, VA no longer offers the **My HealtheVet** user ID and password option for sign in. Today, **My HealtheVet on VA.gov** refers instead only to the health portal on VA.gov. When using this term to refer to the portal, “My HealtheVet” is 2 words. Don’t italicize the “e” between “Health” and “Vet” in digital content body copy, headlines, or user interface elements such as links, buttons, and navigation. The “e” is italicized only in the logo and in print materials.<p>
**Note:** We no longer tell Veterans to create new **My HealtheVet** accounts or upgrade existing accounts. We don't use the terms "My HealtheVet basic," "My HealtheVet advanced," or "My HealtheVet Premium." Don't refer to the sign-in account Veterans use to access their health portal as a **My HealtheVet account**. Instead, refer to the type of sign-in account (**ID.me** or **Login.gov**) or simply "your sign-in account."
- Added "My HealtheVet account" to the retired terms and updated the guidance:
  > With rare temporary exceptions, VA no longer offers this sign-in option. Don't refer to the sign-in account Veterans use to access their health portal as a **My HealtheVet account**. Instead, refer to the type of sign-in account (**ID.me** or **Login.gov**) or simply "your sign-in account."

#### [Links](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/links)

- Updated the **Considerations** section to make guidance clearer:
  >• We use links to connect Veterans and other visitors with related information that may be helpful to them.<br>
  • We put links on their own line to help make the page easier to scan and the intention of the link as clear as possible. Too many embedded links can be distracting or overwhelming to people with traumatic brain injuries or other cognitive impairments.<br>
  • We tell people where links are taking them and why. External links can be disorienting for all people, but especially people who use screen readers. 
- Updated guidance in the **Link text** section to make guidance clearer:
  >• Describe the purpose of the linked page<br>
  • If the link takes the reader outside of VA.gov, name the external website in the link text<br>
  • Balance link text length to provide the needed descriptions without having the relevant words get lost in the length<br>
  • Use "Select" instead of "Click here," since not all people are physically clicking links 
- Added a new section on linking to forms: linking to the form's About page instead of the PDF (applies to all content other than the form's About page), linking directly to the form's PDF on the About page, and added exceptions for links to the direct download to the PDF version:
  >• For forms that aren’t part of the VA forms database, you may need to use a direct download link to the PDF version of the form. This is a rare situation. Contact the centralized content and information architecture (IA) team for guidance.<br>
  • You may also need a direct download link if the person filling out the form is downloading and generating their own completed copy. Contact the centralized content and IA team for guidance.
- Added new guidance in the **Linking to documents and other file sources** section:
  >• If a link opens a calendar, YouTube video, XLS, or other file format, add the relevant icon from the Components section in the Design System. This does not apply to pages housed within Drupal.<br>
  • Include the file format (ex. PDF, HTML, or XML) in the link label. Place the file format at the end of the link label in parentheses. For example, “Download the Continuity of Care document (PDF).”<br>
  • If you have a list of links to the same document with different file formats, consider rewording the link text to include the file format earlier. Contact the centralized content and IA team for help with your link text.
- Added guidance on not linking to the Code of Federal Regulations on VA.gov pages.
- Added a new section on [Links in lists](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/links#links-in-lists) that includes general guidance and 3 options for adding links to lists.

#### [Bulleted and numbered lists](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/bulleted-lists)

Updated the [Links in lists](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/links#links-in-lists) section to include 3 options for adding links to lists

## December 2025

### Content style guide

#### [Bulleted and numbered lists](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/bulleted-lists)

- Made edits to the **Considerations** section to align with current style guide guidance
- Added an example and guidance for using "or" at the beginning of a list item:
> **Example of non-eligibility-related bulleted list with “or” at the beginning of the list item**<p>
In some cases, you may need to add “or” to the beginning of the list item. For example, with list items that have 2 or more sentences, the conjunction may work better at the beginning of the second list item than at the end of the first.<p>
**Note:** This guidance only applies to lists that use “or.”

#### [Payments and debts](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/specific-topics-and-programs/payments-and-debts)
Updated the definitions for these terms:

- **copay (or copayment, or health care copay):** We use this term to describe the amount some Veterans pay for certain health care services and prescriptions. On first mention, include a plain language definition. For example, “You may need to pay a copay for outpatient care for conditions not related to your military service. A copay is a fixed amount you owe for the service.”<br>
**Note:** Use “health care copay” on first mention in general content where the context of health care is necessary and then “copay” on subsequent mentions.
- **copay bill (or patient statement, or billing statement):** We use these terms to describe the bill or statement that a Veteran receives for their health care copay. On first mention, include a plain language definition. For example, “You may get a copay bill (or “statement”) for the amount you owe for health care services that aren’t exempt from copays.”
- **debt:** We use this term as the overarching term for any money the Veteran owes to VA. “Debt” encompasses money owed for overpayments as well as copays. If the debt is because of an overpayment or a copay, we should use those terms to explain why the Veteran owes money.
- **overpayment or overpayment debt:** We use this term to refer to a debt that’s because of an overpayment. In some cases, we can go with “overpayments” (and not add “overpayment debts”).
- **waiver (debt forgiveness):** Include “(debt forgiveness)” on first mention. We use this term to describe a debt repayment or relief option in which a Veteran asks VA to forgive (or “waive”) part or all of a debt.<br>
**Note:** Waivers are a debt repayment or relief option for both benefit overpayment and copay debt. Other options include compromise offers, monthly offsets (overpayment debt only), monthly repayment plans, waivers, and write-offs (copay debt only).

#### [Punctuation and formatting](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/punctuation)

- Added formatting information to the section
- Updated the section title to include formatting
- Added guidance on note and form field error message formatting:
  > **Notes**<p>
    • Place notes on their own line directly after the text the note applies to.<br>
    • Capitalize and bold “**Note:**”.<br>
    • If a note applies to only 1 item in a list, place the note directly after that specific list item (not after the full list). Use a soft return (shift + enter on PCs, shift + return on Macs) so the note appears on a separate line, aligned with the list indent, with no space between the lines. Don’t make the note its own bullet or sub-bullet.

  > **Error messages in form fields**<p>
    • Make error messages for form fields sentence case and bold<br>
    • Don’t place a period after the error message unless it has 2 or more sentences<br>
    • In most cases, start error messages with a verb, like “Enter” (for text fields) or “Select” (for radio buttons, checkboxes, and dropdown menus)<br>
    • If an error message references a specific checkbox, radio button, etc., use quotation marks

#### [Error and alert messages](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/error-messages/)

- Updated the section title to include "alert" and added "alert" throughout the page where needed
- Made style guide edits throughout to match current guidance
- Added guidance on heading/title length:
  > **Error and alert message titles**<p>
When possible, keep error and alert message titles (headings) to 50 characters, including spaces. Error and alert message titles should follow the general guidelines for page and section titles.<p>
[Learn more in the Page titles and section titles section of the style guide](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/page-titles-and-section-titles)

#### [Use conversational language](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/plain-language/use-conversational-language)

- Changed the section title from **Use pronouns** to **Use conversational language** to accurately describe the guidance in the section
- Moved the content from the **We, us, you** section to this section<br>
**Note:** The **We, us, you** and **They, their** sections are going to be removed. The content from **We, us, you** is now in this section and the content from **They, their** is in the **Neutral language** section.
- Made edits throughout to align with the style guide
- Updated the main [Plain language standards section](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/plain-language/) to reflect the title change  

### Components

Added an exception to time zone formatting for automated time stamps:

> For automated time stamps from the time library used in vets-website (date-fns), the time zone uses the 3-letter format (ex. EDT).

#### [Links](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/links)

- Revised the guidance on using “1” versus “one” to only use “one” with certain expressions:
> Spell out “one” when it’s used in expressions like one-to-one, one-on-one, one-time, and “one of the reasons…” Use the numeral “1” for all other instances.
- Made edits to the rest of the page to align with our style (these edits don’t affect guidance)

#### [Punctuation](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/punctuation)

- Removed the information on ampersands (moved this to the **Numbers, signs, and symbols** page)
- Added an exception for using quotes when referring to buttons, section titles, etc. if the text is already bold:
> **Note:** If the text is already bold (like in some error messages), we can use quotation marks to reference buttons, screens, or section headers.
- Made edits to the rest of the page to align with our style (these edits don’t affect guidance)

## July 2025

### Content style guide

#### [Bulleted and numbered lists](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/bulleted-lists)

-	Changed the page title to **Bulleted and numbered lists**.
-	Added a new section on links in lists:<br>
> **Links in lists**<p>
    •	List items can be links in certain situations. But we don’t want to overwhelm people with a long list of links, if possible.<br>
    •	Not all items in a list need to be a link. It’s okay to have only 1 or 2 items in a list linked.<br>
    •	If every item in a list is a link, keep the list short (less than 7 items). Every link should go to a different location—don’t link to the same page multiple times in the list.<br>
    •	When a list item is a link, the entire list item must be part of the link. Don’t link just 1 or 2 words.

-	Added guidance around when to use conjunctions:<br>
> **Example of bulleted list with conjunctions**<p>
    For complex eligibility criteria, we use the conjunctions “and” or “or” at the end of each individual requirement in the list to help make the relationship between the requirements clear. In these cases, use a comma before the conjunction and bold the “**and**” or “**or**” at the end of each bullet point. Always separate out lists of “**and**” and “**or**” requirements.

-	We also revised the examples and made edits to the current guidance to fit our style, but these changes don’t impact the guidance itself.

#### [Title tags](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/title-tags#privacy-guidance)

### Components

#### [Additional info](https://design.va.gov/components/additional-info)

-	Specified that titles should be one sentence with no ending punctuation.
-	Clarified what formatting is okay to use in body copy (lists and links are okay). Removed mentions of using headings in the component (these might be better as accordions).
-	Updated the guidance on the length of the content to fewer than 500 characters (with spaces) when possible. The component won't cut off the content at 500, but we should aim to keep these on the shorter side.

#### [Breadcrumbs](https://design.va.gov/components/breadcrumbs#privacy-guidance)

Added PII/PHI information

#### [Button](https://design.va.gov/components/button/#privacy-guidance), [Button group](https://design.va.gov/components/button/button-group#privacy-guidance), [Button - Segmented](https://design.va.gov/components/button/button-segmented#privacy-guidance), and [Button - Icon](https://design.va.gov/components/button/button-icon#privacy-guidance)

## June 2025

### Content style guide

#### [Neutral language](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/neutral-language)

-	Added "see" and "listen" to the section title: **We avoid “view,” “see,” “hear,” and “listen”**
-	Added:<br>
> Because we don’t know how a person is accessing the content, we should avoid any interaction-based language.

#### [Bulleted lists](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/bulleted-lists)

-	Added numbered lists to the current guidance. We follow the same guidance as with bulleted lists, except that we should only use numbered lists for steps in a process or anything that needs to be in a specific order.
-	Clarified that ordered list = numbered list and unordered list = bulleted list. You'll see both terms used interchangeably across the Design System.
- Added:<br>
> Avoid using “the following” in the list introduction and use a less formal phrase instead. For example, instead of “You’ll need the following documents,” use “You’ll need these documents.”
- Added:<br>
> **Don’t combine the list items’ starting word or phrase with the introduction.** For example, don’t introduce the list with “All of these must be true. You’re:” In this case, each item should start with “You’re.” This helps when the content needs to be translated into another language.
- Added:<br>
> **Avoid using sub-bullets.** Sub-bullets can make the content harder to scan. If possible, make the item with sub-bullets a separate list.<br>
**Note:** Bulleted lists can be used in step-by-step lists.
- Added:<br>
> **Note:** Don't use "and/or" in lists. Instead, restructure the content to list all options (for example, "your income and/or net worth" should be "your income, your net worth, or both").

#### [Punctuation](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/punctuation)

- Added guidance for hint text:
>    • If the hint text has 1 or more full sentences, add a period to the end of each sentence<br>
     • If the hint text is a sentence fragment, don’t add a period
- Added guidance for error messages:
>    • For error messages in individual form fields, don’t add a period at the end of the message unless it has 2 or more full sentences<br>
     • For error messages that use the Alert component, add a period at the end of each sentence

#### [Button labels](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/button-labels)

Removed contradictory CTA examples at the end of the page

#### [Capitalization](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/capitalization)

Added mobile app capitalization info/exceptions: interface buttons are sentence case and native actions are title case for iOS and all caps for Android

#### [Dates, times, phone numbers, and addresses](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/dates-and-numbers)

-	Times and time zones: Added mobile app exceptions to times/time zone formatting:<br>
> **Note:** For the mobile app, when times/time zones aren’t hardcoded, the formatting differs from VA.gov due to default formatting in React Native. For example, React Native formats as AM and PM (both letters capitalized and no punctuation) and EST (three-letter format). We make an exception to our style guide for this default formatting.
- Times and time zones: Flipped the "We're open..." example so it follows how we currently word it: "We're open Monday through Friday, 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. ET."
-	Times and time zones: Combined the two like this/not this examples into one at the end of the bulleted list.
-	Zip codes: Updated guidance around the extra 4 digits:<br>
>    • When Veterans fill out their address, we don’t require them to include the extra 4 digits of their zip code. They only need to provide the 5-digit zip code.<br>
     • When we provide an address to Veterans, we sometimes include the extra 4 digits of the zip code. If we include the extra 4 digits, use a hyphen (ex. 12345-6789).

#### [Word list](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/word-list)

-	Added the "MFA" acronym to "multifactor authentication"
-	Updated these existing entries:
> **condition vs. disability:** Added: For non-Veterans, like beneficiaries and dependents, we use “disability” (or “disabled” depending on the context) to describe an illness or injury that affects your mind or body. Default to people-first language in general content that describes individuals with a disability. For example, “Was this trust created for a Veteran’s child who was seriously disabled before age 18?”<br>
[Learn more in the Health content section](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/health-content/)

> **disability rating:** Specifying this is for Veterans only

- Added these new entries:
> **and/or:** Don't use "and/or" in lists or body copy. Instead, restructure the content to list all options (for example, "your income and/or net worth" should be "your income, your net worth, or both").

> **illegal:** Avoid using the term “illegal.” Instead, our preferred term is “not allowed by law.” Don’t use “illegal” to describe a person.

> **please:** We’re moving away from using “please” in most cases. Avoid using “please” as a default and only if needed in a specific situation. This is a change that we’re working to address across our current components.

> **power of attorney (POA):** "POA" is capitalized. Contact the subject matter experts or legal before using this term to make sure we're using it correctly.

> **required by law and not allowed by law:** These are our preferred terms to describe a legal requirement or something that is against the law.

> **user:** We should avoid the term “user” or “users” and instead use “Veterans” or “people” (when referring to a more general audience). “Users” can have a negative connotation and focuses only on how people are using our products. This is a change that we’re working to address across our current content.
- Removed the "Premium" entry

### Components

#### [Button](https://design.va.gov/components/button/), [Button group](https://design.va.gov/components/button/button-group), [Button - Segmented](https://design.va.gov/components/button/button-segmented), and [Button - Icon](https://design.va.gov/components/button/button-icon)

Removed contradictory CTA examples at the end of the content considerations

#### [Address block](https://design.va.gov/components/address-block)

Zip codes: Updated guidance around the extra 4 digits:
> • When Veterans fill out their address, we don’t require them to include the extra 4 digits of their zip code. They only need to provide the 5-digit zip code.<br>
  • When we provide an address to Veterans, we sometimes include the extra 4 digits of the zip code. If we include the extra 4 digits, use a hyphen (ex. 12345-6789).

### Patterns

#### [Email addresses](https://design.va.gov/patterns/ask-users-for/email-address)

-	Updated and added new examples for telling people why we need their contact information:
>    •	We may use your contact information to contact you if we have questions about your application.<br>
     •	We may use your contact information to contact you if there’s an issue with your application.<br>
     •	We may use your contact information to contact you if we need more information.
-	Made other minor edits to align with our current style.

#### [Phone numbers](https://design.va.gov/patterns/ask-users-for/phone-numbers)

Same updates as the email address pattern

#### [Addresses](https://design.va.gov/patterns/ask-users-for/addresses)

Removed "or 9-" from the postal code error message 3: "Enter a valid 5-digit zip code"

## May 2025

### Content style guide

#### [Destigmatizing language for weight](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/health-content/destigmatizing-language-for-weight)

Added this new page to the **Health content** section in the content style guide

#### [Neutral language](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/neutral-language)

Revised guidance to match our current practices of using "select" instead of "click," "tap," etc.: 

> People can use several different types of interactions for the same task. So, we use “select” instead of “click,” “press,” or “tap.”<p>
Examples:<p>
• In buttons, use “Select **Submit**” instead of “Tap the **Submit** button”<br>
• In links and navigation, use “Select **My VA**” instead of “Click on **My VA**”<br>
• In phone extensions, use “Select 1” instead of “Press 1”<br>
• In step-by-step instructions, use “Select **Save**” instead of “Click **Save**”

#### [Word list](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/word-list)

Added and revised entries:

> **click:** Avoid using “click” and “click here.” Instead, follow these formats:<br>
    • Link the entire call to action where relevant, like this: [Find an accredited representative to help you](https://www.va.gov/ogc/apps/accreditation/index.asp)<br>
    • Use “select” to point someone to a specific place in the UI, like this: In your account dashboard, select **Profile**<br>
    [Learn more in the Neutral language section of the style guide](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/neutral-language)

#### [Error messages - Feedback](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/error-messages/feedback) and [Writing for SEO](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/seo)

Removed instances of “click” on these pages and changed to “select.”

#### [Links](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/links)

-	Added information on why we put links on their own line instead of using embedded links:<br>
> Too many embedded links can be distracting or overwhelming to people with traumatic brain injuries or other cognitive impairments. We put links on their own line to help make the page easier to scan and the intention of the link as clear as possible.
-	Clarified guidance about links opening in a new tab (this should only happen under specific circumstances, explained in Components):<br>
> **Note:** If a link needs to open in a new tab, add “(opens in a new tab)” to notify users. Don’t use the new window icon unless there are space constraints.<br>

#### [Punctuation](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/punctuation)

Added guidance on using punctuation with quotation marks:<br>
> Periods and commas go inside the quotation marks, even if they’re not part of the quoted text. All other punctuation (em dashes, question marks, colons, parentheses) go outside the quotation marks unless they’re part of the quoted text.

#### [Bold & italic text](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/bold-text)

Added guidance on when to bold punctuation:

> **Punctuation with bold text**<p>
**For punctuation following bold text:**<p>
•	If the bold text is an introduction, the colon or period following it should also be bold (ex. the colon after “**Note:**” or the period after a list item introduction, “**Be concise.** Use as few words as possible…”).<br>
•	If the bold text is a full sentence, bold any punctuation within or at the end of the sentence.<br>
•	If the bold text is only part of a sentence, don’t bold punctuation that isn’t part of the bolded phrase (ex. “Select **Continue**, then answer the remaining questions).”

#### [Dates, times, phone numbers, and addresses](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/dates-and-numbers)

-	Added guidance on how to write date ranges:<br>
> Write out date ranges using sentence construction in body copy: This will be available from December 1, 2025, to December 31, 2025.<br>
**Note:** Be intentional when picking “from/to,” “from/through,” or “between/and” for date ranges. Each option can mean different things, so pick the option that best matches your needs.
-	Added guidance on commas after dates:<br>
> Add a comma after the year when using the full construction, unless the date is the end of the sentence. If the date is at the end of the sentence, use the punctuation you’d normally use (period, question mark, colon, no punctuation).

### Components

#### [Link](https://design.va.gov/components/link/)

Clarified guidance on when links can open in a new tab (only under specific circumstances): 

> **Open links in the same window, with exceptions.** Links on VA.gov should open in a new tab only if clicking the link will cause the user to lose progress or data. This should be avoided when possible. In all other cases, links should open in the same window.<br>
