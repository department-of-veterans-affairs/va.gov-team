# Goal

Define content patterns to inform phase 1 tool landing page refresh updates. We'll then update these elements across all tool landing pages, starting with health tool landing pages.

### H1s

Most of our tool landing page H1s are CTAs. There are a few exceptions (like "VA prescription refill and tracking") due to past SEO-based decisions.  We are moving away from a primarily SEO focus on these pages and toward getting people into the tool as quickly as possible. And we can still achieve SEO goals with variations. We're also working toward greater phrasing consistency throughout the site for cognitive clarity and to prepare for translation.

Recommend moving to all CTAs (ie, change to "Refill and track VA prescriptions") for consistency.

### Intros

Our previous pattern was:
- Primary SEO keyword within first few words of intro
- Brief description of what the user can do with this tool
- End with CTA using "Find out..." (for tool pages specifically, "Find out if you're eligible and how to sign in to begin using this tool")

We've started to move toward a slightly different pattern:
- Primary SEO keyword in intro, but not necessarily in first few words if it causes us to have to lengthen the intro. Our primary goal has shifted from SEO to getting people into the tools and this minor shift shouldn't have a big impact on SEO. 
- For non-tool pages, end with a CTA of "Keep reading to..." We're shifting this to make it slightly more clear that the information is on this page (vs. a more teaser-like tone of "Find out...").
- For tool pages, can consider a 1-line intro that speaks to what the user will do, as we do on our more recent tool landing pages.

### How can [this tool] help me [do task]?

The original goal of tool landing pages was primarily SEO and targeted at newer users of the tool. We're shifting toward the goal of getting people into the tool faster. Therefore we don't need to surface this question high up on the page. We can instead either include it beneath the "can I use this tool" info or within accordions.

### Am I eligible to use this tool?
 
Previously, we did a sweep through content to make "eligible" a consistent word choice for anything involving eligibility requirements. But it doesn't quite fit with tools. This used to be "Can I use this tool to [do task]?" which really fits better. However, we also want to revisit the use of questions on some of our pages (such as tool pages). And we've talked about whether we need to refer to online tools as "tools" per se.

Consider:
- Can I use this tool?
- Can I [do this task] online?
- What you'll need to [do this task] online _Note: In some cases, might need to be specific (i.e., "on eBenefits") for now._
- What to know about [doing task] online _Note: Could considering using this subhead as an H2 and then a couple specific H3s as needed_
- Other options

### Information displayed as accordions

The VA.gov approach to accordions has shifted over time. There was a time when we didn't want to put text into accordions on pages used primarily for SEO because the thinking was that could hurt SEO. Our goal for these pages has shifted, and thinking around SEO and accordions has also changed. We want to now place more content in accordions on this page to make them more digestible and mobile friendly.

We want to now display only the most critical information on the page (ie, can I use this tool and potentially other key info for specific products). We'll put the rest in accordions.

Consider for accordion group header:

- Questions about [task]
- Common questions about [task]
- Questions you may have about [task]
- Frequently asked questions about [task]

Recommend not using "FAQs" due to avoiding acronyms and recent surfacing of screen reader pronunciation. Leaning toward "Common questions" or simply "Question" for brevity. "Questions you may have about..." can be good in certain circumstances, such as the covid-19 vaccine page, where questions may be more sensitive/personal.

### Future considerations

What belongs on the tool landing pg. versus in Resources & Support? <br>
What might belong in both places?
