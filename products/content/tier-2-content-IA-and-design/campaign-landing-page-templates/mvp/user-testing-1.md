## Summarized and Prioritized Findings

### Feature/Template Enhancements

***Priority 1's - Required for MVP launch***

**1. Audience tags** DONE! early May 2021
- Need to make specifying audience tags more rigid -- currently, those are free-form leading too unexpected outcomes (e.g. authors adding multiple audiences in one field -- e.g. *Spouses, Children and any one who cares for a Veteran*
- Should we use R&S audiences as selectable options?  Or for now, just limit one word per field?
- Should we allow the option to not specify "This Page For"? (This, to avoid the "exlusionary" concern)

**2. Create more visual guidance within the CLP -- or, alternatively a content build doc template outside the CLP -- to make the build process easier, more intutive** DONE - template in Microsoft word.
- Should we replace the illustrated/wireframe example in each panel with a screenshot image using Mission Act?
- And/or, should we create a CLP Content template ([example Word doc here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fo532_Q9fd5VV_d5E4WVemLDOQANdjJCi-oARStsZ6w/)) which would enable stakeholders to effectively pre-build their CLP in easiest, collaborative way and finalize before the build.

**3. Provide the ability to share a preview of the CLP with internal (VPN) VA stakeholders** DONE, preview works within network. 
- This would support stakeholder review and/or approval before publication
- Use password-protected approach in staging as we are doing with Mission Act now
-
***Priority 2's - for v. 1.0 of CLP***

**4. Add a Newsletter Sign-up feature as an optional Panel or optional component within a Panel**
- This would have integration to [GovDelivery](https://admin.govdelivery.com/session/new)

**5. Build logic to support alternating blue/white background**
- This to improve appeal and scannability/readability of CLP

**6. Allow CLP to re-order optional Panels**
- This to enable more flexible editorial experience
- Question: Should be able to re-order even the Required Panels

***Priority 3's - Ice Box***

- Allow CMS-managed PDFs in "Downloadable Resources" segment
- Explore implications of allowing the user to make Video a Hero option
- Consider the addition of a **What's on this Page** Table of Contents component in Panel 1 or 2 with hotlinks


See also [CMS team synthesis](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/cms/research/campaign-landing-page/beta-test-synthesis.md) that focus more on editorial experience. 





---------------------------

### User Testing Session 1 - Tim Hudak, VEO

**Product Iteration Themes**

1. Add image of a complete CLP and each Panel in-line as a reference to help contextualize what is being built (Note: Emphasize to user that they can Preview each panel once they Save)
2. Include ability to sort the optional Panels. (Explore implications of allowing the user to make Video a Hero option.)
3. Build-in a "Sign Up for Newsletter" component or Panel with integration to [GovDelivery](https://admin.govdelivery.com/session/new)
4. Make Video authoring experience easier and more flexible
5. Overall, believes the CLP is simple enough -- easier in many ways than TeamSite and existing Blog-creation tool <?> -- that any digital comms staffer could use as is w/o training (both those at the VACO and at the field level).

### User Testing Session 2 - Tanekwa Bournes, VBA

**Product Iteration Themes**

1. Would like ability to re-arrange the panels
2. Consider the addition of a What's on the Page TOC with hotlinks
3. Make it easier to understand what the user is building -- what's required, what's recommended (maybe a visual example as a popup) -- so user does not keep getting errors as they try to save and preview.

### User Testing Session 3 - Bronwynn Emmet, OPIA

**Product Iteration Themes**

1. Audiences -- by specifying, this could be perceived as exclusionary.   (Note: Should we make this Audience section optional?)
2. Wants the ability to allow users to sign up for newsletter


### User Testing Session 4 - Jessica Austin-Ashley, VHA

**Product Iteration Themes**

1. It would be ideal if we provided a Word doc template that would specify (with visual reference) the content requirements/fields (with character count) for every Panel in the CLP template.  This would allow VA digital comms teams to:
- Develop and refine content (across writers/editors/reviewers) before it is populated into the CLP template via CMS
- Have a visual reference for each panel -- eliminating some of the confusion encountered in the CMS AX
- Enable easy copy-paste in the build, leaving only the addition of  "media" elements -- photos, PDFs, video, events -- as the "complex" task in building a CLP.
2. Would like for the front-end UX to be more colorful -- e.g. go back to the blue-white-blue-white alternating backgrounds for the panels.
3. Would like the ability to share a preview URL to internal VA stakeholders for approval before publish.
