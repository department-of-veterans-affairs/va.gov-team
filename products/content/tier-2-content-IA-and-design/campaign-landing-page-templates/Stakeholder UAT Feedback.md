## CLP Stakeholder Discussion - VBA Stakeholder (Sandy Tadeo)
February 25, 2021

### Question/Answers:
By chance will this presentation be available via a link for as a reference? This is really great! *as a reference? 

What is the image crop size and does the CMS automatically format the photo for you when uploaded?

Questions on images ratios, expansion due to screen aspect ratio.  Interested in how images will need to be prepared in order to share and link.  

This page is for section - Concern is limit to only three audiences and wondering will it expand to other audience types?  (Note: We’re only rolling this out to VACO partners). 

Hero page top link - can we change this as a primary call to action.

Can they move panels around?  ‘No modularization of panels’

Can we include video in the first three sections.  Video panel is on the 4th panel and can’t currently move up to a higher order. 

I’m wondering if the Collab review might be too much oversight/overhead for these teams (as a sense).  They are looking for something like a Drupal baseline, pushed back on publishing timeline and collab cycle element.  

Campaign length is a stinking point - They have a lot of weekly and biweekly campaigns.  Current lifecycle process:  They is not a solid concrete process the then a carousel process.  

Discussion points:
- Pension Coaching (April) Financial Literacy Month.
- What is each Month theme?  Seasonality of the CLP.

### Thread from Stakeholder Discussion:
#### Topic 1: Images
- Images are currently loaded on the FE wiith their original size, with no cropping or downsizing. url('http://prod.cms.va.gov/sites/default/files/2021-02/Veteran_Gets_Shot_Test%20%28Don%27t%20Use%29.jpg
i think we need to Figure out ideal aspect ratio for FE, and if we have the right image size (instead of just loading the original, which could be 10Mb)
Write better guidance for editors to match that. Answer questions like: Do i need to prepare the image ahead of time? (no! the CMS will let you crop during upload, and it will downsize it for you). What if i want to reuse an image from the media library? (no problem, but you may not be able to control the crop).
- Another thought about images… not raised by VBA folks but before i forget: the FE may want to specify the og:image for URL unfurling, like on social media (or Slack!). It would be a different derivative of the original image, but a different aspect ratio and size (we already support 2:1, which is pretty close to the 1.91 “ideal”).
- The purpose of the “who this is for” is meant to force thinking around the PRIMARY audience. There can be more than one but only one can be primary — and we’re providing some flexibility by allowing up to 3 ‘primary’ audiences.

#### Topic 2: Audiences
- “why only 3 audiences? Solid Start has many more audiences than that!”
do we have enough guidance for this field right now? Does the product guide need to “frontload” the audience strategy or guidance?
- In regards to the image, might be important to show what area would be covered up by the test box prior to uploading or as a selection criteria in support.

#### Topic 3: CTA
- What if i have more than one “primary” CTA, like Solid Start?, which has multiple”
Can we be doing more in the CMS UI to explain the intent of only allowing one CTA? Is that the role of training? Product guide?
- Product guide may also need to indicate SEO impact (or not) .  Perhaps a few pointers on how to select an audience for this field.  Could also be a fillable item in request form for a CLP.

#### Topic 4: Campaign Length / Sunsetting Timline/Process
- Determining campaign length and sunsetting process part of request form?  Details on cross check prior to defined sunset date to ensure relevancy.  Determine redirects and steps to sunset in guide?
- The other aspect that has real power is the seasonality of campaigns i.e. Financial Literacy month, Veterans Day, Fraud Awareness, etc.  Would VA businesses be able to store successful campaigns and restart them (especially after A/B testing or validating high traffic response) with minor tweaks at future dates if desired.  Do we have a repository set up to support the storage of these campaigns?  Is this of value?  (Note: just thinking out load and capturing here for future discussion).
- ^ I always thought that those annual campaigns could just stay out there, and each year, the business updates it with fresh content, new images, new videos, new UTM analytics code. So maybe the page stays out there, but they go through a new collab cycle with the launch of the new 2022 version of contents…?
It’s the one-off’s that probably need retiring/redirecting strategy.
