### 7/13/2020

Content/IA & Business Requirements session to work-through questions about use, authorship, governance, KPIs. Participants included: Jen Lee, Meg Peters, Mikki Northuis, Ryan Thurwell, Mickin Sahni, Kevin Walsh. At the meeting, we fleshed out answers for key questions [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/campaign-landing-page-templates/content-requirements-spec/content_business_rules.md).  John will convert this into a table-formatted requirements document and update the Product Outline to reflect latest thinking.   
  
Next step: 
- John to update [Product Outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/campaign-landing-page-templates) to round-out details about MVP requirements, go-to-market strategy, etc.
- John to shorter follow-up session with the group to walk-through the product plan/details.

### 7/8/2020
- Check-in meeting held with key players from the Platform/Collaboration Cycle, CMS and Public Websites (including Megan Kelly, Kevin Hoffman, Kevin Walsh, Jen Strickland/Trevor Pierce, Mickin Sahni, Mikki Northuis, Ryan Thurwell).   Highlights:
  - Mickin will create a Super Epic that will guide overall work effort.
  - Kevin Walsh and team will soon begin content model work on what he describes as a "rough prototype" for review in about 3-4 weeks; that can be used to test initial hypotheses about CLP. This could be used as the next check-point in the Collab Cycle.  
  - Jen Strickland has been talking to Ryan Thurwell about accessibility questions we will want to address prior to development -- e.g. possibility of leveraging progressive enhancement to manage page load to avoid consuming too much data, etc.   Next step: Jen has asked that we create an Accessibility sub-epic to make sure we capture recommendations.
 
 - IA/Content sync held with Meg Peters and Mikki to share updates on status of project and to surface key questions that would ideally be addressed to inform product requirements and development. John to schedule working sessions in the next two weeks to think through.  A sampling of questions to be addressed:
    - Will new content be created to support CLPs and where will that content sit (directory/URL)?
    - Will a CLP expire or live on?
    - How will we govern when a CLP gets used?
    - Will CLPs sit in a new sub-directory?
    - How will CLPs be found?
 

### 6/25/2020
The CMS team -- led by Kevin Walsh -- has conducted a preliminary scope assessment of the CLP requirements and provided estimates for resource and time commitment (e.g. 4.5 months for one fully-dedicated CMS developer).  That team is recommending the build of a CMS-based feasibility prototype to demonstrate the 80%/20% principle.

### 3/10/2020

Post-initial conversation with Chris Johnston and Dr. Karras-Pilato, meeting set up for 03/23 with Dr. Miller in the OMHSP (Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention) to potentially pilot the CLP template.
