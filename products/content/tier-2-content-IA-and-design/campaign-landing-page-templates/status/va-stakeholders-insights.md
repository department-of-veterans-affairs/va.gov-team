## VA Stakeholders - Campaign Publishing Insights

To better understand how VA Marketing/Communication (MarCom) teams currently manage the production of digital campaigns (to support annual and one-off marketing and engagement initiatives), we will conduct a discovery sprint consisting of stakeholder interviews to capture and synthesize answers to key questions that will help us anticipate various unique use cases and find commonalities.

The goal is to help understand how much rigidity and alternatively flexibility is needed for the following:

- Who gets to use -- everyone at any time, or is access per request?
- Authoring governance - e.g. will their be tiers of access per user account?
- URL-configuration -- e.g. https://www.va.gov/health-care/campaign/reach or https://www.va.gov/campaign/reach (note: Many campaigns will have vanity URLs redirects -- e.g. va.gov/reach 
- Lifecycle of CLP (e.g. does it ever expire/get deleted?)

| Questions | VA Stakeholders | VA PO |
|--|--|--|
|How many campaigns a year? | **VBA/Sandy Tadeo:** It depends, we usually build a campaign (landing) page when there’s a new initiative like the banking program (VBBP) or the VA Solid Start (VASS). These are mostly projects that VBA leadership initiate, so they are very prominent and we are then tasked to have web presence and social media campaigns around them. We had about 5 in 2019. There are probably other initiatives from business lines that would benefit from having campaign pages, but we just don’t have the bandwidth to extend this capability to them. If they can do it themselves, that’s great. <br> **VHA/Jeff Grandon:** Varies from year to year.  However, we as the VACO Digital Media group will want to authorize/approve any CLPs.| TBD |
|Does a campaign page stay live or expire? | **VBA/Sandy Tadeo:** Almost all of them remain active. I don’t remember taking anything down (so far). One was “archived”, benefits.va.gov/gibill75 – it’s  still active but we’ve already celebrated the GI Bill 75th anniversary 2 years ago, it’s still there for reference. <br> **VHA/Jeff Grandon:** We do archive, even remove/delete some Campaign pages, such as https://missionact.va.gov/ which is a program that is now fully integrated into benefits hubs and will be pulled down at some point -- it's been normalized. Generally, there is no fixed expiration date.  It just becomes a decision at some point. | TBD |
|Should some campaign pages become permanent fixtures of the benefits Hubs – e.g. Blue Water Navy| **VBA/Sandy Tadeo:** Currently, most of them are permanent pages on benefits.va.gov, because they are benefits initiatives (and some were passed by Congress as law, like BWN). I guess I’m not sure when we’ll need to transition an initiative from being a campaign to just a regular page, if necessary. This may be something that you can answer for us, if possible. In addition, I guess we would also need to determine which topics would necessitate having campaign pages (or just a plain ol’ Drupal page). I think it would be beneficial to have some guidelines and best practices when building these campaign pages. <br> **VHA/Jeff Grandon:** The optimal URL structure for a CLP in our view would be va.gov/campaignname -- short, sweet, memorable and marketable in any form: billboard, brochure, PDF, etc.  Yes, we will create vanity URLs with redirects in some cases, but we believe the authority of a va.gov/campaignname will outweigh that consideration in certain cases.  What we'd like to avoid is the va.gov/campaign/be_there SEO optimized link which is so long as to be unmarketable -- forcing us to create a redirect or bitly URL. | TBD |
|When do we utilize CLP versus learning center versus tier 1 content?|  N/A | The distinction between a CLP and Resource & Support content is outlined below.|
|How are URLs determined?| Some CLP-like pages have been set up as subdomains -- e.g. https://missionact.va.gov/ |

## How To Differentiate Content Tiers

| Tier 1-2-3 Content | Resources & Support | Campaign Landing Page |
|--|--|--|
|- **Tier 1 Content** - Benefit content and tools (applying for benefits, accessing benefit tools to manage your existing benefits) for beneficiaries, including Veterans, family members, service members.  Goal of Tier 1/Benefit Hub content is to get people to enroll in a benefit or manage their benefit online.<br> - **Tier 2 Content** - Benefit-adjacent content (for beneficiaries, and people who work with beneficiaries) <br> - **Tier 3 Content** - Organizational/administrative/office content | Resources & Support is reserved for Tier 2 Content that includes benefit learning, knowledge, help, and support content categories.  Goal of Resources & Support is to answer Veteran's benefit-related questions.| A Campaign Landing page is reserved for Tier 2 content that is more similar to marketing or engagement content.  Use cases for a campaign landing page include <br> - Veteran "awareness" public information campaigns - e.g.,Veterans wear your mask campaign, Veterans get your flu shot campaign, VHA covid 19 research recruitment campaign <br> - It may also have audiences other than Veterans (for example: local governments, Congress, VSOs, medical researchers). <br> - It may also be time based in nature, like a particular campaign (#BeThere) or a new legislation change (MISSION Act).


## IA / URL Structure (Proposed Approach)

- Each CLP must have a unique URL for tracking/analytics purposes
- Some CLP-like pages have been set up as subdomains -- e.g.
  - https://missionact.va.gov/ 
- Some CLPs have "vanity" redirects -- e.g. bethere.gov

- Proposed: All Campaign Landing Pages would fall under the More Resources section of each Benefit hub.  Rationale: Only CLPs that 

  - Health care - https://www.va.gov/health-care/
    - Example: https://www.va.gov/health-care/covid-19-vaccine/stay-informed
    - Example: https://missionact.va.gov/  (For VA.gov version CLP: https://www.va.gov/health-care/mission-act)
    - Example: https://www.veteranscrisisline.net/support/be-there (For VA.gov version CLP: https://www.va.gov/health-care/be-there)
  - Disability - https://www.va.gov/disability/
  - Education - https://www.va.gov/education/
  - Careers and Employment - https://www.va.gov/careers-employment/
  - Pension - https://www.va.gov/pension/
  - Housing Assistance - https://www.va.gov/housing-assistance/
  - Life Insurance - https://www.va.gov/life-insurance/
  - Burials & Memorials - https://www.va.gov/burials-memorials/
  
  
 
- We need to determine what to do about CLPs that originate from VA business lines that are not currently part of the VA.gov site structure.  Examples:

  - Community Care - https://www.va.gov/communitycare/
    - Example: https://www.va.gov/communitycare/flu-shot
  - Office of Transition and Economic Assistance
    - Example: https://benefits.va.gov/transition/solid-start.asp
  - New Veteran initiatives -- e.g, Office of Women's Health (https://www.stripes.com/news/us/sweeping-veterans-bill-becomes-law-impacting-every-corner-of-the-community-1.657643)
