## User Problem Statement
**How do we ensure that helpful, relevant tier 2 information that supports tier 1 benefit content is accessible and findable in the new VA.gov site experience, AND does not dilute, distract, and clutter Veterans' benefit product UX?**

The tier 1 Veteran-first benefit hubs are nearly complete migrating legacy content. But there's still a tremendous amount of legacy content that hasn't been brought into the new VA.gov site experience. In order to prioritize content, and so that we don't migrate everything into the benefit hubs--and thereby devolve into the old legacy site experience--the WBC team created a tiered content framework. 

- Tier 1 content: benefit content and tools (applying for benefits, accessing benefit tools to manage your existing benefits) for beneficiaries (Veterans, family members, service members) 
- Tier 2 content: benefit-adjacent content (for beneficiaries, and people who work with beneficiaries)
- Tier 3 content: organizational/administrative/office content

This product focuses on creating an IA and content design for tier 2 content. 


## User Goals
- Beneficiaries: Easily find and get to relevant, related information that helps me better understand how my benefit works; or better use my benefit; or take advantage of non-benefit program resources or services. 
- Non-beneficiaries (like VSOs, school counselors, etc.): Easily find and get to relevant, related information that helps me better do my job to support/help VA beneficiaries, be they Veteran students in college or caregivers of older Veterans, etc. 


## Business Goals
- Provide a way of incorporating the many benefit-adjacent tier 2 content (from the legacy TeamSite VA.gov) into the new VA.gov 
- Maintain prioritization of Veteran-focused tier 1 benefit content, so benefit hubs continue to provide essential benefit info and access to digital tools


## Assumptions
- That a lot of legacy TeamSite benefit-adjacent content is what we might think of as "more resources," "learning," "knowledge," or "benefit-related engagement" information
- That some of the content that VA business lines call or think of as "benefit" is actually this tier 2 benefit-adjacent "resources"/"learning" content
- EX: Free or subsidized rides for Veterans to their VA medical center. VHA's Veteran Transportation Program business may think of this as a benefit, it's in fact an add-on service or resource that varies from city to city, medical center to medical center, and from year-to-year depending on funding and participation of local nonprofits that each medical center might have relationships with. 
- That there are different audiences for tier 2 benefit-adjacent content. Ex: for Veterans and other beneficiaries; and for people who work with Veterans and other beneficiaries (like VSOs or school administrators)
