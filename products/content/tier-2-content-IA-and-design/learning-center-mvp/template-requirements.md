# Learning center template requirements

This is WIP and may evolve based on user research and technical findings.


## Content fields on all learning center pages

- **Required: Breadcrumb** –  pulled from H1, cannot manually customize
- **Required: Search bar** - learning center search or  VA.gov (If user selects VA.gov search, user is taken to the normal site search results where results from all of VA.gov are pulled.)
- ~**TBD: Content type label:** (- tbd -) Article vs. Video (or Media?) or more detailed label like “About,”     “FAQ,” “Step-by-step,” etc. ***first test with no label on pages(but include on the results listing)~
- **Required: H1** – new H1 limit for LC pages – 70 max characters including spaces, rigid in AX
- **Required: [FE topic tags](#fe-topic-tags) and/or [FE audience tags](#fe-audience-tags)** - Note: FE design will combine/flatten topic and audience tags (will no longer display them as separate Topic vs. Audience tags). At least 1 required; up to 4 can be selected for FE display. 
- **See CMS info: [Frontend vs backend tags](#frontend-vs-backend-tags)** 
- **Required: Intro text** – rich text formattable wysiwig – 1,000 characters max including spaces.
- **Required: CTA buttons** – at least 1 required; up to 2; must restrict button text length to 40 characters to prevent wrapping button labels on mobile
- **Optional: On this page TOC links** – When enabled, at least ~3~ 2 H2 sections are required; TOC link text generated by the H2 text.
- **Optional: H2 section header**
- [**Required: Body - content type template**](#specific-lc-content-template-types) (FAQ single, FAQs multiple, Checklist, Step-by-step, About, Image/Video, etc.)
- **Optional: Repeat same CTA button(s)** – Example: User can omit repeat if page is short as in a single FAQ page
- **Required: Need more help** - Email (optional, customizable) + Phone (default pulled from the benefit hub “Ask questions” right rail) + Chatbot link(TBD)
- **Required: Was this helpful** - Backend functionality is still TBD and may not go out with October/Nov MVP. The user action could get collected to Google Analytics - possibly other ideas.
- **Required: Related information** - Custom section can include up to 5 related article links. The link can go to a LC page, a deep benefit detail page, or external. 
- **Required: {label TBD - dedicated VA benefit hub link section}:** Minimum 1 benefit hub cross-link required. The default hub link will be Health Care; the author can change this to any other benefit hub link. Only benefit hub link+teasers will be enabled on this component. Up to 3 benefit hubs can be selected. 
- **Back to top links - ~required if TOC links are enabled:~** ~displays at the end of each H2 section~ Per accessibility feedback, we will create Back to top feature at the FE that's based on page height. 
- **Required: Meta title** - `H1 | Veterans Affairs` format; no character limit, ~no initial caps~. The 70-character-max H1 should automatically be used to generate the meta title. Note: Can we add initial capping logic va the FE template? 
- **Meta description** -- TBD I don't think we need to have meta description for LC, but want to confirm this with engineers and John Hashimoto on what's needed for the kind of structured LC search results display we want. My thinking is we're fine pulling search results display text from the intro text, up to... [TBD] characters max and truncate with ellipses or with "Read more."

## Purpose of tags in the learning center

Tags are not meant to be a substitute search in the learning center, but a way of filtering the ocean into a lake. Content relevance based on keyword-driven search will be the primary way users can quickly find content in the learning center. 

For MVP, we will implement tag filtering by one tag at a time (not combinations of tags or layered search+tag). Future iterations: add other tag labels, based on user data such as what terms users search for most frequently inside the learning center, how users refine search, as well as patterns of common article topics during tier 2 content migrations.


## Frontend vs backend tags

__Frontend (FE) tags - these are the labels that will appear on the article itself__

- These can be a mix of audience and LC homepage 'browse by topic' category tags. 

- For MVP, we will allow a maximum of 4 FE tags. (This # seems high but an article can potentially use up 3 with just All Veterans, Family members, and Service members - this will be rare.) 

__Backend (BE) tags - these are used in the CMS AX and do not display as FE tag labels__

 - These can be a mix of audience and LC homepage 'browse by topic' categories. 
 
 - There must be 1 benefit topic or audience tag that is the "primary" BE tag.  Total BE tags will be limited to a max of 7 for mvp.
 
 - The primary BE tag determines the official 'home' where the article belongs to. 
 
 - Additional 'not primary' BE tags can selected for an article. The additional BE tags will drive other "View all articles about X" landing pages; or which 'articles by X audience' landing pages) that article link can appear as well. I.e., an article can appear under multiple 'view all' lists.
 
 > - Example: The 'How to change your address online' article would live officially under the VA account/profile LC category (primary BE tag). But based on additional BE tags, the article link could show up in the article groupings for the Disability, Health care, Education, and Records 'view all' list of articles. In the FE, the article could show just the VA account/profile tag if no other FE tags were selected.
 
 

## FE tags
We are flattening topic and audience tags in the FE. Up to 4 FE tags can be displayed. The 4 can be a mix of topic and audience. 

By default, the "primary" BE tag should be one of the 4 FE tags -- this gives the author the ability to select 3 more as FE tags.


## FE topic tags

We're separating LC topic tags from the global benefit hub taxonomy. We are also separating Administration info from tags. 

_Note: Benefit hub taxonomy and Administration info will be used in the CMS to inform certain components like the Need more help, but not to create the FE tag experience._ 

This list of FE tags may grow in the future, but it will depend on user data, as well as patterns of frequent article topics during tier 2 content migrations. We may also deprecate FE tags if users don't interact with it as a way to browse content. 

__MVP list of FE topic tags are:__

1. Burials and memorials
2. Careers and employment
3. Decision reviews and appeals 
4. Disability
5. Education and training
6. Health care
7. Housing assistance and home loans
8. Life insurance
9. Pension
10. Records
11. VA account and profile
12. General <--added 7/22: Label TBD. We need some kind of category that's agnostic of benefits and not about your account/profile. These are more general customer issues and sitewide things. IRIS examples: User is having problems opening a PDF link on our site; someone is just looking for general 'contact us' phone number or email. 


~These larger administration topic categories are for content that doesn't fit into one of the neat benefit or service categories above. These were originally incuded in the list of non-beneficiary audience tags, but they're not really audiences; it's meant to signify topic category that's super broad and not a benefit or service.~

~Example: VA fiduciaries is an audience type; they work with Veterans on behalf of VA; they are assigned by VA, and they may span multipiple benefits/services, because they're assigned to the Veteran, not to a benefit/service. So for some `fiduciary` audience topics, the content might have the topic tag `Veterans Benefits Administration.`~

~14.Veterans Benefits Administration~

~15. Veterans Health Administration~

~16. National Cemetery Administration~



## FE audience tags 

Up to 3 total from either the beneficiary **or** non-beneficiary category. Cannot mix beneficiary and non-beneficiary tags. 

For example: 

- You can tag a page with “All Veterans,” (or one of the veteran sub-group tags), and “Family members,” and “Service members.”  
- But not “Women Veterans” and “Lenders, appraisers, and other real estate professionals.”


**Beneficiaries ("you're a Veteran or receive VA benefits"):** 

Up to 3 can be selected, but only 1 from the Veterans list.

- All Veterans - Content author can select the broad category "All Veterans" or one of the sub-Veteran tags:
  - Elderly Veterans [TBD card sort variation test: ~Senior and aging~ Older Veterans / Veterans age 65+] 
  - Former prisoners of war
  - Gulf War Veterans
  - Incarcerated Veterans
  - Korean War Veterans
  - LGBTQ Veterans
  - Minority Veterans
  - Native American Veterans
  - Vietnam War Veterans
  - Women Veterans
  - World War II Veterans
- Family members and caregivers
- Service members



**Non-beneficiaries ("you work with Veterans or with VA"):** 

Up to 3 tags can be selected. 

- Schools, administrators, and other education professionals
- Career counselors and other employment specialists
- Fiduciaries
- Funeral directors and cemeteries
- Lenders, appraisers, and other real estate professionals
- Veteran service organizations and accredited representatives

- ~Clinicians, researchers, and health care workers~  <-- In reviewing the VHA pages, a lot of the subdomain content is so highly specialized, I just don't think they are right candidates to live in the LC. VHA clinical health and research info really does seem like Tier 3 program office content or a special tier 3 subset for the medical audience. Therefore, we will not include the clinicians etc audience as part of the MVP1.1 audience taxonomy. We can add it if we encounter a significant amount of this type of learning center benefit adjacent content during IRIS audit or during next year's tier 3 content work (i.e., if there's tier 2 information mixed in their tier 3 program content.)  8/10


## Administration 

We are separating Administration info from tags. Benefit hub taxonomy and Administration info will be used in the CMS to inform certain components like the Need more help, but not to create the FE tag experience. We may also use Administration for user access/governance, which is still TBD.

- Veterans Benefits Administration

- Veterans Health Administration

- National Cemetery Administration

- Veterans Affairs




## Specific LC content template types

None of these page templates allow featured content (div.feature) components. 

1. ~Single FAQ~ Question and answer

2. Multiple FAQs

3. About

   - Table-based content like rates, contact info, and other multi-dimensional lists. This content type isn't a standalone template, but uses the About template. For the purposes of LC, we will need to improve the existing table component and de-bug for mobile.

4. Step-by-step - modified 'subway map'

5. Media (image/video) – new 

6. Checklist - new
