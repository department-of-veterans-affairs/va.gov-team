# Learning center template requirements

This is WIP and may evolve based on user research and technical findings. [Visual examples - Mural WIP](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1588167553516/2773c854e8ff3a725a5e3ee03272b78e8519f78b)


## Content fields on all learning center pages

- **Required: Breadcrumb** –  pulled from H1, cannot manually customize
- **Required: Search bar** - learning center search or  VA.gov (If user selects VA.gov search, user is taken to the normal site search results where results from all of VA.gov are pulled.)
- **Required: H1** – new H1 limit for LC pages – 70 max characters including spaces, rigid in AX
- **Required: Intro text** – rich text formattable wysiwig – 1,000 characters max including spaces.
- **Optional: Alert component:** reusable/not reusable
- **Required: CTA buttons** – at least 1 required; up to 2; must restrict button text length to 40 characters to prevent wrapping button labels on mobile
- **Optional: On this page TOC links** – When enabled in the CMS by author, at least 2 H2 sections are required; TOC link text generated by the H2 text; FE logic.
- **Optional: H2 section header** - H2s (and other headings) should be hard limited to 70 characters max including spaces
- [**Required: Body - content type template**](#specific-lc-content-template-types) (See section for specific article type specs: FAQ single, FAQs multiple, Checklist, Step-by-step, About, Image/Video, etc.)
- **Optional: Repeat same CTA button(s)** – Example: User can omit repeat if page is short as in a single FAQ page 
- **Required: [Frontend content tags](#frontend-content-tags)** See also [Learning center categories](#learning-center-categories)** 
- **Required: User rating section** - "How do you rate your experience on this page?" (Formerly "Was this page helpful") Backend functionality is TBD Analytics team - GA or Medallia integration.
- **Required: [Related information](#related-information-section)** - freeform list of links and text
- **Required: [VA benefits section](#va-benefits-section)** 
- **Required: [Need more help?](#need-more-help-section)** - This section includes contact info based pre-set list of options
- **Back to top links:**  Per accessibility feedback, we will create Back to top feature at the FE that's based on page height. 

__Not visible fields:__

- **Required: Meta title** - `H1 | Veterans Affairs` format; no character limit, ~no initial caps~. The 70-character-max H1 should automatically be used to generate the meta title. Note: Can we add initial capping logic va the FE template? 
- **[Content type labels:](#content-type-labels)** - Note: Content type label will be used only on search results, and not on the articles themselves.
- ~**~Required~ TBD: [Administration taxonomy](#administration-taxonomy)** We may need administration info for AX governance - tbd. We are not using administration info for any component logic.



## Content type labels
The content type (or template) label will be used only on __listings for search results__ pages;  __all-articles-in-X__ landing pages; and __articles-tagged-y__ landing pages. They are not used on the articles themselves. Rationale: We tested with them showing in the listings and users found them useful on results/landing pages. We did not include them in the article pages and no one missed them or was confused without them.

## Purpose of tags in the learning center

Tags are not meant to be a substitute search in the learning center, but a way of filtering the ocean into a lake. Content relevance based on keyword-driven search will be the primary way users can quickly find content in the learning center. 

For MVP, we will implement tag filtering by one tag at a time (not combinations of tags or layered search+tag). Future iterations: add other tag labels, based on user data such as what terms users search for most frequently inside the learning center, how users refine search, as well as patterns of common article topics during tier 2 content migrations.


## Frontend content tags

Content tags will be created in the future be based on user search queries, call center data, as well as patterns of frequent article topics during tier 2 content migrations. We may also deprecate content tags if users don't use them over time. 

- FE content tags can be a mix of audience and content topic or themes. 
- At least 1 tag (audience label) is required. This will drive the 'articles by audience' landing pages in the LC. 
- A maximum of 4 FE content tags allowed.
- Content tags are separate and different from LC categories, which are very high level organizing buckets. 

EXAMPLE:
An article called "Can I get a service dog through VA?" 
- this article might live in the primary LC category called Disability. 
- the article itself might be tagged with "service dogs" and "all Veterans." 
- if the user clicks on "service dogs" tag, they would go to a landing page with all/any articles tagged with that content theme, not just disability articles about service dogs -- i.e., health care category article about service dogs, a service dog article for fiduciaries, etc. 


### Audience labels for FE tags

Authors can select 1 beneficiary **or** 1 non-beneficiary audience. 

**Beneficiaries ("you're a Veteran or receive VA benefits"):** 

- All Veterans 
- Veterans age 65+ with complex care needs <-- TBD card sort
- Former prisoners of war
- Gulf War Veterans
- Incarcerated Veterans
- Korean War Veterans
- LGBTQ Veterans
- Minority Veterans
- Native American Veterans
- Vietnam War Veterans
- Women Veterans
- World War II Veterans
- Family members and caregivers
- Service members


**Non-beneficiaries ("you work with Veterans or with VA"):** 

- Schools, administrators, and other education professionals
- Career counselors and other employment specialists
- Fiduciaries
- Funeral directors and cemeteries
- Lenders, appraisers, and other real estate professionals
- Veteran service organizations and accredited representatives



## Learning center categories
These were formerly called "BE/backend tags." For clarity - to not conflate them with FE content tags - we will refer to these as "learning center categories." 

__Learning center categories are:__

1. Burials and memorials
2. Careers and employment
3. Decision reviews and appeals 
4. Disability
5. Education and training
6. Health care
7. Housing assistance and home loans
8. Life insurance
9. Pension
10. Records
11. VA account and profile  (MVP 1.0)
12. Other topics and questions (MVP 1.0)

__CMS driven logic:__
- There must be 1 primary LC category selected. (IF we display the category in the breadcrumb or url, the primary category will be used there.)
- Optional: Author can select 6 additional 'other' categories. These 'other' categories will be used to cross-link the article from those other category landing pages.

EXAMPLE: 
- The 'How to change your address online' article would live officially under the VA account/profile LC category (primary BE tag). 
- But we can select additional 'other' categories such as Disability, Health care, Education, and Records, so that the 'How to change your address online' article would be listed on the'view all articles in X' landing page for all of those categories. 
- In the FE UX, the article would just show VA account/profile as the category in the breadcrumb. 

~## Frontend vs backend tags~

__~Frontend (FE) tags - these are the labels that will appear on the article itself~__

- ~These can be a mix of audience and LC homepage 'browse by topic' category tags.~

- ~For MVP, we will allow a maximum of 4 FE tags. (This # seems high but an article can potentially use up 3 with just All Veterans, Family members, and Service members - this will be rare.)~ 

__~Backend (BE) tags - these are used in the CMS AX and do not display as FE tag labels~__

 - ~These can be a mix of audience and LC homepage 'browse by topic' categories.~ 
 
 - ~There must be 1 benefit topic or audience tag that is the "primary" BE tag.  Total BE tags will be limited to a max of 7 for mvp.~
 
 - ~The primary BE tag determines the official 'home' where the article belongs to.~ 
 
 - ~Additional 'not primary' BE tags can selected for an article. The additional BE tags will drive other "View all articles about X" landing pages; or which 'articles by X audience' landing pages) that article link can appear as well. I.e., an article can appear under multiple 'view all' lists.~
 
 > - ~Example: The 'How to change your address online' article would live officially under the VA account/profile LC category (primary BE tag). But based on additional BE tags, the article link could show up in the article groupings for the Disability, Health care, Education, and Records 'view all' list of articles. In the FE, the article could show just the VA account/profile tag if no other FE tags were selected.~
 
 

## ~FE tags~
~We are flattening topic and audience tags in the FE. Up to 4 FE tags can be displayed. The 4 can be a mix of topic and audience. Only 1 audience tag allowed.~ 

~The FE tags do not need to match the BE categories. ~By default, the "primary" BE tag should be one of the 4 FE tags~ -- ~this gives the author the ability to select 3 more as FE tags.~


## ~FE topic tags~

~We're separating LC topic tags from the global benefit hub taxonomy. We are also separating Administration info from tags.~ 

~This list of FE tags may grow in the future, but it will depend on user data, as well as patterns of frequent article topics during tier 2 content migrations. We may also deprecate FE tags if users don't interact with it as a way to browse content.~ 

__~MVP list of FE topic tags are:~__

1. ~Burials and memorials~
2. ~Careers and employment~
3. ~Decision reviews and appeals~ 
4. ~Disability~
5. ~Education and training~
6. ~Health care~
7. ~Housing assistance and home loans~
8. ~Life insurance~
9. ~Pension~
10. ~Records~
11. ~VA account and profile~
12. ~Other topics and questions~ <--Label TBD card sort 


## Administration taxonomy

~We are separating Administration info from tags. Benefit hub taxonomy and Administration info will be used in the CMS to inform certain components like the [Need more help? section](#need-more-help-section), but not to create the FE tag experience.~ 

We may ~also~ use Administration for user access/governance, which is still TBD. We are not using Administration data to inform any of the component logic.


__Administrations:__

- Veterans Benefits Administration

- Veterans Health Administration

- National Cemetery Administration

- Veterans Affairs


## Specific LC content template types

None of these page templates allow featured content (div.feature) components. 

1. Question and answer

2. Multiple FAQs

3. About

   - Table-based content like rates, contact info, and other multi-dimensional lists. This content type isn't a standalone template, but uses the About template. For the purposes of LC, we will need to improve the existing table component and de-bug for mobile.

4. Step-by-step - modified 'subway map'

5. Media (image/video) – new 
- Images
- Videos

6. Checklist - new
