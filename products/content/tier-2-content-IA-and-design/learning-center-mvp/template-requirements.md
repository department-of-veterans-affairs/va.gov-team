## Content fields on all learning center pages

- **Required: Breadcrumb** –  pulled from H1, cannot manually customize
- **Required: Search bar** - learning center search or  VA.gov (If user selects VA.gov search, user is taken to the normal site search results where results from all of VA.gov are pulled.)
- **TBD: Content type label:** (- tbd -) Article vs. Video (or Media?) or more detailed label like “About,”     “FAQ,” “Step-by-step,” etc. ***first test with no label on pages(but include on the results listing)

- **Required: Intro text** – rich text formattable wysiwig – 1,000 characters max including spaces.

- **Required: Was this helpful**
- **Required: Related information**  (minimum 1 benefit cross-link required which  is dynamically generated based on the benefit topic tag; pulled from the hub teaser text component used on the homepage. An additional 4 links can be custom added, for a max of 5 total.)

## Purpose of tags in the learning center

Tags are not meant to be a substitute search in the learning center, but a way of filtering the ocean into a lake. Content relevance based on keyword-driven search will be the primary way users can quickly find content in the learning center. 

For MVP, we will implement tag filtering by one tag at a time (not combinations of tags or layered search+tag). Future iterations should consider making tags work in a more sophisticated way, based on user data including what terms users search for most frequently inside the learning center.



## Topic tags 

Topic tags are based on VA.gov benefit hub categories, plus a new category called "VA account and profile." Topic tags don't include "service members" and "family members," because they're covered by the `Audience ` tags. RE how many topic tags to allow - this is TBD. Many VA content authors tend to select things even when it's distantly and irrelevantly related to a thing. (Keywords for forms are an example - where form owners add "health care" as a keyword even to vocational counseling and employee retirement forms. So governance is a concern and potentially enabling white noise/chaos/uselessness through abuse/misuse.)

At minimum - 1 primary topic tag will be required. This will also drive the minumum required 1 'related benefit hub' link in the `Related information` section. _TBD how many total topic tags allowed._ 

1. Burials and memorials
2. Careers and employment
3. Decision reviews {added 7/20}
4. Disability
4. Education and training
5. Health care
6. Housing assistance
7. Life insurance
8. Pension
9. Records
10. VA account and profile

These larger administration topic categories are for content that doesn't fit into one of the neat benefit or service categories above. These were originally incuded in the list of non-beneficiary audience tags, but they're not really audiences; it's meant to signify topic category that's super broad and not a benefit or service. 

Example: VA fiduciaries is an audience type; they work with Veterans on behalf of VA; they are assigned by VA, and they may span multipiple benefits/services, because they're assigned to the Veteran, not to a benefit/service. So for some `fiduciary` audience topics, the content might have the topic tag `Veterans Benefits Administration.`

11. Other?
- Veterans Benefits Administration
- Veterans Health Administration
- National Cemetery Administration





## Audience tags 

Up to 3 total from either the beneficiary **or** non-beneficiary category. Cannot mix beneficiary and non-beneficiary tags. 

For example: 

- You can tag a page with “Veterans,” (or one of the veteran sub-group tags), and“Family members and caregivers,” and “Service members.”  
- But not “Women Veterans” and “Lenders, appraisers, and other real estate professionals.”




**Beneficiaries ("you're a Veteran or receive VA benefits"):** 

Up to 3 can be selected, but only 1 from the Veterans list.

- Veterans - Content author can select the broad category "Veterans" or one of the sub-Veteran tags:
  - Elderly Veterans
  - Former prisoners of war
  - Gulf War Veterans
  - Incarcerated Veterans
  - Korean War Veterans
  - LGBTQ Veterans
  - Minority Veterans
  - Native American Veterans
  - Vietnam War Veterans
  - Women Veterans
  - World War II Veterans
- Family members and caregivers
- Service members



**Non-beneficiaries ("you work with Veterans or with VA"):** 

Up to 3 tags can be selected. 

- Schools, administrators, and other education professionals
- Career counselors and other employment specialists
- Fiduciaries
- Funeral directors and cemeteries
- Lenders, appraisers, and other real estate professionals
- Veteran service organizations and accredited representatives
- Clinicians, researchers, and health care workers

## Specific LC content template types

None of these page templates allow featured content (div.feature) components. 

1. Single FAQ

   - Table-based content like rates, contact info, and other multi-dimensional lists. This content type isn't a standalone template, but uses the About template. For the purposes of LC, we will need to improve the existing table component and de-bug for mobile.

4. Step-by-step - modified 'subway map'

5. Media (image/video) – new 

6. Checklist - new
