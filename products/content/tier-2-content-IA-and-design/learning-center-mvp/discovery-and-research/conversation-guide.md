## Intro - 3 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Liz Lantz and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes.  We have a team working on a new web product on VA.gov that will help you find answers to questions about VA benefits and services, and your VA.gov account.  Today, I'd like to hear about your experience getting questions answered, and go through a prototype of this new web product and get your thoughts on it.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, I want to hear your honest opinions.** I'm not testing your ability, and there are no right or wrong answers. Our team wants to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your honest feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype.** It may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. None of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **I'd like to I record my screen and audio as we talk today, if that's alright with you.** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. Are you comfortable with me recording screen and audio for our session?
  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I've started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Before we look at the prototype, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

- I understand you have benefits with the VA or an online account with the VA. Can you remember a time you had a question about you benefits or VA account? 
- What was that question about? 
- What was the first step you took to get that answered? 
- Did you have to take additional steps beyond that to get the answers you needed?
- What has your experience been like trying to answer those questions on VA.gov?
- Tell me about the last time you visited a VA website. What were you doing?
- Was that a typical experience for you?
- Okay, thanks for sharing that. Just a couple more questions before we start getting into the prototype. 
  - If you saw a section of VA.gov called "Learning Center", what kinds of things would you expect to see there?
  - Imagine you recently moved and you need to make sure VA has your new address.  How would you do that?
- That's really helpful to know. Let's get into that prototype!

### Things to watch for

- What has happened in the past when they've tried to answer questions on our website?  
- Might they have familiarity with the benefit hubs already?
- Do they default to google? Or site search?  Calling someone?  
- What do veterans think is in a “learning center”?

## Task 1: General impression - 5 minutes

- Okay, thank you for explaining that to me.  Now I'm going to have you share your screen, and then I'll send you a link to a prototype so we can look at that together. 
  - *Use chat to send user link to prototype, starting on home page of learning center.* https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/YJXZTKC6CN4
  - *Talk user through screen sharing so they can share their screen.*
- Take a look at this page, scroll around. Tell me what this page is for and what you think you can do here. It'll be really helpful if you can think out loud as much as possible moving forward.  
- What do you think about the different ways you can find information on this page? 

*If participant hasn't commented on these items on their own, ask:*

- Do you think name `Learning Center` makes sense for what you expected? 
- What did you notice about the search?
- How do you think this is different from the site search in the navigation?

### Things to watch for

- What was the participants initial response to the page?
- What did they say about the name "Learning center"?

## Task 2:  Find article on a specific topic - 5 minutes 

- Going back to that scenario from earlier - imagine you recently moved and you need to make sure VA has your new address. Please show me what you would normally do and continue to think out loud as you do so.

- Since this is a prototype, not everything will work as you might expect, but it'll be very helpful to hear and see how you'd interact with it if it were a live website.

- Take a look at this page, and tell me how you'd make sure VA has your new address. Think out loud. 

  *`View all VA account and profile articles` link is a clickable hotspot*

  *Allow participant to go through entire page before prompting them to click.*

*If participant hasn't commented on these items on their own, ask:*

- What are your impressions of how the page is organized? 

*If participant would only use search:*

- Is there another way besides search that you'd try to find this information?

*If participant doesn't find hotspot:* 

- Have you noticed any place you can click? No problem. For the purpose. Of this prototype - see the `View all VA Account and profile articles` link? Go ahead and click that.

### Things to watch for

- Did the participant notice the search bar?
- What were the participant's comments on the `Search` radio buttons above the search bar?
- Do users notice or get confused between the search link in the top nav (which opens to a search box) and the in-page search with the radio buttons?
- Participant reaction to audience and topic tags and content?
- Did the participant decide to look up information on the topic by searching or scanning the page links?

## Task 3: Review topic results - 3 minutes

*Participant will be looking at the `View all VA account and profile articles` result screen.*

- Ok great! Now again, scroll around, and go ahead and talk me through what you see on this page and what you can do here. 

- How does this line up with what you expected?

- Would any of these articles help you figure out how to make sure VA had your new address?

  *Prototype has three clickable results: `Change your address on file w/ the VA`, `Sign in FAQs`or `How to change your address online`*

- What helped you determine that article was the right one for you?

- Great, go ahead and click and see if you can find the info you're looking for.

### Things to watch for

- Is the format of each search result helpful, or is a link farm more appropriate?
- Is the format of the topic articles results page sufficient and helpful to the participant?
- What were the participant's comments, if any, on the topic and audience tags for each result?
- Do the template labels help the user choose the most relevant article to their search?

## Task 4: Navigate between learning center articles - 5 minutes

*Participant should be on `Change your address on file w/ the VA`, `Sign in FAQs`or `How to change your address online` article*

- Go ahead and talk me through what you see on this page and what you can do here. 

- Does this page in answer your question?

- Based on this article, what would you do next?

  *Encourage participant to click on hotspot if they have not done so already*. 

  - *On How to change address online page, hotspot is in alert, and to related info section at bottom of page*

  - *On Change address on file page, hotspot is in body text*

  - *Sign in FAQs page, hotspot is in to related info section at bottom of page*

    

*Once on new page:*

- How does this line up with what you expected?
- Excellent, you're being really helpful. Thank you. Just a few more things to go over.

### Things to watch for

- Did the participant get confused navigating between articles?
- How did the experience align with participant's expectations?

## Task 5: Navigating between topics, and between Hub and Learning Center - 5 minutes

*Participant should still be on `Change your address on file w/ the VA`, `Sign in FAQs`or `How to change your address online` article*

- We're going to shift gears now. Imagine you need to find out how to get compensation for a Veteran who has been exposed to Agent Orange. How would you do that from here?

  *May need to remind user that things might not work as expected since this is a prototype*

- Thanks for sharing that. Since this is a prototype, we don't have all of that set up, so I'm going to send you a link you directly to a page. 
  
  

*Send participant link to Exposure to hazardous chemicals page in prototype*: https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/YJXZTKC6CN4#/screens/424624543

- Now again, scroll around, and take a look at this page. Please continue to think out loud - you're doing a great job with that.
- How does this line up with what you expected to see? Okay, that's good to know. Go ahead and see if you can find the information you're looking for anywhere.



*This should take participant to LC Agent Orange article*

- Now, how does this line up with what you expected?

- Based on this information, what would you do next?

  *Encourage participant to click CTA to go to Learn How to File Claim*

- And, once again, how does this page line up with what you expected to find? 

### Things to watch for

- How does user expect to be able to get to unrelated topic information?
- Did the participant navigate easily between the benefit hub and learning center?
- Did the participant get confused at any point going back and forth?
- What changes did the participant notice between LC and hub?

## Task 6: Review tag results -  3 minutes

- Great, thank you! We're almost done.  One more thing I'd like to get your feedback on. Can you please go back to the Agent Orange page we were just looking at? 

- From here, show me how would you find more articles that might be of interest to the same group of readers.

  *If participant doesn't click on audience tag*. 

  - Did you notice the audience and topic labels?
  - What would you expect to happen if you clicked on one?
  - Go ahead and click on the audience label.

*User lands on Learning center articles tagged: Vietnam War Veterans page.*

- Great! Take a look at this page. How does it align with what you'd expect? 
- What do you think about how this information is presented?
- *If participant doesn't comment on tags:*
  - Are there any aspects to the page that you think are interactive?
  - What would you expect if you click on one of the audience or topic tags?
  - Did you notice any articles that sound like they could be the same?
  - What differences do you notice between them?

### Things to watch for

- Did the participant realize the topic and audience tags were clickable?
- If not, why not?
- What did they think the tags would do?
- Are the tag results useful?
- Is the format helpful to the participant?

## Post-Task Interview - 8 minutes

Excellent, this has all been so helpful. Just a few more questions for you before we wrap up.  

- From this screen, talk me through how you would apply for a benefit you don't already have - education, home loan, something like that.

- Got it, thanks. That's helpful. From what you've seen today, can you describe how the learning center is different from overall site search?
  - If they didn't address the radio buttons above the search bar, get their perspective on that.
- We don't know what to call the product you reviewed yet. Now that you have a better idea of the kinds of information that's here, what you think of the name `Learning Center`?
- Say you went to VA.gov today and knew we had launched this product. How would you find it on the website?
- Overall, what, if anything, do you find valuable or not helpful about this learning center concept as a whole?
- What do you think could be improved about what we've reviewed today?
- Any questions for me? 

## Thank-You and Closing - 1 minute

Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
