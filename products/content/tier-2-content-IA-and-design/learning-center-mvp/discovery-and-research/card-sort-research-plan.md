# Research Plan for Learning Center MVP:  Card Sort

**---- DRAFT ----**



Liz Lantz, Public Websites, July 2020

## Goals

The goal of this study is to evaluate the nomenclature for the Learning Center audience and topic labels, and see how those labels are applied to articles by Veterans and VA content authors.

**Research questions**

- How does the nomenclature resonate with our participants?
- How will participants apply the audience and topic labels to articles?
- Have we missed, or mis-labeled, any significant audiences or topics?

**Hypothesis**

- Topic labels will be consistently applied to articles by both participant groups. 
- Veterans and VA content authors will apply audience labels differently.
- Participants will create their own labels, (especially for audience) but they will not consistently create the same new labels.

## Method

We will be creating 2 hybrid, unmoderated studies using OptimalSort (links below):

1. One to evaluate topic labels
2. One to evaluate audience labels

Each study will contain article titles as the cards, and the labels as the categories. 

In order to keep data separate for our 2 participant groups, we'll duplicate each study to generate a link for Veteran participants, and a separate link for VA content author participants.

## Participants and Recruitment

We will recruit 30-60 Veterans participants who meet the [same criteria specified for our usability study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/learning-center-mvp/discovery-and-research/usability-study-research-plan.md#participants-and-recruitment).

**Recruitment strategy** 

- We will use the Perigean contract to recruit Veterans using [this email template.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/learning-center-mvp/discovery-and-research/card-sort-recruit-email.md)
- We will work with our web contacts across VA business offices to recruit the appropriate VA content authors via email.

## When?

The link for the card sort will be shared out during the week of **TBD**. The card sorting exercise should take participants 10-20 minutes to complete.

The card sort link will be tested by a member of the Public Websites team prior to sending it out.

## Team Roles

Since this is an unmoderated study, there will be no team members present for the sessions. Plan and study created by Liz Lantz, liz.lantz@adhocteam.us
