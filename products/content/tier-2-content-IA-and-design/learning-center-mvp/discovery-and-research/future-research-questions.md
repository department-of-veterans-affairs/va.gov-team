# Outstanding research questions for resources and support

## General
- I think it'd be useful to revisit all of our [original research questions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/learning-center-mvp/discovery-and-research/learning-center-mvp-findings-summary.md#research-questions) through an unmoderated study.
- Re-evaluate the ease of navigating between the learning center and benefit hub
- To ensure we are meeting the needs of Veterans using non-laptop or desktop devices, we should test mobile versions of our designs. 
- We should make to include users using assistive technology.

## Tables
- How are content authors using them? 
- Are Veterans encountering any usability issues? 
- Do we need a comparison table option?  ([early iterations/explorations in mural](https://app.mural.co/t/vsa8243/m/vsa8243/1599058756286/389fe124296d14b2ceee7ea532497e8e12c3aaad))
- How are the breakpoints working out?

## Search
- How do people use search now that it's live (vs the prototype)?
- Are any usability issues encountered when using the `all of va.gov` option?

## Homepage
- Does the audience/topics treatment create any usability issues, especially on mobile?
