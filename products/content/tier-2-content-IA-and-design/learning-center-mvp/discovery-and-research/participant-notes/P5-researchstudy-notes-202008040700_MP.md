7:00 am

*Highlights:* 

* uses eBenefits a lot, helps others
* thought the links on the LC hp were chat rooms
* didn’t think it was that diff from VA.gov, info-wise (initially) 
* what expect in LC: How you would look for info. Like info on buying a home, trying to figure out your benefits. “Healthcare, how to maneuver around on the website.”
* would go back to LC hp to get to another article — kept looking on the search results for changing address
* said thought topic and audience buttons were clickable before
* kept mentioning that ppl who are older don’t use computer
* knew to go to Disability for Agent Orange
* liked breakdown of if you’re eligible in Agent Orange content
* to get another benefit, would click VBA topic link from search results  
* understood that LC is within VA.gov
 * “If you search VA.gov, you would go to the home screen, the main screen.”
* perception that the LC explains everything 
* to find LC, would type LC in the main VA.gov search — but I would not necessarily know it’s called that
* VA needs to promote, tell ppl about this info or it will not be successful 

*Intro…*
*I understand you have benefits with the VA or an online account with the VA. Can you remember a time you had a question about your benefits or VA account?*

> My online acct - yes, bc when I moved about a year and half ago, had to chg my address. Problems getting my meds bc my address was wrong in VA’s system. Thought I had chgd my address everywhere I needed to. MyVA Health and eBenes.

*What was that question about?*

> See ^

*What was the first step you took to get that answered?*

> Called 800 number. No, actually tried to figure it out myself online. What I was looking at online showed me I changed my address, so I cd not fig out the problem. Went to e Benes. Going there is fine. I have been on it prob as long as it’s been in existence. 

> I was confused as to why my address was not changed. I thought I knew eBenefits well; thought I was savvy.

*Did you have to take additional steps beyond that to get the answers you needed?*

> Called 800 number. “I have to have a serious issue to call the 800 number.”

*What has your experience been like trying to answer those questions on VA.gov?*

> She said she mainly uses eBenefits. Knows it well, is good at finding answers. 

*Tell me about the last time you visited a VA website. What were you doing?*

> Took COVID-19 test. Was sick. Went to the place (med). They used my Tai-Care instead of billing. I had to go on the VA website to find the form to get reimbursed. I also went on there to pull up the form I needed. Bc I knew I wd prob need documentation to show them I have this benefit. Even tho it says on clinic door that they take Vets, they need more info, papers. 

> It didn’t work, how I tried to prepare ahead of time. 

> I had to get a piece of paper that has numbers, references the program I belong to. So there were 2 things:

* Go to clinic
* Get form to be reimbursed 

*Was that a typical experience for you?*

> Yes. When I am doing something related to my benes, I go to VA.gov. 

> Go to VA.gov to get info, forms bc there is a lot of fake stuff on Internet. 

> I am pretty computer savvy. I help ppl with their benefits.

> She said she knows eBenefits well. 

*Prototype…*
   [https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/YJXZTKC6CN4](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/YJXZTKC6CN4) 

*If you saw a section of VA.gov called “Learning Center”, what kinds of things would you expect to see there?*

> How you would move around to get information. Sort like how there is a menu on any website as it is. If you were looking for info like purchasing a home, figuring out your benefits. Healthcare, how to maneuver around on the website.

*Looking at the prototype — what is this page for? What can you do?* 



> Learning Center benefits…”

> Scrolling, reading. 

> “I don’t think that it’s that much diff than what we’re already seeing on VA.gov. They may have changed the titles of the different dialogs … It’s pretty much the same thing.”

> “But these are actual chatting rooms, I think — versus it being information? But still, it seems like the same thing. It's not giving too much more information”

*Your impression about chatting rooms?* 

> I was thinking that if you went into… Say I clicked into create acct and I wanted to chat with someone who had a problem, would help me create an acct. 

> “I think it’s very self-explanatory. I think it breaks it down in easier terms, if somebody had previous had problems getting that information.

What did you notice about the search?

*still on the lower half of the page*

> It has more options than what you have on the current VA.gov site. Sometimes it is hard to get all the info you need in the 5-6 screens. Can I click on one of these? (She’s referring to articles.) Or is it going to make me lose the screen?

*Not everything is clickable, and we will get there in just a minute. Imagine you recently moved and you need to make sure VA has your new address. From here, can you show me how would you do that?*

> When I did it, I went to two different screens. I signed into eBenes, then went into profile to chg address. When I wanted to chg med info, I went into my med account, because it's two different user IDs and passwords that I have for those two accounts, and I went into profile information and tried to chg it there as well — I did chg it.  But again, I don't know why, if there is more than one place you're supposed to put your address.  (2 diff accounts, 2 diff passwords.

> I did not get my meds bc my address did not change. 

*If you had a page like this available to you during this time, where would you have gone to do that?*

> Then I would have went to this health page (goes to health care under topics), Health care > View all health care articles. “I wd click on View All health care articles bc it’s not showing me…” 

(She did not see account info on the LC homepage.) 

 *Go ahead and click on view all acct and profile articles.*
	She is on SERP (search results) page…
	Sees Chg your address for your VA benes right away. 

*How does this line up with what you expected?*

This (article content) seems like it makes it (changing your address) a little easier, giving you the opportunity that you have touched on all the things that need to be updated when you update your file. That it will update your address for all your benefits. 

> Recently realized I cd get on acct from my med acct. (MHV). If you are on your med acct, then go to benefits, it doesn’t look the same. 

*What do you think of how information is formatted?*

> I think it looks better, and it's easier to achieve your goal of getting information because it's more clear than anything else that I've seen before. It has more things all in one, and you don't have to go and search. Like I've said, I've been to two different places where it appears - here I think I'm going to get all the information I need under all one topic.

​	*Clicked on How to chg your VA address online.* 

>  “If this is true, then this is perfect and this is what needed to be in the system to begin with.” “It saves you from having to determine whether or not everything is updated.”

> Recently I changed my direct deposit. I sent the paper in, and they ended up having to call me. 

> This page answers her question. She said, “This page is better than what’s currently being used.”

*How get to another article?* 

> How wd I go back? Scrolled to top. I wd go back to Learning Center. 

*OK, go back.* 

> On LC homepage. Yes, this is what she expected. 

*Let’s go back to the list of articles about changing your address. Imagine you had not navigated away, and you were on the info about updating your address.* 

> Went back to Change your address for your VA benefits. 

*Imagine you wanted to find out how to get compensation for a Vet who has been exposed to Agent Orange.* 

> These are benefits addresses you need to contact the program to change. She is reading thru the page, scrolling up and down,  asked,“So you said to add something to your benefits?”

*We’re going to shift gears now. Imagine you need to find out how to get compensation for a Veteran who has been exposed to Agent Orange. How would you do that from here?*

> I guess you wd go to LC and look for a diff topic. I don’t see how you would get to it from here.

> Back to LC homepage. I wd go to disabilities. 

*Since this is a prototype, we don’t have all of that set up, so I’m going to send you a link you directly to a page.*

/Send participant link to Exposure to hazardous chemicals page in prototype/:   [https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/YJXZTKC6CN4#/screens/424624543](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/YJXZTKC6CN4%22%20%5Cl%20%22/screens/424624543) 

/This should take participant to LC Agent Orange article./
*Now, how does this line up with what you expected?*

> Scrolling slowly. I still don’t see where… I understand that on this website they are breaking down the things that if it’s your situation, this is what qualifies you for benefits… There are diff wars. 

> When I came back from Iraq, I wd just fill out form 4187 and submit it to disability ofc to get paperwork started, to get a doc and see if I qualify. 

> This is a good website bc it breaks it down for Vets who might not be computer savvy. “It breaks it down into conditions that actually affect them.”

> I am not sure what to do next. OK, so you call that number (800 number).

> My next step would be to click on the Agent Orange link. 

> Now looking at the LC page for Agent Orange file a disability claim. 

> This is useful bc it tells you how to file a claim.  This page really goes into detail about what qualifies you. You personally don’t determine if you qualify. VA does. 

> Scrolling back up, past presumptive section. 

*What is your next step?* 

> To file a claim and submit med paperwork from your doc. Then they will mk appt for you to see a VA physician. And you go from there. 

*Go to learn how to file a disability claim.* 

> She clicked button. “I didn’t know anyone did anything in person. I file everything online.” Later: “Who would want to do that?”

> Ok, there is that form. You do it by mail. Where do you click to go online? (She does not see a button for filing claim online.)

*Go back to Agent Orange page — Agent Orange exposure. How wd you find more articles of interest to the same group of readers?*

> Service history requirements - you need to know time period in order to determine if you have Agent Orange. 

> She keeps scrolling in middle of page.

*Please go to top of page. Notice topics and audiences?* 

> Yes, I noticed it when I 1st come to this page. Vietnam Vets are the ones who came into contact with Agent Orange, but some will look to see if they qualify even if they probably don’t.

*What do you expect if you click on one?* 

> For Vietnam War Vets, it would be issue related to Vietnam War. Health care would take me to a place to make appointment. 

> Yes, thought the Audience and Topic buttons were clickable before. 

> She is on SERP page with Agent Orange articles. 
> Did not realize they had free health screening. 

> Ppl who are older won’t use computer. I have to help my mother’s new husband who won’t get on the computer. 

*Have you noticed any articles that sound like they could be the same?*

> *scrolls down.* I don't know for sure.  

Okay. What differences do you notice about how these articles are set up, and the information about them?

> *Hestitates*. I think it tries to give the Vet at much info as poss to determine whether or not they have been exposed + health care and benefits info. 




*Post-Task Interview *
*From this screen, talk me through how you would apply for a benefit you don’t already have - education, home loan, something like that.* 

> Scrolled to bottom. “For any benefit?”

*Yes, for home loan or another bene.*

> You wd go to Vets Benefits Admin (moused over a topic button). You would not go to Blue Water…
>
> *If they didn’t address the radio buttons above the search bar, get their perspective on that.*

*Had you noticed search bar?*

> Yes. 

*What you think the diff options  (for search) wd do?* 

> You would just type in whatever it is that you're looking for.

*Search VA. gov - you see the 2 options? What wd you expect the diff to be between those 2 options?*

> More information. 

*What do you mean by more info?* 

> I would sort of think it’s the same thing. You’re confusing me. The LC was within VA.gov. “It’s just a portion of this website.” 

> “If you search VA.gov, you would go to the home screen, the main screen.”

> I noticed those two there before, but I didn't think about it. When you asked me to explain it, it confused me. VA.gov is VA.gov, it consists of all these different elements. And a part of it is this LC, which is supposed to make everything easier to explain.

*What about the search at top?* 

>  I don’t think it’s anything diff. You would be able to access the info the same way through that search engine.

*We don’t know what to call the product you reviewed yet. Now that you have a better idea of the type of information that’s here, what you think of the name “Learning Center”?*

> “I think it’s perfect. Just call it what it is.” 

*Say you went to VA.gov today and knew we had launched this product. How would you find it on the website?*

> If I knew what it was called, I wd prob type in LC in the search engine, wherever it wd be — within VA.gov. I wd not necessarily know it’s called “LC.”

*Overall, what, if anything, do you find valuable or not helpful about this learning center concept as a whole?*

> It’s helpful. There are some ppl this wd def benefit. I wd not necessarily be one of them, but I don’t know. Occasionally I need to call. If I go online, I just figure it out.

*What do you think could be improved about what we’ve reviewed today?*

> As long as ppl are given this info that says this is how you get this info, they will be successful. If ppl don’t know, they won’t use it and it won’t be successful. 

*Any questions for me?*

> No.
