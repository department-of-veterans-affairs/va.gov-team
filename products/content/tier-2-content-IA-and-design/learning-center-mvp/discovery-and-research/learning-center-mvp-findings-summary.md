View the [Research Plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/learning-center-mvp/discovery-and-research/usability-study-research-plan.md).

## Research Goals 

This study aimed to get feedback from Veterans on the Learning Center MVP concept in order to evaluate whether or not the design supports the following goals:

1. Help Veterans find Tier 2 content in a way that doesn't dilute, distract, and clutter Veterans' benefit top task content and UX.

2. Increase self-service for Veterans, and those who support them, when they have questions about benefits or need to troubleshoot VA account problems.

3. Reduce calls to the call center and the need for in-person visits to VA locations to answer questions about benefits or to troubleshoot VA account problems.

## Research Methodology 

We conducted 45-60 minute remote sessions using Zoom. 

- Each session included a moderator and one participant, and started with a brief warm-up interview.
- Participants used InVision to review a [clickable prototype](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/YJXZTKC6CN4) that contained the learning center homepage, a few articles, a few search results pages, and a benefit hub page.

Participants were asked to review the content under 2 scenarios:

1. Imagine you had recently moved and had to make sure the VA had your new address. How would you do that?
2. Imagine you need to find out how to get compensation for a Veteran who has been exposed to Agent Orange. How would you do that from here (an unrelated learning center article page)?

### Who we talked to

We spoke to 8 Veterans.

-   3 women, 5 men

-   2 participants age 35-44, 3 participants age 55-64, and 2 participants age 65-74. 1 participant did not disclose their age.

-   5 Caucasians, 2 African-Americans, and 1 participant who self-identified as Other.

-   4 participants identified as having cognitive and/or functional disabilities.

-   All had at least one benefit and an account with a va.gov website (eBenefits, MHV, and/or VA.gov).


### Research Questions

- Is the information easy to find using this search-focused, tag-based navigation?
- How easily are people able to navigate between learning center articles, and topics?
- Are the template labels (ex: FAQs, Checklist, About, Step-by-step, etc.) useful?
- What do people see as the difference between the learning center search and overall site search?
- Do people get confused if they click on a content link or CTA button in the learning center and it takes them to a benefit hub page? And vice versa?
- Do people understand that information they don't find in the learning center might be in the benefit hub?
- Where would the most useful place be to provide links to the learning center?

## Key Findings

## Details of Findings

### **The design of the learning center pages makes it easy to navigate and find information for most people.**

The design of the pages reviewed made it easy for people to scan information, and understand next steps. They scanned headings, and then moved on to supporting text (e.g. links under a topic, or description under a search result) to better understand what they were looking at. 

Two people thought the homepage was overwhelming and disorganized during their initial review of the homepage. Yet, as we moved through the session, they could easily find information.

No one got confused when landing on an "articles tagged" page; some people even stated it exceeded their expectations. 

> "It's not quite what I expected - It's cleaner. I"m used to seeing a jumble of links that's hard to understand."

The h1 and intro text helped most participants understand the purpose of the learning center when they initially landed on the homepage, but they quickly scrolled past this section (including search) as the sessions went on. One person commented that the header and intro made it seem like they didn't go to the right place when landing on Articles Tagged: Vietnam War Veterans:

> First off, this thing at the top (*mouses over header and intro text*), you don't even need that. It doesn't even seem like it went where I need to be when I clicked.

![](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/learning-center-mvp/images/articles-tagged-vietnam-vets.png)

*Learning center h1, and intro text remain static on all pages in the prototype.*

**Implications**

- The layout and typography patterns in the current designs will help Veterans search for and find information. 

- We should evaluate whether or not the presentation of links on the homepage is overwhelming in future studies, to determine if this is a larger trend.

- We should consider an alternative approach to the h1 and intro text, for two reasons:

  1. People skipping over the h1 and intro text on every page after the homepage suggests this information is redundant. 

  2. That content will fill the viewport on smaller screens. Depending on scroll position and how we handle page changes with React, it has the potential to make people feel like nothing happened after they click on something.

### The taxonomy seemed to match the mental models of our participants.

The audience and topics categorization on the homepage gave people an easy-to-understand overview of the content in the learning center. When scanning the page, most people read links under the Articles by Audience, and then lingered in the Topics section the rest of the time on the page. 

> It [the layout] makes it very simple and easy for somebody to use, regardless of your age, or how you are associated with the military or the VA."

At various points in the session, we asked *"Show me how you would find..."*. Most people went to the topic area of the homepage and selected the correct benefit category. We know from the [brand consolidation research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/previous-research-review.md#brand-consolidation) that organizing information by benefit matches the Veteran mental model; it makes sense that they gravitated toward information organized by benefit topic, instead looking for information by audience. 

> I like the way that it's broken into different benefits - I think a lot of Veterans don't understand that.

Two people skipped over the `Find Articles by Audience` heading and went straight to the `You're a Veteran` heading. The word "You're" set the expectation for them that clicking the `Show More` button would reveal personalized options for them such as check their claim status, or updating their address. 

On tag results pages (e.g. [Topics Tagged: Vietnam War Veterans](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/2SYENAW6VKT)), participants understood that the content was scoped to that particular tag, and felt it was a helpful way to navigate the site.

> I think it's a very powerful, clean, and helpful presentation of the information.

6 of the 8 people didn't mention the topic and audience tags as something helpful in determining which article to choose on a search results page. The template labels on then results set an expectation of the article format, although there was uncertainty about what a few of them meant ([details on those labels below](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/learning-center-mvp/discovery-and-research/learning-center-mvp-findings-summary.md#template-labels-were-helpful-for-most-people-when-reviewing-a-list-of-articles-but-there-was-ambiguity-about-what-some-labels-meant)).

![](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/learning-center-mvp/images/template-label-and-tags.png)

*Example of template labels and tags.*

**Implications**

- The topic and audience categories in the learning center make sense to Veterans, and organizing information in this way will be helpful to those who browse links instead of performing a search.
- The participant's focus on Topics over Audience suggests that topics should be prioritized over audience on the homepage. However, this could be because the information we asked people to find was very much topic-oriented rather than audience-oriented. We should revisit this in future studies when we have a live environment that will encourage more natural behaviors.
- We should consider updating the copy around the Audience links, possibly by re-enforcing the word `articles` or removing the `You're...`, to minimize confusion that the content is personalized to an individual Veteran. 

### Having to go through multiple resources to get answers to questions is frustrating to Veterans.

Many people shared their previous frustrations at having to navigate multiple VA websites to get answers to questions about their benefits or VA.gov accounts (VA.gov, MHV, or eBenefits). 4 participants shared prior experiences of having to call someone after struggling to find answers online.

> I just gave up at that point, and called the 1-800 number. I didn't want to keep bouncing [between sites].

> The way we perceive it is that the VA is trying to cause us to say "Screw it" that way they won't give us our benefits. They're intentionally trying to make it more difficult for us.

We included articles with similar or identical titles on the search results pages to simulate potential real world situations (different VA business authors creating articles with similar or same H1s). We wanted to see whether or not template labels would help people in this type of use case to determine which article was most relevant for them. While the labels did help 5 participants differentiate, 2 participants were still frustrated and confused by the fact that there were two seemingly identical articles in the first place.

> That can be quite confusing, especially to folks that have TBI [traumatic brain injury] like me. That would be extremely confusing and very frustrating. You're sending us to more places than we need to go.

7 of 8 participants expressed a positive sentiment at the end of the session that they felt the learning center would be an improvement over what exists today, and that there would be a lot of value for Veterans in being able to find information through a searchable, streamlined approach.

> You know the term Rosetta Stone? I think this is strong enough, and organized well enough that it could be that for Veterans.

**Implications**

- The learning center concept is on the right track to improve Veteran self-service, and reduce the frustration they currently experience trying to track down information.
- Duplicative, conflicting, and irrelevant search results will frustrate Veterans. We should implement guardrails to minimize this in the learning center in order to build Veteran trust in the information we're providing them. This will streamline search results, and reduce the cognitive load required to determine which article actually answers their question.

### People perceived that all benefit information would be available in the learning center, and experienced no confusion when going to the benefit hub.

At multiple times during the session, participants were asked where they would find content such as a benefit application or benefit eligibility information (information that's internally classified as `Tier 1` by DSVA). 7 of 8 participants said they would look in the learning center for this information:

- By returning to the home page and browsing links by topic, or 
- By searching with the `Search learning center` radio button selected.

When asked "How would you apply for a benefit you don't already have?" on a learning center article page, 4 of 8 participants expected to find the application via a `View all articles` link in a topic section, and 2 of the 8 participants would use search with the learning center option selected. 

> I'd go back [to learning center home] or I could search the learning center again, and put in "disability benefits" and hit search. 

None of the participants experienced confusion, or noticed a change, when going between the benefit hub and learning center.

**Implications**

- Veterans don't differentiate between the two areas of the site. What matters most is getting their question answered.
- The study suggests that as long as we make it easy for Veterans to find what they're looking for, it won't matter if it lives in the learning center or benefit hub. However,  this should be re-evaluated when we have a live environment that allows people to look for information like they normally would.

### 3 of 8 participants expected the audience and topic tags to be clickable.

Most people didn't comment on the audience and topics tags on the search results or article pages until prompted. Less than half expected the tags to be clickable. 

> It doesn't look like it's clickable. It just looks like this is the audience.

> "Are those viable links? What are you trying to get across with that? How are you trying to guide us?" 

Once they realized they were clickable, and clicked through, 6 of 8 participants felt it aligned with their expectations. 2 participants expected the tags to behave as a layer on top of the Agent Orange content they were viewing.

**Implications**

- We should revisit the design of the tags to make sure people know they're clickable.
- Layering tags to refine results may be useful to people; the question of whether or not the tags were layered has come up internally with team members during design reviews as well. We should explore this for future iterations of the learning center if data indicates that many users want this.

### Template labels were helpful for most people when reviewing a list of articles.

7 of 8 participants noticed the template labels right away when reviewing the search result pages. The labels helped them understand there was a difference between similar sounding articles, and set an expectation for what they might find once they clicked. 

> Video, that's good for people that may not be able to sit and just read.

- `Step by Step` was clear to all participants.
- 3 participants were unsure about the difference between `Question and answer` vs `FAQs` .
- 1 participant wanted to be able to filter results by template labels so they could find only checklists and step-by-step articles.

**Implications**

- Template labels are helpful to Veterans looking at search results.
- We should consider clarifying or combining `Question and answer` and `FAQs` .
- Filtering or sorting by template type to refine results may be useful to Veterans; we should consider exploring this in future versions of the learning center if data indicates that many users want this functionality.

### People understood the search functionality, but the 2 search options caused some confusion.

The search function had two radio buttons above the input: `Search learning center` and `Search VA.gov `. The `Search learning center` input was selected by default. The input was not clickable and people had to talk through what they would do to provide feedback.

![](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/learning-center-mvp/images/search.png)

Everyone understood that the search functionality was keyword based, and expected the `search learning center` radio option would search within the learning center. 

They were less confident about what would happen if they changed the radio option to `search VA.gov` . 7 of 8 participants expected it to conduct a broader search beyond the learning center content (like global site search), but the expectation about the type of content returned in that broader search varied across participants. 

- 4 people's expectations aligned with the intended design. It wasn't clear whether or not they expected to be taken out of the learning center upon conducting the search.

- 3 people expected they could find **any** benefit related information with `Search learning center` selected.

  > I would expect the learning center to have more focused information on the actual condition or benefit. I wouldn't expect to find the [VA] Secretary's remarks to Congress in the learning center.

- 1 person was very confused by the two options. They struggled to articulate what they thought would happen, but eventually came to the correct conclusion.

**Implications**

- The `Search learning center` option is clear to people. `Search VA.gov` is less clear, and having both options requires more cognitive load for people to determine which is the right to use for their query.
- We should retest search functionality in a live environment to  accurately evaluate the UX of two search options.

### Most people would look for a link to the learning center on the homepage or in the site wide header.

During the post-task interview at the end of each session, we asked *"Say you went to VA.gov today and knew we had launched this product. How would you find it on the website?"*. 6 of 8 people said they'd expect to see something about the learning center prominently displayed on the homepage, or somewhere in the site header once it becomes available.

> Put it at the top of this page [mousing over header], because that's where people are going to look.

3 people said if they didn't see it on the homepage, and they knew what it was called, they would use the site search in the global nav to find it. 

**Implication**

We should consider providing access to the learning center from the homepage and the site wide navigation, and evaluate which location is most effective with Veterans in a future research study.


## Additional Insights

### 50% of people browsed Articles by Topic links rather than use search.

We prompted people to show us how find information at 3 points in each session, and half of the participants confidently returned to the learning center homepage `Articles by Topic` section (via the browser back button or breadcrumb) to find what they were looking for.  The other half of participants said they would use the learning center search bar for at least 1 of the 3 "find information" tasks.

**Implications**

- The organization of the Articles by Topic section resonated with Veterans, and was perceived as a comprehensive source of information.
- Because the tasks weren't search focused, and the prototype wasn't wired for search, the study didn't thoroughly evaluate the learning center search design. We should retest search functionality in a live environment to better evaluate people's search behaviors and expectations.

### The name "learning center" resonated with half of the participants after reviewing the prototype.

Before seeing the prototype, we asked participants what they expected would be contained something called "learning center".   

1. 50% expected the learning center to be benefit-focused.

2. 50% had varied expectations that ranged from educational content such as "how to use Microsoft word" to a personalized center where they could "learn about" the status of items they had in progress with the VA (e.g. claims or prescription refills). 

At the end of the session, we asked if the name "Learning Center" felt right, now that they had seen the type of content it contains.

1. The same participants who expected the learning center to benefit-focused felt the name matched the content in the learning center.

   > I think it's perfect. Just call it what it is.

2. The participants who had varied (not benefit-focused) expectations did not think the name "learning center" was appropriate. A participant with TBI and PTSD stated: 

> The thing will be getting Veterans that deal with short term [memory loss] like I do. You need something that drives us *toward* the learning center, because I wouldn't automatically go there to find these answers. "Learning center"?  We're thinking, 'What kind of baloney is this'? How's this going to answer my question?'.

**Implications**

- The name "Learning center" resonated only 50/50. We should explore and test other names that would set better expectations for the content contained in the learning center.

- It will be critical that the contextual language driving people to the learning center sets the right expectations. 

### **When viewing the prototype's only benefit hub page, multiple participants did not think the body copy links were clickable.**

The blue text wasn't sufficient enough to signify to them that the headings were interactive. All of the participants who struggled with this identified as having cognitive or functional impairments.

![](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/learning-center-mvp/images/hub-headings.png)

**Implication**

We should consider updating this pattern to make it more clear that the link headings are interactive, or move the link to the description under the heading.

### **Content specific feedback**

- About half of the participants expected to find information about changing their address under the topic area for the benefits they have, rather than under VA account and profile, based on their current VA experience of having to update their address with each individual health facility and benefits. 

- Language like "you **may** be eligible" is frustrating to some Veterans. 

  > "This is always a frustration for Vets [reads]: Depending on your type of benefit, you *may* be able to do this or that."

- 2 Veterans were unsure about what calling 311 does; recommend adding more context around this on the website.

- 3 Veterans expected to see information about the burn pit registry on the `Exposure to chemicals and hazardous materials` page.

- Multiple participants were happy to see an audience type that they identified with.  One commented immediately:

  > "I like that I see Women's Veterans here, because there's never anything for us, ever."

  If a particular Veteran group doesn't see themselves listed in a long list of audiences, they may feel frustrated, angry, or confused as to why they're left out.

## Next Steps

- TBD with team
- [Card sort](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/learning-center-mvp/discovery-and-research/card-sort-research-plan.md) to further evaluate audience and topic tags
- Mobile iterations

### Future Research Studies

- Evaluating search and navigability was limited in this study since we were evaluating a prototype and had to pose specific scenarios. Once we have a live environment, we should:
  - Re-evaluate the ease of navigating between the learning center and benefit hub
  - Include tasks that encourage users to use the learning center search functionality so we evaluate the ease-of-use and cognitive load needed to search when there are radio buttons.
  - Include tasks to allow us to evaluate how they understand the difference between learning center search and global site search.
- We weren't able to recruit participants under 34 for this study. To get a better understanding of the needs of younger Veterans, future studies should include the full spectrum of ages in our participant pool.
- To ensure we are meeting the needs of Veterans using non-laptop or desktop devices, we should test mobile versions of our designs. Once we have a product in a live environment, we should ensure to include users using mobile and assistive technology in research studies.
