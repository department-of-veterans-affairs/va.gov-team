**Subject:** VA.gov invites you to participate in card sorting exercise and earn [$XX]

Hello, 

The VA.gov team is running a card sorting exercise for a new web product designed to help Veterans find answers to questions about VA benefits and services, and their VA.gov account. 

In an effort to improve the website and understand how to organize information in this product, we are looking for Veterans who may be interested in giving input on how to organize articles.

**What will I be doing in this session?**
You will be sent two links asking you to organize article titles into categories. If the categories don't feel right, you will have the opportunity to create your own categories. 

**How long is a session?**
The session is self guided and should take you 10-15 minutes to complete.

**Interested in participating?**
Please write back to obtain links to the study and a code in order to get a thank you gift card.
