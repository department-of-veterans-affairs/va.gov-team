# Research Summary for Learning Center Topics and Audience Tags Card Sort

Liz Lantz, Public Websites, 9/22/2020

## Background

[Card sort research plan for Veterans](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/learning-center-mvp/discovery-and-research/card-sort/card-sort-research-plan-veterans.md)

[Card sort research plan for SMEs](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/learning-center-mvp/discovery-and-research/card-sort/card-sort-research-plan-sme.md)

This card sort was conducted to evaluate the nomenclature for specific learning center audience and topic labels, and see how those labels are applied to articles by: 

- Veterans, and 
- Subject matter experts (SME) or people who create/manage content for Veterans.

 We felt a card sort would supplement [our usability study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/learning-center-mvp/discovery-and-research/usability-study-research-plan.md) by helping us to answer the following:

- Does each audience/topic label make sense to participants?
- How do participants assign the primary audience and topic labels to articles?
- Have we missed, or mis-labeled, any significant audiences or topics?
- Do they understand the labels in expected or unexpected ways?

We focused the card sort on a portion of audience and topic labels for the learning center, to reduce the burden on participants and understand the performance labels we were most interested in learning about.

## Methods

### Conducting the card sort

We conducted a hybrid card sort via [Optimal Workshop](https://www.optimalworkshop.com). An hybrid card sort asks participants to sort a list of items into provided categories, or create and name a category if one of the provided categories doesn't feel right. 

Participants completed 2 different card sorts: one to evaluate audience labels, and one to evaluate topic labels.  Both groups received the same Veteran-facing cards and categories for topics.  SMEs receieved an additional set of cards focusing on non-beneficiary labels. We wanted to test some non-Veteran audience labels with SMEs, so we created a separate sort for Veterans and SMEs to test audience labels.

- __Veteran audience card sort:__ The audience card sort for Veterans contained 13 cards and 9 categories.
- __SME audience card sort:__ The audience card sort for SMEs contained 21 cards and 14 categories, including both Veteran-facing and non-beneficiary labels.
- __Topic card sort:__ The topic card sort for both participant groups contained 16 cards and 6 categories. 

- The studies were open from August 31 - September 14. We had originally planned to close both on September 11, but extended the time due to the Labor Day holiday.

### Participants

We used Perigean to recruit 50 Veteran participants, and our team's product owner emailed a link to the card sort to about 40 SME participants. 

- 39 Veterans of 47 Veterans completed the topic card sort
- 39 of 42 Veterans completed the audience card sort
- 9 of 10 SMEs completed the topic card sort
- 9 of 9 SMEs completed the audience card sort

### How we evaluated the studies

Each card sort was evaluated individually. We first looked at how people mapped cards to categories compared to what we expected them to do.  Then, we dug into areas of lower agreement to evaluate:

- Where else did people put the cards we thought would go into a particular category?
- What unexpected cards did people put into a category?

Once the individual studies were evaluated, we looked for trends across both audience groups to identify any significant findings that apply to our beneficiary and SME users.

The studies don't give us a holistic view of how people will understand the nomenclature once both topics *and* audience labels are applied. It's likely that having both labels on a single article will help someone understand the purpose of the content.

## Key findings across both participant groups

1. We can confidently move forward with most of the audience and topic labels we've proposed. [Details](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/learning-center-mvp/discovery-and-research/card-sort/card-sort-research-summary.md#1-we-can-confidently-move-forward-with-most-of-the-audience-and-topic-labels-weve-proposed)
2. Adding multiple categories and front-end tags to articles will increase findability; a second audience label may be helpful.

3. Participants created some new categories that are worth considering.

#### Details

---

#### 1. We can confidently move forward with most of the audience and topic labels we've proposed.

Across both participant groups and card sorts, people mapped the majority of articles the way we expected.  The audience labels had a slightly higher rate of agreement than the topic labels overall. This validates that we're on the right track with the nomenclature we've selected, and don't need to make changes to most of the labels.

**Audience labels**

Out of the articles and labels we mapped, ``Veterans 65+ with complex care needs`` had a low rate of agreement with what we expected.  SME and Veteran participants responded similarly.

- People put articles we expected to see here into other groups, which demonstrates a broader scope of thinking about those articles.  
- People also put articles into this group that applied to only one part of the label ("65+" or "complex care") such as `What is a protected pension?`. 
- Simplifying the label may make its intention more clear to both content authors and Veterans. 

**Topic labels**

The [cards added to  `Records` and  `VA account and profile` by Veterans](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/learning-center-mvp/discovery-and-research/card-sort/card-sort-research-summary.md#veterans-associated-records-and--va-account-and-profile-with-a-wide-variety-of-content) tell us they have a broader mental model around these categories than we expected.  

People thought about the topic of  "records" in ways beyond "official records and documents".   For VA account and profile, the misalignment between what participants did and what we expected seemed to be related to the words "my" and "your" in the article name.

The scope in these topic categories was narrower in the SME card sort, which encourages us to believe the content will be categorized appropriately by content authors. Still, we may want to consider adding clarification to the  `Records` label so that Veterans can quickly understand the content available there. 

**Recommendations**

- Move forward with the majority of labels as proposed.
- Consider revising the audience label ``Veterans 65+ with complex care needs``. 
- Consider revising `Records` so Veterans have a more specific understanding of what this topic is about.

#### 2.  Adding multiple categories and front-end tags to articles will increase findability; a second audience label may be helpful.

While we had majority agreement across many groupings, some were by only a small margin. Across all card sorts, cards were placed into an average of 4 different categories. The variation in these groupings validate that the learning center needs to support different mental models so people can find content they're looking for, in the way that they think about it.

The topic card sort had less agreement overall than the audience, which supports our initial hypothesis that: 

- Users categorize content more variably or differently than our official benefit hub groupings
- Multiple topic tags may be helpful in surfacing content to people
- And more granular content-focused tags may be more helpful

In our audience card sort, participants put articles into categories we didn't expect about 20% of the time in both groups.   Often times, the associations made sense, such as `What is adult day care` being mapped by many participants to `Family members and caregivers`.  People also put articles with the word "family" into this category such as:

- How do I become a fiduciary for my Veteran friend or family member? (3 SME participants)
- What VA family member benefits are my same-sex spouse eligible for? (3 Veterans, 1 SME)

Many of the one-off instances for other articles seem to be related to people considering their own personal situation, e.g. putting `How do I verify my school enrollment?` into `Women Veterans`.

This suggests there could be a need to surface content by audience in more than one way, but it's challenging to determine that conclusively since our card sort did not combine audience and topic labels for the sort.  We should leverage analytics to determine if  allowing for a second front-end audience tag will improve the UX for people who look for content by audience.

**Recommendation**

- Move forward with categorization and tagging [template requirements](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/learning-center-mvp/template-requirements.md#frontend-content-tags) as outlined.
- Monitor interactions with audience tags, and audience-related search terms to understand if people would benefit from a second audience label.

#### 3. Participants created some new categories that are worth considering.

There were 3 categories created by 2 or more participants with a high rate of agreement on the cards that belonged in them.

Articles about claims were grouped into different categories than we expected more frequently than other articles. Overall, people put them into the `Disability` category, but some people created a claim-specific category in both [Veteran](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/learning-center-mvp/discovery-and-research/card-sort/card-sort-research-summary.md#there-was-a-high-association-between-claims-and-disability-2-participants-created-a-category-called-claims) and [SME](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/learning-center-mvp/discovery-and-research/card-sort/card-sort-research-summary.md#sme-participants-created-some-new-categories-that-arent-in-our-topic-list) participant groups.  All the cards that had the word `claim` in it were added to this new group.  Participants called this category:

- My VA Claims
- Claims
- Claim related resources

 [The only audience category that participants created](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/learning-center-mvp/discovery-and-research/card-sort/card-sort-research-summary.md#veteran-participants-created-a-label-related-to-non-citizen-nationality) (for the article `Benefits and services for Veterans who are Philippine U.S. nationals`) was related to Veterans who are non-citizen U.S. nationals. If we have enough content to warrant creating a category for this audience group, we should consider adding this label.

Two Veterans created a `Points of contact` category with articles about contacting someone or a directory. The way other participants sorted `directory of [contacts]`  cards suggests that most people will look under `Other topics and articles` for that information, but there was less agreement about where to put the article `Who do I contact about debt on my account` (3 SME and 20 Veteran participants put this into `VA account and profile` .  

We should consider if we can surface contact information more clearly through a label with the word `contact` in it or some other way, such as a "contact us" page.

**Recommendations**

- Consider adding a claim-specific label.
- Consider adding a label for non-citizen U.S. national Veterans (based on content).
- Consider ways we can more clearly surface content listing points of contact, such as creating a contact-specific label, and/or ensuring that this type of content consistently gets tagged with `Other topics and articles`.

## Audience label card sort details

### Veteran participants

This table outlines the audiences we expected Veteran participants to associate with each article, and the number of people who did what we expected:

|      | Audience (category)                      | Article (card)                                               | Number of participants who agreed (out of 39) |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | All veterans                             | How do I verify my school enrollment?                        | 32                                            |
| 2    | All veterans                             | What is a “protected” pension?                               | 31                                            |
| 3    | All veterans                             | How do I reset my password?                                  | 35                                            |
| 4    | Family members and caregivers            | Forms for filing a life insurance claim for your deceased Veteran | 23                                            |
| 5    | Gulf War Veterans                        | Presumptive Gulf War diseases                                | 37                                            |
| 6    | Incarcerated Veterans                    | VA services for Veterans in prison or who are about to be released | 39                                            |
| 7    | LGBTQ Veterans                           | What VA family member benefits are my same-sex spouse eligible for? | 34                                            |
| 8    | Minority Veterans                        | Benefits and services for Veterans who are Philippine U.S. nationals | 32                                            |
| 9    | Native American Veterans                 | Which tribal governments participate in VA’s NADL home loan program? | 37                                            |
| 10   | Women Veterans                           | Can I get mammogram screenings at VA?                        | 37                                            |
| 11   | Women Veterans                           | VA services for women Veterans experiencing homelessness     | 38                                            |
| 12   | Veterans age 65+ with complex care needs | What kinds of long-term care services does VA offer?         | 17                                            |
| 13   | Veterans age 65+ with complex care needs | What is adult day care?                                      | 17                                            |

#### Veteran participants mapped the majority of articles to audience labels the way we expected.

31 of 39 (79%) or more people mapped 10 of the 13 articles to our expected audience label. The audience labels `Incarcerated Veterans`, `Women Veterans`, and `Native American Veterans` had the highest rate of agreement.

##### **Takeaway**

The mental model of participants aligns with what we expected for the most part. We should feel confident moving forward with the labels that had a high agreement rate.

#### The audience label `Veterans age 65+ with complex care needs` had the lowest rate of agreement.

Only 17 of 39 (43%) participants matched the articles we expected with that audience label.  The remaining participants placed these articles in less expected audience labels.  The placement isn't wrong, but suggests that Veterans think more broadly about these topics.

People placed the article `What kinds of long-term care services does VA offer?` under:

- Veterans age 65+ with complex care needs (17, this was the category we expected) 
- Family members and caregivers (11)
- All Veterans (9)
- LGBTQ Veterans (2)

People placed the article `What is adult day care?` under:

- Family members and caregivers (20)
- Veterans age 65+ with complex care needs (17, this was the category we expected)
- All Veterans (2)

The other articles people placed into the `Veterans age 65+ with complex care needs` category suggest they focused on the _65+_ or the _complex care_ part of the label, rather than understanding it all together, as one whole. 

For example, Veteran participants put the following articles into the `Veterans age 65+ with complex care needs` category:

- What is a “protected” pension? (5)
- Forms for filing a life insurance claim for your deceased Veteran (3)
- Presumptive Gulf War diseases (1)
- What VA family member benefits are my same-sex spouse eligible for? (1)

##### **Takeaways**

- Veterans think more broadly about the topics we selected for the `Veterans age 65+ with complex care needs` audience group. 
- We should consider modifying or adding audience labels, or allow for multiple audience front-end tags, to support this broader scope of thinking and surface articles for people who want to see content by audience.
- Simplifying the label  `Veterans age 65+ with complex care needs` may also make it easier for users to find relevant articles with this label or understand the types of articles that can be found with this label.

#### The `Family members and caregivers` audience label performed lower than most other audience categories. 

23 of 39 (59%) participants matched this audience label to the article we expected (`Forms for filing a life insurance claim for your deceased Veteran`).  The remaining participants matched this article to audiences that were both broader and more specific than what we expected:

Participants mapped our designated family member article (`Forms for filing a life insurance claim for your deceased Veteran`) into these other audiences:

- All Veterans (11)
- Veterans age 65+ with complex care needs (3)
- Gulf War Veterans (1)
- Claims (1, this was a participant created category)

The `Family members and caregivers` audience label had these articles matched to it. This may suggest that Veterans thought about this label in terms of *their own* family members (dependents), or perhaps from the perspective of a "Veteran as a caregiver for another Veteran":

- What is adult day care? (20)
- What kinds of long-term care services does VA offer? (11)
- What VA family member benefits are my same-sex spouse eligible for? (3)
- How do I verify my school enrollment? (2)
- What is a “protected” pension? (2)

##### **Takeaway**

- The majority of participants mapped this audience as we expected, so we should feel confident moving forward with it as-is.
- A secondary audience front-end tag or category could help clarify exactly what an article is about, and avoid misinterpretation.

#### Veteran participants created a label related to non-citizen nationality.

In this hybrid card sort, people had the ability to create their own categories if those we provided didn't make sense. The majority of categories people created for this study were topics, rather than an audience. There was one exception: 2 out of 39 participants created a category for the article `Benefits and services for Veterans who are Philippine U.S. nationals`: 

- Non-US Citizen Veterans Information (1)
- Non-US national Veterans (1)

The nomenclature participants used isn't quite correct, but the creation of these categories shows that 2 people saw this as different enough from `Minority Veterans` (our suggested audience), and that there is awareness about the difference in access to certain types of VA services based on citizenship status for this audience.

##### **Takeaway**

We should consider a separate audience group for content that applies to U.S. nationals.

### SME participants

This table outlines the audiences we expected SME participants to associate with each article, and the number of participants who did what we expected:

|      | Audience (category)                                          | Article (card)                                               | Number of participants who agreed (out of 9) |

#### SME participants mapped the majority of articles to audience labels the way we expected.

7 of 9 (78%) or more people mapped 13 of the 21 articles to our expected audience label. The audience labels `Gulf War Veterans`, `Women Veterans`, and `Veteran service organizations and accredited representatives` had 100% agreement.

8 of 9 participants agreed with our expected mapping for `Lenders, appraisers, and other real estate professionals`, `Funeral directors and cemeteries`, `Schools, administrators, and other education professionals`, `Native American Veterans` and `LGBTQ Veterans`. 

##### **Takeaway**

The mental model of SME participants aligns with what we expected for the most part. We should feel confident moving forward with the labels that had a high agreement rate.

#### SME participants generally understood how to apply the non-beneficiary audience labels.

6 of the 14 audience tags we tested are intended to be applied to articles with a non-Veteran, non-beneficiary audience in mind.  All of those labels were mapped to the article we expected by 6 or more participants.  The `Fiduciaries` label had the lowest rate of agreement among this group.  

One article we thought people would put in this category was titled, `How do I become a fiduciary for my Veteran friend or family member?`  3 participants mapped it to the `Family members and caregivers` audience group, likely because of the phrase "family member" in the article title.  

In addition to the fiduciary example, there were more instances of beneficiary labels being applied to non-beneficiary audiences. 

-  `Forms for filing a life insurance claim for your deceased Veteran` was grouped under `Funeral directors and cemeteries` (1)
-  `What is a VA appointed fiduciary responsible for?` was grouped under `Family members and caregivers` (1)
- `How do I verify my school enrollment?` was grouped under `Career counselors and other employment specialists` (1) and `Schools, administrators, and other education professionals` (4)

While these are not major trends, it suggests that there is potential for SMEs to confuse beneficiary and non-beneficiary labels, and/or apply both to an article.

##### **Takeaways**

- This data suggests that SMEs generally understand the difference between articles for beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries. 
- The ability to add more than one audience tag or category would improve content authors ability to reach the right audience, especially when their content applies to multiple groups. 
- Our hypothesis that there is the potential for SMEs to mix beneficiary and non-beneficiary audiences is valid.

#### SME participants applied some Veteran audience labels more broadly than we expected.

The `All Veterans` audience label had the most cards (9 of 21) added to it across all the categories. __It's meaningful that SME authors would map an article to a very broad label when more specific and relevant options are available.__ All 3 of the cards we expected to make it into this category were placed there by at least 33% of participants, but people also added things like: 

- Forms for filing a life insurance claim for your deceased Veteran (2)
- Benefits and services for Veterans who are Philippine U.S. nationals (2)

The `Family members and caregivers` audience label also had a variety of cards added to it that we expected to be placed in other categories, such as:

- What is adult day care? (5)
- How do I become a fiduciary for my Veteran friend or family member? (3)
- What kinds of long-term care services does VA offer? (2)

##### **Takeaways**

- SMEs applied the `All Veterans` audience label more broadly than we hoped, even when more specific categories were available.  
- We should help content authors and SMEs understand the benefit of using a more specific audience label when applicable. When people apply `All Veterans` to something related to pension or education, it suggests they're defaulting to the safest option possible without considering whether or not a more specific label would reach the target audience.
- The ability to add more than one audience category or front-end tag could help content authors when their content could be used by multiple audience groups. The grouping we saw isn't necessarily wrong.

#### SME participants didn't map articles to  `Veterans 65+ with complex care needs` the way we anticipated.

The majority of SME participants mapped one article like we thought they would: `What kinds of long-term care services does VA offer?` was placed into this category by 6 of 9 people. This audience label had 2 other noteworthy results:

1. Only 33% (3 out of 9) associated `What is adult day care?` with this audience group.  The rest of the SME participants put that article into `Family members and caregivers`, which tells us that they thought about this article from the perspective of the caretaker, and not necessarily the Veteran.  This is similar to the results we saw from Veteran participants.

- 5 of 9 participants placed `What is a protected pension?` into this category.  This is something we suspected might happen, and suggests that people might not be noticing or taking the `complex care needs` portion of this label into consideration.

**Takeaways**

- SMEs generally understood this label, but also had broader associations (e.g. adult day care with a family caregiver) that caused them to place an article in a place we didn't expect.
- Simplifying the label  `Veterans age 65+ with complex care needs` may make it easier for SMEs to use this audience label more specifically as it applies to the content they're working with.  Because it's a long label with two parts, people may apply it as-is to content that isn't exactly relevant to this audience label.

## Topic label card sort details

Both Veteran and SME audiences received the same cards and categories; this table outlines the categories we expected  participants to associate with each article, and the number of participants who did what we expected:

|      | Topic (category)                  | Article (card)                                               | Number of Veterans who agreed (out of 39) | Number of SMEs who agreed (out of 9) |

### Veteran Participants

#### Veterans mapped articles to topics the way we expected about half of the time.

7 of the 16 articles were mapped to topics the way we expected by 20 (51%) or more people. The agreement rate varied from 21-92% across the articles, with an average of 52% overall.   `Housing assistance and home loans` was the only topic where all the articles were mapped as expected by the majority of participants. As a topic category, `Careers and employment` had the lowest rate of agreement.  Since this was not the case in our SME topic card sort, we suspect this is due to participants not being familiar with the VSOC acronym.

In most cases, the unexpected associations people made were logical, and seemed to be a result of either:

1.  The article relating to multiple topics (e.g. 22 participants associated `Where can I view my VA payments online?`  to `VA account and profile` instead of `Records`, which is what we expected).  It's natural that the primary topic would vary based on an individuals perspective.
2.  A person didn't understand something in the article itself. For example,`How to prepare for your Agent Orange Registry Health Exam` would be challenging to associate with `Disability` if you weren't familiar with Agent Orange. 

**Takeaway**

- With many of our key data points near 50%, the data doesn't conclusively support any changes one way or the other.
- This validates that our plan to include articles in multiple topic categories will help surface content for Veterans with a variety of mental models.

#### There was a high association between `claims` and `disability`; 2 participants (Veterans or SMEs?) created a category called `Claims`.

The majority of participants mapped articles with the word `claim` in it to the `Disability` category, instead of the topic we identified as being primary.   This suggests that Veterans think about claims in the context of disability benefits, even though other VA benefits are also claims and have claims status.

- 22 participants mapped `How do I check my claim status?` to `Disability`  instead of `VA account and profile`
- 19 participants mapped `How to challenge a claims agent fee` to `Disability` instead of `Other topics and questions`
- 2 participants created their own category called `Claims` to group the same claim-related articles.

**Takeaway**

- Many Veterans don't associate checking their claim status with their VA account.
- This validates the need for cross-tagging/categorization to surface content appropriately in the learning center.
- A claim-specific topic tag may be helpful in surfacing content to Veterans.
- `Disability` should be considered as a category for disability claim related information, even if the content of the article directs a person to a part of the website other than the Disability benefit hub, such as an article about challenging a claim agent fee.

#### Veterans associated `Records` and  `VA account and profile` with a wide variety of content.

15 of the 16 cards were added to `Records` by at least one participant, and 13 of the 16 cards were added to `VA account and profile`. Our team had assigned only 3 articles to each of these topics, so this tells us that Veterans have a much broader mental model around these categories than we thought. 

2 or more Veterans mapped the following unexpected articles to `Records` .  This suggests that people are thinking about records in ways beyond official records and documents.

- How to upload evidence online for your claim (5)
- How to change your VA address online (5)
- Who do I contact about debt on my account? (4)
- VA HCRV specialists for Veterans who are or have been in prison (4)
- How VA back pay (retroactive benefits) works (4)
- How to challenge a claims agent fee (3)
- I lost my phone and I can’t access the code for 2-factor authentication (2)
- Directory of state Veterans agencies (2)
- How do I check my claim status? (2)

2 or more Veterans mapped the following unexpected articles to `VA account and profile` .  It's not surprising that the articles that include the word "my" or "your"  would be associated with account or profile.  

- Where can I view my VA payments online? (22)
- Who do I contact about debt on my account? (20)
- How to upload evidence online for your claim (9)
- Accepted forms of discharge documents for applying for a VA benefit (7)
- VA's adaptive housing grants for disabled Veterans (2)
- How to prepare for your Agent Orange Registry Health Exam (2)
- Directory of VSOC counselors (2)  

**Takeaways**

- We should consider making the `Records` topic label more specific to ensure it doesn't become a catch-all for anything that could be associated with a "record".
- It's understandable that people would think content with language like "my" and "your" would be found in their account and profile; we should keep that in mind as we craft IA and tags around this type of content to help meet Veteran expectations about where it might be found.
- This validates the need for cross-tagging/categorization to surface content appropriately in the learning center.

#### The variety of cards sorted into `Other topics and questions` suggests that Veterans will think to look here if they don't find what they're looking for somewhere else.

10 of 13 cards were put into this category by 2 or more participants, which isn't entirely surprising considering the broad meaning of "other".  The variety and frequency with which cards were placed here suggests that people weren't sure where else these cards should go.  Some cards placed here that our team mapped to more specific categories were:

- Directory of VSOC counselors - (19)
- I lost my phone and I can’t access the code for 2-factor authentication - (14)
- How to prepare for your Agent Orange Registry Health Exam  - (13)

**Takeaway**

People didn't create a separate category for these items, which suggests that they still felt this label made sense, and will think to look here if they don't find what they're looking for somewhere else.

#### Half of the new categories Veterans created aren't planned for in the learning center.

8 new categories were created by participants in this card sort; 3 categories were created by 2 participants (the same 2 participants did not create all of the same 3 categories).

- `Points of contact` had full agreement between 2 people who created it.   This category contained the cards `Directory of VSOC counselors`, `Directory of state Veterans agencies`, `VA HCRV specialists for Veterans who are or have been in prison`, and `Who do I contact about debt on my account?`
- `Claims` had 3 of the 4 same articles between the 2 people who created it. It contained the cards `How to upload evidence online for your claim`, `How do I check my claim status?`, `How to challenge a claims agent fee`, and `How to prepare for your Agent Orange Registry Health Exam`. 
- `Benefits` had full agreement between the 2 people who created it. It contained the articles `How VA back pay (retroactive benefits) works`, and `Accepted forms of discharge documents for applying for a VA benefit`. Another participant added those articles to a category they called `Pay/Benefits` and also included `Who do I contact about debt on my account?`and `Where can I view my VA payments online?` into the Pay/Benefits category.

Other topic categories Veteran participants created were:

- FAQs (1)
- Technical Help (1)
- VA Resources (1)
- Indebtedness Division (1) 
- Health care (1)

Participants weren't exposed to the full range of topic labels we'll launch with, so we can't know if they still would have created these labels if they had the full list of learning center categories. For example: Health care is already a category, but not included it in the card sort.  Still, it's helpful to have this understanding of how people think about these topics as we consider future iterations of the learning center.

**Takeaways**

- Veterans didn't think the categories we provided felt right for some articles, but we can't know what they would have done if they had seen the full list of topics we'll have in the learning center.  We should monitor search data and analytics to see if trends emerge that support these findings, and re-evaluate at that time if any new categories need to be added.
- Topics specific to claims and contact information may be helpful to Veterans.  
- We suspect a topic called `Benefits` would be less helpful to people if they saw the full range of available topics.

---

### SME participants

#### SME participants mapped articles to topic labels the way we expected the majority of the time.

5 of 9 (56%) or more people mapped 10 of the 16 articles to our proposed topic label the majority of the time. `Housing assistance and home loans` and `VA account and profile `  had the highest level of agreement overall, with the rest of the topics hovering around 50%.  

- Articles we mapped to `Housing assistance and home loans` were mapped 17 out of 18 possible times (94%).
- Articles we mapped to `VA account and profile ` were mapped 19 out of 27 possible times (70%).
- Articles we mapped to `Other topics and questions` were mapped 20 out of 36 possible times (56%).
- The article we mapped to `Careers and employment` was mapped 5 of 9 possible times (52%).
- Articles we mapped to `Records` were mapped 14 out of 27 possible times (52%).
- Articles we mapped to `Disability` were mapped 12 out of 27 times (44%).

Articles in 3 of the categories had particularly low numbers that brought down the topic performance, and are detailed in the next finding.

##### **Takeaway**

The SME mental model is mostly aligned with ours around topics, and the data doesn't suggest we need to make any major changes to our topic labels.

#### The articles SME participants most frequently sorted into unexpected topics were related to claims and payments.

The majority of articles that had lower rates of agreement across topics had to do with claims or payments. Most SMEs placed articles with the word "claim" into `Disability`.  `Disability` still applies to those articles, and this trend supports the need for multiple topics to be applied to articles.  One SME created a category called `My VA Claims` for all claim articles.

There wasn't a general consensus about where to put all articles referring to pay or payments; they were put into a variety of categories. `How VA back pay (retroactive benefits) works ` was put into `Other topics and questions` by 5 of 9 SMEs.

SMEs really weren't sure what to do with `Where can I view my VA payments online? `; it was put into 5 of the 6 categories.  The most common topic it was assigned to was `VA account and profile`, but by less than the majority. 2 SMEs created a separate category called `Payments and debts` and placed the `Where can I view my VA payments online?`  article there.

##### **Takeaways**

- SMEs are thinking about claims and payments in a different, but not necessarily incorrect, ways. 
- This validates that our plan to apply multiple topic  categories to articles will help surface content for Veterans with a variety of mental models.

#### SME participants created some new categories that aren't in our topic list.

In both the topic and audience card sorts, SME participants created topic categories we haven't planned for in the learning center.  With only 9 participants, this data doesn't conclusively suggest changes are needed, but it's helpful to have insight into other ways people think about topics as we iterate on the learning center:

- Payments and debts  (2)
- State and local resources (1)
- State and local government (1)
- My VA Claim (1)
- Claim related resources (1)
- Best practices  (1)

- Account management (2)

Claim categories were also created by our Veteran participant group, suggests that a claim-specific topic or learning center category could be helpful to people. 

**Takeaway**

- There isn't strong evidence to suggest we've missed any major categories based on this card sort.
- We should keep the categories SMEs created in mind as we see how the learning center is used to determine whether or not adding categories around payments, claims, or state and local governments (all created by more than 1 person) would be helpful.

## Next Steps

1. Incorporate insights gained from this card sort into the nomenclature for the learning center. 
2. Monitor how these labels are applied by content authors once the learning center is launched.
3. Evaluate how these labels resonate with Veterans in upcoming research studies.
4. Define metrics we can use to monitor the above.
