**Subject:** Participate in user research with VA 

Hello, 

The VA.gov team at the Department of Veterans Affairs is running a user research session. The research is for a new web experience designed to help Veterans find answers to questions about their VA benefits, services, and other common customer service questions. 

We are looking for Veterans who are interested in participating in a card sort to help us improve the website and understand how to organize information. 

**What will I be doing in this session?**
You will be sent links to two card sorts asking you to sort article titles into categories. If the pre-defined categories don't feel right, you will have the opportunity to create your own categories. There are no wrong answers. We just want to know how you would categorize things.

**How long is a session?**
The session is self guided and should take you 15-20 minutes to complete both card sorts. You can do this at any time that's convenient for you.

**Interested in participating?**
Please reply to this email to receive the links and a participation code. After completing both card sorts, we'll send you instructions on how to access your thank you gift card.
