# IRIS / Contact Center Research

## Preliminary interviews

We conducted 7 interviews for our first round of research to better understand contact center authoring and content management processes. These 60-minute interviews took place between September 29, 2020 and October 16, 2020.

A notetaker was present for 5 of the 7 sessions; notes uploaded in [our preliminary interview notes folder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/learning-center-mvp/discovery-and-research/iris/preliminary%20interviews/notes)  

## Secondary interviews

Contact centers provided us with additional people to follow-up with to gain deeper insights into the content processes, and we had follow-up questions after synthesizing data from the preliminary interviews.  

Interviews with new contacts, follow-up interviews, and emails soliciting clarification were sent between October 16 - Nov ??.

These Mural boards reflect notes from preliminary and follow-up sessions with participants, as well as information gathered via email.
