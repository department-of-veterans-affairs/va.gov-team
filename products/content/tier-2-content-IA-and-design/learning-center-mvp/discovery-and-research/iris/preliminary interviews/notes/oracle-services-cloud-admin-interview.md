- Depending on question and user info (what state they live in, the topic, etc.)  submitted via Ask a question web inquiry submit - question routed to X call center.
- "Standard text" - internal scripts/template text responses for agents responding to web mail inquiries; can access external/public IRIS faqs from inside the tool and send customers a response with a link to the public IRIS faq answer.
- VA "needs a dedicated team to manage FAQs content and to keep the administrations accountable" for content accuracy.
- The 3 administrations attitude wrt their own FAQs content: "it's not mine, it's not mine" -- no ownership of content management though technically belongs to them.
- PatR (patient advocate tracking system) is built on Microsoft Dynamics, could be replacing part of the Oracle Service Cloud that is being retired
- Currently HRC not updating anything in IRIS bc of upcoming decommissioning. Historically, VACO administrations not maintaining/owning their own content in IRIS.
