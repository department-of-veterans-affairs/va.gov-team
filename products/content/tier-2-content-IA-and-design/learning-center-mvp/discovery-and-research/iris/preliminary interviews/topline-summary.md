This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.

As of 10/12/20, this document includes sessions with 5 call centers (OCC, DMC, NCC, NCA, VEO), and the Oracle Service Cloud administrator.

**The goal of this document is:**

 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data

## Research Questions & Answers

**What is the size and structure of each content team?**

- Most teams we spoke to had about 2-4 people on the team, and had a director supported by by 2-3 analysts, assistant chiefs/directors, etc.
- These teams are supported by quality teams who help verify the content they publish is accurate
- IRIS content authoring and updating is managed by one person

**Who are the people on these teams and what are they responsible for?**

- A director/chief- making sure things go smoothly. Connecting the dots. Reviewing/approving content, in some cases.
- "Analysts" = editors and writers for internal content, primarily. Producing and maintaining internal content such as job aides, SOPs, and scripts
- A couple of teams had dedicated people who are responsible for entering content and publishing in eGain. NCC has someone who "chunks out content", uses accordions, etc - sounded like someone doing the Drupal work our editors do.
- Training team members - Developing training curriculum and materials
- NCA doesn't have one person or team responsible for content creation and management. All content work is an ancillary responsibility.
- IRIS administrator receives requests to update/add content in IRIS via help desk tickets; publishes in the system

**What are the different types of content each team creates and manages, with regard to contact center customer service and IRIS content creation?**

- Content for contact center agents: 
  - job aides, SOPs, procedural guidelines, FAQs, Knowledge Articles, scripts
  - Training curriculum or documents
- All teams we spoke to said they don't create or manage content in IRIS

**Who is the audience for their content?**

- Contact center agents
- People who do PR and other kinds of public-facing events
- Veterans
- VSOs and other Veteran organizations (DMC)

**What is the process for internal scripts that support contact center reps?** 

- Many contact centers don't use scripts, because they want the flexibility to provide custom service for the individual Veteran
- Those that do use scripts didn't outline a different process for scripts vs. other internal content (see below)

**Are they different than the process for customer facing content?**

- We didn't talk to any contact centers that produce customer-facing content
- Some contact centers produce customer facing content in the sense that they're providing materials that will be presented to the public via a person, but they're not producing written articles for Veteran audiences.
- To have customer facing content in IRIS, contact center teams would need to submit a help ticket through Oracle service cloud

**What are the processes related to**

- Creating new content?
  - Receive a request from the business line > draft content, usually in word > get content reviewed by SMEs and/or chief and/or team members, via email or in meetings > update as needed until approved > publish in internal KM (or sometimes goes out as email if it's something small)
  - In IRIS, new content requests would come via a help desk ticket, and admin would create the content in Oracle service cloud and publish to IRIS. Admin assumes content is approved and ready to be published
- Updating existing content?
  - Similar process to creating new content for both scenarios
  - Some centers have a quality team who reviews content regularly and notifies team when updates are needed. This quality team isn't integrated directly into the content creation process all the time.
- Retiring existing content?
  - Usually brought to teams attention by a SME or agent, content is archived, not usually deleted
  - Sometimes content is updated to point to new source of content
  - Most teams do not proactively retire/sunset content unless there was an expiration date provided when the content was created

**Do they have any content style guides?**

- Teams have formatting guides, but not guides for voice and tone
- One team said they think eGain has some style guides but unclear exactly what those consist of.

**How does IRIS fit into each center's content flow?** 

- All the contact centers we spoke to said they don't use IRIS today
- NCA said they were just handed the IRIS FAQs but aren't sure how to move forward with them, and are waiting to see what happens w/ learning center to figure that out

**How is content maintained in IRIS?**

- An admin updates and manages content via help desk requests, using Oracle Service Cloud

**What other systems are being used?** 

- Egain (NCC, OCC, DMC)
- Sharepoint (DMC)
- Views, for task tracking (NCA)
- Oracle Cloud Service
  - This is the platform for IRIS and 3 other help systems: GI Bill, MHV tech support, and a support platform for the Oracle UI
- "KM" - we assumed this was eGain for all contact centers, but may not be. Need to confirm in follow up interviews
- "A sales force version of eGain"
- PatR is possibly coming up
- Microsoft Dynamics (MD) was mentioned as "not in the cards, but we'd love that" by VEO, and Michelle said PatR **is** MD so.. ?

**What is the process for reviewing drafts?**

- Typically done by word docs going back and forth via email, or reviewed in meetings.
- IRIS admin assumes all content is reviewed and approved when request is submitted to publish in IRIS

**If they aren't authoring in content in IRIS, what are they using?**

- Word
- SharePoint
- KM/eGain

**What's working well for each contact center in terms of content creation and management?**

- The people! Many teams talked about how strong their teams are
- Review and approval process is good in terms of involving many people, getting lots of eyes on things

**What isn't working well?**

- Teams need more resources to manage content; many have responsibilities outside of content authoring/management. 

  > We're responsible for a whole lot. The capacity of the team is stretched.

- Hard to pin down SMEs or get business lines to take ownership of their content

**Who can we interview/observe to gain a more in-depth understanding of these processes?**

Possibly team analysts, if we are interested in the internal content processes. Might be helpful to get insights into the content publishing process for eGain, or more insight into the quality teams who review content for some contact cent

- NCC: Lindsay/Regina for content review/approval process, Billy for eGain publishing process.
- NCA: Jim Lapaglia - "he's with web services and has his hands in a lot of different things"
- OCC: Janiece, internal content
- DMC: Julie Lawrence, COO for "external relations" so she may know about any of their external content, need to review recording for other people
- VEO: possibly Dorian Adeymi or Mike Cippioni. Need to get more clarity on their roles.
- IRIS: Michelle Hoxsie-Quinn
- Quality team members if we are interested in that aspect.

**Which parts of these content management processes are things we can observe and learn from?**

The content management processes we heard about are largely manual and related to internal content. Need to clarify with team how processes related to content for agents (job aides, SOPs, training material) might be helpful for the learning center effort. 

We got more clarity from Michelle about the IRIS process. Since we learned requests to update/publish content hasn't come through in years, we should also re-visit how a better understanding of IRIS will be helpful for the learning center effort in order to identify the processes we should observe.

Depending on how we want to move forward as this research relates to the learning center, it may be helpful to observe:

- The eGain publishing process, since that is what VEO wants people to use for public facing content now.

- How content teams vet requests for internal content creation/updating, since they said they sometimes reference public-facing VA.gov sites to cross-check/conduct research on the topic.
- Michelle doing a walk through of Oracle Service Cloud - maybe she can show us her side *and* what agents/content centers would see? Not sure how helpful this will be considering it's not used much and is going away.



## Hypotheses & Answers

**There will be a lot of variance between contact centers in terms of the team structure, size, and processes in place.**

Although there are some commonalities/trends across teams, there is enough variance that we won't be able to observe one or two particular roles at a call center and get a good understanding of the process for all.

A couple of teams were larger than the rest, but for the most part there are about 3-5 people overseeing  content.  There's a structure in place for all the call centers where there are 2-3 content authors/editors under a director or chief.  

A few content centers had someone supporting the content authors in a more technical capacity, actually putting content into the KM and publishing. One call center has someone who puts content into accordions or searchable tables to make things easier for agents to scan before publishing.  

There were also a few who talked about a quality team regularly reviewing their work to help w/ content inaccuracies or outdated information.

**Some contact centers don't have a formal content management process.**

All contact centers had a consistent "cycle" for content - e.g. receive request > specific people review request and create a draft > draft is reviewed by specific people > content published. But, the request and review process takes place over emails or in meetings for many contact centers so it's not formalized in the sense of being well documented or traceable. 

**Content is maintained in IRIS.**

This seems to be false. Teams said they don't use IRIS, and the IRIS administrator we spoke to said she hasn't received a request to update or publish new content in years.  It's possible that teams use another word/name for what we are calling IRIS.  The back end of what they see may be called "Oracle service cloud" when they log in.

**IRIS is a major part of their workflow, but there will be some other systems we'll want to observe people working in.**

False. IRIS isn't a major part of the workflow for the teams we spoke to. There are other systems, but at this this time, it's not clear whether or not we will benefit from observing people working in these other systems.

## Other Findings

**We heard from contact centers and the IRIS administrator that it's very challenging to get business lines to ownership for their content.**

A few contact centers cited this as a pain point in their process, because it adds time to the flow and additional work trying to track down the right people to review/approve content.  This lack of ownership has resulted in IRIS essentially being abandoned by business lines.

**Most contact centers have moved away from scripts.**

Agents prefer to use FAQs, KM articles, and other guides to help Veterans over scripts, because they want to flexibility to provide individualized service to the Veteran they're helping.
