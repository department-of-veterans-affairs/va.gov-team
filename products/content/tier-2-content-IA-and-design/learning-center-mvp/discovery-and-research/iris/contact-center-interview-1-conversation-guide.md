# Conversation Guide for IRIS Contact Center Interviews, Round 1

## Intro - 2 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Liz and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. I'm part of a team that is working on a new VA.gov product that will help Veterans find answers to questions they have about their VA benefits, account, records - all kinds of topics.

I've invited you here today as part of a study to better understand the current content processes different contact center content teams have. We want to understand how customer service content is created and maintained today. Though we're especially interested in the processes for the public Veteran-facing IRIS articles, we'd also find it helpful to understand what the process is for internal scripts that support contact center reps, if they're different than the process for customer facing content.  

My hope is that by the end of this hour together we'll have an understanding of: 

- who does what in terms of creating, reviewing, and approving content
- get a high-level overview of the process or processes, and 
- identify individuals we can speak to more in-depth or observe as part of the observational portion of our study. 

In better understanding what your current user journey is today, we hope to use this information to improve upon some of the authoring/content maintenance process with the Drupal CMS product we are creating, which is internally called learning center.

Before we start, there are a couple of things I want to mention:

- **We have an hour together today.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally move us along to the next topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear about your experience and opinions.** There's no right or wrong, and I'm here to learn from you.  I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome any feedback you'd like to share.

**Do you have any questions at this point?**

**Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured everything accurately in our notes. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 

- If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today? 

## Introductions

Chante passed along your names to me, but I don't know much more beyond that! I'd love to learn more about each of your roles and how they relate to content. I can start and we'll just go around the virtual room.  I'm going to take notes on a Mural board; I'll go ahead and share my screen.

My name is Liz Lantz, and I'm the UX Designer and Researcher for the Public Websites team on VA.gov. My team handles all the content on the site you can see without logging in. My role in the content creation and management process is primarily to design templates used by content creators, and conduct research to inform those designs and help our team better understand content workflows.

*Go around the virtual room and ask:*

- Who are you? What is your title, and what are you responsible for? 
- How does that fit into creating/managing IRIS content (if it's not obvious)?
- (For smaller groups) What's something easy and something hard about your job?

## Content teams

Thanks so much for sharing that. Now that I know how each of you contribute to content creation, and your role, I want to dig in to learn more about your team, or teams. 

- Who is part of the content process that isn't in this meeting today? 
- What are they responsible for? 

- Are there other people you work on content with that we haven't talked about yet? Business stakeholders?

*If it isn't already obvious, ask*:

- Who's ultimately responsible for creating the content on your team? 

- Maintaining the content? For example: updating an article when information changes.

- Who do you recommend we observe or talk to for our more in-depth interviews?

## Content creation/management

That is all really helpful information, thanks for sharing all of that! Let's talk more about the actual content creation and management.

- What are the different kinds of content your team creates and manages?

- Who is the audience for that content?

- How do you determine when you need to create new content?

Okay, so lets say that [*reiterate what they said, new content needs to be created*] - can you give me an overview of what happens between then and it being published?

- How does that process change for different types of content?

***If it isn't already obvious, ask*:**

- What is the process for internal scripts that support contact center reps?
- How does IRIS fit into these processes?
- Our understanding is that content is maintained in IRIS. Is that a correct?
- Are there other sites being used?
- Do you use any content style guides for any of these types of content?

For our next round of research, we'd like to observe people going through the processes you've described, and conduct more in-depth interviews to get a better understanding

- Who do you recommend we reach out to for that? 
- *Get names and whether they're best for interview, observation, or both*

## Success/Challenges

Got it, thank you. This is all really helpful as we start to talk about next steps.  I have just a couple more questions before we wrap up.

- What do you think is working well in your content management process?
- What isn't working so well?

## Next steps and Closing

I'd like to review the list of people we mentioned for our next round of research sessions:

- Review list
- Confirm observe/interview

- Can you make an introduction, or should I just reach out to them and reference this meeting? I assume I can find them in the VA address book?
- Next steps for me will be to reach out and schedule those sessions.
- Do you have any questions for me?

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the learning center.  It was great to meet you - please feel free to reach out to me at any time if you have questions or thoughts to share along the way.
