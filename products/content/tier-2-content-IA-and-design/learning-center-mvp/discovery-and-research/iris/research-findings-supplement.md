## Purpose

This document serves to supplement the team and experience maps created from the findings in our research study.

## Background 

The primary goals for this research study were to:

- Determine to the source of IRIS FAQs, and who has been managing/updating them.
- Understand how IRIS currently fits into each contact center's workflow
- Understand processes around Veteran-facing customer service content authoring and creation for contact centers.
- Understand processes around internal, agent-facing customer service content authoring and creation for contact centers.

## Research Methodology 

The preliminary round of research took place over Zoom. We conducted 1 hour remote interviews with teams at 6 contact centers:

- Health Resource Center (HRC)
- Veterans Experience Office Tier 1 Contact Center
- National Cemetery Administration (NCA)
- Office of Care Coordination (OCC)
- Debt Management Center (DMC)
- National Call Center (NCC)

We also interviewed the team lead for Oracle Service Cloud, the platform IRIS runs on.

Our second round of research included email and Zoom follow-ups with the teams we previously talked to, as well as interviews with other contacts we were referred to.

The [complete list of research questions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/learning-center-mvp/discovery-and-research/iris/contact-center-interviews-1-research-plan.md#goals) can be found in our research plan.

## Key Findings

1. None of the contact center teams we spoke with publish or update IRIS FAQ content.

2. The contact center teams we spoke with are primarily authoring and managing internal content for contact center agents; most do not handle any external, Veteran-facing content.

3. 3 of the teams have a dedicated content staff.  Content management is an ancillary responsibility for the other 3 teams.

4. Only IRIS administrators can publish or update IRIS content. 

5. A new IRIS FAQs hasn't been added in at least 7 years, and a request to update an IRIS FAQ hasn't been submitted in at least 4 years (**need to check this timeline**).

   


## Contact Center Details

### National Call Center (NCC)

- One team member uses UI elements to make content easier for agents to use. His role is to publish internal content in eGain.
- Has handled over 6,000,000 calls in 2020 so far!
- Utilize internal templates as guides for content, but don't have a tone and voice style guide

### Office of Community Care (OCC)

- Has moved away from the term "scripts" - Agents prefer FAQs
- Has an upcoming initiative to re-do their taxonomy in the KM.
- \- sometimes there is duplication. 
   \- Cross team/cross-program governance is a problem.
   \- Don’t have a good way for routing. Requests come in via email, IM, hallway conversations, etc.
   \- Business owners want to put things in the KM that don’t belong there (e.g. IT info).
- Heavy reliance on SMEs to verify content. Sometimes request contains contradictory information
- many times have to go back for additional info because it doesn’t make sense, the flow isn’t right, or there is contradictory information.
-  lots of back and forth, waiting for approval. Timeliness is a problem. Sometimes requestor doesn’t have a response.

### Veteran Experience Office Tier 1 Contact Center (VEO)

This contact center handles calls that come in through 2 phone numbers:

- White House VA Hotline.
- VA311

> "We [VA311] provide general information. Agents have knowledge a mile wide, but an inch deep on all VA services."

The team members we spoke with are members of the training team responsible for training the call center agents. From a content perspective, their responsibility is to create and maintain internal training documentation.  This documentation is created in the form of videos, power point presentations, and/or Visio documents.

This team wasn't familiar with IRIS or eGain.  They "use their own Sales Force version of eGain", which they hope to move over to Microsoft Dynamics.

### Debt Management Center (DMC)

- Doesn't have a dedicated content team

  > We truly don't have the resources to devote somebody to this type of work. It's collateral work for everybody that is doing it.

- Team lead doesn't feel like there is a set process in place.

  > As we talk about it, I'm feeling like we're fragmented when it comes to our content.

- Pain point: Inability to include attachments when responding to IRIS inquiries.

### National Cemetery Association (NCA)

- The contacts we spoke with were specifically from the scheduling office.

- Content is pretty static.

- The team doesn't have anyone dedicated to content management 

  > No one is a writer/editor as a primary role. Everyone does these tasks as an ancillary responsibility. 

- Works with the NCA web services team to publish content.

- This team is struggling with content management, and is prioritizing a total overhaul of their content and training processes in 2021. 

  > Chaos. That's really the state we're in right now, for many reasons.

- Jay's team will act as a SME for training content other teams are going to create.

### Oracle Service Cloud (IRIS)

### Health Resource Center (HRC)

- Agents primary focus is to answer phones. They rotate email duty w/ phone duty every 4-6 weeks

- Fields/metadata observed in LEAF request:

  - request number
  - article ID
  - doc type
  - initiated by
  - date
  - service (e.g. HRC)
  - existing or suggested article title 
  - suggested edit or change
  - last update
  - audience

## Recommendations

Put together initial recommendations here based on your findings. Review with your team, then edit as needed.

## Next Steps

- Conduct observational research sessions with HRC, NCC, and the Oracle Service Cloud admin to better understand their processes and workflows.
- Discuss with team to determine if we want to dig deeper into the process for content created for contact center staff and agents (job aides, SOPs, procedural guidance, scripts, etc)
