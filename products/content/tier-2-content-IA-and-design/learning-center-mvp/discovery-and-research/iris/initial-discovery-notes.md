# IRIS: background for research planning

8/31/20, Liz Lantz / Jen Lee

## Background info

### Call centers

Each line of business has their own contact centers: VBA, VHA, NCA, VEO, Crisis Line (may be part of VHA), etc. There may be multiple call centers for each line of business. We don't know:

- Do they each have their own content teams? 
- Is there a central content team for all of the contact centers?

### Content authoring and migration

We know call center content authors are currently use two things to publish articles

- IRIS is used to publish external customer articles. 

- They also use Egain to publish internal docs, like scripts for call center reps

- *Some contact centers do not use eGain and instead use their own CRM system (i.e. VEO contact center uses Salesforce)*

Now that IRIS is going to be retired, Veteran Experience Office (VEO) is in the process of getting the content teams onboarded into this tool called Egain to publish *all* content.  

- They're planning on publishing this content on know.va.gov - a public website primarily currently used by VA employees and contractors (e.g. contract claims processors). This is where those people who can't access the intranet can access things like manuals about processing claims.
- We don't want to send Veterans to know.va.gov.
- We're migrating all of the public facing IRIS content into the learning center. As we publish that public facing content, it'll be retired on know.va.gov
- Content authors will have to create content in two places until they agree to only use Drupal. Ultimately we hope they'll be able to manage all of their content with a Drupal integration.

## Who will be involved in our research study?

- Chante, Jen, Liz
  - Chante is the DEPO liaison for call centers, only central point person for dealing w/ all the different call centers
- Other folks for FYSA: 
  - Laura Petrula (VEO/IRIS): Laura is the business owner for the IRIS transition 
  - Trish Dang (VEO/IRIS): Trish is the deputy director of agent assisted technology and is therefore responsible for the strategy and implementation of systems and technology used by contact center agents 
    - ^ not clear on how their roles split out
  - Leo Catanach (VEO/Primary owner of eGain/excited to move teams to eGain/also aware of what we're doing)
  - Possibly Oksana on the CMS team, good to keep in the loop as FYSA, we may be reaching out to her later to add authoring functionality

- Contact center content teams, individuals TBD. We want to talk to the content teams that support the call centers (not the call reps at this time).

## Research study goals

We want to know what the content authors experience currently is of writing and publishing IRIS and eGain content so we can better understand their current process. We also want to work to make sure that we're addressing some of the requirements that they need in Drupal. 

### Research questions

- What is the end-to-end current authoring experience like?  
- How do you determine what content needs to be created? Is it just based on call center requests? 
- How does collaboration with the business stakeholders fit into the content creation/authoring process? 
- Who approves, verifies, and reviews content?
- What kind of content management life cycle process do they have? 
  - Do they audit older articles? 
  - How do they know when something becomes outdated and it becomes outdated or retired? 
  - Do they rely on business stakeholders? 
  - Is it random?
- What are their requirements are as part of the authoring experience? 
  - Is it important to know who the content author was? 
  - How do they use that information? 
  - If info is identified as being wrong, is someone graded on that content? 
  - Does it go back to that person to fix? 
  - What are the data things that are created as part of their authoring experience that is used for processes that they may have? To support grading, traceability, etc

### Methodology

An ethnographic study feels appropriate to get a thorough understanding of the process and answer our many unknowns.  Previous attempts (Q&A on the phone, async communication via email) have not been successful in understanding the content authoring process - we're not totally sure why.

- Hypothesis: the people we've spoken with who are representative of the content authors don't know enough to answer the questions concretely. 
- Discussed getting an author on the phone and have them do a screen share and do the task and we watch them and record them, and then maybe we have a separate session where we actually interview them.  So we have a record of what they actually do, and maybe we can interview them about what they're doing. 
- Okay to do this in one session, if better.
- Ethnographic study also works because because the multiple content teams may have different processes 

### Outputs

- As part of the synthesis it would be great to have a user journey map of the content authors, and again, it might be that if we interview 4 content team members, they have slightly different journeys. Or drastically different journeys.
- A content lifecycle map will be helpful - mapping: 
  - how do they currently manage the full life cycle of an article.  
  - How do they decide what content is needed, all the way to how do they manage the lifecycle.
  - When do they know they need to update information, retire, etc.
