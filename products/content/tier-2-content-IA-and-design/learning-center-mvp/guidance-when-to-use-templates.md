# Guidance on when to use what article templates

Many kinds of information can easily fit more than one type of template, depending on how an author prefers to organize the content. For instance, an article about how to become a fiduciary could take the form of a Multiple FAQs, a how-to Step-by-step, or a Wikipedia encyclopedia-like About page. 

Some content may call for using more than one type of template. For example, you might have a lot of text information that's best provided in an About, and link that About article to a Video article that has VA produced YouTube videos for fiduciaries. 

## Question and answer

Use this template to answer 1 question. This article template is best to use for questions that VA call centers receive consistently high volume of customer calls; or when search data shows that many users are entering and searching on the same or very similar question phrase. For SEO, use the actual question phrasing or words that customers submit, call about, or search on.  

## Multiple FAQs

Use this template to create a page with a group of frequently asked questions. The FAQs can be organized into subgroups using section headers. This template is appropriate when a topic has many related questions, especially when some or many of those questions aren’t individually being searched for or have high call center inquiries. 

You can include a single question and answer in a Multiple FAQs page even when that single question and answer also has its own page.  

## Step-by-step

Use this template to provide detailed how-to steps with screenshots. You don’t need a screenshot for every step, but we strongly encourage using them for critical steps. You can upload and crop the images in the CMS. 

## About

Use this template for text heavy content and to provide encyclopedia-like information. You can also use this template to provide information in tables, like rates and directories. 

## Checklist

Use this template to provide a checklist. User research shows Veterans love checklists to help them organize information and tasks.  

## Images

Use this template to provide visual content along with a brief text description. For example, information about types of military medals would be more helpful with accompanying images. 

## Videos

Use this template to provide YouTube videos on a specific topic. You can include 1 to 5 videos per template and link people to more videos on your YouTube page. No need to upload or embed video content; just provide the YouTube video link to dynamically display the YouTube video information like the video title, description, duration, and publication date.
