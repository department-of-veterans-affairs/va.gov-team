# Learning center homepage requirements

This is WIP and may evolve based on user research and technical findings.

__CMS__
- TBD - should this page be a node like a LC article page or should it act like the VAgov homepage? 
- Or a combination where the H1, intro text, and the H2 and H3 section headers are managed on the node/page, but the links that appear under each section are pulled from elsewhere (e.g., reusuable COPE FAQs; audience tags)? 
- In what order should/would the links display under each topic and audience category? Can we curate them for launch, but connect them to analytics, so that ongoing, the links are displayed according to what article page users most often view? 
- LC homepage must allow global and local banner alert component, reusable and unique in-body alert componenent
- LC homepage CMS governance - owned and managed by PW. (vs. article pages, which we'll need to allow non-PW teams to publish)
- Must easily allow new future article topic categories or reorganization of topic categories (example: if through Call Center volume data, we learn that Claim Status is a frequently occuring major call topic and we determine that "claim status" needs to be its own topic category that's very visible; or if in the future we want to update the FE design to show 'trending right now/people are looking at' articles as a section; or there's a pandemic and we need to create a special coronavirus section...)

__FE__ 
- Must enable search error messages and standard system error messages
- Must enable defaul analytics tracking
-
