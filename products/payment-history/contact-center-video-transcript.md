# View VA Payment History Transcript
Let's take a look at the view payment history feature on VA.gov.

After login we'll be redirected back to the tool page.

Here we can see a nice mix of payments received and payments returned and here it looks like we've got: the date the payment was received, the amount, the type, the method, direct deposited is the most common. The bank name would be here and then the account number with the last four digit digits exposed if available.

Payments returned is very similar with an issue date, the cancel date, the amount, the check number, the type, and then the reason, if there is one.

Now let's take a look at a user that may not have any payment information.

Payment history can also be found on the home page here in the disability section labeled "view your payment history."

Currently, it goes to eBenefits, but that will be moved here to VA.gov.

URL is VA-payment-history / payments. 

This is what it looks like when there's no record of any VA payments made to this user. 

In the event that it's one or the other, that section will show.

Thank you
