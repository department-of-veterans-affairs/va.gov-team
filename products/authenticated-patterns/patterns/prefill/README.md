## Background
As a Veteran, I want to have my personal information automatically filled in on VA.gov forms based on my authenticated user data, so I can save time, reduce errors, and complete forms more efficiently when applying for benefits or services

## Hypothesis

We believe that creating a comprehensive pattern for form prefill based on authenticated user data, including guidance, example code, and design resources, will:
- Enable easier implementation of form prefill across various VA.gov applications
- Promote consistency in how form pre-fill is implemented across the platform
- Lay the groundwork for future improvements in Veterans' form completion experience
- Facilitate more complete and up-to-date Veteran profiles as applications adopt this pattern
- Reduce the need for custom code related to form prefilling, leading to more maintainable and consistent applications


## Discovery
### Assumptions/Risks

- **Value Risks** (will people use it): 
  - .
- **Usability Risks** (can people figure out how to use it):
  - .
- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data):
  - .  
- **Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact):
  - .
 
### What're you building

We believe this pattern should consist of:
- one or more visual indications that form data has been prefilled, including but not limited to:
    - page-level alerts
    - inline alerts
    - additional info component
    - address/details component
    - input styling
    - directions to update profile data
