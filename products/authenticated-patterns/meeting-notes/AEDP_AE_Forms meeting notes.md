Travis Cahil shared this [link](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/77428) We showed examples of what we are looking at from this [Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1721841580875/c3be52d2e6ba2ab27b04562b9c97ee0f05f843eb?sender=u649de617cef06172cf5f0271).

## Key takeaways/Questions asked/Answers/Thoughts on prefill:
- What if user doesn’t yet have information in their profile? 
- LOA1 would be relevant since the profile locks down and isn't accessible they have to have LOA3 to edit their data in the profile
- Suggest update ability vs tell people their profile will be updated because auto updates may introduce typos.
- Will user be able to diffrentiate between a profile update, or just a local form update ie. a person may use a particular email addresses dedicated to just VA forms, etc.
- Adam mentioned a subtask feature within a form flow - dev side
- Using a seperate date update page could allow more content on one page considering the one question per page flow
- Does the confirmation page ask for a review of information that was updated? Statement of truth page? What about different names or a recent update that differs from the statement of truth page?
- If it isn’t the veteran, then the representative should be identified with the correct field so the name difference shouldn't be an issue.
- Address validation could be apart of maintain accurate profile data
- Name field may not be editable
- How do we make sure we are telling the truth to the user when we say “update profile” - post goes to the same endpoint as the profile as well as updating form fields, mimics profile web application. Like a profile app.
- Submitting a form is another way of updating a profile possibly if you’ve editing data before even submitting the form, so is this something we want? Certainly to be aware of this flow for the AE.
- “Here” is in the messaging for this type of update and is decided to be too vague.
- How will we define done to other groups? - when approved they will be in VADS plus we will reach out to teams to get buy-in and implementation before VADS submission as well as quarterly workshops with USWDS where we will connect with other agencies to implement our work.
- When contact information is edited it leads to mismatches which has led to issues so requests to change pattern to not show the address to change, but simply have the fields blank.
- My healthy vet has done profile syncing - next of kin flow to examine.
