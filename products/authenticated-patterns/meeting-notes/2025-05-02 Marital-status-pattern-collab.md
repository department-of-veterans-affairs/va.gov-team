### Date: May 2, 2025

### Attendees
- Lauren Vocke
- Christine Rose Steiffer
- Kristen Faeferlick 
- Fran Cross

### Action items
- [ ] Ask our engineers if they can discern the most frequently chosen marital status options, e.g. Married, Divorced or annulled, Separated, Widowed, Never married
- [ ] Search in our mural board to see if any forms use legally separated, or defining questions around separated.
- [ ] Change text: 'My previous spouse is now deceased', to 'My previous spouse is deceased.'
- [ ] Remove the link (to the legacy VA definition of marriage) in the additional informaiton dropdown
- [ ] On the first Marital status screen, just under the sub-heading 'What is your current marital status?' add the following text: If you’re in a civil union or common law marriage that’s recognized by the state you were married in, select Married (including state-recognized unions).
- [ ] 'Marital status' vs 'Marital status and information' sub-heading: if a team is only using the 'are you married' question, then we can call it marital status; if they are asking follow up questions, they can call it something else (like Marital status & information, Marital information, etc.)


### Notes

#### Question 1: Guidance for complex marital statuses & best phrasing for this information
- **Lauren**: The first two are related. I think we need to have the extra information. We don't have specific guidance currently regarding the additional info component - about having more than one subject in it. Lauren talked to Danielle Thierry, and Danielle said it's not necessarily against the rules, but not best practice. Especially the info we are trying to convey about why we request marital status. It would be better not to hide it. Best option is Option B (where it's at the top, under the sub heading).
  - **Lauren**: Minor tweaks to the text: If you’re in a civil union or common law marriage that’s recognized by the state you were married in, select Married (including state-recognized unions).
  - **Lauren**: This leads to the radio buttons, the first option, changing to: Married (including state recognized union)
- **Kristen**: To clarify, I had to do some paraphrasing. The link to the page with VA.gov's definition of married (that we want to include) is wordy. It would be nice to provide the URL instead of including all the text; that way if VA's definition of what is married changes... it would be best to paraphrase and send them to the linked page for more info.
- **Lauren**: The URL for the page is a legacy page. The issue is that page, I don't think will be updated. Danielle suggested we could go through that page and transfer to one of our (VA.gov) Resources and support pages so that the information is on our current site, and then we could update that. After we do that we could circle back and add the link.
- **Kristen**: We can't put links into the text just under the sub heading.
- **Lauren**: I suggest a possibility for including the link when we are able to transfer it over; include it with the additional component, and we could add another line to the new description above directing them to the additional information component where they can click the link. For right now we definitely want the information more visible. If we didn't have the explanation under the question, we would need to rely on someone going to the site, reading all the info, and then coming back to the form, which could be a big ask.
- **Kristen**: Summarizing - We don't want folks to do extra clicks, go to a different site and return. We want to show specifically the revised string we can use. It sounds like there is a short term solution (no link), and long term (resources and support).
- **Lauren**: Suggesting no link at this time, because it was last updated in 2015.
- **Kristen**: How much of a lift would it be to include a link just under the subheading? 
  - **Lauren** agrees it would be more helpful to have a link.
- **Immediate term: **
  - Lauren: How it's phrased on Option B (Why we ask this information) is the best. Guidance on additional information components is to avoid phrasing it as a question. Should be a statement. The language under additional information - no changes.
- **Middle term:  **
  - Lauren: When we do add the link - she would like to think about it and run a few ideas past some other people. What is in option C is good - it touches on both.

### Question 3: Order of radio buttons
- **Lauren**: What is in Option B makes the most sense. 
- **Kristen**: It's probably wrong to view this as a progression (although married/separated/divorced is). She thinks the top two are the most common. 
- **Lauren**: That was the way she was looking at it too. No specific data around this. Married and divorced would be two of the more common. She could look into some other forms, but she thinks this is going to be the preferred option, and one we see the most often. Could see putting separated above divorced, but she would prefer it the way it is now.
- **Christine**: Never married might be more common; and with the audience, maybe widowed? Our engineers did ask what forms we are asking it in. We could look in the last year to get a sample? It wouldn't work across all forms because some forms just ask are you married, yes/no. Maybe we can take that back to our engineers to see if they can help get us data (post-meeting note; added to action item list).
- **Lauren**: Makes sense to keep Never married as a separate option, last option or as the first, because the other four options are kind of grouped together - you're either currently married or were married, vs never married is the outlier
- **Kristen**: For now, for the purposes of testing, the current order is good. For later, we can see if we can find which is the most popular. If there is one that would support moving, we an explore that. I'll take a look at the UK form to see if there is any info there and share.
- **Lauren**: shouldn't be any issues with the current order. 

### Question 4: Separated vs legally separated. 
- **Lauren**: This would probably be better answered by legal. Making that distinction might be on a form by form basis, whether or not it matters. That is from a legal standpoint rather than a content. If it doesn't make a difference, or if the form will ask more questions later, than that would be beyond the realm of content. 
- **Christine**: Maybe this varies from state to state?
- **Kristin**: We can do a search in our mural board to see if any forms use legally separated, or defining questions around this (post-meeting note: added to action item list).

### Question 6 & 7: The term Deceased
- **Lauren**: Deceased is the correct term to use in these cases. Passed away, passed on , late - these are euphemisms that we want to avoid using (trauma informed). 

### Question 7: Checkbox for "My previous spouse is now deceased.
- **Lauren**: Checkbox for 'My previous spouse is now deceased'. Makes sense to include the checkbox before we ask for additional information. For the wording, she thinks it's fine, but we can get rid of the word 'now' e.g. My previous spouse is deceased (post-meeting note: added to action item list).

### Question 13: Previous spouse, former spouse, or past spouse?
- **Lauren**: We can use previous spouse

### Question 14: Guidance for the pattern
- **Lauren**: She will look through that next week

### Question 15: What language for the marriage or divorce document upload?
- **Lauren**: Will look at this as well.

### All questions:
- **Lauren**: She wants to look through all the questions - like 10 and 11. Adding 'Why we're asking for this information' to additional questions. Won't need it for every question. Depending on the amount, she doesn't think we need to be too concerned with overloading folks with additional information. They need to click down to see it; they don't have to read it. She will look through all the questions to see where we can provide more info. She will start looking at this on Monday

### New question: What wording to use? Marital Status, Information on your marriage?
- **Kristen**: Should Marital status be marital information, or information on your marriage(s)? Kristen will add that as a new question.
- **Lauren**: What if it was Marital status and information?
- **Kristen**: We could be flexible. If a team is only using the 'are you married' question, then we can call it marital status; if they are asking follow up questions, they can call it something else (like Marital status & information, Marital information, etc.)

### Research timing?
- **Kristen** & **Christine**: We have a little bit of time before 1010EZ research starts. Our contract ends on June 17th, and it's possible the research feedback might not get incorporated into our designs. 
- **Lauren**: will start looking at everything next week and then we can plan to meet the following week to review the remaining questions. If anything comes up in between, contact her via Slack or add another question in the Figma file.
