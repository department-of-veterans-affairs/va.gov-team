### Date Monday, May 5, 2025

### Attendees:
- Kristen Faiferlick
- Christine Steiffer
- Renata Keck
- Hieu Vo
- Fran Cross



## Agenda: 
- Kristen will show pattern that would apply to the 1010 form
- Open discussion & questions about designs


**Kristen**: The main question is 'What is your matital status'
  - Differences noted: they the answers as select - we have radio button. (Less than 6 is okay for radio buttons)
  - For married we have spouses personal info; we can exclude ones that don't relate. 1010 they ask about marriage date on personal info; we have a separate page
  - They don't ask all the questions; they have the 'Living together in previous year'
  - Our pattern has financial support on the next page; not sure how flexible the pattern will be in moving questions to other pages. They have it on a different page.

**Hieu**:
  - For the Financial form, we are asking them all of the info so we can determine if they have eligibility for copay or travel reimbursements. Not as comprehensive as our questions. Hieu hadn't thought of radio buttons vs. select. Most of the radio buttons in their form are three max; potentially it could go towards that direction. He doesn't have a strong feeling at the momement for one way or the other.
  - Marriage date: is just because their form is more condensed, so it made sense to have it in the same area. Intent of their form is to reduce the pages where they can.
  - Living situation is conditional (lived with spouse in previous year).
  - Financial situation shows up if they say they didn't live with them - it's conditional. (if they answered Yes, then the follow-up question is asked)
**Hieu**: they are flexible in how they change things; radio button change could change
    - Action item: Kristin will dig into these more. 

**Kristen**: In the research report, Hieu mentioned a list and loop for marriage. How are they using this?
  - **Hieu**: they have multiple items in their form that has list and loop. They just want same look and feel for all sessions. The spouse info - in this case they are adding it to list and loop as well. It's not actually using list and loop, but giving them the same experience. It's not always going to be a list and loop, but allows them to review info before jumping onto something else.
  - **Hieu**: For the spouse, it's not like they have multiple spouses; they are just making it list and loop so that the result is essentially when they fill out the spouse info, technically they would see the spouse info, with abiliy to edit, and then they move on. List and loop allows them to review and edit before moving to the next section. Will allow them to move through the flow faster. They won't be showing all spouses (current/previous). They might look into leveraging showing all later on.

**Renata**: Can't reconcile with the spouse loop. If they separate or divorce their spouse and then married again in the same year? Currently, no great display of this information.

**Kristen**: Might they miss out in filling out the spouse personal info if they get the review/edit screen right away? 
  - **Hieu**: That is possible, but the financial information is most important, and is asked later, so they won't miss that. One thing they talked about is what is the esence of this form? It's the financial information. What is your total house income and expenses.

**Renata**: Spouse income is rolled into a “household financial information” section because eligibility for certain groups of Veterans is determined by household income, less applicable deductibles, and zip code.

**Kristen**: If the spouse info was incomplete or wrong, it wouldn't really negatively affect the outcome as long as they filled out the financial informaiton section.

**Kristen**: For the option red for prefilled content, prefilling their name, thoughts about showing it in a white box, appearing consistently across all the information? Thoughts?
  - **Hieu**: They saw another version where it was in a gray box, and preferred that. They don't mind the white esthetic. Maybe we could switch it out and ask their preference between red and green. (Kristin: it's all experimental right now)

**Kristen**: In the pattern they say 'Did you live with your spouse [year]'. Does that get updated programmically? (we have 'previous year')
  - **Renata**: It's dynamic. Veterans are supposed to update every year, but there aren't currently any requirements that they update it. Tax year and financial info year should be the same. 
  - **Kristen**: We should probably think about following this pattern.

**Research**: Being held back by content review. Let's give it another two weeks. 

**Renata**: they wil be geting an update form CIA later today (5/5).

**Kristen**: it's possible research could happen while our team is still here.

**Renata**: will keep us in the loop to ensure we can reserve.
