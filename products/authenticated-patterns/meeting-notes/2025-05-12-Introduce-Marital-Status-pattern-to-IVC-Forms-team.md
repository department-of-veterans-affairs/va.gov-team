## Meeting Notes

- **Kristen**: Asked Jamie to share which forms ask for marital status. We're trying to learn how our pattern may pertain to their forms.
- **Jamie**:
  - 1010D is main one - most commonly used
  - 1079-59C is the other health certification that goes along with the 1010D
  - 7959A is claims form
  - 107959F1
  - 107959F2
 
- **Kristen**: The design is creally hoose your own adventure. Most teams will use maybe three of them. Forms 686C and 527EZ may use a lot of them. The crux is the question 'What is your marital status?'
  - some forms are yes/no, some need more details like ours has
  - depending on the answer, there may be different subsequent or conditional questions asked
 
- **Kristen**: The sections are:
  - Marital Status
  - Spouse's name and date of birth
  - Spouses identification information
  - Living situation
  - Additional Living Situation (why they live separately, etc.)
  - Spouses address and phone number
  - Place and date of marriage
  - How did you get married?
  - Marriage documents
  - Has your spouse been married before?
  - Review your current spouses exes
  - Review your marriage
  - Past marriages?
  - If you're Divorced or annulled
  -   - date and place
      - how
      - how it ended
      - any other exes
  - If you're separated
  - If you're widowed
 
- **Kristen**: Most teams will use just a few screens or questions. We have [1010D mapped out in Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1742843561511/4f5e5e77a91df7e061628888f10dfb7b10309183?wid=0-1743626392032)
  - Some questions are phrased differently
 
- **Rachel**: Written from veterans point of view, and we have a lot of non-veterans that fill out the forms. Are they able to change the wording?
	- **Kristen**: yes, you can make minor modifications and only use certain questions that will pertain

- **Kristen**: do you have an example? This one is interesting - it's more of who they are. Would 

- **Jamie**: It might be a mixed experience. At first they're going to ask the relationship. If spouse, they can drill down to all the marriage questions. Some statuses can make you ineligible; a lot have to do with age, when you are married/divorced, etc. They aren't dealing with eligibility right now. The user just fills out the form,  and CHAMPVA deals with it.

- **Rachel**: Isn't some of this information in their VA profile?
  - **Kristen**: We also worked on a pattern for prefilled info, and also to update prefilled info. We did a deep dive on what info is stored or can be called from the VA profile. Marital status and spouse info is not included there. Some forms are pulling from a different place than VA profile (1010EZ). If some forms want to prefill and have that info, this pattern could still be used with prefilled info. Would want to let users know at the beginning that some info might be prefilled.

- **Christine**: There's actually a pretty limited scope of info in profile that can get prefilled: Name, DOB, address, some contact info is what is typically available. But other teams are able to rig up their own version of prefill to include marital status. If we had a little longer time on our contract we might try to do that. It can be done by teams individually.

- **Jamie**: They have that information in VBA or somewhere. Veterans can update their dependents and marital status. 

- **Rachel**: I think it's fine; we wouldn't need all the exes details but the pattern itself would work.

- **Jamie**: May need to do some minor rework; it's simple and drills down to where we need it to.

- **Kristen**: Matt Dingee shared a form that just asked for date of marriage but didn't need place. We'll include in the guidance that you can adjust the page name accordingly. We would love to hear (if we're still around) ways that you're modifying it to work for you. We aren't encouraging teams to gather new information; not adding to the veteran burden.

- **Jamie**: This gives us a framework to redesign the pages a little, and the content and options we should be using.

- **Kristen**: Our earlier patterns we were able to do research, but for this one we aren't able to and product teams are doing the research. Research on prefill and this pattern are slim.
