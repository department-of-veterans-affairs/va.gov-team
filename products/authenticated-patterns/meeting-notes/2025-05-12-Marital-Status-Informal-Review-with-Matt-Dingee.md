## Meeting Notes

- **Kristin**: Provided a review of the Figma designs
  - What is your marital status is the main question
    - Explainer text
    - Why we ask for this component
     - Teams can tailor their text for their form
  - Personal information
  - Living situation
  - Spouses address and phone number
    - only asked in the current forms if they don't live together
  - Place and date of marriage
  - How did you get married
    - Note: We grouped questions about similar events
  - Marriage documents

- **Matt**: Can you hone in on second step? (Spouse's personal information)
    - **Matt**: You've split up some of this into their own pages. Is there a reason we've combined them here? Are most forms asking these questions up front?
       - **Kristen**: There are a handful that ask if your spouse is a veteran. On the digitized forms this is largely how they've grouped it. The rationale is that, because this is a lot of pages, it's helpful to reduce clicks from page to page. This is largely similar info. Cuts down on number of pages. Probably also things they know and pull from the same place. 
    - **Matt**: Other designers will look at it and say it's inconsistent. He would prefer to split them up to follow what we have today. If we test it and people say it's so many steps, or it's confusing to people, we can revisit. I can see 'is your spouse a veteran' being separate - many forms don't currently ask it today. If the pattern has the flexibility, it's better for the teams implementing it.
    - **Matt**: I got confused when you were talking about past marriages, and list and loop. When we document, point to what steps they would take to list prior marriages.
    - **Matt**: That was it, looks good

- **Kristen**: We envision this being a single chapter, called Marital Information instead of Marital Status.

- **Matt**: We don't really have good naming rules here, yet. In terms of information or status. 
  - **Becky** suggested 'Ask for Marital Information'. 
  - **Matt**: He needs to noodle on that. We have housing status, which is why I perhaps suggested Marital status. I could see 'relationships' being a sub-category. Marital is probably the thing people are looking for and as long as we have marital we'll be okay.
  - **Matt**: Here is a very simple form that hardly asks for any marital status: https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21P-8924-ARE.pdf
  - **Matt**: The guidance and figma file would have to show how to take all the things away to fit the paper form, or say there are forms you'll come across that don't have any portion of this.

- **Kristen**: There are some paper forms that simply ask 'are you married?' yes/no. We can give guidance that they could use the yes/no, or they could use the question with the radio buttons.
  - **Matt**: I would use the larger question and just give guidance that they can just map to what they need.

- **Kristen**: In our documentation, we can mock up a PDF showing the basic questions.

- **Christine**: We were thinking of all optional questions as a question bank; only grab the info you need. 
- **Matt**: in the guidance, we need to tell folks it's all optional; reminder not to ask questions that are unnecessary. 

- **Christine**: We audited the forms and put in a Mural. 
- **Matt**: It would be useful to list the forms that could use this new pattern.
