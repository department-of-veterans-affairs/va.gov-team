## Intro

**Estimated timing: 5 min**

Thanks for joining us! My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes. How are you doing today?

I want to start by telling you a bit about myself. I’m a researcher from VA. Our team works on improving VA.gov so that Veterans have a better experience getting benefits and services from the VA.

I have some notes on my screen that I might read from time to time. I’m using these to ensure that we cover all the necessary points and make sure I don’t leave anything out. 

Before we get started, when Perigean set up this session, they asked if you would be okay with a couple of observers joining us. This helps my team members learn from our conversation, and they also help me take notes so we capture everything you share.

So, I want to confirm that you are okay with a couple of my teammates joining us to observe?

- IF NO:
> Use Slack to let observers know.

- IF YES: They're in the waiting room, so I'm going to let them into the meeting now.
> [Let in observers from the waiting room.]

Welcome. This is [PARTICIPANT]. Observers, please briefly come on camera to say hello and tell us your role at the VA.

Thanks everyone, now I’ll ask the observers to turn off cameras and remain muted for the rest of the session.

There are a few other things I want to mention before we start:

- This session should take about an hour [1.5 hours for AT users]. I’ll make sure we finish on time, so I will sometimes prompt you to move ahead to make sure we are getting the information we need.
- We’re here to learn your honest opinions. Negative feedback is also helpful and it does not hurt our feelings, but only helps us to improve.
- I also want to make it clear that we’re not testing your ability, or intelligence. So, for example, if I ask if you understand something, it’s because I want to make sure the writing is clear - not to test you in any way. 
- I’m going to share a prototype with you. This is like a test version of the website, so it may not work exactly how you expect. I will let you know if we run into any issues that are due to the prototype itself.
- If for any reason or at any time you want to stop this session, you just have to let me know. It might be to pause to get some water or to stop the session completely. You'll be paid even if we don't complete the full session.

The last thing is about recordings. Recording the session helps us to confirm that we captured your opinions accurately. Sometimes we share video clips with our colleagues at VA. If we do this, we don’t connect what you share in the session to any information that could identify you. We remove your face and your name from the videos. Knowing this, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio while we talk today?

- IF NO:
> Don't record

- IF YES: Once I start recording, I’ll confirm again.
> **Start recording: `RECORD TO CLOUD`.**

I’ve started recording. I'd like to confirm again: Are you comfortable with me recording my screen and audio while we talk today?


## Warm-up

**Estimated timing: 5 min**

Ok, great! I think we’re ready to get started. I'd like to begin by learning more about your experience with VA and our online services.

- I’m curious how long you’ve been a Veteran?
- How often, if at all, do you use VA.gov?
- Do you have a VA.gov account?

If YES: What do you typically do on VA.gov after you log in?

If NO: How do you think having an account would change your experience on VA.gov?

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Things to watch for:
> - If they’ve used VA.gov before. 
> - If they have not logged into the site before and why?

Thanks, that is helpful to learn about your experience with the VA.

Next, I'm going to share a link to our prototype to get your feedback. Then I'll give you some tasks to complete. While you are doing a task, I want you to think out loud and tell me your impressions as they occur. This helps us to understand how the website works for you.

When the link opens, you’ll see a confirmation message about accessing a development portal from a website called GitHub. That is to be expected. You can select the “Continue” button, then wait for me to share more information before clicking anything on that next screen. 

_**For AT users:**_ How would you like to receive the link to the prototype? I can send it in the Zoom chat, over email, or I can read it out loud to you. Which would you prefer?

> Send link in Zoom chat: https://noxious-monster-gjxjrxqrrgfqvw-3001.app.github.dev/mock-form-ae-design-patterns/2

I've just sent the link in the Zoom chat. Did you get it? 

As we walk through these tasks, I'd like to be able to see your screen. Do you know how to share your screen on Zoom?

If YES:
- Great. Before you share your screen take a moment to close out anything you don't want me to see. And if you like, please put your phone in DO NOT DISTURB mode to mute your notifications. Let me know when you are ready.
- Great! Please share your screen now.  

If NO:
  - I’ll walk you through how to do that…

> If there is an issue sharing screens, follow the guidance found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IATvmu-0QJCH_jr4IM6eN_LFo03IR7shDqtboUUKSXY/edit?usp=sharing).

_**For JAWS desktop screen reader users:**_ You will want to hit Alt S to share your screen with us.

Thanks! Now I’m able to see your screen too.

## Closing

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today.

We just have a few remaining questions for you before we wrap up. Before I have you select anything different, let me ask you:

- Was anything that stood out to you as particularly challenging, difficult or confusing in this study overall?

Thanks for sharing that. Now, please select the “Post-Study” link at the top of the page.  Once you’re there, let’s pause and I’ll give you additional instruction. You might see an alert about unsaved data–that’s Ok, you can select “Continue.”

> [Skip any of these that were already addressed by the participant in conversation]

- As we looked at the various forms, we saw the different styles and information in the alerts. Which of these styles makes it easier to review your information, and why? Tell us about your preference for how that information is displayed. 
- As we looked at the various forms, we saw your prefilled data displayed in a few different ways. Which of these styles makes it easier to review your information, and why? Tell us about your preference for how that information is displayed. 
- We also saw the information about how to change certain kinds of data displayed in different ways. Which of these styles makes it easier to review your information, and why? Tell us about your preference for how that information is displayed.
- We saw the review page sometimes showing data that you can’t edit on the site, and sometimes skipping that information. Did you notice the difference? Do you have a preference between those two options?

Awesome, thanks so much for your opinion on these options. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on VA.gov and make sure it really works for Veterans.

In general, I’d love to hear what you think about your overall experience - being scheduled for this research session, participating in the research session. Could we have done anything differently/better?

I wanted to check back in about our recording. Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences. So I want to re-confirm that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?

- IF YES: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?

Do you have any final questions for me?

Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Pause or exit strategies

We can use these strategies to prepare for difficult situations.

### If the participant isn't feeling well

I'm sorry you're [not feeling well]. Do you feel up for continuing? You'll be paid even if we stop early.

> If they choose to continue...

Okay, just let me know if you change your mind.

### If the participant is showing signs of upset or distress

This sounds so hard. Would you like to take a break or stop?

> If they choose to take a break and come back...

Welcome back. I'm interested to hear more about [topic you left off on]. Are you up for continuing or would you prefer we move to the next topic?

### If the participant decides to stop

Thank you for your time today, I completely understand your decision to stop.

> If they seem distressed...

Before you go, the VA Hotline number is 988, it's a confidential helpline, and it's 24/7. It's up to you whether you call.

### If the participant is fine to continue, but you aren't

I hear that you're okay to continue. Before we do, I realized that I need a minute. I'm going to turn off my camera and microphone, and get a glass of water. Is that okay with you? I'll be back in 3 minutes.

> If you're still not able to continue, after you pause...

Thanks for letting me take a break. You didn't do anything wrong, but I'm realizing that I'm not going to be able to continue this session. You will still be paid for the full time. I really appreciate you sharing with me today. Is it okay with you if we stop? Thanks very much.
