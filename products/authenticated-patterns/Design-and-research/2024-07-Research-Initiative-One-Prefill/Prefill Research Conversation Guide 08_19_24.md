## Intro
#### Estimated timing: 5 min
**- Start transcript: `LIVE TRANSCRIPT` > `ENABLE`**

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes. How are you today?

I want to start by telling you a bit about myself.
I’m a researcher from VA. Our team works on improving VA.gov so that Veterans have a better experience getting benefits and services from the VA.

Before we get started, when Perigean set up this session, they asked if you would be okay with a couple of observers joining us. This helps my team members learn from our conversation, and they also help me take notes so we capture everything you share.

So, I want to confirm that you are okay with a couple of my teammates joining us just to observe?
- IF NO,
> Use Slack to let observers know.
- IF YES, They're in the waiting room, so I'm going to let them into the meeting now.
> Let in observers from the waiting room.

Welcome. This is [PARTICIPANT]. Observers, please briefly come on camera to say hello and tell us your role at the VA.

Thanks everyone, now I’ll ask the observers to turn off cameras and remain muted for the rest of the session.

There are a few other things I want to mention before we start:

- This session should take about an hour. I’ll make sure we finish on time, so I will sometimes go ahead and ask a specific question about your experience with the site to move us along and make sure we are getting the information we need.
- We’re here to learn your honest opinions. So negative feedback is also helpful and it does not hurt our feelings, but only helps us to improve.
- I also want to make it clear that we’re not testing your ability, or intelligence. So, for example, if I ask if you understand something, or if you would know what to do next, it’s because I want to make sure the writing is clear or it is because I am wondering if the design is effective in that spot.
- I’m going to share a prototype with you. This is like a test version of the website, so it may not work exactly how you expect. For example, you’ll be able to click some buttons, but not all of them. This is to be expected.
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop this session, you just have to let me know. It might be to pause to get some water or to stop the session completely. You'll be paid even if we don't complete the full session.

The last thing is about recordings. Recording the session to helps us to confirm that we captured your opinions accurately. Sometimes we share video clips with our colleagues at VA. If we do this, we don’t link anything you share in the session to any information that could identify you. We remove your face and your name from the videos. Knowing this, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio while we talk today?
- IF NO,
> Don't record
- IF YES, Once I start recording, I’ll confirm again.

>Start recording: RECORD TO CLOUD.

I’ve started recording. I'd like to confirm again: Are you comfortable with me recording my screen and audio while we talk today?

## Warm-up
#### Estimated timing: 5 min
Ok, great! I think we’re ready to get started. I'd like to begin by learning more about your experience with VA and our online services.


- I’m curious how long you’ve been a Veteran?
- How often, if at all, do you use VA.gov?
- Do you have a VA.gov account?

   If YES:
    - What has been your experience with logging in to the site?
    - What do you typically do on VA.gov after you log in?
   
   If NO: 
    - How do you think having an account change your experience on VA.gov?

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Things to watch for:
> - If they have not logged into the site before and why?
> - Whether any of their past experience involves an issue updating their profile data?

Thanks, that is helpful to learn about your experience with the VA.

Next, I'm going to share a link to our prototype to get your feedback. Then I'll give you some tasks to complete. While you are doing a task, I want you to tell me your thoughts and impressions as they occur. This is called the “think-aloud” method, and it will give us insights into your experience with this site.

As I mentioned earlier a prototype is like a test version of a website. It might not work perfectly, but this way we can learn what we need to improve before we share it with more Veterans.
I've just sent the link in the zoom chat. Do you see it? 

> Send link in Zoom chat

https://musical-doodle-7676579pxr3rxrg-3001.app.github.dev/mock-form-ae-design-patterns/

Can you open the link in the chat?

Do you know how to share your screen on Zoom?


IF YES: Great. Before you share your screen take a moment to close out anything you don't want me to see. And please put your phone in DO NOT DISTURB mode to mute your notifications. Let me know when you are ready. 
Great! Please share your screen now.
  
IF NO: I’ll walk you through how to do that…
[>If there is an issue](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IATvmu-0QJCH_jr4IM6eN_LFo03IR7shDqtboUUKSXY/edit?usp=sharing)

Thanks! Now I’m able to see your screen too. 

## Task Green 
#### Form tested: 10-10EZR (Address Component + Edit in Profile)
#### Estimated timing: 10-15 min
> [If the participant has NOT yet done the Yellow task, read this]

So for this task, we’re going to have you imagine that you need to update your dependent information in your health benefits, and while there you will notice that your address is also incorrect. But you'll start at the beginning of the task, where you have come to VA.gov but have not yet logged into your account. You have come to the 10-10EZR form to provide your updated dependent information, but first you notice your incorrect address. We’d like you to walk us through what you would do to change your address, and we will ask you to pause before continuing onto each subsequent page so that we can ask you a few questions before you continue. There is no rush, so take as much time as you would if you were actually doing this for yourself. Any questions before we begin? 

> [If the participant has already done the Yellow task, read this]

But you'll start at the beginning of the task, where you have come to VA.gov but have not yet logged into your account. You have come to the 10-10EZR form to provide your updated dependent information, but first you notice your incorrect address.

Great. I'll give you the address information when it is time to make the edit.

With that information, go ahead and click on the ‘Green Task’ button and tell us how you would start this process.

> [Participant clicks on ‘Green task’ to start]

### Screen 1 - Unauthenticated intro page:

Tell us what you are seeing on this screen and your initial thoughts before clicking on anything.

- Did you determine where on this page you would need to click on to start the form?
- What does this blue alert mean to you?
- Do you think there are any benefits to signing in to complete this form?

> Things to watch for:
> - Whether they notice the blue alert and what they think it is telling them
> - If they think there may be benefits of signing in and what those could be

Thank you for that feedback. Now before we have you click that button labeled ‘Sign in to start your form’, you should know that we are doing a little magic within our prototype to sign you in automatically so you don't have to go through all those extra steps you normally would. So the next screen you’ll see is what you would see after completing the sign in process. Go ahead and click on ‘Sign in to start your form’.

### Screen 2 - Authenticated intro page

Ok, great! Now that we have you logged in, go ahead and tell us your initial reactions to this page.

> If user does not mention the following aspects of the page, ask:

   - IF YES, What do you think of the location of that alert? Would you expect to see a message like that on this page?
   - IF NOT, can you tell us why you think you didn’t see it?
- Did seeing the word ‘Note’ in bold help draw your eye to that message?
- Is it clear how to begin completing this form?

> Things to watch for:

#### Estimated time: 5 min
Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. 

We just have a few remaining questions for you before we wrap up:

- We saw that blue alert message in various places across the different tasks (such as on the form intro pages before and after login, pages where your data was prefilled, and pages where your prefilled data could be edited). Where does it make the most sense to you to show that type of information?
- We saw your prefilled data styled differently between the green and yellow tasks. Did you have a preference between those two versions of how you would like to see your data displayed?
- We saw when you went to edit your data, the data was either provided in a gray card or already filled in the fields. Which of those versions would you prefer to work with as you edit your information?
- We saw the word ‘Note’ bolded sometimes, and other times it was not. Did that help to see that information better? 
- We saw some messaging around not allowing certain information to be updated on the site itself, and about keeping your data secure. Does that information make an impact on your overall perception of the VA?
- We saw some variations that had you save your changes to your profile, while others were saved only in the form. Do you have a preference between these two options? Would you want to be able to choose where that information update gets saved?

Awesome, thanks so much for your opinion on these options. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on VA.gov and make sure it really works for Veterans. 

In general, I’d love to hear what you think about your overall experience - being scheduled for this research session, participating in the research session. Could we have done anything differently/better?

I wanted to check back in about our recording. Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences. So I want to re-confirm that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners? 
- If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?

Do you have any final questions for me?

Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Pause or exit strategies

We can use these strategies to prepare for difficult situations.

### If the participant isn't feeling well

I'm sorry you're [not feeling well]. Do you feel up for continuing? You'll be paid even if we stop early.

> If they choose to continue...

Okay, just let me know if you change your mind.

### If the participant is showing signs of upset or distress

This sounds so hard. Would you like to take a break or stop?

> If they choose to take a break and come back...

Welcome back. I'm interested to hear more about [topic you left off on]. Are you up for continuing or would you prefer we move to the next topic?

### If the participant decides to stop

Thank you for your time today, I completely understand your decision to stop.

> If they seem distressed...

Before you go, the VA Hotline number is 988, it's a confidential helpline, and it's 24/7. It's up to you whether you call.

### If the participant is fine to continue, but you aren't

I hear that you're okay to continue. Before we do, I realized that I need a minute. I'm going to turn off my camera and microphone, and get a glass of water. Is that okay with you? I'll be back in 3 minutes.

> If you're still not able to continue, after you pause...

Thanks for letting me take a break. You didn't do anything wrong, but I'm realizing that I'm not going to be able to continue this session. You will still be paid for the full time. I really appreciate you sharing with me today. Is it okay with you if we stop? Thanks very much.
