| 40-10007 - Application for Pre-Need Determination of Eligibility for Burial in a VA National Cemetery | OCTO PO Rhonda Jones; VFS PM Catherine Hughes, Michelle Diuudonne Yenyo | Asks the first marital status question, but has "single" as an option. I think adopting our pattern would be an easy lift. **[2025-05-09 - Fran]** I think that this Slack channel #va-gov-mbs is the one that Catherine Hughes is in (as a release engineer); Michelle is the scrum master. I can't find Rhonda Jones in Slack. | Slack [thread](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C03QC459M0C/p1746815664032049) |  |  | Contacted Catherine in Slack; awaiting response |
| 22-1990 - Education benefits | OCTO PO Riley Ross; VFS PM Clayton Holcomb  | This would be interesting because they only ask "Are you married? yes/no" and I wonder how they'd feel about adjusting to our wordier first question that requires more time to read and process, and collects more information than they need. It's possible that we should have 2 variations of the pattern--one that's just that simple yes/no question, and the other full one we're currently building. | Slack [thread](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C075DBTEYSH/p1746816399681859) |  |  | **[2025-05-09]** Contacted Clay Holcomb on the MEB team.

Team MED (My education benefits) digitized both this form, and 22-1990  |
| 22-5490 - Apply Apply for education benefits as an eligible dependent  | OCTO PO Eddie Ricks; VFS PM Clayton | Could be an interesting conversation. Looking at their question, I'm not actually sure they'd use our pattern. What do others think? | Slack [thread](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C075DBTEYSH/p1746816399681859) | | | **[2025-05-09]** Contacted Clay Holcomb on the MEB team. |
