On our radar. Survivors pension. |  | 5/14/2025| [Meeting notes](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/authenticated-patterns/meeting-notes/2025-05-14-Introduce-Marital-Status-Pattern-to-686c-Form-Team-Meeting-Notes.md) | Kristen DM'd Fiorella, who works on this pattern.

| 5655 - Financial Status Report | OCTO PO Denise Coveyduc; VFS PM Tom Davis; Designer Megan Gayle |  | [Slack thread](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/CPE4AJ6Q0/p1746450024403249) | N/A | N/A | **[2025-05-05 - Kristen]** Kristen reached out over Slack about testing the pattern in upcoming usability tests. They can't test, but asked questions that Kristen answered. **[2025-06-16 - Kristen]** Checked in to see if they had any final questions. |
| 40-10007 - Application for Pre-Need Determination of Eligibility for Burial in a VA National Cemetery | OCTO PO Rhonda Jones; VFS PM Catherine Hughes, Michelle Diuudonne Yenyo | Asks the first marital status question, but has "single" as an option. I think adopting our pattern would be an easy lift. Unfortunately ran out of time to reschedule the meeting. **[2025-05-09 - Fran]** I think that this Slack channel #va-gov-mbs is the one that Catherine Hughes is in (as a release engineer); Michelle is the scrum master. I can't find Rhonda Jones in Slack. | [Slack thread](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C03QC459M0C/p1746815664032049) | N/A | N/A | Unfortunatly, Catherine and her team couldn't attend the scheduled meeting, and I wasn't able to find an alternative date/time prior to our contract ending. **[2025-05-29 - Fran]** Meeting scheduled for Monday June 2 at 1135 PT; **[2025-05-27 - Fran]** Contacted Catherine again asking for her availability in the next couple of weeks so I can get the meeting scheduled.  **[2025-05-12]** Catherine responded üëâüèº We would be happy to see what you all have.  Please feel free to place a meeting on my calendar and include Michelle Dieudonne Yenyo, Carly Yamrus, Brian Campbell, Kelby Stewart, Jessica Downs-Bowen, and Kenny Santiago; **[2025-05-09]** Contacted Catherine in Slack; awaiting response |
| 22-1990 - Education benefits | OCTO PO Riley Ross; VFS PM Clayton Holcomb  | This would be interesting because they only ask "Are you married? yes/no" and I wonder how they'd feel about adjusting to our wordier first question that requires more time to read and process, and collects more information than they need. It's possible that we should have 2 variations of the pattern--one that's just that simple yes/no question, and the other full one we're currently building. | [Slack thread](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C075DBTEYSH/p1746816399681859) | 6/12/2025 |  | Met with Riley Ross on 6/12. **[2025-05-27]** No response from Clay. Pinged Clay again and added Riley Ross to the thread. **[2025-05-09]** Contacted Clay Holcomb on the MEB team. Team MED (My education benefits) digitized both this form, and 22-1995 |
| 22-1995 - Change your education benefits | OCTO PO Darla va Nieukerk; VFS PM Kara Ciprich | Same as 22-1990.  | [Slack thread](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C075DBTEYSH/p1746816399681859)| 6/12/2025 |  | Met with Riley Ross on 6/12. **[2025-05-27]** No response from Clay. Pinged Clay again and added Riley Ross to the thread. **[2025-05-09]** Contacted Clay Holcomb on the MEB team. Team MED (My education benefits) digitized both this form, and 22-1990  |
| 22-5490 - Apply Apply for education benefits as an eligible dependent  | OCTO PO Eddie Ricks; VOCTO Program Manager Riley Ross | Could be an interesting conversation. Looking at their question, I'm not actually sure they'd use our pattern. What do others think? | [Slack thread](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C075DBTEYSH/p1746816399681859) | 6/12/2025 | | **[2025-06-12]** Met with Riley and shared information. Not sure if his team will use Marital Information, but he has all the info needed if they do. **[2025-05-28]** Riley answered that he's happy to meet with us.
