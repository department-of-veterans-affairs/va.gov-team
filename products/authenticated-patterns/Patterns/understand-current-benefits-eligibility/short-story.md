# Unifying VA Benefit Lists for Veterans

## TL;DR

Streamlining Veteran benefit information on VA.gov for clarity and ease of use.

## What We Did

The Authenticated Experience Design Patterns Team conducted desk research to streamline and improve the presentation of benefit lists for Veterans on VA.gov.

## Key Insights

### Veterans prefer consolidated information:

> "It’s like one stop shopping… you can use it for your medical, but you can use it for all the other things that you might have… that you don’t even know that you’re eligible for."  
> - P10

### Clear statuses aid comprehension but require careful design:

> "What would make this [status] clearer is… it should list the actual determination of each contention or issue. It would be good to see if it's deferred or approved rather than just ‘gathering evidence’."  
> - P14

### Actionable list items are well-received when instructions are clear:

> "I should be able to go to ‘Schedule Your Appointment’ [the CTA] and schedule my appointment from there."  
> - P3

## Between the Lines

The research indicates that while Veterans appreciate having all their information in one place, the way that information is presented is crucial to avoid overwhelming them.

## Yes, But

Although the unified list approach is favored, there is a risk of information overload if not designed with the user's cognitive load in mind.

## Why It Matters

This research aligns with the VA's goals to create trauma-informed, accessible, and user-friendly digital experiences for Veterans, supporting their ability to easily manage and understand their benefits.

## What’s Next

Future research will focus on refining the service list pattern, exploring the effectiveness of wayfinding tools, and ensuring the order of items meets Veteran expectations.
