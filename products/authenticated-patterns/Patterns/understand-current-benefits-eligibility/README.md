# Product outline

## Outcome Summary
The "Enrollment Card" pattern will enable authenticated users to quickly understand their current benefits and discover additional benefits they may qualify for. By presenting this information in a concise, visually intuitive card format, the pattern will reduce time and effort for Veterans navigating benefits-related tasks, foster greater engagement with VA services, and improve trust through clear and actionable data presentation.

### Problem Statement
Veterans often struggle to find, understand, and act on their benefits information due to:
- Difficulty in finding benefits information in one place.
- Inconsistent presentation of benefits data across VA systems.
- A lack of personalized recommendations for additional benefits eligibility. (probably not in scope currently)
- Unclear, erroneous or redundant information that increases cognitive load and discourages engagement.

This fragmented experience creates inefficiencies and missed opportunities for Veterans to fully utilize their VA benefits.

### Desired User Outcomes
- Clear Information: Veterans can easily see and understand their current benefits at a glance.
- Reduced Effort: Veterans spend less time searching for or deciphering benefits-related information, completing tasks more efficiently.
- Enhanced Trust: Transparent presentation of data builds confidence in the accuracy and reliability of VA’s digital tools.

### Desired Business Outcomes
- Increased Benefits Engagement: More Veterans actively explore and utilize additional benefits opportunities.
- Reduced Support Requests: Clear and consistent benefits information decreases calls and inquiries about eligibility or benefit status.
- Improved Satisfaction: Enhanced user satisfaction contributes to meeting VA’s digital experience goals, as reflected in metrics such as CSAT scores.
- Cross-Team Adoption: A reusable pattern promotes consistency across VA products, driving efficiency in product development by reduction of custom code.

## Discovery
We will validate assumptions and identify opportunities through:
- Existing Research: Leverage past two years of analytics, user interviews, and comparative studies to inform design decisions.
- Research: Expand on findings from the previous studies that explore personalization and navigation needs.
- Testing and Feedback: Conduct usability testing with diverse Veteran personas, including those using assistive technologies, to ensure inclusivity and accessibility. (product teams will condusct user testing when implementing this pattern)

### Assumptions/Risks
- Value Risks: Veterans may not understand or trust personalized benefit recommendations.
- Usability Risks: Overly complex card designs could increase cognitive load instead of reducing it.
- Technical Risks: Integrating personalized data may encounter limitations due to system dependencies or data availability.
- Adoption Risks: Teams may face challenges implementing the pattern without adequate documentation or governance.

## Alignment with OCTO's 2025 OKRs and Key Targets
This pattern supports OCTO’s 2025 OKRs and targets as follows:
### O1: VA’s digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.
- O1.1: Enhance satisfaction with web products by providing an intuitive interface to quickly access benefits information.
- O1.2: Reduce time to access benefits details, aligning with the goal of less than 4 seconds per transaction.

### O2: OCTO’s platforms are the fastest, most efficient, and most secure way to deliver products at VA.
- O2.4: Create reusable components for the pattern that other VA teams can implement, increasing non-OCTO-built capabilities.

### O3: OCTO teammates are empowered with the knowledge and resources they need to make sustained impact.
- O3.3: Equip teams with clear governance guidelines and resources to implement the pattern effectively and confidently.

### O4: OCTO positively influences VA's ability to deliver software products and services faster, safer, and with higher quality.
-  O4.1: Contribute design and development artifacts, including reusable code and documentation, to enhance delivery practices.
- O4.2: Provide support to cross-functional teams for integrating the pattern across other VA products.

 
## What're you building
### In-Scope
**Enrollment Card Pattern:**
- Develop an "Enrollment Card" pattern that includes guidance on how to:
    - Display current VA benefits a Veteran receives 
    - Display VA benefits a Veteran does not receive
    - Display status of benefits for Veterans who return to active duty (and a way to pause/unpause them)
    - Display links to detailed benefits pages for more information and/or actionable recommendations.
    - Determine how a group of cards my be displayed and ordered

**Governance and Documentation:**
- Example code and usage guidelines to ensure adoption and scalability.
- Content recommendations and accessibility compliance guidelines..

**Validation:**
- Provide accessibility compliance adhering to Section 508 and WCAG guidelines.

### Out-of-Scope
- Full redesigns of existing benefits pages or workflows outside the "Baseball Card" implementation.
- Complex eligibility determinations requiring significant back-end system integration beyond currently available data.
- Validate the pattern through usability testing with diverse Veteran personas (product teams will do this validation when they adopt our pattern).
- Decide how to access this benefits enrollment information on VA.gov (auth exp team will decide this)


## Measuring Success
We will track and measure the success of the "Enrollment Card" pattern using the following metrics:

**Business Metrics:**
- As few staging review bugs as possible.
- Increased adoption of the pattern by other VA teams.
- Alignment with OCTO’s 2025 OKRs, including improved satisfaction (O1.1), reduced latency (O1.2), increasing non-OCTO-built capabilities (O2.4) and empowering teammates to make sustained impacts (O3.3).
