# Product Outline - Critical Information Component

## Outcome Summary  
The **Critical Information** component standardizes urgent, time-sensitive actions for Veterans. Designed for **high visibility and immediate action**, this component will help users quickly recognize and complete critical tasks related to their benefits and services on VA.gov. By implementing this reusable component, we aim to **reduce missed deadlines, improve task completion rates, and enhance the overall efficiency of authenticated experiences.**  

### Problem Statement  
Veterans often miss **urgent actions** related to their benefits due to:  
- Lack of a **consistent and standardized** way to highlight critical actions.  
- **Cognitive overload** from too many competing UI elements.  
- **Poor discoverability** of high-priority tasks, leading to delays in benefits processing.  
- Inconsistent use of alerts and banners across VA.gov, resulting in **unreliable UX patterns**.  

This lack of clarity and consistency **increases frustration and reduces engagement**, making it harder for Veterans to take timely action.

### Desired User Outcomes  
- **Clear and Immediate Recognition:** Veterans can **quickly identify urgent tasks**.  
- **Reduced Effort:** Veterans can take **immediate action** with minimal friction.  
- **Increased Trust:** Veterans can **consistently perform critical actions**.

### Desired Business Outcomes  
- **Improved Task Completion Rates:** More Veterans complete high-priority actions. This could include updating direct deposit information and submitting missing documents.   
- **Reduced Support Inquiries:** Fewer Veterans contact VA support about urgent actions. 
- **Standardized UX Patterns:** More VA.gov products use the same component to communicate urgent actions.

## Discovery  
We will validate assumptions and refine our approach through:  
- **Existing Research:** Leverage findings from **task completion studies**, **CTA design best practices**, and **previous usability testing** on alert-based UI patterns.  
- **Cross-Team Alignment:** Collaborate with **VA.gov product teams** to determine where the component is most valuable.  
- **Accessibility Considerations:** Ensure **accessibility beyond Section 508 and WCAG compliance**.

### Assumptions & Risks  
- **Value Risks:** Users may become desensitized if too many actions are "critical."  
- **Usability Risks:** Poor placement or excessive use may reduce effectiveness.  
- **Technical Risks:** The component must work across multiple **frontend implementations (React, Web Components, etc.)**.  
- **Adoption Risks:** Teams may hesitate to adopt without clear **guidelines and governance**.

## What We're Building  
### **In-Scope**  
#### **Critical Information Component**  
- Develop a **UI component** for surfacing urgent actions.  
- Ensure the component:  
  - Uses **a standardized design** that highlights urgency.  
  - Users **an action-oriented CTA** that directs users to the relevant task.  
  - Is **accessible beyond compliance.** Supports screen readers, alternative navigation, and other assistive technology tools.
  - Can be **embedded in existing components**, such as **Service List Items**.  

#### **Governance & Documentation**  
- **Example code and usage guidelines** for teams implementing the pattern.  
- **Design system documentation** in **VADS** to ensure adoption.  
- **Clear accessibility compliance guidelines** to ensure usability for all Veterans.  

#### **Validation**  
- Ensure **full compliance** with **Section 508 and WCAG standards**.  

### **Out-of-Scope**  
- Testing the effectiveness of individual implementations. VFS teams will validate this in their products.  
- Decisions on when or where to display critical actions. VFS teams will determine implementation.
- Large-scale workflow changes beyond integrating this component into existing UI patterns.  

## Measuring Success  
We will track and measure the success of the **Critical Information** component using the following metrics:

### **Business Metrics:**  
- Increased adoption of the component across VA.gov.  
- Reduction in **missed actions and deadlines** due to clearer CTAs.  
- **Improved CSAT scores** related to ease of completing urgent tasks.  
- Alignment with **OCTO’s 2025 OKRs**, including:  
  - Improved **task completion rates** (O1.1)  
  - Reduced **latency in accessing critical actions** (O1.2)  
  - Increased **cross-team adoption** (O2.4)  

## Launch Planning  
### **Collaboration Cycle**  
**Staging review will be required for adoption into VADS.**  
- Epic
- Kickoff ticket  
- Finalized Pattern  

### **Timeline**  

#### **Initiative Launch Dates**
