# Critical Alerts: Making Time-Sensitive Information Clear

## TL;DR  
Veterans need clear, actionable alerts for urgent tasks. Our research highlights gaps in current designs and offers recommendations for improving user experience.

## What We Did  
The Authenticated Experience Design Patterns team at OCTO conducted desk research to investigate how Veterans interact with time-sensitive alerts and notifications across VA.gov. The goal was to identify patterns, gaps, and opportunities for improving how critical information is displayed to Veterans.

## Key Insights  
- **Veterans prioritize clarity and urgency in alerts.**  
  - “I would want to see if there was something else I needed to do, or if everything I’ve submitted is sufficient for them to make a decision.” – P14  
- **Action links work best when tied to specific, active tasks.**  
  - “What to do next isn’t super clear. I don’t think it’s too much information, but maybe just a wording issue.”  
- **Overuse of alerts can lead to fatigue and confusion.**  
  - “Why—what did I do wrong? For me, being visually impaired, trying to find what part of the form is filled out wrong is kind of difficult.” – P10  

## Between the Lines  
This research underscores the importance of context and clarity. Alerts are most effective when they guide users toward immediate action, but overly generic or frequent alerts dilute their impact. The findings suggest that Veterans value simplicity but also need transparency about what actions are required.

## Yes, But  
While critical alerts are essential, there’s a risk of overwhelming users if alerts are overused. Balancing urgency and frequency will be key to ensuring Veterans trust and engage with these messages.

## Why It Matters  
This research ties directly into VA’s broader mission to improve the digital experience for Veterans. By surfacing the most critical information and making tasks easier to complete, the VA can enhance user satisfaction and align with OCTO’s key results around accessibility and usability improvements.

## What’s Next  
The team recommends developing a new alert component focused on urgent, time-sensitive tasks. This component should use clear, active language and guide users to take action. Next steps include usability testing to refine the component and ensure it meets Veterans’ needs.
