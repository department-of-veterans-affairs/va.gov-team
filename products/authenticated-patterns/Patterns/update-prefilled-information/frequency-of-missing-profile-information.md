# Missing Profile Data

## High-level Stats on Missing Contact Data

**Takeaway: 33% of VA profiles for living users are missing all contact information.**

The VA Profile team has provided us with some information about the prevalence of missing contact information in VA profiles.

This first graphic shows that there are roughly 35.54 million active VA profiles. Of these, 25.31 million (71%) have some form of contact data. Conversely, 29% of them are missing all contact information. This includes deceased users.

**Takeaway: Very few accounts have missing personal information. The most common piece of missing personal information is DOB, which is missing from 9% of living VA profiles.**

The below statistics were sent by Laura Kreisel of the VA profile team:

- Total living, active VA Profile IDs: 23,258,322 (we're unclear why this number does not match the number of total active profiles in the second graphic, but it's still userful)
- Living VA Profile IDs missing First Name, Last Name, and DOB: 0
- Living VA Profile IDs missing First Name only: 30,381 (1%)
- Living VA Profile IDs missing Last Name only: 3 
- Living VA Profile IDs missing DOB only: 205,380 (9%)
- Living VA Profile IDs missing First and Last Name: 0
- Living VA Profile IDs missing First Name and DOB: 661 
- Living VA Profile IDs missing Last Name and DOB: 0

The profile team is not an authoritative source of the SSN, so this was not sent to us.
