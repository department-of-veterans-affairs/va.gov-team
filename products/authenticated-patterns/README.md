### Our north star
Unlike most VFS teams, our goal isn't to ship a product on VA.gov. Our goal is to develop design patterns for the authenticated experience on VA.gov. We'll contribute them back to the VA Design System and the US Web Design System.

Our north star: Crafting evidence-based, adaptable and adoptable design patterns that will improve Veteran experiences across government digital services.
* Evidence-based: research based and data-driven
* Adaptable: flexible and reusable by teams
* Adoptable: easily adopted by other teams
* Design patterns: VADS and USWDS patterns
* Improve Veteran experiences: impactful improvements to Veteran workflows
* Across government digital services: extendable across many VA teams and other  federal agencies 

 Our work ultimately makes it easier for other teams to build personalized, consistent authenticated exeriences.
