## Feedback from Andrew Duthie
- Pre-filling forms: We have similar use-cases, some tied to account ("profile"), e.g. phone. Some are contextual, e.g. page language. I could see this pattern extending beyond just "profile" (AD)
- Pre-filling forms: If the information is already available as part of a person's profile, is it necessary to have this be a  field they're expected to  provide in a form? Is the bigger issue with ensuring accuracy of profile details?  (AD)
- Profile accuracy: Similar challenge at Login.gov, particularly in presenting  opportunities for user to update this information, if typical user flows would not bring them to an account management interface. Incorporate into user flows? Maybe this reinforces pattern of "pre-filling forms". (AD)
- Service history: How  do we define "service"? For VA, are  these physical interactions, and if so, would the pattern  extend to digital interactions? (AD)
- Personalized flows: Like the  idea, curious how to communicate page/flow changes effectively (especially for assistive  tech), and be transparent in outlining potential flows a user could expect to encounter based on their selections (AD)
- Auto-save alert: Ideally saving is not incremental such that a user could always trust that their details are saved immediately. With alerts, are these a different type of alert component, like a "Toast" (see card  link). In which case, would expect guidance around timing re: WCAG Timing Adjustable. (AD)
- Notifications: Would this require additional related patterns / components around something like an inbox of messages?  (AD)
- Sign-in: Like the inclusion of "moving across environments". Particularly for Login.gov, a pattern for helping a user feel confident through a change in websites (AD)

## Feedback from Nick Ng
- Pre-filling forms: This pattern could be helpful. In the past, when Login.gov UX  conducted usability testing with Veterans, there was a recurring indication that Veterans would expect the forms to display pre-filled details when creating a Login.gov account. (NN)
- Pre-filling forms: I am curious about how accessible a pre-filling field is when a user edits it. For example, does the focus event trigger the clearing of the pre-population text/value, or does the text/value remain intact for the  user to delete, edit, or append? Also, how much of a margin for  accidental updates, and how to  mitigate them? (NN)
- Profile accuracy: Like what AD said above, this is a similar challenge at Login.gov. As you dive into the research, I am curious about the information architecture or categories that might emerge, such as these, and how users understand how updates have downstream effects back to  the platforms & products
    - Personal information (Name, SSN, etc.)
    - Communication preferences
    - Email, text, voice notification
    - Languages, e.g., Spanish
    - Security preferences, e.g., MFAs
