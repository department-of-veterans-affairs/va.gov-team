## Research goals

The key goals of this study are to:

* Understand where and when users need the prefill alert to appear.
* Understand how users expect the prefilled data to display.
* Understand users' expectations around why certain data can be edited within their profile and other data cannot.
* Understand how users expect the edit process to work, look like, where they expect their edits to get saved, and if they want to be asked where to save their data.
 
## Research questions

Understand where and when users need the prefill alert to appear.
- Does the prefill alert in the unauthenticated experience entice them to sign in to complete the form?
- Where do they expect the prefill alert message to be located once they are authenticated?
- In what variation do they notice the prefill alert? Top of page? On the step pages?
- Does bolding the word ‘note’ make an impact on whether they will read the information?

Understand how users expect the prefilled data to display.
- Which version of the data display (address block vs gray card component) helps users to more quickly understand that it contains prefilled data?
- Do they notice the prefilled data where it is located on the page in either the address block or gray card component?

Understand users' expectations around why certain data can be edited within their profile and other data cannot.
- How do they feel about the ability to edit some data but not others?
- Is it clear how to edit data within the form? Is it clear how to edit data that is not editable on VA.gov?
- Does the user understand why some data is not editable?
- Does the explanation for why we limit edits to some user data increase user trust in VA?

Understand how users expect the edit process to work, look like, where they expect their edits to get saved, and if they want to be asked where to save their data.
- Where do they think the new information gets saved? (profile vs form)
- Would they ever want to choose where this information gets saved?
- Which type of prefilled data display do they prefer to see on the edit page? (in-field vs gray box)
- What content do users expect to see in the confirmation message after they have saved their data?


## Methodology

This was a moderated usability study conducted remotely over Zoom. We used a Codespace prototype for enhanced interactivity.

We presented scenarios testing the following variations:
- Location of the prefill alert on the page
- Location of the prefill alert within the form flow
- Bolding the word ‘Note’ or not
- Style of the component that housed the prefilled data
- Language describing why some data is uneditable on the site itself
- Edit process
- Location of ‘old’ data in the edit state
- Location updates saved 

## Hypotheses and conclusions

|Hypothesis|Conclusion|Explanation|
|:--|:--|:--|
|Bolding ‘note’ in the prefill alert messaging will help users to see a block of text quicker|Somewhat True|This was true except in cases where there were multiple blocks of text starting with the word ‘Note’.|
|Users will more easily notice the intro prefill alert when it’s at the top of the page. |Definitely True|Users preferred to see it at the top of the page.|
|We will learn that the user only needs the prefill alert on the Intro page|Definitely False|Users want to see the alert on the Intro page, but they also want to see it on the page with prefilled, editable information and the Edit screen as well|
|The users will prefer the address component over the gray box for the locked data|Likely False|There was a slight preference for the gray box over the address component, with one user specifically associating the color gray with ‘uneditable’ information.|
|Users understand why we limit in screen edits for some types of data and find the messaging around the reason to be sufficient|Definitely True|Most users understood why this information could not be edited online and appreciated the messaging around protecting their data|
|As long as the data is going back to their profile, they will not want to be asked if it is ok to update their profile|Likely False|Many participants expressed an interest in being able to choose where they want their changes to save.|
|Users will prefer to see in the field data instead of the locked gray box displaying their current data while they are editing. |Definitely True|8 out of 10 users preferred the inline text edit to the gray box.|
|Users want to be informed if their data is not updating to their profile.|Definitely True|Users cared a lot about being very clear on where their data and updates were saving|
|The confirmation alert will help users understand when their data has been updated. |Definitely True|Most participants read the alert text the first time and understood where their data would save.|
