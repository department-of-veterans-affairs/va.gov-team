# Research Plan for AEDP, Authenticated Experience Design Patterns, July 24, 2024
*Questions about how to set up your research study? Reach out in the #research-ops Slack channel.* 

## Background
Briefly describe the background of your product. Consider:
- We are trying to improve on the currently implemented prefill pattern so that it is optimized for wider adoption at VA and other government sites.
- We are working primarily within the authenticated experience.
- This is an existing product although not widely implemented at VA. However, the concept of prefill is common in authenticated website applications in general so familiarity with this experience may be ubiquitous.

### OCTO Objectives

Which [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme) does this research support? Increase the quality and reliability of VA services by the following:
- Enable easier implementation of form prefill across various VA.gov applications
- Promote consistency in how form pre-fill is implemented across the platform
- Lay the groundwork for future improvements in Veterans' form completion experience
- Facilitate more complete and up-to-date Veteran profiles as applications adopt this pattern
- Reduce the need for custom code related to form prefilling, leading to more maintainable and consistent applications

### Veteran Journey
Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)? Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features
Are there moments that matter? Yes. The moments that matter are 

## Research Goals	
What are you trying to learn from this research?
We are trying to learn the strengths and weaknesses in the user experience between the two different implementations of prefill we are testing.

*Pro tip: Limit 3 goals per study. If you have more than 3 goals, consider how to break up your research into iterative studies.* 

### Outcome
How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?

### Research questions
We will let them complete the tasks using a think aloud method. We will start with broader questions, then ask more specific questions if we did not get the answer to certain worries the first pass.
- What do you think happens when you edit your information? (to ask during edit process for both variations)
- What do you want to happen? (when they either edit, submit application, or regarding basic understanding of messaging)
- How do you feel about this experience of going to the next page? What would make you feel more secure? (can be used on edit variations, as well, as overall prefill experience)
- What do you think this message is telling you? (regarding the edit or prefill alerts)
- What should you do here? (regarding task to enter missing information or where not all information was in the profile)
- Do not write out all questions you plan to ask participants -- that should go in the [conversation guide.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/conversation-guide-template.md) 

### Hypothesis
What do you intend to learn and measure from this study?
- We know that the prefill function is common and that there are user expectations around this functionality.
- I think users will find prefill time saving and conenient, but they may have some confustion about how it is working and how to update the information on their profile.
- I believe one of the two design variations we test will prove to be less confusing and better meet the expectations of the user. 

## Method	
Describe the method you’re planning. You should be able to explain why this method is appropriate for the goals of the research and maturity of the design. 
- We will perform Usability testing - appropriate for evaluating structured design maturity. We will use the "think-aloud" format so that we can evaluate how the user is responding to the design as they perform a task we give them.

## Recruitment	

OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers. 

Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources. 
- [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/perigean-recruiting-guidance.md) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research. 
- [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.

### Recruitment approach
Who is your intended audience for this research (e.g. Veterans, caregivers, VSOs, SMEs), and how will you recruit them? 

Pro tip:
- For remote moderated studies with Veterans and caregivers, we recommend using Perigean to recruit participants. 
- Perigean cannot recruit VA employees or VSOs. Work with your VA lead to recruit these groups. 
- Perigean can also support remote, unmoderated studies, however, these studies require strict recruitment requirements. (Additional guidance forthcoming; reach out to #research-ops in the interim.)

Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Refer to the resources above to learn more. Read this [introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md) and use the [recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity.

### Recruitment criteria

Add the total requested number, ideal completed sessions and breakdown type of participants for this study. 

`Ex. TR: 10; CS: 6; Vets: 5; Fam: 0; Care: 5; Serv: 0`

|Total requested|Completed sessions|Veterans|Family Member|Caregivers|Service Members|
|:-------------:|:----------------:|:------:|:-----------:|:--------:|:-------------:|
|               |                  |        |             |          |               | 


### Criteria Table (Please read carefully)
What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study? 

- If this is for a single ***MODERATED*** study, breakdown your total requested participants for each category by number--***not percentage*** in the moderated column. 
- ***This will be applied across particpant types you need*** (*Veterans, caregivers, etc.*) for all categories (*Sex, race, etc*) you select. 
- For example, if you request 10 particpants, for 5 Veterans, and 5 caregivers, you could ask for 5 males, 5 females, and Perigean will apply those numbers across those two particpant types. Do the same for any other category you want Perigean to use for recruitment. You **do not** have to use every category, or even specific type in a catogory. Only add to the category/type that will make your study successful.
- ***Various*** means you want an array of participants from this category but are leaving it to Perigean's discretion to recruit as many different types as possible.
- If you choose ***Various*** for a category, but wish to exclude a specific type, place an **X** in it's row. However, you can choose ***Various*** and also specific types of a category to be included (Ex. Various 7, Black 3, White X.)
- For benefits category, you may also choose ***No Ben/Ser Exp*** which means you want particpants who haven't had experience using any Veteran benefit or service. In your additional screener section, you can specify exactly which benefit or service you want participants not to have had experience using. 
- For hardware category, select which type/s you want participants to join your session to use.
- If you're conducting an unmoderated study (*survey, tree test*) using cohorts, ***do not exceed*** nine participants per cohort to avoid PRA (Paperwork Reduction Act).
- Add which group you want applied to each cohort in the heading row (***Ex. Vet Cohort 1, Care Cohort 2, Fam Cohort 3, Serv Cohort 4***). 
- You can use the same group for all cohorts, but the categories you choose must vary (***Ex. Vet Cohort 1 [9 Male]; Vet Cohort 2 [9 Female]***.

**Identity Assurance Levels**

- **IAL1:** Attributes, if any, are self-asserted or should be treated as self-asserted; there is no proofing process. (***Ex., User generated user name and pw***)

- **IAL2:** Either remote or in-person identity proofing is required using, at a minimum, the procedures given in NIST SP 800-63A. (***Ex., Id.me or Login.gov account***)

- **IAL3:** In-person or supervised-remote identity proofing is required. Identifying attributes must be verified through examination of physical documentation as described in NIST SP 800-63A.

### Screener

Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants. Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question.
  
 > **Example:** Have you been to a VA urgent care facility in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]
  
 Additionally, you may provide instructions for Perigean to follow to ensure a smooth set-up.
  
 > **Example:** ALL have a computer, tablet, or smartphone and are willing to complete their interview on one of those devices:
  - During the session, are willing to share over Zoom a web browser window on their device
  - Have a working microphone on their device
  - Have Zoom downloaded to their device prior to the session and know how to share their screen

> Tip: The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria. Consider how you could leverage the [lean maximum variation sampling (MVS) approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md#lean-mvs-strategy) by breaking up criteria for your study into multiple cohorts that each isolate one primary criteria. Perigean will consider each cohort as a separate recruitment effort, increasing the chances of meeting all criteria for your study. [Go to an example of the multiple cohort approach.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/research/generative-research-study-1/2020-12.research-plan1.md#participants-and-recruitment)

## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session: 

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research:

### Length of sessions
* Session length: (e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours)
* Buffer time between sessions: (30 minutes recommended to reset between sessions, debrief with team, if a participant arrives late, or a session goes slightly over time) 

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. *Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.* 

Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
	
## Team Roles	
Please list the people who will be serving in each role. **Include the primary phone number for moderator and the emails for moderator, notetaker, and observers. If you need Perigean to take notes for you, indicate that next to Notetaker** 	
- Moderator:	
- Research guide writing and task development (usually but not always same as moderator):	
- Participant recruiting & screening:	
- Project point of contact:	
- Participant(s) for pilot test:	
- Note-takers:	
- Observers:	
**List email addresses for those who should attend and observe the sessions: VA Stakeholders, engineering team members, design team members, any other people who might find this research relevant to their work.** Spread observers across sessions so that there are no more than 5-6 total attendees (moderator, notetaker(s), observer(s)) per session on the VA side
