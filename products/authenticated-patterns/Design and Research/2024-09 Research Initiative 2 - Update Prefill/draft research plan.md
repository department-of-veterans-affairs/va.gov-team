## Background
Many applications on VA.gov prefill existing information from user profiles when users sign in. This saves Veterans time and effort in completing tasks, like applications. Our team reviews current and potential design patterns to improve implementation guidance. We want to make it easier for VFS teams to implement patterns and make implementation more consistent.

We've researched current instances of this pattern [in this Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1722538218743/e8a34db6e16086f9122fd2e0927edf5607bfa273?sender=u44efa807e992cacf10cf3697) so far. 

In this study, we'll test some these variations:
- Display style of both locked and editable data sets (Address vs Gray Box vs review card)
- Asking users where they prefer to save updated data (Profile and form vs Form only)
    - once per form
    - once per field
    - only certain fields
- Including a review step at the end of a form

### OCTO Objectives and Veteran Journey
This work supports [OCTO Objective 3](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202024.md).
- Our people are empowered with the knowledge and resources they need to make a sustained impact.

Because this design pattern can be used in many forms and digital products, the study fits into the [Veteran Journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/5fa2c0a1630337422de4e8f719cdcac3e391fe1a/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf#L2) throughout the full life cycle of the Veteran.

## Research Goals	
Goals for this research include:
- Understand how users expect the prefilled data to display.
- Understand users' expectations around why certain data can be edited within their profile and other data cannot.
- Understand if users want or need a confirmation step before submitting forms with prefilled data.
- Understand how users expect the edit process to work, where they expect their edits to get saved, and if they want to be asked where to save their data.
 

### Outcome
We will synthesize the data from this study and create a summary report of our learnings. This research will inform decisions around these two patterns our team is refining:
[Help users to... Know when their information is prefilled](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/tmf-auth-exp-design-patterns/issues/17)
[Help users to... Update prefilled information](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/tmf-auth-exp-design-patterns/issues/22)
This research will help us refine these patterns and to feel confident in our recommendations for these patterns when we submit them to VADS and USWDS.


### Research questions
We will guide participants to complete the tasks using a think-aloud method.

*Goal 1: Understanding how users expect the prefilled data to display.*

*Goal 2: Understand users' expectations around why certain data can be edited within their profile and other data cannot.*
- How do they feel about the ability to edit some data but not others?
- Does the user understand why some data is not editable?
- Does the explanation for why we limit edits to some user data increase user trust in VA?

*Goal 3: Understand if users want or need a confirmation step before submitting forms with prefilled data.*

*Goal 4: Understand how users expect the edit process to work and where they expect their edits to get saved.*
- Where do they think the new information gets saved? (profile vs form)
- Would they ever want to choose where this information gets saved? 
- What content do users expect to see in the confirmation message after they have saved their data?

### Hypotheses

## Methodology	
We will perform usability testing on X scenario-based concept tests - appropriate for evaluating structured design maturity. We will use the think-aloud format so that we can evaluate how the user is responding to the design as they perform a task we give them. We will show the three tasks to each participant and change the order of the tasks shown to avoid the first view bias.

### Location

We will hold the research sessions remotely on Zoom.

## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach

We are looking for 8 Veterans to participate in this study. Weâ€™ll use a lean maximum strategy for inclusivity, targeting 3 demographic criteria (age, gender, race) as primary sample distribution criteria, and race/ethnicity as a secondary sample distribution criteria.

### Recruitment criteria
12 Veterans (includes a 1.5x over recruit)

### Screener Questions

#### Primary criteria (must-haves)

- 50% of participants must be willing to join from their mobile devices for the study
	- Are you able to join the Zoom session from a smartphone such as a Samsung Galaxy or iPhone? Any kind of smartphone will work as long as it connects to the internet [Yes/No]
- At least 5 Veterans who are over 55 years old.
- At least 4 Veterans who identify as having a cognitive disability.
	- Do you find it difficult to remember or learn new things, focus on a task, or make decisions? We ask this question because we want to make sure that our tools work for people who live with challenges like these.
		- Response options: yes or no (Answering yes would qualify the participant.)
- At least 3 Veterans who identify as a gender other than male. 
- At least 2 Veterans who are under 35 years old. 
- At least 1 Veteran who lives in a rural area.

## Timeline

### Prepare
**When will the thing you are testing be finalized?**



**Pilot session information**

Two options available, depending on when recruiting can schedule participants.

- Pilot participant email: 
- Date and time of pilot session: 

### Research sessions
**Planned dates of research:**



### Length of sessions

- Session length: 1 hour
- Buffer time between sessions: 30 minutes
- Maximum sessions per day: 3

### Availability

The least preferred day to schedule participants is Thursday, September 5th as one of our researchers is out on Thursdays, but we wanted to provide lots of extra availability just in case. Thanks!
