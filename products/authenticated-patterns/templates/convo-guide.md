## Intro
#### Estimated timing: 5 min
> Start transcript: `LIVE TRANSCRIPT` > `ENABLE`

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes. How are you?

I’m a researcher from VA. Our team works on improving VA.gov so that Veterans have a better experience getting benefits and services from the VA.

Before we get started, when Perigean set up this session, they asked if you’re okay with a couple of observers joining us. This helps my team members learn from our conversation as well, and they also help me take notes so we capture everything you share.

So, I want to confirm now, are you okay with a couple of my teammates joining us to observe?
- IF NO,
> Use Slack to let observers know.
- IF YES, They're in the waiting room, so I'm going to let them into the meeting now.
> Let in observers from the waiting room.

Welcome. Can everyone say hello? This is [PARTICIPANT].

Thanks everyone, now I’ll ask you to turn off your cameras and mute yourselves for the rest of the session.

There are a few other things I want to mention before we start:

- This session should take about an hour. I’ll make sure we finish on time, so I will sometimes go ahead and ask a specific question about your experience with the site to move us along and make sure we are getting the information we need.
- We’re here to learn your honest opinions. Negative feedback is helpful too, because it helps us learn how we can improve.
- I also want to make it clear that we’re not testing your ability. So, for example, if I ask if you understand something, it’s because I want to make sure the writing is clear or if I ask you whether you know what you should do, it is because I am wondering if the design is effective in that spot.
- I’m going to share a prototype with you today. This is like a test version of the website, so it may not work exactly how you expect. For example, you’ll be able to click some buttons, but not all of them.
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, you just have to let me know. And that might be a pause to get some water or to stop the session completely. You'll be paid even if we don't complete the full session.

The last thing is about recordings. We can record the session to help us confirm we captured your opinions accurately and sometimes share video clips with our colleagues at VA. If we do this, we don’t link anything you share in the session to any information that could identify you. We remove your face and your name from the videos. Knowing this, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
- IF NO,
> Don't record
- IF YES, Once I start recording, I’ll confirm again.

>Start recording: RECORD TO CLOUD.

I’ve started recording. I'd like to confirm again: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Warm-up
#### Estimated timing: 5 min
It seems like we’re ready to get started. I'd like to begin by learning more about your experience with the VA and our online services.


- I’m curious how long you’ve been a Veteran?
- How often, if at all, do you use VA.gov?
- Do you have a VA.gov account?

   If YES:
    - What has been your experience with logging in to the site?
    - What do you typically do on VA.gov after you log in?
   
   If NO: 
    - How would having an account change your experience on VA.gov?

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Things to watch for:
> - If they have not logged into the site before and why?
> - Whether any of their past experience involves an issue updating their profile data?


Thanks, it’s helpful to learn about your experience with the VA.

Next, I’d like to share our prototype to get your feedback. I am going to give you some tasks to complete. While you are doing a task, I want you to tell me your thoughts and impressions as they occur. This is called the “think-aloud” method, and it will give us insights into your experience with this site.

In the Zoom chat, I'm going to send you a link to a prototype. I mentioned earlier a prototype is like a test version of a website. It might not work perfectly, but this way we can learn what we need to improve before we share it with more Veterans.

Can you open the link in the chat?

Have you shared your screen on Zoom before?

IF YES: Great. Can you please share your screen now?
  
IF NO: I’ll walk you through how to do that…

Thanks! Now I’m able to see your screen too.

Great! Thank you for your thoughts on all of that. That brings us to the end of this task. I have a few follow up questions before we move onto the next task.

## Closing
#### Estimated time: 5 min
Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. 

We just have a few remaining questions for you before we wrap up:
> [Skip any of these that were already addressed by the participant in conversation]

- question 1
- question 2

Awesome, thanks so much for your opinion on these options. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on VA.gov and make sure it really works for Veterans. 

In general, I’d love to hear what you think about your overall experience - being scheduled for this research session, participating in the research session. Could we have done anything differently/better?

I wanted to check back in about our recording. Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences. So I want to re-confirm that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners? 
- IF YES: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?

Do you have any final questions for me?

Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Pause or exit strategies

We can use these strategies to prepare for difficult situations.

### If the participant isn't feeling well

I'm sorry you're [not feeling well]. Do you feel up for continuing? You'll be paid even if we stop early.

> If they choose to continue...

Okay, just let me know if you change your mind.

### If the participant is showing signs of upset or distress

This sounds so hard. Would you like to take a break or stop?

> If they choose to take a break and come back...

Welcome back. I'm interested to hear more about [topic you left off on]. Are you up for continuing or would you prefer we move to the next topic?

### If the participant decides to stop

Thank you for your time today, I completely understand your decision to stop.

> If they seem distressed...

Before you go, the VA Hotline number is 988, it's a confidential helpline, and it's 24/7. It's up to you whether you call.

### If the participant is fine to continue, but you aren't

I hear that you're okay to continue. Before we do, I realized that I need a minute. I'm going to turn off my camera and microphone, and get a glass of water. Is that okay with you? I'll be back in 3 minutes.

> If you're still not able to continue, after you pause...

Thanks for letting me take a break. You didn't do anything wrong, but I'm realizing that I'm not going to be able to continue this session. You will still be paid for the full time. I really appreciate you sharing with me today. Is it okay with you if we stop? Thanks very much.
