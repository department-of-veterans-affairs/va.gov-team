# VA.gov Developer Tools Panel Analysis

## Main Summary
The VADX Panel provides VA.gov engineers, developers, and designers with a unified interface for common development tasks like feature toggle management, form navigation, and accessibility tools. This panel aims to streamline the development workflow by consolidating frequently used tools and controls into a single, easily accessible interface within the browser. Extensibility is also available through a plugin component that opens the door for each application team to build their own set of tools or shortcuts.

## Implementation Overview
The panel is implemented as a React component that wraps VA.gov applications. It appears as a small button in the bottom right corner of the screen during local development, expanding into a side docked panel when activated. The panel is designed to coexist with the main application without interfering with existing functionality. The panel is currently designed to be used on desktop sized screens for maximum usability.
Screenshots and code details can be reviewed in [PR #33216](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/pull/33216)

### Key Technical Decisions
- The panel is conditionally rendered based on environment (currently localhost only) and a feature toggle value that each team will provide. If the team does not want to integrate a specific feature toggle to use for their application, we may build in an override, but at this point it should be unique for each team.
- Implementation uses React context for state management and for providing a common set of api functions.
- Code is split into a separate bundle to minimize impact on the main application. The VADX panel only loads it's bundle locally and is not present in production environments
- State persistence is handled through browser storage for maintaining toggle settings. IndexedDB is utilized for this so that local storage is free to be used for application specific persistance.

## Core Features

### Feature Toggle Management
The panel provides real-time control over feature toggles, allowing developers to:
- View all available feature toggles in their environment
- Toggle features on/off with immediate UI feedback
- Search through available toggles
- Reset toggles to their default states
- Load toggle states from the development environment endpoint

### Form Development Tools
The current implementation focuses on form navigation and discovery:
- Displays all available form routes within the application
- Provides direct navigation between form routes
- Highlights the currently active route
- Future iterations will expand to include form state visualization and data manipulation

### Accessibility Debugging Tools
The panel includes tools for identifying and debugging accessibility concerns:
- Focus Element Debugger: Shows which element currently has focus and provides visual indication in the DOM when debugger is hovered.
- Heading Hierarchy Analysis:
	- Displays a heading hierarchy tree with an overview of all headings present on a page.
	- Examines heading structure and identifies common issues such as:
	  - Skipped heading levels
	  - Multiple H1 tags
	  - Missing H1 tags

### Extensibility
The panel supports custom functionality through a plugin system:
- Teams can add their own tab with custom functionality
- Plugin implementation requires minimal setup
- Custom plugin tab integrates seamlessly with the core panel interface

## Initial Feedback and Validation
Early demonstrations to engineering teams have yielded positive feedback on the panel's utility and placement. Further validation is scheduled with a broader group of engineers to gather additional insights and feature requests.

## Future Considerations

### Potential Feature Expansions
- Integration of axe testing capabilities for on-demand accessibility testing
- Enhanced form debugging and manipulation tools
- Possible expansion to staging environment access
- Additional accessibility debugging features

### Technical Considerations
- Performance monitoring may be needed if deployed to staging environment
- Potential expansion of plugin system capabilities
- Integration with additional development tools and services

## Implementation Requirements

### Technical Requirements
- Feature toggle must be provided via props
- Environment detection for conditional rendering
- React 16.8+ for context and hooks support
- Compatible with React Router for form navigation

### Usage Requirements
- Panel must be wrapped around the application root
- Feature toggle name must be provided
- Optional plugin component can be provided for custom functionality

## Recommendations
1. Proceed with the current MVP implementation for initial release to development teams
2. Gather structured feedback from the upcoming engineering review session
3. Prioritize form tools expansion based on developer feedback
4. Consider performance monitoring tools if staging deployment is pursued
5. Document plugin development guidelines for team customization

## Next Steps
1. Complete validation with broader engineering team
2. Document usage guidelines and best practices
3. Create plugin development documentation
4. Plan next iteration of form development tools
5. Evaluate expansion to staging environment
