## Overview
This form is part of the “11 forms by November 11 Initiative” — a fast track effort to deliver a bare bones MVP to digitize forms in under 12 weeks on VA.gov. The objective is to allow Veterans and their physician(s) to provide evidence of a Veteran’s medical condition and functional status to justify Aid & Attendance or Housebound benefits, which increase monthly compensation or pension benefits.

## Problem Statement
A Veteran or their beneficiary who needs daily assistance or is housebound due to a disability can complete VA Form 21-2680 "Examination for Housebound Status or Permanent Need for Regular Aid and Attendance" to request increased benefits. The form requires completion by both the Veteran/beneficiary and the Veteran’s physician.  

Current challenges:
- Landing page (https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-21-2680/) provides minimal guidance.  
- Paper form is error-prone, often incomplete, and not accessible.  
- No multiparty routing or submission tracking.   

**How might we provide a way for both Veterans and their physicians to supply this information so benefits can be processed faster?**  

MVP excludes multiparty signatures; focus is on digitization, improved landing content, and Veteran pre-fill.  

## Desired User Outcomes

- Veterans understand why they are filling out this form.  
- Veterans feel guided and supported.  
- Veterans and physicians can submit the form for Aid & Attendance benefits.  

## Undesired User Outcomes

- Veterans will prefer submitting their request for Aid and Attendnace benefits via the paper form 

## Desired Business Outcomes

- VBA staff process requests faster with fewer errors.  
- Veterans receive better guidance.  

## Undesired Business Outcomes

- There is an increased time in processing requests

## Measuring Success


### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- % of submissions online vs paper  
- Error rate  
- Rejection rate  
- Completion rate  
- Abandon rate  


#### Baseline KPI Values
* _Baseline values for those most critical metrics. These may come from other systems other than VA.gov e.g. eBenefits._

### Objectives and Key results (OKRs)
_What are the measurable targets you're aiming for that delivers value for Veterans?_

- Objective: Decrease adjudication/processing time  
  - KR: Reduce error rate  
  - KR: Reduce rejection rate

## Assumptions
- MVP is limited, with intent to add multiparty routing in future iterations.  

## Solution Approach

- Build MVP to digitize Veteran side, improve content.  
- Contractually bound by November 11 initiative.  
- Future: multiparty routing + signatures.  

### Supporting research

- Past research available for landing page content.  
- Formal research scheduled post-launch.
