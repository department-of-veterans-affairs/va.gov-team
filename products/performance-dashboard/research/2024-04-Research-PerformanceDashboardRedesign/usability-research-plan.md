# Research Plan for IIR, Performance Dashboard, Apr 24, 2024

## Background

- With this project we plan to increase the value of the Performance Dashboard as measured by VA employee usage.
- This product is located in the footer and can be accessed by both authenticated and unauthenticated users.
- This is an iteration on an existing tool. Veterans are not the primary user of this tool.

### OCTO Priorities 

This initiative aligns with the OCTO goal to ensure that “our people are empowered with the knowledge and resources they need to make a sustained impact”. The performance Dashboard Helps anyone see the results of VA.gov.

### Veteran Journey
The Primary persona of this initiative is a leader at the VA who is responsible for evangelizing or promoting the work done on VA.gov. 

## Research Goals	
- Does the proposed design tell the story our primary persona wants to tell?
- Does the proposed design show the right data to tell that story?
- Does the proposed design show the graphs and other data to support that story?
- Do users prefer the Performance Dashboard as it currently exists, the new Dashboard, or do they have no preference


### Outcome
This research will help us know if we have properly identified our primary persona’s problems and if we are on the right track to addressing them. The understanding we get from this research will help us know if we need to make additional iterations to the proposed designs or if we are ready to move on to implementation.

### Research questions

- Which aspects of the presented design will help you in your communication. What is detracting from it?
- Is there additional data that would help you tell that story?
- Is there data here that should be removed?

### Hypothesis

We hypothesize that this new design will enhance the value of the Performance Dashboard to VA employees. After the redesign the Performance Dashboard will become a valuable asset that VA employees will share to help communicate the value that VA.gov is adding. We will see an increase in the amount of traffic and in the number of shared links to this page.

## Methodology	

We plan to conduct a usability test where we compare the current version of the Performance Dashboard against the new design. This approach will help us determine the validity of our hypothesis. From this study we will be able to get qualitative feedback to ascertain whether the new design or the old design are a better communication tool.

### Location

We will be conducting remote zoom meetings for these usability tests.

### Research materials

For moderated usability tests:

### Recruitment approach

Our audience for this research is: 
## Primary Persona:
A VA employee (not OCTO) that wants to see statistics relevant to their work. (Eg VEO employee reporting to OMB on VA.gov. Similar to the Secretary/OCTO dashboards. Audience is internal to VA)
## Secondary Persona: 
Internal Product stakeholder who’s product could be represented on the dashboard. Could be either a VA product owner or a VFS product manager.


Our team will reach out and schedule zoom calls with these individuals.


### Recruitment criteria
We plan to have 5 participants in this study composed of VA employees who communicate VA.gov statistics or OCTO employees who work closely with the VA employees.
