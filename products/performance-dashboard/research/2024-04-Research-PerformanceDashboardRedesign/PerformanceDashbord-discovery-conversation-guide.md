# Performance Dashboard Discovery Conversation Guide


## Objective:

We want to make sure that we are designing the performance dashboard in such a way that it will meet the needs of our customers.


## Who are our customers?

We have identified a few Personas that this product will impact. 

**Primary Persona:**\
A VA employee (not OCTO) that wants to see statistics relevant to their work. (Eg VEO employee reporting to OMB on VA.gov. Similar to the Secretary/OCTO dashboards. Audience is internal to VA)

**Secondary Persona:** \
Internal Product stakeholder who’s product could be represented on the dashboard. Could be either a VA product owner or a VFS product manager.

**Tertiary Persona:** \
Veterans who happen upon the product dashboard. And members of congress.


## Who will we be able to have discovery calls with?

Getting a call with one of our Primary personas will be difficult. We will, however, be able to strategically pick some. 

These people will include:

- Jonathan Katora <jonathan.katora@va.gov> (He is someone in VA outside of OCTO(Persona 1), Jeff is familiar with him and his values align with Jeffs. He understands UX research)

- Chris Johnston (in a call where I will be a fly on the wall and possibly ask some light questions, this is TBD, Pete will try to be ready for this conversation by March 15)(primary persona but in OCTO, he is an outlier, he is responsible for every bit of data that goes on the performance dashboard)

- Pete will set up a dry run with Jeff in about a week's time then we will schedule a meeting with Jonathan three days after we get feedback from Jeff (either async or in person) Chris Johnson convo will happen in the next three weeks.


## What do we want to learn from our discovery calls?

Since we are focusing on the “what”, focusing on the job to be done is appropriate. (as opposed to focusing on the “how” with a user story).

**_With Primary Persona:_** 

Research Question 1: How does our primary persona **use internal VA.gov data**?

- How often do they **use internal VA.gov data**?

- Why do they **use internal VA.gov data**?

- **Which data** do they use?

- **When** do they **need the data**?

- How do they **access that data**? 

  - Do they have to work with another person to access the data they need?

  - Do they use any tools to support data manipulation/cleaning?

  - What device do they use?

- If they don’t …. 

Research Question 2: What pain points do people face when **interacting with internal VA data**?

- How they **access it**

- How they **interpret it**

- How they **share data**

Research Question 3: Does the perceived value of the current metrics align with their actual value (eg. if the persona expects the login count to be total sign ins to be all sign ins that is not aligned with reality) 

Research Question 4: Should we remove or add metrics to the Performance Dashboard?\
**_With Secondary Persona Requirements:_** We would like to have some understanding of how and why this persona uses the product currently so we do not remove any valuable functionality. Research questions for the secondary personas are the same as the research questions for the primary persona.

**_Data questions_**

- Can we look and see what Internal Product stakeholder traffic currently comes to this page?

**_With Tertiary Persona_:** We would like to have some understanding of how and why this persona uses the product currently so we do not remove any valuable functionality.

- Since meeting with Veterans is so time intensive we would like to hold of on interviewing them until after meeting with our primary and secondary personas and after we have determined what changes need to happen. 

**_Data Questions_**

- Can we look and see what Veteran traffic currently comes to this page?

**_Questions to ask Veteran facing VA reps_**

- Ask internal VA folk if they every direct Veterans to this page and why


# Discovery Test Script for Performance Dashboard

## Session Overview

Total time - 45 minutes

**Section A: Welcome and introduction (5 minutes)** The moderator will explain the purpose of the discovery session, present ground rules, and build rapport with the participant.

# Simplified Discovery Test Script for Performance Dashboard
