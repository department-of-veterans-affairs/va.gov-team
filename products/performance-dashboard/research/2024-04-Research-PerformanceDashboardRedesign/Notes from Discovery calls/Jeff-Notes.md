****

Initial Cause for Looking at the Dashboard

- Presentation for reporting cycle - Status Updates

****

Presentation Cadence

- There are alot of reasons, there are dozen of data calls per day; some of the data calls

****

Purpose Idea - Reduce the human labor involved in answer data calls about VA.gov metrics by people who are not in VA.gov

****

People who respond to data calls

- Jeff

- Chris Johnston

- Michelle

****

Can we PDF a SS of the dashboard; Can we get parity between current PDFs and the dashboard view

****

Goals:
