**Role/Title:** Software Engineer

Intro



* What is your title, and who do you generally interface with?
    * Part of the VA.gov IIR team- rapid improvement to products that are in between teams. Breadth and depth with high impact is our goal.
* In your role have you used the Performance Dashboard? Can you share a little about that experience?
    * Has made updates to the Performance Dashboard but doesn’t use it for its intended/functional purpose.
    * Shares out dashboard for development purposes rather than sharing the dashboard to actually view the data and numbers

Current State



* What would you say the purpose of this page is?
    * Doesn’t actually know the overall purpose. By looking at it, it’s not super obvious but after looking at numbers and topics, you can kind of make sense of a few things.
* Is there any content on this page that is unclear to you?
    * As an unfamiliar visitor of this page it feels very context dependent. For a general user, it’s not particularly clear what the numbers mean.
    * What is a VA.gov service? No idea what a service is.
    * What do “users” actually mean? Users could be visitors, people who have enrolled, etc.
    * When viewing arrows- apparently there is an increase? Is that good? Was unsure what story they were trying to tell.
    * Overall no context to this page. Takes some time to make assumptions about the data displayed.
    * “Performance dashboard” sentence case is bothersome 
    * Doesn’t know what transactions are
    * Took some time to find the service definitions- commented that those should be front and center because context is important to even remotely understand what the data means.
    * Service definitions give definition but they don’t tell us why those measures are meaningful and important
    * User satisfaction: he’s interested in how the user feedback is being solicited?
* Valuable score from John: neutral, 3: it’s not meant for me, it’s not designed for me so I don’t have an opinion.

Things to watch for



* How long does it take the participant to describe the purpose of the page? Do they seem confident or unsure?
    * They seem unsure. It took them some time to poke around and try and figure out what certain numbers were trying to represent.

Future State



* Looking at this page, what would you say the purpose of this page is?
    * To view how each segment of the VA is performing based on usage and satisfaction scores
    * Love the new name: “Summary of VA.gov usage”. Feels like it already is giving more context
* Take some time to explore the page and share your thoughts as you go.
        * Page is for VA.gov. A lot more obvious. And very clear that its focused on usage
        * Notices two tabs about year vs month so knows he’ll be looking at the year
        * The paragraph summary under highlights make sense and is helpful
    * Activity Highlights
        * Form submissions make a lot more sense than transactions. Still unsure why those are measured but it’s less ambiguous
        * The graph is a little bit harder to interpret. It’s trying to show a lot at once- totals with breakdowns. May not be the best way to display better but can see where it’s coming from.
            * Pie charts would be better for breakdown but it doesn’t work for showing over time. 
        * The HCA gray color seems to be glossed over because it’s not a bold color like the rest
        * Doesn’t know what HCA submission is/stands for
        * Up arrow/green color gives a positive association so assumes those are good numbers?.
    * Traffic Highlights
        * Likes to see the use of red down arrows- that must mean that is not good. Gives more context.
        * The line charts don’t really say much since there isn’t any axis present.
        * This bar chart seems easier to read because there are less subcategories.
    * Customer Satisfaction
        * Looks like we’re all of a sudden redefining users as customers so that’s kind of confusing
        * Customers feels more private sector rather than government focused
        * Line chart still looks good. Seems like it’s a good way to display the data to see satisfaction rise over time.
            * The gray color is disappearing
            * The jumps could seem less impactful as numbers rise and lower because it’s hard to move the needle on a single point
        * Is interested in how many customers are giving feedback to each category and how the feedback is collected.
    * Usage Details page
        * Doesn’t know what actions are (Action name).
        * Knows this page is more technical for people who want this type of granularity.
        * Wanted to use the Show all benefit types dropdown. 
* Is there any content on this page that is confusing or unclear?
    * There’s still not a story to go along with “activities” but it is more clear than the previous “transactions”
        * Wants to know why these things determine success
* Are there any tasks you could perform with this dashboard that you would not be able to do with the current performance dashboard?
    * Yes, it’s easier to find your way and focus on what you’re looking at. Likes the Usage details section.
* Are there any metrics or other content that you would like to see on this page that is not on this page?
    * None at this time.
* If the graphs were removed and there was only numerical content would that make you more or less interested in the page?
    * Less interested if there were no graphs
* Valuable score from John: 3, neutral again because he doesn’t functionally use this page.

Closing



* My last question for you is my favorite. Imagine if you had a magic wand, and could wave it around and make this page absolutely perfect for you. What might you change?
    * Because John is neutral he doesn’t have strong opinions but he likes that we display the categories together rather than individually. Focus is on the overall general performance.
* Are there other people you work with who use VA.gov metrics or the Performance Dashboard who you think would like to share their insights with us?
    * Nick!


#### **Name:** Michelle Correll & Tyler (Ty) Brettnacher

**Date:** May 7,2024

**Role/Title:**

* Michelle- Leads communication efforts across OCTO. Primarily internal and external comms. She gets a lot of data requests and is responsible for answering them. Reports on metrics to people outside of OCTO and links Performance Dashboard as a reference source. 
* Ty- Content designer for OCTO communications. Does graphic and communication designs as well as data and visualization building. He compiles monthly data reports and also handles the ad hoc data requests. 

Intro



* In your role have you used the Performance Dashboard? Can you share a little about that experience?
    * Michelle- primarily uses the dashboard to fill out monthly metrics dashboard to show VA stakeholders and leadership. She doesn’t reference it to pull data very often because it wasn’t accurate and they couldn’t manipulate the data. Leadership likes 18 month timeframes and the dashboard can’t do that. So she just sends external people to the dashboard mainly.
    * Ty- he’s been primarily using Domo for data requests because it's more consistent and accurate. Has no control over date ranges on the dashboard. He is mostly focused on the monthly product insights document. 

Current State



* What would you say the purpose of this page is?
    * Michelle- to highlight a variety of actions that users are taking when signed into VA.gov
    * Ty- to view the high level metrics and performance of VA.gov
* Is there any content on this page that is unclear to you?
    * Michelle 
        * Yes. Most of it. There’s no definition as to what these terms mean. The numbers are also not accurate because it’s not signed-in users. Things can be taken out of context and then they are asked to explain them.
        * There’s no benchmark on what metrics are normal and what we consider successful.
        * Transactions: people assumed this is signed-in users. Often things are getting interpreted out of context.
    * Ty 
        * Echoes what Michelle said about definitions and terms they use. It’s tricky to have this and Domo because there are slight differences in the words they’re using to describe the same numbers. 
        * He wants to see more graphs and breakdowns. It is text heavy so it’s easy to get lost in the numbers rather than looking at the data.
* Valuable score:
    * Michelle- 2
    * Ty- 1, not being able to customize date ranges makes it completely useless to him.

Future State



* Looking at this page, what would you say the purpose of this page is?
    * Michelle 
        * This is definitely a better show of our products. 
        * The organization is much more meaningful and context focused. It tells people that “we value activity and traffic and satisfaction”. 
        * Very good tool to view percent changes. 
        * Way more user friendly and telling a better story. 
        * No longer a random assortment of data points. 
    * Ty 
        * Echoes that there is a better story and organizational structure. 
        * More “scannable” and more visually appealing.
* Take some time to explore the page and share your thoughts as you go.
    * Michelle
        * Initial reaction was that the page is a lot more direct which she loves. Love that the summary is first. Context is helpful. 
        * Love the year and month filtering
        * Like the visual aspects
        * Have Traffic be first and then Activity. Tells a better story and makes it more user focused. 
    * Ty
        * Thinking about hierarchy- unsure if the data at the top is the most important to have on top. Agree to swap traffic and activity.
        * Love how visual it is. Like the different types of graphs.
        * Like the year and month and that you can go between them. 
        * This is going to be a lot more useful than what is currently there.
* VA.gov Activity Graph
    * Remove goal lines- Michelle doesn’t want to post OCTO OKR goals on a public facing page. 
    * Michelle wants to see actual specific numbers. Both totals and in the category breakdowns. Maybe when you hover a number pops up? 
    * Ty prefers the bar graph over a potential line graph.
    * What would you want to see? High level or specific interactions?
        * Focus on general performance and if people want specifics we can iterate
        * Highlight the bigger categories or highlight the things that are being significantly used the most.
        * We should tell THEM a story and just showing all of the details doesn’t do that. This should be the place that showcases how successful we are.
    * As far as activity goes, what would you highlight?
        * Maybe have another box that talks about total transactions? 
        * Maybe breakdown downloads- what are people downloading?
* Is there any content on this page that is confusing or unclear?
    * Need more definitions on the terminology to build context
    * Activity vs traffic- maybe we could call out the difference somehow. How are activity highlights and traffic highlights different? Be more straightforward.
    * Add text below each heading. An intro to each section so they know how to interpret the data.
    * Michelle- Chris is really wanting a page that focuses on users. Users need to be the main story. 
    * Switch Signed-in verified with total va.gov sessions
    * We don’t need Total search events but they are reporting on it right now.
        * Get rid of total search events?
* Are there any metrics or other content that you would like to see on this page that is not on this page?
    * Mobile numbers- they get a lot requests for mobile
        * Example: Health and benefits mobile app usage
* Can you rely on this page to communicate the things you need?
    * Michelle- missing the accordion with definitions: what do we mean by sessions vs. signed in, forms submissions, downloads. Then she could rely more on this page
    * Ty- echo definitions. Before publishing though, he wants to align with us on what terminology to use.
    * Michelle can see a world where they could screenshot things on this page instead of creating their own graphs and charts. This is much easier to grab numbers she needs. Quick reference. Domo is not easy for quickly getting info.
* What other timeframe filtering do they want?
    * Quarterly numbers will be important
    * Add the last twelve months and change this year to YTD
    * More often people care about the last twelve months vs YTD
* Observation notes
    * Neither one of them called out the Usage Details section of the Download PDF/Share Link buttons
* Valuable Score: 
    * Michelle- 4
    * Ty- 3 as is, 4 with some changes

Action items 



* Include Michelle and Ty in the Chris J session.


#### **Name:** Jonathan Katora

**Date:** May 8,2024

**Role/Title:** Business Relationship Manager. Customer advocate for VEO(Veteran Experience Officer)?  Advocates for customers, provides guidance, and helps shape demand in those spaces to help make sure we’re providing the best service possible.

Intro



* In your role have you used the Performance Dashboard? Can you share a little about that experience?
    * Doesn’t use the dashboard in his current role yet.
    * Has shared out the dashboard with a few people who were looking for different places that metrics are available- George Ladington BAM? 

Current State



* What would you say the purpose of this page is?
    * To show performance of various metrics about VA.gov
* Is there any content on this page that is unclear to you?
    * He doesn’t think there is any content that is unclear
* Valuable score: 3, it’s valuable for a quick pulse check on where things are at. 

Future State



* Looking at this page, what would you say the purpose of this page is?
* Take some time to explore the page and share your thoughts as you go.
    * Tried to click download PDF button
        * If we could build out a report on the main page and then download it, that could be great. But also okay if the download button was just exporting all of the data without any filtering/sorting.
    * Share Link is not necessary to him. Already straightforward enough to copy the url manually. Majority of users probably wouldn’t use Share Link and even then maybe only on mobile 
    * He was expecting an x axis on line graphs so he can derive more insights and potential correlation.
    * He was expecting that hovering his mouse over graphs and charts would give him more specific numbers and details.
    * Said VA.gov activity by type is interesting- “did we arbitrarily choose form submissions, downloads, view of benefits?” Thought that those could be filters for the VA.gov activity graph- radio button or drop down, essentially giving more manipulation function.
    * The current performance dashboard top level metrics make more sense being on top. Maybe don’t have activity first.
    * Break out the graph by administrations/benefit types instead of activity types. 
    * Would love additional data like how much time users are spending filling out a form and doing those different activities.
    * Usage Details is helpful to filter by benefits type. That’s what he is really interested in.
    * The Usage Details page isn’t necessary if you can just have a high level benefit type filter for the entire highlights page.
        * Wishes he could interact with the Usage Details on the highlights page
    * Sr leaders all want the top level info but almost always follow up with breaking things down so why not just show more details.
        * Need a way to drill down into the information
    * Satisfaction rating is more top level so bring that up higher. 
    * Idea: hyperlink main cards (traffic, activity, satisfaction) that you can expand and see more into about.
        * Would like to do less scrolling and more interaction
        * More dynamic experience with more collapsed sections- initially thought that activity was the only important metric because it was at the top.
* Would you use the dashboard with its redesign?
    * Unsure. He thinks he can reference this page conversationally but would probably still make reports in domo/GA for presentations.
    * As is, he still needs to dig deeper on all of the data. This would not totally satisfy his needs.
    * In reality, the employees that care about the highlights metrics and just OIT. VEO cares but they have their own ways to capture metrics. The Usage Details page is more relevant outside OIT and could get more traction across business units.
* Do any of the metrics or other content on this page stand out to you?
    * The Read reviews link stood out. Likes the idea to click into more stuff.
* Are there any metrics or other content that you would like to see on this page that is not on this page?
    * He wants time based charts. Ex: we rolled out this new thing so we expect to see an uptick on activity around that same time. Want to be able to see those correlations.
    * A roll up of activity is not being asked for in his experience which is why he likes Usage details.
    * Idea: Hyperlink Benefit Types on Usage Details page to learn more about that benefit type. He wants to be able to dig down into each and see exactly what’s going on.
    * He doesn’t know who the audience would be for him on the highlights page. He can see a lot more people using Usage Details because you can have conversations around that data. Especially if you can click into each benefit type and see more.
    * Sorting after filtering by benefit type doesn’t seem necessary on the Usage Details page. Especially because it might not be more than ten rows. 
    * Usage Details is very activity focused- could be good to include more details like top ten viewed pages or something similar. It would help people identify where and how users are actually spending their time. Actions are not always the end all be all. 
        * Maybe take a look at adding local page data as well
    * Really likes that on the current dashboard page he can copy and paste graphs into a presentation.
        * Would be cool if you could copy and paste each card too
* If the graphs were removed and there was only numerical content would that make you more or less interested in the page?
    * No opinion. 
* Valuable score: 4, there’s more pretty stuff on there but the Usage details page has a lot more opportunity and excitement for him. 

Closing



* My last question for you is my favorite. Imagine if you had a magic wand, and could wave it around and make this page absolutely perfect for you. What might you change?
    * More info on Usage Details to click into.
    * Try to match terminology that people are familiar with: what is activity count? What are signed-in verified sessions? OR just be sure to provide people definitions.
* Are there other people you work with who use VA.gov metrics or the Performance Dashboard who you think would like to share their insights with us?
    * Howard Green, Rob/n Smith, Howard Taylor- other BIOs?

Action Items



* Signed in users definition on current PD page: make sure Login.gov data is included


#### **Name:** Melissa Rebstock

**Date:** May 14, 2024

**Role/Title:**

Branch Chief on Digital Experience Team & Multi Channel Technology Division. They are the business sponsors for VA.gov. Works with OCTO a lot. Has a few legacy systems that they are working to get over on VA.gov: e-benefits, digits to digits, veteran identification card. They mostly work with OCTO but contract out work as well. They collaborate with DOD on a lot of things, mostly data integrations. Focused on Veteran Facing tools/systems or Third Party Tools which can include things like Accredited Representatives: claims agents, lawyers, cemeteries, caregivers, etc.  

Intro



* In your role have you used the Performance Dashboard? Can you share a little about that experience?
    * Yes, she uses it monthly. Responsible for pulling metrics for a variety of things on VA.gov. Some data she can pull from here, some she gets from other sources and people.
    * Melissa provides data and metrics to her leadership who interacts with the funding stakeholders- Office of Management Budget. 
    * She collects the data and the comms team puts together a monthly/quarterly report and shares that out. She never sends out the Performance Dashboard to other people.

Current State



* What would you say the purpose of this page is?
    * High level health system check of VA.gov
* Is there any content on this page that is unclear to you?
    * Is it actually the last full month? Or is it the last 30 days? Time frames are not clear.
    * There are VA modernized sites vs. legacy sites- is this data actually for all of VA.gov or are they just the modernized site metrics? (we’re assuming it’s just the modernized VA.gov sites)
* Things that she walked us through:
    * She’s always looking at the top three things:  signed in users, user satisfaction, successful transitions. She looks at month to month.
    * She does need to refer to the definitions often. 
    * She looks at user satisfaction for each service. She basically just wants to know if it’s up or down from the previous month.
    * She really likes the Tool data in each card. But she can’t reference them in her reports because she needs specific time frames for her needs and they are unclear - checking mid month is tricky.
* Other data sources she uses:
    * What she can’t get from the Performance Dashboard she gets from an emailed monthly report. VA.gov Monthly Metrics slide deck - is this the one Michelle puts together?
        * She will reference old emails to get more historical data - she sometimes has to make fiscal year comparisons so she goes back in time a lot.
        * Saves all of the emails otherwise she can’t get this data.
        * Sometimes the data doesn’t match and that requires some run around. They don’t get insight into WHY numbers might be different.
            * Ex: people changed how they measure customer satisfaction so that’s why there was a change in the numbers.
    * She uses a different dashboard to reference mobile data- they also have a monthly emailed report.
    * She often needs the exact numbers vs the rounded up numbers
* She uses her own spreadsheet to aggregate all of the data from different sources: 
    * Gender ID updates, name updates- she has to go to somebody and get that.
    * Appt Reminders via Vet Text
    * Claim Appeal Views- claim status
    * Burial Applications
    * Health Applications
    * Compensation Applications
    * Successful Transactions
    * User Satisfaction
    * Total Page View
    * Total unique visitors
        * She is looking at total visitors vs. signed in users
        * Right now she get that number from the monthly emailed report
    * She’s going to give us one of their quarterly reports and highlight what she cares about
    * She has another spreadsheet for all the mobile data she tracks
* Numbers don’t always match up. There’s a lot of discrepancies.
* Her team is selective on what they share because the more you share, the more questions you get
* They want to be able to see how new tools are performing. She usually goes and asks the OCTO team for those things because there aren’t reports setup.
* Valuable Score: 5

Future State



* Looking at this page, what would you say the purpose of this page is?
    * Sames as before, high level overview- not as detailed as the current performance dashboard
        * Wondering if people are going to think we’re hiding something because we’re not as forthcoming on the highlights page
* Take some time to explore the page and share your thoughts as you go.
    * Loves that there is a download PDF version because it gives her the option to keep things  historically and look back.
    * What’s the difference between Highlights and Usage Details? It’s not obvious upon first glance.
    * She’s not seeing any definitions which she liked about the original page
        * What does “activity” entail? It’s not clear.
        * What is captured in form submissions, successful downloads? 
        * People won’t know what HCA stands for
        * Needs to know the difference between Activity vs. Sessions. 
        * Record letter downloads. There are two and she would need to know which ones it is: Decision Claims vs Decision letters
        * Doesn’t know what total search events means
        * Unsure what Sign in verified: new vs existing
    * She likes the activity bar chart - she just wants to see specific numbers when she clicks on it. She needs numbers for each category.
    * What is the average time frame for average satisfaction rating: monthly, yearly, etc.
    * Likes the activities with 4-5 star rating card. Would like to know the specific rating.
    * Feels like the Highlights page is giving her less than the current dashboard.
    * Wants time frames on line graphs with x axis so she can pinpoint potential correlations
    * Usage Details
        * Likes that you can filters
        * Still needs to know what Activity Count means. 
        * This is more valuable to her than the Highlights Page
        * Wants to know how those Read Reviews are being pulled
        * This page is pretty clear to her
        * Really likes how the columns are broken out
        * A little confusing with two percentages next to each other- would need to remember to keep things straight: 40% sat score with 2% increase 
        * Wants to manipulate the table and do a date range
        * She would use this page right now because of the percent changes so she doesn’t have to do that herself
* Main takeaways: 
    * Visually, the new highlights page is better but honestly the current dashboard is easier to read. 
    * Line graphs don’t speak to her like the bar graph does.
    * She needs more detail than the average user so she knows that this might never meet all of her needs 
    * Really need to define everything: what categories mean, what timeframes we’re looking at, terminology, etc.
* If the graphs were removed and there was only numerical content would that make you more or less interested in the page?
    * She would prefer the blue graph lines went away. She would only reference the beginning and end number. Confused if those spikes are days or weeks? Too much context missing that it’s not valuable.
    * “Since last April” is confusing. She thought it was just last month.
    * Likes the big bar graph
* She totally missed the year/month filtering at the top. Skipped right over it.
* Valuable Score: 3 or 4 as it is right now
    * She’s just familiar with the current one as is so it works for her
    * She would have to do more digging on the highlights page
        * Dips and spikes in line graphs, no x axis labels
            * Could open of more questioning
        * Time frames would be super helpful to call out. 
    * Red and the green is most helpful to her: scores that a valuable score of 5. Some of the most helpful data.
    * She prefers the current dashboard but likes our colors in the % changes to know if things are up and down. Would like some of the new elements worked into the current dashboard.
    * From a public facing site, she doesn’t know if people should see all of the Usage Details section. Ex: if we have a tanked Sat score, are we going to show all of those negative reviews publicly?
    * Current Dashboard is easier to read. Consolidated.

Closing



* Are there other people you work with who use VA.gov metrics or the Performance Dashboard who you think would like to share their insights with us?
    * No one is coming to mind.  She doesn’t know anyone who goes to the Performance Dashboard besides herself. She can ask around.


#### **Name:** Chris Johnston

**Date:** June 12,2024

**Role/Title:**

Current Dashboard:



* How do you currently use it?
* Grabs the larger data point/s. Users and sat score seemed like the most frequent for him.
* Where does he usually get data from reports he submits?
* Right now he’s reporting a lot on # of log ins because they’re focused on sunsetting DS Logon and Myhealthyevet.
* Joan Nicket? Jonah Nicket? Compares PD data to their data.
* Does he ever share the dashboard?
* On occasion. But usually just sending numbers back and forth.
* Valuable Score: north of 3, not quite 4

Prototype:



* Text heavy upon first glance
    * Would we ever collapse the page description at all? Or remove it altogether? Trying to reconcile adding context and not being text heavy.
* He misses seeing the visuals upon first glance
* Didn’t see “display service type” toggle at first glance. Thought it was part of the legend so maybe move it?
    * Thinks it should be a checkbox
* Didn’t see the select drop down right away in the graph section
* He does like bar charts but he tends to like looking at **18 months of previous data**
* Concerned with yearly numbers: unique sessions within the month but will they ever add up to the total number since unique sessions across a whole year can be different?
    * If we CAN have unique users for the whole year, let’s do that. But if we can’t, let’s call that out somehow.
* Likes the idea of a download of the data
* **What are we counting as activities?** It is not clear to him. We should have a better way to specify this. Is it just the activities displayed in the bottom half? Or is it activities even if they aren’t represented there?
* **He would love to add a top level metric: Total Users** (Total User Visits for data limitations right now) 
* Loves the breakdown on the graphs
    * He wants to know what’s actually being counted in each category? Is it the tools bucketed in the bottom half or is there stuff being represented that isn’t in the breakdown? Should we add helper text for each breakdown type in the graph legend?
* Total Sign-in users visits breakdown:
    * **Would rather see a breakdown of credentials** vs verified/unverified
    * He wants to see how those soon-to-be deprecated logins will decline
* User satisfaction
    * Really interesting breakdown with 4 and 5 scores
    * He was at first confused how we were measuring user satisfaction but the breakdown totally clears that up for him. Does that mean we should have **helper text in the graphs too**?
* Signed-in user visits: Helper text doesn’t include the login.gov login. Do we add it? Is the current dashboard measuring that?
    * We should tell people what a visit is: a visit is a session. A user can have multiple visits/sessions. Visits do not equal unique signed-in users. He wants to make sure that is clear.
* Visits don’t matter to him at all. He wants to know about PEOPLE!
    * He isn’t getting unique users from anywhere so it’s not just our problem
* He is involved in a report that measures/counts successful authentications. We asked him if that’s a better metric than signed-in users visits and he didn’t think so. Both are fuzzy.
* Really pleased with the tool breakdown and is thinking about the integrity of showing Sat Scores- he’s leaning towards yes? \


Secondary Notetaker

About Chris:

* Joined VA late 2017
* Knew Jeff though USDS
* Took over the VA’s website and turned it into what it is today \


What does he want from the performance dashboard



* Data analytics and sharing the data
* Having consistent analytics across OCTO and VA.gov (currently we do them inconsistently)
* We want people to use the same data in the same way \


Feedback about slides



* He agreed with the outcome
* “This is a good mission statement it allows you to experiment with different thing”
* HOW CAN THIS BE A RELIABLE SOURCE OF TRUTH?
* “Comments on one not sure how you are using the term business unit here it could mean octo it could mean omb it could mean a lot of different things”

Feedback on the New design



* “Are we deduplicating the data”
* “Possibly say the 12 month average number”
* “What does the 52% mean is it a single month of data”
* “Activity is a vanity number and that is really exciting”
* “What are we counting here what is worth counting what is not worth counting? For activities?”
* It might be interesting to see “Users to web pages in general 18 19 million people visit a month”
* It would be interesting to visually see a “Funnel total visitors signed in visitors”
* “Breaking it down this way is super helpful”
* All users would be a different filter because the scale is 8x
* “[I] Would like something like this with definitions of what exactly is included in disabilities? Would that include any contact update that kind of thing”
* Right now he would like to see what credentials were used to sign in. He would like to see insight about when a user is counted for two different credentials
* Might still be helpful to see the slow decline of change if for signed in users we showed credentials used
* “OOOHHH I don’t need to ask what is user satisfaction” (when looking at the 4-5 rating)
* Possibly show the metric successful authentications
* Might need definitions everywhere
* “What is a visit?” - We might want to elaborate on our definitions
* This is exactly what I was thinking this is breaking it down by service type
* How many activities were there? What were those activities?
* This was up 2 percent can I see the 12 to 18 month view in the graph.

Observational insights



* (He missed the radio button)
* He likes the break down
* Chris did not like the the signed in users is not really users but visits/sessions
* He didn’t think the idot was clickable
* This does not say login.gov we need to put that in there


#### **Name:** Lauren Alexanderson

**Date:** June 14,2024

**Role/Title:** She’s the Chris equivalent over the health portfolio. 7 years at VA. Primarily Veteran facing products- patient portal, clinical support, etc.

Current Dashboard:



* She’s seen the dashboard through many of its versions- Not existent, not updated, etc.
* Sometimes she gets questions from business partners, Charles, etc. “This is showing up on the dashboard, is there a problem?”
* Sometimes she will grab a snapshot to tell a broader story. But usually just uses it as a simple reference to point people to. 
* Once a month she has her team do a performance review and they use their own analytics reporting to pull that information- could see a future where the performance dashboard plays a role in that.
    * They report on downtime, failures, errors, csat. She knows that csat is fuzzy. VHA business partners are very sensitive to csat ratings but she knows that most people leave reviews when there is something wrong.

Prototype: 



* She read the helper text. Understood that visits were not unique users. 
    * User Sat made sense. 
    * Confused about activities. She wants to know exactly what activities that is referencing.
* She could see people freaking out about the red compared to numbers. She might have follow up meetings with people to discuss why.
    * She knows that going up isn’t always good and going down isn’t always bad but not everyone understands that.
* What story is the page telling you?
* More people are coming or coming again to VA.gov
* They might be doing less stuff on the site (again, not necessarily a bad thing)
* Fairly satisfied with their experience
* Saw the graph breakdown and really likes that level of detail
    * Likes that you have the choice to see totals and breakdowns
    * Better contrast in colors
    * For sure would use signed in user visits breakdown
    * Helpful to see activities breakdown but more of a reference point for telling a broader story. Could be cool for their team to let their business partners know how health care compares to other parts VA.gov
        * She is interested in an alternative version where it shows activity type breakdown- form submitted, something downloaded, page checks. She thinks it would tell a better story of HOW veterans use VA.gov. Could give us a better idea of what types of activities are getting more traction and potentially relative to the veteran journey.
        * Lauren really wants to de-silo the VA. 
* She is interested in adding more tools to the Healthcare section. She might be reaching out via Slack: caregiver tools, prescription refills. She’s interested in things like how many people are viewing, printing, downloading a thing- conversion. 
* Responded well to having interest in a start activity and finish activity
* Overall confusing:
* Definition of activities. What actions does that include or not include?
* Would she use it more? What aspects?
* Yes
* Csat. that comes up with myhealhevet all the time
* She would use the signed in user visit breakdown
* Within the healthcare table she might include a snapshot of that table in monthly reporting

Summary of Next Steps:



* Rethink arrow colors so we aren’t deciding what is green = good and what is red = bad
* Change activities helper text and activities graph breakdown
* Pick colors for graph
* Text heavy. Think about cutting.
* Additional timeframes
* Activity Type vs Service Type in Completed Activities graph
* Interested in a start and complete/conversion funnel for service type table
* Adding transaction time, failed transactions, etc.
* A process for people to add their tool to the page
