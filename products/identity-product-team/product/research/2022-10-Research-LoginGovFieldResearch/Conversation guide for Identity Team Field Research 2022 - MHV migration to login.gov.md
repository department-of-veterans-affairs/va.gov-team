## Intro - 5 minutes
 
Thank you for making time to meet with us today! My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes. [Ask notetaker to give a brief introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)]. For most of the time we are together you and I will be talking and [NOTETAKER NAME] will be taking notes, but I’ll pause ever so often and he/she/they might jump in with a question or two. 
Today we're going to explore some options related to how you log in to access VA Services like MyHeatheVet.
 
Before we start, a few things I want to mention:
 
- **This entire session should take about 2 hours.** I want to be sure to respect your time, so you may see me check the time periodically and  I may occasionally need to move us along to the next section of our conversation.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing you or your ability. If something is confusing or difficult for you it means it will be for other people as well and we need to fix it. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veterans needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **Over the course of our session I’ll be asking you to imagine yourself in certain scenarios and may show you pictures to set the stage for those scenarios. I will also show you some mock-ups or prototypes** This is a simulation to allow us to understand how to improve certain processes. Some areas of the scenario or process may not be fully fleshed out. Since this is just a simulation, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or login.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record our conversation as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 
 
*Start recording.*
 
- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record our session as we talk today? 
 
## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 10 minutes
 
-To start I’d love to learn a little more about you. Can you tell me a little bit about yourself and how you interact with the VA?
-What VA services do you use most often?
-Do you use MHV? What do you use it for? 
-[For those who indicated they tried to set-up login.gov and failed] Have you ever tried to create a login.gov account? What prompted you to do that? What happened?

 
## SCENARIO 1: LOGIN.GOV SET-UP AND RE-PROOFING - 45 minutes
 Thank you for that information. Now I’d like to dive into sharing some concepts that we are exploring. As I mentioned before these are just ideas and we are eager for your honest feedback so we can learn what works, what needs improvement and what to scrap all together. 
##First Task: [Receive email] - 5 minutes
[Connect to veteran’s context as appropriate] So, I want you to imagine that you get an email from MHV that reminds you that you have an upcoming appointment and tells you that you can upgrade the security of your MHV account while you are there for your appointment. 
[Show user the prototype email]
What do you think about this?
Are you interested in upgrading your account? Why? Why not?
What questions or concerns do you have about this?
Do you like the idea of taking care of the upgrade while you are at your appointment? Why? Why not? Would you rather do it online? Would you rather do it at the VA at  separate time?
### Things to watch for:
- Does the participant have a negative reaction to any of the language?
- Does the participant perceive value in upgrading their account?
 
## Second Task: [CHECK IN FOR APPOINTMENT] - 5 minutes
 Now imagine that a week goes by and it is time for your appointment at the VA medical center. You arrive at the VA medical center and go to your doctor’s office to check-in. Nurse working at the desk takes your information and gets you checked in for your appointment. The nurse then says that he can see that you are eligible to upgrade your account for more secure access to MHV and says you have time to do that now while waiting for your doctor. The nurse asks, “would you like to go ahead and upgrade your account?”
-What do you think about this?
-Would you upgrade your account at that time? Would you rather do it after your appointment?
 
### Things to watch for:
- Does the participant have any concern about the nurse knowing their account can be upgraded and reminding them?
 
## Third Task: [IN-PERSON ACCOUNT SET-UP: INFO GATHERING] - 10 minutes
Imagine you decide to upgrade your account. The nurse leads you to another close by desk where you sit down with a VA employee who will help you upgrade your account. Let’s imagine that we are now sitting at that desk. I’ll act as the VA employee to walk through this process we are prototyping, but I’ll also step out of character to ask questions and learn about your experience as we go along. As part of this process the VA employee would ask you for personal information. We want to learn about this process but protect your privacy, so for any data feel free to respond with made up information or just say the type of information back. For instance, when I ask for you birthday, you can make up a date or just say back to me, “birth date” but please do think about what it would be like to really share that information and let me know any of the information is not information you have with you, or that you would have to look up.
First I need to gather some information from you [ask for data required for account set-up including username and for them to type in a password.]
- Was there any information I asked for that you would not be able to provide in the moment (if the participant already mentioned some information they don’t have, repeat it here)?
- Was there any information I asked for that you don’t have at all?
- Was there any information I asked for that you wouldn’t be comfortable answering?
- If the VA had kiosks available so you could enter your own information and ask an employee if you had questions would you prefer that to having me ask you for all of your information?  Why or why not?

### Things to watch for:
- Frustration about having to supply information again
- Discomfort about sharing information
 
 ## Fourth Task: [IN-PERSON ACCOUNT SET-UP: ID PROOFING] - 5 minutes
All the right, the next step for setting up your login.gov account is to verify your identity. May I see your driver's license or other state issued ID?
(Moderator to do action of ID proofing, including simulating any required wait time)
-Is there another form of ID you’d like to be able to use? Why?
### Things to watch for:

 ## Fifth Task: [IN-PERSON ACCOUNT SET-UP: MFA] - 10 minutes
Alright, the last step for creating your login.gov account is to set-up an additional security check in addition to entering your username and password. We call this Multi-factor Authentication. You can do this additional security check a number of different ways. You can have a code texted to you or emailed to you that would then type in after you enter your username and password, or you can download an app that will generate the code that you enter in, or you can use a security key or you can have the code mailed to you using the post office, so it involved a delay.
-Do you already use multi-factor authentication for anything else in your life? Maybe for accessing your bank info or email accounts? 
-(If yes) How does that work for you? What kind of MFA do you use? Is anyone else involved in helping you do that?
-Which option do you think you’d choose for login.gov? Why?
-If you had the option to opt out of using MFA by acknowledging that not using MFA makes your personal medical information including medical records and prescription shipment information more vulnerable, would you? Why/why not? 
-One option we are exploring is slow or by mail MFA. The way that would work would be when you need access to MHV you request a code and we mail it to you. In 3-5 days when the code arrives you can use it along with your username and password to login and message your doctor or refill your prescriptions.
What do you think about that option? 

### Things to watch for:

 ## Sixth Task: [IN-PERSON ACCOUNT SET-UP: LOGIN TO MHV WITH NEW CREDENTIALS & SET UP CAREGIVER OPTIONS] - 5 minutes
Congratulations, your login.gov account has been completed and you can now use it to log into MHV as well as for many other government websites. You just type your new username and password in here.
Show existing screen/flow for using login.gov to access MHV
Now that you are logged with your new credentials you have the option to set-up limited or full access to your account for anyone who you want. That person will be able to create their own account and with their own username and password and access as much of your information as you want them to have access to. And you can change or remove their access at any time.
Is that something you would like to do?
Who would you like to give access to? What kind of information would you like to give them access to? Why?
Anyone else?
Is there anyone you would share your username and password with? Why?
Would you consider giving that person full access but asking them to create their own account? Why/why note?
### Things to watch for:
-Is this feature useful to them. 
-What type of information would they share

 ## Seventh Task: [ONGOING USE: CAREGIVER OPTIONS] - 5 minutes
Thank you for all of this feedback. I just want to ask you about one other idea. Now imagine that you have been using your MHV account as usual for about six month. You get an email that reminds you that you set up caregiver access for the following people (mention anyone they mentioned in previous task) and what level of access you gave them. It asks you to review those listed and make sure they are still correct. If you want to make any changes it gives you a link to update. The email also asks you to think about anyone you might have shared your user name and password with. If any of those people should no longer have access to your account it suggests you change your password and provides a link to do that as well.
-What do you think about this email?
-Would it be useful to you? Why or why not?


##SCENARIO 2: ACCOUNT MIGRATION WITH DELAYED PROOFING - 45 minutes
##First Task: [Receive email] - 5 minutes
[Connect to veteran’s context as appropriate] So, I want you to imagine that you get an email from the VA saying that they have used your MHV profile to create a new more secure login.gov account for you. Right now it’s just a provisional account because you need to confirm your ID and verify your address. 
[Show participant the prototype email]
How do you feel about the VA creating a login.gov account for you?
What benefit does the login.gov account have for you?
What will happen next?
Anything else you want to share about this email?
Who else would you show this email to? Why?

### Things to watch for:
-Feelings about VA using their data to create this account
-Perception of value
-Perception of effort required from them

##Second Task: [Go through initial password and username confirmation] - 5 minutes
Imagine you decided you would take care of the initial steps in acquiring your Login.gov credentials, and click to launch the login.gov preliminary account. Now let’s look more closely at the first screen asking to create your username and password. 
[Show password/username screen for preliminary login.gov account]
- What is this screen showing you?
-Why do you need to do this?
-Any thoughts about this part of the process?

### Things to watch for:
-Does this seem confusing to the Veteran
-Does the Veteran understand why they are confirming/setting password and username?
-Does the Veteran distrust the site for any reason?



##Third Task: [MFA Set up] - 10 minutes
Alright, Thank you. Imagine you confirmed your username and password and continued to the next step for creating your preliminary login.gov account and asked to set-up an additional security check in each time you enter your username and password. We call this Multi-factor Authentication. 
At this point you get to choose how you would prefer to Multi-factor Authenticate, and there are a number of different ways. You can download one time use codes that would then type in after you enter your username and password, have can have a code texted to you or emailed to you that you can enter in, or you can download an app that will generate the code to enter, or you can use a security key or you can have the code mailed to you using the post office, so it involves a delay.
[Show MFA screen for preliminary login.gov account]
-Do you already use multi-factor authentication for anything else in your life? Maybe for accessing your bank info or email accounts? 
-(If yes) How does that work for you? What kind of MFA do you use? Is anyone else involved in helping you do that?
-Which option do you think you’d choose for login.gov? Why?
-If you had the option to pause the set-up of MFA on your own and do it in person at a VA facility with the help of someone else, would you prefer this option? why/why not?
-If you had the option to opt out of using MFA by acknowledging that not using MFA makes your personal medical information including medical records and prescription shipment information more vulnerable, would you? Why/why not? 
-One option we are exploring in particular is security keys. As you might know, security keys are are small devices like this (show security key) that can either be plugged into a computer or held close to a smart phone and act as the secondary confirmation so you don’t have to type anything in after your username and password. 
-What do you think about the security option? 
- If you Multi-factor Authenticate on your own with a less secure method (eg. download codes), would you want to upgrade to security keys when in person at a VA facility? why/ why not?
-Do you anticipate needing help setting up or using the security key? If so, what would be the ideal help and from who?
-Would you be concerned about losing the security key?
-If it was designed to clip onto your keyring or fit into your wallet (show illustrations) how would that affect your thoughts about it?

### Things to watch for:
-Does this seem secure to the Veteran
-Does this seem confusing to the Veteran

##Fourth Task: [Login.gov preliminary access screen] - 5 minutes
After that you continue to access your MHV site like always, although now you are using the new username/password that was created for login.gov and the multifactor authentication method you chose. You are still able to refill your prescriptions and communicate with your doctors. 

You can see on the side that there are still some things that need to be confirmed, but there is some time to accomplish them. You can do them now, fully online, or wait to do them in person at your next visit to a VA facility.  If you prefer the in person option, you can even set up a separate appointment. 

[Show MHV screen with verification progress]
- What is this screen showing you?
-Why do you need to do this?
- What are your thoughts about having time to finish verification in person later?
-Are any parts of this screen confusing to you?

### Things to watch for:
-Does this seem confusing to the Veteran
-Does the Veteran understand they have time to finish the Login.gov proofing process?
-Does the Veteran understand at this point the difference between Login.gov and MHV?

Let’s say that a few months later you have a doctor’s appointment at the VAMC. When you arrive and check-in, the person at the desk gets you all checked in and then says, “I see that we could confirm your ID today if you’d like for your login.gov account that you use to access MHV. Would you like to do that now?


##Fifth Task: [Check into appointment at VAMC and MSA encourages ID Proofing] - 5 minutes
A few months later you have a doctor’s appointment at the VAMC. You receive an email that reminds you that you will also complete address and ID verification for Login.gov, and to be sure to bring your ID.
When you arrive and check-in, the person at the desk gets you all checked in and then says, “I see that we could confirm your ID today if you’d like for your login.gov account that you use to access MHV. Would you like to do that now? 
- What about this option do you like or dislike?
- What are your thoughts on an email reminder to complete your ID verification and bring your ID with you at your next visit?
- Would you have preferred to set up the appointment to check your ID separately?

### Things to watch for:
-Does ID verifying at the next VA visit feel like a burden or a convenience to the Veteran? 


##Sixth Task:  [IN-PERSON ACCOUNT SET-UP: LOGIN TO MHV WITH NEW CREDENTIALS & SET UP CAREGIVER OPTIONS] - 5 minutes
Congratulations, your login.gov account has been verified it will continue to work for MHV and you can now use it to access many other government websites. 
To access MHV you just type your new username and password in here and then complete the MFA.
Show existing screen/flow for using login.gov to access MHV
Now that you are logged in,  I would also like to point out a new feature that gives you the option to set-up limited or full access to your account for anyone who you want. That person will be able to create their own account with their own username and password and access as much of your information as you want them to have access to. And you can change or remove their access at any time.
Is that something you would like to do?
Who would you like to give access to? What kind of information would you like to give them access to? Why?
Anyone else?
Is there anyone you would share your username and password with? Why?
Would you consider giving that person full access but asking them to create their own account? Why/why note?
### Things to watch for:
-Is this feature useful to them. 
-What type of information would they share

 ## Seventh Task: [ONGOING USE: CAREGIVER OPTIONS] - 5 minutes

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes
Thank you so much for walking through all of that with me.
- Of all of the things we reviewed, is there something that you think is especially important for us to make sure to implement?
- Of all of the things we reviewed, is there something that you really didn’t like and we should make sure not implement?
- If you were going to tell a fellow veteran about upgrading their MHV account to use login.gov for access, what would you say?
- Any other thoughts you want to share about what we reviewed together? 
- Any questions for me? 
 
## Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes
 
Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on Veterans options for accessing their benefits.  

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.
 
Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
 


## Emergency Exit
[Will be updated based on specifics of our physical location.]
[For an emergency with our team] Out of questions: We have covered all the questions I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback. [Note that any compensation from Perigean will still arrive as discussed.]
[For building-wide issue like fire alarm] Well, it looks like we need to cut our conversation short. Can we help you find the exit?
