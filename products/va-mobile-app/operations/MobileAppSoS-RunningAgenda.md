## Notes

6/13/23
* User Retention Research - Liz
    * We'd like to start this right away
    * Please surface any questions you may have 
    * Liz to post the Research plan for Rachel & Ryan to review
* Sprint Capacity Planning - Content capacity  
    * Misty has 10 planned points for Sprint 74 but capacity is only at 5
    * Affects Check In and Confirmation Message Audit epics
    * Have worked ahead a bit on audit epic and hoping to reduce points for work in this sprint, encompassing really only QA'ing content and helping answer questions that come up from implementation.
* In-App Recruitment Step 2 (Adam)
    * Thanks Ryan for confirming we can use the Perigean link; Danielle will be included in content approval- [Slack thread](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C018V2JCWRJ/p1686256275924369)
    * Dependency - We will need Kevin Hoffman / Danielle Thierry approval before implementing as they are not currently looking to increase their recruitment database size (see Slack thread for more details)
    * Proceeding with Step 2 focusing on UX design and business logic per Po's approval last demo
 * Secure Messaging - Realignment with Web (Adam)
    * Identified threading work needs to carry over 5654 ; Worked with Binny and will be picking this up 
 * Secure Messaging - Migrate to Re-Engineered Patient APIs (Adam) 
    * Meeting scheduled for Friday with MHV SM team including Mobile's Binny, Jayson and myself
    * Will have more of an update post meeting 
    * Open items: still awaiting ICD and updated schedule from MHV SM
 * EVSS Migration updates


5/31/23
* Preferred & Gender Identity Post release Bug identified
  * Authentication rule missed during implementation thatpreferred name and gender id updates are only available for idme and logingov user
  * Fix put in place by BE to update policy, but an issue was identifed on Friday by QA that when attempting to update Gender identity a service call was repeatadly being made and user hangs on a loading screen.  BE fix was needed as it was released in prod.  Next steps in handling this scenario for FE.  Do we show message to user upfront that they are not able to update, do we show messaging when user attempts the update, and what type of servicing error will come back from backend.   I have reached out to the accountexp-authexp team to see how they are handling message display in prod for web [DSVA thread](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C909ZG2BB/p1685471206085409).  
* Ticket Management - PO approval on closing tickets not yet worked that are 1 year or older (anything older than 6/1/2022) - Adam
    * A lot has changed in the last 1 year which means they are likely outdated and will need a new ticket created with updated details and information before they can get prioritized
    * Tickets that are closed are still reecords in the system that can be reviewed if needed 
    * Goal - establishing such a practice will help keep the board clean by having relevant tickets on the board 
    * Expect we will learn as we do this but feel this is a solid first step
* Sprint Capacity Planning - QA capacity  
    * QA Team is facing over capacity 
    * QA does not have enough capacity to validate all new work and catchup work 
    * Therese reviewed upcoming sprints and increased QA capacity to better align and identified projects with no QA capacity associated with them but anticipate they will 
    * Need to set up a QA sizing process 
    * Leads need to discuss further and decide how we want to handle
       * EVSS and SM have external deadlines 

* C&P Appointments - C&P appointments are displayed in the VAOS application.   As of late April, the appointments team made some updates to the upcoming/past appt list to display Compensation & Pension as the appt type vs. the service type (i.e. Audiology & speech).  Additionally, a recent change request was implemented to not allow for these appt types to be canceled via VAOS and the user has to call the facility to make a change
  * Request for mobile to implement the above changes; originally to ensure functionality to not allow cancel, however in review it looks as though mobile needs to make additional appt list view changes to reflect the display of the appts.  Next step: priorize work/timing
  * Appt team, ticket references: [56997](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/appointments-team-603fdef281af6500110a1691/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/56997)- Display C&P Appointments on the appt list(upcoming & past) and [57824](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/appointments-team-603fdef281af6500110a1691/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/57824)-Set cancellable false for Comp & pension appts
  * We need to determine priority of this work

* Check-in
  * Veterans will need to text a VA number and VA will text them back
  * Working on the content of the message
  * Meko to work with Laurie on Check-in team to ensure they are creating tickets for this work
  * Shawn also proposed sending Push Notifications
    * Meko & Rachel to discuss further
 
 * VBA had a data request last week
  * miscommunication on this request - in the future if anyone outside of our team asks for data, include Rachel & Ryan so they can help prioritize requests

5/23/23
* Sprint 72 Planning [Mobile Team Sprint Planning - Sprint 72.pdf](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/files/11554612/Mobile.Team.Sprint.Planning.-.Sprint.72.pdf)



5/16/23

Check-In
* Team is working on providing LOE estimate for 2 check-in user experience flows 'check-in w/pre-registration & check-in w/out pre-registration.  Target to have estimates by Wed 5/16. Being tracked [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app/issues/5670)
* Push Notifications - Most of this effort is coordination that will need to be done w/check in team, Vetext/VaNotify (no implementation work on mobile).  If this is required for MVP, engagement will be needed with VeText/VANotify, are they in line with MVP timelines etc.
* Deep Linking - Will require a team spike (research time) to explore what would be involved and needed to implempement deep linking on the app
* There was an ask by Kay to add 'my-health-APPOINTMENTS' label to our check in Epic so that it would appear on the Unified Appointments Experience board.  It doesn't look like we are on the same repository and do not have access to adding the label and linking.  Need PO support on how to go about linking.  [Unified Appointments Experience Board](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/unified-appointments-experience-includes-mhv-to-vagov-check-in-mobile-etc-63d9ef2effd69b002641127b/board)
  * Ryan to find out
* Call Center Hand-off - may be another team to do MVP
  * Ryan to follow up with Rachel about meeting on 24th
* Better monitoring of any API outages - SM went down and we weren't sure of the process
  * There is confusion around who is responsible for alerting of outages, especially on off-hours.  Platform has on-call rotations but our program doesn't have the same.  Previously we have been advised to not alert upstream teams to errors we see as they should already be aware, so we didn't alert of the SM outage. 
* Providing alerts on important events in a Veteran's life - [Event Bus](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/VES/blob/master/initiatives/Invest%20in%20an%20event%20driven%20architecture.md) ETA Jan 2024
* Moving Sprint Demo to current Sprint 0 time slot and vice versa.
  * Confirm over Slack, want to ensure we get Rachel's feedback.  Ryan is ok with that change.



---------------

5/9/23

Sprint Demo meeting  - is there a better time slot?

EVSS Migration - data discrpencies
  * New claims Status data source does not include the VA Representative (removed because it was misleading)
  * We have concerns about removing it from the Claims tool in the app because there is no where else that provides this information.  
  * We could use help understanding how VA.gov made the decision to remove it

-----------------


5/2/23

Preferred Name & Gender Go/Live  on hold
  * Team currently troubleshooting, lag in update identified in during UAT.  Requires multiple update attempts to populate Preferred Name & Gender Identity issue #[5548](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app/issues/5548) 

Secure Messaging - MHV Re-engineering SM PAtient APIs & Mobile having to migrate  
  * This is completely separate work than the Secure Messaging Alignment (copy, attachment, categories, etc) work 
  * Late March MHV notified Mobile that they are re-engineering APIs for Secure Messaging Patient APIs - no functionality changes just moving to a new platform 
  * This requires Mobile to migrate to these APIs on the new platform in order to keep Secure Messaging functioning (May 31st is when MHV targeted their work completed ; Needed Mobile to migrate by 8/22) 
  * Given this mobile is entirely dependent on MHV as it's their APIs that need to be completed 
  * Informed last week that this timing may be at risk - no timeline given - delays some Q2 planned capacity (BE mainly) till later into Q2 and likely early Q3 
  * Next step is to meet with them in June 
  * I made this a separate item above   

Digital Decision Letters
  * All set to go live 5/9
  * Notifying VBA stakeholders

Figma Shipped Files
  * Ryan curious the effort we put into Design Ops tasks
    * VA.gov doesn't do the same process
    * We are putting more effort in right now but it won't always be this effort-heavy, going forward designs will go from working files into Shipped files.  We just need to build them out to start right now.
    * Ryan curious if there is a way to use the Shipped Files in Figma with his Data Dictionary work he is doing

-----------------

4/25/23
Discussion Items 
* Experience and worked through resource constraints in Sprint 69 
  * Overcame this challenge through positive team work and communicaiton - great job team!! 
* What's New in-app UI - what threshold do we want to use for utilization of the What's New alert on the app Home screen?
  * We will put both DDL and PNGI into the What's New Alert for this release.
* Pulling in Check-In Discover into Sprint 70 
  * This work was not planned for Sprint 70 so pulling it in means we need to remove work to compensate for the infusion of capacity to perform this work 
  * Need POs to decide what gets pulled out, we would recommened Secure Messaging Alignment and Claims Step 2 work 
  * Also may need to pull out work from Sprint 71 and 72 to compensate 
  * Expected lift for Check-in in this Sprint is lower than originally thought.  Health team to reevaluate if anything needs to be pulled out.
* More info coming later about the effort to put up Smart Banners on VA.gov to help drive people to use the mobile app.


-----------------
4/18/23
* Resource constraints on FE team have caused concerns for both DDL and WCAG features being wrapped up this Sprint
  * Should be more cognizant of capacities in Sprint Planning
* RX - MHV team making a change tonight related to tracking prescriptions
  * Rachel & Ryan - we need help understanding if this requires changes for us.  If so, we need to discuss timing as we can't match their release (tonight)
  * Currently we get tracking info from CMOP - not sure if this change is adding to this or something different
  * New content disclosure needs to be displayed?
* RX Research concluded, findings and recommendations to come
