## Updating the content

The new upload app images to app stores process has been streamlined to make the process easier and complete and navigate.  If a new image is required, steps need to happen in this order:
1. Data is added to [screenshot_data.ts](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app/blob/develop/VAMobile/e2e/screenshots/screenshot_data.ts) as a block of code in the current file.  (Eplination of usage below)
2. If the screen does not have a function built to access it in [screenshot_utils.ts](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app/blob/develop/VAMobile/e2e/screenshots/screenshot_utils.ts), a function will need to be created for detox to locate the screen.
3. When a PR is created and it detects changes to [screenshot_data.ts](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app/blob/develop/VAMobile/e2e/screenshots/screenshot_data.ts), [screenshot_e2e.yml](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app/blob/develop/.github/workflows/screenshot_e2e.yml) will automatically run creating the screenshots.
4. Once they are created, framed and updated, they will be copied to the folders where they are to go for the App stores.
5. These will be committed to your PR so they me be reviewed.
6. Once approved and merged, These screenshot updated will be pushed to the store on the next release of the app.

## Updating App Store Images

Explanation of files:

### `VAMobile/e2e/screenshots`

```bash
#va-mobile-app/VAMobile/e2e

#### [screenshot_data.ts](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app/blob/develop/VAMobile/e2e/screenshots/screenshot_data.ts)

---

This file is the core of the update. The image names, devices and description is pulled from here to create the screenshots. When this file is modified and checked into a PR, A workflow will trigger, build the new images and add them to the PR.

#### [screenshot_utils.ts](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app/blob/develop/VAMobile/e2e/screenshots/screenshot_utils.ts)

---

This file holds the setup functions that detox will run when it gathers the screenshots. They are named by screen and are added in [screenshot_data.ts](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app/blob/develop/VAMobile/e2e/screenshots/screenshot_data.ts).

#### [screenshot_e2e.ts](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app/blob/develop/VAMobile/e2e/screenshots/screenshot.e2e.ts)

---

This file is what detox runs when it grabs the images from the simulators. This file calls in data from [screenshot_data.ts](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app/blob/develop/VAMobile/e2e/screenshots/screenshot_data.ts) to make grab the correct device type. It also calls in the functions from [screenshot_utils.ts](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app/blob/develop/VAMobile/e2e/screenshots/screenshot_utils.ts) to access the correct screens.

### [.github/workflows/screenshot_e2e.yml](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app/blob/develop/.github/workflows/screenshot_e2e.yml)

---

This is the new action that triggers when [screenshot_data.ts](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app/blob/develop/VAMobile/e2e/screenshots/screenshot_data.ts) is updated. This will

- Run detox on ios
- Run detox on ipad
- Run detos on android

After detox runs and gathers all the images [move_screenshots.sh](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app/blob/develop/.github/scripts/app-store-images/move_screenshots.sh) is run. This moves all the screenshots from there current folder `VAMobile/artifacts` to `.github/scripts/app-store-images/fastlane/screenshots/en-US`. Once they are moved [process_images.sh](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app/blob/develop/.github/scripts/app-store-images/process_images.sh) is run. This will:

- Resize all images to the proper screenshot size for the device.
- Use `Fastlane FrameIt` to frame all the images with the correct device frames.
- Apply the VA blue gradient to all images
- Apply the description text from [screenshot_data.ts](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app/blob/develop/VAMobile/e2e/screenshots/screenshot_data.ts) to the image in the VA chosen font.
- Resize the images to their final size
- Move the images from `.github/scripts/app-store-images/fastlane/screenshots/en-US` to `.github/scripts/app-store-images/framed-images`.

Each screenshot group is captured as an artifact in the pipeline in case it is needed for later use. The final framed images are also captrued as an artifact so they may be viewed. When the PR is merged, it will update the images in the image folders and once the app is released to the store, the images will be updated.

the proccess of getting the new images to the app store remains unchanged. when `upolad_app_store` is called from the the review lane, it will upload all screenshots in `ios/fastlane/screenshots/en-US` for ios and `android/fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/images/phoneScreenshots` for android screenshots.
