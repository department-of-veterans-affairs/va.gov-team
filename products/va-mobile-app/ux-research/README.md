# Background
The goal of our UX research is to validate or invalidate bets that were derived from our initial [discovery sprint](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/va-mobile-app/discovery-sprint). In order to do that, we have a set of activites that will allow us to experiment and test the bets. Each activity has a corresponding output that we will use to communicate our findings. 

## Guiding Question
These bets were made in response to questions that have guided our UX research: 
1. What features should a VA mobile app include?
*What features do Veterans prioritize and need in a VA mobile app?*
2. Why should VA build a mobile app?
*What problem for VA beneficiaries does a mobile app solve that VA.gov and existing apps don't solve?*

In other words, the bets are initial recommendations about features would be valuable to Veterans. The first bet speaks to the types of features that Veterans need and would use whereas the second bet speaks to the reason they would use them instead of what exists today. Using the activities and outputs listed below, we will either valiate or invalidate these bets, getting us one step closer to recommending a feature set for a VA mobile app.

## Bet: Authenticated features are more valuable to Veterans than unauthenticated features
To evaluate this bet, there are a series of exploration questions that we wil be trying to answer in our activites and output:

- Who are the Veterans that will be most likely to use a VA mobile app and why? 
- What non-VA apps (non-social media apps) do they use the most and why?
- How are Veterans managing their VA benefits and services (apps, web sites, phone, VSO, etc.)
- Has the recent global pandemic changed the types of services Veterans need from VA? If so, how has it changed?

## Bet: A mobile application provides more value to Veterans than a mobile VA.gov experience.
To evaluate this bet, there are a series of exploration questions that we wil be trying to answer in our activites and output:

- How do Veterans currently use their mobile devices?
- What apps have Veterans downloaded from VA App Store (mobile.va.gov | veteran.mobile.va.gov)?
- How do Veterans feel about these existing VA mobile apps and how it meets their needs?
- Will or can a mobile app fill some of the gaps in Veteranâ€™s digital experience on VA?
- What do they prefer to do on VA.gov vs. a mobile device?
- What barriers are there to app usage/download?
