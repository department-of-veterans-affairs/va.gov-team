## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Alex and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about managing your VA prescriptions using the VA Rx Refill mobile app.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take less than an hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **We are going to be talking about your experience with VA prescriptions** If you are uncomfortable sharing your screen with your medications on it we can talk through that part. Please don't feel any pressure to share any personal information you are not comfortable with us viewing.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - X minutes

Before we get into prescription refills, I'd like to ask a few questions about your experience with VA health care and other benefits.

*Background info about the participant should have been provided by Coordinator already, so use this time to ask any other questions that you feel will help with the session. This warm-up is not required*
- Could you tell me a bit about how you manage your prescriptions from VA?
- Are there any things that make this more difficult than you would like?

1. Sign in
2. Find out how many refills remain
3. Get your medication list to bring to an appointment
4. Contact your doctor about your medications
5. Do you have any refills that you need to order?


## First Task: Sign in to the app - 5-10 minutes

- Please open the Rx Refill app on your device
  - If already signed in: Does that always go so quickly? Do you ever have any difficulty with signing in?

## Bonus Task: Refill a prescription – 5–10 minutes

- Do you have any prescriptions that you need to order a refill for?
  - **If so**, would you mind letting us watch while you do that?
    - How do you keep track of when to do this?

### Things to look out for:

- Needing external reference
- Any points of friction or frustration


## Second Task: Find out how many refills you have left on for a medication - 5-10 minutes

- Please pick one of your medications and check to see how many refills you have left.
  - What would you do if the answer was zero?
  - How often do you do need to check on refill status?
    - How do you usually do that?

### Things to watch for:

- What kind of switching around between tools or modes do they need to do?


## Third Task: Get a list of your medications - 5–10 minutes

- Please show me how you would get a list of your medications if you needed it.
  - What kind of situations do you need to do this in?
  - What do you do next to use this list?
  - Do you have medications from outside the VA? How do you manage them all?

### Things to watch for:

- Things about the list that are confusing
  - Things missing from the list
  - Duplication
  - Hard to understand language or labels



## Fourth Task: Contact your doctor with a question about medications - 5–10 minutes

- If you had any questions or needed help about a medication, what would you do?
  - Are there any things the app could do to make this easier for you?
  - Anything **VA** could do to make this easier?


## Post-Task Interview - 5–10 minutes

1. What are the things that were difficult or annoying about the things we asked you to help us test today?
2. What are the things that work well or that we should be careful about changing?
3. Are there any things that you wish the app did that you have to do some other way?


99. Any questions for me?

## Thank-You and Closing – 3 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to improve tools like this one.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session?
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
