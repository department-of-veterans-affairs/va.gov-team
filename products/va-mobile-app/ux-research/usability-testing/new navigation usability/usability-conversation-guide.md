- [ ] Mute your Slack notifications.
- [ ] Send out the [observer instructions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Observer-guidelines.1622311177.html) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel)).
### Starting the session:
- [ ] In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute.
- [ ] In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked.
- [ ] Check your [screensharing setup] and share permissions for participants.
- [ ] Ensure participant has Zoom downloaded on their mobile device:
  * [Apple App Store Zoom app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id546505307)
  * [Google Play store link to the Zoom app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=us.zoom.videomeetings)
- [ ] When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*

## Introduction (5 minutes)
- Thanks so much for joining today! My name is Holly, and [notetaker name] is here taking notes—it's very nice to meet you. 
- Today we're going to talk about the VA mobile app. Our discussion will help the team understand how to improve the app for Veterans in the future.
- I have a couple other colleagues who would like to observe and take notes during our session today. Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I want to be sure before we get going. Are you okay with a couple additional observers during this session?

* *If participant does not consent, use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.*
* *If participant consents, admit observers.* 
  * Ask notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)
  * Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth

* Before we get started, there are a few things I'd like to mention:
  * **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
  * **There are no right or wrong answers**, and I won’t be offended by any opinions you express. We just want to hear your opinions, so that we can improve the mobile app and make it work better for everyone.
  * **There’s no expectation to provide any personal information.** Please feel free to share your thoughts and experiences at the level that’s comfortable for you.
  * **We’ll talk together in the beginning, and then we will move to a part where I’ll ask you to open a prototype on your mobile phone and share your phone screen with us.** The prototype is a simulation of how we think the mobile app will work in the future. Some areas of the prototype will be tappable, and some will not. When we get to this part, you can interact with it the same way you'd interact with any other app, and I'll direct us if we run into any areas that don't work. Since it's a simulation, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
  * **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop. Just let me know at any point if you’re uncomfortable continuing, and we will end.**
   * **Finally, is it ok if I record the audio of our session today?** Our team will use this as backup in case we need to refer to something you said. The recordings will be destroyed after. 
  * Does that all make sense, and sound okay to you? Any questions before we continue?
     * If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

*Start recording.*

  **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Section 1: Warm-Up Questions (5 minutes)
* Before we look at the app, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.
* What VA services do you use?
  * How do you typically access those services? Website, phone call, something else?
* Do you have the VA Health and Benefits mobile app?
  * *If yes:*
    * When did you first start using it?
    * How did you find out about it? DO you remember where you downloaded it?
    * What are the main reasons you use it?
    * How frequently do you go into the app? Daily? Weekly? Monthly?
    * What do you like best? What do you wish you could change?
  * *If no:* Move to next question
* Ok, thank you for that.
* *Check #feedback-backchannel before moving on.*

## Section 2: Prototype setup & screenshare (5 minutes)
* Now we’re going to move on to the prototype part of our conversation. During our session today, I am going to have you imagine a series of situations and I’d like you to use the app to work through them.
* First, I’d like to ask you to share your phone screen so I can help you install the app and we can look at it together. I can walk you through how to start the screen share.
  * *[Help participant share screen]*
     * [iOS: Zoom screen share](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/iphone-start-screen-share)
      * [Android: Zoom screen share](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/android-start-screen-share)
  * If successful: Great, I’m seeing your screen. Take some time now to mute your notifications and close out any apps or tabs that have sensitive information. Feel free to take your time, and let me know when you’re ready to share your screen. 
  * *If participant is unable to screenshare and/or get the prototype to work on their phone: Use prototype (and screen share) on desktop/laptop instead.*  
     * If not successful: No problem, I can have you try using Zoom to share your screen on your desktop computer.
     * If still not successful: No problem, I can have you verbally walk us through what you're seeing and clicking as you interact with the prototype.
* Now I’m going to help you get the app ready. I am going to send you a link to the app we will be using in the session in the Zoom chat. Please go ahead and tap on the link to open it on your phone. 
 * Prototype ([Android](https://figma.fun/O2AJVI/view)) ([iOS](https://figma.fun/O2AJVI/))
* Ok, just a couple more things to set it up.
  * *If iOS:*
    * Once you have the app open in your browser, in the top bar, where the website name (figma.com) is, tap on the two AAs on the far left side. It should open a menu. 
    * In that menu, tap “Hide Toolbar” to hide the top and bottom bars. I will help you turn it back on at the end of the session.
  * *If Android:*
    * Once you have the app open in your browser, you should see a link at the bottom of the screen that says “View in full-screen.” Tap on that link. I will help you get out of full-screen at the end of the session.



## Section 3: Usability tasks (30 min)

* I want you to imagine that your name is Kimberly Washington, and you are a United States Navy Veteran.
