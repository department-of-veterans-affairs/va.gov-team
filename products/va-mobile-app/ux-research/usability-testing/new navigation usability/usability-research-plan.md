# Research Plan for VA Mobile App Information Architecture & Navigation: Evaluative Research - Usability Study

This work falls within the third phase of a three-phase project Mobile IA & Navigation project that will contribute to the [Redesign of the VA Mobile app](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/features/design/redesign-initiative-brief.md). For a summary of the entire project, see [VA Mobile App Information Architecture & Navigation - High Level Summary](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-design/information-architecture-navigation/High%20Level%20Project%20Summary.md).


## Background

The VA Health and Benefits mobile app was designed to allow Veterans to more easily complete key tasks across VA Health and Benefits services. 
As the app grows in its feature set, the VA Mobile app team needs a better understanding of how Veterans would navigate benefits and health services within the mobile app. This research initiative will focus on helping us to ensure the structure and organization of the app makes sense and can accommodate the new features we have identified as of interest on our roadmap.

### Project Objectives & Goals 


#### OCTO-DE Objectives

The following are the [OCTO-DE objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme) that this research supports.


1. Veterans can manage their health services online
2. Logged-in users can easily track applications, claims, or appeals online.
3. Logged-in users can update their personal information easily and instantly
4. Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features
5. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of informatio


#### Veteran Journey

Since Veterans can download the VA Health and Benefits mobile app any time after establishing benefits with VA, this work impacts the Veteran journey from Starting Up and beyond.

### Previous User Research

* An [Open Card sort study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-research/information-architecture/open%20card%20sort/Card-Sort-Research-Plan.md) was conducted in October 2021. The cards in the open sort represented current app functionality + planned/proposed app functionality. Their selection was based on conversations with stakeholders.
* A [Closed card sort study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-research/information-architecture/closed%20card%20sort/closed-card-sort-research-report.md) was conducted in March 2022. 
  * **Key findings:**
    - **Overall, participants grouped the cards provided in similar ways**, and they included the same core groups of cards within the provided categories (Health, Benefits, Payments, Account, General VA Info).
    - **Participants overwhelmingly agreed on which categories to place the majority of cards**, with 20 out of 36 cards having very high agreement (33 had “high” agreement or greater). That said, more than half of participants (25) reported that they felt uncertain about where to place one or more cards.
    - **The new Payments category performed well** …the majority of participants sorted payment-related cards into the new Payments category.
    - **Previous use of the VA Mobile app seemed to affect the way participants sorted cards** (19 participants who reported that they were VA Health and Benefits mobile app users grouped the cards in similar ways, whereas participants who reported that they were not VA Mobile App users grouped the cards in a variety of different ways).


## Research Goals


### Information Architecture Research

Fulfills [issue #2552](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app/issues/2552)

The purpose of this work is to inform the information architecture, content and design of the VA Mobile app in order to deliver a solution that is usable, useful, and extensible. See [VA Mobile App: Information Architecture & Navigation - High Level Summary](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-design/information-architecture-navigation/High%20Level%20Project%20Summary.md) for a high level summary of the entire 3-phase process.

Our **goals** in this study are to:
* **Primary:** 
  * **Evaluate the usability of the proposed navigation pattern and information architecture** (based on the Closed Card Sort findings) using a series of tasks the participants will be asked to complete. The tasks will require the participant to explore each part of the proposed IA and navigation, and they represent a combination of features with the highest engagement as well as features that have moved locations. This includes:
    1. Check the status of your disability claim
    2. Check the date of your upcoming doctor appointment
    3. Check your disability rating
    4. Update your email address
    5. Check your most recent disability payment
  * Determine if any **significant navigational barriers exist for participants who are current users of the mobile app vs participants who are not users of the mobile app**.
* **Secondary**: 
  * Pilot conducting remote, evaluative research using Figma prototypes on participants’ mobile devices, and improve the instructions and process for that in preparation for future usability studies. 


### Outcome

This research will help us identify opportunities to improve the planned information architecture and navigation pattern for the app before we update them as part of the Mobile App Navigation redesign project.

### Research Questions

1. Are participants able to successfully navigate to key tasks in the app using the updated information architecture and navigation?
    1. Which tasks, if any, do participants struggle with finding and where do participants expect to find those tasks?
    2. Does previous use of the VA Health and Benefits mobile app affect how participants expect to navigate to key tasks or ability to successfully complete tasks? 
2. Are the new category labels (Payments, Benefits) clear & understandable to participants?
3. Does the increased depth of hierarchy (ex: Claims now being under Benefits) affect participants’ perception of ease of use?
4. What, if anything, would participants want to change about the proposed information architecture and navigation?
5. What, if anything, are people expressing positive reactions to? How are they reacting?


### Hypotheses 

1. Participants will be able to find the provided tasks using the proposed navigation pattern and information architecture.
    1. Participants who are current VA Health and Benefits mobile app users may first look for some tasks in Profile before discovering them in Payments and Benefits, but will be successful overall.
2. The new category labels (Payments, Benefits) will be clear & understandable to users.
3. The introduction of the Benefits category will not cause participants to feel that the app is slower/harder to use.



## Methods + Tools

### Usability Study (remote, moderated)

#### Method & Location
* We would like to conduct moderated, remote think-aloud user interviews with usability testing over Zoom using a prototype. 
* We will ask each participant to download Zoom onto their mobile device prior to the research session. 
* We will send participants a link to a limited functionality, low-fidelity mobile prototype and then ask them to open it on their mobile device and to share their screen with us while completing a series of tasks.

## Recruitment

### Recruitment approach

We will recruit Veteran participants using a lean maximum variation strategy. We'll leverage Perigean's recruiting services to identify and schedule participants.

### Recruitment Criteria

Recruit 16 Veterans for a minimum of 10 successfully completed sessions (of the successful sessions, 5 are current mobile users, 5 are not).

#### Primary criteria
* All participants must be Veterans.
* All participants must have experience with one or more of the following VA benefits or services: VA health care, disability, education benefits.
* At least 8 should be active monthly users of the VA Health and Benefits mobile app.
  * An active monthly user is defined as a Veteran who accesses the app more than 1 time per month in order to review information or do a task.)
  * Please do a phone follow-up to confirm the participant uses the VA Health and Benefits Mobile App. Once downloaded, the app looks like this: 
      * <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79866060/181546254-135661e0-7546-4060-bb13-a1426490f887.png" alt="VA mobile app icon" style="width:100px;"/>  
  * If the participant can describe what the app looks like on their phone screen (even if they don’t know the full name), that should provide enough information to validate if they have the app and schedule the participant for a research session.
* All participants must have an iOS mobile phone (not an iPad) with the Safari browser installed OR an Android mobile phone (not a tablet) & be willing to use it for the session.
* All participants must have the Zoom mobile app installed on their phone. They can download the iOS or Andorid apps on the [Zoom website](https://zoom.us/download).
* All participants must be willing to do an activity from their mobile phone that requires navigating a low-fidelity web prototype and sharing their screen via the Zoom app.
* No assistive technology users (low-fi prototype does not support assistive technology).

#### Secondary criteria
* 6 participants who identify as other than white 
* 2 participants who identify as other than straight/heterosexual and cisgender
* 8 participants age 55+
* 8 participants who identify as having a cognitive disability
* 4 participants who do not have a college degree
* 2 participants who identify as women
* [VA Recruitment Checker for Equality](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Coordination with Perigean

To assess potential participants' experiences with VA benefits or services, please use their answers to the Digital Service at VA User Research Participant Recruiting Screener Questionnaire question _Which VA benefits or services do you have any experience with?"_.
