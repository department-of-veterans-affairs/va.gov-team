# Discussion Guide for Mobile App MVP Testing R2

January 2021

## Introduction & Logistics (10 minutes)
Thank you for joining us today. My name is Bridget and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. The VA has built a mobile app. I am working with the VA to make the app easy to use so it will best meet the needs of Veterans like you. 

- Right now, we are working on building the app. We're still in the midst of working on the project, so what you'll see today is a prototype. There will be things that might not look right, are broken, or are not working yet, and one of our goals in speaking with you today is to understand what isn't working and what we need to improve.  
- Since our app is still in progress, it's not yet in the app store where you might typically download a mobile app. So to share the app with you today, I will send you a file here on Zoom, and ask you to manually install the app directly onto your phone. I don't expect that you have done this before, and I can walk you through each step together via screen share to get the app up and running.  

Do you have any questions so far?

- Once the app is up and running on your phone, I will ask you to sign in using your own DS Logon, My HealtheVet, or ID.me username and password. Set up of the app and sign will probaby take awhile, and I expect set up and sign in to take most of our time, and I appreciate your patience working through these things with me in advance. 
- If at any point we are hitting road blocks during the set up and sign in process, I have the app on my phone, and we can look at it from my phone together.

Does this all sound ok so far?


Before we start, there are a few things I want to mention:
- Our conversation should take a little under an hour.
- I will not be offended by any opinions you express - please be as honest as you feel comfortable being. My goal is to help VA build the most useful, usable mobile app we can, I want to hear any feedback you have.
- Since you will be signing into your own VA account some of your VA appointment, claims and appeal, and profile information will be shared. I understand that there may be certain things that you do not want to share with us. If there is something you would rather not share let me know and we can skip it.
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. This is a voluntary session, and you will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
- Lastly, I would like to record our conversation. We ask to record because it allows us to go back after our call and confirm that we have captured what you have said accurately. The recordings are not shared with anyone outside of this call, and we delete them a few weeks after the session. As I mentioned earlier, I will have you share your screen at various times and ask you to show us how you manage benefits online. This means that the information on your screen would be part of the recording. Do you have any questions about this? Are you ok if we record today?
  - If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
Those are all the logistics. Do you have any questions for me before we get started?


## Tech Set Up (10 minutes)
#### Step 1 - Device Check
First, I’d like to know how you joined the meeting today. What device are you using?
- If mobile: Go to step 2.
- If desktop or tablet: Do you have access to your mobile device, and can you join the Zoom meeting from there instead? 

#### Step 2 - Start screen share
Now I’m going to ask you to start sharing your screen with me via Zoom. When you are inside the Zoom app on your phone, you'll see a few buttons at the bottom of the screen. In the middle, there should be a big green button labeled Share Content. Do you see it? I'd like you to share your screen with me! I can walk you through what to do. If you see any additional prompts different than what I am describing, please read them aloud and I will help: 
Tap on the arrow that says "Share".
- A menu should come up with options of what to share - please hit "Screen".
- You should be prompted with an option to select what you'd like to share - please select "Zoom". You may see a message asking if you'd like to start recording or casting with Zoom. If you are comfortable with your screen being recorded, please hit "Start now". 
- Do you see a message asking if you would like to allow Zoom to display over other apps?
  - If yes, please select "Allow Zoom to display over other apps"
- The next thing you should see is a button for "Start Broadcast".
- Ok, tap anywhere on the screen to go back to the Zoom application.

Great, now I can see your phone screen! Thank you for your patience in figuring this out with me so we can look at the VA app together today. 

#### Step 3 - Set up prototype app on Android
Now we're going to install the VA mobile app on your phone. Does that sound ok to you? 

As I mentioned, this is an unofficial way to test a prototype of an app, so thank you in advance for your patience getting set up -- it takes a few steps. 

Alright, I just send you a link in the Zoom chat.
- To get to chat, please return to the Zoom app. In the lower right you should see a speech bubble with the word Participants and a red number 1. Tap on that to open the chat.
- Great. Tap on the "Download" button to download the file.
  - The file cannot be scanned for viruses, because it is too large. I can assure you it is safe to select "Download anyway" and proceed with downloading the file. Are you comfortable doing so?
- Once the file has downloaded to your phone (this might take a few minutes), open it and select Install. 
  - You may need to change your phone’s security settings to allow the app to successfully install. Turn on "Allow from this source" to allow installation. I would like to note that this is not something we would normally recommend you do. But because we're doing a guided walkthrough with you and will uninstall the app at the end you can trust this process and that it is necessary. If you don't want to change your settings for this app I understand and that is ok. Are you comfortable allowing this file to download?
- Now it's installed. You should see it where you access your phone's apps. It will be labeled VA Mobile with an Android icon.

Great. Thank you for bearing with me on getting everything up and running. Now we're really ready to begin!

## Warm Up (5 minutes)
Before we dive into the app, I’d love to want to learn more about you.
- What branch of the military did you serve in and when?
- How do you manage your VA benefits - for example, calling, websites, going into VA locations, etc?

Thank you for sharing that, I think we’re ready to get started. Can you navigate to the VA app?

## Sign in (15 minutes)
Next, I will ask you to process with signing into the VA mobile app using your own username and password. 
- When we get to the point where you need to enter your password, you can stop the screen share to protect your privacy if you'd like. Are you comfortable sharing your screen until we get to that point? 
- Signing in will take a couple steps, and I'd like to go through them slowly together -- I will ask you to stop and share your feedback at a couple points while you are signing in. Does that sound ok?

### 1. App home screen

### 4. Sign In 
Now that you are at the point to enter your password, please stop sharing your screen momentarily to protect your privacy - tapping the arrow button in the bottom left of your screen should bring up an option to stop sharing your screen. Please let me know when you have finished entering your password, and I can walk you through resharing your screen once again.

### Prompts
- [If the participant runs into a problem] What do you do when you run into a sign in issue like this?  

Thank you for your patience in navigating through sign in with me. Your feedback and input is so valuable to us as continue building the VA mobile app. 

I'd like to take a pause here -- before we go further into talking about what is in the app, do you have any further thoughts about signing in?


## Feature exploration (8-10 minutes)

- What questions do you have about what you see here?

### Free exploration
Now, you are in control -- I'm going to step back a bit and let you drive. Please take a couple of minutes to explore the app, going anywhere you'd like to go. As you do so, please talk out loud - I would love to hear your thoughts and questions as you explore the app.

## Wrap Up (5 minutes)
- Based on what you saw in our conversation today, would you describe this app as being useful to you?
  - If yes: what’s useful about it?
  - On a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being not useful to you at all, 5 being most useful to you, what would you rate this app?
- Can you give me a time in which this app would be useful -- where are you? What are you trying to do?

  - Can you pretend I’m a friend (or fellow Veteran) and you’re recommend the app to me? Why are you recommending it? What would you say? 
- Let's say the app I’ve shown you today hits the app stores tomorrow, with exactly what you see here, but you could add 1 more thing - what would you add?
  - Why?

## Remove prototype app (2 minutes)
Now I’m going to walk you through how to uninstall the app. Since this is a prototype it's only meant for testing and won't be updated. I would hate for you to try to use it in the future and have it not work correctly. So let's remove it and you can decide to install the finished app when we launch it in the Google Play store.
- Go to where your apps are and find VA Mobile icon.
- Hard press on icon and there will be the option to uninstall.
- Tap on uninstall.

## Close (2 minutes)
That’s all the questions I have for you today. Do you have any last questions for me?

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on VA’s mobile app and make sure it really works. Enjoy the rest of your day!
