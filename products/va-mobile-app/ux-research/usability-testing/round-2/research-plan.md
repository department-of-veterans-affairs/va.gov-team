# Research Plan for Mobile App Usability Testing

December 2020

## What product & team?
VA Mobile App

## Background
The VA Mobile App team has designed and built a MVP mobile app that can be used on iOS and Android devices. We would like to test this app with users to answer the following questions:

**Sign In**
- What usability obstacles exist with sign in?
  - Are participants able to successfuly sign in and return to the app?
  - If not, what barriers prevent them from doing so?
  
**Features**
- At a high level, what usability obstacles exist in navigating around Profile, Claims, and Appointments? 
- (If the participant has Profile data) What questions do users have about Profile?
  - What do participants find confusing/unclear?
  - Does anything feel like it's missing?
- (If the participant has appointments data) What questions do users have about Appointments?
  - What do participants find confusing/unclear?
  - Does anything feel like it's missing?
- (If the participant has claims & appeals data) What questions do users have about Claims or Appeals?
  - What do participants find confusing/unclear?
  - Does anything feel like it's missing?
  
**Usefulness**
- What do participants rate the app on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being not useful at all and 5 being extremely useful?
- If participants could add 1 thing to the app, what would it be? Why?

## Method 
#### What method of research are you planning?
- Remote, 60-minute user interviews with 10 Veterans. We’d like to recruit 10 people, and hope we are able to successfully complete at least 5 sessions.
- Each of these interviews will be moderated and conducted remotely via Zoom’s app on the Veteran’s mobile device.  
- We will be asking Veterans to sign into the app using their MHV, DS Logon, or ID.me credentials. Participants must be LOA3.

#### Why this method?
Conducting via Zoom is the only option at the moment. 

#### Where are you planning to do your research?
We will use the Perigean zoom account. 

#### What will you be testing?
- We will be testing a live code prototype of a mobile app.
- The mobile app will be unpublished at the time we test it, so participants will need to go through some set up to be able to access the prototype. How testers access the app will be different for each platform: 

#### Android
There is no prior set up needed. The moderator will walk participants through set up during sessions. Instructions that will be used for set up are [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-research/usability-testing/round-2/App%20Set%20Up%20Instructions_%20Android.pdf).

#### iPhone
Prior set up is needed. We would like to ask for Perigean’s help in getting participants who are iPhone users set up with the app prior to sessions. By doing some pre-session setup, we hope to be able to have enough time to conduct the app testing. Instructions that will be used for set up are [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-research/usability-testing/round-2/App%20Set%20Up%20Instructions_%20iOS.pdf).

## Participants and Recruitment

We would like to interview a minimum of 5 and maximum of 10 Veterans. Participant criteria: 
- All participants must be Veterans
- All participants must have an active DS Logon, My HealtheVet, or ID.me account
- All participants must be Level of Assurance (LOA) 3
- All participants must have signed into VA.gov within the last 6 months 
- All participants must have VA healthcare appointments
- All participants must have an active claim or appeal
- Assistive device users welcome, prototype app works with assistive technology
- Participant pool should be diverse in:
  - Branch of service
  - Gender (30% or more women)
  - Race
  - Age

## What is your recruitment strategy?
- Perigean will recruit
- Perigean will help with pre-session set up
- In order to get at least 5 successful sessions (participants show up and are able to successfully sign in and participate), we would like Perigean to schedule 10 participants total, with the expectation we will have at least a 50% success rate. 

## When?
1. Timeline for this study: Aiming for January 19-22
2. Length of Sessions: 1 hour
3. Pre-session setup is needed, instructions are [coming soon].
3. Availability: Monday-Friday (11 AM EST – 5 PM EST). Please don’t schedule back to back sessions. 
4. Prepare: We will conduct a pilot interview January 14th or 15th.
