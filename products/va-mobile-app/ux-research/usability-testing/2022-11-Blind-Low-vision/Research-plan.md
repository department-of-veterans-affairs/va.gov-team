# VA Mobile App Blind and Low Vision Research Plan

## October 2022


####  
Background


#### The Department of Veterans Affairs launched the flagship Health and Benefits mobile app in July 2021. The app leverages native mobile features such as biometrics, push notifications, and location and calendar integrations to make it faster and easier for Veterans to check the status of their services and complete simple, transactional interactions across health and benefits in a single app.

Since the VA strives for accessibility beyond compliance, we are testing with Veterans who are blind or have low vision to determine if they can navigate and complete tasks within the app without significant pain points. We have provided 2.1 and 2.2 WCAG guidelines during the development stage with over 88% pass scores. 

We planned to speak with blind and low vision Veterans prior to the initial app’s launch, but faced setbacks due to restrictions as a result of the pandemic. We are returning to this study as a way to gain awareness of the experience of blind and low vision Veterans who are currently using the app and who use accessibility tools that come with their mobile operating systems such as:



* Screen reader (Voiceover / Talkback),
* Dynamic Text (large text)


## OCTO Objectives

This research supports the following [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme) :



* Increase the quality and reliability of VA services
* Veterans can manage their health services online
* Logged-in users can easily track applications, claims, or appeals online
* Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features
* Veterans and their families trust the security accuracy and relevancy of the VA mobile app


## Veteran Journey

Our product fits into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) at all stages. 


## Research Goals



* Identify pain points as well as accessibility issues for blind and low vision Veterans who are assistive technology users (AT) as they navigate through the app.
* Establish foundational knowledge of patterns and differences in the experience across a diversity of mobile assistive technology users.
* Identify the value the mobile app provides to blind and low users versus other digital products in the VA ecosystem.


## Outcome

The findings from this research will help our team understand how accessible our current app experience is for blind and low vision Veterans. We’ll use these findings to plan future iterations to continuously improve the app's overall accessibility.


## Research Questions



1. Are participants able to successfully navigate to key tasks in the app using assistive technology (keyboard, voice, and zoom/magnifier)?
    1. Which tasks, if any, do participants struggle with finding and where do participants expect to find those tasks?
    2. Which tasks, if any, do participants struggle completing? Where do they get stuck? 
2. What, if anything, would participants want to change about the app?
3. What, if anything, are people expressing positive reactions to? How are they reacting?
4. Does the app have room for improvement with these tools and other tools that we may not consider during testing?  
5. How is the content language translating to the Veteran? 
6. Are there accessibility issues logging into the VA health and benefits app, and if so, how does the Veteran find a workaround? 


## Hypothesis


1. Participants will be able to complete tasks that are accessible at the surface level, but might run into usability hurdles with more complex tasks.


## Methodology

We will conduct remote, moderated, think-aloud user interviews with usability testing over Zoom. Participants will be asked to download the VA health and benefits mobile app in advance. During the session, we will have the participant share their screen and complete a series of tasks while they “think aloud.”


#### Location:

The research will be conducted remotely over Zoom, using Perigean’s account.

#### Study tasks

Participants will be asked to complete the series of tasks listed below.  This includes:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Task</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Location</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Review your military information
   </td>
   <td>Profile
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Review a past claim to find the details of what you’ve claimed 
   </td>
   <td>Claims
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Find your proof of service card
   </td>
   <td>Letter (end at review letter)
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Compose a message
   </td>
   <td>Secure Messaging
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


If people breeze through this, they can do a tour of other features in the app they’d like to explore.

Task completion will be scored on a 4 point scale, measuring the effectiveness of the proposed solution:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td colspan="2" ><strong>4 - directly successful</strong> (participant went directly to the correct place)
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td colspan="2" ><strong>3 - indirectly successful </strong>(participant did not go directly to correct place, but found their way there without help)
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td colspan="2" ><strong>2 - could complete with help</strong> (participant required moderator to give them a hint or return them to home screen)
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td colspan="2" ><strong>1 - unsuccessful </strong>(participant was stuck or incorrect, even with help)
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>



### Recruitment


#### Recruitment approach

Our recruitment will focus on people who use assistive technology ( Magnification and Screen readers)

**Identity Assurance Levels**

- **IAL1:** Attributes, if any, are self-asserted or should be treated as self-asserted; there is no proofing process. (***Ex., User generated user name and pw***)

- **IAL2:** Either remote or in-person identity proofing is required using, at a minimum, the procedures given in NIST SP 800-63A. (***Ex., Id.me or Login.gov account***)

- **IAL3:** In-person or supervised-remote identity proofing is required. Identifying attributes must be verified through examination of physical documentation as described in NIST SP 800-63A.
