# Research Plan for VA Flagship Mobile App Rx (in production) Usability Study 


# March 2023


## 
**Background**

The VA health and benefits mobile app team launched the Rx feature in February 2023. The purpose of this research is to engage with Veterans who are using the Rx feature in the health and benefits mobile app in order to surface any usability issues or points of confusion along the way in relation to prescription statuses and dates, and to understand their current experience refilling a prescription.


### 
**OCTO Objectives**

This research supports the following OCTO objectives:

Increase 



1. Increase the use of digital, self-service tools
2. Increase the completion rate of online transactions
3. Decrease call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution

### 
**Veteran Journey**


The research covers a broad spectrum of VA services, and applies at any stage from Starting Up through Aging.


## 
**Research Goals**



1. Evaluate how Veterans interpret the meaning of prescription dates and statuses on the mobile app, and how they use them in order to manage and refill their prescriptions.
2. Observe Veterans refilling a prescription on the mobile app in order to surface any usability or content issues. 

### 
**Outcome**


The VA mobile app team will use the findings from this research to help the team understand how Veterans interpret prescription dates and prescription statuses in the Rx feature on the mobile app. We want to understand how Veterans use this information to complete tasks in the app, and what they do or do not understand about them. Additionally, the team will get a baseline understanding of the current experience Veterans have refilling a prescription on the flagship mobile app. 

 \
The findings from this research can be utilized by other teams who are displaying prescription dates and statuses within other VA digital tools.

**Research questions**



1. Are the prescription dates and statuses clear & understandable to Veterans?
2. How do Veterans describe the meaning of the prescription dates and statuses they see when they’re managing or refilling a prescription? 
3. How do Veterans use the different prescription dates and statuses in order to find and refill a prescription on the app?
4. Are there specific usability issues Veterans confront when refilling a prescription?

### 
**Hypothesis**


Veterans will struggle to refill a prescription using the mobile app if they cannot easily understand the status of a prescription to determine if it is refillable.

Veterans will struggle to refill a prescription using the mobile app if they cannot easily interpret the dates associated with a prescription and cannot identify what action they need to take to refill the prescription. \
 \
Veterans will struggle to refill a prescription if too much information is displayed to them that does not help them do this task.


## 
**Methodology**

We will hold 1:1 interviews with Veterans and observe them as they use the VA health and benefits mobile app to go through the prescription refill process on their mobile phone or tablet. We’ll ask them to talk out loud as they go.


### 
**Location**

These sessions will be remote via zoom.

**Recruitment approach**


The audience for our research will be Veterans.


We’ll use Perigean to recruit participants and take notes.


**Recruitment criteria**

**Please recruit 12 participants for a total of 8 completed sessions.**

**All participants**



* Must be current users of the VA health and benefits mobile app 
* Must join the session on their smartphone or tablet
* Must have zoom downloaded to their device prior to the session
* Must be willing to log into the VA health and benefits app ahead of the session and share their screen over zoom during the session (please include device info in the tracker information)
* Should have prescriptions they manage through the VA
* Are using the prescription feature in our app (or are about to do it) and who need to refill one of their prescriptions through the VA using the VA mobile app 
* Should be comfortable actively refilling one of their VA prescriptions on the app over the session as we observe them going through the process

#### 
**Some participants**

* Recruit 2-3 Veterans who are age 55 or older
* Recruit 2-3 Veterans who are blind or low vision
* Recruit 1-2 Veterans who manage a VA medication(s) listed as a controlled substance 


**Screener questions 
 
We’d like Perigean to call participants ahead of time to ensure the participant has the VA Health and Benefits app, and to check to make sure they’re comfortable actively refilling a prescription as we observe them during the session.  \
 
Questions:

1. Do you currently use the VA Health and Benefits mobile app on your smartphone or tablet, and are you able to successfully login?


Response options: yes or no



2. Do you currently use the VA to refill any of your prescription medications?


Response options: yes or no 



3. Do you currently use the VA mobile app to manage or refill any of your VA medications? 


Response options: yes or no 



4. Are you willing to join this research session and have us observe as you refill one of your VA prescription medications using the VA mobile app?

Response options: yes or no

(In order to qualify for the study, the participant should answer yes to all 4 of the above questions.)

Additional questions for blind or low vision Veterans:

5. We want to make sure our mobile app works for people with various levels of experience with screen readers. Please rate your experience level using a screen reader:

6. Are you willing to join the Zoom session using this assistive technology? (Answer should be yes to satisfy criteria for screen reader)


Response options: yes or no
