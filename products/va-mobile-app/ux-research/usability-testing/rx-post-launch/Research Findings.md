## Rx Post Launch Research Findings

### Research Goals
* Evaluate how Veterans interpret the meaning of prescription dates and statuses on the mobile app, and how they use them in order to manage and refill their prescriptions.
* Observe Veterans refilling a prescription on the mobile app in order to surface any usability or content issues.



### Research Questions
* Are the prescription dates and statuses clear & understandable to Veterans?
* How do Veterans describe the meaning of the prescription dates and statuses they see when they’re managing or refilling a prescription?
* How do Veterans use the different prescription dates and statuses in order to find and refill a prescription on the app?
* Are there specific usability issues Veterans confront when refilling a prescription?



### Methodology
[ Placeholder ]



### Hypotheses and Conclusions
1. Veterans will struggle to refill a prescription using the mobile app if they cannot easily understand the status of a prescription to determine if it is refillable.
2. Veterans will struggle to refill a prescription using the mobile app if they cannot easily interpret the dates associated with a prescription and cannot identify what action they need to take to refill the prescription.
3. Veterans will struggle to refill a prescription if too much information is displayed to them that does not help them do this task.



### Key Findings
1. Participants recognized and understood their prescriptions based on the names and dosage. Most participants used this information as the main cue for which medications were available to refill.
2. All participants, except for one, scrolled the list to locate a specific medication. They only used filter and sort functionality once the moderator pointed it out.
3. Some participants noticed they could only tap the [Get prescription details] link. One participant mentioned this being a difficult way to get to the detail screen, and even referenced other areas in the app where the whole row is tappable. 
4. Participants did not understand the statuses when looking at them on both the list and the Filter options. Some commented that there were statuses that either they have never seen, or simply did not apply to their situation.
5. Participants did not use the interface to look up status definitions, even with the information icon present on the statuses.


#### Collaborating data from app users
From February 1 (the first full day of all user access to Rx refills) to March 31:
1. Over 494K users who were authorized for pharmacy had sessions in the app.
2. 11% (55k) of those users navigated to the PrescriptionDetails screen.
3. 7% (34K) of those users navigated to to the Refill screen.

Of users who navigated to the Refill screen: 
1. 7.4% of those users clicked on the sort function, and 5% made a sort selection.
2. 12.1% of users clicked the filter function, and 10.5% made a filter selection.

Those who used sorting used the the following sort types in order from most frequnetly to least freqntly used (each user only being counted once per sort type they used during the overall time period):
* Prescription Name: 55.0% of sorting users (1.8k)
* Refill Date: 37.6% of sorting users (1.2k)
* Refill Remaining: 19.4% of sorting users (<650)
* Facility Name: 3.9% of sorting users (<130)

The top three most frequently used filters were (each user only being counted once per sort type they used during the overall time period):
* Active: 88.3% of filter users (6.0k)
* Refill in process: 17.0% of filter users (1.1k)
* Submitted: 11.2% of filter users (<780)

Filters used less than 10% of the time:
* Active: Parked
* Discontinued
* Expired
* Hold
* Non-verified
* Active: Suspended
* Transferred
* Unknown

### Details of Findings

**Finding 1**

Labels: 

1. Participants recognized and understood their prescriptions based on the names and dosage. Most participants used this information as the main cue for which medications were available to refill.
    
    1a. When prompted why else they knew they could refill it, they referred to a conversation they had with a provider through secure messaging, or seeing the Active label tag that’s displayed on each prescription.


**Finding 2**

Labels:

2. All participants, except for one, scrolled the list to locate a specific medication. They only used filter and sort functionality once the moderator pointed it out.
    
    2a. After they completed the refill request, we discussed their desired interaction. All participants preferred to only see Active prescriptions. One noted they would use “the website” [MyHealtheVet] to gather more details, if needed. Nobody expressed the need for those details. Rather, some tried to imagine scenarios where seeing all of the data would be useful–all were hypothetical.


**Finding 3**

Labels:

3. Some participants noticed they could not tap the entire card to go to the detail screen, only the [Get prescription details] link. One participant mentioned that this made it difficult to go to the detail screen, and referenced other areas in the app where the whole row is tappable. 


**Finding 4**

Labels:

4. Participants did not understand the statuses when looking at them on both the list and the Filter options. Some commented that there were statuses that either they have never seen, or simply did not apply to their situation.
    
    4a. The moderator asked participants to describe each status on the list. Some participants attempted to describe all of them, while others only spoke to the ones they had experienced. In most cases, the way participants interpreted the definitions did not match with what VA pharmacy intends to communicate.


**Finding 5**

Labels:

5. Participants did not use the interface to look up status definitions, even with the information icon present on the statuses.
    
    5a. When asked how they would determine the meaning of a definition they did not know about, most participants said they would contact their provider. The method varied between secure messaging or calling the pharmacy.
