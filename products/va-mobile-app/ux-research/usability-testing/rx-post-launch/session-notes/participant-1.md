# Participant 1

## Warm up
- When did you download the app? 
    - About 6 months ago. I don’t know how to use it most of the time. I have my son to try to get into in.
- What was the motivation? 
    - I was told you could manage the appointments. A mobile app that you can see on my HealtheVet, everything is tailored to you and the information: Okay, yeah, I have been going to the prescription under my HealtheVet.
- Normally refill it that way? 
    - yeah, I have my son do it.
- Haven’t used it much or at all? 
    - No.
- How frequently do you use it (daily, weekly, monthly)?
- What do you use it for? (answered in conversation)

## General (Rx at VA)
- How do you manage meds today? 
    - If I go on there it will tell me which ones are due to be refilled and when they are refillable.
- Do you like it that way: 
    - I didn’t know there was any other way.

_Moderator walks Participant through login process for VA Health & Benefits_

- It is the blue box with white letters VA that says VA health and benefits. Than it has the sign in options, which one should I use?
    - Moderator: Which do you use normally? (id.me)

Did you download the app: I did let me go look for it.

• First time doing it in the app? Yes
• If no, tell me about the other time? n/a

## Refill Process
_Research moderator will mostly be in observation mode for this portion of the study. The moderator will invite the participant to speak aloud as they refill a prescription in the app. If the participant does not have an Active prescription to work with, they will walk through their recent experience refilling a prescription in the app_

- Go ahead and go into healthcare and enter prescriptions. Are there any you need to refilled today: 
    - yeah, let me find it.

- Looking for one you know of: 
    - Yeah. I see how they be changing these. A lot of them are outdated and whatever. The fill date, does that mean they filled in on that date?

- Is that what you think? 
    - yeah but that would have been March 21st and I don’t have it. No because I am looking that the fill date is 4/22 meaning that’s when it needs to be filled. That’s the way I will take it. It has fill date as 4/22 and that hasn’t gotten here yet. Let me click on this on that sat 3/21. Okay at the top is ahs request a refill so I would click that. Okay.
- Thoughts? 
    - I think that was simple. I mean its not hard to navigate now that I know what the refill date means. That tells me it can be refilled as of that date, not that it was filled on that date.
- From that date on it can be refilled? 
    - correct.
- Have you filled others recently? 
    - I have than I had a pharmacy that does a video interview and she added new prescriptions and refilled some.
- Do you see those there that she added? 
    - yeah. Let me see. This one here for 30MG. 
- That’s the one that she refilled on the call?
    - yes.
It says discontinued: she changed the dose, she changed it to 60 instead of 30. I know she refilled the one that she added on the call.
She changed it to 60 and that’s here and the one not refillable is still there as discontinued. 
- Do you keep track of that? 
    - No, I don’t have to because it says discontinued. I wouldn’t click on something that is discontinued and 60 has refill in progress and that tells me it’s the valid one.

- Scroll up a little bit: 
    - like this one is active and the filled date is 3/21 and it can be refilled. It’s a vitamin D. The VA pushes pills all the time when they write a prescription it in only for a length of time then they will write a new one for the same thing. If she wrote this one for 4 months, at the end it will expire.

- How many prescriptions? 
    - I would have to look at the list.
- It says 45: 
    - I don’t take 45. If it says 45 it may not have the discounted accounted for. I have one here that is discounted that isn’t labeled as it. It seems like they aren’t updating this. If you say you see 47, I am not taking 47 prescriptions. I am not even taking 10. All that if I am no longer taking it, it should be deleted off the screen.

- Thoughts? 
    - It needs to be removed. This is for the patient to refill the prescription. Its already hard enough. If I need a printout, I can get that from the hospital. This that is discontinued shouldn’t be here. I never thought of it that way I would just scroll and click the one I needed. I never really looked at it like this until you brought it to my attention

- Notice any filters? 
    - No.

- Explore the tabs: 
    - Okay. Pending medications are ones that I have refilled. Sort by medication name. This is an easy way to get what you want if you put the filters in, you can see what is up for renewal. Let’s see tracking. Refills with tracking information. Okay so this is everything that has been refilled. Get prescription details, 10 refills left, ordered on, expires on, it tells you when it was prescribed, when it expires.

- How do you use that information if at all? 
    - Well I don’t. if it was a situation where one was about to expire I would know and I could call the provider to submit a new prescription but it tells you when you do that last refill anyways.

- Phone Number at the bottom, is that the number you use or do you use a different one? 
    - Yeah that looks like my medical facility for my medical center. Although the instructions are already there I glance at the. I leave my pill container on the counter even though I place the pills in a sorter.

- Easier for you: yes.

- Any status you did not know, how would you get that information? 
    - what do you mean if I didn’t know what it mean. Like active, discontinued, expired.
- Like if you were new to MHV? 
    - I would call the pharmacy.

- Expect the app to help you learn? 
    - Yes. Here it says what it is but clicking on that lets you know what it is. Pretty much. I am computer savvy with it at that point.

- Nice to see ones that need action or currently taking. What about the Tracking tab? 
    - that tells me what is on the way so that’s nice
Situation when it is late: No, I have always gotten it on time. I may need to go to the post office because it is a big box, but it has always come on time.

- Any other areas here? 
    - I am going to ask my provider this. We have a pharmacy consultation. It is the normal of patience that it is always through primary care but when you talk to the pharmacist, I kind of understand that to. How they get the authority to determine how to change like form the 30 to 60. That wasn’t my doctor that was the pharmacist. I guess she has the clinic say so to change it, but I always thought that it was primary care. I put it in my book to ask my primary. I have a once-a-month interview with primary care so I will ask if they are communicating. I just want to be clear and on the same page so that is my hand up on that. That’s what gets me you have to be careful how you deal with the patience when you don’t have a clear understand what they are taking. I have to do a lot of homework for myself. She prescribed me today and I am looking at the causing and symptoms. I just do my own research you know. I think they are helpful but it is more than these outside doctors do. I cannot say I have had many complaints. I haven’t had issues with missing medications or anything like that.

- First time in here for prescriptions, overall thoughts?
    - You know I understand it, it is easy to navigate so I will more likely be using this rather than my HealtheVet. I was only ever told to sign up for my HealtheVet. It was just one of the nurses at the desk because they have a computer where you can sign up to it. I know I have everything here so I will delete the my HealtheVet app. This has everything (reading page)

- Anything you would change that you saw? 
    - I like that it shows all of the prescriptions that you are taking. The only thing that would be changed is that if they are expired, they shouldn’t even show. Moving on to pending, I think that’s fine. That will tell you if it is still active. If they could implement an alert for when needs to be refilled. My son does it and he separates the pills. I can just think of the alerts to be added.

- Pending is where refills? 
    - That’s when it would be on the list then under pending is when I clicked refilled. Here is where it tells you when it needs to be refilled. I just think it would be nice if there were an alert to let you know. Other than that, everything is in there.

- Tap filter by, thoughts? 
    - Well it means exactly what I just explained to you. We just have to go through it. You can get everything if you go to filter. If it is active, I would just click active and then it would only show active. If its in process than it will only show that.

- Those the ones that you would use or just using it as an example? 
    - I would look for active and the submitted ones to make sure I submitted the ones that I needed.
Let’s try one of those: It will show me the one that is in the process.

- Expected? 
    - Yes. Even this is good. Remember when we saw expired or discontinued. Maybe if they weren’t in the screen but go to filter to select it to appear. If you want to search the history than you can select it to show.

- Where would it show? 
    - Well it is basically not on the initial screen. It should come up as an archived item. If you go through filter than you will get what you want. Not everyone will be able to navigate through this. If you want them to navigate there should be an easier way. I understand it now but when I went on the first screen, I shouldn’t have been looking at someone expired that long ago. A month ago, I can look at that but if it was expired in 2021 unless I search for it.

- Did not go to Filters? 
    - that is correct. I didn’t do it until you told me to. It is easier to go to filter and it will than only give you what you asked for.

- Is that extra? 
    - it can be. You have to look at it from the point of view of a person that is computer savvy. If you really know your way around a computer and social media than filter will be the first item prompted in your mind but if you are not than you will just scroll through it until you see what you are looking for. Filter may have came first with you but not to me. I know what it means but there are some that don’t know what it means. I didn’t think about it until you brought it to my attention.

- Expect to happen after requesting a refill? 
    - well normally what happens is unless I go back into the app to do tracking. They will send a message via my phone or email that lets me know it is on the way.

- Does that work well? 
    - yes.

## Closing

Would you change anything about the Prescriptions feature: Not really.

Wave magic wand on the app, what would you change? Not really because I know how to navigate, and I am not thinking for someone else. My level isn’t high as computers, but I know to navigate my way though the system. I was speaking on behalf of maybe someone that doesn’t know to download the app to do what they need to do. I can say if they keep in mind filter they can do it. Look for filter, please go to filter than they find it out. I think it is a good system I really do. It would go a long ways if there course be introduction courses on how to use these apps. You mention it and at some point they become frustrated and that’s it. If you can get them into a class for 30 minutes to an hour and show them on a PowerPoint. I tell them then they want me to download it and show them through it and I just don’t have time for all that. I am not trying to be mean but I just don’t have all that time.

What would you tell veterans: to download this app. They just call me but I will tell them to download the app to see it than I would have to take them through it. I try not to get into all that, but I will tell them about the app.
