## Warm-up

### How did you learn what we were going to talk about?
* I think it was in the email I got. When they asked the questions. It was from the email but then it had specific things.
 							

### Were the instructions easy to understand?
* Yes, it was very good.
 							

### How long have you had the VA Health and Benefits app? 
* I don’t even remember when I downloaded it. It has been a while. I am not even sure. It just seems like I have always had it since it has been so long.
* I think it was 2020 in the summertime when it was launches so about three years, has it been that long? Yeah, it has been a long time.

### What was the motivation? 
* I think they sent out an email and it was a way to get refills on medicine and chat with our care providers and stuff. It is also to get our lab work and stuff. 

### Nice. Sounds like you saw the email and thought it was a good idea?
* Yes

### How frequently do you use it (daily, weekly, monthly)? 
* I just…it just depends if I had labs or need to refill medication. At least once a year.

### What do you use it for? 
* I used this app.					

## General (Rx at VA)

### How do you manage meds today? 
* To be honest, when my bottles get on the low side. That’s the only way. Sometimes they will send me 3 months’ worth so in that time span before the 3 months I have to refill.

### Works well?
* Yes.

### Manage any non-VA meds? 
* Well, Um. There are medications that I have that I don’t think comes from the VA because its not on the app, but I have to send a message to the doctor. I think they get it elsewhere and then send it to them.

### Do you have any controlled substances?
* No

### Anything that you have to have but don’t get from VA?
* Yeah, they get it from the outside then send it to me.

### How did you fill a prescription the last time? 
* In app

### Is this your first time refilling your medication in the app? 
* No, I have been doing that for awhile now to refill everything. Sometimes the therapist will ask if I need a refill and sometimes they will refill it too.

### What does the app look like, is it blue on blue (thinking of Rx Refill)? 
* Yes.

### Do you ever use a laptop? 
* No, I just use the apps. 							

### Why?
* I think the app is more convenient than having to go into my work room to use the computer. I have either my phone or iPad all the time, so it is just convenient

### Does anyone help you manage medication?
* No beside the doctors no.

## Refill Process

_Research moderator will mostly be in observation mode for this portion of the study. The moderator will invite the participant to speak aloud as they refill a prescription in the app. If the participant does not have an Active prescription to work with, they will walk through their recent experience refilling a prescription in the app._


### Is this the app you were talking about before?
* Yes, I was talking about this app.

### Is there another app you may have that does this? 
* No.

### Do you have the VA health and benefits app?
* I thought that this was it.

### Do you have a prescription that you need to refill? 
* I think I have them all. Yeah, I have all that I need right now.

### Thoughts on this list?
* I think I like this app better.

### What was the last thing you filled and when?
* I think it was my inhalers in February.

### How was the process? 
* Actually for some reason my inhaler wasn’t on the list so I needed to contact the doctors and they put them back on the list. It wasn’t on there at all.

### What do you think of the information presented on each card?
* Its wow. I mean cause the other doesn’t show this right here. It doesn’t show the prescription numbers, and everything like this. It seems like this one is easier. On the other you have to click the box to order and right here you can get the details you refilled last time. I like this.

### When you look at details what are you looking for?
* Like this one I don’t have refills because it has been Discontinued.

### Sounds like its nice to cross check?
* Yeah. This one is the newest one and it shows the quantity and refills left. 

### Do you refer to that information on the day to day?
* Yes so, I know. Some I get for 3 months and others I don’t so I have to keep up with the number I have. I know I said when it gets low.

### When the refill amount gets low? 
* When the medication gets low. I just think this is a better display than the other

### What else is good about it?
* The display alone and it shows the number I have even if they are Discontinued. It has request refill. It just seems like it would be easier to go through this way [button at top].

						

### It lets you focus on what you need?
* Yes. Definitely.
* Then right here I don’t have refills for my anxiety so I can give them a call or send a message.

### Do you often need to call or send a message? 
* Yes. Now that I know I don’t have refills left I can do it easier now. I don’t think it gives the example like this one does.

### Tap into [Filter]. Thoughts on what you'd do here?
* I would click Submitted and Active. If I were to get on this app, I would only want to look at the Active ones. Last month I saw one because my shampoo wasn’t on there anymore and it was Discontinued.

### About the shampoo: did anyone reach out or did you discover it?
* I discovered it, same for my inhaler. I had to reach out to them.

### Thoughts on what you are seeing? 
* I am looking at the Discontinued now. I don’t even see my shampoo on here anymore. I reached out to them about that. I do not see it as Discontinued or anything.

### What would be the next step?
* I would send them a message. I spoke with my doctor about it, and I guess nothing happened yet so I would need to reach back out. They have my cream there but not the shampoo. There’s the cream right there. I like that though.

### Walk through the filter options. To you, what do they mean?						

* Active -active
* On Hold -I assume there’s a wait time
* Parked -I don’t know what that means
* Submitted -I know what means they are processing
* Suspended
* Discontinued -no longer carrying it
* Expired -expired
* Non-Verified- I don’t know why they would be on there. If it’s not verified, then it shouldn’t be in there.
* Transferred -I assume it has been transferred to an outside party.

### Which ones pertain to you?
* Active, refill in process, submitted, discontinued, and expired so I know.
* Pending -would be the refills you have requested to be filled. Tracking is finding out the location and how long it will take for them to get here

### How often do you track packages?
* All the time. Delivery on my phone, app for the post office. I look for it every day so I know what will be coming and if I need to check the mail

### Do they all come through the mail?
* Yes, that is for everything

### Have you ever had any that came late or not show up?
* I have not had anything that didn’t show up.

### Use RX number, do you use that?
* With that information you can call there and say this is my prescription. You can call it in if needed if the internet or Wi-Fi isn’t working. We are so attached to electronics sometimes you have to do it over the phone. Like if there’s a thunderstorm and wi- fi is out. You will still need the medication and use the RX number to fill it.

### Even with no internet, do you think you could still see it here?
* Some people, I am not saying me. You can look at the bottle to.

### What is your preference?
* I just think it is cool that it is on here. Since it is one here, I would look on here if I am on here. If it wont go through you can still call in and give the prescription number. Sites go down and certain things may not go through. If you have that number.

### Anything else about the list?
* No not really.

### Do you ever share this information with anyone?
* Yeah, when I go to the civilian doctor you have to list the medication you are taking. I live 45 minutes to an hour. Sometimes you have to go to urgent care, and they need to know what you take. And if you go to the hospital.

### Do you often see an outside doctor?
* No but I have had to see one. That’s the first thing they ask on the paper is the medication you take. I try to have it printed out since there is a lot of medication.

### How many times do you see the doctor?
* I see the doctor every 6 months, but I see pho9logisits as well. I get blood work done every 3-4 months so they will call after and then go over lab work and we go over all medication. With my anxiety medication we changed it then needed to change it back.

### Do you still see the old ones on the list?
* Yes they will discontinue that one and put the new one on there.

### Is that just in your mind to remember which one?
* It can be, yeah. Like I was taking [medication] and now they put me on a different one but can’t think of the name. The change is something. I was going from taking a half to taking a whole one. This one right here. I would take one 2 a day now I take one 3 times a day. So now I have this one.

### Thoughts on Fill date? 
* Those are the dates that I got that filled. This one was in January, and they send enough so I have them for a good while. They send out 3 months at a time. Those are just little pills and stuff.

### How to reference that date in the future?
* I will count the months. It will have on there “3 month supply”. Soon it’s time for me to order more of those since it was in January and now it is April.

### By "on there" do you mean MyHealtheVet website?
* Yes

### Anything else about prescriptions?
* No

### Since you mentioned it earlier, let’s go to Messages. Any thoughts here? 
* Well, these are some messages that I have sent. I have to look at that one because I haven’t read it yet. I had to let them know I had to take medicine, so I had to let them know I had COVID. I had it for a whole month before Valentine’s Day and trying to bounce back into the swing of things should I say.

### Are all your appointments in-person?
* No. Well mostly no. We have the zooms since covid. I have lab work to go in for. I do see my doctor in person. I think I have an appointment, yeah, that one is in person.

### Have you ever checked in to an appointment?
* Yes. Its to see if you will keep the appointment or cancel right.

### Like a text message?
* Yeah. Then you have to reply to keep the appointment

### For video and in person appointments?
* Yes. Well no let me take that back. Yes. Yes, I think that’s for all of them.

### Do you do that or just go to the appointment?
* I do that often. I would forget an appointment. This one today I was supposed to set a reminder. But ya’ll reminded me by sending a message to remind me. Brain fog from COVID is real. I am happy about the text and email reminders to let me know that I need to do this here.

### What do they ask you to do for the appointment?
* I think I have one. Yeah, here’s one. There. 

### More of a reminder?
* Yeah.

### It is good that they spell it out whether it is video or in person?
* Yeah. I had another one but I can’t seem to find it. I am looking on my iPad, but I can’t find it on here either.

### Travel when in person?

* Yes, I had one March 16th and I am waiting on that to come in. There have been some times they had me go to TN and I never got reimbursement for that. Yeah that wasn’t very good.

### Why wasn’t it reimbursed?
* The way they were doing it there was filling out the paper and put it in the bin. I had to go twice, and it was 2 hours away. I think they said after 30 days there was nothing they could do. Now there is an app that you can go through. I like the kiosks there where you scan the idea and say this is it. The paper way is not good but the app and kiosk is good. They can lose the paper, or it does not get to the right person, this way it went right through.

### Prescription data, have you ever seen a fill date set in the future?
* No.

## Closing

### Wave magic wand on the app, what would you change? 
* I actually like it. I hope I do not have any Unknown [prescriptions]. What I see right now I really like this app. I would get rid of the Discontinued so I can just have my Active ones. Also get rid of Expired. You can customize it as well. 
* [Filters the list to Active] That’s cool. Now I can just see 12 active ones instead of 22.

### Anything else?
* No that’s about it.
