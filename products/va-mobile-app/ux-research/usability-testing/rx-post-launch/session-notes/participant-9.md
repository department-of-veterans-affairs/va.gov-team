# Participant 9
Assistive Tech (AT) user. VoiceOver on iPhone.


## Warm-up

### Leading up to this session, how did you learn what the session is about?
* I think it is about ordering medication

### Where did you find that? 
* I am not even sure. It was a few weeks ago. Since then, I have been to winter sports clinics and to multiple events.

### When did you download the app? 
* Years and years ago. I will say 2006 or 2007 or something like that.

### Is it the VA Health and Benefits app? 
* I just know of one. MyHealtheVet. You want the one with just VA. That one a few years ago.

### Is VoiceOver on right now?
* Yes.

### From the Rx Refill app, we want to get into the Health and Benefits app: 
* Okay I need to go to the medical folder [organized on iPhone]. This one.

### How frequently do you use it (daily, weekly, monthly)? 
* Yeah, I think this is the one I was just in I am thinking. I wasn’t in the prescription on just then. I was just at the perception part of it. Yeah. I think I am already signed in. Yeah. Let me go grab that code real quick. It’s just a one-time code.

### How’s this process as you go through?
* It’s just a one-time code. Every time you do it, they send you a code.

## General (Rx at VA)

### How do you manage meds today? 
* I refill online and that’s what I do on the app. I refill on the app through this.

### This one or Rx?
* Both. A lot of times I will use my iPad more than my phone, but it is this app. I use the Rx one but the issues with that one is that you can only see one line at a time, and you swipe through and there is only one line, so it is kind of like, I don’t know. It just isn’t open so you can’t see everything you have done so I like using this one better.

### Do you manage any non-VA meds? 
* No all medication is through the VA. I saved some refills for today.

### How did you fill a prescription the last time? 
* I used this app.

### Thoughts on that process?
* It is what I use. I guess it is the only way I know to refill my meds.

### Are there any snags that occur?
* No, the only thing is the other app (Rx Refill). With this one, not really. Not any that I can remember.

### Anyone that helps you or do you do it on your own?
* I do it on my own

## Refill Process**

_Research moderator will mostly be in observation mode for this portion of the study. The moderator will invite the participant to speak aloud as they refill a prescription in the app. If the participant does not have an Active prescription to work with, they will walk through their recent experience refilling a prescription in the app._

[Navigating the mobile app with VoiceOver on iPhone]

* I just can’t believe you can’t hear that. So, this is telling me about my artificial tears, tells me the RX number, refills left and last fill date. I clicked it and chose it. Everything you see on the screen talks to me. I double click to choose it.

### How fast is the setting when you tap it, where is yours?
* There is a percentage 100 to 0. Mine is talking about 65 percent.

### When using it and swiping through what in particular do you listen for?
* It is just like someone is talking to you. It is talking to you and saying everything really fast. You know what it is saying, and you get use to it. If you were to slow it down to 50 percent. That is reasonable for you. Anything less will drag. At 50 it would sound like people are talking. We get so use to it like sighted people. You look at the whole page and we do the same thing when hears. We speed listen instead of speed reading. As I swipe through, I will read it as quick as it is saying it. Do you see how fast that said that.

### Do you ever swipe before they finish?
* Yeah, it was about to tell me the facility, but I’ll just tap with two fingers to shut it up. Yeah so, I shut it up when it got to the facility. I want to know Refill and Fill date.

### What do you use the fill date for?
* That tells me when it was last filled so I keep up with that to make sure I am not filling too early so my timing is on track. It tells me when it was filled last

### How often do you go refill?
* Every 90 days. Most of the prescriptions are 90 days. So, I do it every 90 days.

### I noticed you tapped into the one with the two prescriptions [Start refill request at top], do you ever bypass that button and look at the list?
* Yes. This one gave me the ones that I could fill. Now this is new, so it doesn’t always do that. When you have to go through old prescriptions it was frustrating. This is new and before this I would sort by new to oldest or whatever then I would go through that. I would ask my doctor to take off the Expired ones off so it would be cleared up for me. It was cumbersome to listen to it all. I like the new feature that shows me what is available.

### What would you Sort by: 
* I would Sort new to old. I would first put ones that aren’t Expired. So, I think I have 9 of these. I will do this then go back and do that.
* We would go back to the top; it could tell me all 40 which I don’t have all 40. You can filter them, sort them. I go in and click on Active you know. Yeah, that’s what I filter as. I filter for Active ones. Parked, Submitted, Suspended, Discontinued, Expired, Non-Verified, Transferred, Unknown. That will now be filtered by Active. I filter by medication name, and I can also look at all 40. Now it will show me all of them. Wait that’s Expired

### Was that surprising?
* I had it filtered. This is Active. So now it is telling me what it is and now the instructions you know. This is just as fast as its talking. [Reads screen] I have to write that down so I can send it to my doctor. I already sent it in to be refilled because its my allergy pill so I will send that to my doctor through my HealtheVet so I can get refills on it

### My HealtheVet, on there do you use Secure message?
* Yes.

### Did you know the app has secure message?
* Yes, it does umm hm. I use it on the app too. I used it yesterday. That other one they never even sent it to me. The diphenyl is my allergy as well. I will just write a message here. I just got a new doctor so he wouldn’t refill everything. They were waiting for them to end so he could put his name on the new refills. Actually, when I get off of here, I will go through these again and record it so I will let my recording add it onto the message.						

### So you would video record the screen and upload that video to send as a scure message?
* I record the VoiceOver of the medication and milligrams so that way when I record, “Hi Doctor…I am needing refills on these medications as soon as possible”. and then I start my recording and it will print out what the recording is saying. That way I don’t need to write it.

### Do you do it often?
* No, I haven’t had to do it because when I needed refills, I had a doctor’s appointment so I would just ask them to check what I am low on, and he would add refills. I just got a new doctor, and he didn’t want to refill anything and wanted to write a new prescription when they ran out. This is my first time doing this.

### It’s good to see you both on the same page?
* Yes. Then he needs to look into the computer and see how many mg it was. I don’t think he needs the RX number because it will be a new number since he is prescribing it.

### Wave magic wand on the app, what would you change? 
* I would put a button up there to send refill request to doctor.

### What would that do for you?
* That would be good because the computer would send the refill request to the pharmacy or the doctor. However, it gets there it would make it so that the doctor would have it precise. I could call the doctor and ask for meloxicam for 10mg when it really is 15. This way it is coming from the computer, and I don’t need to worry about it being wrong since it is from the computer. I think they do that at CVS and the pharmacy sends it to the doctor.

### Clarifying: are you talking about a Renewal or refill?
* Not a renewal. When I was there he should’ve went in and did all that. Even when I send in a refill, he knows he has to rewrite them so. Still the same thing. You know what I am saying

### How are your Renewals done?
* I had my doctor for a lot of years. This is the first time having to do any of this myself. Yeah. My doctor left in November when a lot of doctors left from VA. So, before he left, he gave me my refills and I am just now running out. I saw him a week or two before he left. He never said a word and like I said he was gone then the new doctor said let’s just wait for them to run out and he could have rewrote them and expired the other ones, but you know he did it this way so...

### Do you think it was easier for him or did it cause a delay?
* It would’ve been easier for him to write them right then because all he needed to do was copy and paste. Now how long is he going to take to rewrite all of them all at once. Some people make more work for themselves. When I had my old doctor, he did [the refill] right then and they just came in his name.

### Sounds like that was less of a burden on you. 
* Yeah, and now I have to bring it to his attention and I’m the blind one. Some blind people can’t do this. I live alone. We ask a lot of the blinded veteran and they say their wife did this and that. I said I need a wife because she [sounds] amazing. They say, “well, I wouldn’t say she’s amazing because of this or that”. And I say she can be my wife and you can go home alone. We will take her. He was nice to her after that. She does everything and sounds amazing, and he didn’t appreciate her. She’s a wonderful wife and does everything. He doesn’t talk negative anymore. He said he doesn’t know how to use a washing machine. We were messing with him after that. Chalk one up for the wife after that like what would you do with her. She fries chicken, she even cuts his steak for him. I need me one of them. I don’t think husbands do as much as wives anyways. Most blind women are single anyways, husbands leave real quick.

### How long have you been using the VoiceOver technology?
* I lost my vision 4 years ago so let’s see. I spent a year or 18 months sitting in the dark alone not knowing what to do, then I went to virtual lessons. With that I answered the phone and did texting, and voice over makes you mad at first because you tell it to do something, and it sends something else, and they write back what. I’m like I didn’t say that. You can’t type in what you want it to say so it needs to be trained. When I see something using voice over to stick with it. I saw someone mumbling and her phone understand everything that she is saying. It will grab your voice and tone and everything and it will adapt and get messages right so hang in there. It will get it. If you are desperate enough, you will use the things that you have. I do have some vision and I went back last September because all I have now is light, not functional vision at all. I needed to learn everything “black-out”. They would’ve given me everything new, but I didn’t want new learning curves. I wanted everything black out. At that time, I have 3 feet of movement and light and I could get letters every now and then, but I learned everything black out and it was much easier that’s why I am quicker. When you are trying to scramble or do things with the little bit of vision it is easier to imagine it in your head and just do it. It’s much quicker. The little bit of vision just slows you down. I was living out of a peep hole and it’s like nah uh.

_(START: participant-led session content, can skip)_ 

### Are you fully “black-out” now?
* I have 3 feet of light, but someone could walk in front of me, and I can’t see them, I can see or read. It just registers light. I say 3 feet, but I beg to differ. I went skiing and I couldn’t see him when he was right in front of me. Like right in my face, I could sense it and I still had light in my eye. I don’t know where the light was, but I couldn’t see any movement.

### Discussing the fun they had with Disabled American Veteran (DAV) Winter Sports: 
* Yeah, I would be booking down the hill. They were like you’re a speed demon and it doesn’t feel like I am going that fast. He would tell me where to go and I feel like I am doing more traversing. They were like you’re going 60-70 miles an hour and it didn’t feel like that. I was sit skiing because my ankle is fused and has apostrophe form the ankle down. So as a matter of fact, you can see the screen, so I’ll show you the video. It was hard to have him up there because I had to turn with him, and I was like whys this so hard. I asked someone and they said he had to ride on the back of it. It is a lot of fun. I also did curling. Let me bring it up. It won’t let me bring it up. Let me see if I can do this again. Can you see that. I don’t know if they took videos of me. They had us doing that and sweepers were out there and we yell sweep sweep sweep. That’s what makes it go faster. The circle we are in there’s another one down there so we are trying to get it there so others would be like “stop sweeping”. We were all yelling, it was so much fun.

### How do you get points in curling? 
* That’s how you get points it’s the same thing as Botche. Whoever is the closest to the circle, you get points. However, more is closer without someone else being closer. If I have 4 together and you were beside my 5th one then I would get 4 points. We lost everything, that lady was helping the other team. She’s gently place one near there. She knows how to place. That’s the VA winter sports clinic. It was a lot of fun, I learned a lot of good stuff. There is a summers sport clinic. I am not going every winter. I don’t know I did enjoy it, it was a lot of fun. Yeah.

_(END: participant-led session content. Back to the research questions)_

### Anything else on the app you would keep or change?
* I like the new feature to look at medication that is available for refill. That is great to have so you don’t need to look at all of them. Then when refills when they are out have a button that says request refills.	

### Messaging doctors about a particular one as well?
* Yes exactly.

### What would you tell a veteran family or friend?
* I would tell them this is the best way to order meds and keep up with it. It really is simple, there is no hard learning curve to it. It is simple just tap and swipe. Thank you for doing this and helping us. A lot of things are not accessible and this is the way to get it there and we appreciate it.

### Is there anything else that you’d add?
* Just that one button (Send refill request to doctor) is all that I can think of right now.
