## Warm up

What services do you use VA for? 
* I access it pretty regularly on my phone and computer. Especially for refills but really if I had any feedback, I think I don’t know if it was more on the computer, but I would login via DS login. When switching back and forth form benefits the health side there is a lag. I have verification issues. I feel like it works better now that I use the app instead of the computer. When I use the app, it is easier to go from benefits to health than it used to be. I also feel like I have always had a decent experience without using it. I think that my complaint use to be switching over to different websites and having to verify yourself multiple times. Since using the app besides getting kicked out here and there, I use my face recognition because I have memory issues. By the time I get kicked out again I will need to reset passwords. I am looking to see if I have any other feedback. Typically, my issue is getting signed in and making sure I can get signed in.

Do you use the mobile app? 
* VA.Gov first thing I see is claims healthcare letters and payments. This is what I see then I go to prescriptions, and it has everything. The other thing is that because I do have primary care doctors that is a civilian, so I see VA for some prescriptions and then I see another doctor for other prescriptions. I do that because the medication I need I don’t always get from va. The ones I am talking about are for my diabetes. I can get more advanced medications through them than what the VA offers me. I get some at the VA and others not

Is your civilian doctor through community care? 
* No, my husband is retired Air Force so we have Tricare. Then I have it through my employer as well.

## General (Rx at VA)
### Do you manage any non-VA prescriptions? 
* My diabetes and I take care of it here. Then all of my service-connected disabilities I go to the VA for, mental health, asthma, allergies. All of that. Sometimes it is just easier to message my prairie care to fill the prescription. I do that a lot because of easy access. For example, if you see my prescription, I have some that I am out of so I need to message them, and they will say then I need to see someone then the appointment is 3-4 weeks out. It is not as easy. If I have an expired prescription, if I call the pharmacy, they will autumnally call the doctor for approval. VA doesn’t do that. I need to message them then they have to schedule an appointment. It is not easy to get medication from the VA for anything. Once a year I will meet with my doctor, a lot of them are expired. I have been on blood pressure for years and they didn’t use that anymore, so they switched me, so I need to check my blood pressure. The VA does that a lot. My other doctor doesn’t do that. All of my mental health medication expired 3-4 months ago, and I have to wait for an appointment to get those refilled.

### Do you have a lot of follow up appointments and changes in meds?
* Yes, because some of the conditions I have medications don’t always work like migraines. I have tried different medication that don’t seem to help. I started to get Botox for them but that doesn’t work either. Honestly, I don’t know who is following more for migraines but honestly I wouldn’t even know how to get that refilled. Do I tell her what I am using for her to refill or do I talk to the neurologist to remind them. For what do is the Botox and now I have expired medication and I don’t use it. So, when I run out, I will need to figure that out. I don’t even know who my primary care doctor is because they switch so often they may tell me who to go to. For a lot of my issues I get a lot of allergy medication, I haven’t seen them for a while. It is an issue getting a prescription because I see so many people, ENT, Allergy,, if you have issues with ENT they will tell you to talk to someone else. It is not an easy way to manage things. I find that going to the private doctor I can even send a message to my doctors outside of the VA and say I am out of this prescription can you send it to the pharmacy. I can get medication outside that I can't get in the VA. They will give me the meds that are within 1 but I would prefer just 1 medication instead of two.

### How did you fill a prescription the last time? 
* I just do it on the app or on the laptop. If I refill here. A lot of the time if it is active I just click the request refill and it will refill. It really is super easy to fill it on the app. I typically make refills and refill everything. If it is active and I have refills I will get the refill. This is one I know I am taking and it is really pretty easy to do. I just filled that one. It is super easy, so I think this is what it looks like on my laptop. Anything I have available I can select it. This is how I typically do it, if it is available I do it all at once

### Which way do you prefer? 
* Refill in a batch because they are all mailed to me. Even when I would get injectables it was mailed to me and had dry ice and whatnot. I have never went in for a prescription. The app is definitely easier for everything. Even when I had a disability claim pending. It is the easiest way to go. Medication, secure message, it is all a lot easier. For me if I can click the app, verify my face and not have to put in a password and click on that then that. Sometimes I have to do it on the iPad. Prefer it all in one spot.

### Does anyone help you to do these things?
* No. You see the Active: Submitted, I refilled as I was talking to you.

### Please walk through the [Filter] list? 
* I see that I need to get ahold of my doctor and reconnect. The other thing I can say is that the benefit for me of refilling in batches, if I have some left this one I don’t use it its like a tube. It was prescribed as a nasal wash. When the VA sends me a huge batch, I will use it as needed. I may not run out right away. This other one was a capsule, so they changed it to liquid. I will rinse them out. I won’t wait until I run out. I will refill in the batch so I have a collection of those. I didn’t think this one worked, I sued it for months. For the cost I don’t think there was a benefits. I didn’t see the change they wanted. This flutica is like Flonase. I prefer other medication I can get together rather than two meds. The VA will not prescribe the one that I take. I don’t even know the name of this one. The other thing about the pharmacy is that they switch things up like they can’t get it and don’t use it. At some point I wanted the VA to manage my diabetes but they would say we don’t do that or don’t have that. I pay out of packet to a meter. I asked them for one and they said I needed an appointment. I pay 100 a month for the monitor to measure the blood sugar, I am hoping to get one. I understand that sometimes the alleger medication that I have been on for 20 years so they may not work effectively so that is why I will stop taking them. Seeing that list, I also pick up a lot from my local pharmacy. There was a point I had 17 that I had to take on a daily basis and they weren’t that effective. I feel like if they could be better than you cannot directly do. I cannot send a message directly to allergies. I am seen in that clinic, but I cannot send the message to them. The [City] VA is huge, this is the list I see. This is the list, I don’t know who gets put on here …[reading List] I don’t know what that means, “MH Hous%”. So, what I do is picking the women’s clinic. I don’t even know which one I am in but I would send a message and hope the right person gets it. The list of people I send a message to I will go to my inbox and see who I talked to so I will click and reply to get my message to them. Composing a message isn’t easy when I don’t know what the codes mean. If I had it difficult then an older veteran would have issues. I said I couldn’t get a hold of the allergy but I see I can message them. I could do that to see if I can get an appointment.

### On the Prescription list, when scrolling. Do you ever need to reference these again, useful to have them on the list? 
* Not really. I wish there was a way to make a note. I am sure I told them that I don’t use this one because it causes dry mouth. If you could put a note or symptom. There are a lot of things I say don’t work and I do tell them. When they switched this one, it was under control before and I told my provider this one isn’t working as well. I mean that’s not put on there. I am allergic to this one but they keep prescribing it. I have seen it in my file that I am allergic to that. That’s the thing we don’t get a lot of say in the changes. They just automatically send the new one. I didn’t ask for it but okay. We don’t have much say in it.

### When you go on here and you look for refills do you have in your mind the name to refill or how do you indicate? 
* Yes, I do. I take a lot, but I do know the prescriptions I take regularly like blood pressure meds are taken each day. So, I know those pretty well. I guess the answer is yes, I know the medication and what to look for. I may not know what this one is, but I know it is B12. At least on the bottle it says B12 and right there. Even this one I just know what it is

###  What about the information on the cards? 
* That is helpful. Even knowing why, I am taking it is helpful. 

###  Do you see [Filter]? 
* Yes

### Have you filtered anything?
* No

### Why?
* I just scroll through the list.						

### Let’s walk through the Filter list. To you, what do these mean? 
* On Hold, Parked, I don’t know. Refill in process meaning its coming. I think Submitted is me asking and waiting for them to get it. Suspended I don’t know what that means. Discontinued is when …why get rid of it and don’t have it. Expired.. it is expired. Non-verified I don’t know. Transferred when you transfer outside medication to VA. I don’t think it is easy to transfer medication. I have thought about it before. Unknown I don’t know.

###  If you didn’t know, how would you find it out? 
* I would send a secure message to ask. That doesn’t say anything. I don’t have anything in-process, maybe I just submitted it. Those are the two I submitted earlier. They are pending. Discontinued, those are the two. Expired, I have a lot of those which is weird because I know that they don’t carry this one anymore. When I requested a refill they told me they didn’t have it anymore. I don’t know what Non-Verified it. I don’t think I have ever Transferred one. That’s all I got. I knew what Active was.

###  Did you tap on the definitions before?
* No. First time

### Any reason why?
* I don’t know. I kind of knew what it meant. I have been taking medication for a long time so I knew what it meant. I wouldn’t need to be like oo what does that mean.

### What about the tabs at the top (All, Pending, Tracking)?
* These right here. I was looking at Tracking before. I have never, because of how I would batch fill them I don’t even. How I set up my medication: I have a dispenser with the dates. I just pour it all in. I have all of my cholesterol medication which isn’t the smart way because they wouldn’t know what it is. I know which are which. So when I look at that people would be like wow okay but in my mind I know. So I can take the ones I need. That’s how I set it up, which occasionally they do. A blood pressure is a white capsule it use to be yellow. I don’t track in a way, I have it early enough or like oh my god I need it now. I make sure I am refilling it so I can see if I am getting low. I will look through to see if I have refills and if I don’t I request a refill. SO that’s how I manage it. I don’t have little children so I can keep it next to my best. I take insulin so there’s a mini fridge by my med which has all of the injectables. I have a ton of medication by my bed. I am not tracking. It takes a few days and I know it will be in my mailbox.

### How do you know when you need a refill?
* I visually see it getting low, so I look for a refill. Those are the medications, cholesterol, blood pressure, diabetics, b12. Then like an anti-vomiting med but take it with Motrin. I only take half a pill so it lasts longer and it’s only when I need it. I can’t take a full pill because it will knock me on my butt. It has lasted me a long time. I track it visually. Then when the bottles out I need to get a refill

### Is that a controlled substance?
* I don’t know I have just refilled it through the va. It has been on my list I haven’t needed to go on my list. If it is controlled that I haven’t done anything for it

### Have you ever had to manage a controlled substance? 
* No if that is a controlled substance that's the only one I get. I have an appointment for my medication for mental health and I have been on and off. I took it for a while and it works in the beginning then stops. If I start and stop, if I don’t see it being useful then I stop taking it. There are some that work so I use it or if I know my blood pressure is good so I will keep taking it. If I don’t know or don’t feel like it works, I won’t take it. Why am I putting it in my body. I know at one point I had 17 prescriptions. It was ridiculous. Even for diabetes alone, its pills, injectable and a night time pill. It is under control but if it’s not working then I go off of it. I can monitor it like I am up 30 points so I can control it that way. I see it daily, you can’t monitor it through mental health so I don’t know. You can’t really measure that I just go by how I feel. Same with the allergies, I was taking multiple medications and there is a lot of stuff that I have been given to help that may or may not have helped.

### Aside from mental health appointments, how many times over a year do you interface with VA? 
* It really depends. I feel like a lot of my conditions are hopeful like allergies, sinus, and mental health. No matter how many times I go to the ENT or allergy I feel like they cannot do anything to help me. I have taken every allergy pill under the sun, and it hasn’t worked. When you are on them for 3-4 years it really helping. I feel miserable due to allergy sinus and migraines. I have it. I will say I am busy, I work full time, I have 4 kids, I am in school. I have a lot going on and a high pain tolerance. So, I will deal with a lot until I have to take care of this. I have not had issues with medication. Getting quality medication like you can on the outside. I haven’t had an issue with doctors appointments. I was going to have another surgery but then my mom was in the hospital. There is a lot that depends on if I am active in the VA. In the last 6 months I haven’t been able to take care of me because I have to take care of my mom. I haven’t had issues getting care through the va. I had a sinus surgery that was my second one. After the first I have relief for 10 years than after the second one. There is no working together. They say it is allergies and I have been dealing with it for 30 years. I don’t know how you fix that. Part of that is discouraging for me. It’s like I have tried every drug, allergy shots, like what now. I don’t know.

### Anything else you want to tell us?
* No.
