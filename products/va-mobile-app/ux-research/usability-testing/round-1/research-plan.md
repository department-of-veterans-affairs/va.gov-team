# Research Plan for Round 1 of Usability Testing of High Fidelity MVP Mobile App

August 31, 2020

# What product & team?
VA Mobile App Team, MVP Mobile App

# Background
In previous rounds of user research, we have determined that there is a Veteran desire for a VA mobile app and defined an MVP feature set in conjunction with technical discovery efforts. We have designed a high fidelity prototype of the core MVP UX, and we would like to usability test this design with Veterans. 

# Goals
- **Assess the effectiveness and clarity of the app IA and navigation UI**
  - Identify obstacles to navigating around the app using the bottom toolbar and homescreen CTAs
  - Identify obstacles to locating Personal & Contact Information
  - Identify obstances to locating Direct Deposit
  - Identify obstacles to locating VA Letters and Documents
  - Identify obstacles to locating Settings
- **Assess the home screen design**
  - Determine how useful the "notification cards" are
  - Determine if including multiple CTAs to the same feature is confusing
- **Assess the desired content on Profile, Direct Deposit, Letters and Documents, and Settings**
    - Understand what information Veterans respond well to and what else they would like to add
- **Assess the desired content on the mobile app Claim Status Tool**
    - Understand what information Veterans respond well to and what else they would like to add
- **Assess Veteran perception of the MVP app overall**
  - Determine if participants are satisfied or unsatisfied with MVP app features

# Research questions
- How do Veterans express the value of biometric sign in?
  - How useful is this?
  - Do Veterans have any concerns about it?
- How easily and successfully can Veterans find the following items, and what patterns and obstacles exist in finding them: 
  - Homescreen
  - Personal & Contact Information 
  - Direct Deposit
  - Letters and Documents
  - Settings
  - Using the bottom toolbar navigation
    - Do users find any of the icons and titles in the bottom toolbar unclear? If so, what?
    - Do Veterans think that the Veterans Crisis Line should be in the bottom toolbar?
    - Where do users run into problems navigating around the app?
  - Using the in-page cards and list items on the home screen
    - Do users find any of the cards or list items unclear? If so, what?
    - Do Veterans use in-screen CTAs more than the bottom toolbar?
    - Do they come back to the home screen before navigating elsewhere?
- What information would Veterans most like to see on the mobile app Claim Status Tool?
    - What is not included that they want to see? 
- Overall, how satisfied are Veterans with the MVP feature set and overall app UI/UX design?
    - Would participants download and use this app? 
    - What would the most like to add to what they see in the MVP prototype? 


# Hypothesis 
**Assess the effectiveness and clarity of the app IA and navigation UI**
1. The bottom toolbar navigation elements will mostly be usable and clear to Veterans
2. Veterans will be able to successfully find Personal & Contact Information, Direct Deposit, Letters and Documents and Settings

**Assess the home screen design**
3. Veterans will use homescreen cards and list items to navigate from the homescreen more than the bottom toolbar
4. Once away from the homescreen, Veterans will use the bottom toolbar to navigate

**Assess the desired content on the mobile app Claim Status Tool**
5. Veterans will want to see more information about a claim's status, including information that's not in the current CST

**Assess Veteran perception of the MVP app overall**
6. Veterans will want to download and use this app
7. There may be dissatisfaction with features that are not available in the MVP (e.g. cancelling and scheduling an appointment)
8. There may be dissatisfaction with the limited health features



# Method

## What method of research are you planning?
Remote user interviews with 6-8 of Veterans over the course of 1 week. Each of these interviews will be moderated and conducted remotely using Zoom. The sessions will be led by targeted tasks that lightly cover the prototype overall with the purpose of testing the IA and Navigation UI. We will test a mobile prototype on a mobile device. 

## Why this method?
This method will allow members of the VA Mobile App team, and the teams we are overlapping with, to observe sessions. It will also allow us to speak with a diverse population of Veterans located across the United States. Using a mobile prototype on a mobile device will allow us to understand mobile-specific UX issues we can improve upon (e.g. icon size, type size). 

## Where are you planning to do your research?
We will use the Perigean zoom account. We will work with Perigean beforehand to ensure participants have downloaded Zoom onto their mobile Apple device. We will send a link to the Invision prototype via the Zoom chat for participants to open. Once participants have opened the prototype, we will ask them to share their screen with us.

## What will you be testing?
- Interactive high-fidelity Invision prototype of the MVP VA mobile app (iPhone SE size, 320px width). This prototype will expand to fit the width of larger Apple devices. 

## Participants and Recruitment
- We would like to interview 6-8 Veterans. Participant criteria: 
  - All participants must be Veterans
  - **All participants must be iOS users and use an Apple mobile device (not an iPad) for the session**
  - **All participants be currently going through the claims or appeal process for Disability Benefits**
    - Ideally, most recruits should have experience with VA Health Care benefits as well. We are flexible on this, having an active claim is more important.  
  - Participant pool should be diverse in:
    - Branch of service
    - Gender 
    - Race
    - Age (ideally at least one participant 25 or under and one participant 65+, but we are flexible)
    - Geography
    - Density (ideally at least one participant in a rural area and one in a major city, but we are flexible)
  - All participants should have used VA.gov in the past
  - No assistive device users (low-fi prototype does not support assistive technology)

  
## What is your recruitment strategy?
1. Perigean will recruit
2. In order to get 6-8 participants, we would like Perigean to schedule 10 participants total, with the expectation that there be a max of 4 no-shows.

## When?
1. Timeline for this study: September 8-11, depending on recruitment. We can also do September 14-16. 
2. Length of Sessions: Schedule for 1 hour (plan to go for 45 minutes)
3. Availability: Tuesday-Friday (11 AM EST – 6 PM EST). Please don’t schedule back to back sessions if possible. 
4. Prepare: We will conduct a pilot interview Thursday 9/3.
