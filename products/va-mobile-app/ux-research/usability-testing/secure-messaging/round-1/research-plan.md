# Research Plan for Round 1 of Usability Testing of VA MVP Mobile App Secure Messaging Prototype

## What product & team?

VA Mobile App

## Goals
The Secure Messaging VA Mobile App team is conducting testing to understand usability obstacles, ask questions, and get feedback from Veterans on an MVP secure messaging feature we are developing. The outcome of this research will inform how we approach the implementation of Secure Messaging in the MVP mobile app.

### Background

In previous rounds of [user research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-research), we have determined that there is a Veteran desire for Secure Messaging to be included in the VA MVP mobile app. We have designed a prototype of the core Secure Messaging UX, and we would like to test this design to assess the following.

### Research question
- What experiences and issues do Veterans have when communicating with VA and outside providers? 
  - What are the pain points or gaps in health communications?
- What are the Veteran key experiences and issues with Secure Messaging on the web?
	- Are there known pain points or gaps in their past experience sending messages on My HealtheVet?
- Answer the following on the effectiveness and clarity of the app IA and navigation UI:
	- Does a separate home screen for Health make the app more complicated or confusing?
	- What are the obstacles to navigating the health section using the bottom toolbar, CTAs, and Back button?
- How easily and successfully can Veterans find the following items, and what patterns and obstacles exist in finding them:
	- Inbox
	- View Message
	- Folders / Sent Messages
	- Compose a Message
	- Attachments
- What is the Veteran perception of the prototype overall?
	- Are participants satisfied or unsatisfied with Secure Messaging MVP features?
	- How does it compare to the current web My HealtheVet experience?

### Hypothesis

- Veterans find the current Secure Messaging on My HealtheVet very valuable but will have pain points to share and/or suggestions on improvements.
- Veterans who use other mobile messaging apps to communicate with outside (non-VA) providers will have different expectations than Veterans who only use My HealtheVet Secure Messaging.
- Veterans will successfully find Secure Messaging in the Health section either by CTA button or bottom navigation.
- Once away from bottom navigation Veterans will be able to use the Back navigation to get around.
- Veterans will be able to successfully navigate to Inbox, View, and Compose a Message.
- Veterans will be able to find and navigate Folders.
- Veterans who don’t use Folders may not value this feature.
- Veterans will expect to get notified of new messages from push notifications on their phone.
- There may be dissatisfaction with features not available (Drafts or Delete).
- Veterans will express high interest in using an app that has Secure Messaging.
- There may be dissatisfaction that VA prescriptions features (refill, view, track) are missing from the app.
- Veterans may have questions about other app features (Claims and Appointments CTAs, bottom navigation, etc).

## Method

### What method of research are you planning?

- Remote user interviews with 6-8 Veterans.

- Each of these interviews will be moderated and conducted remotely using Zoom.

- We'll ask Veterans to download Zoom onto their device prior to the research session.

- We'll send Veterans the link to the Invision mobile prototype via Zoom, and ask them to share their screen with us.

### Why this method?
This method will:
- Allow members of the VA Mobile App team, and the teams we are overlapping with, to observe sessions
- Allow us to speak with a diverse population of Veterans located across the United States
- Allow us to understand mobile-specific UX issues we can improve upon (e.g. icon size, type size)

### Where are you planning to do your research?
We will use the Perigean zoom account. We will work with Perigean beforehand to ensure participants have downloaded Zoom onto their device.
### What will you be testing?
- Interactive Invision prototype of the VA MVP mobile app Secure Messaging feature. This prototype is an iPhone at 360px width, but will expand to fit the width of larger devices.

## Participants and Recruitment
We would like to interview 6-8 Veterans. Participant criteria:

### Must haves for participants
- All participants must be Veterans
- All participants must use VA health care
- All participants must use Secure Messaging

### Good to have for participants
- Participant pool should be diverse in:
	- Branch of service
	- Gender (30% or more women)
	- Race
	- Age (At least 1 participant 35 or under and 1 participant over 55)
	- Geography (At least 1 person who lives in a rural or remote area and 1 person who lives in a major metropolitan area)
	- At least 1 person with a disability rating of 70% or greater
	- At least 1 person with an identified cognitive consideration of PTSD or TBI

### Recruitment requirements
- All participants must use a mobile device.
- The participants have Zoom downloaded on their phone prior to the session.
- The participants know how to screen-share.

We will not be able to accommodate non-sighted users due to the prototype technology.

### What is your recruitment strategy?
1. Perigean will recruit
2. In order to get at least 6 successful sessions (participants show up and are able to successfully sign in and participate), we would like Perigean to schedule 12 participants total, with the expectation we will have at least a 50% success rate overall.

### When?
1. Timeline for this study: March 8-12, depending on recruitment
2. Length of Sessions: Schedule for 1 hour (plan to go for 45 minutes)
3. Availability: Wednesday-Friday (10 AM EST – 5 PM EST). Please don’t schedule back to back sessions if possible.
4. Prepare: We will conduct a pilot interview on 3/4.
