# Discussion Guide for Mobile App MVP Usability Testing R1

August 31, 2020

# Introduction (2 minutes)
Thank you for joining us today. My name is Bridget and I have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes.

The VA is building a mobile app. I am working with VA to ensure the app is easy to use and clear so it will best serve and meet the needs of Veterans like you. Today, I’d like to share with you a prototype of the mobile app, and see what you think about it. 
- First, I’d like to ask you to complete some tasks for me within the app so we can learn how we can improve the app's design. 
- Then, I’d like to give you control over where we go, and talk more generally about how you feel about what you see in the app -- what you’re excited about, what you think is missing, etc. 

Sound good? 

# Logistics (2 minutes) 
A couple other things I'd like to mention before we begin: 

- Our conversation should take ~45-50 minutes. 
- My goal is to help VA build a usable app. I will not be offended by any opinions you express - please be as honest as you feel comfortable being.
- You'll be interacting with a prototype. This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be tapable, and some will not. None of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- Lastly, if it’s alright with you, I would like to record our conversation. We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately & we delete them after we complete analysis. Are you comfortable if I record the screen and audio?
  - If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

Those are all the logistics. Do you have any questions for me before we get started?

# Tech Set Up (8 minutes)
Before we start, I want to make sure we are ready to go with technology for this session:
- Can you confirm for me what type of device you're using to join today?
    - Great, that helps me troubleshoot with you if we run into any problems. 
- I'd not like to walk you through how to share your screen with me via Zoom from your device: 
    - When you are inside the Zoom application on your phone, you'll see a few buttons at the bottom. Starting at the left, you'll see Audio, Video, Share Content (green button in the middle of the screen), Participants, and lastly on the far righthand side, three dots labelled More. 
    - If you tap on those dots labelled more on the far right, you'll also see a function called "Chat". 
    - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all th icons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap anywhere on the screen and they'll show up again.
    - The ones that will be important for us today are "Chat" and "Share Content." 
Any questions?

- Now I'd like you to share your screen with me!
    - Tap on the arrow that says "Share content". A menu should come up with options of what to share - please hit "Screen".
    - You should be prompted with an option to select what you'd like to share - please select "Zoom" and then "Screen". Then select "Start Broadcast". 
    - If you see any additional prompts please read them aloud and I will help.
    - Ok, tap anywhere on the screen to go back to the Zoom application.

Great, now I can see your phone screen! Thank you for your patience in figuring this out with me so we can look at a prototype together today.

_Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:_
- Ok, it seems like we're having some trouble getting the prototype up on your screen. I'm really excited for you to participate though, so what we're going to do today is have me share my screen, and then I'm going to have you "drive". You will tell me what to do, what to tap, on, etc. Does that sound ok?
[Share your screen]. Can you confirm if you can see my screen?

Great. Now we're really ready to begin!

# Warm up (5 minutes)
First I’d love to want to learn more about yourself and your experience with VA. 
- What branch of the military did you serve in and when was your period or periods of service?
- Do you use your phone to manage your VA benefits? If so, how often?
- You indicated you are currently going through the claims process with VA - is that right?
  - Can you tell me about the last time you used eBenefits or VA.gov to file, check up on, or otherwise manage your claim?
  - Was it on desktop, tablet, or mobile?
- Do you use VA health care?

Thank you for sharing all that.

- Alright, I am sending you a link in the chat. Can you navigate to the Chat button, and tap on the link to open it? [Participant opens prototype]

Great, I can see your screen. Before we get started I just want to remind you that this is a prototype - not everything is tapable and it's a demo of what is to come. 

# Biometric sign in and homescreen (5 minutes)
Please open the VA mobile app from the homescreen of this prototype and sign in. 

Now that you are signed in, I’m going to ask you to spend a minute looking at the home screen of your app. Please don’t click, but you can scroll.
- What questions do you have about what you see here?
- In your own words, what is this screen telling you?

**Things to watch for & follow up on if participant brings it up**
- _Does the participant react openly to thumbprint sign in? Is the reaction positive or negative?_

# Profile tasks and discussion (8 minutes)

  - Have you ever managed direct deposit information on VA.gov?
  - If you've updated information, what did you update and why?
- Have you ever downloaded any benefit letters from VA.gov? 

I’m going to ask you to do some things for me in the app. I’m not testing you or your ability, but the prototype! We want to understand if anything isn't clear so we can make it better. 

**Tasks**

If the participant cannot find something: 
- It's alright, let's move on to the next thing I'd like to talk to you about, or:
- Can you tell me a little bit about what you're thinking? I'd love to hear from you about where you'd expect to see this information.

**Things to watch for & follow up on if participant brings it up**
- _Is anything difficult to find?_
- _Is the participant using the 'Back' button alright, or getting stuck?_

**Post-task questions**

  - Going back to your personal & contact information:

  - Do they scroll all the way to the bottom?

**Post-task questions**

  - Starting with the status tab - is there anything else you'd like to see here? Why?
  - Moving into the files tab - is there anything else you'd like to see here? Why?
  - Lastly, the details of your claim - is there anything else you'd like to see here? Why?

Can you navigate back to home? Thank you. 


# Free exploration (5 minutes)
Thank you for letting me ask you to get around the app! Now you're in charge. Feel free to click around the app - anywhere you'd like to go. As you're exploring, I'm here to answer any questions you have. I'd also love to hear what you think if you're comfortable talking out loud as you explore.
- Do you have any questions for me about anything you see?

I'd like to learn from you a bit about how you feel about everything we've talked about today. 
- Do you think this mobile app would change how you interact with VA?
    - If yes, how would it change? 
- Let's imagine again you are talking to a friend who is also a Veteran about this app and you’re telling them about it. What would you say about it?
- Let's say you could add 1 more thing to this app - what would you add? Why?


# Wrap up (2 minutes)
That’s all the questions I have for you today. Do you have any last questions for me?

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on VA’s mobile app and make sure it really works for Veterans like you. Enjoy the rest of your day!
