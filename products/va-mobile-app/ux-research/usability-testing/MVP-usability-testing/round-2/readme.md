# Overall Plan for Jan 2021 Usability Testing:

Weâ€™ll do two types of testing after our internal release around January 2021:


### Method 1: Moderated 60-minute sessions with 5-10 Veterans 

**Goals:** Uncover usability obstacles with sign in, general usability of the app, and Veteran satisfaction with the scope of the app

Some key details:
- We will test directly on mobile devices
- We will test with **Android** users
- We will facilite setup of app prototype via an APK file **during** research sessions.


### Method 2: Unmoderated, passive request for feedback from a TBD number of VA employees

**Goals:** Uncover bugs/issues and other usability feedback

Some key details:
- People will need to have their own LOA3 credentials 
- We will invite people to a Microsoft Teams channel, and there people will provide instructions for how to access the app. The mobile app team will work together to moderate the Slack channel. 
- We want to keep this workflow manageable, so will try to keep this unmoderated. If it turns out that it would be beneficial to have some 30-minute sessions with some testers to ask follow up questions or because they have questions for us, we anticipate having bandwidth for this & being able to schedule out on an ad hoc basis. 


### Assumptions:
- We will not be doing any official app store releases to do testing. The way participants will access the app is either through Test Flight (Apple), or by sideloading an APK file (Android).
