# MVP Mobile App User Research Plan

Last updated October 2020

## Usability Testing
**Goal:** evaluate the usability of the MVP app, identity barriers to using it

### September 9-11: MVP App Usability Testing R1
In September we tested the high-fi prototype of the MVP mobile app. Our research goals were:
- Assess the effectiveness and clarity of the app IA and navigation UI
- Assess the desired content on Profile, Direct Deposit, Letters and Documents, and Settings
- Assess the home screen design
- Assess the desired content on the mobile app Claim Status Tool
- Assess Veteran perception of the MVP app overall

In R1, we used the final 10 minutes of each session to allow the participant to freely explore the app. Between this portion of the interview and the task-based testing, we were able to garner feedback on all the app's features since the MVP is quite small.

### October and November: what's next?
Between now and late November (9 weeks) we would like to focus on the following: 
- Develop the UI/UX for each screen, guided by R1 feedback 
- Define accessibility criteria for each screen
- Build screens
- Design QA and QA screens 
- Deliver MVP into Test Flight
- Release on Test Flight to a small group of internal folks
  - When we do release the app on Test Flight to internal folks, we want to have an open communication line for their feedback.

### Post-November: what's next?
After delivering the MVP into Test Flight in late November, we would like to test the app in Test Flight with Veterans that we recruit with Perigean using the VSP research cycle. We'd like to do this to: 
1. Identify where the usability of the app needs to be improved pre-release by testing the live app on device
2. Test accessibility features such as Voice Over with blind or low vision users

#### Assumptions and unknowns 
- We do not yet have a launch date for the app store, but that date will likely be sometime early-mid 2021. 
- We will have time between the MVP soft internal launch and the app store launch to do testing with Veterans in Test Flight and act on user feedback (likely December-February).

## Product Planning Research
Goal: Evaluate Veteran desirability, technical feasibility, and business feasibility of features

### March-July 2020: discovery research
In addition to September usability testing, we have done 3 additional rounds of discovery research with Veterans that we can lean on to identity post-MVP features on our roadmap:
- [March 2020 discovery sprint](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/discovery-sprint/veteran-desirability/usability-testing/VA%20Mobile%20App%20Discovery_%20Usability%20test%20report.pdf)
- [May 2020 discovery sprint](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-research/user-interviews/research-summary.md)
- [June 2020 prototype testing + co-design research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-research/prototype-testing/testing-summary.md)

### October and November: what's next?
The approach we plan to take in the short-term is:  
- Add tickets to ZenHub (va-mobile-app) identifying features that have high Veteran desirability using March-July research as our guide.
- Tag features as 'fast-follow' or 'post-mvp' depending on our initial estimate of their overall feasibility
- Groom 'fast-follow' tickets with our DEPO stakeholders
- Be ready to build them post-November; possiblty integrate some 'fast-follow' tickets in our MVP delivery

### Post-November: what's next?
- Build out roadmap
- Revisit overarching VA mobile strategy in collaboration with other teams if needed; strategic planning
