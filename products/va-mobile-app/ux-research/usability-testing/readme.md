# Usability Testing Plan

August 2020 

Throughout the development of the VA MVP mobile app, we will conduct at least 4 usability testing sessions with Veterans using an Invision prototype. All testing will focus lightly on the MVP app overall, and dive deep into different features: 

| Round      | Focus Area |
| :----------- | :----------- |
| 1   | 1) IA & Navigation; 2) Profile, Direct Deposit, VA Letters and Documents; 3) Homescreen; 4) What's missing on Claims Status Tool?      |
| 2   | Authentication    |
| 3   | TBD   |
| 4   | TBD   |

In addition to conducting testing using an Invision prototype, we hope to test the app itself along the way as we release features.
