# VA Mobile App Research 


## Discovery: Current Experience


### Q2 2022


# Background


 In an effort to build continuous research into the mobile app team, we are looking to meet with Veterans who currently use the VA Health and Benefits app in order to understand the specific details of their current experience.


 This research initiative will focus on uncovering the experience Veterans have using the VA Health and Benefits app. We will build on the insights surfaced in the original discovery research studies conducted prior to the app’s launch, and through this initiative we will seek to uncover new insights in order to help shape the app’s future roadmap.

#### 
**Measures to increase**



* Completion rate of online transactions
* Usage of digital, self- service tools
* Percent of applications submitted online (vs. paper)

**Measures to decrease**

* Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution
* Time from online benefit discovery to benefit delivery
* Time to successful complete and submit online transactions


## **Veteran Journey**

Since Veterans can download the VA Health and Benefits mobile app any time after establishing benefits with VA, this work impacts the Veteran journey from Starting Up and beyond.


## **Research goals**



1. Gain a deep awareness of the current mobile app experience for Veterans who are monthly active users of the app. Evaluate general usability of the app as well as pain points.
2. Compare Veterans’ feedback using the app now to research findings completed before the app’s launch in order to update our current understanding of the app’s value.
3. Identify Veterans unmet needs and uncover areas where the app could provide future access to other VA health and benefits areas.


## **Outcomes**



* Specific lists of feature areas working well in the app, as well as common pain points.
* Prioritization map of areas to focus on next as new Sprint 0 initiatives in the team’s roadmap
* Evolved understanding of the value the app provides based on user feedback explaining motivations for using the app compared to accessing other digital tools in the VA ecosystem.


## **Research questions**



1. How do Veterans rate the current experience using the VA Health and Benefits app? What things do they like about it, and what are the pain points?
2. What main reasons do Veterans mention for using the app?
3. What types of things do they prioritize using the app for?
4. What types of things do they want to see in the app in the future?
5. How do Veterans describe their digital trust level with the app?


### **Hypothesis**

Veterans who currently use the VA Health and Benefits mobile app use it for quick, transactional tasks, but there are other things Veterans want to be able to use the app to do that they can’t do right now, such as finding out about benefits they might be missing out on.

**Methodology**

This is a moderated, in-person study.

Sessions will take place in the Greater Boston area at the [West Roxbury VAMC](https://www.va.gov/boston-health-care/locations/west-roxbury-va-medical-center/#location-and------------contac) in the conference room adjacent to the Cafeteria. This conference room location as well as the dates and times of June 23rd, 24th, 28th and 29th from 8am EST - 6pm EST have been approved by Patty Roberts, Health Specialist at this location.

The in-person format will allow for both greater inclusivity as well as visibility into touch interactions as Veterans interact in the app. This location was chosen as it is accessible by public transportation, has free parking,  and will provide a sense familiarity for Veterans who visit VAMCs.
