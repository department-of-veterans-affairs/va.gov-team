# Personalized Home Screen - Evaluative Research - MVP
Participant sessions were conducted June 2024  

**Summary**  
Quantitative data analysis indicates that users who initially download the VA Mobile app app do not actively use the app over time, and research participants have also reported that they download the app to see if it can help them (but then don’t use it regularly).  
The VA Flagship mobile app team believes that bringing personalized content to the VA mobile app’s home screen will help new and current app users understand and find value in the app that they aren’t discovering now, help app users keep up with and manage their current interactions across VA, and ultimately help address the dip in retention we’re seeing.
The purpose of this research is to:

* Understand if/how the personalized home screen design impacts participant comprehension of what the VA mobile app can do (in general, and for them specifically). (project success metric)
* Understand if/how the personalized home screen design impacts participant perception of the app’s current and future value. (project success metric)
* Evaluate the usability of the personalized home screen and category screens using high-level tasks that the participants will be asked to complete and determine if any significant usability barriers (including app performance) exist for participants who use the app with assistive technology vs without assistive technology.
* Pilot conducting remote, evaluative research using a live, pre-release build of the app on participants’ mobile devices (including with screenreader users), and improve the instructions and process for that in preparation for future usability studies.
