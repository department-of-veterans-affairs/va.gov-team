# DRAFT VA Mobile App: Personalized Home Screen Evaluative Research - Conversation Guide
March 2024

### Moderator logistics
* 2-3 days before the session:
* Review VA Platform's Research Checklist.
* Complete any project-specific setup tasks for this study
### Day of the session:
* Use #feedback-backchannel in Slack for real-time feedback from observers.
* Mute your Slack notifications.
* Send out the observer instructions to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into #feedback-backchannel).
### Starting the session:
* In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute.
* In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked
* Check your [screensharing setup] and share permissions for participants.
### When the participant joins:
Validate the participant uses the VA Health and Benefits app and get permission for observers to join.
* Thanks so much for joining today. My name is Holly, very nice to meet you.
  * *If session is with a screenreader user:* Also with me today is our Accessibility Specialist, Brea.
* Today we're going to talk about the VA mobile app. Our discussion will help the team understand how to improve the app for Veterans in the future. 
* Before we begin: I have a few people on the team who are interested in listening in to our session as observers. They’re in the virtual waiting room right now. It’s completely fine if you choose to have the session without observers, so let me know what you’d prefer. If it’s ok by you, I’ll have them join. 
*(If the participant agrees, let observers join with their video on. Each observer should come off mute and introduce themselves, and then go back on mute with video off.)*

## Introduction (5 minutes)
* There are a few things I'd like to mention:
  * There are no right or wrong answers, and I won’t be offended by any opinions you express. We just want to hear your opinions, so that we can improve the mobile app and make it work better for everyone.
  * There’s no expectation to provide any personal information. Please feel free to share your thoughts and experiences at the level that’s comfortable for you.
  * This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
  * First, we’ll download and install a special version of the VA mobile app on your mobile device to use during our conversation. Then, we’ll talk together before moving to a part where I’ll ask you to use that special version of the VA mobile app. I will help you get it set up. Before we do that, I want to confirm a few things:
    * Were you able to join our session today using Zoom on your iPhone or iPad?
    * Are you still ok with downloading & installing a special version of the VA mobile app on your phone today?
    * Were you able to check to make sure you had enough room on your phone to download and install it?
    * Last, we are going to need you to be able to log into the VA mobile app using the option you prefer (Login.gov, ID.me or My HealtheVet) with your username and password for our session. Will you be able to do that?
  * Finally, is it ok if I record the audio of our session today? Our team will use this as backup in case we need to refer to something you said. The recordings will be destroyed after.
  * **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. Any minutes you spend with us are valuable today. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop. Just let me know at any point if you’re uncomfortable continuing, and we will end.**
  * Does that all make sense, and sound okay to you?
  * Great! Any questions before we continue?
  * Ok, I'm going to hit the record button now.   

*Start recording.*
  * Once more, for the recording: Is it ok if we record this session?
## Section 1: App setup & screenshare (10 minutes)
 * During our session today, I am going to have you imagine a series of situations using a special version of the VA mobile app and in a few minutes I'm going to send you a link to a special version of the app to explore. We’re going to get all of that set up now.
### Screen share Setup
 * First, I’d like to ask you to share your  device’s screen so I can help you install the app and we can look at it together. I can walk you through how to start the screen share.
*[Help participant share screen]*
   * [iOS: Zoom screen share](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/iphone-start-screen-share)
   * _If they have screen curtain on:_ It looks like you have screen curtain enabled—we’ll need to turn it off. To turn it off—use 3 fingers and quadruple (4) tap.
 * Great, I’m seeing your screen. Now I’m going to help you get the app ready.
