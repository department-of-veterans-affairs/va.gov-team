# VA Mobile App: Personalized Home Screen Evaluative Research Plan
February 2024


## Background
The VA Flagship mobile app was [designed to help Veterans who are actively engaged with VA health and benefits services to keep track of their tasks and interactions across VA](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/product/Product-Outline.md#desired-user-outcomes). 


Quantitative data analysis indicates that users who initially download the app do not actively use the app over time, and [research participants have also reported that they download the app to see if it can help them (but then don’t use it regularly)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-research/post-launch-discovery/July%202023/Mobile%20App%20Retention/Research%20Findings.md#detailed-findings). 
The VA Flagship mobile app team believes that bringing personalized content to the VA mobile app’s home screen will help new and current app users understand and find value in the app that they aren’t discovering now, help app users keep up with and manage their current interactions across VA, and ultimately help address the dip in retention we’re seeing.

## Project Objectives & Goals 
#### [Flagship Mobile App Strategy](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1j0rO2HvDwHDTzunG3judC1HXOiWfGNTXVciLAkurpRw/edit#slide=id.g1e78b87c057_0_159)
- **Vision:** "Each Veteran is connected to the VA services that matter most to them, regardless of device, and without understanding the VA org chart.”
- **Objective 1:** Veterans will use authenticated services that are highly personalized and valuable.
- **Objective 3:** Increase active user base. 

#### [OCTO Priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme)
- **Goal 6:** Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features.

#### Veteran Journey
Since Veterans can download the VA Health and Benefits mobile app any time after establishing benefits with VA, this work impacts the Veteran journey from Starting Up and beyond.

### Previous User Research
We have not previously conducted concept or usability research focusing on the VA mobile app’s home screen.
- [Desk research & discovery exploring personalization broadly](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/features/design-personalization/discovery/readme.md#personalization-2023) was conducted several times from 2021-2023. 
- [VA mobile app user retention discovery research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-research/post-launch-discovery/July%202023/Mobile%20App%20Retention/Research%20Findings.md#detailed-findings) (the study that uncovered the problem the personalized home screen is attempting to solve) was conducted in 2023.

## Research Goals	
Fulfills issue [#2160 ](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/va-mobile-60f1a34998bc75000f2a489f/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app/2160)

**Primary:** 
* Understand if/how the personalized home screen design impacts participant **comprehension of what the VA mobile app can do** (in general, and for them specifically). ([*project success metric*](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/features/design-personalization/product/Personalized_homescreen-Product-Brief-2023.md#metrics))
* Understand if/how the personalized home screen design impacts participant **perception of the app’s current and future value**. ([*project success metric*](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/features/design-personalization/product/Personalized_homescreen-Product-Brief-2023.md#metrics))
* **Evaluate the usability of the personalized home screen and category screens** using high-level tasks that the participants will be asked to complete and **determine if any significant usability barriers (including app performance) exist** for participants who use the app with assistive technology vs without assistive technology. 
  * Tasks focus on features that appear on the home screen within the Activities section and About you. They will be chosen based on the entry points that appear on the user’s personalized home screen (if no entry points appear, we will ask what they expect to be in that section). This could potentially include:
    * Check the status of a disability claim
    * Complete an outstanding health task (refill a prescription, read a new message, check the details of an upcoming appointment)
    * Show proof of Veteran status
    * Find their benefit verification letter

**Secondary:**
  * Pilot conducting remote, evaluative research using a live, pre-release build of the app on participants’ mobile devices (including with screenreader users), and improve the instructions and process for that in preparation for future usability studies.
 
**Outside the scope of this study:**
We will not be evaluating the personalized home screen’s impact on task completion (that will be handled using analytics), the impact on the value of the app to users over time, the usability of features that are surfaced on the home screen, or the personalized home screen’s impact on Veteran satisfaction with the amount (time & tasks) they are completing in the VA mobile app.


### Outcome
This research will help us understand if/how the personalized app home screen design impacts the project’s [qualitative product success metrics](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/features/design-personalization/product/Personalized_homescreen-Product-Brief-2023.md#metrics) as well as identify opportunities to improve the usability and design of the personalized home screen in future iterations.

**Success measures:**
1. Veteran comprehension of what the app can do
    a. in general and
    b. for them in their current circumstances.
2. Veterans’ perceived current and future value of the app.


### Research questions
1. What do participants **believe that the VA mobile app *can do*** based on the contents of the personalized home screen?
    * in general?
    *  for them in their current circumstances?
2. Do participants **find value in the VA mobile app** in its current form based on the contents of the personalized home screen? 
3. Do participants **understand** what the modules on the home screen are and **find value in the high-level data** being displayed within the modules?
4. Do participants choose to use the home screen as a task starting point, and will they **successfully be able to begin some tasks** using the mobile app home screen?
5. **Is there a difference between screenreader users and non-screenreader users** in terms of perception of app capabilities, perception of value, and the usability of the personalized home screen?
6. **Do participants experience performance issues/lag** when loading the personalized home screen? If so, do performance issues impact participants’ perception of the app’s capabilities or value?


### Hypothesis
1. Upon seeing the personalized VA mobile app home screen, participants will **demonstrate that they understand** what the VA mobile app can do (help users keep up with and manage interactions across VA).
2. Participants will **be able to imagine and describe how the app will help** them with the tasks they currently use in the app and in their life.
3. Participants will **understand** that the personalized home screen modules contain high-level data from their in-flight tasks, and may describe it as being helpful in keeping up with their tasks.
4. Participants will **choose to use the personalized home screen modules** as a way to quickly answer questions/access in-flight tasks.
5. Screenreader users and non-screenreader users will **experience the same level of usability**, and use of assistive technology will not cause a difference in participant  perceptions of app capabilities or value.
6. Participants **may experience some lag** when the personalized home screen is loading data, but any lag will not affect their perception of the app’s capabilities or value. We believe that some users may choose an alternate way for accessing tasks if the lag is perceived to be too great.

## Methods + Tools  
### Evaluative Study (remote, moderated)

#### Method
* We want to conduct moderated, remote, think-aloud user interviews with usability testing using a pre-release build of the VA mobile app. The non-screenreader user interviews will be up to 60 minutes in length, and we expect the screenreader user interviews to be up to 120 minutes in length.  
* We will conduct the research in two blocks, for simpler analysis & less researcher context-switching: 
  * Screenreader users scheduled in a block (with a11y ride along support)
  * Non-screenreader users scheduled in a block
* As a part of the screening process, we will have Perigean:
  * Confirm that participants are iPhone or iPad users.
  * Confirm that participants have downloaded Zoom onto their mobile device (and can use it to screen share) before the research session.
  * Confirm that participants are willing and have room on their device to install two apps—Testflight and a pre-release build of the VA mobile app—on their mobile devices to use during the session (we will help them remove them). The Testflight app is 12.6 MB and the VA mobile app is 55 MB.
  * Provide users with a link to the Testflight app and confirm that participants have installed Testflight on their mobile device before the research session. 
  * Confirm that participants have VA login credentials that they can use to log out of & into the app on their own (a username and password, not biometrics).

## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach
We will recruit Veteran participants using a lean maximum variation strategy. We'll leverage Perigean's recruiting services to identify and schedule participants.


### Recruitment criteria
Recruit 18 Veterans for a minimum of 10 successfully completed sessions.

#### Primary criteria
* All participants must be iPhone or iPad users (Android will not work).
* All participants must be willing to do an activity from their iPhone or iPad device that requires tapping a link to install a special version of the VA Health and Benefits mobile app on their phone and sharing their screen via Zoom during the setup and activity.
* All participants must be able to independently log into the VA Health and Benefits mobile app using their VA login credentials.
  * Please confirm via phone follow-up that if the user were to get logged out of the app suddenly, they are able to log back in on their own using their credentials. 
* At least 9 participants should be active monthly users of the VA Health and Benefits mobile app.
  * An active monthly user is defined as a Veteran who accesses the app more than 1 time per month in order to review information or do a task.
    * Please do confirm via phone that the participant uses the VA Health and Benefits Mobile App
      * To confirm, ask them to tell you the version of the app that they have installed (Version number is located at the bottom of the app’s splash screen, the format is "#.#.#").
* All participants should have an active VA claim and/or appeal.
* At least 9 participants should be users of VA health care.
* At least 9 participants live in a rural area (seeing potential internet connectivity differences are important to the study)
