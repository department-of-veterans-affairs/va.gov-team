# Personalized Home Screen - Evaluative Research - MVP
Participant sessions were conducted June 2024  

Researcher: Holly Collier ([holly.collier@adhocteam.us](mailto:holly.collier@adhocteam.us)), VA Mobile UX Team

**Summary**  
The VA Flagship mobile app team believes that bringing personalized content to the VA mobile app’s home screen will help new and current app users keep up with and manage their interactions across VA and find value in the app that they aren’t discovering now. This particular study will help us examine if/how the personalized homescreen design impacts project success metrics and identify opportunities to improve it as part of the [VA Mobile App's Personalization efforts](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/va-mobile-app/features/design-personalization).

The purpose of this research is to:

* Understand if/how the personalized home screen design impacts participant comprehension of what the VA mobile app can do (in general, and for them specifically). (project success metric)
* Understand if/how the personalized home screen design impacts participant perception of the app’s current and future value. (project success metric)
* Evaluate the usability of the personalized home screen and category screens using high-level tasks that the participants will be asked to complete and determine if any significant usability barriers (including app performance) exist for participants who use the app with assistive technology vs without assistive technology.
* Pilot conducting remote, evaluative research using a live, pre-release build of the app on participants’ mobile devices (including with screenreader users), and improve the instructions and process for that in preparation for future usability studies.
