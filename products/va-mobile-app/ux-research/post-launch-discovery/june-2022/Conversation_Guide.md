## Introduction (5 minutes)

Thank you for joining us today! My name is Liz, and I also have two teammates (insert names) who are here to join us as silent observers. I’m here today to talk with you today about your experience using the VA Health and Benefits app. Our discussion will help the team understand how to improve the app for Veterans in the future.

Before we start, there are a few things I'd like to mention:



* We aren’t trying to sell or promote any product or service to you.
* There are no right or wrong answers. We just want to hear your opinions, so that we can improve the mobile app and meet the needs of Veterans like yourself.
* I won’t be offended by any opinions you express.
* There’s no expectation to provide any personal information around your health situation or medical diagnoses. Please feel free to share your thoughts and experiences at the level that’s comfortable for you.
* This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt us to move on to the next question.
* We’ll be talking about how you use your mobile phone today. Are you comfortable sharing how you use your phone with us? Because we might access the VA mobile app on your phone, this could use up some of your data. We can make sure you’re on the wifi network right now. The other option is to use one of the phones we have available with the app already installed on it. Let me know what you’d prefer to do.
* Is it ok if I record the audio of our session today? Our team will use this as backup in case we need to refer to something you said.
* **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. Any minutes you spend with us are valuable today. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop. Just let me know at any point if you’re uncomfortable continuing, and we will end.**

Does that all make sense, and sound okay to you?

Great! Any questions before we get started?

Ok, I'm going to hit the record button now. _Start recording._

I've begun the recording now. Is it ok by you if we continue to record?

## Section 3: VA Health and Benefits App Card Game (20 minutes)

Prompt: Think about your current interactions with the VA to manage your healthcare and benefits. Then, take a look at these cards. Pick out the 5 cards that are most important to you.

1. Communicate with my doctors
2. Share health info with people in my life
3. Get connected to other Veterans
4. Get connected to people who can support me
5. Get reminders for things
6. Access my lab and test results
7. Access my health records
8. Manage my prescriptions
9. Manage my VA letters
10. Provide feedback on health visits
11. Make my in-person visits easier
12. Manage my VA payments
13. Manage my VA debt and copay bills
14. Find out about other VA benefits I’m not using 
15. Write your own: blank
16. Write your own: blank

If there’s something that’s missing, please take one of the blank cards and write your own response on the card.

Now, arrange them in a row in order of importance to you, starting with the most important one.

Tell me more about the ones you chose - why did you choose these cards to begin with? 

Why did you arrange them in this order?


Now consider the reasons why you use the VA Health and Benefits app. Here are a few red stickers. Imagine you could bring some of these things into the app. Which of these areas would you want to see in the app?  Place a red circle on those areas._

Tell me more about your choices. Why did you pick these items? 


Why would you want to access these areas in the app instead of online (like VA.gov) or in person?


## Thank-You and Closing (5 minutes)

* What were your overall thoughts on what we discussed today?

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the app and make sure it really works for Veterans.


Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day.
