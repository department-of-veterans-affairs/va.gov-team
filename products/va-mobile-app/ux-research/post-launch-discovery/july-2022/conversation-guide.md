## VA Mobile App Discovery 


## **Conversation Guide**

Part II Remote: August 2022


### Before the interview starts: validate the participant uses the VA Health and Benefits app and get permission for observers to join.

_When the participant joins:_

Thanks so much for joining today. My name is Liz, very nice to meet you. I’m here today to talk with you today about your experience using the VA Health and Benefits app. Our discussion will help the team understand how to improve the app for Veterans in the future. Before we begin I wanted to confirm that you use the VA Health and Benefits mobile app? Could you get your phone out and describe the app to me? 

_If the participant does not use the mobile app:_

Today’s discussion was about your experience using the app. Since you currently aren’t using it, we can end here for today. I appreciate your time, and apologize for the early end to the session. I’ll reach out to our scheduling partners to have them follow up with you.

_If the participant uses the mobile app:_

Great, let’s continue on. Could you take a second to make sure you’re logged into the app? \
I have a few people on the team who are interested in listening in to our session as observers. They’re in the virtual waiting room right now. It’s completely fine if you choose to have the session without observers, so let me know what you’d prefer. If it’s ok by you, I’ll have them join. 

_(If the participant agrees, let observers join with their video on. Each observer can come off mute and introduce themselves, and then go back on mute with video off._


## Introduction (5 minutes)

There are a few things I'd like to mention:



* There are no right or wrong answers, and I won’t be offended by any opinions you express. We just want to hear your opinions, so that we can improve the mobile app and make it work better for everyone.
* There’s no expectation to provide any personal information around your health situation or medical diagnoses. Please feel free to share your thoughts and experiences at the level that’s comfortable for you.
* This entire session should take about 60 minutes. 
* We’ll talk together in the beginning, and then we will move to a part where I’ll ask you to share your phone screen and VA app with us. 
* Are you comfortable sharing your phone screen as well as the VA health and benefits app with us? Because we will access the VA mobile app on your phone, we will see your information in the app. Is this ok by you?
* Finally, is it ok if I record the audio of our session today? Our team will use this as backup in case we need to refer to something you said. The recordings will be destroyed after.
* **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. Any minutes you spend with us are valuable today. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop. Just let me know at any point if you’re uncomfortable continuing, and we will end.**

Does that all make sense, and sound okay to you?

Great! Any questions before we continue?

Ok, I'm going to hit the record button now. _Start recording._

Is it ok if we record this session?


## Section 1: Warm-Up Questions (5 minutes)



* For Health and Benefits, what are the main things you use the VA for right now?
* What other VA apps or websites do you use? 
    * Which ones do you use on a regular basis?
    * What do you use them for?
* When you have questions related to the VA, what places or people do you go to in order to get a question answered or find out more information?  

## Section 2: Current App Experience (20 minutes)

Let’s talk a little bit about your phone now.



* What type of phone do you have? 
* What are some of the apps you use the most?
    * How do you organize the apps on your phone? 
    * What are your go-to apps for managing your overall health and benefits? 

Current VA Mobile App Experience



* Think back to the last time you accessed the VA Health and Benefits app: what did you use it for?
* Do you remember how you heard about the VA Health and Benefits app?
* What motivated you to download the app in the first place? 
* About how often do you use the app? Weekly? Monthly?

At this point, I’d like to ask you to share your phone screen so we can look at the app together and you can give me a tour of how you use it. I can walk you through how to screen share.

* Do you ever need or want to share health-related info from the app with anyone else in your life?
* What are your favorite parts of the app?
* What pain points do you run into?
* If you could change anything about the app, what would it be?

Trust



* When you think about this app, how would you describe your trust level using it? What comes to mind?
    * (if relevant) What are things that help you trust it? 
    * (if relevant) What are things that undermine your trust in it?

Personalization



* How would you describe the information you see in the app right now? Does it come across as customized information or more general. What comes to mind?


## Section 3: VA Health and Benefits Card Game (20 minutes)

Now, think about your current interactions with the VA to manage your healthcare and benefits and how you use the VA health and benefits app to help you do this. 

I’m going to share my screen with you in a second. On the screen you’ll see a list of things. Some of these things you can do in the app right now, others you can’t. I’ll read this list aloud to you. As I’m reading, think of the top 5 on this list that are most important to you, personally.



1. Communicate with my doctors
2. Share health info with people in my life
3. Get connected to other Veterans
4. Get connected to people who can support me
5. Get reminders for things
6. Access my lab and test results
7. Access my health records
8. Manage my prescriptions
9. Manage my VA letters
10. Make my in-person visits easier
11. Manage my VA debt or payments
12. Find out about other VA benefits I’m not using 

Now, pick out the 5 cards that are most important to you. Tell me which 5 cards to move to the top of the screen.

If you had to arrange the 5 cards in order of things that are most important to you right now, how would you arrange them? Go ahead and tell me, and I’ll put them in order of most important.

Tell me more about your choices. Why did you pick these items?_ \
