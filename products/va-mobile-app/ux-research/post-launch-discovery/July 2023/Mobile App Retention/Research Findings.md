## **Background**


### 
One of the 10 primary OCTO goals is expanding the flagship mobile app. However, a key part of achieving this goal is the ability to retain current app users as we grow. 


### 
Quantitative data analysis conducted in May 2023 revealed the flagship mobile app loses about 60% of its users after the first month. We want to understand why this dropoff is happening, and what we can do to improve these rates in order to retain a greater percentage of Veterans who download the app. (For more information, check out this [retention dashboard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16kMmtDDMDMw63UDvBavnmIRzlgooFP4WKhXV03bnbWY/edit#gid=394478712).)


### 
Retaining our current users is a key part of our expansion strategy. Understanding why users drop off will help us determine ways we can improve our unauthenticated experience, as well as help us prioritize future areas in our roadmap based on the things users thought they could do when they first downloaded the app.


### **OCTO Priorities** 
This research supports OCTO priority #4: expand the flagship mobile app.

### **Veteran Journey**


### 
This research connects to the following key stages on the Veteran Journey: Starting up, taking care of myself, putting down roots, reinventing myself, retiring, aging. 
 
### **Problem Statement** 
 
A significant portion of mobile app users are lost before ever logging-in, and a significant portion of users who log-in during the month they first open the app drop off over the following month, and we are not clear why this is happening.

### **Research Goals**

* Explore the motivations Veterans have for downloading the app, and what happens for them after they log into the app. Did they find what they were looking for, or did they have issues?
* Identify the reasons why Veterans stop using the app.
* Identify areas of value which might persuade Veterans to continue using the app.

### **Research Questions**


We have a limited understanding of the reasons why veterans why approximately 60% of flagship mobile app users stop using the app in the month following their initial download. The focus of this research effort will be tightly focused on understanding why Veterans stop using the app.



1. What was your motivation for downloading the mobile app? 
2. What are the main things you wanted to be able to do after you downloaded the app?
3. What difficulty do you experience with logging into the mobile app, if at all?
4. When did you stop using the mobile app? Why?
5. What were the specific reasons you stopped using the app?
6. What are things you’d need to have in order to start using the app again, if any?


## **Methodology**


### Data Collection

Prior to interviews with Veterans, we reviewed mobile app data to identify the rates of retention for mobile app users who downloaded the app. We specifically focused on app usage in the month following their initial download, as well as the 6 months following their initial download. 

Then, we conducted remote interviews with Veterans over zoom to identify some of the reasons and context behind the retention dropoff rates. These interviews included questions about their motivations for downloading the app, how they used it, any issues they faced, and reasons why they stopped using or paused using it for periods of time.


### Data analysis

After we completed Veteran interviews, we used the interview transcripts, observer notes captured in a mural board, and a high level summary sheet to analyze our findings and arrive at our conclusions. 

### **Hypotheses and Conclusions**



* Veterans are unsure of what they can do using the flagship mobile app.

_True. Veterans had varying degrees of understanding as far as what they could use the app for._



* Veterans download the health and benefits app expecting to be able to do something specific that’s not available, and then stop using it as a result.

_False. Although some Veterans expected to use the app for features that were not available, there was no indication they stopped using it as a result._



* Login is a high barrier to using the app. After downloading the app, Veterans navigate away, and don't remember to come back and log in until they need a certain service but remain blocked by the initial login problem.

_True. Veterans specifically described login challenges as one of the main reasons why they stopped using the app._



* Claims driven users have different engagement levels than health driven users, and their engagement with the mobile app is bumpier based on their experience with the claims process. 

_Partly True. Veterans with active claims specifically mentioned using the app as a way to check on their claims status. However, it’s unclear how this behavior unfolds over time._


## **Key Findings**

**1. Login posed a significant pain point for 8 out of the 17 Veterans we talked to.** Five of the Veteran participants specifically mentioned login as one of the reasons why they stopped using the app.

**2. Veteran expectations of what they thought they could do in the app was often inaccurate.** Some Veterans conflated the flagship app’s features with other features available in VA.gov or MyHealtheVet. 

**3. Veterans engaged with the Health and Benefits mobile app at intermittent times.** There’s not always a clear “stopping” point, especially if they used the app for the thing they wanted it for. 


## **Detailed Findings**

**1. Login posed a significant pain point for 8 out of the 17 Veterans we talked to.** Five of the Veteran participants specifically mentioned login as one of the reasons why they stopped using the app.

Of the 5 Veterans who stopped using the flagship mobile app, 2 used MHV login credentials, 1 used ID.me, and 2 did not know which login credential they tried to use. As a result of these login challenges:

* 2 Veterans eventually gave up
* 1 Veteran went in person to a nearby VAMC to get help and managed to get logged in
* 1 Veteran resorted to using MyHealtheVet on their computer
* 1 Veteran deleted the app and reinstalled it a few months later

_“The last few times I tried to log in, I couldn’t. It was not working. I hit the sign-in and when it wants to know my user ID and password, that’s when I get into trouble and finally give up. - Participant 13_

_“Now, I put user ID and when I hit go, all it does is the color goes green and if I use the down arrow, this field is required comes up and the keyboard comes up but I can’t see the block to type but I type anyway. So, when I type it in and hit go it takes me back to the sign-in screen. That’s where my frustration creeps up and I just go back to my computer.” - Participant 4_

_“Sometimes after 9pm or 10pm, you can't go in the app. I did it again later and the same thing. I thought it was maintenance.” - Participant 17_

**2. Veteran expectations of what they could do in the app was often inaccurate.** Some Veterans conflated the app’s features with other features available in VA.gov or MyHealtheVet. 

* About half of the Veterans (n=10) we talked to expected to use the app for features that the app doesn’t have, such as:
    * File a new claim (n=3)
    * Check medical records or tests (n=3)
    * Schedule new appointments (n=3)
    * Find new VA providers (n=1)
* 8 Veterans expected to use the app for features it currently has, but did not use the app for other features they were authorized to use
*  5 Veterans were curious and downloaded the app without a specific feature in mind, but to see if it would help make things faster or easier with VA

    _“...especially for someone who is busy, I don’t have time to sit there and go through the functionality.” - Participant 19_


    “ _I keep almost everything on my phone, I wanted to [use the app to] start a new claim.” - Participant 14 (currently experiencing housing insecurity)_


**3. Veterans engaged with the Health and Benefits mobile app at intermittent times.** There’s not always a clear “stopping” point, especially if they used the app for the thing they wanted it for. 

_“Once I used it for that [checking my claim], nothing of great importance has come up to make me think I should use the app for this. I'm probably not even fully aware of everything it does."  - Participant 19_
 
* Some Veterans came back to the mobile app when their life or health circumstances changed.

_“I go into the app about two times per month, it varies based on my health condition at the time.” - Participant 14_

_“I deleted it [the app] because I forgot my password. And I re-added it because I needed to add my step-children and I’m always on the go. I re-added the app in March….I log in multiple times a day to check in to see what’s happening, what’s changed.” - Participant 12_


## **Additional Insights**

The flagship mobile app was one digital tool Veterans tried to use to manage through instability, transitions and crisis. This included:


* Moving to a new state
* Experiencing a health crisis
* Experiencing housing instability

**Participant #2 - experiencing a health crisis, moving to a new state**

A few months ago, this Veteran shared she had learned about the flagship mobile app when she was in the Emergency Room. She had been self-harming, and was in crisis when she found out about the app from an ER nurse who was also a Veteran herself. The ER nurse thought it might help her with refilling her medications. This Veteran was also in a domestic violence situation at the time. She had reached out to a VSO to help her with a move, and decided she was going to move to Alaska or North Carolina.  
 
She began to see information for the Alaska VAMC in her mobile app, but this information was confusing to her as she had decided to move to North Carolina. 

She had the expectation that changing her address in the flagship mobile app would get her set up with a new VAMC in her new state. She didn’t realize she had to do a lot more to in-process at the new VAMC.

**Participant #12 - experienced housing insecurity**

This Veteran learned about the flagship mobile app from a VA advertisement about a year ago. She wanted to be able to use the app to look for new VA providers and departments, like audiology, and to be able to start a new claim, because she has a lot of documentation on her phone - she keeps everything on her phone. She had a social worker through CRRC, Community Resource and Referral Centers, a VA partner. She mentioned that she gets her prescriptions through the VA but makes sure she has them set up for in-person pickup and not mail order, because they can get stolen. She wanted to see resources available in the app for homeless veterans, and requested “have resources available at the Vets fingertips instead of having to dig on the website.” 

## **Takeaways**



1. Login **is** a problem, but information can help Veterans persist, specifically info on what’s new and what’s newly applicable to them and their needs
    * Information is shared by the app but **requires the Veteran to be logged in.** 
    * Information isn’t personal or dynamically responsive to Veterans’ life changes.
2. Research discovered important **new proto user segments**–specific-task and general VA relationship management. We can’t tell them apart in the current app data.
3. Veterans **re-evaluate the app’s value as their life changes** and based on what they know about the app at those times of change.
    * The app does not anticipate life changes from contextual data
    * The app does not specifically facilitate the user’s re-evaluation

## **Recommendations and Next Steps**


Findings will be incorporated into future plans for the mobile app from a variety of angles:



* New features & improvements to existing features. Potential ideas include:
    * Exploring onboarding options prior to log-in
* Identifying areas for additional research and quantitative analysis 
    * Defining user proto-segments

## **Further Research Needed**


The team will consider ways to explore the value the mobile app might have in helping Veterans navigate personal or health crises, as well as aiding in transitions.
