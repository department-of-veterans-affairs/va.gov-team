**Warm Up Questions - 5 min**

The following questions are a way to get to know you better and to make sure we are talking to veterans in different situations with different needs. Feel free to answer the questions you’re comfortable with, and please know you can skip anything you prefer not to answer.

* Tell me a little bit about yourself. Where are you from, where do you live now? From Colorado. I am now in Washington and been here a little over 3 years. 
* How long have you been out of the military? 2014.

    * About how long have you been connected to VA services?

**Experience with VA Health & Benefits Mobile App - 20 min**
Now we’re going to talk a bit about your experience using VA’s Health & Benefits mobile app. Again, please know you can skip anything you prefer not to answer, or to stop at any time.

* When did you first download the VA Health & Benefits app? Maybe last year. 
Probably email. 
* Do you use your fingerprint or face ID to get into the app? No. ID Me to log in. 
* What was your main reason(s) for downloading the mobile app? I was filing for an increase in my disability. So, there was a lot of having to go on and check things. 
* What are the things you wanted to be able to do after you downloaded it? Accomplish tasks, VA related tasks. When you call the VA, the wait times are not great. I don’t have time to sit on hold. A lot of times, you wait and then they transfer you and a lot of bouncing you around. It’s very frustrating. 
* What difficulty do you experience with logging into the mobile app, if at all? Maybe initially going through the verification process, taking a bit of time. But once I got it set up it wasn’t set up. 
* When did you stop using the mobile app? 
* What were the specific reasons you stopped using the app? 
* What are things you’d need to have in order to start using the app again, if any? 
* What other information is important for us to know that we haven’t talked about?
*How often where you checking your claim? Once or twice a month. 
*How would you like to be notified and why? Email. Or even text. 
Because I use it consistently, every day. I always have my phone nearby. I’m always checking my email.
