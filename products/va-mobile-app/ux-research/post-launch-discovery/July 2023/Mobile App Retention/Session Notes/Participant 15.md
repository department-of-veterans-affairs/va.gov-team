**Experience with VA Health & Benefits Mobile App - 20 min**
Now we’re going to talk a bit about your experience using VA’s Health & Benefits mobile app. Again, please know you can skip anything you prefer not to answer, or to stop at any time.

* When did you first download the VA Health & Benefits app? Probably a year ago. After one of your sessions, we went through the app. 
*How often do you use the app? Pretty often. The verification process gets hectic, where you have to get a code. 
* Do you use your fingerprint or face ID to get into the app? I use my healthy vet log-in. No problem. 
* Last time you used the app? To check my appointments last week and very that my address was correct. 
*Do you fill your prescriptions on the app? Yes, I do that. Pretty much every 3-4 months. 
* What was your main reason(s) for downloading the mobile app? 
* What are the things you wanted to be able to do after you downloaded it?
* What difficulty do you experience with logging into the mobile app, if at all?
* When did you stop using the mobile app? 
* What were the specific reasons you stopped using the app?
* What are things you’d need to have in order to start using the app again, if any?
* Last time I was on VA.gov? No, I can't remember what I was looking for. Maybe VA forms. 
* Other VA app that you like to use? The app where you can download your forms and VA records that show your medical disability- VA letters. 
*Any issues using the screen reader? I haven’t really run into any. You just have to remember to look at the whole page because not every little button will show up when using the screen reader. What would be helpful if at the top you have a plus or minus to increase or decrease the size (font). That would be helpful if you get stuck.
* What other information is important for us to know that we haven’t talked about? The authentication part, where you pull up your text message and then go back to the actual page and if the person hasn’t cleared up other apps, you get lost. 

* How often do you use your screen reader? On my iPad, I enlarge and have text as high as it can go. On my phone, I have it about halfway magnification. Voice over you know sometimes there's no problem until you swipe to look for what you're looking for.

**Thank-You and Closing - 5 min**


Is there anything else you wanted to share before we wrap up? 
I think the app is fine, just the accessibility issue.
