**Warm Up Questions - 5 min**

The following questions are a way to get to know you better and to make sure we are talking to veterans in different situations with different needs. Feel free to answer the questions you’re comfortable with, and please know you can skip anything you prefer not to answer.

* Tell me a little bit about yourself. Where are you from, where do you live now? Wyoming, 50 miles of Yellowstone Park.
* How long have you been out of the military? 2008
* Do you ever use any type of assistive technology, like enlarging the text on your phone or using a screen reader? I increased the font size. 
With the app, font size is okay. I don’t use dark or light mode. 
* What type of phone do you have? Samsung.
 
* What was your first connection with the VA? 1984-85. I thought I broke my ankle. 
    * About how long have you been connected to VA services?
    * How long have you been out of the military before you first connected with the VA?
* Do you receive healthcare through the VA?
    * If yes: What VAMC do you go to regularly? Sheridan VA, a 3-hour drive over the mountain. 
Community Care is what I prefer. I have two doctors in Billings, Montana. 
    * How far away is it from you?
    * Do you also use the VA for prescriptions? Yes. 
I have not refilled prescriptions on the app. 
* Do you have a disability rating right now? 100%.
    * If yes: Do you receive disability payments from the VA? Yes.
* Do you have any active claims or appeals with the VA? No. 
* Are there any other benefits you use VA for? Both education and GI bill. My house is with the VA loan. I find out of benefits through the VA or emails.

**Experience with VA Health & Benefits Mobile App - 20 min**
Now we’re going to talk a bit about your experience using VA’s Health & Benefits mobile app. Again, please know you can skip anything you prefer not to answer, or to stop at any time.

* When did you first download the VA Health & Benefits app? A couple of years back. 
Through the Military.com website or Travel claims online. 
* Do you use your fingerprint or face ID to get into the app? ID Me, then I get a text, then I have to go back. It’s frustrating. I don’t like thumb log-in because I never put my thumb in the right spot. 
*Do you use the app for appointments? Usually not because it's in my Healthy Vet or on my phone. 
* What was your main reason(s) for downloading the mobile app? To see what was available. 
* What are the things you wanted to be able to do after you downloaded it?
* What difficulty do you experience with logging into the mobile app, if at all? I don’t like to log in on VA.gov. 
* When did you stop using the mobile app? 
* What were the specific reasons you stopped using the app? Probably yes. Just because I forget about it and I have my laptop. 
* What are things you’d need to have in order to start using the app again, if any?
* What other information is important for us to know that we haven’t talked about? The print option on the app would be helpful. 
*When did you last login? This morning. I can't log in with my healthy vet because it has the wrong email. I don’t know how it got that email. 
*How often do you log in and for what? A dozen times or so. I used it for appointments, that kind of thing. I don’t need the letters anymore. I do my prescriptions through my laptop on My Healthy Vet.

**Thank-You and Closing - 5 min**


Is there anything else you wanted to share before we wrap up? A lot of these older Veterans don’t do computers and a lot of them are on the phone, but they give up.  
If I had just the phone and not the computer- change the login. Don’t give 3-4 options to log in, to make it more accessible. 
Print option (to be able to print from the app).
