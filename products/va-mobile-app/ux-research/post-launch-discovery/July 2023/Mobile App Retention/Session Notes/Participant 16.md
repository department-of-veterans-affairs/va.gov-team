**Warm Up Questions - 5 min**

The following questions are a way to get to know you better and to make sure we are talking to veterans in different situations with different needs. Feel free to answer the questions you’re comfortable with, and please know you can skip anything you prefer not to answer.

* Tell me a little bit about yourself. Where are you from, where do you live now? Oregon. I transferred with my job. I work in the release of information department in a hospital.
* How long have you been out of the military? 10 years.
* Do you ever use any type of assistive technology, like enlarging the text on your phone or using a screen reader? No. 
* What type of phone do you have? Android.  	

* What was your first connection with the VA? Education benefits. Used it to get my bachelor's degree. Immediately used the benefits. 2017 I got my bachelor's degree. 
    * About how long have you been connected to VA services?
    * How long have you been out of the military before you first connected with the VA?
* Do you receive healthcare through the VA?
    * If yes: What VAMC do you go to regularly? 
    * How far away is it from you?
    * Do you also use the VA for prescriptions?
* Do you have a disability rating right now? 70%. 
Attempted to get it in 2018. Went through the DAV and the VA lost my claim. This time around with the app, tracking my claim it was a lot better. 
    * If yes: Do you receive disability payments from the VA?
* Do you have any active claims or appeals with the VA? No. 
* Are there any other benefits you use VA for? I don’t use the VA for my healthcare. 
I just bought a house. I used my VA home loan. I just bought a house. Got the keys today. 
I've gotten VA disability.  
I went through my realtor. Found a lender (also a Vet). They did my VA loan. That process was not that bad.

**Experience with VA Health & Benefits Mobile App - 20 min**
Now we’re going to talk a bit about your experience using VA’s Health & Benefits mobile app. Again, please know you can skip anything you prefer not to answer, or to stop at any time.

* When did you first download the VA Health & Benefits app? A few years ago. The VA app was something that- I always seemed to have it even though I don’t use it often. 
* Do you use your fingerprint or face ID to get into the app?  I can’t remember but I can attempt to do it now. 
I log in via ID Me. With the app and website. No issues. 
* What was your main reason(s) for downloading the mobile app? Because I was interested in VA services. I would also go to the VA website (VA.gov). 
Right before I got my disability percentage, there was nothing on the App. This was right before I got my rating. I applied in December and got my rating in May of this year. 
* What are the things you wanted to be able to do after you downloaded it? I was expecting to say, preparing to notify a) you're about to know what your rating is. But it wasn’t for that long that I didn’t have to reach out to the VA. 
*Regarding your claim, what would like to see? If I could change it, instead of- if there was something that said what it was doing, in our end, it doesn’t look like we have lost your claim. Yes, some reassurance. Yes, I was using the app. 
* Last time you looked at the app? Right after getting my disability, just to look at it (claim). 

* What difficulty do you experience with logging into the mobile app, if at all?
* When did you stop using the mobile app? 
* What were the specific reasons you stopped using the app?
* What are things you’d need to have in order to start using the app again, if any?
* What other information is important for us to know that we haven’t talked about?
*Do you have any new ideas for the app? I don’t know how to answer that question because I don’t use it that often. But let me log in and see…I like the letters and documents that you can see them all in the app. I used it to view whatever letters came from the VA. 
The app shows payment history and if there was anything wrong, I would have looked at the app. 
*Any other alert to indicate a change? An alert would be nice if something changes with the claim. Even a pop-up notification would be awesome.
