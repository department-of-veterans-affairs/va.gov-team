**Warm Up Questions - 5 min**

The following questions are a way to get to know you better and to make sure we are talking to veterans in different situations with different needs. Feel free to answer the questions you’re comfortable with, and please know you can skip anything you prefer not to answer.

* Tell me a little bit about yourself. Where are you from, where do you live now? I am an Army Veteran and live in Wisconsin. 
* How long have you been out of the military? Since 2008.
* Do you ever use any type of assistive technology, like enlarging the text on your phone or using a screen reader?  Not usually.
* What type of phone do you have? Android, Samsung.

* What was your first connection with the VA?
    * About how long have you been connected to VA services? For everything, I’m 80% service connected. 
    * How long have you been out of the military before you first connected with the VA?
* Do you receive healthcare through the VA?
    * If yes: What VAMC do you go to regularly? 1 ½ hour away from my VA. 
Every 6 months for preventative maintenance stuff. 
    * How far away is it from you?
    * Do you also use the VA for prescriptions? Yes
* Do you have a disability rating right now?
    * If yes: Do you receive disability payments from the VA?
* Do you have any active claims or appeals with the VA? I have a pending claim that has been sitting for 3 years. 
I’m trying to get a hold of my rep, but he just tells me it’s still sitting. 
*What would be helpful to see on the app regarding your appeal? To tell me a rough estimate of the waiting period. Having an idea that they are working on it. The emails are not consistent. 
* Are there any other benefits you use VA for?

## 
**Experience with VA Health & Benefits Mobile App - 20 min**
Now we’re going to talk a bit about your experience using VA’s Health & Benefits mobile app. Again, please know you can skip anything you prefer not to answer, or to stop at any time.

* When did you first download the VA Health & Benefits app? Probably a year ago. 
I hate using my cell phone because I like a bigger screen. 
*How did you hear about the app? I remember seeing a Facebook post on a veteran’s group. 
* Last time used app? Just used it last week to refill my meds. 
* Do you use your fingerprint or face ID to get into the app? My healthy Vet log-in is what I usually use. It usually works and logs me in where I need to be. 
*What motivated you to download it? Because we were out and about, and I knew I needed to check my appointment. 
* What was your main reason(s) for downloading the mobile app? 
* What are the things you wanted to be able to do after you downloaded it?
* What difficulty do you experience with logging into the mobile app, if at all?
* When did you stop using the mobile app? 
* What were the specific reasons you stopped using the app?
* What are things you’d need to have in order to start using the app again, if any?
* What other information is important for us to know that we haven’t talked about? Community care because of how far I am from Madison. Having access to the community care letters in case they need to check something- authorization to be able to use it, would be helpful. 
* Last time you used it for? Checking appointments and checking meds. 
*What do you like about the app?  You don’t have to click everywhere. 
*How often do you log in? As needed. At least once a month. 
* Have you digitally checked in to an appointment? I have not, our hospital doesn’t have that. 
*What was the stressful experience? Having to remember all my logins and try to figure out where all my letters are.

**Thank-You and Closing - 5 min**


Is there anything else you wanted to share before we wrap up? 
If you can log in with my Healthy vet, it would be okay. 
I would add any known allergies on the app.
