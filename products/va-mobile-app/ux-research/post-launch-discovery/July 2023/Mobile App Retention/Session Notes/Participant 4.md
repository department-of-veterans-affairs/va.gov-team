**Experience with VA Health & Benefits Mobile App - 20 min**
Now we’re going to talk a bit about your experience using VA’s Health & Benefits mobile app. Again, please know you can skip anything you prefer not to answer, or to stop at any time.

* When did you first download the VA Health & Benefits app? This past year.
* Do you use your fingerprint or face ID to get into the app? I did a fallback with my Healthy Vet log-in. Within the last year was changing the way we logged in. DSV, ID me, All that stuff was confusing.
* What was your main reason(s) for downloading the mobile app? My history. Started with my back issue and In 2019 had a cardiac problem. For me I was using Healthy Vet with communicating with people with that kind of history, it would be nice to check and see if messages were there. 
* What are the things you wanted to be able to do after you downloaded it? I expected pharmacy and speaking with my doctors.
* What difficulty do you experience with logging into the mobile app, if at all? Been more complex with being able to log in. I tried to put it in my user id and nothing happened.  
* When did you stop using the mobile app? 
* What were the specific reasons you stopped using the app? Right now I’m on my computer with my mouse and on my phone I’m limited visibility. 
* What are things you’d need to have in order to start using the app again, if any?
* What other information is important for us to know that we haven’t talked about? I would want it to be a mirror of the computer application. I like that it’s easier to use and I can see everything on the computer. 
*If you get stuck how do you get assistance to get in and out of the app? I get frustrated and realize it will take a lot more time. Now, I put user ID and when I hit go, all it does is the color goes green and if I use the down arrow, this field is required comes up and the keyboard comes up but I can’t see the block to type but I type anyway. So, when I type it in and hit go it gives me back to the sign-in screen. That’s where my frustration creeps up and I just go back to my computer. 
*Have you successfully logged in the app? Go back and hit the down arrow and I see the cursor flashing and I hit the box and enter the password and put the at in the keyboard. I’m going to hit go, so then, what happens it asks me if I wanted to save the password. If I hit save it goes to my Samsung account. It’s basically having me go back to the Microsoft stuff of sign-in. 
*Now that you’re in the app? Tell me about the app and hoping to use it for? I can look at anything, past records, appointments, messages, and can see prescriptions I’m on and I can see new prescriptions. I can also see if a prescription is due to be renewed and or needs refills. I can see my vaccines.
What I normally do, I go to the health and look at the health, vaccines, 
*Last time used app? Probably did it yesterday just to check on the frustration part. Now, when I do that, it says I have a message and I see that at 10:10 this morning. I want to be able to log in if im out and about, I want to be able to log in. But you saw firsthand my frustration to be able to log in.

**Thank-You and Closing - 5 min**


Is there anything else you wanted to share before we wrap up? 
I do not . I’m very comfortable with a computer and went to the mobile app and it was a 180 when using the mobile app.
