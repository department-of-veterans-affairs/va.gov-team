**Warm Up Questions - 5 min**

The following questions are a way to get to know you better and to make sure we are talking to veterans in different situations with different needs. Feel free to answer the questions you’re comfortable with, and please know you can skip anything you prefer not to answer.

* Tell me a little bit about yourself. Where are you from, where do you live now? From Maryland and now in Texas, I was in the army, and I’m a VA user on the app and I like it.  I live in Fort Cavazo, 40 mins from Austin. I have lived here since 2011 on and off. 
* How long have you been out of the military? Since 2017. 
* Do you ever use any type of assistive technology, like enlarging the text on your phone or using a screen reader? 
* What type of phone do you have? iPhone

* What was your first connection with the VA?
    * About how long have you been connected to VA services? About as long as I’ve been there for about 5 years, just about. 
    * How long have you been out of the military before you first connected with the VA? To start my benefits and disability benefits, and actively once I started going to the hospital. That was about 3 years ago. Recently, I found the mobile app and made it easier instead of logging into a computer. 
* Do you receive healthcare through the VA?
    * If yes: What VAMC do you go to regularly? Temple VA- 20 minutes from where I live. 
    * How far away is it from you? takes me 20-30 minutes to get there, depending on traffic.
    * Do you also use the VA for prescriptions? Yes. I was asked the medications I was still on, and it makes it easier to pull them up in the app when the doctor or nurse asked. You see what’s active, and what needs a refill, and I can see active refill active in the process.
* Do you have a disability rating right now? yes
    * If yes: Do you receive disability payments from the VA?
* Do you have any active claims or appeals with the VA? Yes- consisting of multiple things. A couple of combined injuries. Active claims, - none of them are active. I did have to do appeals, but I didn’t get approved for 2-3 processes. It was easy to appeal and submit the process. It was lengthy but not too hard. One thing I forgot, when I had an active claim, I checked to see if it went through. I felt like it was a lot quicker by looking on app then on the computer.
* Are there any other benefits you use VA for?

**Experience with VA Health & Benefits Mobile App - 20 min**
Now we’re going to talk a bit about your experience using VA’s Health & Benefits mobile app. Again, please know you can skip anything you prefer not to answer, or to stop at any time.

* When did you first download the VA Health & Benefits app? I was a couple of years ago. It didn’t have all these features, but I love it now. I can see my medication list. I like that I don’t need to get on a computer to see my letters. Everything is in the palm of your hand. The access of payment history made it easier. It’s cleaner and faster than what it was. 
* Do you use your fingerprint or face ID to get into the app? I’m already logged in, I have an iPhone and use facial recognition and it will sign me in. Once in a while, I have to do my ID with a special sign-in ID me is the main login option or facial recognition I use. ID Me is less of a headache.
* What was your main reason(s) for downloading the mobile app? It was just the letters that I would get in the mail and phone calls and drive over here and when I did get a phone call, and called the VA, I felt like a hot potato because I didn’t know what they would ask for. I use VA for regular checkups and medications. 
* How often do you look at the mobile app? 3-4 times a week, I’m obsessive like that, just to make sure I don’t miss an appointment. 
* Last time used app? I last used to to play around with it. The purpose was last week because I thought I had an appointment. I didn’t have an appointment and I would have shown up for no reason. I was going to show up for something I didn’t have. The app is quicker. And doing the two factor.
* What are the things you wanted to be able to do after you downloaded it? I started using it a lot more now. When I saw that it was updated, I started using it. The emails is how I found out about the update. I don’t remember if it’s VA news, must have been this. That email specific is when I saw new updates and I played with the app since I had it already downloaded. It didn’t have the Army logo before as a home page. Being able to see VA letters and documents was big and doing everything that you couldn’t do before. You couldn’t send your provider a message from the older app. I sent messages to my provider in Feb because, I had an issue with my referral, and outside of the office I messaged the doctor from my phone through the app which was nice, or else I’d have to wait. Then I pull my prescriptions, My appointments and I view my payment history. Those are features essential, and I really like it. 
*Is there any other website you use? My health . va.gov website
* What difficulty do you experience with logging into the mobile app, if at all?
* When did you stop using the mobile app? 
* What were the specific reasons you stopped using the app?
* What are things you’d need to have in order to start using the app again, if any? I don’t think I want anything different on the app because it has all the review letters, claims, and pending claims, it does have appointments, messages, and vaccinations, and even has covid updates and payment history. 
* What other information is important for us to know that we haven’t talked about? If you need bloodwork information- sometimes I do need my bloodwork or medical info I can’t see it on the app only on the computer.
*What you’d like to see on the app? I don’t think I want anything on the app because it has all the review letters, claims, and pending claims, it does have appointments, messages, and vaccinations, and even has covid updates and payment history and if you need bloodwork information. Sometimes I do need my bloodwork or medical info I cant see it on the app only on the computer.  I would want to see my cholesterol levels, my iron, all the little levels of high and low, basic things. That would be the only thing.
