**Experience with VA Health & Benefits Mobile App - 20 min**
Now we’re going to talk a bit about your experience using VA’s Health & Benefits mobile app. Again, please know you can skip anything you prefer not to answer, or to stop at any time.

* When did you first download the VA Health & Benefits app? I think it was 2021 or 2022. The VA sends emails and they were talking about the app, that’s how I downloaded it. 
* Do you use your fingerprint or face ID to get into the app? DS log on. Because when I use my Healthy Vet it doesn’t go through. It kicks me out. 
* What was your main reason(s) for downloading the mobile app? I thought I could schedule my appointments and talk to my doctors. 
I thought I could schedule my appointments. 
* What are the things you wanted to be able to do after you downloaded it? 
* What difficulty do you experience with logging into the mobile app, if at all? Sometimes after 9pm or 10pm, you can't go in the app. 
I did it again later and the same thing.  I thought it was maintenance. 
* When did you stop using the mobile app? Yes, for that time that I couldn’t log in at night, I got annoyed. It’s not working so, I wasn’t going to use it. I went to the website. 
*How often do you use the app? I used it to change my address. It was successful. 
Not a lot. 
* What were the specific reasons you stopped using the app?
* What are things you’d need to have in order to start using the app again, if any? To fix it at night. 

* What other information is important for us to know that we haven’t talked about? 
*How would you like to get notifications? Email.
For the prescriptions- you can't ask the app, you have to go through my healthy vet. You can't order/ request a refill. 
I use My Healthy Vet to do the refills. 
*Transfer process? A social worker in Massachusetts did my paperwork to come here and had to contact the VA here and he told her that I had to go to the main VA. 
*How do you contact your social worker? Through text. (Handing me off to a new social worker in NC).
