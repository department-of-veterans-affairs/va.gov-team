# Comparative Analysis: Navigation

August 17, 2020

# Background and goals
In addition to a [comparative audit](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-research/comparative-feature-analysis/summary.md) of all feature types the MVP will include, we looked in more detail at navigation. The goal of doing this was to better understand mobile navigation conventions to help inform navigation design and IA.


## Analysis Summary
I looked at 3 apps in detail: 
- One Medical
- ComEd
- State Farm

I chose these apps because health, insurance, and utility apps emerged during the comparative audit as three categories that seemed most relevant and comparable to the VA MVP app.
