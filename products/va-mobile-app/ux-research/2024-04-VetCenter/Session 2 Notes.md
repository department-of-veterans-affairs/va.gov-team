Vet Centers
Tell us a little bit about your role/ experience at Vet Centers? 
Works for the RSCES as a writer/editor on the communications teams. They work hand in hand with the Drupal team, like Michelle.
Helps outreach specialists at each of the Vet Centers to update their websites
Vet centers don’t have website specialists
Outreach specialists are hired to reach out to Veterans
She’s also the section 508 coordinator
The website seems to enable coordinators to better connect and contact Veterans 
Don’t get to track demographics
She’s got a general awareness of the app but not too detailed 
What are some of the main things you do?
What are some of the main challenges you confront?


How do Veterans typically learn about the services Vet Centers provide? How do they qualify?
Outreach is the buzzword. Each vet center (there are 303) has an outreach specialist
They give veterans a brochure with a QR code that informs them about the intent of Vet centers 
Brochure says come to us and if we can’t help you then we have a referral option to the place that can help Veterans get help
They’re able to embed national information in the local vet center website
Example of local info - come to the vet center for vet guitar event  
They’re seeing people go to the websites and call the crisis line
They have a lot of scenarios in which people will go out an meet Veterans
Why do you think that website traffic has increased so much?
Part of it is cus we’re pushing the merits of the website 
It’s on all of their branding and marketing which links Veterans to their local vet center
How do Vet Center services overlap with mental health services provided by VAMCs across the country, if at all?
The legacy of the Vet Center program is that it was started by Vietnam vets who did not like the VAMCs. These guys wanted talk therapy and did not want more drugs which felt more pushed by medical centers 
Veterans are coming to the Vet centers for social reasons not necessarily for behavioral health 
There’s a separate records system that the Vet center uses. Unless there is signed permission, Vet center will not share information with VAMCs
