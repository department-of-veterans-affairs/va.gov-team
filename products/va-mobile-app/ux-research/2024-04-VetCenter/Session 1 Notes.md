Notes w/ Tracy W
Vet Center Counselor
South Texas 

Overview:
App is good for Vietnam vets because it is super simple and website can be confusing. She shows them stuff on the phone to help them because using the GFA computer is so much work
Shows them on their own phone or has them download it.

How are Vets Centers different from VAMCs?

Clinical or trauma work is the same - community based so have placed in town
They take anyone - clinics have to take folks who are eligible
Federal non-profit - non billing - take anyone - less restrictive in protocols - more liberty and more time
Not pushing them out when done - push them to groups as opposed to trying to get them out of the system where they are not using services
More flexible - 

Share what percentage are also using VA medical centers
Strong overlap - majority use both - use clinic and then use us
10-15% are bad discharges which makes them not eligible f
Don’t use CPRS (probtrams and outpatient scheduling system, EHRS)- own system RPS - but have access to CPRS - layer of protection.
For folks who want mental health but not on record like with the clinical side (like law enforcement)
Border patrol, law enforcement, funnel towards them because they want their medical and mental health separate due to stigma and stereotype.  

Is that common knowledge?
It's word of mouth, hear from buddies that it is confidential. Feel safe that if they provide medical records it wouldn’t include mental health if they go to the Vet center.

Problem if can’t coordinate with clinics?
Vet center don't do medications - kso will contact medical clinic and tell them about why they should get medication. If not familiar they will make veterans start from ground zero even if veterans have been in treatment for years with the vet center.
Using the app to request medication - see if there is active script that they can fill at their own. If a script is expired they can coordinate care to get script reactivated. A bit more easier to coordinate. 
Start from current medication list and come at it from that place

Have there been situations where they are things wanted to do but couldn’t?
Getting them on board - on the clinic side - direct messaging link for vet centers to clinics. Help Veterans use their own messaging.

WHen you are supporting Veterans do you use digital tools? The method you use?
Gotten a lot on text messaging because they are forgetful.
No way for them to send out messages (which they had a way to send messages out to the group) 
Has to use personal cell which could be problematic
Would love to be able to send messages and reminders

How do people come to you?
Referals from clinics (medical centers) and VA behavior health
Get a lot of influx from veterans submitting claims (they get sent to them to provide evidence)
End up liking it and sticking with it
Don’t do claims, but can use notes to submit to claims.
Do a lot of outreach
Most of the folks are Veterans themselves and are very engaged (she is part of Wounded warriors, etc)
Put face out there
Not allowed to put things out on facebook, flyers are hard to do
Often referrals are for problematic folks or if their case loads are huge so they will pass them to the vet centers.
If someone is having trouble with a clinician might get switched over 
She will get female Veterans since she is a female
Lots of refer back and forth
When she is out in town and folks are asking where there claims are she will show them on the phone. 
Alot of frustrating because Veterans dont know how the system works
Can use the app to quickly pull up their information for them

Other other groups you work with?
Work with a bunch of local vet organization, non profits, county based, state based, for referral of services.
Work really well with neighboring organizations

How decide outside groups vs. within VA network
Depends on what looking for - ex if Veteranis 100% and is homeless, they wont even recommend them to the clinic. Eligibilty has a lot to do where they will go. 
Have to work with the red tape - if they fit it she will send them to clinics - otherwise will find something in town

Apps she has on her phone
CBTI (cog behavior something coach 
Mindfulness
Some she feels like have good intentions (like PTSD coach - but its; to many steps and info too much to read too much click)

App
English as a second language because it is simple and easy to ready
Folks will come to her confused and don’t speak good english and she will show them where to go and help them save their passwords
Don’t know their passwords is a big problem
Call her then she can walk them through the app vs. a whole website

Are there times would recommend or use the website
Depends on what they are needing. 
She might need to use intake form (sounds like internal tools to Jen)

Dishonorable folks  one group that might not qualify? They might not have app?
They could do claims. 
If have PTSD and got kicked out because of it they have been upgrading discharges - they can check those claims - just having an app that says that. Makes them feel like part of something, the app and having the VA logo make them feel like they are a Veteran
Work with a lot of folks who made a mistake and need to remind the they are still a Veteran. You are part of a community. 

Estimate how many Veterans do you support?
Caseload is probably 110 Veterans
Probably 50-60 have the app
Older population gets frustrated and hot headed younger ones, take extra stimulus away, take clutter away.

What are the areas we should focus on to support Veterans (va employees)? What are things that don’t exist yet?
Offered to do a little mini focus group

She likes simplicity - not sure she wants us to add a lot of stuff. Likes simplicity

Would love to be able to use a Veterans app but as herself so she can help Veterans. 

Education piece - no applying but getting letters around GI bill eligibility

PTSD app and the crisis line text app
Too many prompts - Veterans got super frustrated and disconnect from the text

If you were going to give us advice are there specific instability situations? Instability the right word?
Maybe a resources for that. Clinic is very VA focus - have to need very severe symptons if use clinic. Vet center has their own hotline, its clinicians, you don’t have to be in dire situtation, and they have follow up
AKA people falling in the gray area
877-war-vets

Vibe is much different at Vet centers
Have luxury of time since non-profit
VA is a billing system 

Some clinics are all about them and some try to persuade folks out of the Vet center not sure why, do they need numbers?

We are therapists - but also connectors, and help navigate the system
