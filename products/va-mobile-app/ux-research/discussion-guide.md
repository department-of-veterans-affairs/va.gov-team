# Discussion Guide: Mobile App Discovery
April 28, 2020 

## Introduction (5 minutes)
Thank you for joining us today. My name is Bridget and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes.

I am working with the VA to explore how VA can better serve and meet the needs of Veterans. Today, I’d like to talk about how you interact with the VA and how your experience with VA could be improved. Our conversation today will be pretty high-level - we’re at an early point in our research, and are looking to learn about all the potential ways to better serve or meet your needs with regards to your interaction with the VA. 

Before we start, there are a few things I want to mention:
- Our conversation should take about 45-50 minutes.
- In our conversation today, we want to hear your honest opinions. My team’s goal is to improve VA digital tools to better meet the needs of Veterans like you. I will not be offended by any opinions you express - please be as honest as you feel comfortable being with me today.
- If it’s alright with you, I would like to record our conversation. We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are deleted after we complete analysis, and won’t be used for anything other than our internal research purposes. Are you comfortable if I record the screen and audio as we talk today?
- If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

Those are all the logistics I wanted to share. Do you have any questions for me before we get started?

- Can you walk me through how frequently you need to interact with the VA to manage your benefits?

## Ideal world (10 minutes)
Thank you for sharing everything you’ve shared with us so far. What I’d like to do now is ask you some “blue sky” questions about how you’d like to interact with the VA via your mobile device in an ideal world. 

- When thinking about VA benefits we’ve discussed today, does anything stick out as an area that would benefit from being manageable via a VA mobile app?

    - What types of things can you do?
    - What type of information is included?
    - How frequently would you want to interact with VA via this mobile app?

- How do you see a mobile app bringing value in this area as opposed to a website?
   - How would you describe the benefit to you? What does the app do for you?

[Recap of areas discussed so far] Are there other areas where a mobile app could be useful? If multiple areas would be useful, please let us know - we would like to hear about anything you would find useful.

**Journey imagination**
I’d like to ask now about your overall experience with VA, and talk about your experience with VA from when you first started interacting with VA until now. 
- Thinking back on your experience with VA, where in your journey with VA could an app have been useful to you?
