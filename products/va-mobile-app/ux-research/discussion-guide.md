# Discussion Guide: Mobile App Discovery
April 28, 2020 

## Introduction (5 minutes)
Thank you for joining us today. My name is Bridget and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes.

I am working with the VA to explore how VA can better serve and meet the needs of Veterans. Today, I’d like to talk about how you interact with the VA and how your experience with VA could be improved. Our conversation today will be pretty high-level - we’re at an early point in our research, and are looking to learn about all the potential ways to better serve or meet your needs with regards to your interaction with the VA. 

Before we start, there are a few things I want to mention:
- Our conversation should take about 45-50 minutes.
- In our conversation today, we want to hear your honest opinions. My team’s goal is to improve VA digital tools to better meet the needs of Veterans like you. I will not be offended by any opinions you express - please be as honest as you feel comfortable being with me today.
- If it’s alright with you, I would like to record our conversation. We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are deleted after we complete analysis, and won’t be used for anything other than our internal research purposes. Are you comfortable if I record the screen and audio as we talk today?
- If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

Those are all the logistics I wanted to share. Do you have any questions for me before we get started?

## Icebreaker (5 minutes)

  - Are there certain ways you prefer to interact with the VA? If so, why? 
- Can you walk me through how frequently you need to interact with the VA to manage your benefits?
  - Which of the benefits you mentioned require the most interaction with the VA?

## Ideal world (10 minutes)
Thank you for sharing everything you’ve shared with us so far. What I’d like to do now is ask you some “blue sky” questions about how you’d like to interact with the VA via your mobile device in an ideal world. 
- When thinking about how you’d *like* to interact with the VA via your mobile device, what types of things come to mind? Why?
- When thinking about the VA benefits we’ve discussed today, does anything stick out as an area that would benefit from being manageable via a VA mobile app? Why? If multiple areas would be useful, please let us know - we would like to hear about anything you would find useful.
- How do you see a mobile app bringing value in these areas as opposed to a website?
- Can you talk a litte bit about at what point in accessing or managing a benefit you might find a mobile app useful?
  - How frequently do you think you would want to interact with the VA via a mobile app? 

_Summary of potential areas to probe on_

  - Claims
  - Payments

  - Dental benefits
  - Education benefits
  - Healthcare benefits
  - Eligibility or coverage information
