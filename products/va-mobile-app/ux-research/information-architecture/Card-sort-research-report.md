### OCTO-DE Objectives

The following are the [OCTO-DE objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme) that this research supports.



1. Increase the usage and throughput of VA services
2. Decrease the time Veterans spend waiting for an outcome
3. Increase the quality and reliability of VA services


### OCTO-DE Goals

The following are the [OCTO-DE ](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme)goals that this research supports.



1. Veterans can manage their health services online
2. Logged-in users can easily track applications, claims, or appeals online
3. Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features


### Veteran Journey



* Primary point in the Veteran journey: “Taking care of myself”
* Secondary points: “Reinventing myself, “Putting down roots,” and “Retiring”


## Research Goals



* To understand Veterans mental models for VA health and benefits services and how they would logically group them so we can tailor an information architecture that supports those mental models.
* To understand how Veterans would group items that are on our road map but not yet in the App to future proof the Information Architecture.
* To understand where Veterans would expect to find vaccine records in an app within the current information architecture.

Research questions

To understand mental models of health and benefits services:



* How do participants categorize items?
* Why do they pick the categories for items?

To test current information architecture as it relates to vaccines:



* Where do Veterans expect to find vaccine records?
* Why did they choose the path they did?


## Method



* Moderated open card sort exercise in Optimal Workshop. 
* Followed by a qualitative interview, using a prototype in Balsamiq (moderator driven).


### Hypothesis



1. Veterans will categorize items in a similar manner to how they are organized on VA.gov. In the current app information architecture.

**False/ Not enough information: **

While Veterans grouped some items as expected, they also grouped items in a different way and also misinterpreted some of the key cards. The data we collected was less quantitative and more qualitative but overall did not give us a clear answer to purpose a solidified IA. 



2. Veterans will look for vaccine records under health care and have no issues finding it. 

**False:**

Veterans clicked the COVID-19 Vaccine button and were taken to the va.gov COVID-19 information, not their vaccine record. 


## Key Findings



1. Depending on where the Veteran is in the Veteran journey, they find different services important.
2. GI Bill related items were a clear grouping.
3. Participants mostly grouped health care items together.
4. 4/9 Participants created a separate payment category.
5. All cards in sort were not clear to the Veterans. 
6. Contact the VA was grouped in various locations. 
7. Secure messaging was not grouped into one clear category

Details of Findings



1. **Depending on where the Veteran is in the Veteran journey, they find different services important.**

Labels: importance of services to Veteran

Brief description: While Heath care, payments, Veteran information and disability are all of high importance to all participants, some items were of varying importance to each participant. For example if the Veteran no longer had any open claims, that was not important to them, or if they used all of their GI Bill balance, they are not interested in checking in on it. Same for managing dependents some participants found this very important while most did not. 

Supporting data: "There are some things that I won't touch or ever look at again" (ex: GI bill) P11 \


Supporting data: “Claim status, I would check this a lot when I was in the claims process. (not anymore)” P10



2. **7/9 Participants did not find Vaccines in the prototype on their first try.**

Labels: VA Vaccine, COVID-19, COVID-19 information \
 \
Brief description: When asked where they would go in the app to find their last COVID-19 Vaccine, 7/9 Veterans clicked the card labeled “COVID-19 Vaccine.” After some prompting and explaining that it is in fact not going to be found there, the Veterans eventually found it in the Health Care section \




3. **GI Bill related items were a clear grouping**

Labels: GI Bill, Education, Payments, GI Balance

Brief description: 8/9 participants grouped all of the GI Balance and Payments together and 6/9 included GI Bill dependents and education payments in the GI grouping. Items together even if they were a payment or a balance due instead of putting those within the payments section. 

Supporting data: “Any managing education stuff all together. Easier to have it separate from ebenefits area.” P5



4. **Participants grouped health care items together**

Labels: Health Care, Secure Messaging, Health records, prescriptions, Appointments

Brief description: Overall Health care related items were grouped together including: Appointments, Secure Messaging, Health records, and prescriptions. While there was not 100% a grouping here, there was enough crossover to make a strong case to keep Health Care related items together. 

Supporting data: Combined health records and prescriptions together. "I should get all of my information, my labs, my vaccinations...all in one place." P7



5. **4/9 Participants created a payment category.**

Labels: Benefits, payments, balance

Brief description: Participants prioritized anything payment related as very important to them. They also expected it to be in the same area with the exception of GI Bill related items. 2 Participants separated payments they would owe to the VA and money they received from the VA. Since a payment section is not currently in the app and it was highly ranked, it would be worth including this grouping as a separate category. 

Supporting data: "Everything to do with money I'd like to keep in one place" P14



6. **All cards in sort were not clear to the Veterans. **

Labels: rename, rewrite

Brief description: Items that required explaining: Contact the VA, Military Information, Biometric Sign-in, Patient check-in, Join an video appointment, and Disability versus pension payments. 

Supporting data: Was unsure what 'join a video appointment' was, questions about what biometric settings were P11

Supporting data: Wasn't sure what "patient check-in" meant exactly. P6



7. **Contact the VA was grouped in various locations.**

Labels: Contact the VA, call, message, VA phone number

Brief description: The Contact the VA card was omnipresent throughout the card sort, not belonging to any one group. The reasoning behind this is that Veterans contact the VA for various reasons. However, after asking a bit more about it, participants were not always referring to the general 1-888 number but specific contact information pertaining to the task they were trying to accomplish, for example their primary provider. It is worth noting that. It is also worth noting that calling the VA is a strong part of the participants’ experience. When I asked more about why, I found that it is largely due to not being able to find what they need on the website. Reasons for not being able to complete the task on the website ranged from a cognitive overload, confusing IA, and inaccurate statuses for claims. 

Supporting data: "I feel like Contact the VA should be in every one of them, [so you can contact them whenever]" \


Supporting data: P11 mentioned the search function several times. He usually calls the VA contact because they know what he needs to do and where to do it. Usually spends about 10 minutes trying to find it on his own on the website, and then calls. P11



8. **Secure messaging was not grouped into one clear category**

Labels: Contact the VA, secure messaging

Brief description: Participants did not have one clear category where they put Secure Messaging. Interestingly, most participants grouped Secure Messaging with the services they use it for. Since three participants use secure messaging to schedule appointments, they categorized it with appointments. One participant uses it to order prescriptions, so they put it with prescriptions. Two participants grouped it in a category they identified as “personal” indicating that this is an item unique to them. 

Supporting data: "I use secure messaging with both prescriptions and appointments[...]I guess it could go in both or either '' When prompted to choose one, he put it in prescriptions since he uses it more with that P10.

**Additional Insights:**



* There is general anxiety around Disability. Veterans need their disability status to be reliable and do not trust that what they see on va.gov is accurate. 
* Veterans need a focused way to complete relevant tasks in the app. 
* Veterans primarily schedule over the phone or through secure messaging because they trust the process and know how to do it. 

Recommendations



1. **Consider a new information architecture that takes a layered approach for various use cases. **
* <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Here is the recommended IA based</span> on the findings and insights from this study. It is worth noting that there is not one solution for the IA and while this is a recommendation, it is a starting point and will need refining. 
* Some items in the card sort are items on the road map but not yet in the app and require us to consider where they might live as we add them. 
* Veterans find value in grouping features and information to support accomplishing tasks. However, these groups may not be mutually exclusive. 
* We think that any IA will be more successful when backed by thoughtful cross-linking and bubbling of information, and possibly a search feature.
2. **Use personalization to better surface relevant information and cut across silos.**

The IA needs to address the high priority use cases we know about by thoughtfully grouping information to increase accessibility depending on each Veteran’s needs. This probably means that data will show up in more than one place in the app. Timely surfacing of data may facilitate users in completing tasks within the app.  

For example:



* Checking existing disability rating and seeing progress of ongoing claim
* Quickly see money received to date and ne0t expected payments
* Making it easy to message your healthcare team about a specific R0 or Appointment

**Secondary Recommendations**



1. **Remove the “COVID-19 Vaccine” card from the top of the home screen. **

Since Veterans found it confusing and misleading, we recommend changing the name to “VA COVID-19 information” and reducing the visual hierarchy. 



2. **In order to add a level of clarity and understanding to some of the items, consider rewording/ redefining items. **

The following items were unclear to participants: Biometrics, Contact the VA, patient check-in, Military Information, Join an video appointment, and Disability versus pension payments. 

Participants needed an explanation of what these items were and expressed confusion around them. 



3. **Bring disability to the surface**
* Consider bringing the Veteran’s name and disability rating to the homescreen to make completing the task of checking disability rating easier and make the app feel more personable by bringing pertinent information to the surface. 
* Disability rating and claim status was of high importance for participants. 
* Checking the status of a claim was a major pain point across the research. 
3. **Create a way for “Benefits” to be easily accessible and consider an IA where they are grouped together. **

Being able to check benefit balances and payment information was highly important. Veterans also grouped payment related items together. For this reason we suggest considering ways to surface these items in the IA or consider possibilities where they are discoverable. 



4. **Consider changing the name of “profile” to something that more accurately represents the section of all of the Veteran’s personal and military information along with VA letters. **

None of the participants created a category titled “Profile.” However, participants grouped most of the items that are currently in the profile together. Veterans expressed a need to have all of their personal information in one place.

Next Steps

**Test the recommended IA using a treejack test with 200 Veterans to validate the new IA. **

While we have quality findings and have derived insights to inform decisions around the IA, we need to test this with a substantial number of participants in order to get truly quantitative results. To do this, we recommend using an optimal workshop tree test.
