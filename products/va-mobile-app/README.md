# VA Mobile App

## Background
On VA.gov today, nearly 40% of all traffic comes from users on their mobile devices. Additionally, this traffic is typically driven by users that want to complete quick transactions, such as viewing Claims Status or Facility Locator. User research validated these analytics and VA has decided to build a mobile app for these users that will make it easier and faster to complete key transactions across the organization.

## Release Cycle
Because VSP's Collaboration Cycle is designed for web features, the VA Mobile App team is going to leverage parts of the process that make sense for mobile and create other quality control processes where it doesn't. For example, the VA Mobile App team is creating its own Accessibility review that is tailored to mobile devices. These deviations will be documented [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/mobile-collaboration%20cycle.md)
