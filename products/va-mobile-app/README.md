# VA Mobile App

## Background
Nearly 40% of all traffic to VA.gov comes from users on their mobile devices. This traffic is typically driven by users that want to complete quick transactions, such as viewing Claims Status or Facility Locator. Our team has a hypothesis, validated by user research, that native functionality in a mobile app will allow Veterans to more easily complete key transactions across VA Health and Benefits services.

## Release Cycle
Because VSP's Collaboration Cycle is designed for web features, the VA Mobile App team is going to leverage parts of the process that make sense for mobile and create other quality control processes where it doesn't. For example, the VA Mobile App team is creating its own Accessibility review that is tailored to mobile devices. These deviations will be documented [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/product/mobile-collaboration%20cycle.md)
