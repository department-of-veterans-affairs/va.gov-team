# VA Mobile App

## Background
On VA.gov today, nearly 40% of all traffic comes from users on their mobile devices. This traffic is typically driven by users that want to complete quick transactions, such as viewing Claims Status or Facility Locator. Our team has a hypothesis, validated by user research, that native affordances on an app could better allow Veterans to complete key transactions across both Health and Benefits services from VA.

## Release Cycle
Because VSP's Collaboration Cycle is designed for web features, the VA Mobile App team is going to leverage parts of the process that make sense for mobile and create other quality control processes where it doesn't. For example, the VA Mobile App team is creating its own Accessibility review that is tailored to mobile devices. These deviations will be documented [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/mobile-collaboration%20cycle.md)
