# Purpose

To explore the question of whether the VA should have a flagship mobile app, we must first understand if Veterans desire one. Our *Veteran Desirability* reserach is focused on understanding pain points of Veterans how they might be solved using a mobile app. 

## Research
Our initial discovery into *Veteran Desirability* consisted of two activites broken into two phases: 
- **Phase one:** [Card sorting](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/va-mobile-app/discovery-sprint/veteran-desirability/card-sorting)
- **Phase two:** [Usability testing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/va-mobile-app/discovery-sprint/veteran-desirability/usability-testing)

## Timeline: 

- **Phase one:** Feb 28 - March 9, 2020
- **Phase two:** March 9 - March 30, 2020

## Outcome

At the end of the discovery sprint, we had two bets about what Veterans desire in a VA mobile app:
1. **Features:** Authenticated features are more valuable to Veterans than unauthenticated features
2. **Added Value:** A mobile application provides more value to Veterans than a mobile VA.gov experience.

The next step is to validate these bets. See: [ux-research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-research)
