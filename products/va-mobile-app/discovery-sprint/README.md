# Background
In late February of 2020, a four-week discovery sprint kicked off to explore three basic questions related to whether and how the VA should build a mobile app. 

The questions of **what** the VA would build and **why** the VA should build a mobile app focused on *Veteran Desirability* and user research to determine whether Veterans would actually want or use an app. 

The question of **how** the VA should build a mobile app focused on *Technical Feasibility* research and experimentation to determine how the VA could build an app given the systems and technologies that exist at VA today.
