# Defining the Most Important Metrics for the VAHB Mobile App

## What story are we trying to tell through the data?
The data can tell 2 stories: A story about the user’s experience **(experiential metrics)** and a story about the platform’s health **(platform metrics)**.

## Experiential metrics

**Experiential metrics** capture the quality of the user’s experience — how well the product helps people achieve their goals. They can provide insight into how users experience the app, including navigation patterns, common tasks, and points of friction. Experiential metrics can be measured through **user tasks** and **non-tasks**.

### User Tasks
**User Tasks** are goal-oriented actions that a user initiates with intent to complete a specific objective. Examples:
* Logging in 
* Sending a secure message
* Updating contact information
* Requesting a prescription refill
* Submit evidence

**Characteristics:**
* Requires user effort and decision-making
* Has a clear beginning and end
* Can typically be labeled as “completed” or “not completed”

We have organized user tasks by user flow. User tasks and associated metrics for 14 key flows are mapped in this [spreadsheet](URL).

### Non-tasks
**Non-tasks** are passive, informational, or exploratory interactions not necessarily tied to a concrete goal. Examples:
* Receiving a push notification
* Browsing the home screen
* Viewing disability rating
* Viewing claim status
* Viewing appointments

**Characteristics:**
* May not have a defined end state
* Doesn’t always result in a transaction or submission
* Often serves to inform, guide, or prompt future actions

Non-tasks have also been identified for each key user flow. Non-tasks and associated metrics for 14 key flows are mapped in this [spreadsheet](URL).

| Type | What to measure | Sample metrics | Notes | 
|--------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| **User Tasks** | Task success and efficiency | - Task completion rate<br>- Time on task<br>- Error rate<br>- Drop-off rate<br>- Retry attempts | Collect in-app analytics on key flows (e.g. Rx refill, viewing appointments).|
| **Non-tasks** | User engagement and awareness | - Views<br> - Click-through rate (CTR)<br>- Dwell time <br>- Notification open rate | Focus on passive or content-related interactions. Can serve as leading indicators of task initiation. |

## Platform metrics

**Platform metrics** center around the performance, stability, and operational health of the underlying platform or system that delivers the experience. These metrics are:
- **system-centered** and measured from the technical perspective, and usually quantitative and diagnostic
- Intended to capture **a pulse of how users feel about the overall app**. 

### How should we define "the overall health" of the Mobile Platform? 
*"I want an application that is fast, stable, and accurately supports my needs as a Veteran."* 

Overall platform health can be measured by the platform's speed, availability, reliability, consistency, overall user satisfaction, adoption, and retention. Each table below defines each measurement factor and provides helpful metrics to track and how they can inform decision-making.
