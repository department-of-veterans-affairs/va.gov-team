[*A short narrative (3–5 sentences) drafted answering what story we are trying to tell through the data, what impact we want to show, and which dimensions matter most*]

## What are the most important metrics for the Mobile Platform team to track?
 
|      | Accessing the App and Logging In |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **User goal**      | *"I need convenient access to view and manage my VA health benefits on-the-go."* |
| **What should we measure?** | Successful login, the first time<br> *"I was easily able to login the first time."* |
