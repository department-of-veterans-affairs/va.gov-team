      * Add documentation for Mobile component into the VADS docs
      * Forgiveness over permission from VADS group
      * create a ticket to propose adding something to VADS documentation
        * do something simple to start

*   Sharing Icons with VADS?
    *   VADS is moving to Google Icons instead of FontAwesome in 2024
    *   Some changes we would need may happen with the transition anyway
    *   Ryan to find out who we should work with on VADS team - Matt Dingee
    *   Service Branch logos should be shared as well, we just need the .svg
*   Design Token strategy
    *   We are looking into how we can use VADS Design Tokens directly
      *   We will definitely be able to use their 'primitive' tokens (basic colors)
      *   Not sure yet about other kinds of tokens like typography, but we think it's possible
        *   We can add mobile-specific things on top of that
      *   VADS is missing some USWDS colors so we could pull directly from USWDS
      *   Ryan: if we could just have VADS bring in all colors we need from USWDS so we only pull from VADS, would that be easier?  Narin: yeah
        *   Ask Matt Dingee about them adding more colors

## 10/12/23
*   Discuss Review/Feedback process (based on Service Blueprint work)
     -  How and where and who do we want to have a review/approval process?
     -  Use Cases that could differ:
        -   Non-flagship VA team adding functionality to the Flagship app
            -   Flagship Product group, Ryan would review (smallest number possible)
        -   Non-flagship VA team building a new app
            -   Less governance needed
     -   We definitely want some sort of review
*   Discuss QA process/Release Mgmt strategy
    -   non-flagship VA teams submitting PRs for QA testing
        -   size of the PR not equivalent to QA effort
        -   How can we effectively set expectations for QA time?
        -   Could/should non-flagship teams write their own tests not maintained by the Flagship team?
            -  Yes please.  Definitely unit tests, ideally E2E tests as well.  We would want them to watch if their merge breaks tests not related to their functionality as well.
        -   Non-flagship teams should do their own QA, but also the Shared Services QA team would need to sign off prior to merging their feature branches
