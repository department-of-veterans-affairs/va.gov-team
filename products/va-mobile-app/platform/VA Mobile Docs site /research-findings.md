## Research Goals
1.  Identify how the VA Mobile Docs site can be improved to better serve all teams. 
2.  Determine when we can link experience teams to VADS and when we should give guidance. 
3.  EXP teams are able to access the docs site and find answers to their questions.

## Research Questions
- Who is using the VA Mobile docs site today?
- How frequently are they interacting with the site?
- Do they need to go elsewhere to find information to build for mobile?
- What questions do they have after visiting the VA mobile docs site?
- How does the content on the VA Mobile docs site serve the needs of the different users (engineering, UX design/researchers, business, etc.)?
- How satisfied are experience team members with the current VA mobile docs site?

## Methodology
Method 1: User Interviews

## Hypotheses and Conclusions
- We understand that the current VA Mobile Docs site is outdated and not fully aligned with the evolving needs of various experience teams. We anticipate our research to help us identify user satisfaction with the site in its current state.
  - MAYBE TRUE
  -  Users had mixed responses about the site in its current state. Although some elements of the site received a positive sentiment, the site didn’t get regular usage for various reasons and users had mixed sentiment about it. 
- As well as provide insight into what experience team users need from the site to guide the redesign.
  - TRUE
  - Users shared reasons why they visited the site, what was missing, and what they needed from the site to use in the future.
- Our hypothesis assumes that by updating and tailoring the documentation on the site to include current best practices and user-specific guidance while also improving overall site navigation that user satisfaction and the frequency of site usage will increase.
  - MAYBE TRUE
  - Participants noted a desire for reframing the content based on the experience team user. They also shared confusions with the current site navigation and difficulties locating specific content. Several users noted that knowing the site was being updated would cause them to revisit it or reference it more.

## Key Findings
1. Most participants noted a desire to clearly identify differences in experiences between building for web vs. building for mobile. 
2. Participants shared a wide array of information they often sought out from the site that was missing while also sharing what content they felt was not helpful existing on the site today.
3. Participants desired content that was easily injestible, providing context for the user, background in why decisions were made, as well as statuses of those decisions.
4. Many participants shared a common sentiment around difficulty finding information needed on the site. Often having to ask the team for information after visiting the site in detail.
5. Most participants spoke of a desire for more governance around mobile, with a tighter integration to the existing Platform. Calling out specifically the Platform collaboration cycle, and the VA design system.
6. Participants noted visiting the site mostly during onboarding, set up, and when starting various phases of a project for reference. Many participants shared a similar sentiment of distrust with the site content due to inconsistencies across the site and compared to other authoritative sources, or noted site information being outdated. 
7. Despite needing many improvements, most participants did share delights they appreciated that could be modeled in other areas of the site related to structure, content, and detail. 
8. Participants noted a need for onsite feedback submissions, to be able to help identify content gaps/problems as they arise. 
9. More seasoned site users noted using the site less as they became more familiar with the process.

## Details of Findings
**Finding 1:**
Most participants noted a desire to clearly identify differences in experiences between building for web vs. building for mobile. 
- “There are a lot of differences , but what should be the same? Core functionality, they should be able to do x.” [Regarding alert designs for mobile vs. web from the appointments team.]
- “Would like to see more of a comparison on mobile.”
- “Design system: They need to document more clearly when delineation should happen between experiences like notifications.”
- “Alerts was one of the things I find really challenging, because we have a lot of alerts on web. When translating that to mobile, some of it should be a whole page? What situations should that be a whole page alert on mobile? Should the information alerts on web translate to a pull out drawn alert component or informational alert component?”
- “When inheriting something there is a big discrepancy. To understand why it is different and where it is in the process of things.”
                                                                                                                  
**Finding 2:**
Participants shared a wide array of information they often sought out from the site that was missing while also sharing what content they felt was not helpful existing on the site today.
**Re: Engineering**
- “In the set up docs, there is no call out for specific versions of the dependencies.”
- “What version of Java? There is a link with the answer, the link brings you to the latest version but the link says Java 8 or whatever it is. I was able to ascertain that by looking at the link but if you follow the link it takes you to the latest version no matter what.”
- “Weird kinks in the set up process, access to Firebase to pull down configuration files add barriers to entry for contributing.”
- “Historical architectural decisions, why things are set up a different way. Still really hard to find.” 
- “Getting context is tough”
- “Other things I look for, React native documentation, various documentation around the tools we use and how we use them.”
- “Lots of assumptions I knew how to do. Lots of references to do x without explaining the how to do x. I still had a lot of follow up questions.”
**Re: Designers**
- “A pretty big gap between foundations, and then how you use it.”
- “There are foundational things and component level things, not stuff in between at a page levels or automatic. How things might work together.”
- “Often when you start putting things together there is space for interpretation for what is based on the UX vs. the UI. Often the UX is missing.”
- “Like to see more guidance if what we are building is new and is currently not in the doc site what should I do... Should I reach out to someone? How do I get it approved?”
- “Remember having trouble finding navigation and some interactive principles, I don’t think it's there even today.”

**Finding 3:**
Participants desired content that was easily injestible, providing context for the user, background in why decisions were made, as well as statuses of those decisions.
- “I was like oh my god this is going to be horrible documentation when I first looked at it. Then was like, well, this is actually pretty good.”
- “Make it a one-pager”
- “The things that are not so much opinion vs. here is concrete how you get things done and here are some diagrams cause we know you’re not going to read all of this.”
- “API docs are way less helpful than the front end docs. It says to do x but there is no how or where info given.”
- “More highly opinionated in how one should interact with the design team.  Lots of caveats to how you interact.”
- “Information around feature flagging vs. availability framework is a bit confusing, I’m still not entirely sure I’m using it correctly? “
- “When there is similar information how do we avoid being repetitive so designers can quickly spot what is different.”

**Finding 4:**
Many participants shared a common sentiment around difficulty finding information needed on the site. Often having to ask the team for information after visiting the site in detail.
- “Trying to search for things in general, it is very hit or miss. Sometimes it just nails it, or other times I find myself digging.”
- “Things may be located where I wouldn’t expect to find it.”
- “Better organization, updated organization, documentation around the release process, how it functions, could be applied more broadly in other areas. “
- “Finding out to what level it does exist or if it doesn’t exist at all was daunting at times.”
- "Scenarios where certain things are not structured in a consumable way, as I would hope."
- “Maybe instead of documentation, if I look at it I wouldn’t guess there is so much stuff in there. “
- “There isn’t a feedback option on the site (hey I was on this page and looking for this information and I couldn’t find it). Like the main VA platform docs do, mobile doesn’t have this.”

**Finding 5:**
Most participants spoke of a desire for more governance around mobile, with a tighter integration to the existing Platform. Calling out specifically the Platform collaboration cycle, and the VA design system.
- “Now that the job to add more features relies more on the individual product team instead of the mobile team internally, it would be helpful to know some of the process.”
- “Need better distinction of Rules vs. guidance. As there are products, where those touch points are, and how they fall in the governance on that.”
- “Biggest thing as a new team onboarding to this large ecosystem, anything that could point us to how we got where we are (help orient your brain on why we do things the way that we do).”
- “We are adding more new features to the mobile now, like to see more guidance if what we are building is new and is currently not in the doc site what should I do?”
- “Mobile team should work with the VA design system to integrate that in.”

**Finding 6:**
Participants noted visiting the site mostly during onboarding, set up, and when starting various phases of a project for reference. Many participants shared a similar sentiment of distrust with the site content due to inconsistencies across the site and compared to other authoritative sources, or noted site information being outdated.
- ”Honestly, when I come to the site, I think, is this accurate? What is the date on this, when was this last updated.”
- “Starting out on a new project I read through set up and installation.”
- “A lot during the initial local dev set up, spent a lot of time looking at the feature toggle and as we are going to deploy trying to understand how we can enable for specific users, how we can do roll outs.”
- “Discrepancy between what was on the site and what I was seeing things in Figma files.  The why? Is it documented?”
- “Inconsistencies in the documentation.”
- “First thing I did was put in a PR for out of date post-man selection and I don’t know if it ever got merged.”

**Finding 7:**
Despite needing many improvements, most participants did share delights they appreciated that could be modeled in other areas of the site related to structure, content, and detail. 
- “Front end docs are more fully flushed out.”
- “Good parts are the shorter engineer focused parts. This is just how my brain works. Doc site has totally worked. We’ve been able to use it to get up and running pretty quickly.”
- “The platform documentation is well established detailed on how to do things, lots of different channels to ask for help. Reference platform documentation for back end, all in the same monolith, mobile is it’s own little module inside of the VETS API”
- “Really easy to find alerts or other components.”
- “VA design system there is a deprecated, experimental, status. That is helpful.”
- “It does a pretty good job of painting some broad strokes”
- “As different areas of the development process came up that I was less familiar with, that was the first point of research”

## Additional Insights
1. All three Product managers recruited initially for this research expressed hesitation in being interviewed due to a lack of usage or familiarity with the site. They noted referring more to the mobile Github documentation site, which is where the VA mobile site redirects them to from the product specific pages. Today these Product pages lack direct content. The users don’t see themselves represented on the site and therefor rely on team members to use the site including engineers, QA, and ux designers. Content areas which are all well built out in depth on the site.

2. Users often desired to self-serve vs. ask questions of the mobile team. They also spoke of a desire for onsite feedback options.
- “I feel like I’m pulling somebody from their duties to update."
- "I feel frustrated...confused...bad bugging somebody about it....”
- "We should call out that any engineer, or anybody that is using the site and sees something out of date or should be added to is free to submit PRs and here’s how we do it.”
- “There isn’t a feedback option on the site (hey I was on this page and looking for this information and I couldn’t find it). Like the main VA platform docs do, mobile doesn’t have this.”

3. Other VA teams are experimenting with Ai with great success. 
- “Making robots explain things to me (uses VETS API copilot, Github copilot to review codebase)”
- “These days with the way technology is heading, the way we consume information. Integration with AI or LLM that could consume the documentation, be able to chat about it, narrow down specific questions. Where the future is heading.”
- “Us basically moving fast, using deployment as a strategy and understanding how veterans use stuff has allowed us to move very fast.”
- "If it’s this easy just do it, vs. creating a ticket to think about it.”

## Recommendations
- Conduct a site content audit. Review site content with area SMEs. 
- Remove site content that is duplicative, outdated, or too ambiguous. Adding missing content as noted within the user research.
- Update content to elaborate on needed context, adding the why, with dates, and statuses.
- Recommendation: Provide clear distinctions in mobile vs. web experiences using VA product examples and reasoning. Include visuals, prototypes, correct vs. incorrect applications.
- Integrate the mobile/flagship design system with VADS, moving relevant content over to design.va.gov vs. hosting directly on the site. Similarly, integrate mobile more fully in the platform collaboration cycle adding mobile governance throughout the process. 
- Add a FAQ section to the site and a troubleshooting guide to assist users with common challenges they often bring to the team.
- Add a feedback submission option directly to the site so users can directly report issues or questions as they arise. 
- Base the site structure on various phases of the mobile build process, the prime audience as the general experience team user vs. the area specific user (Product, UX, Engineering or QA). Develop the content around this user group, using a journey map to help them orient themselves in the process.
- Model the content fidelity of the site’s front-end documentation and set-up process, applying it to the other areas of the site. After SMEs have written updated guidance, have a single voice pass over all content for consistency, structure, and fidelity.  

## Product User and Business Outcomes
EXP Team satisfaction in relation to Docs Site is positive
  - This research supports this user outcome by understanding users' initial impressions of the site and how their sentiment changed at various points in the mobile development process.
EXP Teams show an increase in use of Docs Site
  - The research supports this user outcome by documenting user familiarity as well as self-reported frequency with the site. Understanding when they need to use it and for what purposes, as well as identifying reasons in which users may drop off.

## Next Steps
- Review research findings with internal mobile team 
- Brainstorm co-design session on new architectural model for site
- Content audit by SMEs
- Content redesign
- Transfer of mobile design system to VADS
                                                                                                                  
## Further research needed
- To gather quantitative data, getting a numerical rating of user satisfaction (survey base).
- Deeper study in the experience team member journey
