**Note:** While reviewing content related to design please take into consideration the feedback gathered by experience team members during user interviews. The intention is to move all mobile design system elements over to VADS. 
1. We need to first ensure everything we are bringing to them is up-to-date and accurate with how we want it reflected. 
2. After this confirmation, we can steward the information transfer to work closely with VADS on bringing it into their site, as well as continue maintenance. 
3. Will defer to their preference on how we collaborate with them on this transfer. Once content is available live we can remove it from our site, to avoid a gap for information is unavailable we need to retain all public facing information until it is live on VADS.


Defer to full experience team notes in this [Github folder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/va-mobile-app/platform/VA%20Mobile%20Docs%20site%20/interviews)  as needed:

# Information missing/inconsistent
1. Dates or statuses on design documentation needed
> P2 [designer]  There isn’t a status of where things are.
> 
> P2 [designer]  ”Honestly, when I come to the site, I think, is this accurate? What is the date on this, when was this last updated.”
> 
> P2 [designer]  Having dates on here is helpful so I can know if this was updated 2 months ago or 2 years ago.
> 

2. How components should interact together
> P2 [designer]  I’ll find documentation about one button but not how things lay out together.
> 
> P2 [designer]  There are foundational things and component level things, not stuff in between at a page levels or automatic. How things might work together.
> 
3. How to apply design system needed for Figma as well as code
> P2 [designer]  Design system is written like implementing a design system at a code base level not with designing in Figma.
> 
4. Gap in user experience best practices
> P2 [designer]  Often when you start putting things together there is space for interpretation for what is based on the UX vs. the UI. Often the UX is missing.
>
> P2 [designer]  How do we tell the narrative and work that together?
>
> P2 [designer]  A pretty big gap between foundations, and then how you use it.
>
> P2 [designer] Currently it is more highly opinionated in how one should interact with the design team.  Lots of caveats to how you interact.
>
> P6 [engineer]  The things that are not so much opinion vs. here is concrete how you get things done and here are some diagrams cause we know you’re not going to read all of this.
>
> P6 [engineer] Parts I did not read 100%, how we work and opinions on how to do things. 
>
> P3 [designer]  Re: the design principles I still wasn’t sure how some of the information applied
>
> P5 [designer]  Wasn’t looking for any of the content under the foundational page, assuming it was probably the same as the web design system. Any design principles should be the same.
>
> P5 [designer]  The guidance when to use it, when to use which alert and when to consider something else. It is very similar to web, I am also the design principles under the foundation page is also very similar.
>
5. Web vs. mobile
> P3 [designer] Looking for guidance that helped me differentiate the difference between the web design system library and the mobile.
>
> P2 [designer] I’m trying to find parody between what is on web and what is on mobile.
>
> P3 [designer]  Would like to see more of a comparison on mobile.
>
> P3 [designer]  On the appoints team, right now even the appointments list is very different between mobile and the web.
>
> P5 [designer]  Be specific about what can be different is important. How is this similar or different to the web design system?
>
> P5 [designer]   There are a lot of difference, what should be the same? Core functionality, they should be able to do x.
>
> P3 [designer]  Be specific about what can be different on mobile is important.
>
> P2 [designer]  Solving for mobile first would solve for the web experience. Like an MVP on how it should be for web.
>
6. VADS vs. mobile design system
> P2 [designer] RE: How Mobile team works with the VA design system to integrate. Real unclear right now. Longer that is unclear the more rogue features will go. 
>
> P2 [designer]  ”Honestly, when I come to the site, I think, is this accurate? What is the date on this, when was this last updated.”
>
> P2 [designer]  I am confused by the discrepancies between the VA design system design.va.gov / this one is department of affairs.github.org They are 2 separate things. 
>
> P3 [designer]  When there is similar information how do we avoid being repetitive so designers can quickly spot what is different.
>
> P3 [designer]   It is very similar to web, I am also the design principles under the foundation page is also very similar.
>
> P5 [designer]  Wasn’t looking for any of the content under the foundational page, assuming it was probably the same as the web design system. Any design principles should be the same.
>
> P5 [designer]  I.e. a few components we are borrowing directly from the native library, I wanted that part sectioned out from the rest of the component, specifically for the VA mobile app.
>
> P2 [designer] I’m jumping back and forth between the two. (VADS and Flagship mobile)  Change of context when jumping back and forth.
>
> P4 [engineer] Did a lot of work with the mobile design system, interacted with that team to understand where they were in the process, what their actual goals were and how that aligned with the VADS team and how that functioned. It felt very chaotic, everyone was going their own way. 
>
> P3 [designer]  Assuming it was probably the same as the web design system. Any design principles should be the same.
>
> P2 [designer]  Mobile team should work with the VA design system to integrate that in.

7. Design system gaps
> P2 [designer] Need a “getting started” section or here’s how you work with the mobile design system
>
> P3 [designer]  Remember having trouble finding navigation and some interactive principles, I don’t think it's there even today.
>
> P2 [designer]  Design system: They need to document more clearly when delineation should happen between experiences like notifications.
>
> P2 [designer] Many times we are solving the same problem but now for two different experiences.  They shouldn’t be that vastly different.
>
> P3 [designer]  Alerts was one of the things I find really challenging, because we have a lot of alerts on web. When translating that to mobile, some of it should that be a whole page?
>
> P3 [designer] What situations should that be a whole page alert on mobile? Should the information alerts on web translate to a pull out drawn alert component or informational alert component?
>
> P5 [designer]  Desire for any template that could help me start quickly to set up project files.
>
> P3 [designer]  Borrowing directly from the native library, I wanted that part sectioned out from the rest of the component, specifically for the VA mobile app.
>
> P3 [designer]  What I want to see is more interaction guidance.

8. Governance outlined for creating something new
> P3 [designer]  Like to see more guidance if what we are building is new and is currently not in the doc site what should I do... Should I reach out to someone? How do I get it approved?
>
> P2 [designer]  It is still a mystery, starting something new with mobile.
>
> P2 [designer] The more you can have decisions, even if they are in flux, document that they are in flux. 

9. Mobile integration in platform collab. Cycle
> P3 [designer]  How does the collab cycle work? Looks like they are working on that.
>
> P2 [designer] Mobile platform doesn’t feel baked into the collab cycle fully.  Same features but governance is different.
>
> P4 [engineer] In the midst of going through collab cycle right now, we are one of the first mobile focused teams to go through it. A learning experience on how it applies to mobile vs. not, has been referencing that platform site.

10. Getting help
> P4 [engineer] Get answers usually involving talking to someone, they point me somewhere else like a markdown or repo, or it is word of mouth explaining things. 

11. Maintenance of Figma files (what is live in production today?)
> P2 [designer] Discrepancy between what was on the site and what I was seeing things in Figma files.  The why? Is it documented?
>
> P2 [designer] How buttons were aligned, different from what we were seeing in the file we were working with. Different from the app and how the engineers were running the app.
>
> P2 [designer] Let me figure out why they were like that, a reason, initiative in place but not sanctioned and not documented.
>
> P2 [designer]  When inheriting something there is a big discrepancy. To understand why it is different and where it is in the process of things.

12. Mural board governance
> P4 [engineer] Mural boards are all over the place, trying to figure out the best ways to interact with those. A tighter integration between documentation site and the floating mural boards.

13. More governance outlined
> P2 [designer] Need better distinction of Rules vs. guidance
>
> P2 [designer] As there are products, where those touch points are, and how they fall in the governance on that.
>
> P2 [designer]  Not clear Naming of features or tickets (waits for a meeting for that sort of information).
>
> P2 [designer] Need documentation of governance as a whole.
>
> P5 [designer]  Should I reach out to someone? How do I get it approved?
>
> P2 [designer]  ”I was allowed to come into the walled garden only to look but not to come into the garden.”
>
> P5 [designer]  Now that the job to add more features relies more on the individual product team instead of the mobile team internally, it would be helpful to know some of the process.

# What’s working well

1. Easy to find specific components
> P5 [designer]  Really easy to find alerts or other components.
>
> P3 [designer]  Trying to find specific components. Alerts, or navigation. 

2. Referring also to USWDS
> P2 [designer] Reference USWDS (they don’t have native aspects of it)

3. Component statuses
> P2 [designer]  VA design system there is a deprecated, experimental, status. That is helpful.

4. Platform documentation 
> P1 [engineer] The platform documentation is well established detailed on how to do things, lots of different channels to ask for help

5. Getting questions answered
> P3 [designer]  Was able to get my questions answered.  Went to Jonathan Post  went to mobile team office hours
