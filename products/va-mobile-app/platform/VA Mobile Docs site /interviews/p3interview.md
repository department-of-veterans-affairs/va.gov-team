# P3 Notes: VA Mobile Forms Exp. Team Interviews


## Intro - 5 minutes
Thanks for joining me today! My name is Christine Julian. Today we're going to talk about the VA mobile docs site.
Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:
This entire session should take about 30 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.


Are you ok if I record this session for internal review?
Are you ready to begin?

## Warm up questions - 5 minutes
1. What is your role at the VA?
UX Designer and Researcher


2. How familiar are you with the VA Mobile doc site?
Used it last month for a project currently on pause, first time ever used

3. How frequently do you interact with the site?
During the project, used it twice a week


## Interview - 20 minutes
1. How did you first become aware of the VA Mobile Docs site?
- About a year or two ago, Ryan shared it in the channel in slack.

2. At what points in your mobile build process did you reference the site?
- Looking for guidance that helped me differentiate the difference between the web design system library and the mobile. 
- Specifically, spacing and margins for the screens.
- Any template that could help me start quickly to set up project files.

3. Can you describe your experience with the site?
- When first discovered, jumped to the design system page in the navigation.
- Wasn’t looking for any of the content under the foundational page, assuming it was probably the same as the web design system. Any design principles should be the same.
- Trying to find specific components. Alerts, or navigation.
- Really easy to find alerts or other components.
- Remember having trouble finding navigation and some interactive principles, I don’t think it's there even today.

4. What are the main challenges you face when using the site?
- What was challenging was after reading the information, the design principles I still wasn’t sure how some of the information applied… I.e. Alerts was one of the things I find really challenging, because we have a lot of alerts on web. When translating that to mobile, some of it should that be a whole page? What situations should that be a whole page alert on mobile? Should the information alerts on web translate to a pull out drawn alert component or informational alert component?
- Would like to see more of a comparison on mobile?

5. What additional questions, if any, did you have after visiting the site?
- Wondering why it is not part of the web design website.
- What I want to see is more interaction guidance.
I.e. a few components we are borrowing directly from the native library, I wanted that part sectioned out from the rest of the component, specifically for the VA mobile app.
- We are adding more new features to the mobile now, like to see more guidance if what we are building is new and is currently not in the doc site what should I do?
- Should I reach out to someone? How do I get it approved?
- Went to Jonathan Post first to answer my questions.
- Then went to mobile team office hours, found out through Jonathan. 
- Was able to get my questions answered.

6. How do you think the site can be improved to better support your needs?
- Now that the job to add more features relies more on the individual product team instead of the mobile team internally, it would be helpful to know some of the process.
- How does the collab cycle work? Looks like they are working on that.
- How is similar or different to the web design system?
- On the appoints team, right now even the appointments list is very different between mobile and the web. Fine, when we design more and more in that tool, communicating or setting a guideline to say “even the visual design is system, we use a different component to show the statuses, what should be the same” There are a lot of difference, what should be the same? Core functionality, they should be able to do x.
- Be specific about what can be different is important.
- The guidance when to use it, when to use which alert and when to consider something else. It is very similar to web, I am also the design principles under the foundation page is also very similar. 
- When there is similar information how do we avoid being repetitive so designers can quickly spot what is different.


7. Are there other sites you reference when building for mobile in your product?
- The Apple iOS and material design from google

8. Any additional feedback?
- Overall, the navigation on top. Documentation and design system, I’m remembering when I first used it I went to documentation to look for what would happen in the design system. Then I didn’t really see the design system later, when I couldn't find the components and their documentation then I went into the design system.
- Maybe combine it somehow under UX
- I wonder why you are using the side bars as the men nav.
- Maybe instead of documentation, if I look at it I wouldn’t guess there is so much stuff in there. Remove that out from the nav side bar and put that as main nav instead of side nav, would be helpful for others to find things.


## Thank-You and Closing - 1 minutes
