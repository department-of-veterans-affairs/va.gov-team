# P4 Notes: VA Mobile Forms Exp. Team Interviews

## Intro - 5 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is Christine Julian. Today we're going to talk about the VA mobile docs site.
Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:
This entire session should take about 30 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.

1. Are you ok if I record this session for internal review?
2. Are you ready to begin?

## Warm up questions - 5 minutes
1. What is your role at the VA?
Tech lead on mobile features support, including military history team


2. How familiar are you with the VA Mobile doc site? 
Pretty darn familiar 

3. How frequently do you interact with the site?
Earlier on a lot more, now that Iâ€™ve been around since Nov. it has died down a bit since then. 

## Interview - 20 minutes
1. How did you first become aware of the VA Mobile Docs site?
- From the VA mobile app repo reading the read me there

2. At what points in your mobile build process did you reference the site?
- Very early on, typically as an engineer when I am starting out on a new project I read through set up and installation, the general process to get the project up and running.
- Then mostly as different areas of the development process came up that I was less familiar with, that was the first point of research. 
- Would search it for key words to find information on that. 
- First point of contact, doing research on some part of the development process.

3. Can you describe your experience with the site?
- Some portions have been better than others I would say.
- It does a pretty good job of painting some broad strokes
- The set up instructions for the actual project, are pretty good
- Weird kinks in the set up process, access to Firebase to pull down configuration files add barriers to entry for contributing.
- In general, pretty decent job of laying those things out and brining to the awareness.
- One thing I would love to see, or have been asked about from developers on his team and sussing it out from the doc site or various other sources. Historical architectural decisions, why things are set up a different way. Still really hard to find.
- In order to make sure you are following the practices to make places,  it is important to understand how we got where we are. (10:17)

4. What are the main challenges you face when using the site?
- Scenarios where certain things are not structured in a consumable way, as I would hope.
- Earlier when core mobile team had a lapse in funding, I was tasked with making since of the deve ops portion of the workflow. All the various jobs, nuts and bolts. Started to read through the documentation, what was more helpful was just looking at the code myself. Perhaps a bit of my own bias.
- Better organization, updated organization, documentation around the release process, how it functions, could be applied more broadly in other areas. 
- Trying to search for things in general, it is very hit or miss. Sometimes it just nails it, or other times I find myself digging.

5. What additional questions, if any, did you have after visiting the site?
- Usually around context, context is tough. 
- Get answers usually involving talking to someone, they point me somewhere else like a markdown or repo, or it is word of mouth explaining things. 
- Scenario specific, reached out to Tim Wright to understand historical context around architectural decisions.
- Did a lot of work with the mobile design system, interacted with that team to understand where they were in the process, what their actual goals were and how that aligned with the VADS team and how that functioned.
- It felt very chaotic, everyone was going their own way. 

6. How do you think the site can be improved to better support your needs?
- These days with the way technology is heading, the way we consume information. Integration with AI or LLM that could consume the documentation, be able to chat about it, narrow down specific questions. Where the future is heading.

7. Are there other sites you reference when building for mobile in your product?
- In the midst of going through collab cycle right now, we are one of the first mobile focused teams to go through it. A learning experience on how it applies to mobile vs. not, has been referencing that platform site.
- Mural boards are all over the place, trying to figure out the best ways to interact with those.
- A tighter integration between documentation site and the floating mural boards.
- Other things I look for, React native documentation, various documentation around the tools we use and how we use them. 

8. Any additional thoughts?
- In general, a pretty decent site. Has a good starting point that is beneficial.
- Biggest thing as a new team onboarding to this large ecosystem, anything that could point us to how we got where we are (help orient your brain on why we do things the way that we do).
- What is your target audience? Tailoring your experience based off the target audience. A lot of really broad strokes.
