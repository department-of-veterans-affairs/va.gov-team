# P2 Notes: VA Mobile Forms Exp. Team Interviews
## Intro - 5 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is Christine Julian. Today we're going to talk about the VA mobile docs site.
Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:
This entire session should take about 30 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
Are you comfortable if I record and transcribe this session today for internal review purposes?
Are you ready to begin?

## Warm up questions - 5 minutes
1. What is your role at the VA? 

Lead UX Designer contractor at the VA. 


2. How familiar are you with the VA Mobile doc site? 

Fairly familiar, more familiar with the VA Design web 

3. How frequently do you interact with the site? 

Not that frequently, unless I’m working on a mobile feature. That ebbs and flows.

## Interview - 20 minutes
1. How did you first become aware of the VA Mobile Docs site?
- On the VA contract, as part of onboarding it was something I discovered. Not a part of onboarding, 2+years,  found it anyway because I sniffed out all things design. 

2. At what points in your mobile build process did you reference the site?
- Started once I took over updating the travel pay feature. I work for the travel pay team, originally the mobile team was doing the design. The previous contract started those designs, when that contract changed, even before that happened back in October they stopped due to business need changes. I had to bring all of the policy and feature things up to parody with what was going on web for mobile.
- Not right way then either, using what was in Figma. I wasn’t referencing the site to pull in components.
- Honestly, as the mobile I referenced it right way. Then more often while we started doing the build out. 

3. Can you describe your experience with the site?
- It’s challenging, because I feel like, for me, I wasn’t starting from scratch. 
- Times I just wanted to find is there guidance on this, or do I need to create a new thing. 
- I definitely want to use what exists. 
- Finding out to what level it does exist or if it doesn’t exist at all was daunting at times. 
- Created but not documented, discrepancy between what was on the site and what I was seeing things in Figma files
- Hard to navigate, not terribly, more highly opinionated in how one should interact with the design team.
- Should I be doing this and should I not be doing this. 
- I was allowed to come into the walled garden only to look but not to come into the garden.
- Lots of caveats to how you interact.


4. What are the main challenges you face when using the site?
- How buttons were aligned, different from what we were seeing in the file we were working with, different from the app and how the engineers were running the app.
- Let me figure out why they were like that, a reason, initiative in place but not sanctioned and not documented. 
- On the site, on the documentation, it aligns with what that is but why is the file different.
- When inheriting something there is a big discrepancy. To understand why it is different and where it is in the process of things.
- There isn’t a status of where things are.
- On the VA design system there is a deprecated, experimental, whatever. That is helpful, because if that’s not the case
- Find documentation about one button but not how things lay out together.
- Could be I wasn’t finding it but after a while
- There are foundational things and component level things, not stuff in between at a page levels or automatic. How things might work together.

5. What additional questions, if any, did you have after visiting the site?
- Honestly, when I come to the site, I think, is this accurate? What is the date on this, when was this last updated. 
- Having dates on here is helpful so I can know if this was updated 2 months ago or 2 years ago.
- A lot of getting started for designers and engineers, same struggle with VA design system
- Implementing a design system at a code base level not with designing in Figma
- Often when you start putting things together there is space for interpretation for what is based on the UX vs. the UI. Often the UX is missing.
- A pretty big gap between foundations, and then how you use it.
- The ethos, here’s the ethos, and here’s one specific word in our ethos.
- How do we tell the narrative and work that together.

6. How do you think the site can be improved to better support your needs?
- Whether it is the same site or not. I am confused by the discrepancies between the VA design system design.va.gov / this one is department of affairs.github.org
- They are 2 separate things. 
- I think they could live a little closer together.
- Just because that is my need, as I’m jumping back and forth between the two.
- They need to document more clearly when delineation should happen like notifications. 
- Accessibility could be slightly different between of tools that are used.
- Change of context when jumping back and forth. 
- Many times we are solving the same problem but now for two different experiences.
- Ex. travel pay an aspect that happens within appointments. If we are on an appointment detail view on web, it could be that travel pay service is done so we notify them. Still do all of your appointment stuff.
- Mobile, the whole view is that it is down for maintenance. Had to make some assumptions, parody what is happening on the web. 
- Same problem, solving it on two different platforms, they shouldn’t be that vastly different.
- If I’m solving something for web does it solve it for mobile
- Solving for mobile first would solve for the web experience. Like an MVP on how it should be for web.

7. Are there other sites you reference when building for mobile in your product?
- USWDS (they don’t have native aspects of it)
- Not fully baked in VA design or mobile design system
- Native, looks at material that has decent things that talk between the two. For the most part, native
- As designers, and people interacting with features for VA products, the collab cycle is something that is highly baked into the process. But with mobile, it is not part of that yet. Although, mobile team has been on some of those. 
- One thing that is still a little unclear. As there are products, where those touch points are, and how they fall in the governance on that.
- Same features but governance is different.
- How can we document that and get clarity of that.
- Documentation of governance as a whole.
- Getting started, or here’s how you work with the mobile design system. Different that how you use the VA web design system, having some parody between those two.
- Mobile team works with the VA design system to integrate that in the 
- Real unclear for somebody using it right now. 
- Longer that is unclear the more rogue features will go. 
- It is still a mystery, starting something new with mobile. 
- Whole element of many things are or were locked down. Do I work on this one thing I have access to or do I spin up a new thing?
- Naming of features or tickets, you don’t know about until you get in a meeting. 
- The more you can have decisions, even if they are in flux, documenthey are in flux. 
- This is fully baked do this, or this guidance 
- Rules vs. guidance
