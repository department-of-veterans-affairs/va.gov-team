# P5 Notes: VA Mobile Forms Exp. Team Interviews

## Intro - 5 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is Christine Julian. Today we're going to talk about the VA mobile docs site.
Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:
This entire session should take about 30 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.

1. Are you ok if I record this session for internal review?
2. Are you ready to begin?

## Warm up questions - 5 minutes
1. What is your role at the VA? 

UX designer for Mobile Features Support Team MFS


2. How familiar are you with the VA Mobile doc site? 

- Honestly, first came across it when joining back in Oct. Has quite a bit of different content on it now.
- There is a lot of content. A lot
- Slightly overwhelming, organized well.
- Brought on when previous team was still here, it was different then. Helpful for us, lots of different Figma links in there. 
- At that time, the Figma instance wasn’t even in VA.gov it was confusing to wrap my head around all of that. 
- Since it has been brought in (Figma links), it is more helpful.
- The permission table wasn’t on here before, the team members what they could see and what they could do is really nice.
- When first joined, the way the core mobile team was always a lot bigger, it wasn’t clear to me not having been on a mobile team before if I needed to get a local environment set up and how to actually do that, because that was under the engineering side.
- Confusing to know what all access I actually needed, a lot of things UX needs to know is under the different categories like QA and engineering. Hard to find that information and understand.
- Do we have a design library still? It would make sense to merge VADS, initially we were given some design system work to do too it was. 

3. How frequently do you interact with the site?
- Not super frequently, just because I didn’t realize updates were being made to it. Last time I looked, it was not the most helpful because stuff was clearly out of date.
- Now that I know it is being updated I’ll get in there more.

## Interview - 20 minutes
1. How did you first become aware of the VA Mobile Docs site?
- Back in Oct, when I onboarded. The program manager was sharing a bunch of helpful links, I was trying to get the lay of the land to understand what was built in the app. Coming in as a new designer, the way figma was set up before it wasn’t always clear what had been built in the app, the mobile doc site and finding the links to the figma mobile docs was crucial. 

2. At what points in your mobile build process did you reference the site?
- Stepping back, mobile build process. I have not actually set up my local environment yet. I have referenced it to understand the overall process and understanding the release process was clear as mud. Previously, not having worked on mobile teams we would just do rapid releases. The waiting game and Queing was brand new to me.
- Helpful to learn about the release process and how we were going to fit into that.

3. Can you describe your experience with the site?
- Even more error stuff on here that wasn’t on here before.
- I was waiting for it to be updated, not that it looks like it is. I am excited to see what all has changed there. 

4. What are the main challenges you face when using the site?
- Not totally knowing how experience teams fit into it. There was a contributing page we referenced quite a bit. It seemed like we were one of the first experience teams. 
- How we collaborate with the mobile team on the process, it seemed weird whenever mobile feature support was brought on. It seemed like people didn’t know what we were doing, if we were trying to take over. That was unclear how we were suppose to work with teams. Seeing the right up was definitely helpful, it has seemed like at the VA they don’t know what to do with the team. We’ve been all over the place, doing web stuff to. 

5. What additional questions, if any, did you have after visiting the site?
- I had lots of questions that whenever I had questions the teams had gone away. It was more so, around how we are actually working. Everything is documented, but actual working together is a whole other thing. Those were my biggest questions. 
- With the design system being unclear, what was going on with that. It wasn’t super clear are we suppose to be using, the way the Figma files were all structured there was tons of them. Are we suppose to be using the new mobile design library, the older library files, very weedy questions. I wasn’t really sure who to ask for that. There wasn’t anyone around.
- We ended up doing, I met with an engineer who gave me a one to one that I matched, and worked together as a team to figure it out. Look at what was existing in the code and recreate that.
- New veteran status card, we took that on and did the updates. Had to figure out which styles of text were used on the app to match to.

6. How do you think the site can be improved to better support your needs?
- I need to know it is updated.
- Did see, there is stuff for the branching. I’m looking forward to learning how that works, that seems super cool. 

7. Are there other sites you reference when building for mobile in your product?
- I look at Github, where all the research is. Product things from other VA.gov teams, I’m in Figma a lot. Looking at the other web designs implementing on mobile. Use ChatGPT to ask things, Mobbins for design reference. It costs, $10 per month but can see flows for a bunch of different apps without having to download. 

8. Anything additional to share?
- It has been nice having collaboration time, I’m excited to collaborate more and share more work in progress. I’m excited to work more with other designers since I’m the only designer on the team. I don’t have anything bad to say.
