# P1 Notes: VA Mobile Forms Exp. Team Interviews

## Intro - 5 minutes
## Warm up questions - 5 minutes
1. What is your role at the VA? 

Software engineer

2. How familiar are you with the VA Mobile doc site? 

I’ve been all over that. I’ve been using it for about a year and a half now.

3. How frequently do you interact with the site? 

It depends on what specifically I’m looking for. When I onboarded I read every single page, when I had a problem I would then go look at the doc site. I didn’t work on the mobile app for a good long while, now I’m back refreshing myself on how to set up your development environment and why you’re getting this error.

## Interview - 20 minutes
1. How did you first become aware of the VA Mobile Docs site? 

- Tim shared it with me as part of my onboarding.

2. At what points in your mobile build process did you reference the site?
- Referenced it a lot when I first started, downloaded the repo, got it up and running did the development on the local, from there it is when I’m adding something, check to see if it was covered in the doc. I’d ask a question in the slack site

3. Can you describe your experience with the site?

- I still had to ask a lot of follow questions. A lot of the time, the doc site was created when it was a core team that had always been on the app, if anything changed they’d do it internally but not go back and update the site.
- A lot of references and then do this but not explaining how.
- A lot of assumptions the doc assumed I knew how to do.

4. What are the main challenges you face when using the site?

- Outdated things
- Docs about adding the java home to your ZHRC file to your profile to pull into ISO and Android, the docs reference one version of Java then later referenced a different version of Java. 
- Inconsistencies about things that weren't updated everywhere when mentioned.

5. What additional questions, if any, did you have after visiting the site?

- If I couldn’t find what I was looking for, I’d ask in slack
- X code 15 update broke everything, there was a work around. I put it away and came back to it later, didn’t know if I still needed to do the workaround. Then the doc still referenced the outdated method even after dev team said it was fixed.
- Lots of questions about changes, outdated.
- Can’t sometimes find things
- Things may be located where I wouldn’t expect to find it
- If I follow the instructions on the doc site, sometimes they work and sometimes they don’t work 
- Ask questions posted in the VA mobile app or mobile app engineering DSVA slack channels.
- API docs are way less helpful than the front end docs, the front end docs are more fully flushed out.
- API docs say do this but there is the how and where questions.

6. How do you think the site can be improved to better support your needs?

- A lot of information is dated and outdated
- Have a front-end engineer sit down and review relevant documentation to be up-to-date
- SME from each practice area review the site, do an audit to ensure it is all up to date
- There isn’t a feedback option on the site (hey I was on this page and looking for this information and I couldn’t find it). Like the main VA platform docs do, mobile doesn’t have this.

7. Are there other sites you reference when building for mobile in your product?

- Not really
- Reference platform documentation for back end, all in the same monolith, mobile is it’s own little module inside of the VETS API
- Mobile is different, no where else to reference

8. Anything else to mention? No, having an audit done yearly to update information.
-That’s been really frustrating for me, it says use Java 15, but I am running 17 I am so confused why is this not working, I don’t know. I feel bad bugging somebody about it. Here’s the doc site, yeah but I dont’ understand how it works. I feel like I’m pulling somebody from their duties to update.

- Works on the Travel Pay team, has been working with mobile for awhile. Yes and no, on the team as the mobile engineer. Just doing mobile, transitioned back to web, Everyone puts mobile down for awhile and picked it back up.

- Worked on another contract, doing some mobile. 

- The docs would help folks. The platform documentation is well established detailed on how to do things, lots of different channels to ask for help. The mobile is its own separate thing. I feel bad asking for help, everyone on that team has their regular day jobs to help me figure out why my app isn’t running.

- Adding a troubleshooting guide. Try this, common things that trip you up when you’re first starting.
