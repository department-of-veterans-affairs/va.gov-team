# Additional considerations

> **Note** Pages should never be blank or only redirect to another source. Instead, content on a page may direct to another source. Previously many pages acted solely as navigation folders. Our new design simplifies the navigation structure so that higher category pages hold the most important content or act as a table of contents with sub-categories on the page.
