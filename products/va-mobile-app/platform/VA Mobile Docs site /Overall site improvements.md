# Overall Site Improvements: VA Mobile Doc Site

## Site design
### Site structure
1. Simplify site IA. 
2. Remove role specific areas and base structure on where the user is in their process (onboarding/intro, getting started, developing for mobile, getting support).
> P1 [engineer] Things may be located where I wouldn’t expect to find it.
3. Implement a consistent menu structure
> P3 [designer]  I wonder why you are using the side bars as the main nav. 
> P5 [designer]  Maybe instead of documentation, if I look at it I wouldn’t guess there is so much stuff in there. Remove that out from the nav side bar and put that as main nav instead of side nav, would be helpful for others to find things.
> P3 [designer] Documentation and design system, I’m remembering when I first used it I went to documentation to look for what would happen in the design system. Then I didn’t really see the design system later, when I couldn't find the components and their documentation then I went into the design system.
> P2 [designer] Hard to navigate.
> P5 [designer]  Remember having trouble finding navigation and some interactive principles, I don’t think it's there even today.
> P5 [designer] Some of the information I needed to find wasn’t located under UX it was under engineering somewhere so I had to spend some time looking around.
### Site features
1. Add timestamps or history log
2. Add status
3. Add FAQ section
4. Add troubleshooting guide
5. Ai search or chatbot
6. Improve search capability
> P2 [designer] Finding out to what level it does exist or if it doesn’t exist at all was daunting at times.
> P4 [engineer] Trying to search for things in general, it is very hit or miss. Sometimes it just nails it, or other times I find myself digging.
7. Feedback submissions:Any user can submit a PR 
> P1 [engineer] There isn’t a feedback option on the site (hey I was on this page and looking for this information and I couldn’t find it). Like the main VA platform docs do, mobile doesn’t have this.
> P6 [engineer] It’s probably in there somewhere but if we don’t we should call out that any engineer, or anybody that is using the site and sees something out of date or should be added to is free to submit PRs and here’s how we do it.

### Site content
1. Update content
*   Content audit by SMEs
*   Assign SMEs to review existing content for accuracy
    - Front end engineer: Tim and benny review
    -  Back end engineer: Ryan Svlvio and Tim (in progress)
    - QA (recently done some work, tickets created for updating QA content) Done by Sam and Ken
    - Designer: Jonathan Post
2. Content rewritten w/ a single voice
    - Tim Wright
3. Reframe content to assist experience team users
> P1 [engineer] Seems like it was written for a different audience. Created when it was primarily for the core team before other experience teams really started using the site.
>
> P4 [engineer] What is your target audience? Tailoring your experience based off the target audience. A lot of really broad strokes.
>
> P2 [designer]  ”It was like I was allowed to come into the walled garden only to look but not to come into the garden.”
4. Clarify rules vs. guidance
> P2 [designer] Need better distinction of Rules vs. guidance
5. Define the mobile experience governance process
6. Integrate more holistically in the Platform Collab. Cycle for governance
7. Imbed mobile more in the Platform collab. Cycle
> P2 [designer] Mobile platform doesn’t feel baked into the collab cycle fully.  Same features but governance is different.
> P5 [designer]  Went to Jonathan Post first to answer my questions. Then went to mobile team office hours, found out through Jonathan. Was able to get my questions answered.

### Move design system to VADS
1. After reviewing content, update all design system elements/content to be current.
2. Schedule intake meeting with VADS about transfer of information.
3. Help facilitate transfer of information to VADS.
4. Create a regular maintenance schedule.
