# Mobile Login Research

## Purpose
The VA Health & Benefits app team is researching login issues to better understand root causes of common mobile login issues. Through this research the team also intends to further explore app improvements that may improve the login experience. Login related issues are the #1 reported issue for the VHB app and the team would like to gather more data around Veteran specific issues to improve the app functionality. To gather this data, the team is exploring providing an opportunity for Veterans to report their issues related to login from directly within the app sign in page. 

## Goals of this research:
1. Identify root cause of Veteran issues related to logging in from the mobile app.
2. Identify root cause of why some Veterans experience app preformance issues.
3. Evalute priority and feasibility of Veteran login needs/requests.

### Reported Veteran Issues
As specifically mentioned during mobile Q2 in-app reviews analysis.
1. Many password requirements.
2. Passcodes do not come in time.
3. Frequent logouts.
4. Unable to get authenticated.
5. Challenges with accessing the app from a remote area due to weak signal.

### Veteran requests
As specifically mentioned during mobile Q2 in-app reviews analysis.
1. Single access point or passcode.
2. Remain logged in, unless I log out.
3. Remain logged in, even after the app is updated.
4. Remember device option to work as expected.
5. Be able to login to the app even in low signal areas without waiting for security codes.

## Methodology
In-app reporting (report an issue link for feedback from Veterans).

### Intent
The intent of this feature is to collect Veteran feedback related to login issues specifically and capture what available data can be automatically (and legally) captured about the device to help the mobile app team better identify potential root causes that could result in these login errors being triggered. No tickets will be created or responses sent back to the Veterans, rather this will act as a channel for Veterans to communicate about their experience allowing for the Veterans voice to be heard.

### Timing
Target state date: TBD based on feasibility
Target end date: For the purposes of this login study we will review responses over a 2 week period of time from launch date.

### Location of Link
In a team meeting 7-21-25 it was determined that the only available screen the mobile app team owned to directly incorporate this submit feedback link was the initial app screen that prompts the user to select 'Sign in'. Since the Veteran may experience issues during any point of the process, and the process being in a web view between VA.gov and Id.me or Login.gov then it was determined that the user would likely revisit this screen after encountering a problem.
