## 10/12/23
*   Discuss Review/Feedback process (based on Service Blueprint work)
     -  How and where and who do we want to have a review/approval process?
     -  Use Cases that could differ:
        -   Non-flagship VA team adding functionality to the Flagship app
            -   Flagship Product group, Ryan would review (smallest number possible)
        -   Non-flagship VA team building a new app
            -   Less governance needed
     -   We definitely want some sort of review
*   Discuss QA process/Release Mgmt strategy
    -   non-flagship VA teams submitting PRs for QA testing
        -   size of the PR not equivalent to QA effort
        -   How can we effectively set expectations for QA time?
        -   Could/should non-flagship teams write their own tests not maintained by the Flagship team?
            -  Yes please.  Definitely unit tests, ideally E2E tests as well.  We would want them to watch if their merge breaks tests not related to their functionality as well.
        -   Non-flagship teams should do their own QA, but also the Shared Services QA team would need to sign off prior to merging their feature branches
