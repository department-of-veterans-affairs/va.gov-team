# Flagship Mobile App Platform Components

The term "platform" is overloaded and means different things in different contexts and to different people.  This document enumerates the processes and technology that make up the Flagship Mobile App and group them into areas that must be owned by the core mobile team, those that will probably belong to the core mobile time for the near future and those that can be owned by experience teams.


## Platform Components

These are things that _must_ be owned by the core mobile team.  Note that these things require the core mobile team have both frontend _and_ backend engineering expertise.

- Apple and Google developer accounts
- Apple and Google app store listings
- management of the [va-mobile-app](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app) repo
- management of the mobile API module in the [vets-api](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/tree/master/modules/mobile) repo
- build and CI pipelines
- internal build distribution (e.g. TestFlight)
- demo mode app infrastructure
- app and mobile API quality assurance
- bug and crash triage
- app release management

    * (ensure that teams are not abusing network bandwidth, battery, notifications, etc.)

- mobile design & eng collab cycle oversight


## Core Mobile Team Components

These are things that _could_ be owned by other teams in the future but will probably belong to the core mobile team for the time being.

- the mobile design system
- mobile content
- mobile information architecture
- UI test automation
- final code review
- overall mobile analytics
- app store reviews management
- FeedbackHub (app store review and Reddit scraper)
- login flow

- profile view


## Experience Components

These are things that can be owned by experience teams, but will default to the core mobile team when experience teams lack mobile development capacity.
