> [raw data is available separately](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/edit/master/products/va-mobile-app/platform/platform-surveys/2025-baseline-raw-data.md)

## Methodology
- The survey was designed to establish baseline metrics for how well we're meeting the needs of teams building features on the VAHB app and to support the prioritization of effors to close any identify gaps
- The survey was anonymous and open to VA and contract team members of any practice (design/research, engineering, and product) and all teams, including Core Mobile, MFS, Feature teams building on the app, and Feature teams collaborating with Core Mobile or MFS to build features
- Participants were recruited through Slack messages in general mobile and feature team specific channels, and in direct messages to the VA Product Owners and contract Product Managers of the various teams

## Survey overview
- The survey launched September 30, 2025 and was closed October 27, 2025. 
- 14 of 34 (41%) participants completed, 20 abandoned.
  - We note the low participation rate and believe the timing relative to the lapse in government appropriations and other Platform surveys may have impacted participation
- median completion time: 15:47

## Participant summary

- The participant group is relatively new to the platform, with over 90% of respondents indicateing experience of a year or less. Only one respondent reported experience of 2 years or more.
- Most respondents (6) came from the Engineering practice, followed by UX (Design/research) (5) and product, (3). 
- The survey captured responses across the mobile teams. 43% (6) of participants represented Experience teams, with 29% (4) from each Mobile Feature Support and Core Mobile. 

**Highlights** 
The following themes were identified in the responses to the question, "What has been the smoothest part of your experience building on the VAHB app?" (14 responses)
- positive collaboration with the mobile team
  - "Core Mobile team members have been great to work with when building features on the app"
- quick and effective communication 
  - "We work closely and collaboratively with MFS. We have great communication."
  - "The team is friendly and generally responsive in Slack when I ask questions". Participant 34 also appreciated the "quick comms w/ members of the team".
- well-defined requirements streamline the development process
  - "Whenever features have fully fleshed out AC and no further questions were needed". This suggests that clear requirements documentation significantly improves the development workflow.
- The availability of quality code examples is a valuable reference for developers
  - "There's lots of code that provides a good example of best practices"
- Automation in the development workflow was appreciated by some participants.

**Decision making**
- Most participants feel comfortable with their decision-making authority, with 57% of respondents strongly or somewhat agreeing with their decision-making authority, suggesting that the current level of autonomy meets the needs of most team members.
- Opportunities related to decision-making authority include
  - a need for more data-backed decision making processes, such as "more user research to gather data from to support or inform decisions"
  - a desire for clarity around decision ownership and authority
    - Example response: "Right now it feels like any decision must be approved by another team and my role is more to manage what decisions have beenmade and help unblock folks that need decisions from other teams."
    - Example response: "I've been getting conflicting messaging on what we can/can't change in the app."
    - Example response: "I feel like I'm not getting the proper feedback at the right times which has led to confusion and rework."
  - better cross-team communication and alignment to align on decisions and resolve challenges with cross-team coordination and alignment on project decisions (21%)
    - Example response: "I would like to see clear timelines and details about the status of their work. It would be great if there were touchpoints/ an approval process where the product team who is responsible for the overall experience across web + mobile are brought up to speed can confirm thatthe direction is inline with what is live on the web and can resolve any confusion."
  - A need for deeper product knowledge to inform their decisions (14%)
- 9 of the 14 (64%) respondents indicated they strongly or somewhat understand the decision criteria for features being built.  

**Confidence**
- Most respondents (64%) are able to self-serve and find answers independently.
- 71% of respondents are neutral or uncertain about the relationship between Platform collab cycle and their work on the VAHB app
- Most respondents generally feel equipped to deliver Veteran VAHB app experiences aligned with standards, though 57% express only moderate confidence and 29% remain neutral about having sufficient knowledge and support.

## Mobile platform specific insights
The following analysis is based on responses to questions presented exclusively to those who indicated they are members of the Core Mobile team (4 respondents)
- All Core Mobile team respondents feel supported in their role.
- Some Core Mobile team members dedicate substantial portions of their time to supporting other teams. 2 indicated they support other teams 26-50% of the time, 1 spending 51-75%.
- 3 of 4 Core Mobile respondents reported 10% or less of their time is spent on Platform tasks like infrastructure, documentation, or monitoring. 
- The Core Mobile team most frequently provides support in one of the following categories: engineering, analytics, documentation, design, and release process.

## Experience team specific insights
The following analysis is based on responses to questions presented exclusively to those who indicated they are members of MFS or an Experience team (10 respondents)

**Onboarding**
- Half of the respondents (4) went through Mobile onboarding.
  - Of the 4 respondents, only 1 indicated that onboarding prepared them somewhat well to be successful building on the VAHB app. The others (3) were neutral. 
- 50% of participants mentioned issues with missing or outdated documentation during onboarding.
  - Example response: "I came in about a year ago, and a lot of things were out of date. I know there have been lots of improvements, but there's still quite a bit of stuff missing in the documentation."
  - Example response: "I don't think at the time of my onboarding I was presented with mobile docs. The only thing I was aware of was the Release schedule."
- 50% of participants experienced confusion or difficulties getting started with the system.
 - Example response: "some minor confusion on how to get up and running with everything"
- Participants expressed a desire for more structured onboarding information at the beginning of projects and clearer documentation on where to find important resources.
  - Example response: "Perhaps a kickoff info call explaining the features to be build, how long term support will work, and how to manage changes and drift between the two would have been nice up front"

**Support and feedback**
- Most respondents feel confident about engaging the Mobile team regarding new VAHB app features, with 80% indicating strong to moderate agreement. 1 strongly disagreed.
- 90% of team members express confidence in knowing how to get support from the Core Mobile team.
- 60% of respondents find Mobile team feedback to be 'Mostly' clear and 40% report the feedback is 'Mostly' consistent from one interaction with the Mobile team to another.
- 50% rate the Core Mobile team feedback as 'Mostly' or 'Very' consistent with feedback from others outside the Mobile team (i.e., Platform, CoP, or Collab cycle)
- 50% of respondents are neutral about whether Mobile team feedback consistently follows documented standards. 40% believe it 'Mostly' does.

**Design**
- Survey responses indicate there is a need for more consistent design and development standards across the platform.
- Participants expressed frustration with managing conflicting feedback or navigating separate and contradictory feedback channels and the need to revise designs as a result 
  - Example response: "stuck in a loop where we took what the Collab Cycle told us to do, which aligned with best practices for web. When we met with the Core Mobile team UX, they provided different guidance".     - Example response: "Right now, it feels like our team has to go through the collab cycle and then a mobile design process. These processes at times conflict with one another. I wish that we were given feedback from the collab cycle from the Mobile experts, and that we didn't have to manage various feedback and try to sort out which feedback we need to adhere to. One improvement is if Mobile experts were providing feedback on our designs during Design Intent and Midpoint Review, as well as Mobile engineers were providing feedback during Architecture Intent. This could help our team avoid conflicting feedback, as we would expect to get the source of truth from those individuals."

**Development**
- 40% of respondents somewhat understand the prioritization of features. The remaining 6 respondents expressed neutral or significant uncertainty. 
- 50% have significant uncertainty in knowing how to track the progress of a new request or feature in development.
- Only 10% of team members feel fully confident in understanding their role in the development process. 40% have significant uncertainty. 
- Participants wished they had known earlier about the differences between mobile app standards and web experience
  - Example response: "I think it would be helpful to develop processes, such as a product playbook, for the mobile app. All of these items that we are being asked to do on the web should be ideally have a process for mobile. This could also help the Collab Cycle team provide guidance for teams building on the mobile app."
  - - Several participants indicated they lacked awareness of documentation resources or best practices for development
- Participants highlighted the need for more comprehensive testing capabilities to ensure all scenarios can be properly evaluated.
  - Example response: "We need better staging users and documentation for testing so we can test through all scenarios. It would also be nice if you could clone and create our own staging users."
- Responses expressed desire for best practices, such as "accessibility standards specific to the mobile app", "debugging with React Native", and "local api testing"

**Post-release**
- 40% of respondents were slightly or significantly uncertain about the steps between development and release and their role during that phase. An additional 20% were netral in their understanding.
- Participants indicated confusion about processes, responsibilities, and expectations, especially after release
  - 30% of team members somewhat understand what is expected of their team related to post-release analytics and monitoring. 40% have significant uncertainty. 
- Most team members struggle to find Veteran feedback and data related to their features, with 50% expressing low to no confidence in their ability to locate this information.

### Opportunities 
Based on survey responses, focusing on the following areas will have the greatest value for both the Core Mobile team and for teams building on the VAHB app 
- Enhancements to onboarding, such as closing documentation gaps, adding/improving documentation on best practices, accessibility standards, and information about the differences between building on web and mobile
  - Beyond onboarding, the initiation of a new feature/project could be another valuable time to review the development process, expectations, available developer tools, and documentation
- Streamlining collab cycle and mobile processes and embedding mobile expertise to ensure feedback is consolidated into a single channel and consistent with mobile experience standards
- Auditing existing documentation for accuracy and broadening topic coverage, such as analytics, unified standards, and reusable components
- Increase visibility into development cycle, from prioritization through post-release 

**Other suggestions**
- "Would love to be able to connect a date log of found issues and resolutions deployed to cross reference with app review dates so we can see possible correlations or causation between feedback and found issues."
