# Platform Survey - 2025 Baseline

## Methodology
- survey was designed to help us understand how well we're meeting the needs of teams building features on the VAHB app and to establish baseline metrics
- survey was anonymous and open to
  - VA and contract team members
  - all practices (design/research, engineering, and product)
  - all teams, including Core Mobile, MFS, Feature teams building on the app, and Feature teams collaborating with Core Mobile or MFS to build features
- participants were recruited through Slack messages in general mobile and feature team specific channels, and in direct messages to the VA Product Owners and contract Product Managers of the various teams

## Survey overview
- Survey launched September 30, 2025 and closed October 27, 2025 (_lapse in appropriations began October 1 and likely impacted participation_)
- 14 of 34 (41%) participants completed, 20 abandoned.
- median completion time: 15:47

## Participant overview 

**Summary**
- representing questions 1,2, and 5, 14 respondents
- The participant group was relatively new to the platform, with over 90% of respondents indicateing experience of a year or less. Only one respondent indicated VAHB app experience of 2 years or more.
- Most respondents (6) came from the Engineering practice, followed by UX (Design/research) (5). 3 respondents were from the Product practice. 
- The survey captured responses from a diverse mix of mobile team roles.

**Decision-making authority**
- representing questions 3 and 4, 14 respondents
- 57% of respondents strongly or somewhat agreed with their decision-making authority, suggesting that the current level of autonomy meets the needs of most team members.
- 36% had a neutral opinion on their level of autonomy. Only 1 expressed disagreement. 
- Pain points, expressed in free-text feedback to the question, "What do you wish were different about your ability to make decisions?" (12 responses)
  - A need for more data-backed decision making processes (2/12)
  - A need to understand who has final decision-making authority in their projects (3/12) 
  - A need to improve communication between teams to align on decisions and resolve challenges with cross-team coordination and alignment on project decisions (2/12) 
  - A need for deeper product knowledge to inform their decisions (2/12)
  
**Confidence**
- representing questions 23-26, 14 respondents
- Most respondents (64%) are able to self-serve and find answers independently.
- Only 21% indicate strong understanding of the decision criteria for features being built.
- 71% of respondents are neutral or uncertain about the relationship between Platform collab cycle and their work on the VAHB app
- Most respondents generally feel equipped to deliver Veteran VAHB app experiences aligned with standards, though 57% express only moderate confidence and 29% remain neutral about having sufficient knowledge and support.

## Highlights and opportunities

### What is going well?
14 responded to the question, "What has been the smoothest part of your experience building on the VAHB app?"

Highlights include
- positive collaboration with the mobile team
  - "Core Mobile team members have been great to work with when building features on the app"
- quick and effective communication 
  - "The team is friendly and generally responsive in Slack when I ask questions". Participant 34 also appreciated the "quick comms w/ members of the team".
- well-defined requirements streamline the development process
  - "Whenever features have fully fleshed out AC and no further questions were needed". This suggests that clear requirements documentation significantly improves the development workflow.
- The availability of quality code examples is a valuable reference for developers
  - "There's lots of code that provides a good example of best practices"
- Automated releases were cited as the smoothest part by a few respondents

### Opportunities for improvement
Analysis based on free text responses to the questions, "What do you wish you had known earlier about building on the VAHB app?" and "If we could improve one thing about your experience building for the VAHB app, what would it be?" (14 responses to each)
- Several participants indicated they lacked awareness of documentation resources or best practices for development
- Participants indicated confusion about processes, responsibilities, and expectations, especially after release 
- Participants wished they had known earlier about the differences between mobile app standards and web experience
- Some expressed frustration about having to revise designs after receiving conflicting guidance.
  - "stuck in a loop where we took what the Collab Cycle told us to do, which aligned with best practices for web. When we met with the Core Mobile team UX, they provided different guidance".
- Multiple participants expressed a desire for more information about accessibility standards specific to the mobile app
- Participants expressed frustration with managing conflicting feedback between the collab cycle and mobile design processes and navigating separate feedback channels that sometimes contradict each other.
  - "Right now, it feels like our team has to go through the collab cycle and then a mobile design process. These processes at times conflict with one another. I wish that we were given feedback from the collab cycle from the Mobile experts, and that we didn't have to manage various feedback and try to sort out which feedback we need to adhere to. One improvement is if Mobile experts were providing feedback on our designs during Design Intent and Midpoint Review, as well as Mobile engineers were providing feedback during Architecture Intent. This could help our team avoid conflicting feedback, as we would expect to get the source of truth from those individuals."
  - "I think it would be helpful to develop processes, such as a product playbook, for the mobile app. All of these items that we are being asked to do on the web should be ideally have a process for mobile. This could also help the Collab Cycle team provide guidance for teams building on the mobile app."
- Participants highlighted the need for more comprehensive testing capabilities to ensure all scenarios can be properly evaluated.
 - "We need better staging users and documentation for testing so we can test through all scenarios. It would also be nice if you could clone and create our own staging users." 
- Participants expressed a desire for more structured onboarding information at the beginning of projects and clearer documentation on where to find important resources.
  - "Perhaps a kickoff info call explaining the features to be build, how long term support will work, and how to manage changes and drift between the two would have been nice up front" 
- There appears to be a need for more consistent design and development standards across the platform.
  - "unified standards and reusable components" and "More focus on platform related priorities"
- "I think it would be helpful to develop processes, such as a product playbook, for the mobile app. All of these items that we are being asked to do on the web should be ideally have a process for mobile. This could also help the Collab Cycle team provide guidance for teams building on the mobile app.
- "Would love to be able to connect a date log of found issues and resolutions deployed to cross reference with app review dates so we can see possible correlations or causation between feedback and found issues."
