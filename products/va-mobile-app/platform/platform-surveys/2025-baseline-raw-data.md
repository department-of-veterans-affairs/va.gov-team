### Question 4 
What do you wish were different about your ability to make decisions? (Multi-line text)
- 12 of 14 participants 

- "Being more informed, know the product more in detail"
- "Our team is unique that we don't own the features we are building, nor havefinal control of the app. Right now it feels like any decision must be approvedby another team and my role is more to manage what decisions have beenmade and help unblock folks that need decisions from other teams."
- "More user research to gather data from to support or inform decisions."
- "Keep consistent patterns"
- "Wish decisions were more data backed than contract backed"
- "I've just begun my work with the Mobile team, and things have been goingsmoothly; I am optimistic about our working relationship."
- "Since MFS is building I would like to see clear timelines and details about the status of their work. It would be great if there were touchpoints/ an approval process where the product team who is responsible for the overall experience across web + mobile are brought up to speed can confirm that the direction is inline with what is live on the web and can resolve any confusion."
- "Do not wish anything different"
- "No wish to make anything different"
- "I've been getting conflicting messaging on what we can/can't change in the app. I've been told the other team owns the content and we're just implementing the product for them on the app, and that content needs to align from most people except Ryan. Additionally, all feedback must be documented in order to act on it, and we've received no written feedback from Core Mobile so far, but have received feedback from governance that contradicts guidance from Core Mobile. I feel like I'm not getting the proper feedback at the right times which has led to confusion and rework."
- "Understanding the why to things are the way they are"
- "that i understood who else i should consult with in order to make the decisions"

### Question 27 
What has been the smoothest part of your experience building on the VAHB app?
- 13 out of 14 participants

- "I haven't build on the VAHB app but work closely and collaboratively with the MFS. We have great communication."
- "Core Mobile team members have been great to work with when building features on the app."
- "Building off existing knowledge, processes, or the collaborative nature of the team providing support and direction for a new team member."
- "Whenever features have fully fleshed out AC and no further questions were needed"
- "automated releases"
- "I haven't finished my build yet."
- "The collaboration with MFS Team."
- "mobile team has been good to work with"
- "I am not building on the VAHB app. Just supporting the team"
- "There's lots of code that provides a good example of best practices"
- "It's been great to meet with Ryan and the Core Mobile UX team. The team is friendly and generally responsive in Slack when I ask questions."
- "Getting the dev environment set up"
- "quick comms w/ members of the team"

### Question 28 
What do you wish you had known earlier about building on the VAHB app?
- 13 out of 14 participants

- We got stuck in a loop where we took what the Collab Cycle told us to do,which aligned with best practices for web. When we met with the Core Mobile team UX, they provided different guidance, and so we had to go back and make changes to our design. I wish it were clearer what mobile app standards will differ from the web experience, including accessibility, whenwe began our first design iteration for mobile."
- "its not clear to me how support for the mobile app feature set is to be managed"
- "I wish there were more documentation on best practices for debugging with React Native"
- "All of the processes needed to change something in the design system"
- "Best standards for writing tests"
- "that the documentation site existed"

### Question 29 
If we could improve one thing about your experiencebuilding for the VAHB app, what would it be?
- 9 out of 14 participants

- "Right now, it feels like our team has to go through the collab cycle and then a mobile design process. These processes at times conflict with one another. I wish that we were given feedback from the collab cycle from the Mobile experts, and that we didn't have to manage various feedback and try to sort out which feedback we need to adhere to. One improvement is if Mobile experts were providing feedback on our designs during Design Intent and Midpoint Review, as well as Mobile engineers were providing feedback during Architecture Intent. This could help our team avoid conflicting feedback, as we would expect to get the source of truth from those individuals."
- "More focus on platform related priorities."
- "So far so good!"
- "unified standards and reusable components"
- "perhaps a kickoff info call explaining the features to be build, how long term support will work, and how to manage changes and drift between the tw owould have been nice up front"
- "We need better staging users and documentation for testing so we can test through all scenarios. It would also be nice if you could clone and create our own staging users."
- "Help vetting collab cycle feedback that contradicts mobile's stance and receiving written feedback from Core Mobile throughout the process"
- "Better local api testing support"
- "knowing where to look for for tickets"

### Question 30 
Is there anything else you think we should know?
- 6 out of 14 participants

- "We are working closely with the MFS team to ensure consistency with the desktop VA website"
- "I think it would be helpful to develop processes, such as a product playbook,for the mobile app. All of these items that we are being asked to do on the web should be ideally have a process for mobile. This could also help the Collab Cycle team provide guidance for teams building on the mobile app."
- "Would love to be able to connect a date log of found issues and resolutions deployed to cross reference with app review dates so we can see possible correlations or causation between feedback and found issues."
- "Doing a great job, feel supported all around!"
- "Excited for the future and happy to be a part of it! Happy to help in any way we can."
- "Nope"
