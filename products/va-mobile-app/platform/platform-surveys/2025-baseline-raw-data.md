Question 4: 
What do you wish were different about your ability to make decisions? (Multi-line text)
- 12 of 14 participants 

Theme: A need for more data-backed decision making processes
  - More user research to gather data from to support or inform decisions.
  - Wish decisions were more data backed than contract backed

Theme: A need to understand who has final decision-making authority in their projects
- I've been getting conflicting messaging on what we can/can't change in the app. I've been told the other team owns the content and we're just implementing the product for them on the app, and that content needs to align from most people except Ryan. Additionally, all feedback must be documented in order to act on it, and we've received no written feedback from Core Mobile so far, but have received feedback from governance that contradicts guidance from Core Mobile. I feel like I'm not getting the proper feedback at the right times which has led to confusion and rework.
- Understanding the why to things are the way they are
- that i understood who else i should consult with in order to make the decisions

Theme: A need to improve communication between teams to align on decisions and resolve challenges with cross-team coordination and alignment on project decisions
  - Since MFS is building I would like to see clear timelines and details about the status of their work. It would be great if there were touchpoints/ an approval process where the product team who is responsible for the overall experience across web + mobile are brought up to speed can confirm that the direction is inline with what is live on the web and can resolve any confusion.
  - Our team is unique that we don't own the features we are building, nor have final control of the app. Right now it feels like any decision must be approved by another team and my role is more to manage what decisions have been made and help unblock folks that need decisions from other teams.
  
Theme: A need for deeper product knowledge to inform their decisions
  - Being more informed, know the product more in detail
  - Keep consistent patterns

Other responses
  - I've just begun my work with the Mobile team, and things have been going smoothly; I am optimistic about our working relationship.
  - Do not wish anything different
  - No wish to make anything different
