## Research Goals
The key objective of this study is to evaluate the usability of completing a VA form in a webview from the VA Health and Benefits app. Additionally, the research aims to uncover the following:

1. Understand if Veterans using screen reader or screen magnifier technology can find and interact with forms from the app.
2. Identify if Veterans using screen reader or screen magnifier technology can fill out a form from the app on their own.
3. Identify if Veterans using screen reader or screen magnifier technology can start a form and come back to it at a later time to complete.

This research can impact Veterans across many phases of the Veteran journey from Getting out to Death
[See the Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)  

**Guiding Questions:**  
- What are the key moments this tool supports in the Veteran’s journey?  
- The results of the study will help us determine if Veterans who rely on assistive technology, specifically screen readers and screen magnifiers, are able to fill out and complete forms from the mobile app. This will inform future form development on the app. 



## Research Questions

**Research goal #1: Understand if Veterans using screen reader or screen magnifier technology can find and interact with forms from the app.**

- Veterans using a screen reader or screen magnifer will be able to easily locate the forms section within the mobile app without extensive guidance.
- Veterans will be able to follow the intended navigation steps to start a new form from within the app.

**Research goal #2: Identify if Veterans using screen reader or screen magnifier technology can fill out a form from the app on their own.**

- Most Veterans using a screen reader or screen magnifer will be able to independently complete all required fields in a form using the mobile app.

**Research goal #3: Identify if Veterans using screen reader or screen magnifier technology can start a form and come back to it at a later time to complete.**

- Veterans using a screen reader or screen magnifer will be able to locate and resume a form they previously started within the mobile app.


## Methodology 

- Method 1: Moderated usability study (remote)


## Hypotheses and Conclusions

**Hypothesis Statement:**

**Research goal #1: Understand if Veterans using screen reader or screen magnifier technology can find and interact with forms from the app.**

- Veterans using a screen reader or screen magnifer will be able to easily locate the forms section within the mobile app without extensive guidance.

**Likely false.** The majority of our study participants went first to claims to find or create a claim to submit a statement to. 

- Veterans will be able to follow the intended navigation steps to start a new form from within the app.

**Likely false.** Veterans struggled to navigate to the 'Go to my forms' area from the homepage looking first to claims, and then also from the 'What would you like to do' screen. This this screen created more confusion or doubt that they were in the right place to submit their statment.

**Research goal #2: Identify if Veterans using screen reader or screen magnifier technology can fill out a form from the app on their own.**

- Most Veterans using a screen reader or screen magnifer will be able to independently complete all required fields in a form using the mobile app.

**Likely true.** Although improvements to specific form fields would make it a better experience for assistive technology users, participants were able to complete the fields on their mobile device on their own.

**Research goal #3: Identify if Veterans using screen reader or screen magnifier technology can start a form and come back to it at a later time to complete.**

- Veterans using a screen reader or screen magnifer will be able to locate and resume a form they previously started within the mobile app.

**Likely true.** Veterans were able to easily continue their started forms in the app. 


## Key Findings

**1.** AT users had mixed feelings about the process of completing forms in the app. ​

**2.** Veterans expect to find statements in support of a claim under the claims section of the app. ​

**3.** The 'What would you like to do?' screen created more doubt to Veterans that they were in the right place to submit their statement in support of a claim. ​

**4.** Veterans struggle to return to the app from webview. Veterans are not aware that they are on a webview instead of the app. ​  

**5.** Typing is frustrating for AT users especially on smaller devices, however mobile devices offer easier ways to complete fields.

**6.** Statuses are unclear both about the form and app form tabs 'active/complete'.​



## Details of Findings 

**1.** AT users had mixed feelings about the process of completing forms in the app. ​
- 5 respondents felt positive about the process of completing a form in the app. Noting it was simple, easy, or exciting. Expressing feeling good about their abilities to do it themselves.​

​>“It’s easy. You don’t want to have to drive to a location 30 miles away and do it in person. You can do it right there at your kitchen table. And it’s convenient. It’s fast, it’s easy, it’s convenient.” - Participant 2​
<br>​

- 5 respondents felt that improvements would make this feature more desirable. Including:​
1. Pre-filled form fields​
2. Simple, clear content improvements​
3. An app-based layout (vs. Web-view)​
4. Consistent navigation​
​
​
>"I'm hoping because it's my app it automatically fills in some of the data that it knows. - Like, here, you know, read it, tap it, sign it, boom. Like, that'd be really cool.” - Participant 4​

<br>

**2.** Veterans expect to find statements in support of a claim under the claims section of the app. ​

- 5 participants would navigate to 'Claims' w/ 2 participant navigating to ‘Benefits Tab > Claims'.​
- 3 participants looked first for an area called ‘Forms’.​
- 5 Veteran look to start a claim before they submit a statement and expect submit a statement to be an option within a claim similar to submitting evidence. They often conflated the two tasks during the study.

>"You know, if I’m given a directive to, okay, go find where you would submit this form. That’s not hard to do but that was probably the hardest part of it.” - Participant 2​

<br>

**3.** The 'What would you like to do?' screen created more doubt to Veterans that they were in the right place to submit their statement in support of a claim. ​

- For AT users specifically this page is dense and required more time to review than all other pages for this form. All users reviewed the options multiple times and some noted the options were not clear.​
- 3 participants could not launch the form on their own due to confusion selecting various options on this screen.​
- 4 participants selected multiple options having to return to this page several times before finding an option that launched the desired form.

>"I think that…being very clear with your descriptions, what I need to click on. And having that block where I can enter in that statement will… should be, identified much better than what it is." - Participant 1

<br>

**4.** Veterans struggle to return to the app from webview. Veterans are not aware that they are on a webview instead of the app. ​  

- AT users expect the navigation bars to remain consistent throughout the entire process to help orient themself.​
- Device settings such as font size increase, and dark mode don't transfer between the app and the webview.  ​
- When the bottom navigation bar changed in webview users struggled to find their way back to the app. ​
- 4 users tried the back arrows which kept them stuck on the webview unable to get out of the form.​
- 4 users looked first for the Home icon in the bottom navigation bar being unable to find it. ​
- 2 users tried to click on the VA in the middle of the top navigation bar.​
- 2 users mentioned that they were afraid to click 'Done'.

>"'Done' button? I don't want to be done. Where is my ... my buttons changed down here [navigation bar on the bottom] I don't want the previous page, I don't want to be done. I would like to go home."  - Participant 9​
<br>

**5.** Typing is frustrating for AT users especially on smaller devices, however mobile devices offer easier ways to complete fields.
- 3 AT users attempted or used voice to text to fill out the form fields, 2 used predictive text from their device, and 1 used quick path swiping. ​
- 4/10 users expected their information to be prefilled.​
- Form fields/components users requested improvements on:​
- Number keyboards requested on fields (SSN, Postal Code, Phone).​
- Fields with dashes (SSN, Phone) need dashes pre-entered to make it easier to count numbers entered.​
- Review page needs entered data to be expanded upon entry to check for errors.​
- Read step number first before page header.​

>"If you're blind like me, the less you have to type, the better off I am. - I couldn't imagine having to type out paragraphs on this screen...with voiceover, it's really a touch, you gotta listen for a letter, do something with the letter, go to the next letter. It's a slow process, at least for me...I always fall back to my laptop. But I use my iPhone all the time for different things but I use dictate a lot. If that gets better that would be fine, it would be better talk than type and that would be easier for me."​ - Participant 6

<br>

**6.** Statuses are unclear both about the form and app form tabs 'active/complete'.​

- Statuses are unclear both about the form and app form tabs 'active/complete'.​
- Veterans interpret statuses as it relates to their user action not the VAs process.​
- Veterans occasionally checked both the active and complete tabs to identify their form.​
- Veterans desire more information about the status of the form, with notification in the app requested to alert them of changes. ​
- AT users sometimes tried to double click on the statement in support of a claim card to open the form, even after submission to review the form details they entered. 

>"Here's another grey area it says I have no complete forms, but I completed my form. I understand that it's in progress, the status of the form is in progress but its completed, I completed my form.  - I'm assuming that the complete and active aren't for me, they are for administration. If one of my forms had something it would be in here. Again, grey area, I don't like this. It should be in with the rest of my claims." - Participant 9
<br>
---

## **Additional Insights**
**1.** AT users often rely on support channels to navigate through VA systems . ​
They mentioned desiring help at the following points. 
- Locating the area of the app where they could submit a statement in support of a claim.​
- Ensuring they are completing the right form for their scenario (selecting the right option on screen ‘What would you like to do?’).​
- Returning to the app from a web view.​
- Assistance filling out the form.​
- Ensuring their form was properly received (expecting to receive an email confirmation). ​
- Getting more information about the status or progress of their form.

>"The home access, make that more accessible or an AI or chatbot like thing...sometimes you only need like a 'how do I do this." (p3)

<br>

**2.** Veterans expect to be sent messages or notifications about their form submission.​
- 3 participants went to the messaging area of the app to look for form submission confirmation.​
​
- 8 participants mentioned expecting to receive an email​
​
- 4 participants mentioned desiring notifications in the app

>"I would expect it to appear in something like my messages. It says there is a secure messaging on the app so that would be the logical place for them to notify me. You know, other apps… work that way, like my banking app. You know, they've got a little notification thing that says, hey, you have, you know, two more notifications. So you look there, and you go to your notifications." (p4)

<br> 

**3.** Mental models: Veterans know they need to complete a specific task such as ‘provide a statement in support of a new disability claim for themself’ but they may not see it as a form that the VA requires separately or understand which form they should use.​

- Veterans may confuse the process of submitting a statement in support of a claim with submitting a claim itself or submitting evidence or context about a claim.​
​
- Veterans rely on the app to direct them to the right activity needed vs. having to know where to go.
  
>"I feel confident now. Because I've searched everywhere else, and this seems to be the most logical place to do it the only thing that was confusing to me, I was looking for something that said 'initiate a new claim'." (p8)

<br>

### Recommendations

1. Address found accessibility issues to improve the app and the digital form.​
2. The MVP of forms in the app should focus on providing detailed status progression.​
3. Direct users to the 21-4138 form also under the context of claims, relate the action 'submit a statement' closer to the claim itself. ​
4. Clarify the options on the screen 'What would you like to do?’. ​
5. Limit or discourage use of webview from the app. ​
6. Update the text of the ‘Done’ button so users understand when to use it. ​
7. Consider only frequently utilized, short forms that require minimal typing from the user for the app with prefilled data where available. ​
8. Clarify statuses, providing additional explanation and showing progression. ​

### Recommendations based on additional findings 
1. Surface support hotlines throughout the process and ensure call center staff are equipped to assist Veterans who are navigating the app. In the future, consider in-app support options. ​
2. Send a notification to the user including the details displayed on the confirmation page.
3. Surface confirmation numbers, actions, and associated claim number related to their statement in the app after submission of a form.

## Product User and Business Outcomes

- **Desired User Outcome**
The overarching outcome of combining these native features into one app is that it will make it simpler and faster for users to interact with VA and complete day-to-day transactions.

  - This research supports our desired user outcome by bringing the digital forms experience into the app with the MVP being a commonly utilized form making it both simpler and faster to interact with the VA. 
 
- **Desired Business Outcome**
Empower business lines to provide targeted communication to Veterans. By building a mobile app, business units have the opportunity to close some of the existing communication gaps that exist at VA. For example, business units will be able to push notifications to users when pertinent information is available on either an individual or VA-wide level. This reduces the burden on Veterans themselves from having to navigate through VA to track down the status of their claims, or when their next healthcare appointment is.
  - This research supports our desired business outcome by providing users with supporting actions related to their claims together in the app and making available relevant information and updates about those actions.


## Key Performance Indicators

*Explain how findings will support KPI measurement.*  


- **Trust, satisfaction, and equity**

The findings in this research supports measurement of this KPI by...
  -  Measuring user satisfaction with the experience
  -  Measuring user confidence with this task
  -  Measuring desirability for this feature in the app 


## Next Steps

1. Share research findings with other impacted teams.
2. Refine Forms MVP in the app to surface status information about forms instead of launching the webview of the form.
3. Start build 


## Further research needed

In the future we recommend testing further with Android users.
