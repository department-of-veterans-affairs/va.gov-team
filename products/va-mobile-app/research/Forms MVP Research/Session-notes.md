Will compile all shared notes into one doc here after live sessions.

@jonathanpostMO notes—
 Forms UXR Session 081225 0700 PT 

- iOS / Internet Explorer (said this verbatim, maybe they weren’t sure about their actual default browser—could be it’s Safari?).
- Hesitated when asked about filling out forms on VA, wasn’t sure about time he had done this before. 
- Prototype isn’t correct, wasn’t built to spec (mismatch w/ Figma) 
    - We won’t know if the new navigation button we wanted to test is usable or desirable from this study.
- WebView date in form—Error state launches before user has attempted to fill in all fields, this is incorrect—shouldn’t lead to a fail state before we we’ve allowed users to try to succeed.
- Couldn’t find “Done” link to dismiss the WebView, needed prompting from moderator to continue. 
- Should we make confirmation numbers and status both available in the app? So users don’t have to go to WebView when troubleshooting or providing the number to someone else?
    - “It’s in the mail, going to a place”  =  Vet’s “In progress” mental model.
- Mimic’d “easy” question back to us as feedback, did we slip in a leading question in by accident?
