# Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is **Christine**. How are you doing today?

I have a colleague with us in this session who will be taking notes. 

There are a few of my teammates who would like to observe this session as well. **Would it be OK with you if I invited them to join us?**
- *(If participant seems hesitant or unsure or uncomfortable)* Just so you know, my teammates will be muted and off camera and you won't have to interact with them. You also have the option to keep the session just the two of us plus the notetaker (and the technical support person).
- *(If yes, let them in--3-4 MAX. If no, post to #feedback-backchannel "Sorry, the participant doesn't want any observers in this session.")*

- *(OBSERVERS JOIN w/cameras ON )* We have a few people from the team listening in today: there's [NAME] *(wave or say "hi")*, [NAME] *(wave or say "hi")*, etc. *(If I don't know the name of one of the observers, ask them to please turn on their camera and say their name aloud)*

Could the observers please turn their cameras off now to save bandwidth? 

Today we're going to talk about filling out forms from the VA mobile app. I'm going to ask you a few questions, and then I'll have you do some specific tasks using the VA Health & Benefits App, ending with a quick 10 question survey. As you go through these steps please speak aloud your thoughts and actions to help us understand more about your experience.

Before we start, I want to go over a few things:

- **This entire session may take 120 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
  
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. We're testing an app to learn how we can make it easier to use. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** Whether or not you choose to participate will not affect your benefits with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Just let me know.

- Finally, I would like to record my screen and audio to confirm that I‚Äôve captured your opinions accurately and sometimes share video clips with our colleagues at the VA to show user feedback. If we do this, we don‚Äôt link anything you choose to share in the session to any information that identifies you, and we remove your face and name from any videos that we share.
**Knowing this, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**
  - *(If yes:)* Once I start recording, I am going to confirm once more that you are ok with me recording this session.

‚û°Ô∏è Select **Record**, then **Record to the cloud**.

*(If participant asks you to NOT record)* Are you comfortable if I save the transcript of the session? *(If not, take good notes!)*

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: 
  - **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?** Yes / No
 
  - **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners as long as we remove any information that can be used to identify you?** Yes / No

*Moderator: In the bottom toolbar of the Zoom window, click the arrow next to **SHOW CAPTIONS** > **View Full Transcript** > Save (NEED TO DO THIS TO GET TRANSCRIPT)*

*After checking that transcription is working, close the Transcript panel by clicking **Close Full Transcript** in the Show Captions menu.*


## Troubleshooting
- [Avoid **AI Companion**, which is a new option next to ‚ÄúShare‚Äù in the Zoom buttons]

- [If see **unpredictable jumping around** behavior and participant is using a browser other than Chrome, ask them to switch to Chrome (this helped with VoiceOver on an iPhone using Safari)]

- [If having **difficulty moving windows around** or opening the prototype, you could request control of the participant‚Äôs screen and mouse in Zoom: `<Name>‚Äôs screen tab > Request remote control`. Then you can move/resize browser (but not zoom windows/buttons) and type into browser bar. The participant may need to minimize the zoom video view, and drag the zoom buttons to the bottom of the screen so out of the way.]

# Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Let‚Äôs start with a few questions... 

1. I understand you are a Veteran. Is that right? 
    - Thanks for confirming that.

> Yes

<br>

2. What kind of device are you using today? *(Tablet / Smartphone)*
    - *(If not the expected device, ask to rejoin that way)*

> Smartphone

<br>

3. What operating system is on your device? *(iOS / Android / _______)*

> Android

<br>

4. What is the default web browser set up on your device? *(Chrome / Firefox / Edge / Safari / _______)*

> Chrome

<br>

5. Have you ever filled out a VA form online before? 

> Yes

<br>
   - If so, can you tell me about your most recent experience? How did it go?

> It went good, either one of our forms or the form the doctor made. VA has so many different form numbers, I don‚Äôt even remember which one it is. But it was fairly easy to do.

<br>
  
6. Do you have the VA Health and Benefits mobile app downloaded on your device?

> Yes

<br>
If so, can you tell me what you use the mobile app primarily for? 

> I use it primarily for secure messages, to order my prescriptions, I think that‚Äôs all I can do is the secure messaging and to prescriptions. I could do at one point, VA letters and stuff if I need to. I never have used that yet.
   
How has your experience been so far?

> So far so good, I haven‚Äôt had any issues with it.

<br>

# User Tasks

## Task 0: Share screen

If Y, why?

> No

<br>

Did you find any labels particularly confusing on the form?

<br>

- What does this status mean to you? 

> They haven‚Äôt received it, it‚Äôs still in progress

<br>

- What would you expect to see if you needed to check on your submission later?

> Just to log in and see it. Once it disappears it would probably go to the completed tab.‚Äù 24:03 ‚Äú Another thing you could do for some people, I know who are OCD, you could color code them like yellow could be where its in that holding stage or submitted stage. Green is where its completed and red where its not done. Just have three colors. I have some veterans that file their systems that way.

<br>

### Watch for:

[Moderator copy/paste link to Qualitrix SuS into the chat] (SuS Link)(https://dj540s05.optimalworkshop.com/questions/vhbappformsmvp)

Please select the link and take the survey.

Took the Sus survey, did experience delays due to service for loading/selection.



### Deleting the testing app:
Now that we have completed the study today I'm going to prompt you to delete the VA testing app from your device. 

User had difficulty finding the testing apps in the Play Store to uninstall at first, had to filter to search.

User did not have or need App Tester

User did not have to set up Developer options on his phone settings either. User could not find systems under settings on his phone, checked in ‚ÄòAbout‚Äô, he was good and did not need to change the developer options.



**iOS users:** 
If you navigate to your device home screen, and engage the menu screen of the VA testing app we used today select 'Delete app'. Remove from device.

**Android users:***

1. We now need to ensure you turn off the developer options we turned on for the test from the "Google Play Store".
2. Navigate back to ‚ÄúGoogle Play Store‚Äù
3. Select ‚Äúuninstall‚Äù
4. Go back to the main phone home screen, lower menu bar select square in the middle.
5. Swipe up to remove Google Play Store window
6. Now go back to the main screen, open the ‚ÄúGoogle Play Store‚Äù
7. Click on your name in the top right 
8. Settings > General > Click on the ‚ÄúDeveloper options‚Äù > Toggle off ‚ÄúInternal app sharing‚Äù
9. Go to settings on phone > scroll to bottom > click on developer options > Toggle on top for on/off > Toggle off (it will obscure the screen because of screen share)
10. Go back one, there should be no developer mode.
11. Reinstall the VA app

(hint: to switch browser windows the user can select the three lines III in the bottom left corner of their lower nav. menu)

## Thank You and Closing - 3 minutes

**How did you find this process overall?**

Fairly easy, I like how they are starting to update the app more and make a lot of needed changes. Make it more simple for a lot of Veterans, especially the older Veterans.

**Was there any part that felt especially frustrating or mentally tiring?**

> No

<br>

**Are you still okay if we use any video or audio clips from this session?** 

> Yes

<br>

- *(yes / no)*
- *(If participant says yes)* Is there any part of our discussion that you would NOT want shared in a video clip?

**We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today**. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to learn about Veterans so we can improve the online tools that we provide. 

If you know any other Veterans or family members who might be willing to participate in a future research session like this one, you can pass along the web link that you'll receive in your email from our team. 

Thank you so much again, and I hope that you enjoy the rest of your day!
