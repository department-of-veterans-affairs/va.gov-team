# Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is **Christine**. How are you doing today?

I have a colleague with us in this session who will be taking notes **Notetaker First Name** and our accessibility specialist **AT Specialist First Name** will be on the call available to provide support with any technical issues that may arise with your use of assistive technology should you need it.

There are a few of my teammates who would like to observe this session as well. **Would it be OK with you if I invited them to join us?**
- *(If participant seems hesitant or unsure or uncomfortable)* Just so you know, my teammates will be muted and off camera and you won't have to interact with them. You also have the option to keep the session just the two of us plus the notetaker (and the technical support person).
- *(If yes, let them in--3-4 MAX. If no, post to #feedback-backchannel "Sorry, the participant doesn't want any observers in this session.")*

- *(OBSERVERS JOIN w/cameras ON )* We have a few people from the team listening in today: there's [NAME] *(wave or say "hi")*, [NAME] *(wave or say "hi")*, etc. *(If I don't know the name of one of the observers, ask them to please turn on their camera and say their name aloud)*

Could the observers please turn their cameras off now to save bandwidth? 

Today we're going to talk about filling out forms from the VA mobile app. I'm going to ask you a few questions, and then I'll have you do some specific tasks using the VA Health & Benefits App. As you go through these steps please speak aloud your thoughts and actions to help us understand more about your experience.

Before we start, I want to go over a few things:

- **This entire session may take 90 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
  
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. We're testing an app to learn how we can make it easier to use. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** Whether or not you choose to participate will not affect your benefits with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Just let me know.

- Finally, I would like to record my screen and audio to confirm that I‚Äôve captured your opinions accurately and sometimes share video clips with our colleagues at the VA to show user feedback. If we do this, we don‚Äôt link anything you choose to share in the session to any information that identifies you, and we remove your face and name from any videos that we share.
**Knowing this, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**
  - *(If yes:)* Once I start recording, I am going to confirm once more that you are ok with me recording this session.

**yes**

‚û°Ô∏è Select **Record**, then **Record to the cloud**.

*(If participant asks you to NOT record)* Are you comfortable if I save the transcript of the session? *(If not, take good notes!)*

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: 
  - **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?** Yes / No
 
  - **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners as long as we remove any information that can be used to identify you?** Yes / No

**yes**

**yes**

*Moderator: In the bottom toolbar of the Zoom window, click the arrow next to **SHOW CAPTIONS** > **View Full Transcript** > Save (NEED TO DO THIS TO GET TRANSCRIPT)*

*After checking that transcription is working, close the Transcript panel by clicking **Close Full Transcript** in the Show Captions menu.*


## Troubleshooting
- [Avoid **AI Companion**, which is a new option next to ‚ÄúShare‚Äù in the Zoom buttons]

- [If see **unpredictable jumping around** behavior and participant is using a browser other than Chrome, ask them to switch to Chrome (this helped with VoiceOver on an iPhone using Safari)]

- [If having **difficulty moving windows around** or opening the prototype, you could request control of the participant‚Äôs screen and mouse in Zoom: `<Name>‚Äôs screen tab > Request remote control`. Then you can move/resize browser (but not zoom windows/buttons) and type into browser bar. The participant may need to minimize the zoom video view, and drag the zoom buttons to the bottom of the screen so out of the way.]

# User Tasks

## Task 0: Share screen

I would like you to share your screen with me so that I can see what you do during this session. Before we start, I want to make sure you know that screen share will show me your whole screen, so if you'd like to close any apps or turn off notifications that you don't want me to see, you could do that now.
- *(refer to Screen sharing instructions above, if needed)*
- *STOP TECH TROUBLESHOOTING **< 15 min into session** if want a replacement participant from Perigean b/c not likely to be successful*

We can help guide you through sharing your screen when you're ready if you'd like assistance. Please say what you're doing out loud so that if there are any issues, we'll know what they are.
1. Make sure that the Zoom application has focus
2. Navigate to the screen share button (may need to tap on mobile device to display the menu at the bottom, may have to scroll over to see menu options).
3. Check the "share sound" checkbox (so we can hear their screen reader speaking)--may have to tab a LOT to get to this in the right pane
4. Activate the screen share

**(If video window is covering up phone screen)** It looks like my zoom video is covering up a lot of your screen. Could you please swipe it off? (Screen reader: swipe right until the video window has focus, and then double tap when you hear "Stash preview".)

**Note for all users: You'll be interacting with a demo prototype today.** Since it's a demo, note that none of your actions will affect your own VA information or benefits.


## Task 1: Login to the VA Health and Benefits mobile app
[start on the VA Health and Benefits mobile app version: 2.59.1 (3031) for iOS]

I'd like you to take a look at this screen, and sign in.

[When they get to the homepage:] Any data used throughout this test is not your real data or connected to your VA account in any way. This is a test environment with artifical testing data displayed only. 

**For screen magnifier participants.**
[Confirm you're seeing what they are seeing by asking them] "What is on your screen now?

**I'm seeing [same as what we're seeing]**

**It's all in my view [no scrolling]**

Are you seeing the participants screen magnified at all? 

If not, ask the participant to check their settings on their device by navigating to...

1. Settings
2. Accessibility
3. Zoom
4. Show while mirroring toggle on



## Task 2: Start a statement
As we go through the steps in this study, please talk aloud about what you're thinking BEFORE clicking on anything.

Today I'd like you to pretend that you need to submit a statement in support of a new disability claim for yourself using the VA Health & Benefits Mobile App. 

### Question for testing participant:

- Before we start, what do you expect this process to be like?

**I expect it to give me step by step isntructions on how to complete this form. and to do it online without having to mail it in**  

Thank you for sharing that, You may begin the task to submit a statement in support of a new disability claim for yourself.

*Allow the user to navigate to and through the form on their own without guiding them through the happy path. 

### If the user gets lost...

On a path that isn't fully built out and is stuck, you can offer the 'Apple' button at the top to jump them to the forms section of the app.


### Watch for:
- How the user gets to forms. Do they click anything other than "Go to Forms"? Y/N

**So I just click on claims?**

**(Claims - to initiate a new claim)**

**(Claims History) I really don't see where I need to go. All I'm seeing is old claims. I don't see where I need to go to actually initiate a new claim**

**(what next?) I would go back home and see what else I could try**

**(back to home screen) The only thing I see that might help me is Forms. I'll try that one. It says it doesn't have any active forms so I guess that's not where I need to go either**

**(found instructions for Submit a statement...) Okay, this is where I need to be**

**(support of a claim) I don't think this is where I need to be**

**(what next?) back to the home I guess. (goes back to Forms) I'm going to go back to Home and see what I can try**

**(Claims - scrolls down - closed claims - back - Letters - Review Letters - Health tab) I'm not seeing anything that can help me initiate a claim here**

**(what next if on her own?) I would call somebody that would be able to assist me. Like another veteran who has done this before. Most people I know do it by paper. I've never actually talked to anybody who has done this online**

**(on Forms - not clear if statement is new or previous claim) So from this screen I would click on Continue form?**

**(goes to Statement page) So from here I click Start a Statement, and fill out my information here?**

**so on this screen, what I want to do isn't listed here.**

 - If Y, where do they go instead?

- Does the user mentions any confusion on where to go to start a new statement. Y/N

 - If Y, what do they find confusing?

- In this step, what did the participant expect to happen?

 - Did they mention any previous experience or confusion?

- Did the user understand the 'Submit a statement in support of a claim' introductory screen? Y/N

 - Did the user comment on this screen?

- What option did the user select on the 'What would you like to do here?' screen?

  - Did the user share any confusion about the options provided?


### Questions for testing participant: 

- How was your experience navigating to the form from your [assistive tech/device]? 

** The magnifier was helpful. The only problem was finding what I needed**
  
- How confident do you feel that you're in the right place to submit your statement?

**I feel confident now. Because I've searched everywhere else, and this seems to be the most logical place to do it**
**the only thing that was confusing to me, I was looking for something that said 'initiate a new claim'.**
  
- Before you start the form itself, what do you expect this form completion process to be like?

**You mean actually typing it in here and getting it done? It's going to be very slow for me because I don't type well and don't see well. It's going to be time consuming**

## Task 3: Fill out the form [never back out or reload the page]
As you go through this form I'll ask that you please fill it out using fake details so you don't share your personal information with me. 

**For screen magnifier participants:**
[Confirm you're seeing what they are seeing by asking them] First, I'd like to confirm "What is on your screen now? 

**(seems to see what we're seeing on screen)**

Thank you.

You may continue on with the form.

**(slowly types letters)**

**okay i did that part, now I'm on part 2**

**(error with SSN - didn't add dashes at first. Adding too many digits but not realizing it. repeated a new number many times, but always with 10 digits. Next added = instead of -)**

### Watch for:
- Does the user encounter any errors when entering the data into the form fields? Y/N

 - If Y, what field do they encounter errors on?

 - What triggered the error specifically?

 - Does the user understand how to correct the error? 

- Does the user experience any difficulty completing the fields from their mobile device Y/N

 - If Y, what specific challenges did they experience?

 - How did the user troubleshoot these challenges?

- Does the user express thoughts of frustration while completing the form? Y/N

 - If Y, what did they experience when expressing the frustration?


## Task 4: (After SSN before 'Continue') take a break in filling out the form
At this point, I'm going to have you pretend that you need to step away from the form for an extended period of time, you can leave the form now and go back to the homepage of the mobile app. 

**So i would finish this application later, and go back to the home screen?**

**I don't see an easy way of getting back to the home screen. I don't want to press done.**

**(using back button)**

**I'm back at Home.**

### Watch for:
- In this step, what did the participant expect to happen?

 - Did they mention any previous experience or confusion?

- What does the user do to leave the form?

- Does the user express doubt that their work will be saved? Y/N


### Questions for testing participant: 

- How was your experience navigating to the homepage of the app from the partially completed form [screen reader/assistive tech/device]? 

**It was okay. Once I knew where I needed to go**

- How confident do you feel that your work will be saved?

**I feel confident that it will be saved**


## Task 5: Continue completing the started form and submit
Now, pretend you are ready to come back to your previous form. 

Please locate your previous form and continue on.

**(Forms - Continue Form - Start your statement)**

**I'm sure this is not it.**

**(Goes back to Continue Form - scrolls up and down this page)**

**(tech issue - form did not save, but she was doing things right)**

**I clicked Save and Continue Later. Maybe it didn't recoginze that I did it? I really can't find it.**

**(if didn't save) I would have to just start over**

**(asking if she's willing to start again) Yes**

**(fills out new form)**

### Watch for:

- In this step, what did the participant expect to happen?

 - Did they mention any previous experience or confusion?

- Does the user understand that they are continuing with the same form they started at the beginning of the session? Y/N

 - If no, what do they mention that is confusing?

- Is the user able to complete the started form? Y/N

 - If no, what prohibited them from submitting the initial form?


### Observation points for screen reader users:

- Does the participant navigate linearly or jump between sections?
  
- How do they orient themselves when they lose focus?
  
- Do they use heading navigation, landmarks, or other AT-specific features?
  

### Questions for screen magnifier users:

- Are you able to percieve the full form field labels and any error messages?

**yes**
  
- Do you need to scroll horizontally to see all content?

**yes**

### Questions for testing participant: 

**(slowly types each item)**

**(Provide your statement) So I just type my statement now?**

**(slowly types, uses Delete key often for typos)**

- How was your experience filling out the form from the mobile app using your [assistive tech/device]? 

**(see without scrolling?) I think I can see everything without having to scroll.**

**(error in name - added period after middle initial)**

- Were there any fields where your assistive technology didn't work as expected?

**no, just with my typing. It was my fault.**
  
- What worked well for you?

**I was able to see the questions that they were asking and could type them in easier. So it was pretty much simple to do the typing**
  
- What was unclear for you?

**everything was clear, as far as reading the question and answering the questions.**
  
- How does this compare to filling out forms on VA.gov or other websites?

**It's pretty much the same for me.**
  
- What would make this process feel familiar to you?

**Maybe if I had used it more and become more familiar with the site and know exactly where I need to go. That's going to come with experience and practice. Lots of trial and errors on my part**
  
- If you had to take breaks, where would there be natural stopping points?

**I would probaly just go until submit.**


## Task 6: View submitted form
Now that you have completed the form, please go back to the app.



### Questions for testing participant: 
- Based on what you see now, how do you know the form was submitted? 

**It says Submitted on [date] in Progress. So that leads me to believe that it's submitted and it's active. I assume from all of this that it's in there**

- What does this status mean to you? 

**Active - it means they got it, I'm pretty sure they're not working on it now.**

**(In progress) to me it means that it's there. And it's not complete, so that means somebody is working on it. that's what in progress means to me.**

- If you needed to reference this form submission in a phone call with VA, what information would you look for?

**the form number. I would tell them that I filed a claim, this is the form number, give them the date I filed it, hopefully they can give me a status for what's going on with it**

- What would you expect to see if you needed to check on your submission later?

**I would expect to see if it's complete, if I click on this I want to see if it's complete. If it's active or complete**

- How would you expect to be notified of updates to this form?

**Through my email. Hopefully they would email me if they needed more information. At least by mail. They have my address as well. They have two ways. I would expect to hear from them online, through an email**

### Watch for:
- In this step, what did the participant expect to happen?

 - Did they mention any previous experience or confusion?

- Does the user express confidence that they have completed and submitted their form?

 - If no, what is confusing to them and why?

- Does the user understand the status of the form?

 - If not, what do confusion do they express when interpretting the form status?


### Deleting the testing app:
Now that we have completed the study today I'm going to assist you with deleting the VA testing app from your device. 

**iOS users:** 
If you navigate to your device home screen, and engage the menu screen of the VA testing app we used today select 'Delete app'. Remove from device.

**(went to home screen of app first)**

**Android users:***

1. We now need to ensure you turn off the developer options we turned on for the test from the "Google Play Store".
2. Navigate back to ‚ÄúGoogle Play Store‚Äù
3. Select ‚Äúuninstall‚Äù
4. Go back to the main phone home screen, lower menu bar select square in the middle.
5. Swipe up to remove Google Play Store window

7. Click on your name in the top right 
8. Settings > General > Click on the ‚ÄúDeveloper options‚Äù > Toggle off ‚ÄúInternal app sharing‚Äù
9. Go to settings on phone > scroll to bottom > click on developer options > Toggle on top for on/off > Toggle off (it will obscure the screen because of screen share)
10. Go back one, there should be no developer mode.
11. Reinstall the VA app

(hint: to switch browser windows the user can select the three lines III in the bottom left corner of their lower nav. menu)

## Thank You and Closing - 3 minutes

- How was this process overall for you?

**Well, it was intresting. It wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. When it comes to computers, I'm the worst person in the world to know anything about them. I'm claiming that I did well to myself. I don't know how you thought I did, but I'm claiming that I did well with my knowledge and experience. I'm happy with my progress.**

- Was there anything you would change about this process?

**no, it was fine. It was painless. I was kind of dreading it. Because I didn't know really what to expect. But it was, was easy enough. I feel good about the experience and about myself**

- What parts required the most concentration?

**the hardest thing was finding that form that you told me to search for. After that, everything else fell into place**

- Do you feel you would like to complete forms using the mobile app in the future? Why or why not?

**I would. I probably would try it this week. I have a claim or two that I've been putting off doing all the paperwork. But if I can sit here and do it... I'm more motivated now**

**(not yet available on the app - can do it on VA.gov)**

**Are you still okay if we use any video or audio clips from this session?** 
- *(yes / no)*

**I'm still okay, yes**

- *(If participant says yes)* Is there any part of our discussion that you would NOT want shared in a video clip?

**no, all is fine**

**(magifying setting)I have it at 75%**

**We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today**. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to learn about Veterans so we can improve the online tools that we provide. 

If you know any other Veterans or family members who might be willing to participate in a future research session like this one, you can pass along the web link that you'll receive in your email from our team. 

Thank you so much again, and I hope that you enjoy the rest of your day!
