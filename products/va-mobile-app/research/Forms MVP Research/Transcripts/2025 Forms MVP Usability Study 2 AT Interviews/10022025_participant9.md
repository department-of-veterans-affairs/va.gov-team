# Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is **Christine**. How are you doing today?

I have a colleague with us in this session who will be taking notes **Notetaker First Name** and our accessibility specialist **AT Specialist First Name** will be on the call available to provide support with any technical issues that may arise with your use of assistive technology should you need it.

There are a few of my teammates who would like to observe this session as well. **Would it be OK with you if I invited them to join us?**
- *(If participant seems hesitant or unsure or uncomfortable)* Just so you know, my teammates will be muted and off camera and you won't have to interact with them. You also have the option to keep the session just the two of us plus the notetaker (and the technical support person).
- *(If yes, let them in--3-4 MAX. If no, post to #feedback-backchannel "Sorry, the participant doesn't want any observers in this session.")*

- *(OBSERVERS JOIN w/cameras ON )* We have a few people from the team listening in today: there's [NAME] *(wave or say "hi")*, [NAME] *(wave or say "hi")*, etc. *(If I don't know the name of one of the observers, ask them to please turn on their camera and say their name aloud)*

Could the observers please turn their cameras off now to save bandwidth? 

Today we're going to talk about filling out forms from the VA mobile app. I'm going to ask you a few questions, and then I'll have you do some specific tasks using the VA Health & Benefits App. As you go through these steps please speak aloud your thoughts and actions to help us understand more about your experience.

Before we start, I want to go over a few things:

- **This entire session may take 90 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
  
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. We're testing an app to learn how we can make it easier to use. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** Whether or not you choose to participate will not affect your benefits with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Just let me know.

- Finally, I would like to record my screen and audio to confirm that I‚Äôve captured your opinions accurately and sometimes share video clips with our colleagues at the VA to show user feedback. If we do this, we don‚Äôt link anything you choose to share in the session to any information that identifies you, and we remove your face and name from any videos that we share.
**Knowing this, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**
  - *(If yes:)* Once I start recording, I am going to confirm once more that you are ok with me recording this session.

‚û°Ô∏è Select **Record**, then **Record to the cloud**.

*(If participant asks you to NOT record)* Are you comfortable if I save the transcript of the session? *(If not, take good notes!)*

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: 
  - **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?** Yes / No
  - **I am**
 
  - **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners as long as we remove any information that can be used to identify you?** Yes / No
  - **I am**

*Moderator: In the bottom toolbar of the Zoom window, click the arrow next to **SHOW CAPTIONS** > **View Full Transcript** > Save (NEED TO DO THIS TO GET TRANSCRIPT)*

*After checking that transcription is working, close the Transcript panel by clicking **Close Full Transcript** in the Show Captions menu.*


## Troubleshooting
- [Avoid **AI Companion**, which is a new option next to ‚ÄúShare‚Äù in the Zoom buttons]

- [If see **unpredictable jumping around** behavior and participant is using a browser other than Chrome, ask them to switch to Chrome (this helped with VoiceOver on an iPhone using Safari)]

- [If having **difficulty moving windows around** or opening the prototype, you could request control of the participant‚Äôs screen and mouse in Zoom: `<Name>‚Äôs screen tab > Request remote control`. Then you can move/resize browser (but not zoom windows/buttons) and type into browser bar. The participant may need to minimize the zoom video view, and drag the zoom buttons to the bottom of the screen so out of the way.]

# Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

5. What type of assistive technology are you using right now?
   - None on iphone
   - Use it to zoom in, some apps don't natively do that, like Gmail for example
   - Mentions using Native talkback
    

6. How many years have you been using [assistive technology]?
   - 7-8 years

7. When or how often do you use it?
    - Always trying to zoom in 

8. How would you rate your level of experience with using a screen reader/magnifier--beginner, intermediate, advanced, or expert?
    - I try not to use expert, so I would say advanced

9. Have you ever shared your screen in Zoom while using a screen reader/magnifier?
    - From my iphone no, from my android yes, laptop yes
    - Shares his phone screen from another camera

10. Have you ever filled out a VA form online before?
    - I have
   - If so, can you tell me about your most recent experience? How did it go?
   - Travel reimbursement, a yelp review of a 4 or a 7 out of 10
   - How would my mom handle this? There's a lot on the form that's noise and not straightforward. Open a claim, Alright, here it all is. Do you want to hit next or submit? But then up above, right, where my mom doesn't read. It's, hey, you need to add‚Ä¶ what do you‚Ä¶ what are you‚Ä¶ line items are you trying to add? You have to drop down from a list, and you have to add, well, I want to do mileage reimbursement. So you choose that, you go through all the options of. This is your starting point, this is the end point, and if the starting point, or if the end point doesn't actually exist within the VA. That's‚Ä¶ that was‚Ä¶ that's why I would just say it's a 7 because I needed this LE‚Ä¶ uh, mental therapist location, and it only had these 3. So I had to‚Ä¶ I chose one of the other ones, I tried to change the address, and it let me change the address. Did all that type of stuff, but it wasn't really‚Ä¶ like, my mom wouldn't have been able to do it.
She would have gotten confused, and I would get to call it‚Ä¶ whatever time, hey.
Here's this thing. Well, what did it say, Mom? I don't know, I just hit the buttons. Well‚Ä¶ Can you not do that, right? So, okay.
So I added the address, all that type of stuff, got through that, hit OK.
And then it brought me back to that first‚Ä¶ page, so are you good with this? But it didn't actually give me‚Ä¶ an explanation of what I'm good with. It didn't‚Ä¶ it didn't‚Ä¶ Say, hey, let's review your page. It just said, okay, you got all this. Are you good with it? Um, yes? So, you hit re‚Ä¶ or you hit accept.
And then, after all of that, it says, okay, here you go, claim submitted, type of thing, but then‚Ä¶ what you need to go back to is‚Ä¶ or then it asks you if you want to add any‚Ä¶ any other things, but it didn't act‚Ä¶ oh, sorry.
Sorry. Revert‚Ä¶ rewind a little bit. It says, are you okay with this?
To that first screen, I'm sorry, I'm going off of memory.
It asks you if you're good with it, and then, uh, but it doesn't actually add the line item of mileage.
You have to say yes, then it takes you to the next page, and it has the mileage, but it doesn't actually give you the details.
And it says, are you good with this? Then you hit submit, and then it moves forward with it. So there's no real‚Ä¶ Um, what am I actually filling out? Where am I doing it at? What is the information? And‚Ä¶
You keep asking me if‚Ä¶ not you‚Ä¶ the forum keep asking me if‚Ä¶ if I'm good with it, but there's no actual.
Displaying of information. So. Um, so that's a lot of detail, a lot of time, right, in this, but that example applies to a lot of the different‚Ä¶ forms that I'm filling out. There's no, um‚Ä¶ when it takes me to a new page, it actually takes me to a new page, it doesn't do a dialogue window, it doesn't do an expand.
It takes me to a new page, and then it actually never really brings me back to where I started from. And so, I could see how people could get lost in that process flow. It seems like it jumps all over the place, and it's not really straightforward, it's not gonna do‚Ä¶ the user experience isn't really there. The information‚Ä¶ Awesome. How it links in all of the different forms.
That's‚Ä¶ that's‚Ä¶ that's amazing. What it‚Ä¶ from a user experience, there's a lot of gaps and pitfalls. I would say not even gaps, there's a lot‚Ä¶ lots of holes. That people could fall into and just get lost and go, okay, I‚Ä¶ I give up.

Form could be more intuitive and there's an efficiency that seems to be lost
  
11. Do you have the VA Health and Benefits mobile app downloaded on your device?
 - Yes on android
   - If so, can you tell me what you use the mobile app primarily for? How has your experience been so far?
   - All of it, messaging, appointment location, prescriptions, claim status, I think that's about it - Use as an assistant
   - 7 - Logging in from phone, MFA is texting - if device is stolen what's the point of MFA right? I have questions about that perspective
   - Seems antiquated, mentions AI assistants in bank apps - like a chatbot: it would give my mom somebody else to bug/walk her through
   - AI could help provide a filter instead of seeing all of the noise


# User Tasks

## Task 0: Share screen

I would like you to share your screen with me so that I can see what you do during this session. Before we start, I want to make sure you know that screen share will show me your whole screen, so if you'd like to close any apps or turn off notifications that you don't want me to see, you could do that now.
- *(refer to Screen sharing instructions above, if needed)*
- *STOP TECH TROUBLESHOOTING **< 15 min into session** if want a replacement participant from Perigean b/c not likely to be successful*

We can help guide you through sharing your screen when you're ready if you'd like assistance. Please say what you're doing out loud so that if there are any issues, we'll know what they are.
1. Make sure that the Zoom application has focus
2. Navigate to the screen share button (may need to tap on mobile device to display the menu at the bottom, may have to scroll over to see menu options).
3. Check the "share sound" checkbox (so we can hear their screen reader speaking)--may have to tab a LOT to get to this in the right pane
4. Activate the screen share

**(If video window is covering up phone screen)** It looks like my zoom video is covering up a lot of your screen. Could you please swipe it off? (Screen reader: swipe right until the video window has focus, and then double tap when you hear "Stash preview".)

## Task 00: Open prototype
**for iOS users:** 
Did you previously receive the link and instructions to download the testing version of the mobile app today?

Y - Were you able to download the app via those instructions? Y - skip down to note for all users

N - I can now share the URL: that takes you to download the testing app, How would you prefer to receive the URL? I could dictate it to you, put it in the Zoom chat, email it to you, or (for smartphone only) text it to you.

**[Android link](https://appdistribution.firebase.dev/i/6bea6c3fabc1a872)** Build #2850 build version 2.59.0
- *(If asked, reassure that this is a legitimate link to what I want you to test)*

Did you get the link? 

- *If ‚Äúunsupported browser‚Äù error, ask to try a different browser or device, or share my screen (works for anyone) and mouse control (doesn't work w/iPhones)*
- *If prototype doesn't open, copy the URL and open in a new incognito window (Chrome), private window (Firefox, Safari) or InPrivate (Edge)*

Please click the (green) "Continue" button.

Instructions to access prototype for **iOS users**(must access from your mobile device):
1. Use the link provided to install test flight on your mobile device. - **seeing cannot connect to app store, the device may be too old, will try Android and use his computer for magnification**

11. And then go ahead and "Install"
12. Pause before signing in

**Note for all users: You'll be interacting with a demo prototype today.** Since it's a demo, note that none of your actions will affect your own VA information or benefits.


## Task 1: Login to the VA Health and Benefits mobile app
[start on the VA Health and Benefits mobile app version: 2.59.1 (3031) for iOS]

I'd like you to take a look at this screen, and sign in.

[When they get to the homepage:] Any data used throughout this test is not your real data or connected to your VA account in any way. This is a test environment with artifical testing data displayed only. 

**For screen magnifier participants.**
[Confirm you're seeing what they are seeing by asking them] "What is on your screen now?

Are you seeing the participants screen magnified at all? 
No - using computer for that

If not, ask the participant to check their settings on their device by navigating to...

1. Settings
2. Accessibility
3. Zoom
4. Show while mirroring toggle on



## Task 2: Start a statement
As we go through the steps in this study, please talk aloud about what you're thinking BEFORE clicking on anything.

Today I'd like you to pretend that you need to submit a statement in support of a new disability claim for yourself using the VA Health & Benefits Mobile App. 

### Question for testing participant:

- Before we start, what do you expect this process to be like?
  I would expect to see my existing claim, I would expect to see a status of where I was at, um, all my different claims. And, um, let's see, what else would she do? She would, um‚Ä¶ be able to edit‚Ä¶ and add, uh, additional information, supportive information. Like, uh, a statement to any particular claim that she would see.

Thank you for sharing that, You may begin the task to submit a statement in support of a new disability claim for yourself.

*Allow the user to navigate to and through the form on their own without guiding them through the happy path. 

### If the user gets lost...

On a path that isn't fully built out and is stuck, you can offer the 'Apple' button at the top to jump them to the forms section of the app.


### Watch for:
- How the user gets to forms. Do they click anything other than "Go to Forms"? Y/N
  **Yes**

 - If Y, where do they go instead?
  ** Benefits - Claim letters
   Had to be directed to tap Apple**

- Does the user mentions any confusion on where to go to start a new statement. Y/N
  **Yes**

 - If Y, what do they find confusing?
   **Lost but is excited by the ability to pinch and zoom in web view
   Respondent time 15 minutes could be worded better**

- In this step, what did the participant expect to happen?

 - Did they mention any previous experience or confusion?

- Did the user understand the 'Submit a statement in support of a claim' introductory screen? Y/N

 - Did the user comment on this screen?

- What option did the user select on the 'What would you like to do here?' screen?

  - Did the user share any confusion about the options provided?


### Questions for testing participant: 

- How was your experience navigating to the form from your [assistive tech/device]?
  **Seems self explanatory after low hanging fruit**

- How confident do you feel that you're in the right place to submit your statement?
  **Was confident until you asked me that question
  Why would I have that banner there? "Submit a statement to support a claim" now I'm questioning my life choices**

- Before you start the form itself, what do you expect this form completion process to be like?
**  Real quick, am I in the right form? (He is) That is very confusing
  If there needs to be two timelines, prefers having it noted on the steps like (2 minutes, 5 minutes) to add up to the 15 minute expected burden**


## Task 3: Fill out the form [never back out or reload the page]
As you go through this form I'll ask that you please fill it out using fake details so you don't share your personal information with me. 


**For screen magnifier participants:**
[Confirm you're seeing what they are seeing by asking them] First, I'd like to confirm "What is on your screen now? 

Thank you.

You may continue on with the form.

### Watch for:
- Does the user encounter any errors when entering the data into the form fields? Y/N
  **Yes**

 - If Y, what field do they encounter errors on?
   **Yes on SSN because of consecutive numbers**

 - What triggered the error specifically?

 - Does the user understand how to correct the error? 
   **Moderator explained**
   
- Does the user experience any difficulty completing the fields from their mobile device Y/N

 - If Y, what specific challenges did they experience?

 - How did the user troubleshoot these challenges?

- Does the user express thoughts of frustration while completing the form? Y/N
  **Yes**

 - If Y, what did they experience when expressing the frustration?


## Task 4: (After SSN before 'Continue') take a break in filling out the form
At this point, I'm going to have you pretend that you need to step away from the form for an extended period of time, you can leave the form now and go back to the homepage of the mobile app. 


### Watch for:
- In this step, what did the participant expect to happen?

 - Did they mention any previous experience or confusion?

- What does the user do to leave the form?

- Does the user express doubt that their work will be saved? Y/N


### Questions for testing participant: 

- How was your experience navigating to the homepage of the app from the partially completed form [screen reader/assistive tech/device]?
  **I don't want to be done. Presented? Nope, I don't want to do that one. I don't see a home button. I would like to go home. Do I not get to go home? I'm orphaned. Um‚Ä¶ Uh, let's hit 3‚Ä¶ fresh. That just refreshes the page, right? What happens if I hit done? Oh. Okay, that was not as self-explanatory whatsoever. I would‚Ä¶ nope. Nope.**
  
- How confident do you feel that your work will be saved?
  **11/10**


## Task 5: Continue completing the started form and submit
Now, pretend you are ready to come back to your previous form. 

Please locate your previous form and continue on.
**Didn't see "Go to my forms" at first; requesting a new form, or submitting a new form isn't really my form, it's a new form.**

### Watch for:

- In this step, what did the participant expect to happen?

 - Did they mention any previous experience or confusion?

- Does the user understand that they are continuing with the same form they started at the beginning of the session? Y/N
**  Yes
  Expects mailing address to be autofilled if it's already stored in the app
  Encounted an error entering name (left out middle initial)
  Not sure how to print on phone. It should automatically send an email and allow you to print 
  **
  
 - If no, what do they mention that is confusing?
 - Done vs go back to va.gov is confusing - go back to the page

- Is the user able to complete the started form? Y/N

 - If no, what prohibited them from submitting the initial form?


### Observation points for screen reader users:

- Does the participant navigate linearly or jump between sections?
  
- How do they orient themselves when they lose focus?
  
- Do they use heading navigation, landmarks, or other AT-specific features?
  

### Questions for screen magnifier users:

- Are you able to percieve the full form field labels and any error messages?
  
- Do you need to scroll horizontally to see all content?


### Questions for testing participant: 

- How was your experience filling out the form from the mobile app using your [assistive tech/device]? **1:09 ish**
  Redundant, a lot of time was spent. For what I did, it should've taken me 2 seconds in a few clicks I should've been able to start typing my statement... My experience was fine. I just expected more. 

- Were there any fields where your assistive technology didn't work as expected?
  Field requirements should be specified before an error (SSN, last name)

- What worked well for you?
  Pinch to zoom in webview - that was the highlight
  Would like that for the whole app
  When rotating the screen part title is cut off for Submit a statement

- What was unclear for you?
  Done/Go back to link within web view va.gov that he wasn't on
  Respondent obligation time
  My forms - I completed the form but it's still listed in active. In progress means the claim is in progress but not the form. Is the form in progress or the claim?
  Can we have a my forms link within claims?

- How does this compare to filling out forms on VA.gov or other websites?

- What would make this process feel familiar to you?
  Getting denied right in the very beginning
  Felt like a VA form

- If you had to take breaks, where would there be natural stopping points?
  My stopping points or my mom's
  Maybe at the end of each page. It would seem to make sense even though it looked like it was saving.. natrually when you go from one page to the next

 
## Task 6: View submitted form
Now that you have completed the form, please go back to the app.


### Questions for testing participant: 
- Based on what you see now, how do you know the form was submitted? 

- What does this status mean to you? 

- If you needed to reference this form submission in a phone call with VA, what information would you look for?
  Would look for the email sent to me with all of the info on it. No way to tell which is the most complete form

- What would you expect to see if you needed to check on your submission later?
  

- How would you expect to be notified of updates to this form?
  Email and coming back to forms - assuming completed and active aren't for me, they're for adminstrative. Should be in with the rest of the claims





### Watch for:
- In this step, what did the participant expect to happen?

 - Did they mention any previous experience or confusion?

- Does the user express confidence that they have completed and submitted their form?

 - If no, what is confusing to them and why?

- Does the user understand the status of the form?

 - If not, what do confusion do they express when interpretting the form status?


### Deleting the testing app:
Now that we have completed the study today I'm going to assist you with deleting the VA testing app from your device. 

**iOS users:** 
If you navigate to your device home screen, and engage the menu screen of the VA testing app we used today select 'Delete app'. Remove from device.

**Android users:***

1. We now need to ensure you turn off the developer options we turned on for the test from the "Google Play Store".
2. Navigate back to ‚ÄúGoogle Play Store‚Äù
3. Select ‚Äúuninstall‚Äù
4. Go back to the main phone home screen, lower menu bar select square in the middle.
5. Swipe up to remove Google Play Store window

7. Click on your name in the top right 
8. Settings > General > Click on the ‚ÄúDeveloper options‚Äù > Toggle off ‚ÄúInternal app sharing‚Äù
9. Go to settings on phone > scroll to bottom > click on developer options > Toggle on top for on/off > Toggle off (it will obscure the screen because of screen share)
10. Go back one, there should be no developer mode.
11. Reinstall the VA app

(hint: to switch browser windows the user can select the three lines III in the bottom left corner of their lower nav. menu)

## Thank You and Closing - 3 minutes

- How was this process overall for you?
  **Felt antiquated, older, would give it a 6-7 out of 10 because I was able to do it. If I had to choose, I'd do it on the website.**


- Was there anything you would change about this process?
  **Restructure and regroup it - should be under claims**


- What parts required the most concentration?
 ** Color scheme is familiar and it's atrocious, font colors**

- Do you feel you would like to complete forms using the mobile app in the future? Why or why not?
  **I'm a little old school. Would have to screenshot everything because he can't print from phone**


**Are you still okay if we use any video or audio clips from this session?** 
- *(yes / no)*
- *(If participant says yes)* Is there any part of our discussion that you would NOT want shared in a video clip?

**We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today**. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to learn about Veterans so we can improve the online tools that we provide. 

If you know any other Veterans or family members who might be willing to participate in a future research session like this one, you can pass along the web link that you'll receive in your email from our team. 

Thank you so much again, and I hope that you enjoy the rest of your day!

# Emergency Exit üö®

We have covered all the questions I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback!
