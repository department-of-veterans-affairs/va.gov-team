	# Research Plan for [VA Flagship Mobile Team, VAHB Mobile App, June, 2025]

## Background 🏗️
Briefly describe the background of your product.
	
The VA Mobile App team recently resolved SSO issues that had previously prevented Veterans from accessing VA.gov within a web view while maintaining their authenticated state. 

This technical improvement creates a new opportunity to integrate the Forms feature into the mobile app, functionality that is not currently available in the mobile experience. 

As part of the MVP, the app introduces the form 4138, a widely used form, in the mobile app so Veterans can: 
1. Complete VA forms in a secure web view from a mobile device; and
2. Check status of these forms in the mobile app


### [OCTO-DE Priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202025.md) 

This research supports the following OCTO priorities: 

Objective 1: VA’s digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.
  
- Key Result 1: Improve satisfaction with our web and mobile products by 5 points.



### [Veteran Journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)

The research covers broad spectrum of VA services, and applies at ALL stages of the Veteran journey. From serving through death.


## Research Goals 🥅	
The key objective of this study is to evaluate the usability of completing a VA form in a webview from the VA Health and Benefits app. 
Additionally, the research aims to uncover the following:
1. Understand if Veterans can find and interact with forms from the app.
2. Identify if Veterans can fill out a form from the app on their own.
3. Identify any usability issues Veterans may experience when interacting with forms on the mobile app.
4. Identify if Veterans can start a form and come back to it at a later time to complete.

  
### Outcome
The results of the study will help us determine if Veterans are able to fill out and complete forms from the mobile app and to identify any pain points. This will inform future form development on the app.


### Research questions
**Research goal #1: Understand if Veterans can find and interact with forms from the app.**

1. How easily can Veterans locate the forms section within the mobile app?
2. What steps do Veterans take to start a new form from within the app?
3. Are there any points of confusion or difficulty when Veterans attempt to find forms?

**Research goal #2: Identify if Veterans can fill out a form from the app on their own.**

4. Can Veterans independently complete all required fields in a form using the mobile app?
5. Do Veterans understand the instructions and language used in the forms?
6. How do Veterans interpret the status of the form once the form is submitted?

**Research goal #3: Identify any usability issues Veterans may experience when interacting with forms on the mobile app.**

7. What challenges, if any, do Veterans encounter while entering information into the forms?
8. What, if any, technical or design barriers prevent Veterans from successfully interacting with forms?
9. How do Veterans feel about the overall experience of using forms in the mobile app?

**Research goal #4: Identify if Veterans can start a form and come back to it at a later time to complete.**

10. Can Veterans locate and resume a form they previously started in the mobile app?
11. Do Veterans encounter any challenges or confusion when attempting to access and complete a saved or in-progress form?
12. What steps do Veterans take to find and finish a form they started earlier?
13. Are there any barriers that prevent Veterans from successfully submitting a previously started form through the app?

### Hypotheses

**Research goal #1: Understand if Veterans can find and interact with forms from the app.**

1. Veterans will be able to easily locate the forms section within the mobile app without extensive guidance.
2. Veterans will be able to follow the intended navigation steps to start a new form from within the app.
3. Some Veterans may experience confusion or difficulty due to unclear labeling or navigation options related to forms.

**Research goal #2: Identify if Veterans can fill out a form from the app on their own.**

4. Most Veterans will be able to independently complete all required fields in a form using the mobile app.
5. The instructions and language used in the forms will be clear and understandable to Veterans.
6. Some Veterans may experience confusion interpretting the status of the form after submission.

**Research goal #3: Identify any usability issues Veterans may experience when interacting with forms on the mobile app.**

7. Veterans may encounter difficulty entering information into forms from their mobile device.
8. Technical or design barriers, such as small touch targets or required page scrolling, may add additional frustration for Veterans when completing forms from a mobile device.
9. Veterans will have mixed feelings about the overall experience, with some expressing frustration regarding usability issues and others finding the process straightforward.

**Research goal #4: Identify if Veterans can start a form and come back to it at a later time to complete.**

10. Veterans will be able to locate and resume a form they previously started within the mobile app.
11. Barriers such as difficulty finding saved forms or unclear resumption instructions will prevent some Veterans from successfully submitting a previously started form.
  
## Methodology  🛠️

This study will use **remote moderated usability testing** to observe Veterans completing two form flows from within the mobile app. Participants will complete tasks while sharing their screen via Zoom on their mobile device. We will be using a **GitHub Codespace** to simulate the environment and enable accessibility features for participants who may be using screen readers or screen magnifiers.

During the usability testing following flows will be observed:
- Completing a new Form 4138 through the in-app webview
- Continuing an in-progress form from the mobile app
  

### Location

## Timeline 🗓️
> [!NOTE]
> **Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person.** 

### Optional Kick-off Call with Perigean

- `Suggested dates and times:` **[Enter dates and times MM/DD HH:MM]**

### Prepare
*When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).*

**A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session.** 
> [!NOTE]
> **Send pilot participant email in study Slack channel**

- `Pilot participant name:` **[Enter name]**
- `Date and time of pilot session:` **[Enter time]** 

### Research sessions
- `Planned dates of research:` **[Enter dates MM/DD-MM/DD]**

### Length of sessions
- `Session length: **60 minutes**
- `Maximum Sessions per day: **4 sessions**

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. 

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S. 

> [!TIP]
> Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. **(e.g. 3/17, Monday 9:00AM-1:00PM, 3:00PM-6:00PM EST; 3/18, Tuesday 9:00AM-6:00PM EST, etc.;** ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
