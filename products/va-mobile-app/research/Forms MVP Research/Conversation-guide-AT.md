# Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is **Christine**. How are you doing today?

I have a colleague with us in this session who will be taking notes **Notetaker First Name** and our accessibility specialist **AT Specialist First Name** will be on the call available to provide support with any technical issues that may arise with your use of assistive technology should you need it.

There are a few of my teammates who would like to observe this session as well. **Would it be OK with you if I invited them to join us?**
- *(If participant seems hesitant or unsure or uncomfortable)* Just so you know, my teammates will be muted and off camera and you won't have to interact with them. You also have the option to keep the session just the two of us plus the notetaker (and the technical support person).
- *(If yes, let them in--3-4 MAX. If no, post to #feedback-backchannel "Sorry, the participant doesn't want any observers in this session.")*

- *(OBSERVERS JOIN w/cameras ON )* We have a few people from the team listening in today: there's [NAME] *(wave or say "hi")*, [NAME] *(wave or say "hi")*, etc. *(If I don't know the name of one of the observers, ask them to please turn on their camera and say their name aloud)*

Could the observers please turn their cameras off now to save bandwidth? 

Today we're going to talk about filling out forms from the VA mobile app. I'm going to ask you a few questions, and then I'll have you do some specific tasks using the VA Health & Benefits App. As you go through these steps please speak aloud your thoughts and actions to help us understand more about your experience.

Before we start, I want to go over a few things:

- **This entire session may take 90 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
  
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. We're testing an app to learn how we can make it easier to use. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** Whether or not you choose to participate will not affect your benefits with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Just let me know.

- Finally, I would like to record my screen and audio to confirm that I‚Äôve captured your opinions accurately and sometimes share video clips with our colleagues at the VA to show user feedback. If we do this, we don‚Äôt link anything you choose to share in the session to any information that identifies you, and we remove your face and name from any videos that we share.
**Knowing this, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**
  - *(If yes:)* Once I start recording, I am going to confirm once more that you are ok with me recording this session.

‚û°Ô∏è Select **Record**, then **Record to the cloud**.

*(If participant asks you to NOT record)* Are you comfortable if I save the transcript of the session? *(If not, take good notes!)*

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: 
  - **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?** Yes / No
 
  - **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners as long as we remove any information that can be used to identify you?** Yes / No

*Moderator: In the bottom toolbar of the Zoom window, click the arrow next to **SHOW CAPTIONS** > **View Full Transcript** > Save (NEED TO DO THIS TO GET TRANSCRIPT)*

*After checking that transcription is working, close the Transcript panel by clicking **Close Full Transcript** in the Show Captions menu.*


## Troubleshooting
- [Avoid **AI Companion**, which is a new option next to ‚ÄúShare‚Äù in the Zoom buttons]

- [If see **unpredictable jumping around** behavior and participant is using a browser other than Chrome, ask them to switch to Chrome (this helped with VoiceOver on an iPhone using Safari)]

- [If having **difficulty moving windows around** or opening the prototype, you could request control of the participant‚Äôs screen and mouse in Zoom: `<Name>‚Äôs screen tab > Request remote control`. Then you can move/resize browser (but not zoom windows/buttons) and type into browser bar. The participant may need to minimize the zoom video view, and drag the zoom buttons to the bottom of the screen so out of the way.]

# Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Let‚Äôs start with a few questions... 

1. I understand you are a Veteran. Is that right?

# User Tasks

## Task 0: Share screen

I would like you to share your screen with me so that I can see what you do during this session. Before we start, I want to make sure you know that screen share will show me your whole screen, so if you'd like to close any apps or turn off notifications that you don't want me to see, you could do that now.
- *(refer to Screen sharing instructions above, if needed)*
- *STOP TECH TROUBLESHOOTING **< 15 min into session** if want a replacement participant from Perigean b/c not likely to be successful*

We can help guide you through sharing your screen when you're ready if you'd like assistance. Please say what you're doing out loud so that if there are any issues, we'll know what they are.
1. Make sure that the Zoom application has focus
2. Navigate to the screen share button (may need to tap on mobile device to display the menu at the bottom, may have to scroll over to see menu options).
3. Check the "share sound" checkbox (so we can hear their screen reader speaking)--may have to tab a LOT to get to this in the right pane
4. Activate the screen share

**(If video window is covering up phone screen)** It looks like my zoom video is covering up a lot of your screen. Could you please swipe it off? (Screen reader: swipe right until the video window has focus, and then double tap when you hear "Stash preview".)

## Task 1: Login to the VA Health and Benefits mobile app
[start on the VA Health and Benefits mobile app version: 2.56.1.QA (2903)]

I'd like you to take a look at this screen, and sign in.

[When they get to the homepage:] Any data used throughout this test is not your real data or connected to your VA account in any way. This is a test environment with artifical testing data displayed only. 

**For screen magnifier participants.**
[Confirm you're seeing what they are seeing by asking them] "What is on your screen now?

Are you seeing the participants screen magnified at all? 

If not, ask the participant to check their settings on their device by navigating to...

### Question for testing participant:

- Before we start, what do you expect this process to be like?
  

Thank you for sharing that, You may begin the task to submit a statement in support of a new disability claim for yourself.

*Allow the user to navigate to and through the form on their own without guiding them through the happy path. 

### If the user gets lost...

On a path that isn't fully built out and is stuck, you can offer the 'Apple' button at the top to jump them to the forms section of the app.


### Watch for:
