### Summary of overall feedback 

During the month of September users overwhelming rated the app with high satisfaction due to convenience, ease of use, and core features. Users expressed appreciation for streamlined processes, quick access to medical and benefit information, and secure messaging for improving communication with medical providers. 

 
Regarding newly promoted feature Travel Pay, fourteen users reported difficulties with locating it within the app, while those that did successfully submit a travel reimbursement claim loved how quick and easy it was. 

Noted issues this month included sign-in loops reported by Android users, a change in messaging list options where needed providers were no longer available, and an inconsistency or lack of detail when viewing appointment information. 

Suggestions for improvement focused on a need for consistency in detailed appointment information for both community care and VA appointments, as well as a desire to enable users to search for needed medical care providers and further manage their messages. There is a need to improve findability for new features and existing areas of the app such as travel pay, secure messaging, and sign out. This feedback reflects a mix of satisfaction and constructive criticism, offering clear priorities for future updates and refinements to the app.

| = 5 | 62% | 293 | 

 

Positive reviews of the app this month consistently praised the app’s convenience, easy usability, and simple design in supporting tasks like managing appointments, prescriptions, and accessing medical records. Users appreciated the streamlined navigation and quick access to essential features, noting that the app made their interactions with VA services more efficient and satisfying. 

  

#### Representative responses: 

  

> The App is Good. Easy to log in. Easy to file travel vouchers. Easy to do everything that I need to do. 

  

<br> 

  

> Honestly really good. For all the things people hold against the VA, the app for me works flawlessly. I don't have any sort of errors or issues that have occurred. You can do most things you need to do with relative ease. Credit to the team that has made the app and continue to update and rework it to make it more useful. =) 

  

<br> 
 
> I didn't know this app had all these simple, effective and informative features! I've been missing out on my travel reimbursement for IDK, a decade. 
 
<br> 
 
> This app has changed my life if I can't get to my doctor I can let them know what is going on with me without having to go thru hurdles I remember when my nurse a long time ago was asking me if I had this app and I'm like no that is stupid well I was wrong this app is amazing.

### Negative 

| Rating | % of ratings | # of ratings | 
|--|--|--| 
| = 1 | 15% | 69 | 
| = 2 | 6 | 28 | 

 

Most commonly negative reviews are directly linked to errors that prevent users from completing a task or accessing needed information. Notable errors this month were issues with sign in looping Android ID.me users back to sign in again and never getting them to the app. Also notable, a change in messaging provider lists that prevented some users from connecting to their medical team, and some users reported discrepancy in information reflected on the website versus what is shown in the app. Other negative feedback reflected difficulty locating specific features new users were looking to access from the app such as messaging, travel pay, and at times the app failing to load.  

  

#### Representative responses: 

  

> 2.58.0 version doesn’t work. Keeps saying it is loading the app but never does. My wife has previous version on her phone and it still works fine. I deleted mine and tried again. Same issue. 

<br> 

  

> Cannot get to travel pay section. 

  

<br> 
 
> I used to be able send messages to my local VA Medical Center, but as of last update, I only have 4 choices nowhere near me, and not my normal location. I can send one in the web browser just fine. Uninstalled on my phone. 
 
<br> 
 
> Really bad. Does not match web site for claims letters. Some requests for evidence letters show here, some requests on website. ARGH! The benefits people do not send all letters, and neither site is comprehensive. You need to check the app, the website and your mailbox. Calling the VA help line doesn't help. They cannot deal with there is a system problem. Argh! Put a feedback form with dropdown and text in the app. Read the feedback. The app, mail and website need to draw authoritative system. 
 
<br> 
 
> App doesn't always open. currently displaying a mix of old and current info. deleted my medical contacts for messaging after app was updated. when it works, it's helpful. Seems few and far between though. 
 
<br> 

  

### Neutral 

| Rating | % of ratings | # of ratings | 
|--|--|--| 
| = 3 | 8% | 36 | 

 

Veterans who rated the app with a three appreciate the app improvements and convenience for accessing information and submitting requests, but they encounter recurring issues with sign-in, navigation, appointment details, secure messaging, and travel pay features. Some users don’t see the value in the app based on its current content and features. Veterans suggest more intuitive design, clearer information, and streamlined processes to better meet their needs. 

  

#### Representative responses: 

  

> This site has potential.  
 
<br> 
 
> Great Idea for better access, but plenty of flaws. Biggest frustration is that in secure messages sometimes you can't open or download a file sent by the provider. Also, why do we have to go through ALL the security checks to sometimes get faced with an update. Why can't we just get the update before all the security measures? Another problem is that in secure message, not all of my providers show up so that I can message them. 

  

<br> 

  

> I don't see the same value in this app that l get from the website on my pc. 

  

<br> 
 
> The app works well, a little confusing at first, but relatively easy to use once you've been on it a few times, HOWEVER, please, put more info in the appointments section. Tell us what the appointments are for. Letters get lost, sometimes it's an appointment that may need to be rescheduled if it's not extremely important. Sometimes it's an important one or we may need a driver. Put what clinic the appointment is for. It's missing in just about every single appointment I have scheduled. 
 
<br> 
 
> I’m supposed to be able to input for travel but I can’t, it’s not available. It's a short cut to a website that's not helpful either fix it or delete it. 
 
<br>

### Navigation 

| Feature | average rating | # of ratings | 
|--|--|--| 
| Navigation | 4.5 | 14 | 

Users often mention navigation specifically as a reason the app is so easy to use, and their needed information is so accessible to them. Newer users often mention a slight learning curve but find the app easy to navigate once they are familiar with it. Common concerns with navigation include the inability to locate key features that may be nested in unexpected places. Specifically secure messaging, travel pay within appointments, and occasionally users report that sign-out feels buried under settings within the users profile. 
 
#### Pain Points 

1. Locating travel pay (14) 

2. Locating secure messaging (7) 

3. Sign-out is hard to find (2) 
 
#### Themes 

1.  Easy to navigate (13) 

 

#### Recommendations 

Highlight new app features on the homepage, link directly to new feature location. 

Consider a search or guide that users can utilize to locate features they have trouble finding. 

  

#### Representative Responses: 

  

> This app is very user-friendly once you get it set up and remember your sign in information. I suggest using it regularly as I found out I was missing messages because I was only checking it every couple of months instead of a couple of times a week. I had to play around with it for a few minutes to figure out how to navigate the sites, but it didn't take too long. I highly recommend that anyone utilizing the VA or VA benefits download this app for their use. 

  

<br> 

  

> I can't find what I need on this stupid app. I need secure messaging. It's not available. Why is that and where is it? Why you people make things so difficult for us? 

 

<br> 
 
>  Easy navigation, right to everything I need. 
 
<br> 
 
> This app is designed to discourage older veterans as it is impossible to navigate! Can't find where to enter mileage for re-imbursement! 

 

<br> 

  

### Sign In 

| Feature | average rating | # of ratings | 
|--|--|--| 
|Sign In | 2.5 | 43 | 

Veterans frequently experience frustrating and unreliable sign-in processes with the VA app, including looping login screens, repeated authentication requests, and frequent changes in required login methods. While some users report improvements with biometric login, many find it difficult to stay signed in or access their accounts, leading some to abandon the app entirely. 
 
#### Pain Points 
1. Sign in loops effecting Android users throughout the month (23) 

2. Biometric enablement not being retained (2) 

3. Option to remember me for sign in doesn’t remember users (2) 

4. Sign in process being difficult (6) 
5. Being signed out unexpectedly (4) 

 

#### Themes 
1. Sign in improvements appreciated (2) 

2. Mobile sign in is easier than web sign in (2) 

 

#### Recommendations 

 1. Investigate Android user looping issue to resolve. 

 

#### Representative Responses: 

  

> Infinite loop sign in. I sign in and get taken back to the VA website login. every time. I hear it's a nice app, but not if you can't get to the app itself. 
 
<br> 
 
> Signing in procedure is much quicker, and sense of the security protocol is more reliable. 

  

<br> 

  

> If you set up biometrics you don't have to go through ID. Me Everytime you want to log in. I just recently found this out after setting up my new cellular device. being able to send secure messages to all of my providers, requesting my medication, viewing my documents for base commissary etc. all in one place is so nice! 

  

<br> 
 
> PLS Provide Large Numerical Keyboards to type in Security and other Codes. 
 
<br> 
 
> The app works so great now!!! It used to take a gory, leap-year-harvest-moon-midnight sacrifice to log in, but is now instantaneous!! All the basic VIP info is up front for quick reference. Thank you! 
 
<br> 
 
> The app will let me log in with my biometrics for a few weeks and then randomly ask me to log in with an email address but not auto populate the login credentials that I had saved. It's very inconvenient to always have to make a new account because of the app not working properly. Other times the app just does not work, it says to log in and try again later. 
 
<br> 

   

### Claims 

| Feature | average rating | # of ratings | 
|--|--|--| 
| Claims | 5 | 4 | 

Only three reviews during the month of September mentioned claims specifically and all gave the app a 5 star rating. Users find it very quick and easy to access claims information from the app, mentioned specifically liking the format and ability to upload documents from the app.  

#### Themes: 

Quick and easy (3)  

Improved claims processing speed (1) 
 

#### Representative responses: 

  

> So far I really like this app. I started my claim process and after some time of finally being able to understand the VA snail mail, I discovered this app. I was able to upload all my documents and complete my claim in weeks about 8wks start to finish. HEY SOLDIER, KEEP A COPY OF THEM MEDICAL RECORDS 

  

<br> 

  

> It's very quick and easy to file your claim . 

  

<br> 
 
> Va app is very easy to use, the format is outstanding . Managing claims is very easy and informing. Va app is what every needs and should have downloaded on their phone 
 
<br> 
 
> The level of care and accessibility to it and all of my providers has been surprisingly seamless. And the speed with which my disability claims are being processed seems to be improving significantly. The app makes things considerably easier on all fronts. 
 
<br> 

  

### Letters and documents 

| Feature | average rating | # of ratings | 
|--|--|--| 
| Letters and documents | 1.75 | 4 | 

Veterans are frustrated by inconsistencies between the VA app, website, and mail, as important claims and decision letters are missing or scattered across platforms, requiring them to check multiple sources. The lack of comprehensive access and unresolved system problems leads to dissatisfaction. 
 
#### Pain Points 

Claim letters not all available from the app (2) 

Glitches when attempting to open claim letters (1) 

Unable to locate proof of insurance under letters (1) 

  

#### Representative Responses: 

  

> Does not match web site for claims letters. Some request for evidence letters show here, some on website. ARGH! The benefits people do not send all letters, and neither site is comprehensive. You need to check the app, the website and your mailbox. Calling the VA help line doesn't help. 

 

<br> 
 
> Not happy with it. can't review any decision letters and glitches. 
 
<br> 
 
> What happened to the proof of insurance under letters - for proof of VA healthcare? Thank you for adding on Travel Pay request. Great App! 
 
<br> 

  

> Really bad. Does not match web site for claims letters. Some requests for evidence letters show here, some requests on website. ARGH! The benefits people do not send all letters, and neither site is comprehensive. You need to check the app, the website and your mailbox. Calling the VA help line doesn't help. They cannot deal with there is a system problem. Argh! Put a feedback form with dropdown and text in the app. Read the feedback. The app, mail and website need to draw authoritative system. 

  

<br> 

  

### Profile 

| Feature | average rating | # of ratings | 
|--|--|--| 
| Profile | 4.2 | 5 | 

Veterans appreciate the VA mobile app as a convenient, modern way to access their information, likening it to an "I Love Me" binder for personal records. However, they find certain functions—such as signing out, updating profile details, and changing contact information—confusing or difficult to navigate. 

 
#### Pain Points: 

Sign out is hard to find (1) 

Adding a profile photo (1) 

Difficulty updating phone number (1) 

 

#### Themes: 

All needed information together (1) 

#### Recommendations: 

Make sign out easier to locate from the profile menu. 

  

#### Representative Responses: 

  

> In the military during my time it was always suggested to have an "I Love Me" Binder. This would hold awards, certifications, merits, qualifications to show when needed. The VA app is a modernized "I Love Me" binder for veterans to access some of their medical and claims history, including military verification and compensation verification. I am a fan. 

  

<br> 

  

> It should not be so difficult to sign out of the app, nevermind find where it is!! 

  

<br> 
 
> I would like to know how to put a photo on profile page? 
 
<br> 
 
> you really have to know what your doing in order to do things like change your phone numbers 
 
<br> 

  

### Payments 

| Feature | average rating | # of ratings | 
|--|--|--| 
| Payments | 3 | 2 | 

Only one Veteran in September mentioned payments specifically and reported being unable to save their banking information in the app requesting assistance to do so. 

  

Representative responses: 
> I’m currently in the transition to retirement and trying to save my banking information in the VA app, but it’s not saving. Could you please assist with troubleshooting this issue or provide guidance on how to resolve it? 
 
<br> 

  

> I've noticed the payment information is not accurate nor up to date, as it shows my last payment was seven years ago. This is all I have to say at this time. I've not used this newer system for very long nor all the components. 

   

### Travel Pay 

| Feature | average rating | # of ratings | 
|--|--|--| 
| Travel Pay | 2 | 22 | 

Veterans have mixed experiences with Travel Pay in the VA mobile app; while some find it easier than previous processes and appreciate features like days remaining reminders attached to their VA appointments, many struggle to locate the travel reimbursement option at all. Of those who struggled to locate it, the majority were new users specifically looking for travel pay after a marketing campaign was launched recently by the VA. Users also request the ability to submit travel reimbursement claims for community care, an important element for rural VA users who rely on community care for a significant portion of their healthcare services. Two user report that the function in the app did not work for them and they were unable to file.  

 

#### Pain Points 

Difficulty locating travel pay in the app (14) 

Inability to submit travel claim for community care appointments (2) 

Unable to successfully submit the travel claim in the app (2) 

#### Themes: 

Travel pay through the app is easier/quicker than previous processes (4) 

  

#### Recommendations: 

Travel pay is currently accessible only through applicable appointments in the app. Users who are seeking it specifically may not know to look under appointments. Providing a notification about where to find Travel Pay, or a link from the homepage of the app may help users locate the feature. 

Travel pay is a desirable feature that may warrant a specific section of its own, outside of appointments where users could manually request travel pay for both VA and community care appointment types. 

#### Representative Responses: 

  

> It's an excellent app that gives one an opportunity to communicate with providers. Also, it's wonderful to file your travel claims on there, too. There's a section that will remind you of how many days one has to file their claims. Overall, having the ability to see past and future appointments, communicate with providers, file claims, and see results of tests is quite useful when it comes to this app. I highly recommend downloading the app. 

  

<br> 

  

> So much easier than using a browser. Get it and use it. I received an email stating that milage can be easily claimed. I can't find anything about milage. still a great app 

  

<br> 
 
> I have been using MyhealthEVet for over 10 years. The new upgrades are nice, but there is no way to enter travel pay requests for community care providers. None of the tabs allow you to input a manual request, nor is there an automated option. In VA care is not an issue, only when seeing community providers. Unfortunately, most of my appointments are with community providers as I live in a very rural area with a very small CBOC, and I'm 5 hours from the closest VAMC. 
 
<br> 
 
> the travel reimbursement doesn't work for me. 
 
<br> 
 
> Will this be fixed? Multiple complaints on Reddit. For those looking for how to file for travel, it’s buried under Appointments then Past Appointments. Other wise a pretty good app. 

 <br> 

 

### Messaging 

| Feature | average rating | # of ratings | 
|--|--|--| 
| Messaging | 3.2 | 33 | 

Veterans find the messaging feature of the VA app convenient and helpful for communicating with their care teams, noting quick responses and improved ease compared to previous systems. However, many report frustrations with accessing secure messaging, difficulty composing or deleting messages, and changes after updates that limit their ability to reach the correct providers or use the feature reliably. New users often report difficulty locating messaging once they are in the app.   
 
#### Pain Points 

Not finding needed providers (9) 

Locating messaging within the app (5) 

Not being able to delete messages (2) 

Difficulty creating a new message (1) 

Inability to send messages (1) 

Message composition times out (1) 

Inability to open or download files in messages (1) 

Not getting responses back from messages sent (1) 

 

#### Themes 

Messaging in the app is easy and efficient. (6) 

Improves communication between Veteran and medical care team (3) 

Desire to delete messages (2) 

Desire to manage messages through custom folders (1) 

### Recommendations 

Allow users to search or manually connect to needed medical centers and care professionals. 

Direct users to messaging from the homepage of the application. Users don’t always look under the health tab to find messages. 

 

##### Representative Responses: 

  

>  This app has changed my life if I can't get to my doctor I can let them know what is going on with me without having to go thru hurdles I remember when my nurse a long time ago was asking me if I had this app and I'm like no that is stupid well I was wrong this app is amazing. 
 
<br> 
 

> Only a handful of past care teams and none of my current teams show in the drop down so Iame forced to use VA.gov for any messaging. 

  

<br> 

  

> Not so great, I cannot send an email to with this wonderful app, HST or Iowa city are not on a list to send emails to 

  

<br> 
 
> After an update, it removed the ability to email your clinics and providers from the app as well as deleted your entire mailbox 
 
<br> 
 
> Some of us older vets need a longer period of time to get our thoughts down in our messages. 
 
<br> 

  

### Prescriptions 

| Feature | average rating | # of ratings | 
|--|--|--| 
| Prescriptions | 4 | 18 | 

Veterans provided mixed feedback on the VA mobile app’s Prescription feature, praising its ease of use and convenience for ordering refills but expressing frustration with confusing navigation, unclear refill submission steps, outdated payment and prescription information, and issues with medication tracking. Suggestions included making the refill process more intuitive, displaying prescribing doctors, and improving accuracy and timeliness of information. 

 

#### Pain Points 

Missing desired information (prescribing doctor, RX bill access) (2) 

Medication list not current (1) 

Difficulty with delivery and tracking (1) 

Difficult or confusing process (1) 

Functionality not working (1) 

#### Themes 

Quick or easy way to refill prescriptions (9) 

Appreciation for service (3) 

Speed of service timely (1) 

 

#### Recommendations 

Consider additional information reflecting in the app as related to medications such as adding prescribing doctor and providing access to copies of prescription bills. 

 

  

#### Representative Responses: 

  

> Filling my prescriptions is so much easier using the VA APP. 

 

<br> 

 

> I'd like the pharmacy refills to show which doctor prescribed the medication. That way, I'd know which doctor to discuss the dosages or to stop the medication, etc.  

<br> 

  

> Prescription function never works. Elevated a troubleshooting ticket and it has been over 3 months since they said it will resolve after the transition. Very unhelpful when trying to keep track of ordering via the app.. 

  

<br> 
 
> I think the medication portal whether in this app or on va.gov myhealthyVet. If I can't check my medicine properly what good is it. why do I have things in tracking I got two weeks ago? this is the second month My pain meds were sent to the pharmacy instead of being mailed but the point is IF IT'S MAILED LOCALLY I SHOULD BE ABLE TO TRACK IT WHETHER IT'S LOCAL OR ACROSS THE COUNTRY ANOTHER MONTH I WAITED FOR IN THE MAIL AND I DIDN'T GET IT AND I'M OUT OF MEDS. GET THE TRACKING CORRECTED 
 
<br> 
 
> I think the refill Rx screen needs work. If I'm already viewing my Rx,I shouldn't have to click a button to go to the refill screen as I should be able to select the meds I want to refill. Also, the submit process isn't very user friendly. It wasn't very clear that when I clicked submit or whatever it said, another menu appeared and I had to click that to submit it but that text didn't look like a button as it was the same color. the former online version was better in some regards than this. 
 
<br> 
 
> The prescription refills are not current, making it very difficult to know when to order refills. 
 
<br> 
 

  

### Appointments 

 

| Feature | average rating | # of ratings | 
|--|--|--| 
| Appointments | 3.26 | 23 | 

 
Users appreciate accessing appointments from the app but frequently mention a lack of needed information about the appointment details. Additional feature requests for appointments includes the ability to book or cancel appointments directly from the app. 

 

#### Pain Points 

Lack of needed appointment details (16) 

Not up-to-date (1) 

Appointment wait time (2) 

Need to cancel appointments (2) 

Feature not working (1) 

Instructions listed for appointment preparation inaccurate (1) 

Difficult to perceive/distinguish (1) 

#### Themes 

1. Desire to book appointments (4) 

2. Appreciated feature (1) 
 
#### Recommendations 

1. Investigate issues with appointment details varying and improve detail reflected in the app. 

2. Consider future feature additions of booking or canceling appointments directly in the app. 

 
 
#### Representative Responses: 
 
> I am VERY satisfied with my VA experience. everyone is very helpful, polite and professional! I only wish that there were more information shown on the app about upcoming appointments, i.e., who my appointment is with. Is it a follow-up? A Primary? Specialist? Doctor's/ Clinic's name would be very helpful! The two clinics I usually deal with are large campuses. A bit difficult to remember just who, and why I'm seeing them. 
 
<br> 
 
> Has made the simple things a lot easier my all my letters are at the tap of my hand along with when my appointments are. She only thing is I wish I could make appointments from the app. I am guessing that is something that has been thought of and not figured out yet. Other than that has made my experience with the VA that much easier to navigate. 
 
<br> 
 
> When reviewing appointments, you have black text on a white background for canceled and confirmed appointments status. Please use a color coded background. For example, for a canceled appointment use a yellow or red background with bold black text, for a confirmed appointment use a green or blue background with bold black text. 
 
<br> 
 
> Minimal capabilities. It's essentially an app for showing you information you already know. It requires you to log in through the website anyway if you need to do anything more detailed. There's not a place to make appointments outside of sending a message to your care team. They can really add some more functionality to this app. 
 
<br> 
 
> Appointments are not kept up to date. Sometimes the pharmacy app can be confusing. 
 
<br> 
 
> I feel like there was a point where we could cancel an appointment via the app. can't do it anymore. they make you call and sit on hold for half an hour just to cancel a damn appointment. 
 
<br> 
 

### Medical Records

Add lab & test results to accessible medical records area

#### Representative Responses: 
 

> If and when you manage to get past the authorization and verification and passwords. Sometimes, I want to know my exact lab or test results. Similar civilian sites are easier to access. 
 
<br> 

 
> Not as good as MyHealtheVet and its missing Radiology and Imaging records that used to be accessible with MyHealtheVet. Disappointing downgrade. 
 
<br> 
 
> It's pretty good. no complaints other than I wish I could see labs, images, etc in app 

 

<br> 

 

> I do not like that I can't seem to get my VA record to download 
 
<br>

### Other pain points 

  

#### Latency (3)

Several users this month reported issues with delays and latency problems.
