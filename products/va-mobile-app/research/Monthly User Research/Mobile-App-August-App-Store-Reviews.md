Representative responses:

> This app is so valuable. I’m thankful that it exists and impressed with its function. It’s easy to use and has so many helpful tools that make accessing VA benefits much easier. Because of this app, I’m more likely to tend to my medical needs. I can easily communicate with my doctor through the app, request medicine, refill medications or check on my other VA benefits. Very thankful to have such an awesome tool in my pocket.

### Negative
| Rating | % of ratings | # of ratings |
|--|--|--|
| = 1 | 22.41% | 80 |
| = 2 | 9.24% | 33 |
The general sentiment is negative, with many users reporting issues with login, navigation, and specific features like travel pay and messaging. Some users also express frustration with the app's limited functionality and the need to use the website for certain tasks.

Representative responses:

> This app is terrible it does not have the updated travel claim that is supposed have. It was the main reason for the new “great” app. To top it off it’s says this update has Been online for 2weeks.

<br>

> VA is putting information out publicly about being able to make travel claims through this app. Well I’m here to tell you there is no such thing as making a travel claim on this app. VA needs to remove all such information saying this until it’s proven that it is in the app to make a travel claim.

<br>

### Neutral
| Rating | % of ratings | # of ratings |
|--|--|--|
| = 3 | 11.48% | 41 |
The general sentiment is neutral, with many users acknowledging the app's potential but also pointing out areas for improvement. Some users find the app useful for certain tasks but still lacking in functionality compared to the website.

Representative responses:

> Manually added CC appointments and associated travel claims are not depicted.

<br>

> Don’t see where I can submit a travel claim. Also there is no option to anywhere to dispute an erroneous travel claim amount.

<br>

### Common themes

#### Login issues after update (50)

Many users reported login issues after a recent app update, with some being directed to a test site or receiving error messages. This caused frustration and prevented users from accessing their accounts.

Representative responses:

> Everything was great until the recent update. Now it won’t let me log on. It just constantly pending but never does anything.

<br>

> It was really good! Downloaded the update and now I can’t sign in. I deleted the app, resigned in and then it asked if I wanted to use Face ID? Ok, then I have to re-sign in again. It goes back to the gateway error number 504 I think! Can’t use the app!

<br>

Recommendation: The development team should investigate the login issues caused by the recent update and release a fix as soon as possible. Clear communication about the issue and its resolution should be provided to users.

#### Travel claim submission problems (30)

Several users reported difficulties with travel claim submissions, including the inability to find the travel claim feature within the app, problems with direct deposit information, and general frustration with the process.

Representative responses:

> The latest version of the app says a travel claim can be completed within the app, but in the health section, I do not see anywhere to submit a travel claim . Is it connected to a an appointment after the appointment is complete?

<br>

> VA travel pay direct deposit is still unchangeable. The app does allow you to file a mileage claim, but there is no way to update your VA travel pay direct deposit info. It gives you a sign in error when you try to access that section and crashes and calling the number listed for the VA travel pay vendor gets you a human that sends you to the travel pay clerk at your regional VA.

<br>

Recommendation: The app's interface for travel claim submissions should be reviewed and improved to ensure it is user-friendly and easy to navigate. Clear instructions and troubleshooting tips should be provided within the app.

### User pain points

#### Login difficulties
Many users struggle with the login process, citing issues with ID.me, two-factor authentication, and general difficulty remembering passwords. This is a major pain point, as it prevents users from accessing the app's features.

Recommendation: Simplify the login process by offering more biometric options and improving the integration with ID.me. Provide clear instructions and support for users experiencing login issues.
