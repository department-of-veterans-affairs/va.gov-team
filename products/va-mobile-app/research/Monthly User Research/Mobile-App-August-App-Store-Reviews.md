## General/other feedback
Note: General feedback includes responses that reflect Veteran experiences with their healthcare teams, or the VA in general and may not specifically be related to the VA Health & Benefits app. 

### Summary of overall feedback
The August 2025 feedback for the VA Health & Benefits app reveals a polarized distribution of ratings with 42% of responses giving the app a 5 star rating, while the second highest percentage of ratings at 22% rate the app as 1 star. While many users appreciate the app's convenience and ease of use for managing their healthcare and benefits, a significant number report issues with login, navigation, and specific features like travel pay, appointments, and messaging as detailed below. 

An incident involving an incorrectly linked staging environment appeared to have temporarily caused login problems for some users directly impacting the lower rating scores, with a significant portion of negative feedback received relating to the login issue on August 12th. Another issue impacting the travel pay API mid-August was also directly linked to both neutral and negative ratings as many users reported issues finding or using the newly marketed travel pay feature in the app. Despite these temporary issues, many users praise the app for its improvements over previous versions.

### Positive
The majority of the received reviews, although only a slight majority at roughly 57%, is positive. Many users find the app quick and easy to use noting its simplicity and speed. They also appreciate that it provides a convenient way to manage their healthcare and benefits. Users appreciate the ability to refill prescriptions, check appointments, prove their status, track payments, submit travel reimbursements, and communicate with their care teams.

Representative responses:

> This app is so valuable. I’m thankful that it exists and impressed with its function. It’s easy to use and has so many helpful tools that make accessing VA benefits much easier. Because of this app, I’m more likely to tend to my medical needs. I can easily communicate with my doctor through the app, request medicine, refill medications or check on my other VA benefits. Very thankful to have such an awesome tool in my pocket.

<br>

> This app has truly transformed the way I manage my healthcare and benefits as a veteran. It’s user friendly, secure, and packed with features that make managing my appointments and medications very easy. It’s clear the VA is prioritizing digital accessibility and making things more convenient for us.

<br>

> The app is both more intuitive and more reliable than the website. Well done VA techies, I appreciate your thoughtfulness and understanding. Bravo

<br>

> I have been able to communicate with providers at the VA in seconds using this app. Logging in takes under 30 seconds. I have tried for months to login through the old va.gov website and could never access provider messaging (or anything useful )where now using the app, it is not only possible but instant instantaneous and at my fingertips (iPhone)THANK-YOU!👍😎

<br>

> This is the best government app I have ever used. Functionality, ease of use, everything in one location. I was skeptical at first but this is the best thing the VA has done.

<br>

> A fellow Vet and friend just put me on to this VA app and it seems to be very convenient and has everything that I check or need to check on a regular basis, right there. By the time I get home and remember what I wanted or need to do, I forget. Now, I can do what I need to right when I think about it. To whoever made this app Thank You!!!

### Negative

| Rating | % of ratings | # of ratings |
|--|--|--|
| = 1 | 22.41% | 80 |
| = 2 | 9.24% | 33 |

Roughly 32% of the received sentiment rated in the negative, with many users reporting issues with login, navigation, and specific features like travel pay and messaging. Some users also express frustration with the app's limited functionality and the need to use the website for certain tasks. Being sent to the website from the app is frustrating for many. Several incidents this month effecting both login and the travel pay directly impacted the volume of negative ratings and feedback.

Representative responses:

> This app has very limited function. Still requires sending a text to your phone before allowing it to open. Once opened, user will find the app does not allow the user to perform needed tasks.

<br>

> This last update has now disabled my ability to log in, continually dances and then displays 'Time Out' I should have never updated. I finally got in; but no mailbox. Wish I could load the old version.

<br>

> very slow, hard to find information, very difficult to get a full print out of all of your active medications. I like the old healthevet better. I found it much more user-friendly.

<br>

> NOT AN APP- just a link (masquerading as an app) to VA.gov web site. Very disappointing.

<br>

> I tried to check my appointments on the app and at first it wouldn't let me login, then I got a weird message saying that it was a "test" version of the app. Then it told me that something was wrong with the application and to uninstall then reinstall, I did that and I could login but it wouldn't retrieve my appointments, then I tried to login through my Healthevet it was closed it said that it moved to VA.gov. 

<br>

> i find that the new v a id is not reliable becuse there is so many return to the page stuff that i cant be sure of what i am signing into . how do i know that my information is going to the correct place and not some scam.. to many i d stuff cant figure it out why is it keep asking me the same thing

<br>

### Neutral

| Rating | % of ratings | # of ratings |
|--|--|--|
| = 3 | 11.48% | 41 |

Roughly 11% of the sentiment received ranked as neutral, with many users acknowledging the app's potential but also pointing out areas for improvement. Some users find the app useful for certain tasks but still lacking in needed functionality.

Representative responses:

> way too many steps for simple activities. But I do appreciate the added steps for login.

<br>

> constant errors with this app and missing information but it has its uses when using it for Medical.

<br>

> The app is mostly functional, sometimes clunky.

<br>

> While this app is a good tool to have it still needs some added tabs/links to be able to access your inbox to send new secured messages, a tab/link to be able to file mileage reimbursements and a tab/link to request refills on other things like hearing aid supplies and other prosthetic devices

<br>

> I would have given the app 5 stars, but the appointment information is lacking. There is no provider info. When you have multiple appts, you do not know who the appointment is for.

<br>

> great to refill prescriptions and use secure messaging, but fails to deliver on appointments.. In the app I can't see who an appointment is with, only where. May be a DC specific problem, but I have to use the website to find out whether an appointment is with, for example, ortho or pcm. all the app shows is that its at the DC medical center.

<br>

### Common themes

#### General satisfaction/overall impressions (100)

Users often share short, generalized impressions of the app in reviews. With these sentiments skewing towards the positive at an average rating of 4.7 on generalized feedback. Specific functionality challenges are often the most common result of neutral or negative ratings, improving these found issues will likely result in a positive app experience for users. 

> This is app is so valuable. I’m thankful that it exists and impressed with its function.

<br>

> This app is the best thing the VA has done. It’s easy and simple.

<br>

> It is a good app and very easy to use. You can't do everything with the app. The main things one would do can be started or completed in the app.

<br>

> The VA app is getting better over the years. It is not perfect by any means. If they keep working on it I believe it will get close 🤞

<br>

#### Login issues after update (50)

Many users reported login issues after a recent app update, with some being directed to a test site or receiving error messages. This caused frustration and prevented users from accessing their accounts temporarily. The mobile app platform team was able however to roll out an error message quickly with the found issue which directed Veterans to update their app version to receive the fix and correctly sign-in to access their account. However the temporary direction to a staging account was a major cause of confusion and concern for Veterans attempting to access the app during this time. 

Representative responses:

> Took about half a day to recognize and fix an issue. That's worth a five star for the IT department. The app itself does a pretty good job for my needs although there are some issues with my clinic provider not showing up to communicate with.

<br>

> Update: The app was re-updated since my review below. The app worked great before the update. Now, I cannot login. I have double checked and triple checked and then some, but I cannot login through the app anymore. I can login just fine online (on my phone or laptop) but the same credentials are saying that they are incorrect when signing in using ID.ME or the DS Login. I have cleared the cache and data, uninstalled and reinstalled, nothing works. I am currently using an S23 Ultra.

<br>

> It was really good! Downloaded the update and now I can’t sign in. I deleted the app, resigned in and then it asked if I wanted to use Face ID? Ok, then I have to re-sign in again. It goes back to the gateway error number 504 I think! Can’t use the app!

<br>

> Thanks for fixing the login issues with this app. I was finally able to log back in after uninstalling and reinstalling it. This is once again a very good app that allows vets to check on appointments, refill meds, make and receive secure messages, etc. You can even see a record of all vaccinations administered through the VA.

<br>


#### Travel claim submission problems (30)

Several users reported difficulties with travel claims. Issues including the inability to find the travel claim feature within the app, problems with direct deposit information, and general frustration with the process.

Representative responses:

> The latest version of the app says a travel claim can be completed within the app, but in the health section, I do not see anywhere to submit a travel claim. Is it connected to a an appointment after the appointment is complete?

<br>

> VA travel pay direct deposit is still unchangeable. The app does allow you to file a mileage claim, but there is no way to update your VA travel pay direct deposit info. It gives you a sign in error when you try to access that section and crashes and calling the number listed for the VA travel pay vendor gets you a human that sends you to the travel pay clerk at your regional VA.

<br>


### User pain points

#### Login difficulties

Many users struggle with the login process, citing issues with ID.me, two-factor authentication, and general difficulty remembering passwords. Some users also mention getting logged out or having to reauthenticate noting it as an inconveience. Login continues to be a major pain point, as it prevents users from accessing the app's features.

> The app will let me log in with my biometrics for a few weeks and then randomly ask me to log in with an email address but not auto populate the login credentials that I had saved. It's very inconvenient to always have to make a new account because of the app not working properly. Other times the app just does not work, it says to log in and try again later.

<br>

> It has an option to keep you logged in, but it doesn't work. it requires a log in and 2 step verification EVERY TIME.

<br>


#### Maintenance interupting service

Even users with positive ratings tend to note issues with app access or activities during frequent maintenace or updates.

> app is pretty good most id the time. have uploaded documents etc through app with no issues. updates tend to crash it but usually corrected within 24hrs.

<br>

> All in all it's a decent app. You can do most everything VA-related here. They do frequent updates and keep up on maintaining the app. My only complaint is it like to hard kick you out causing a 3-step verification when you were just in it. Sometimes after an update it happens, most of the time not. Again not an issue, more of an inconvenience.

<br>

> Half of the time it works great, other half is always under maintenance.

<br>

> This app is down for maintenance more than anything i've ever seen in my entire life. 

<br>


#### Travel pay findability 

With the newer release and marketing for the travel pay feature in the app, users reported difficulty finding it at all.

> Don’t see where I can submit a travel claim. Also there is no option to anywhere to dispute an erroneous travel claim amount.

<br>

> VA is putting information out publicly about being able to make travel claims through this app. Well I’m here to tell you there is no such thing as making a travel claim on this app.

<br>

> This is a good first step but the travel claim limitation is a big disappointment.

<br>

> The latest version of the app says a travel claim can be completed within the app, but in the health section, I do not see anywhere to submit a travel claim.

### Navigation

| Feature | average rating | # of ratings |
|--|--|--|
| Navigation | 3.6 | 45 |

Navigation is often a strength of the app when mentioned in positive reviews while some users struggle to find specific features or information. Users often compare it to the structure of what they are familiar with using at the VA previously such as MyHealthEVet or Va.gov but after learning the app find it easy to navigate. 

Representative responses:

> Downloaded the app and doggone it’s fast and responsive. Takes a bit getting used to navigating compared to the previous “MyHealthevet” but so far I like it! Bravo

<br>

> The app is both more intuitive and more reliable than the website. Well done VA techies, I appreciate your thoughtfulness and understanding.Bravo

<br>

> Once I got the app figured out, it's very nice and easy to use.

<br>

> Better Yes still much room for improvement with regard to navigation and getting around and finding where things are. It’s far from intuitive!

<br>

> it is very difficult for me to figure out and maneuver

<br>

> Trying to navigate the app and knowing all the details in which to get my prescription setup at the VA has been a very long and trying task

<br>

### Login

| Feature | average rating | # of ratings |
|--|--|--|
|Login | 1.5 | 85 |

Login issues are a significant pain point for many users, with some reporting difficulties with ID.me, two-factor authentication, and general login errors. Recent updates appear to have exacerbated these issues. Users that express positive login sentiment appreciate the easier methods of signing in native functionality offers and the fewer steps offered from the app. 

Representative responses:

> This is awesome. No more, numerous steps to sign-in to get messages and answers. Thank you VA.

<br>

> this app was working good I was able to sign in and use all the features. but the last month I can not log in with id.me or login.gov. I use either and I do the sign in and get the code numbers then it says redirecting back to va.gov app then the screen switches back and the sign in comes back. I can not sign in at all I tried uninstalling then reinstalling and even got 1 update thru play store but I still can't sign in so I will just delete it and not be able to use my healthyvet. fix this thx

<br>

> It does not work at all. It keeps switching back and forth between app and browser to authenticate, and then doesn't. Garbage.

<br>

> App forces you to log in multiple times before it allows access.

<br>

> Is clunky to use. It will not work if you have the fingerprint option now that you have to use the IDme to log in.

<br>

> cant login because how it's setup nothing is easy like it is on the website. Just use your biometrics on website so you dont remember password. deleted app instantly.

<br>


### Claims

| Feature | average rating | # of ratings |
|--|--|--|
| Claims | 4.67 | 3 |

Only 3 reviews mentioned claims not related to travel reimbursement. When claims are specifically mentioned they are usually listed as a core feature highlighted. 

Representative responses:

> Is good at tracking your claims, prescriptions, and appointment times. The downside is the app doesn't tell you what department, place, or floor your appointment is on on the app. It does on the website but not the app so for the elderly folks that barely manage to work technology as is im sure this just adds chaos to the confusion!

<br>

> Key features include easy appointment scheduling, prescription refills, and access to health records. Secure messaging enhances communication with health care providers, ensuring veterans stay informed. The app also simplifies benefit management by allowing users to check status, apply for new benefits, and manage claims. Overall, the VA app streamlines access to services, improves communication with the VA, and supports veterans in leading healthier lives, making it a vital resource for health care management.

<br>

### Letters and documents

| Feature | average rating | # of ratings |
|--|--|--|
| Letters and documents | 4.2 | 5 |

Users often note that they appreciate access to letters and documents from the app. Issues reported in this area include difficulties with uploading or sending documents and the formatting of letters as barriers to viewing from their device. Users report having to reauthenticate in the middle of a task, and getting errors blocking their ability to complete needed uploads. 

Representative responses:

> Very convenient for the keeping of award letters ..appointments and benefits..thanks

<br>

> My VA benefits, documents, medications, appointments are all easy to access and find.

<br>

> 💩 I tried to upload documents to the board of appeals several times tonight. sometimes it would take me back to the sign in page, or it would tell me that the previous action was not completed due to lack of memory. I'm so angry right now. This is frustrating 😤. so after writing this, I am going to try one more time before going to bed.

<br>

> I'm using a Motorola smartphone to access the app. Lab results and report info runs off the page and isn't resizable, thus unusable. Lab results are stated individually, not as a summary suitable for printing to share. Overall, site usability is not friendly. Please bring back myhealthevet, as before, it worked well. The MHV link in VA.gov is not helpful.

<br>

> You can check benefits, print your rating letter, look up your monthly disability payments, and send and receive messages to your VA Healthcare providers. You can also look up lab results, radiology reports and I believe you can download them to send to outside providers.

<br> 

### Profile

| Feature | average rating | # of ratings |
|--|--|--|
| Profile | 3.67 | 3 |

A few users mentioned desired improvements to the profile section of the app noting it is not intuitive to find, their status card is not up to date, or desiring a digital copy of the VA ID card.

Representative responses:

> Great app, had an issue fixed the same day. Just a suggestion put a digital copy of the VA ID card on here.

<br>

> my name is never correct in the benefit letters and while I can get to the app there is no icon on my phone that I can just select I have to search for it every time sigh

<br>

> I can't find how to file mileage for community care va approved appointments. Veteran Status card not up to date.

<br>

> 


### Payments

| Feature | average rating | # of ratings |
|--|--|--|
| Payments | 4.33 | 3 |

A few users mentioned payments specifically this month and mostly noting their ability to track their payments. One user desired a way to make a payment through the app and couldn't find it.

Representative responses:

> I use the VA for medical care and disability services.This app lets me easily contact my medical teams, track my appointments, track my payments and prove my status.It may do other things but those are my major needs.The biggest issues I have had have been unrelated to the app, like incorrectly setup appointments in person vs phone vs video. No app can fix that. This one makes it visible when that has happened though.

<br>

> trying to find how to make payments is hard

<br>

> It is a good app and very easy to use. You can't do everything with the app. The main things one would do can be started or completed in the app. You can check benefits, print your rating letter, look up your monthly disability payments, and send and receive messages to your VA Healthcare providers. You can also look up lab results, radiology reports and I believe you can download them to send to outside providers. It gets updated regularly for safety and security. Overall, I am happy with it.

<br>

### Travel Pay

| Feature | average rating | # of ratings |
|--|--|--|
| Travel Pay | 2.7 | 30 |

Travel pay functionality is desired but was noted as not working as needed. Users comment on it being hard to find, with an inability to track the status of the reimbursement, and at times an inability to complete the request. An issue impacting the travel pay API mid-August directly impacted users sentiment regarding travel pay this month.

Representative responses:

> Thank you for making it easy to file for travel reimbursement again. Ever since you discontinued the kiosk reimbursement, it has been such a pain in the …. to file, that I stopped filing. Thank you for the mobile app. Also for the pharmacy refill application.

<br>

> It doesn’t allowed my tracking of travel reimbursement which is unfortunate.

<br>

> I don't see the section for travel pay. supposed to be in the health section, don't see it.

<br>

> Love the app, also like that it shows when there is a travel claim that can be made and lets you know how long you have to file.

<br> 

> Will this be fixed? Multiple complaints on Reddit. For those looking for how to file for travel, it’s buried under Appointments then Past Appointments. Otherwise a pretty good app.

<br>

> VA sent out a letter/email to notify of easy Travel Pay Sys integrated into VA APP. Upon using there was no VA Travel Pay BTTTS tab or option. Had to select appointments and go to old travel claims under appointments to be taken to an online BTTTS option not a part of App and re-sign in. This is not streamlined easy access. This is actually more complicated than just logging online to Beneficiary Travel System. Please fix this issue. ASAP. Should only take 20 min max in my experience with IT-CSE

<br>

> Yeah, it's pretty good, except for those travel claims. Every time I try to do one, whether it's for something already scheduled or a new thing, it craps out, and I can't finish. It's not just the app, either; the VA website does it too. Everything else is awesome, though.

<br>

### Messaging

| Feature | average rating | # of ratings |
|--|--|--|
| Messaging | 4.0 | 25 |

Messaging is a well appreciated feature in the app, however common complaints include not finding needed providers on the list to send messages to and a desire to remove messaging. Users noted changes in their provider list after recent updates loosing access to the providers they previously had and need, with no known avenue to request needed providers. 

Representative responses:

> This is the easiest and best way to communicate with your primary team or specialty team.

<br> 

> Just update the app and now only Kansas City MO is showing for secure messaging. What a shame because the previous version did not have this problem

<br>

> Everything was working fine until this last update when I tried to send a message. It asked me to 'Pick A Care System' and the app won't let me scroll down to do so... Kind of a big deal since it's required. Please look into it. Galaxy Note 10+

<br>

> I love this app except you cannot move messages to trash. I touch the MOVE and the only option is to INBOX. How can we get rid of OLD OLD messages?

<br>

> since the latest update - we can not send secure messages to any office that my husband sees. There are 4 or 5 facilities listed in the drop down menu and the three facilities that he goes to are not listed.

<br>

### Prescriptions

| Feature | average rating | # of ratings |
|--|--|--|
| Prescriptions | 4.6 | 50 |

Prescriptions are rated as a strength of the app, although Veterans still request additional functionality related to prescritions, or note that the grouping and flows are unintuitive. 

Representative responses:

> Unexpectedly going through the messages, it was a one touch refill everything endeavor. I was very pleased pleasantly surprised.

<br>

> This App has been a life saver for me by making it user friendly enough to use. The information and dr appts and medication info in (real time) makes the quality of my life better because I can stay on top of my medications. Thanks for all you do for Vets. God Bless!ARMY VETERAN

<br>

> The groups that are set up are very confusing. I've tried 3 times to request a prescription to no avail...

<br>

> The new format is not intuitive for requests and checking prescriptions. I manage, so not a complaint but an observation.

<br>

> I have attempted to print a current med list and this site printed ALLthe meds I have ever used!! 

<br>

> I have found the site very useful, though I am not very happy with the new medication refill section of the site it is cumbersome and overly complicated compared to the old one.

<br>

### Appointments

| Feature | average rating | # of ratings |
|--|--|--|
| Appointments | 3.0 | 40 |

Appointments are a favorited feature by many app users who provided a positive rating for the app. Additions to appointment details would continue to add value to users, where users mentioned desiring to see the reason for the appointment, payment status, and more detailed address elements such as building names with room numbers. The mixed ratings suggest that improvements to this area are still needed and users pointed out lack of informationas the number one reason for dissatisfaction, and some mentioned the desire to make an appointment from the app.

Representative responses:

> The appointments are much easier to read and have more information.

<br>

> Looking forward to whats to come. Would like to suggest having the word "Paid" under the appt, next to "Confirmed".

<br>

> I would have given the app 5 stars, but the appointment information is lacking. There is no provider info. When you have multiple appts, you do not know who the appointment is for.

<br>

> The appointments section needs work. The medical department associated with the appointment is sometimes not shown, resulting in the need to call the VA, which in itself can be an exhausting exercise. Also always missing is any indication of lab work that may be needed before the appointment, so that should be added. Otherwise, one must go the frustrating telephone route. Maybe VA employees should be required to use the app and other such computerized tools as the BTSSS. In that way, they themselves could find the glitches and shortcomings veterans have to deal with and get them fixed. The overall information technology capability of the VA is average, at best.

<br>

> Easy to use app... only suggestion is the ability to request, change, or cancel appointments thru the app...

<br>

> UNSAT! You cannot make an appointment, but you can see all your past ones and cancel any current ones. This is a dramatic lack of oversight. Vets should be able to schedule an appointment with this app after fingerprint verification both in the app and through a website. UNSAT!

<br>

### Other enhancements
#### App support (2)
Several users mention the desire to reach someone knowledgeable about the app to assist them with a service the app provides, noting mixed success with call center agents and lack of knowledge from in-person staff at their local VA care centers. 

> initially there were quite a few technical glitches preventing me access. it took me a few tries to finally reach an agent that had the knowledge and expertise to help with the biometrics system. to this day I am appreciative of amount of help this application provides! keep up the good work 👍🏾


<br>

> You have to wait to contact a person via phone 📱 who may not be able to direct you where to go because they're not familiar with the app. not very helpful!!! maybe you can ask veterans in certain age groups with limited technical skills about how to better build it around VETERANS NEEDS, instead of a younger non-veteran developer!

<br>

#### Dependent claims (1)
One user specifically desired the ability to track statuses of claims also related to their dependents.

> It also doesn’t let me check the status of my wife’s ChampVA application which is very unfortunate and an oversight on this apps part I believe. It app is also referenced as the place to go to do these thing. 

<br>

#### Notifications and Alerts (2)
Users often rely on the app as a quick, accessible method to confirm details or take action on their benefits. Several users noted a desire to recieve more proactive communication from the app through notifications.

> Very rarely information. It also rarely pushes notifications.

<br>

> this app is one of very good things and helpfull info also alerts of refills ect. Thanks to the devs for this and making our(veterans and family) life easier.

<br>
