### Summary of overall feedback
The August 2025 feedback for the VA Health & Benefits app reveals a polarized distribution of ratings with 42% of responses giving the app a 5 star rating, while the second highest percentage of ratings at 22% rate the app as 1 star. While many users appreciate the app's convenience and ease of use for managing healthcare and benefits, a significant number report issues with login, navigation, and specific features like travel pay and messaging.

Representative responses:

> This app is so valuable. I‚Äôm thankful that it exists and impressed with its function. It‚Äôs easy to use and has so many helpful tools that make accessing VA benefits much easier. Because of this app, I‚Äôm more likely to tend to my medical needs. I can easily communicate with my doctor through the app, request medicine, refill medications or check on my other VA benefits. Very thankful to have such an awesome tool in my pocket.

<br>

> The app is both more intuitive and more reliable than the website. Well done VA techies, I appreciate your thoughtfulness and understanding. Bravo

<br>

> I have been able to communicate with providers at the VA in seconds using this app. Logging in takes under 30 seconds. I have tried for months to login through the old va.gov website and could never access provider messaging (or anything useful )where now using the app, it is not only possible but instant instantaneous and at my fingertips (iPhone)THANK-YOU!üëçüòé

<br>

> This is the best government app I have ever used. Functionality, ease of use, everything in one location. I was skeptical at first but this is the best thing the VA has done.

<br>

### Negative
| Rating | % of ratings | # of ratings |
|--|--|--|
| = 1 | 22.41% | 80 |
| = 2 | 9.24% | 33 |
Roughly 32% of the received sentiment rated in the negative, with many users reporting issues with login, navigation, and specific features like travel pay and messaging. Some users also express frustration with the app's limited functionality and the need to use the website for certain tasks.

Representative responses:

> This app is terrible it does not have the updated travel claim that is supposed have. It was the main reason for the new ‚Äúgreat‚Äù app. To top it off it‚Äôs says this update has Been online for 2weeks.

<br>

> VA is putting information out publicly about being able to make travel claims through this app. Well I‚Äôm here to tell you there is no such thing as making a travel claim on this app. VA needs to remove all such information saying this until it‚Äôs proven that it is in the app to make a travel claim.

<br>

### Neutral
| Rating | % of ratings | # of ratings |
|--|--|--|
| = 3 | 11.48% | 41 |
Roughly 11% of the sentiment received ranked as neutral, with many users acknowledging the app's potential but also pointing out areas for improvement. Some users find the app useful for certain tasks but still lacking in functionality compared to the website.

Representative responses:

> Manually added CC appointments and associated travel claims are not depicted.

<br>

> Don‚Äôt see where I can submit a travel claim. Also there is no option to anywhere to dispute an erroneous travel claim amount.

<br>

### Common themes

#### Login issues after update (50)

Many users reported login issues after a recent app update, with some being directed to a test site or receiving error messages. This caused frustration and prevented users from accessing their accounts temporarily. The mobile app platform team was able however to roll out an error message within 24hrs of the found issue which directed Veterans to update their app version to receive the fix and correctly sign-in to access their account. However the temporary direction to a staging account was a major cause of confusion and concern for Veterans attempting to access the app during this time. 

Representative responses:

> Everything was great until the recent update. Now it won‚Äôt let me log on. It just constantly pending but never does anything.

<br>

> It was really good! Downloaded the update and now I can‚Äôt sign in. I deleted the app, resigned in and then it asked if I wanted to use Face ID? Ok, then I have to re-sign in again. It goes back to the gateway error number 504 I think! Can‚Äôt use the app!

<br>

Recommendation: 

#### Travel claim submission problems (30)

Several users reported difficulties with travel claim submissions, including the inability to find the travel claim feature within the app, problems with direct deposit information, and general frustration with the process.

Representative responses:

> The latest version of the app says a travel claim can be completed within the app, but in the health section, I do not see anywhere to submit a travel claim . Is it connected to a an appointment after the appointment is complete?

<br>

> VA travel pay direct deposit is still unchangeable. The app does allow you to file a mileage claim, but there is no way to update your VA travel pay direct deposit info. It gives you a sign in error when you try to access that section and crashes and calling the number listed for the VA travel pay vendor gets you a human that sends you to the travel pay clerk at your regional VA.

<br>


### User pain points

#### Login difficulties
Many users struggle with the login process, citing issues with ID.me, two-factor authentication, and general difficulty remembering passwords. This is a major pain point, as it prevents users from accessing the app's features.

Recommendation: Simplify the login process by promoting biometric options. Login research including a temporary addition of a login issue survey for unathenticated users will allow the team to further gather data about the issues app users may be experiencing to analyize for root cause. Provide links to clear instructions and support for users experiencing login issues.

The organization of the app's menus and sections could be improved to enhance usability.

Users generally appreciate the ability to access their disability rating information through the app, finding it convenient and helpful.

Representative responses:

> Never keeps me signed in and I have 140% but only get 80% because the VA only allows people that pay lawyer's to get away with false claims allowing them a fake lifestyle. I can barley stand for a few hrs now still has to find a way to make ends meet for his new family and VA wants me to repay back pay for getting divorced in 2020 and went through mental trauma and seemed therapy from VA and that did help. VA has helped me out a lot, I'm just so mad that I have had to fight for what I am due.

The downside is the app doesn't tell you what department, place, or floor your appointment is on on the app. It does on the website but not the app so for the elderly folks that barely manage to work technology as is im sure this just adds chaos to the confusion!
