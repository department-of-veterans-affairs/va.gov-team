## Suggestions for Improvement
**(31 reviews, 17%)**

### Prescription Renewals
- I have noticed that the VA went away from requesting renewal of prescriptions easily
from the site/app. Can we get that feature for meds re-added?
- Add a way to track expired prescriptions as well.
Appointments and Scheduling
- I wish that when it notes my appointments that it would show the specialty and the
doctor that I will meet with.
- Nice app, but you tell us the date and time for our appointments but it would also be
nice if we knew what clinic the appointment is for. Can you work on that also?
- Often times appointments aren’t viewable on the app itself.
- Need to be able to SCHEDULE APPOINTMENTS instead of just viewing and
canceling. If I can cancel, I should be able to schedule.
- Can we get an actual description of what the appointment is for on this app?
- It should have a feature to view the status of our travel claims.

### Travel Claims
- Whoever needs to fix the travel BTSSS system because you can’t get in now for some
reason to claim travel pay.
- It would be great if they would add in travel claims to the appointment so that after
the appointment is complete, you could fill out the information necessary to submit
a travel claim from the app.
- Nice progress in accessing information. But this app really needs a BTSSS link for
travel claims.
- Add a feature to apply for travel claims directly from the app.
- Please streamline the authentication process so that it doesn’t log people out
randomly.
- Can you add an option to make travel pay easier to fill out?

### Messaging and Communication
- Hard to locate the access to messages unless there is one in the inbox. Very time-
consuming.
- Very easy to do. Sure beats going to the VA and waiting in line. Secure message
works great to contact your providers. Every Vet who goes to the VA should have a
MyHealthVet app on their phone.
- Secure messaging capabilities need to be improved significantly.
- Please make the messaging system within the app more accessible.

### Authentication and Login
- Changing phones had to reinstall the app. On the login page, it refuses to select the
text boxes to enter id.me credentials. Dslogin method has the same issue. I can sign
in just fine if I use the website.
- Make it easier to log in, sometimes authentication takes too long.
- Please streamline the authentication process so that it doesn’t log people out
randomly.
- Consider making the app work without constantly requiring new log-ins.

### Notifications and Alerts
- Increase the number of notifications we receive for updates regarding claims.
- We also need an alert from the app when there has been a change in stage or
document uploaded.

### Features and Functionality
- Excellent, reliable app for accessing VA prescription, appointment, payment, and
rating info. Medical records, including x-rays, Dr. and lab reports, etc., are not
currently available in this app. They can be accessed from va.gov using a web
browser. They will be added to the app sometime soon(?).
- Can you make the app display when our case has been assigned to a Regional
Office-that would be helpful in tracing case status.
- Can you add a feature to Tracey DTA-Error cases where it progresses through the
steps as well?
- The app needs widgets to make it easier for us to access features quickly.
- The app needs easier navigation options for older veterans.

### General Usability
- So far so good, but I have to say, that VA website is very vague as to the location of
this app on the store, and better, more prominent links should be provided on the
MyHealthVet page. I had to search for the link after initially installing a non-VA app.
- Can we add a way to edit the mailing address without requiring users to go to the
website?

## Negative Feedback
**(46 reviews, 26%)**
Usability and Interface
- So confusing and hard to use, almost like it was done intentionally.
- Difficult to log in and navigate.
- It is not user friendly. You have to get a code every time you want to check
messages, and then they don’t come to the phone where you can answer and get
the code.
- Overly complicated, doesn't have an index. Going to the messenger takes too many
steps.
- Not user-friendly. I preferred the other site.
- The site is now harder to understand and use. It was better before.
- Difficult to navigate.
- Very difficult to access My Health e Vet.
- Trying to get in the app and the 12 verification steps are terrible and not convenient
at all.
- The new app barely opens and you can't access half the information. Needs so
many improvements.
- I’m confused by the feature that requires a new code for each login.
- It seems to work but this app offers nothing that va.gov doesn't do.
- The VA site is not very well organized or easy to find what I need.
- APP COMPLICATED.

### Technical Issues
- The app always changes the password system, the reset screen freezes up and
forces a whole long process, if there were an option for zero stars that’s what I rate
it. Terrible app, developers should be reprimanded.
- My phone is up to date so not sure what the problem is.
- I can’t get anything open nor show me anything.
- It never has all my information. Sometime it has some information and then a few
weeks later that information is gone and other information is missing.
- Do an update so the app arranges our files according to dates like on the website.
Also, can you make the app display when our case has been assigned to a Regional
Office - that would be helpful in tracing case status. We also need an alert from the
app when there has been a change in stage or document uploaded.
- Whenever updates happen, my account information seems to be changed or
deleted.
- The app is slow, can't predict what it will do.
- I hate how every time I try to log in the app, I get sent to a gov website, log in there,
then have to verify via phone.
- The sign-in process went from two or three clicks to a cumbersome process, one
star! The whole app is clotted with mumbo jumbo that only means something to the
developers and VA employees.
- Can’t access most of My Healthy Vet stuff, constantly logs you out. You literally have
to login manually every time.
- Won't access most of Health e Vet stuff, constantly logs you out.
- The only message I keep getting is "Information not available right now."

### Messaging System
- It doesn’t do any good to have a message format if no one answers our messages!
- Message to a provider and team goes 14 days unanswered.
- I can't make contact with my Team to ask questions online via the app.
- Secure messaging didn't work. Used to work on the old app.

### Appointment and Prescription Management
- This app doesn’t tell you what or where your appointment is.
- I’ve tried several times to refill prescriptions on this “new and improved” system and
it has never worked!
- App needs more information. It only tells you what VA location your appointment is
at. It does not tell you with whom the appointment is with or where in the VA center,
it's located.
- So far my prescriptions haven’t gone through, I can’t understand how to leave
messages.
- Your new changes for medication refills have caused me to run out of my pain
medication. NOT ACCEPTABLE!!

### Missing Data and Accessibility
- Every time I use this application, half of the information or more is unavailable. It
never has all my information.
- Healthcare letters have gone missing from the app, VA tech support is of no help.
Please fix this issue.
- Unable to view labs. For 15 years we went to My Health e Vet and could see labs.
Now you can't do that now.
- Many of the links on the app lead to a message saying to call them. I find no use for
this except for viewing medical records.

### Excessive Requirements and Monitoring
- Surveillance app. It requests access to way too much information.
- The system needs to be abolished and a more effective system created.
- Wow what a great app to request information with the veteran affairs. Now I am
safer because veteran affairs won’t illegally take my gun, and arrest me for
telepathy.

### Other
- This is NOT an app it opens browsers that just sit and say opening please wait while
we open the application for you. This is not an actual app!
- This app was great then they updated it and now it is trash. Barely ever opens and
when it does you can't access half the information because of technical issues.
Same old VA. Always doing too much. Can't leave well enough alone.
- If I'm not careful, it will time me out without notice. Have to start over again. Semper
Fi.
- Can’t login.
