## **Detailed Findings**

**1. EXAMPLE: Need for repeaded login attempts posed a significant pain point for 8 out of the 17 reviews/feedback mentioning login.** Five of the users specifically mentioned login as one of the reasons why they stopped using the app.

Of the 5 Veterans who stopped using the flagship mobile app, 2 used MHV login credentials, 1 used ID.me, and 2 did not know which login credential they tried to use. As a result of these login challenges:

* 2 Veterans eventually gave up
* 1 Veteran went in person to a nearby VAMC to get help and managed to get logged in
* 1 Veteran resorted to using MyHealtheVet on their computer
* 1 Veteran deleted the app and reinstalled it a few months later

_“The last few times I tried to log in, I couldn’t. It was not working. I hit the sign-in and when it wants to know my user ID and password, that’s when I get into trouble and finally give up. - Participant 13_

_“Now, I put user ID and when I hit go, all it does is the color goes green and if I use the down arrow, this field is required comes up and the keyboard comes up but I can’t see the block to type but I type anyway. So, when I type it in and hit go it takes me back to the sign-in screen. That’s where my frustration creeps up and I just go back to my computer.” - Participant 4_

_“Sometimes after 9pm or 10pm, you can't go in the app. I did it again later and the same thing. I thought it was maintenance.” - Participant 17_
