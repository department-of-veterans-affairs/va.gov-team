# Mobile App - Q3 Review Analysis Workflow
Working Document

## Process for Quarterly Analysis
1. Extract all monthly analysis data sources into a single .txt file.
2. Average rating scores.
3. Aggregate noted themes, pain points, and feature requests summarizing across all three months and noting counts. Document by highest count first. Extract most notable quotes related to each area, grabbing across all three months utilizing the same template as the monthly analysis [link].
4. Run recommended VA Research Op Github Copilot prompts from the consolidated .txt file as the data source uploaded as a document [link]. 
5. Record Ai prompts and responses according to recommended workflow [link].
7. Compare Ai prompts to previous summarization for improvements or outliers.
8. Extract or create data visualizations from data sources to add to the powerpoint.
9. Update quarterly powerpoint template [link].
10. Draw conclusions based on comprehensive data on what is driving score results and how we might improve.
11. Summarize all findings in a 1-2 paragraph section.
12. Make recommendations on future research and app/feature improvements. 
13. Complete prioritization matrix for needed improvements.
14. Create a Q4 research roadmap that aligns with the recommendations as prioritized in the matrix.
