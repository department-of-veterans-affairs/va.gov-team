# VA Mobile App Review Analysis
Q3 App Review & Feedback

## Analysis Motivation & Approach 
**Why we conducted this review**

To gain insights into Veterans’ experiences with the VA Mobile App by analyzing App Store and Google Play reviews as well as responses to two in-app surveys, the RX Intercept Survey and the Give Feedback survey. These reviews help us identify what’s working well and uncover areas where the experience can be improved.

**What we wanted to learn**
What aspects of the app are Veterans satisfied with?
What significant pain points do Veterans experience?
What are the areas of improvement based on these reviews?

**What are we hoping to achieve?**
Identify areas of opportunities to improve Veteran experience.
Identify and prioritize friction points that may inform future iterations.

**What data did we look into?**
App Store and Google Play reviews from June-September 2025.
Google Analytics Report from June-September 2025.
Give Feedback Survey responses from June-September 2025.
RX Intercept Survey responses from June-September 2025.

### FY 25 OCTO goals supported
1. Improve satisfaction with our web and mobile products by 5 points.
2. We have reduced the total time Veterans spend waiting for a response from our digital experiences by 50%, towards a goal of less than 4 seconds per transaction.

### Methodology
1. [Affinity mapping in Figjam](https://www.figma.com/board/4UyDWmxQ0ZAiOQzkhw7UyN/Service-Design-Exploration?node-id=639-1933&p=f&t=QotowCnJsgyDwK0z-0) feedback analyzed previously during monthly anaylsis review
2. [Collaborative Ai analysis](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/research/Quarterly%20User%20Research%20/Q3/Analysis_Workflow.md) with Github Copilot verified by individual assessment and data confirmation

## Learnings from Q3 2025

### Key Findings
1. Veterans continue to review The Mobile App highly with satisfaction overall. 
- Users often share short, generalized impressions of the app in reviews with positive ratings. These sentiments most notably mentioned improved access, ease of use and convenience.

2. Sign in continues to be the most reported pain point for app users.
Sign in problems are the most frequently reported issues in mobile app reviews or surveys. Sign in loops where the user is repeatedly taken back through the sign in process are commonly reported from Android users and across a wide range of dates. Other issues include biometric failures, MFA challenges, failure to retain credentials when ‘remember me’ is active, and an overall dislike of the process.

3. Android users leave significantly more reviews in app stores compared to iOS users.
Although there were more than double iOS users (1,561,867)of the VHB app than Android users (766,342) in the 3rd quarter, the app received more than triple the number of app store reviews from Android users (1199) compared to  iOS users (303) in Q3. 

### Data Snapshot
Exhibit 1: Positive experience in Veteran ratings reflected during months July to September 2025

This chart shows the distribution of ratings collected from all four sources during the 3rd quarter. Veteran satisfaction scores skew drastically positive this quarter at 75.5% (or 4016 total).

#### Key
|Color |Rating |Percentage |Count |
|-------|------|-------|------|
| Blue | 1 | 8.2% | 331 | 
| Red | 2 | 8.3% | 332 |
| Yellow | 3 | 8.0% | 321 |
| Green | 4 | 19.5% | 784 |
| Orange | 5 | 56% | 2248 | 

*Note: Discrepancies were found in counts of user feedback from in app surveys after it was discovered that a default setting extracted representative sample data only and not comprehensive data. Those full data set counts are reflected in the totals displayed here, but not in the monthly analysis reports.

### Positive Sentiment Analysis
Over 76% of Reviews Praised the Mobile App for Ease of Use, Simplicity, and Convenience. Veterans who gave the app a positive rating (4 or 5 stars) praise the app as valuable because of its simplicity and ease of use. Noting sentiment of “delight” or “excitement” over how easy the app is to use. Some Veterans note that it improves their access and streamlines their personal healthcare management. 

The reviews from July through September 2025 shows that the following elements of the app are highly valued by Veterans.

**Usability:** This is one of the most frequently mentioned and appreciated app elements by Veterans during this quarter, making the process of managing their health easier and convenient. 


**Functionality:**  The app is frequently praised for its health features. Veterans note that it is easier to order their prescriptions through the app, communicate with their healthcare providers through messaging, and prepare for their healthcare appointments.


**Navigation:** Many reviews this quarter noted the simplicity of the navigation in the app where Veterans can easily find desired features with a short learning curve. 

#### Positive Sentiment User Quotes

<br>

> “This app has changed my life if I can't get to my doctor I can let them know what is going on with me without having to go thru hurdles I remember when my nurse a long time ago was asking me if I had this app and I'm like no that is stupid well I was wrong this app is amazing.” - Veteran

<br>

> “I was impressed! ( That's VERY unusual for a govt site!) This was my first time using it and once I tried each section, found it was straight forward.

### Negative Sentiment Analysis
Slightly over 16% of Reviews Reported Frustrations with the app – Most linked to known bugs/issues. Veterans who rated the app 3-stars or less often shared common pain points. The most significant numbers of pain points received were in the following categories: 

- **Sign in Issues:** Veterans struggle with the sign in process, citing issues with ID.me, two-factor authentication, and general difficulty remembering passwords. Other notable issues include reported looping, biometric failure, and being logged out.
- **Limited content details in appointments:** Users often report a desire for more detailed information reflected in their appointments that are needed to help them prepare, and arrive at the correct location.
- **Inability to locate travel pay:** With the newer release and marketing for the travel pay feature in the app, users reported difficulty finding it at all expecting to see it uniquely identified instead of within existing appointments.
- **Ability to message needed providers:** A change in list options made it difficult for Veterans to send messages to their desired medical team or recipients. Some users mention frustration when trying to locate the messaging area within the app altogether.

#### Negative Sentiment User Quotes

> “ID me website has a checkmark to remember me on this device. Yet it does not work. Ex. I use the app, take a break for 5 minutes, then have to repeat the whole process all over. It’s unnecessary.” - Veteran

<br>

> “All of my appointments do not tell me what my appointments are for. I see many doctors and I never can tell who I am suppose to see. I get location of appointment but that is not enough for me to discern what it’s for. Can you please fix that. Thanks.” - Veteran

<br>

> “The latest version of the app says a travel claim can be completed within the app, but in the health section, I do not see anywhere to submit a travel claim.” - Veteran

<img width="1767" height="714" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-19 at 3 44 39 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87b57c98-2167-47e2-88e3-89b4a2d331b7" />

**Total app users by operating system during Q3 2025**

Despite more app store feedback being received from Android users, iOS users make up over 66% of the VA Health & Benefits mobile app active users, whereas Android users make up about half that percentage at just over 32%. However new users during this third quarter show a closer percentage difference, with just over 57% of new users utilizing iOS and nearly 43% of new users on Android. 

### What version of the app are users on?

<img width="1767" height="430" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-19 at 1 11 35 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32d1cbd0-d18f-43af-954d-4e2c42c6f26c" />
