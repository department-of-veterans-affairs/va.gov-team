# Feature Brainstorm Summary

## Background
On May 18, 2020, Ad Hoc and DEPO team members brainstormed features that a VA mobile app could have, using questions derived from discovery research as a guide. Discovery research summary can be found here. 

## The questions developed for brainstorming were: 

**How might a mobile app...**
1. enable a Veteran to quickly do a task on the go?
2. facilitate better communication between a Veteran and VA?
3. meet a Veteran at the stage of life they are in?
4. reduce the burden on a Veteran and their family to advocate for themselves?
5. help a Veteran navigate the fractured VA experience?
6. better share all the benefits that are available to a Veteran?
7. support a Veteran in a prolonged benefit decision process?
8. facilitate more transparency for a Veteran?
9. support a Veteran who is in crisis mode?
10. save a Veteran time?

## Output
This brainstorm led to dozens of feature ideas, which in turn were sorted into **4** functional groupings of user needs that can be met by an app: 
1. Learning about how VA can help solve their problem
2. Checking in on a status, doing quick transactions
3. Continued support while working towards a solution for a longer term problem
4. Standard mobile app features we think an MVP mobile app should have

These functional groupings were prioritized in a working product roadmap that will continue to evolve as user testing and tech discovery continues.
