# Data 

### App Reviews  


***September 2024***

*   The App has great potential - However, when a User tries to manage a message, Archive or Delete - nothing is simple. Not even offered inside the Message. Kinda Clunky!  
    *Managing a message (ie. Archive, Delete) is not user friendly*

*   App works well, but only some of the VA personnel can use it for messaging and setting appointments.  
    *Not all VA personnel can use it*

*   The app is much better than I was, I still don‚Äôt receive notification when I‚Äôve been messaged but I do believe they are updating and working on the app actively  
    *Don‚Äôt get notifications for messages*

***August 2024***

*   I don‚Äôt have the option to mail all my providers .  
    *Can‚Äôt message all providers*

*   Please include what is the department is or subject. Thank you  
    *Include department or subject*

*   It‚Äôs convenient for very few things and maintains significant barriers. The attachments in messages never load, the claims information is very minimal so you have to login on a browser anyways, additionally there are a multitude of other failures as is common within myhealthevet messaging. The biggest being the absolute garbage fest that is communicating with providers (or not being allowed to communicate with them.. even if they message you because you are not seen in their ‚Äúclinic‚Äù according to myhealthevet). Additionally the names of organizations and contacts is abysmal. The effort from the latest update appears to focus on bridging the gap between a simplistic look and a more modern look so some leadership can get more big bonuses, without actually helping vet‚Äôs gain access to care anymore efficiently. The VA remains a pleasant laughing stock comparable to any modern organization and this app is the perfect showcasing of said joke.  
    *‚Äúnames of organizations and contacts is abysmal‚Äù*  
    *Can‚Äôt write to providers if MyHealtheVet says you aren‚Äôt being seen by them, even if they have written to you*

*   The app works great the only area I see needs work is the messaging function. I try to move old messages to the trash folder but can only do that on the website.  
    *Can‚Äôt move messages to trash*

*   Unable to use the Draft option in the secure mail once I've created a draft message. Otherwise, a vast improvement over the website! ü´°  
    *Can‚Äôt access draft messages*

*   it's mostly standard, compared to other apps. it's about as good as "MyChart" (U of R) or "My Care" (RGH). So, as convenient as the other two regional choices I have where I live. I know the VA is still working thru digitization, so I don't expect it to be perfect. I love that I can contact my doctors without a phone call. the app messages usually get answered within 24 hours. it would be good if there was a way to turn on phone notifications for a "new message" in app tho.  
    *Can‚Äôt get notifications for messages*

***July 2024***
(there was a bug this month related to message attachments, since that was a temporary problem I didn‚Äôt include that feedback)  

*   Hello when writing an email to a provider on the top right it has ‚Äúsave‚Äù instead of actually a ‚Äúsend‚Äù. To actually send the email you have to stop writing the email and scroll all the way down to send it. Doesn‚Äôt make any logical sense. Please fix this as it‚Äôs very confusing to say the least. As for suggestions please add the following: 1)A way to process travel reimbursements as that still has to be done on the travel website. 2)a way to download ‚Äúblue button‚Äù medical records as that also is only able to be done on the website. Thank you  
    *Expects ‚ÄúSend‚Äù to be where ‚ÄúSave‚Äù is instead of having to scroll for it*

*   This app is a time saver and it‚Äôs very good. The only thing I wish I was able to do was to be able to Courtesy copy Do another person or department. Not being able to do this at the moment, I would cut and paste information from another message to info someone else, making communication less efficient.  
    *Courtesy copy another person or department*

*   Logging in and out of this app is very inefficient. I have Face ID setting turned on, yet every time I log in, there are probably six or seven screens to navigate through just to get in, including ‚Äúwaiting to redirect‚Äù and needing to text authentication codes every time. And when you log out, there are 4 pages and prompts to get through just to leave. The messaging system needs some work too. It only shows a portion of sent messages, and when you click the down arrow to expand the window, it still won‚Äôt show you the full message. And for writing new messages, the main message box is irritating at best. Accidentally touching outside of the box makes the text go gray, and the screen jump up and down. The cursor is like a sick joke being played on me, and most of the ‚Äúcontinue‚Äù buttons need to be pressed at least two or three times to activate. I downloaded the app because it‚Äôs supposed to be simpler than using the website, but that doesn‚Äôt seem to be the reality. And considering that a lot of us veterans are suffering from PTSD and high anxiety, I would hope that the developers could create an app that doesn‚Äôt give me a near panic attack every time I need to use it. Do better, please.  
    *Can only see part of sent messages*  
    *If you accidentally touch outside of the text box when writing a message, the UI jumps and text goes gray*¬†

*   Messaging between veterans and the different departments in the VA has always been difficult, seeing that veterans need an appointment before messaging can open up to a certain department, and in addition, messaging is not a highlighted feature of this app or in any place, where you have to go searching for messages first on the VA page. To enhance this for veterans, please make a separate ‚ÄúMessages‚Äù button on the main screen that veterans can click on to get into their message inboxes. Then you should create a way for a veteran to click on the VA system (Denver or Cheyenne) that they are messaging, the department inside the selected VA, and then the doctor or staff member you want to. If the veteran doesn‚Äôt know what person, there should be a way to send a message to a general mailbox, which could be forwarded to the person in the department, and then this contact be saved so that the veteran can connect directly to them the next time they come on. It would also be a great feature for veterans to go to sick-call using the video option, instead of driving all the way down to the VA and waiting inside. There should be a doctor designated for video sick-calls and a nurse/scheduler on call. I also hope that there can someday be a doctor on call for video appointments during after hours and on the weekends. It seems that driving to the ER for having the flu is not something the staff at the ER appreciate getting, as they always push non-urgent patients out the door to see their regular doctors a few days later. Please see that our veterans get the care that they need and deserve.  
    *Have to search to find the messages function*  

*   It is hard to message different departments because you need an appointment first, should be able to select any system, department, then provider  
    *Should be a general mailbox that routes mail to the correct person*  

*   Unable to delete, move, archive old messages to prevent a cluttered window. No separation between messages for different clinics 7/25/2024  
    *Wants to be able to Delete, Move, and/or Archive old messages to prevent clutter*  
    *Wants messages from different clinics to be separated*

*   it's not sending my messages and only saving them as drafts. I thought the point was to be able to communicate with my doctors?  
    *Messages are saving as drafts instead of sending*  

***June 2024***

*   I loved this app. It made contacting my physicians, getting refills, and monitoring my appointments so easy. It was a convenient one-stop shop for all things VA. But, as usual, we can‚Äôt keep anything nice. Those of us using certain facilities were unceremoniously bumped off this app with no warning because our facilities switched over to a new software system. Now it is impossible to use this app to contact my physicians, get refills, or monitor my appointments. The new website is a pain to reach and log in and is sometimes offline. VA, you had done something right when you created this app. Please figure out how to make it work for those of us who got kicked off.  
    *The ‚Äúnew software system‚Äù at my facility means that I can‚Äôt message my doctor*

*   Works great, not many gripes. Very convenient to have access to letters from the VA in the palm of your hand. If they could expand the access to give you a way to communicate with your primary and other care providers, I'd give it 5 stars. Not sure if it's realistic, but sure would be nice.  
    *Wish I could communicate with my PCP and providers in the app*

*   I thought the update would correct the problem with being able to send the message. At least it will be saved in draft mode. But will have to send it by the laptop.  
    *I can‚Äôt send messages, I can only save drafts*

*   Not easy to use and cannot direct message my specialty doctor.  
    *Hard to use*  
    *Want to be able to message my specialist*

***May 2024***

*   I tried to send an sms to my provider multiple times via website, but it kept saying send failed. So, I copied msg and tried pasting it to the app to send. It created huge gaps between hard returns + other formatting glitches, as well as bouncing back to the end of the msg many times as I tried to re-edit the message‚Äôs formatting errors  
    *I get ‚Äúbounced‚Äù to the end of the message while trying to edit it*

*   Good app in terms of getting around VA certain features without using web version. Add feature of not having to fill drafts before you can save them. Sometimes I have to jump back and forward reading something between my email client and drafting VA message to provider. It would be nice if I didn't have to fill everything just to save it as draft. For sending out? Sure title is needed, but for draft?  
    *I don‚Äôt want to have to fill out everything in order to save a draft*

*   It says one new message when you check it you sign in there's no new messages you sign out still says one new message. You need to restart phone to clear it. Fingerprint log in has worked one time. Tried,several things no help.  
    *I get notified of a new message when there are no new messages, have to restart the phone to clear it*

*   Good App. can message pac team and other specialty clinics and refill prescriptions. only drawback is cannot figure out how to add a certain specialty clinc. have to go to the main hospital office and have them do it. I like how you can download the blue ribbon report and see all doctors notes. sometimes the app is under maintenance and you cannot access it. which it forces you to re login. biometrics needs to be more consistent. I get frustrated having to keep logging in sometimes because this  
    *Can‚Äôt figure out how to add a specialty clinic, have to have the ‚Äúmain hospital office‚Äù do it*

***April 2024***

*   This app is convenient for some things. It has several glitching issues and boots you while working on typing messages and deletes the messages when you hit send and will log off on its own without warning. If you need to write a message that is longer than a couple of sentences, then use myhealthva.gov instead. That at least saves a draft rather than deleting it all and having to go back and rewrite it.  
    *I get logged out while replying to messages and then the when I hit send the message is deleted, at least MyHealtheVet saves a draft*

*   This app is very unreliable. I never get alerts about messages being sent to me, and when I see that a claim letter is available when I click on Claim Letters, it says none are available. I have to call the VA and have an agent read them to me or wait 12 days to get the letter in the snail mail. 9 times out of 10 I get the "the VA mobile app isn't working right now, try again later" message. Unusable.  
    *I don‚Äôt get alerts when I receive a message*

*   can't delete messages any longer. What happened??  
    *Why can‚Äôt we delete old messages anymore?*

*   how to trash old messages  
    *I want to be able to delete old messages*

*   The app doesn‚Äôt show the entire message after you reply. My nurse wrote of an ointment I should get. I replied to her then when I went to look at the message, the app cuts it off so I cannot see what the ointment is. Why are the messages in the app being cut short? Why can‚Äôt I read the entire message?  
    *I can‚Äôt see full previous messages after I reply in a message thread*

***March 2024***

*   Just typed a whole bunch of stuff and pressed something and lost it all. Not doing it again  
    *Pressed something and lost everything I had typed*

*   ITS THE VA, WHAT DO YOU THINK? STOP REMOVING PROVIDERS FROM THE MESSAGING AND WHY HAVE SO MANY THAT WE DONT USE?  
    *Don‚Äôt remove providers from messaging*  
    *Why are there so many providers that we don‚Äôt use*

*   I like the app, but when I try to use secure messaging it does not let me reply. I have to go to the website signing in all over again to be able to send a message or to reply.  
    *Am not able to reply to messages*

*   Request you fix app. The messages sent and received in the VA app Healthcare section, messages Are out of chronological order. The messages are listed in an inconsistent order, causing confusion and dysfunction. Especially when trying to communicate with various VA providers. Request you fix messages so they are in a consistent chronological order.  
    *Messages are not listed in chronological order*

***February 2024***

*   Creating messages is terrible. I usually use a seperate app to craft messages, and then I paste my messages in to the dialogue box. For the amount of money the American People pay the VA, these apps should not be plagued with basic coding errors.  
*I compose messages elsewhere and then paste because the creating messages experience is terrible*

*   I've been cut off completely from my providers. Whenever I want to send a message, it continues to say "you can longer communicate with triage, message failed".  
    *Getting error message "you can longer communicate with triage, message failed" when I try to send a message*

*   Would like to have more options as to messaging specialty clinics or other entitles. At the moment my Primary Care physician asked me to message them for more information. How would I be able to do that when I don‚Äôt have them on my drop down list of contacts. In addition, it would be nice to have some kind of portal to communicate between local hospitals and the local VA.  
    *PCP isn‚Äôt in my contact list, want to have the option to message more people*

*   I like the app but there needs to be a button so you can delete secure messages.  
    *Want to be able to delete messages*

*   It would be nice if the keyboard didn't cover the message block so I could see what I'm writing.  
    *Keyboard covers message and I can‚Äôt see what I‚Äôm writing*

***January 2024***

*   Other than having to log in again after using my fingerprint to unlock the app the newest versions of this are quite good. You even get notifications of your messages. I just wish when you clicked on the message it actually took you to the message itself, as the web page is poorly formatted. Great dark theme. Dropping one star as I still have to log in after using my fingerprint to unlock the app. Will drop again if not fixed in the next update.  
    *Wish that the message notification took you directly to the message not the webpage*

*   This site is most helpful. I am older and there has been difficulty trying to complete the tasks I have to do. It seems that when I am typing a secured message to anyone I get the message almost complete and for some reason the message just disappears. Can you please let me know what the heck‚Äôs going on? It is soooo frustrating. Please keep in mind those of us that are older. Babsbluvd  
    *The message disappears while I‚Äôm composing it*

*   Not working, not seeing my providers in the messages area, constantly logging me out, what‚Äôs the point in having this app if it is not benefiting me?  
    *Don‚Äôt see my providers*

*   I was referred to the community care program for my thyroid. After 1 appointment at a local provider I was told I cannot see the local provider, I have to go to Green Bay. This is an hour drive each way. I have not heard from the provider since doing the labs he ordered which show my levels are very low. My medication is almost out and I do not have the response needed to get the correct prescription. I am not able to send a message directly to the Green Bay Endocrinologist. I do not feel I am getting the care I need to manage a life long medical issue I have.  
    *Can‚Äôt send a message directly to the provider that I need to contact*

  
# Research Studies

***Notes from Personalized Homepage Research study***

*   Expecting reply from doc: I get alerts when a message comes in and that's when I go to the app. I have them sent to my email -- something like "You have a secure message" When I downloaded my app, I make sure I know how to use it and set the settings.

*   Prompt re: "4 unread": That's good! That means there are some messages I need to pay attention to so I'm going to go investigate. I do a lot of telehealth -- I probably never checked on the message because I don't know where the unread ones are. All of these I've read.I want a filter to unread messages
    
*   Observer note: She couldn't find her unread messages easily, said a filter would be useful, (scrolling through 134 pages of messages to find the unread messages). Missed buttons at top of screen in Rx & Messages (looked at bottom).

    *In the Personalized Homepage Research study Veteran participants set up alerts so they get emails notifiying them of a new message. They would like to filter by unread messages, otherwise they have to look through pages and pages of messages to find the unread ones. An Observer noted that the Veterans looked at the bottom of the screen instead of the top for buttons*


***Findings from Mobile App Retention study***

*   Pain Point: Veterans at Cerner transition facilities: messages and upcoming appointments no longer visible directly in the app

*   Key Finding 4: Veterans prioritized communicating with their doctors, and finding out about benefits they‚Äôre eligible for
    
    *In the Mobile App Retention study Veteran participants said communicating with their doctors is high priority*

    *In the Mobile App Retention study Veteran participants said it was a pain point that Veterans at Cerner facilities can‚Äôt message in the app*

  
***Findings from VA: Health and Benefits Information Architecture Research: Open Card Sort Findings***

*   Key Finding 8: Secure messaging was not grouped into one clear category
  
    Labels: Contact the VA, secure messaging
    
    Brief description: Participants did not have one clear category where they put Secure Messaging. Interestingly, most participants grouped Secure Messaging with the services they use it for. Since three participants use secure messaging to schedule appointments, they categorized it with appointments. One participant uses it to order prescriptions, so they put it with prescriptions. Two participants grouped it in a category they identified as ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù indicating that this is an item unique to them.

    Supporting data: "I use secure messaging with both prescriptions and appointments\[...\]I guess it could go in both or either." When prompted to choose one, he put it in prescriptions since he uses it more with that. [P10]

    *In the IA & Nav Open card sort the group that the Veteran participants placed the messages card in varied because they grouped it with the service that they used it for*


***Findings from VA Mobile App - IA & Navigation: Evaluative Research - Usability Study***

*   Pain Point: Didn‚Äôt notice Messages feature: 4 participants mentioned that they didn‚Äôt notice Messages (wasn‚Äôt included as a study task, but identified by participants as important to them).

*   Recommendations: Consider a potential higher placement for messages within the app‚Äôs hierarchy.
    
    *In the IA & Nav Eval. research study: ~‚Öì of Veteran participants didn‚Äôt notice messages. A recommendation was made to consider a higher place in the app hierarchy. (This was before the implementation of the home screen)*


# Tickets with ‚Äúuser feedback‚Äù label


***Explore the possibility of a "funnel" for secure messaging #9444***  

During the BVA / Section 508 monthly meeting on August 21, 2024, there was discussion around how to make secure messaging a bit easier to use for screen reader users and for users with cognitive disabilities. During the session, a Veteran brought up a few issues that she has been having with the picker list for providers recently (tickets already created for those) and mentioned that she has over 25 providers to choose from. Other Veterans on the call also mentioned having a large number of providers and how difficult it can be to find who they are looking for in the list. This began a discussion around the possibility of working towards a "funnel system" when creating a new message.

In a perfect world, the first input would be to select your facility, then select the department (since providers could have similar names or a Veteran may not know the name of the person they are looking for), etc. As each selection is made, the names in the provider list would begin to narrow down and only show providers in the selected facility and then the selected department. This could leave a Veteran with a much smaller list to choose from when it comes to their providers.  

*Would like a ‚Äúfunnel‚Äù to choose providers because the list is very long*

***Alternate ways to add a provider, etc. in picker lists #9440***

In the BVA / Section 508 monthly meeting on August 21, 2024, one of the participants talked about her current experience with selecting a provider, category, etc. when sending a new secure message. This participant has roughly 25 providers with VA and is a screenreader user. To select a provider, she has to activate the picker list, then swipe through the list of providers, tap to select the provider, then swipe all the way back up to "done", the tap that to actually select and input the provider into the field. She asked if it would be possible to have the provider selected when she taps the name initially vs. being forced to navigate all the way back to "done".  

I do not think the solution is as simple as just removing the "done" link and could be worth exploring other options. Other participants on the call asked if there was a way to narrow the picker list down by letter, some asked if we offered a way to search for a provider name, etc. I would recommend spending some time to see if there is a way that we could make the picker lists (especially for providers) simpler, faster, and easier to use for screenreader users.  

*Make the picker lists simpler, faster, and easier to use for screen reader users. Consider not having to select ‚Äúdone‚Äù, being able to search for providers, or ‚Äúnarrow the picker list down by letter‚Äù*
