# **Research Plan for VA Mobile App Information Architecture Research: Open Card Sort - October 2021**

This work falls within the first phase of a three-phase Mobile IA & Navigation project that will contribute to the [Redesign of the VA Mobile app](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/features/design/redesign-initiative-brief.md). It is the first  of a three part of IA research study. For a summary of the entire project, see [VA Mobile App: Information Architecture & Navigation - High Level Summary](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-design/information-architecture-navigation/High%20Level%20Project%20Summary.md).


## Background

The VA Mobile App team needs a better understanding of how Veterans would navigate benefits and health services within the mobile app. We want to ensure the structure and organization of the app makes sense and can accommodate the new features we have identified as of interest on our roadmap.

### OCTO-DE Objectives

The following are the [OCTO-DE objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme) that this research supports.



1. Increase the usage and throughput of VA services
2. Decrease the time Veterans spend waiting for an outcome
3. Increase the quality and reliability of VA services


### OCTO-DE Goals

The following are the [OCTO-DE ](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme)goals that this research supports.



1. Veterans can manage their health services online
2. Logged-in users can easily track applications, claims, or appeals online
3. Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features


### Veteran Journey



* Primary point in the Veteran journey: “Taking care of myself”
* Secondary points: “Reinventing myself, “Putting down roots,” and “Retiring”


## Research Goals



* To understand Veterans mental models for VA health and benefits services and how they would logically group them so we can tailor an information architecture that supports those mental models.
* To understand how Veterans would group items that are on our road map but not yet in the App to future proof the Information Architecture.
* To understand where Veterans would expect to find vaccine records in an app within the current information architecture.


### Outcome

We know there are additional health and benefits services not currently in the app that Veterans have requested. This research will allow us to adjust the information architecture in the app to accommodate future features before we scale the app to a larger audience. This is important as it will allow us to easily add those future features without having to make Veterans learn new navigation paths as the app grows. 


### Research questions

To understand mental models of health and benefits services:



* How do participants categorize items?
* Why do they pick the categories for items?

To test current information architecture as it relates to vaccines:



* Where do Veterans expect to find vaccine records?
* Why did they choose the path they did?


### Hypothesis

Veterans will categorize items in a similar manner to how they are organized on VA.gov. In the current app information architecture Veterans will look for vaccine records under health care and have no issues finding it. 


## Method



* Moderated open card sort exercise in Optimal Workshop. 
* Followed by a qualitative interview, using a prototype in Balsamiq (moderator driven).


### Location

We will be running our study remote via Zoom.

## Recruitment


### Recruitment approach

We will be recruiting Veterans using the Perigean contract..


### Recruitment criteria

Recruit for 12 sessions (8 fulfilled sessions).


#### Primary criteria (must-haves)



* Participants must be able to join our Zoom call via computer or as a tablet or mobile device screen would be too small.
* We will not be able to accommodate non-sighted users due to the technology. 
* No assistive device users (low-fi prototype does not support assistive technology)


#### Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)

Participant pool should be diverse in:



* **A majority should be My HealtheVet users**
* **Gender (30% or more women)**
* **Age (ideally two people each from 18-30, 31-50, 50-64, 65+, but can be flexible)**
* **Density (rural)**
* Branch of service
* Geography
* Race
* Diversity of experience with VA benefits and services, but ideally all participants with experience in the following 2 areas:
    * Disability benefits
    * Health care benefits
* If possible, Veterans should not be VA employees
