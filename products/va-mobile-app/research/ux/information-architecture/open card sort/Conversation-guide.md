## Intro - 5 minutes

When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro:

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about VA services and then do an activity.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:



* This entire session should take about 1 hour]. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
* In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veterans’ needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
* If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.
* Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete the analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
    * If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

Start recording.



* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?


## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 10 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.



1. Where are you located?
2. What branch of the military did you serve?
3. How frequently do you use VA.gov?
4. Which VA benefits do you use?
5. Can you tell me about a time when you used the VA website to complete a task?


## First Task: Card sort- 30 minutes



* (Share your screen) Can you see my screen? Before having you open the activity yourself, I am going to show it to you and walk you through the goal of the activity. Feel free to stop me if you have any questions.
* This is a tool that helps us understand how Veterans would group certain items. If we can understand how items are grouped, we can then organize them in an expected way in the app. It is kind of like this, imagine you own a grocery store and you have a truck delivering a shipment of new products and you need to figure out the best place for everything in the store so that shoppers can easily find it. You might consider putting the cheddar cheese with other dairy products and a broom near the cleaning supplies. 
* On the left, we have various cards with features and tools you might recognize from VA services you have interacted with. On the right you can drag items and group them together. If you do not recognize what something is on one of the cards, or need me to explain it a bit more, let me know.
* Instructions to open the card sort:
    * Go to the chat in zoom. It is located at the bottom of this zoom window and looks like a speech bubble.
    * Click on the link for the optimal workshop card sort. 
* Step 1: Organize cards in a way that makes sense to you
    * We will start at the top left and work our way through the cards, while we are moving them, help me out by “thinking out loud” so that I can understand why you might want to group things together.
* Step 2: Label the groups you made at the top of each group. 
    * Now we are going to look at each group and label them in a way that makes sense to you. 
* Step 3: 
* If the clusters are over 6 cards.  --> “Now let's take a look at some of these big groups and see if we can break them up a bit more.” 
* If the clusters are under 3 cards.  --> “Now let's take a look at some of these smaller groups and see if we can merge them.”   \

* Step 4: Important cards
    * Look at each group, pick 2 cards that are most important to you and tell me why. 
    * Now, if you had to pick 3 cards that are most important to you, which would you choose?
    * As you completed this activity, did you notice anything that is missing that you use through the VA?


### Things to watch for:



* Does the participant understand the meaning of all the cards?
* Does the participant have an unexpected reason for why they are grouping certain items the way they are?


## Second Task: Prototype Walkthrough - 5 minutes



* Instructions to open the prototype:
    * Go to the chat in zoom. It is located at the bottom of this zoom window and looks like a speech bubble.
    * Click on the link.
    * This is a prototype, so it will not be fully functioning but we will use it to see how you go about completing a task. First I am going to give you a scenario and then I am going to give you a task for you to complete. As you navigate through, please think out loud, tell me what you see, where you think you want to click, what is confusing, or frustrating. 
1. Scenario : You can’t remember if you got your flu shot and you think you might be due. You want to look at your immunization record and find the date of your last flu shot. 
    1. Task 1: Use this prototype to click through and find the date of your last flu vaccine. 


### Things to watch for:



* Does the participant hesitate, click on the wrong button, get confused?


## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes



* Question 1:  Is there anything else I should know?
* Question 2: 
* Any questions for me?
