# Research Goals

The purpose of this work is to inform the information architecture, content and design of the VA Mobile app in order to deliver a solution that is usable, useful, and extensible. See [VA Mobile App: Information Architecture & Navigation - High Level Summary](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-design/information-architecture-navigation/High%20Level%20Project%20Summary.md) for a high level summary of the entire 3-phase process.

Our **goal** in this study **(**Phase I - IA Research - Pt 2 - Closed Card Sort**) is to:
* **understand how users think about the current and possible future content** in the VA mobile app 
* **confirm what the high-level information architecture categories** should be in the VA mobile app


# Research Questions



How do veterans think about the current and proposed pieces of content on the VA Mobile app?



1. How do Veterans think about the current and proposed pieces of content on the VA Mobile app?
    1. Do Veterans understand the proposed categories? 
    2. Are there any cards that Veterans felt uncertain about what category to place them in?
    3. Are there any categories missing?
2. Does previous experience with specific services or tools within the VA (such as mobile app use) affect user mental models?
 
    



# Methodology 


Using Optimal Workshop, we conducted an unmoderated study in which participants were invited by email to participate. After accepting the invitation, participants received a link to a card sort activity that contained a list of about 35 pieces of current & proposed content from the VA mobile app. Each participant sorted the content cards into one of several fixed categories (i.e., Health, Benefits, etc). They were also be able to add new categories if they felt that a card didn't fit into the provided categories.

* The [cards for this study](closed-card-sort-categories-and-card-list.md#card-list-for-closed-card-sort) are (with a couple exceptions) the same cards that were included in the [Open Card Sort](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/research/ux/information-architecture/2021-10-open%20card%20sort/Card-Sort-Research-Plan.md), but with reworked descriptions for clarity).
* The [categories for this study](closed-card-sort-categories-and-card-list.md#categories-for-closed-card-sort) were based on the [findings from the Open Card Sort](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/research/ux/information-architecture/2021-10-open%20card%20sort/Card-sort-research-report.md), a review of the current VA.gov website structure, and conversations with teams on the VA.gov side about future IA efforts).


# Hypotheses and Conclusions

Categories provided, and how we expected participants to sort cards: 

| **Health** | **Benefits** | **Payments** | **Account** | **General VA Info** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| COVID-19 updates & information | claim status | disability compensation | biometric sign on setting | Contact the VA |
| vaccine records | VA letters and documents (called benefit letters on va.gov) | education payments | notification settings | Find a VA location |
| list of medical appointments | GI bill balance (also called education benefits) | view direct deposit payment history | disability rating | privacy policy |
| secure messaging | transfer GI bill dependents | manage direct deposit | military information |  |
| Make a doctor appointment |  | pay your health care copay | personal and contact information |  |
| prescription refill request |  | payback your overpayments | manage dependents |  |
| schedule an immunization appointment |  | pension payments | sign out |  |
| patient check-in |  | travel expense reimbursement | share this app |  |
| health record |  |  | Veteran ID card |  |
| join a video appointment |  |  |  |  |
| labs and tests |  |  |  |  |
| list of prescriptions |  |  |  |  |



1. **Veterans will be able to categorize cards presented in the card sort using the groups provided.**
True

2. **Veterans will categorize cards in a similar manner to how they are organized on VA.gov.** 
Yes and no. In terms of categorizing cards similarly, participants grouped cards according to the new categories we created (Benefits, General VA Info) to represent a combination of several VA.gov subcategories (ex: participants sorted cards that correspond with the VA.gov “Disability claims”, “Education and training” and “Records” categories into the new mobile “Benefits” category), with few exceptions. They also filed cards that matched existing categories on VA.gov (Health, Account) into those categories. \
In terms of categorizing cards differently from VA.gov, participants filed cards currently found in many sections on VA.gov under the new Payments category (more on that below). Participants mostly did _not_ create additional categories to correspond with the exact categories on VA.gov. 

3. **Veterans will find the proposed Payments category intuitive & categorize all payment related cards there.** 
True. Overall, participants sorted payment-related cards into the new “Payments” category (7 out of 8 cards sorted into Payments had “high” or “very high” agreement). 

4. **Veterans will categorize cards representing common mobile app actions in a way that’s consistent with other apps in the wild (ex: Account, Settings)**
Yes and no. Veterans sorted cards having to do with their personal information into Account and cards related to the app’s settings into Account or General VA Info (Some apps in the wild include both personal info and app settings info in a single Account or Profile  category, others have a dedicated Settings category).


# Key Findings

* **Overall, participants grouped the cards provided in similar ways, and they included the same core groups of cards within the provided categories (Health, Benefits, Payments, Account, General VA Info).**. In a small subset of cards, there was greater variation around category placement. 
* **Overall, the categories participants created were in line with what we predicted** (more detail in the full findings). 
* **Participants overwhelmingly agreed on which categories to place the majority of cards**, with 20 out of 36 cards having very high agreement (33 had “high” agreement or greater). That said, **more than half of participants (25) reported that they felt uncertain** about where to place one or more cards.
* **Only a few participants created new categories** The only category created by more than one person was Education (3).
* **The new Payments category performed well.** Despite the fact that a consolidated category does not yet exist on VA.gov, the majority of participants sorted payment-related cards into the new Payments category.
* **Previous use of the VA Mobile app seemed to affect the way participants sorted cards** (19 participants who reported that they were VA Mobile App users grouped the cards in similar ways, whereas participants who reported that they were not VA Mobile App users grouped the cards in a variety of different ways).


# Detailed findings (research questions—answered)


### How do Veterans think about the current and proposed pieces of content on the VA Mobile app?



* Participants agreed on which categories to place the majority of cards, with 33 out of 36 cards having at least “high” agreement in a single category among participants (20 had “very high” agreement)
    * A few cards had lower agreement among participants (fewer than 60% sorted them into the same category):
        * Education reimbursements from the VA (58% in Payments, 26% in Benefits, 8% in Account, 6% in Education)
        * COVID-19 updates & information (54% in General VA Info, 39% in Health, 2% in Account, 2% in Benefits, 1% N/S)
        * VA letters and documents (nearly even split of 43% in Benefits & 48% in Account, 4% in General VA info, 4% in VA letters & documents
* However, categories created by participants varied & there was some overlap between categories.
    * Health was the strongest category, with most participants agreeing on the exact contents.
    * The new Payments category had fair agreement among participants
    * Cards within Payments, Account, Benefits, and General VA Info had high or very agreement.
        * Participants sorted 33 different cards into Account, 22 different cards into General VA Info and  20 different cards into Benefits).
        * There was also **overlap** in the cards sorted into the Benefits, Account & Payments categories. 
    * Some participants also expressed uncertainty about these categories in our questionnaire.
* **Categories created by participants mostly aligned with what we expected** (differences from our hypothesis highlighted in bold, cards with multiple placements indicated in italic):

| **Health** | **Benefits** | **Payments** | **Account** | **General VA Info** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *COVID-19 updates & information*       | claim status                | disability compensation             | ~~disability rating~~            | contact the VA                 |
| vaccine records                      | *VA letters and documents*    | education payments                  | Veteran ID card                  | find a VA location             |
| make a doctor appointment            | GI bill balance             | view direct deposit payment history | military information             | privacy policy                 |

| secure messaging                     | **disability rating**           | pay your health care copay          | ~~manage dependents~~                | ***COVID-19 updates & information*** |
| prescription refill request          | **manage dependents**           | pay back your overpayments          | biometric sign on setting        | *sign out*                       |
| schedule an immunization appointment |                             | pension payments                    | notification settings            |                                |
| patient check-in                     |                             | travel expense reimbursement        | *sign out*                         |                                |
| health record                        |                             |                                     | *share this app*                   |                                |
| join a video appointment             |                             |                                     | *VA letters and documents*         |                                |
| labs and tests                       |                             |                                     |                                  |                                |
| list of prescriptions                |                             |                                     |                                  |                                |



* 4 cards (disability rating, manage dependents, COVID updates & info and share this app) were sorted by a majority of participants into a different category than we anticipated.
* 5 cards had stronger agreement in one category, but also had secondary category with over 30% agreement  (manage dependents, manage direct deposit, COVID 19 updates & info, share the app, sign out of the app)
* 1 card (VA letters & documents) was sorted evenly between two categories \



### Do Veterans understand the proposed categories? 

Yes. Nearly all participants (42 of 45) reported that they understood the proposed categories


### Are there any cards that Veterans felt uncertain about what category to place them in?
Yes. More than half of participants (25) reported that they felt uncertain about where to place one or more cards (21 participants said they did not):
* 7 participants mentioned uncertainty around Benefits
    * "Benefits, because almost everything fit somewhere else…” P7
    * “I felt uncertain about finding balance for benefits.” P6
* 7 participants mentioned Payments
    * “Payments to and from; documents, etc. establishing veteran status…” P14
* 6 participants mentioned a need for subcategories
    * “...excessive number of cards in health and benefits without the ability to subcategorize…” P14
    * “I would want separate benefits tabs… one for education benefits and one for disability benefits” P23
* 2 participants mentioned Account
    * “Anything with "MY" or my family status should be accessible in My personal account” P#1


### Are there any categories missing?

Mostly no. Only a few participants created new categories

* 5 out of 45 participants created new categories
* The most common new category created was Education (3).
* Other categories created: This App (1), VA Letters & Documents (1), Other (1), Computer/Cloud Documents (1) \



### Does previous experience with the VA mobile app affect veteran mental models as they relate to the VA Mobile app?

Yes, previous use of the VA Mobile app seemed to affect the way participants sorted cards.

* 19 participants who reported that they were VA Mobile App users grouped the cards in similar ways. 78% of participants agreed on the cards within Health, Benefits & Account. 60% of participants agreed on the cards within General VA Info, Payments
* 27 participants who reported that they were not VA Mobile app users, grouped the cards in a variety of different ways. 78% of participants agreed on the cards within Health, and General VA Info. 60% of participants agreed on the cards within Account, Benefits, Payments 13 cards had lower (&lt;50%) agreement.

# Recommendations

Overall, participants grouped cards in similar ways—the categories they created contained the same core groups of cards. In a small subset of cards, there was greater variation around category placement. Because these core groups were strong, we recommend moving forward rather than following up with another card sort.


### We recommend the following changes to the high level IA to improve clarity between categories and better match participants’ mental models:

**Health**

* Keep category name & contents as proposed.
* Explore adding subcategories in tree test taxonomy.

**Payments**

* Keep category name (could also consider an alternate label, ‘Money?’ if Payments doesn’t feel inclusive enough of both payments and debts); keep other content as proposed.
* Move ‘Manage direct deposit’ into this category.

**Benefits**

* Keep the category name, explore adding subcategories (Education and training, Disability claims and appeals) in taxonomy to address extensibility (allowing the app to grow in terms of benefit-related feature set).
* Move ‘disability rating’ and ‘manage dependents’ into this category.

<del>Account</del> **Profile**

* Because it was a ‘catchall’ category for some participants, we recommend returning to “Profile” to better distinguish from Benefits category (“Account” label may be too general), explore adding subcategories in tree test taxonomy.
* Move ‘VA letters & documents’ into this category

<del>General VA Info</del> **N/A**

* Because it was a ‘catchall’ category for some participants, we recommend that we consider renaming this category or \
dropping it altogether and having items live on Home (as they do currently).
* Consider moving ‘Share this app’ into this category.

### Other Recommendations



* As of 3/16/22, ‘COVID-19 updates’ isn’t on the VA.gov home page (but is still accessible via search, and vaccine information is included in the Health section)—we recommend following their lead in terms of whether or not to include it on the homescreen.
* Based on the difference in mental model between mobile vs non-mobile user, we recommend considering onboarding or cross-references for some cards to address the gap.
* Consider testing the findability of items in the current VA Mobile app’s IA using TreeJack to set a benchmark before testing the findability of items in the proposed IA.
