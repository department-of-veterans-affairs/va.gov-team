# Research Plan for VA Mobile App Information Architecture Research: Closed Card Sort

This work falls within the first phase of a three-phase Mobile IA & Navigation project that will contribute to the [Redesign of the VA Mobile app](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/features/design/redesign-initiative-brief.md). It is the second of a two part of IA research study, and was preceded by an [Open Card Sort](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/va-mobile-app/research/ux/information-architecture/2021-10-open%20card%20sort). For a summary of the entire project, see [VA Mobile App Information Architecture & Navigation - High Level Summary](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-design/information-architecture-navigation/High%20Level%20Project%20Summary.md).


## Background

The VA Mobile app was designed to allow Veterans to more easily complete key transactions across VA Health and Benefits services. 

As the app grows in its feature set, the VA Mobile App team needs a better understanding of how Veterans would navigate benefits and health services within the mobile app. We want to ensure the structure and organization of the app makes sense and can accommodate the new features we have identified as being of interest on our roadmap. Because the mobile app is not the only way that veterans interact with the VA, we also want to ensure that we're considering that larger system of digital and analog touchpoints when we think about our approach to how Veterans find information and features within the app.

### Project Objectives & Goals 


#### OCTO-DE Objectives

The following are the [OCTO-DE objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme) that this research supports.


1. Increase the usage and throughput of VA services
2. Decrease the time Veterans spend waiting for an outcome
3. Increase the quality and reliability of VA services


#### OCTO-DE Goals

The following are the [OCTO-DE goals](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme) that this research supports.


1. Veterans can manage their health services online
2. Logged-in users can easily track applications, claims, or appeals online
3. Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features


#### Veteran Journey


* Primary point in the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf): “Taking care of myself”
* Secondary points: “Reinventing myself, “Putting down roots,” and “Retiring”


### Previous User Research

* An [Open Card sort study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/research/ux/information-architecture/2021-10-open%20card%20sort/Card-Sort-Research-Plan.md) was conducted in October 2021.  The cards in the open sort represented current app functionality + planned/proposed app functionality. Their selection was based on conversations with stakeholders.



## Research Goals


### Information Architecture Research

Fulfills [issue #2552](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app/issues/2552)

The purpose of this work is to inform the information architecture, content and design of the VA Mobile app in order to deliver a solution that is usable, useful, and extensible. See [VA Mobile App: Information Architecture & Navigation - High Level Summary](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-design/information-architecture-navigation/High%20Level%20Project%20Summary.md) for a high level summary of the entire 3-phase process.

Our **goal** in this study **(**Phase I - IA Research - Pt 2 - Closed Card Sort**) is to:
* **understand how users think about the current and possible future content** in the VA mobile app 
* **confirm what the high-level information architecture categories** should be in the VA mobile app


### Outcome

This research will allow us to adjust the information architecture (and navigation model) in the app to accommodate future features before we scale the app to a larger audience. This is important as it will allow us to easily add those future features without having to make Veterans learn new navigation paths as the app grows.


### Research Questions



1. How do veterans think about the current and proposed pieces of content on the VA Mobile app?
    1. Do veterans understand the proposed categories?
    2. Are there any cards that veterans felt uncertain about what category to place them in? 
    3. Are there any categories missing?
2. Does previous exerience with specific services or tools within the VA (such as mobile app use) affect user mental models?


### Hypotheses 


1. Veterans will be able to categorize cards presented in the card sort using the groups provided.
2. Veterans will categorize cards and name groups in a similar manner to how they are organized on VA.gov.
3. Veterans will find the proposed Payments category intuitive & categorize all payment related cards there.
4. Veterans will categorize cards representing common mobile app actions in a way that’s consistent with other apps in the wild (ex: Account, Settings)



## Methods + Tools


### Closed Card Sort (remote, unmoderated)


#### What it is

*In a closed card sort, participants are asked to sort topics from content within your website into predefined categories. A closed card sort works best when you are working with a predefined set of categories, and you want to learn how users sort content items into each category. [Usability.gov - Card Sorting](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/card-sorting.html)*

[Card Sorting - Methods 18F](https://methods.18f.gov/validate/card-sorting/)


#### Method

Using Optimal Workshop, we would like to conduct an unmoderated study in which participants are invited by email to participate. After accepting the invitation, participants will receive a link to a card sort activity that contains a list of about 35 pieces of current & proposed content from the VA mobile app. Each participant sorts the content cards into one of several fixed categories (i.e., Health, Benefits, etc). They will also be able to add new categories if they feel that a card doesn't fit into the provided categories.

We would like to get complete sorting responses from **at least 30 Veterans**, in distinct cohorts of fewer than 10 participants per cohort (per PRA). Each cohort will access the study using a unique URL.

* The [cards for this study](closed-card-sort-categories-and-card-list.md#card-list-for-closed-card-sort) are (with a couple exceptions) the same cards that were included in the [Open Card Sort](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/research/ux/information-architecture/2021-10-open%20card%20sort/), but with reworked descriptions for clarity).
* The [categories for this study](closed-card-sort-categories-and-card-list.md#card-list-for-closed-card-sort) were based on the [findings from the Open Card Sort](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/research/ux/information-architecture/2021-10-open%20card%20sort/Card-sort-research-report.md), a review of the current VA.gov website structure, and conversations with teams on the VA.gov side about future IA efforts).

### Coordination with Perigean

To assess potential participants' experiences with VA benefits or services, please use their answers to the Digital Service at VA User Research Participant Recruiting Screener Questionnaire question _Which VA benefits or services do you have any experience with?"_.

We will provide an [email template](closed-card-sort-outreach-email.md) and a unique card sort activity link for Perigean to use when reaching out to each cohort of potential participants.

We will include a required field at the beginning of the card sort to collect a code from each participant. We expect Perigean to generate and provide a unique code to each participant for tracking completion and compensation. In order to minimize abandonment, please make very clear to participants that they need to use this code when they start the card sort.

We estimate it will take participants 15 minutes or less to complete the card sort.


## Closed Card Sort Protocol

#### OptimalWorkshop.com Test

* **Welcome**
    *Welcome to this online activity, and thank you for agreeing to participate!
    * The activity shouldn't take longer than 10 to 15 minutes to complete.
    * Your response will help us to organize the content in the VA mobile app. Find out how on the next page
   
* **Pre-Study intro**
    * Before we begin... Today we’re going to ask you to think about VA benefits and services.

* **Pre-Study Question**
    * First, please enter the unique code provided to you by Perigean during the recruitment process.

* **Instructions**
    * Take a look at the list of cards on the left.
    * We'd like you to **sort those cards into groups** that make sense to you:
     * **Use the groups provided**, or
     * If a card doesn't fit the provided groups, **create your own groups** by dragging and dropping a card from the left into the empty space on the right (and then give it a name of your own).
    * If there are any cards you find confusing, make note of them.
    * There is no right or wrong answer. Just do what comes naturally. When you're done click "Finished" at the top right.

* **Thank You**
    * You’re all done!  Thanks again for your participation. Your feedback is incredibly useful in helping to determine how our content should be organized, so we can make the VA mobile app easier to use.

* **Questionnaire**
    * Were there any categories that you didn’t understand? Yes/No
        * If Yes:Checkbox Options: Health, Benefits, Payments, Account, General VA Info, None
        * If no
    * Were there any cards where you felt uncertain about what category to place them in? 
    * Have you used the VA mobile app?
    * You may now  close this window.
