# Introduction

Thank you for taking the time to talk with us today! My name is [name].

**Remote** :[Before we begin, I want to make sure that you&#39;re comfortable with there being a few of my teammates assisting me on this call including a note taker and an accessibility specialist, [name], should we need any help with technology during our session.]

**Hybrid/Person** :[Before we begin, I want to make sure that you&#39;re comfortable with there being a few of my teammates observing remotely via zoom doing notetaking]

I can share with you a little more about who we are and what we&#39;re doing before we go any further. We are the VA Flagship Mobile App team. The goal of the MVP mobile app is to enable Veterans who are already engaged with VA to quickly complete transactions within health care and benefits, like checking the status of a claim or sending a Secure Message. Today, we want to learn how we can improve the app for Veterans who have low vision and/or blindness using accessibility tools on your mobile devices.

We have [launched our app recently.] Our goal in speaking with you today is to check if those tools that you use within your mobile phone are working well and you are able to navigate without any difficulties around the app. Currently, All of our app&#39;s features are behind a sign in, but even if you don&#39;t use VA benefits or health care, we are still excited to speak with you to test the app and your experience with it even if you are not enrolled in certain VA benefits.

I want to give you an idea of what this [interview/call] will be like:

- The entire session should take between an hour and a half and two hours. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic. Feel free to let me know if you need a break at any time.
- I&#39;m going to ask you to share your screen with me, and sign in using your username and password. When you are signed into the app, it will display your Appointment, Secure Messaging, Claims and Appeal, and VA.gov Profile information if you have it. I will ask you to navigate to different sections of the app to ensure data you may have in these areas is loading as expected. For example I will ask you to do things like confirm that your personal information (like date of birth) or things like Secure Messages are being pulled from their databases correctly.
  - **Remote** _: [Are you comfortable sharing your screen with your personal information such as (birth date, address, health info) on it today with us on this call?]_
  - **Hybrid:** [Are you comfortable displaying your personal information (such as _birth date, address, health info)_ to the individuals in the room (and remotely) ?]
- Throughout the session, I may ask you about your thoughts and opinions about the pages or features but there are no right or wrong answers. We&#39;re not testing you. So, I welcome your honest and candid feedback but if at any time you don&#39;t feel comfortable answering a question, we can simply move on to the next question.
- **Remote:** In this session, I&#39;ll be having you share your Zoom screen so that I can follow along and we&#39;ll help you through that.
- Finally, this session will be recorded to ensure that I capture your opinions accurately. We would like to record today, so that if we should see an error in data, we can show that to engineers on our team who are not on this call today. We would store these recordings in a private folder accessible only by our team members, and delete it once we complete our testing study in a few weeks. Are you comfortable if I record the screen, audio, and transcripts?
