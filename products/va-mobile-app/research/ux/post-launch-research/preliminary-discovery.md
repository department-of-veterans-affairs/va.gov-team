# UAT Testing Structure

## TYPE OF TESTING

### Track A: Unmoderated Testing Method

Unmoderated remote usability testing occurs remotely without a moderator. It would offer quick user testing results to be used for further analysis. Test participants are asked to complete tasks in their own environment using their own devices and without a moderator present, which leads to the product being used naturally. The veterans are first asked a set of questions about their experience with a product and then questioned after they work in their own environments in a later period. We would set users up with the app and then ask for about 30 minutes of their time testing and then 1 hour of interviewing them. Note this method is unrecorded during their own time and we will be gaining the information via interview which would be recorded.

**Advantages**

- Since there is no observation, the likelihood of participants&#39; behaviors will not be affected. This could allow absolute honesty.
- There is no time constraint for the participants and would be beneficial from an accessibility standpoint.
- No recording and no PII concerns.

**Disadvantages**

- Tech issues or access could happen. Instructions may be interpreted differently from participants&#39; perspective. This would be a concern for our blind testers in scenarios where they cannot download the mobile app due to inaccessibility from the app store.
- Potential for high dropout rate.
- The participants would have higher chance of recall

### Track B: Moderated Testing Method (remote or in person)

This would be focusing on guiding them through the process of the app and seeing what works and what does not work. This may interfere with the screen reader which the interviewer observes and then they can ask a series of questions that relate to the particular feature. Advantages of this study in high level would be listening to the voiceover while watching them navigate through the app undisturbed using screen readers however the disadvantage of this method is that the veteran has no ability to hide their PII. The work around would be not sharing the screen and using audio based interviews.

**Advantages:**

- Allows accessibility specialists to help support the user should there be unrelated tech issues during the study that may cause folks to drop out in Track A.
- Allows the moderator to follow up in real-time to ask why a user decided to take certain actions. Recency improves accuracy as the user won&#39;t have to recall completed tasks

**Disadvantages:**

- Moderators can influence how participants behave due to the hawthorne effect. Depending on the quality of the moderator and techniques used, participant behavior could significantly change. For example, asking participants to think aloud can result in participants being more conscious of smaller details on the page compared to an unmoderated environment.

### Instruction Prior to Testing

## TECHNOLOGY CRITERIA AND INSTRUCTIONS

_Following old UAT strategy shared with Perigeon_

- All participants must be using accessible technology to be interviewed, whether it is using voiceover/Talk back, captioning, screen inversion, zoom or text size display.
- Due to the nature of their disability, see their comfort level using the app store/google within their mobile phone. If they are proficient then we would need to factor extra time to install.

# Testing with Vision Disability (low vision and full blindness)

## VOICEOVER/TALKBACK USERS

ZOOM/VoiceOver and Talkback is the free, built-in screen reader available on all Apple and Android mobile products. The technology provides speech, output, and screen magnification for the blind or low vision user, and refreshable Braille displays can also be connected via Bluetooth. VoiceOver is easily customizable by the user, and one has access to many features and functions that can be turned on or off, such as sound alerts and verbosity settings. Please note that most blind users use Apple&#39;s voiceover due to its already established and closed operating system.

Android is a vast market of a variety of phone offerings. Its talkback option is not often available to the blind user, instead offered by the phone provider&#39;s operating system. For example, Samsung provides a &quot;voice assistant&quot; continually updated 6+ months after Google&#39;s operating system updates; this often causes a glitch in bug if they don&#39;t catch them in time.

### Checklist

- Notifications off
- Use headphones (prevents SR from echoing back to participant)
-

### Tips during facilitation

- **Wear headphone** s to prevent the user&#39;s screen reader from echoing back to them (this can be very distracting).
- If you can&#39;t keep up with the screen reader, ask them to explain what their screen reader announced post-task. You can also request for the user to slow down the screen reader&#39;s rate of speed, but that may bias the study (most screen reader users are used to listening at a high rate of speed).
- Ask how they accomplish tasks. Screen reader users can navigate from heading to heading, get a list of links organized alphabetically, use the tab key to navigate to links and form controls, and search within the page for keywords, among other methods. It may not be immediately obvious or visible, so it&#39;s ok to ask for clarification.
- For mobile facilitation, send links through email or text instead of Zoom&#39;s built in chat feature. They are easier to access through notifications.
- Mirror their language. If they refer to themselves as blind, follow suit. If they do not identify as blind (e.g. this may be sensitive to Veterans with acquired disabilities), do not call them blind.
- Don&#39;t use visual cues such as &quot;click here,&quot; or &quot;Look for the blue button.&quot;
- Don&#39;t interrupt them while they complete tasks, as interrupted blind users will take longer to return to the task at hand.

### Tech difficulties/troubleshooting

- **Screen not displaying** : Toggle off screen curtains/ screen hiding tech
- **Audio not connecting:** Check to see if headphones, hearing aids or other technologies are running? Ask if they would be willing to turn off and use audio speaking out loud. If they do not want to then ask them to share their thoughts out loud verbally.
- **Screen reader announcing too fast** : Ask them to repeat or ask them to share their thoughts out loud verbally.

## BRAILLE READERS USERS

For veterans with deafblindness and veterans with hearing loss (who may not use a screen reader), braille may be their preferred AT. Braille displays are dependent on screen readers, so an user who uses Braille will have a screen reader running although they may not be listening to it. Likelihood of someone learning braille as an adult is lower than someone learning to use a screen reader. However we should be prepared in case the user took the time to add this tool to their day to day essentials.

### Checklist

- Notifications off
- Use headphones (prevents SR from echoing back to participant)
- Ensure the braille is connected and able to read the app

### Tips during facilitation

- **Using Conference technologies very minimally.** Zoom still does not have the capability to work well with braille displays as well as distracting the blind user in features( like chat that will announce via screen reader.)
- **Don&#39;t interrupt them** while they complete tasks, as interrupted blind users will take longer to return to the task at hand . Allow as much time needed to complete each step. A veteran who learned Braille later in life may not read as quickly as a blind person who has known Braille since childhood.
- **For mobile facilitation,**** send links through email or text** instead of Zoom&#39;s built in chat feature. They are easier to access through notifications. Provide instructions by text if it is unmoderated testing through their preferred communication preference which could be through email, text, or chat.
- **Wear headphones** to prevent the user&#39;s screen reader from echoing back to them (this can be very distracting).
- If you can&#39;t keep up with the screen reader, **ask them to explain what their screen reader announced post-task**. You can also request for the user to slow down the screen reader&#39;s rate of speed, but that may bias the study (most screen reader users are used to listening at a high rate of speed).

DYNAMIC TEXT/DISPLAY TEXT USERS

Dynamic Type (large text) allows users to change the default font size used across the mobile operating system. It is predominantly a tool to support low vision users, but in practice, many iOS users prefer a smaller / larger reading size for various reasons. The setting can be turned on from the Settings app:

- (iOS) Display &amp; Brightness -\&gt; Text Size or from General -\&gt; Accessibility -\&gt; Larger Text.
  - If the current setting is used, only seven font sizes are available to select, whereas Accessibility Sizes switch, which allows the user to choose from an additional five larger font sizes.
- (Android)

Note that Apps from the App Store do not automatically support Dynamic Type (unlike on Android) without some additional developer effort.

### Checklist

- Notifications off

### Tips during facilitation

- **Don&#39;t interrupt them** while they complete tasks, as interrupted low vision users will take longer to return to the task at hand. Allow as much time needed to complete each step.

Provide instructions by text if it is unmoderated testing through their preferred communication preference which could be through email, text, or chat.

- **Use visual cues minimally** but be willing to explain it in detail instead of as &quot;click here,&quot; or &quot;Look for the blue button.&quot;

## ZOOM/ MAGNIFICATION

Zoom and magnification is an accessibility tool that lets you enlarge the content you see on your device. Choices of either full‑screen magnification or picture‑in‑picture view show the magnified area in a separate window while the rest of your screen stays the same. Zoom also works with VoiceOver on iOS, so users can better see and hear what&#39;s happening on your screen. Magnification on an android can....

# Testing with Deaf and Hard of hearing \_ WIP

## Hearing aids, captions, and transcriptions users

A veteran who uses hearing aids is not entirely deaf. They may have hearing loss ranging from mild to severe. Hearing aids will pick up all sounds in a room which can be distracting to deaf or hard of hearing (HOH) veterans.

Tinnitus, which is the experience of ringing or other noises in one or both of your ears, may occur due to audio feedback. Tinnitus is often associated with hearing loss, and people may use hearing aids to assist in reducing its effects.

Hearing aids may be able to connect via phone or computer using Bluetooth. As a result, anticipate occasional disconnects due to situations beyond the participant&#39;s control. Be patient as they fix it as it can be an embarrassing experience.

## Setting up captions on zoom WIP

1. Tip: You should have access to the zoom business account and have otter.ai to be able to use this feature.
2. Sign in to the Zoom web portal
3. In the navigation panel, click Account Management then [Account Settings](https://zoom.us/account/setting).
4. Click the Meeting tab.
5. Verify that Closed Caption is enabled.
6. If the setting is disabled, click the toggle to enable it. If a verification dialog displays, click Turn On to verify the change.
7. Select the check boxes to enable these features:
8. Enable live transcription service to show transcript on the side panel in-meeting

## Tips during facilitation:

- Turn on closed captions before the Veteran enters the call.
- Share materials in advance. Sharing documents, images, or links that you&#39;ll use in the study will help folks prepare ahead of time. It can also reduce the burden on people using live transcription services who otherwise have to read something for the first time while also reading the meeting transcript.
- Use the chat sparingly. Depending on the video call software, sending a message through chat can interrupt meetings with sounds or pop ups that appear on top of closed captions. Consider using the chat function only for sharing links or other critical information for the meeting and keeping side conversations or comments to Slack.
- Be patient if asked to repeat yourself. The veteran may become uncomfortable if you are not.
- Use a headset and speak directly into a mic to prevent an echo. Consider installing Krisp or turning on before the interview so they can hear you better.
- Consider your tone. DO NOT SHOUT or overcompensate your own voice. Focus on speaking clearly, not with intensity. If a Veteran asks for you to repeat yourself, it&#39;s usually because they can hear you, but they can&#39;t understand you. Shouting interferes with the clarity of your speech.
- Don&#39;t interrupt them. If the participant is using live transcription services, interjections, affirmations, and &quot;hmms&quot; can make it difficult for them to follow the transcript. Remember that captions can have 1-2 second lag periods.
- Avoid acronyms. Acronyms are common in our work, but they can be a barrier to understanding for people who are not familiar with VA terminology. Additionally, automated transcription services often struggle with correctly picking up acronyms. When possible, spell out acronyms.
