# Research Goals
Establish foundational knowledge of Veterans' mobile app experience while using assistive technology.
Identify pain points for Veterans using assistive tech navigating the app.
Validate veteran's preferred mobile OS assistive technology using whatever tools they use like keyboard navigation and voiceover changes
Understand how different app experience expectations might differ on mobile .

# Research Questions
* Can Veterans with low to no vision who use assistive technology (keyboard, voice, and zoom/magnifier) successfully navigate the mobile app?
* Does the app have room for improvement with these tools and other tools that we may not consider during testing? For instance, would landscape mode be better to assist with a zoom magnifier? 
* Is the content language inclusive enough and not misleading?
* If the app is having login issues( or other issues), what would the veterans workaround be?
* Does the mobile app need to change or evolve to offer equitable experiences, if so how?

**Feature specific:
	* Can the veteran use claims uploads using the tools?
	* Can the veteran access their letters?
	* Can the Veteran find an upcoming appointment? 
		* Can they cancel their appointment
	* Can the Veteran find their Secure Messages?
		* Can they find where to compose a message?
		* Can they add a photo or document when composing a message?
		* Would secure messaging be easier for the veteran to use instead of calling?



# Introduction
In the scenario that we decide on an in-person and hybrid model, we have questions best answered in person with individuals who work at the [Blind Rehabilitation Center at Hines hospital.](https://www.hines.va.gov/services/blindrehab.asp) The reasoning behind this has many determining factors, such as the current pandemic and internet connectivity, etc. In our vision, two dominant testing strategies are coming out of discovery.
* The **Hybrid model** would have 2+ people on-site and 1+ sign in via computer, which would benefit “zoom magnifier” and a braille keyboard. We foresee less delay with setup and interruption that comes with screen readers. Zoom magnifier would work outside of the remote testing environment. 
* The ** Remote model** is 100% remote and sensitive to the pandemic and vulnerable populations (that cannot be vaccinated). Additionally, recognizing people triggers that may come with becoming newly disabled.



# Inquiries that need further clarification
* Based on the current pandemic situation and rules around the masking up and social distancing, we wonder about Conference rooms and their maximum capacity?
	* We think we need a private conference room to conduct any on-site testing so that we are not asking folks who use screen readers to read aloud PII in a public setting. 
	* We think we would have about 5-6 people in a room: 2-3 researchers, 1 participant, potentially someone with the participant if anyone is present with them, and potentially someone from Hines.  

* How do we  coordinate with the front desk to reserve time and schedule people? Are there specific rules around this too?
	* We want to make sure we are coordinating with people ahead of time, and not asking anyone to test the app as part of a scheduled health visit.  

* Do we foresee any issues logging on the wifi/internet for us to conduct the testing?
	* Security issues that could come up during testing, in the scenario of using a personal phone for hotspot connection?
	* We would like to have a set up with all access document to wifi to prevent having to use personal phone for hotspot

* What type of Technology tools does the center assist the veterans training?

* There was a mention of VIST coordinators; what capacity do they have to help us with this testing? 

* Does the blind rehabilitation center have employees on staff that could help us navigate any troubleshooting that may occur during testing? 
	* We think finding someone more experienced and hands-off than someone who overcompensates may thwart the testing. 
	* In scenarios where we cannot have a hospital employee to help us, how can we see about having Angela come on to help us with the hybrid testing remotely?
* What is the budget to add doc cameras for testing in person? 
	* We think it would benefit the researchers to see from the perspective of the user testing the app. Currently, zoom chat does not allow that interaction during testing. This potentially can skew testing results, so if researchers can see this firsthand, we can determine any blockers and refine any decisions regarding the app at later dates. This would be beneficial for zoom magnifier and braille keyboard accessibility tools. This also would minimize the number of people physically in a conference room.
* We are interested in testing various ranges of skill levels using accessibility tools. Would this be an option for us? Tools of interest are the following: 
	* using a braille keyboard, 
	* screen reader, 
	* and zoom text.

* When would be an ideal period to test with veterans? 
	* July is filling up with folk's PTO and Digital Foundry's offshoring. Is this similar to the blind rehabilitation center with blackout dates? Additionally, it should give us more time to recruit and more cushion room for the launch.

* Meli may have an accessibility barrier due to her physical limitations with masks being implemented in medical situations. Do we also consider having a sign language interpreter? As Otter is not successful during captioning screen readers and accents (such as Meli's). Is this something that the VA can provide?

* We will approach the testing by asking usability questions to learn the veteran's behavior around navigating the app using accessibility tools. We choose this over task-based testing because we want to learn from their workflow navigating the app and ask more open-end questions to get more feedback for future refinements.

* We were given a suggestion of creating a training service for the VA to use the app but from sound of this may not be feasible as we are trying to gain understanding of the users using the app and this may not be in scope of the mobile app contract.




# Next Steps
We think the next step is to connect with individuals on the ground at Hines Hospital Blind Rehabilitation to answer our questions and potentially scope the place to see if the in-person/hybrid model is feasible. We had a 508 Meeting call on June 16, 2021, and spoke with Claudia Balwin of Blinded Veterans Association, and she referred Martha Wilkes to a contact within the VA ( Niki Sandlan ). Therefore we will start initiating the connection with them to see about meeting staff at Hines hospital. Once we meet with individuals working at the hospital, we should have a better testing trajectory come the end of July.
