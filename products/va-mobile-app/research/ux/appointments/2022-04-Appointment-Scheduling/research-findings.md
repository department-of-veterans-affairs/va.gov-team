### Research goals

This study helped us understand the Veteran user’s perspective and experience making medical appointments. We know that Veterans have many ways to get a healthcare appointment. It can be in person, over the phone, in a secure message or using tools on VA.gov or MHV. 

We want to find ways to reflect  a similar experience in the VA Mobile App. One goal was to discover the Veteran’s mental models surrounding their current appointment scheduling experience. We also assessed the Appointment Request flow usability. We investigated if users understand appointment statuses and how to cancel previous requests in the mobile context. We also gathered feedback on how they interpret the information.


#### Assumptions

In the Request Appointment flow: Veterans are entering a time / date / appt type / 3 times. They don’t know what they are requesting, or how long it will take to receive a confirmed appointment. At the end of the study, we will need to set expectations for what’s next after the request is submitted.

##### Prompts



1. First, you need to make an Optometry appointment request for July 11 2022 in the morning. Once the request is complete, can you find it in the list?
2. Next, you need to confirm the date and time information for any upcoming appointments.
3. Finally, you need to cancel an appointment request. Once the appointment request is canceled, can you find it in the list?


##### Wrap up



* Thank you for your time.
* With everything covered today, do you have any more thoughts to share around improving the appointments experience with the VA?
* Anything else in general you want to share about your experience?


#### Methodology

This was a remote study using Zoom with each session lasting for an hour. For the first half, we conducted a semi-structured discovery interview about medical appointments. Next, we showed them a prototype of the app’s appointment experience and asked them to go through the prompts. 

Participants validated the array of touchpoints that we know they can use to schedule medical appointments. They expressed some of the preferred ways and why they work well for them. We heard positive impressions for secure messaging in MyHealtheVet, calling the office and in person. They also shared some frustrations with using the main phone number for their facility. They also noted risks for calling, including whether they will reach the right office with the number listed, and uncertainty for when they would get a response. 


### Key findings



1. Participants were comfortable with the existing ways they scheduled appointments, especially secure messaging in MHV.
2. Almost all participants (7/8) had positive comments on appointment status label tags.
3. All participants noticed the Pending label tag right away. Half of the participants (4/8) misunderstood the meaning.
4. Some participants (5/8) accurately predicted they would experience the flow before pressing Request an appointment 
5. Most participants (6/8) successfully completed the Request appointment flow in the prototype. It was easy to use, but it was unclear why they would use the tool. 


### Details of findings


#### Participants were comfortable with the existing paths to schedule appointments, especially secure messaging in MHV.

Most participants mentioned secure messaging as the most expedient way to request an appointment and get a timely response. The secondary path was to schedule it in person at a facility. Some mentioned they do this at the end of a current appointment (when they check out), and one participant said they will drive to the facility to make a request in person. These participants reported these experiences from the context of having an existing relationship with a provider. 


###### "The best way is direct messaging through My HealtheVet, they usually get back to you the same day.”


#### Almost all participants (7/8) had positive comments on appointment status label tags.

The participants seemed to appreciate these label tags because they spelled out what action they should take for the appointment, if any. One participant expressed a desire to filter or sort the list based on these statuses. Another commented that they would like to filter out or remove the appointments with Canceled tags. 


#### All participants noticed the Pending label tag right away. Half of the participants (4/8) misunderstood the meaning.

Half of the participants expressed confusion with the Pending label. Based on the definition of the word Pending, they concluded that it either meant to wait for the VA to take the next step, or it could mean the VA was waiting for them to take action. The other half that understood the label’s meaning were familiar with appointment requests. They had experience with requesting, so they knew the steps that had to occur to confirm the appointment. Most participants expected the request would be resolved within 48-72 hours, since secure messaging has a similar turnaround.


###### "Pending. That's my next appointment or hasn’t been confirmed yet. Is [the app] waiting for it to happen, it could mean a lot.”


#### Most participants (5/8) predicted to experience a way to enter appointment details when Request Appointment is pressed. 

The specific details expected ranged from “view and select VA locations” to “selecting a date and time for an appointment”. The other participants were unsure what would come next, some ideas were that it would trigger another action like a phone call or placed in a Queue for something. One participant did not see Request Appointment pinned at the bottom, they only saw it when guided. Another participant expressed that they had used a similar tool in the past, but received no response. When prompted, we discovered they were referring to the VA online scheduling (VAOS) tool.


#### Most participants experienced dissonance with the date and time selection screen

When entering date and time options for the request, we noticed some friction between the dates the participants were entering and the expectation for next steps in the process. Most assumed they were selecting dates for their appointment – and they were sure to get one of those days. Reviewing data and understanding facility/clinic business processes revealed that they are unable to fill the request with a user’s provided date. Since appointment scheduling is managed at the facility level, there can be an array of conditions that affect a Veteran’s request. Participants also expressed they could need to edit their date and time preferences in case they had a scheduling change. 


###### "I just want to know the [next] available date. I don’t want to waste time.”


###### "You are providing 3 dates, and the Veteran has no say in appointment times. If they choose one, how will the Veteran specify the time? Can they [rank] the choices?”


#### Canceling an appointment request

Many participants easily located the Cancel button on the appointment detail view. Some noted pain points, including having to reschedule a canceled request. One participant had the desire to select a specific date to cancel, and not the entire request. Another noted that they would be careful to cancel any requests after hearing from Veteran friends that canceling can negatively affect claims cases or any existing relationships with providers. 


###### "Maybe it should have a note there saying why it was canceled or telling you to request another appointment. Dees that make any sense? Because if it is canceled, I want to know why it was canceled. If I canceled it, it should say, canceled by me. Or canceled by the provider. And say ‘rescheduled’. “


### Additional insights


#### Racial disparities

This study equally represented participants across race and gender. As part of understanding each individual’s impressions when dealing with healthcare-related tasks, 3 veterans describe a negative experience with the VA. Of these participants, these 3 identified as Black women. This can represent a pattern of racial and gender disparities within the VA. We ask that other researchers continue to consider this data when conducting future studies. This data also tracks to other healthcare-related research studies concerning race, gender and intersectionality biases.


### Recommendations


#### Near term: Consider ways to streamline the Appointment Request workflow

After the study’s conclusion, we concluded that Veterans would find specific date-time selection misleading. Since they were requesting specific dates, they assumed they were selecting a final date for the appointment. We also  conducted more discovery around date and time selection within the Appointment Request, to understand the business implications. 

Originally, we thought to generalize the date-time preference to a more typical data point, like only selecting the weekday. We assumed if we provided an affordance – only weekday selection – then that would signal the appointment request was not final. 

After working with the Office of Connected Care (OCC) and VA Online Scheduling (VAOS), we understood the specificity of the date-time selection. It is connected to congressional legislation to measure the time that it takes for an appointment request to become confirmed status. This information led to another iteration of the design to include a calendar to add context a date picker could not provide. Additionally, these partners recommended releasing the Request Appointment feature with Direct Scheduling feature to provide clear distinction.


#### Near term: Consider providing all appointment statuses in the list for clarity

The Pending status badge is easily scannable, and clearly calls out a difference in the appointment alongside other varying statuses (pre-research statuses: Pending, Canceled). With appointments interspersed, we want to provide Veterans with a clear understanding of the other appointments in the list.




#### Near term: Consider including appointment modality as icons in the list

This was referenced in a 2022 MHV + VAOS study where they tested appointment modality by providing the information on the list of upcoming appointments. It is a way to determine whether an appointment is in person, over the phone, or over VA Video Connect. Surfacing this information is valuable to Veterans so that they can prepare for their upcoming appointment. This helps them to know how they are expected to join and where the appointment will take place. 


#### Future: look for places to provide Secure Messaging

Many participants noted this as a consistent and efficient way to get medical appointments, or just interact with their medical provider. Looking at this throughout the app’s features, we will consider areas where it makes sense to incorporate it within the experience.


### Next steps

As a team, we are investigating calendar implementation that ensures optimal accessibility. Since this study focused on Appointment Requests, we will uncover implications for releasing Direct Schedule screens as part of the entire experience within the app. We will also incorporate continuous discovery with all teams who work on related Veteran touchpoints.


### Further research needed

We were unable to recruit Veterans who use Assistive Tech devices, so we would recommend a follow-up study focusing on this particular demographic. We also may recommend to follow up with date-time usability and sensemaking.
