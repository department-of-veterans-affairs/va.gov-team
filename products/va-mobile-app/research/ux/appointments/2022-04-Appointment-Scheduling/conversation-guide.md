# Conversation Guide: Appointment Request Usability


## Research Goals

1. Discover the Veteran’s mental models surrounding their current appointment scheduling experience. Find opportunities, pain points.
2. Assess the usability of appointment statuses and the ability to cancel previous requests. Gather feedback on how they interpret the information.


### Assumptions

**Request appointment flow**: Veterans are entering a time / date / appt type / 3 times. They don’t know what they are requesting, or how long it will take. Set expectations for what to get at the end of the process.


## Method

Moderated study consisting of a mix of validation and discovery tasks. Ask what device they intend to use, and which tool they normally use. How proficient or comfortable are you with using the device? Is it your primary device? Recruit some with color blindness?


## Introduction

Thanks for joining the session! My name is Lauren and I am excited you are here. I have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we’re going to discuss your general thoughts around medical appointments and take a look at the Appointments feature within the VA Mobile App.

* Before we start, a few things I want to mention. **This entire session should take about an hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
* **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability.** We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran’s needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express. We welcome all of your feedback.
* **We are going to be talking about your experience with VA healthcare. Please don’t feel pressured to share any personal information.** Since we are discussing appointment logistics, feel free to leave out any specifics of your particular health care plan. **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
* **Are you comfortable if I record the session? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.**
* **If yes:** Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more. **[Start recording]**
* **I have started recording**. I’d like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?


## Warm up

- What VA services do you use?
	- *If they don’t mention healthcare. Have you ever used VA to manage your healthcare? What services?*
- How do you typically access it? Website, phone call, something else?
- What apps on your phone do you use the most, if any? Do you have the VA mobile app? (generic on purpose)
- For you, what stands out as a meaningful experience that you’ve had at the VA?
- Anything else you’d like to share? 


### Task 1: Current appointment experience discovery interview. Conversational.

Thank you for providing that information. It helps me understand your experience across a range of products. Now I want to ask you some questions about your overall experience with scheduling apppointments. 

**Overview**

- Tell me about your experience with scheduling any type of appointment. 
	* What things are more important to you? 
	* What things are less important to you?
- Do you schedule appointments online, over the phone, in person or a combination?
	* What are some pain points about that experience?
- How frequently do you make healthcare appointments?

**Upcoming appointments**

- How far in advance do you schedule your appointments? Why?
- What are some actions you take leading up to an appointment? 
- Have you ever requested an appointment where you had to select different time slots? 
- How do you keep track of your upcoming appointments?

**After an appointment**

- What are some actions you take after an appointment has occured?
- If you could change one thing about the last experience, what would it be?
- (skip if only discussed VA) With everything mentioned, do you manage your VA appointments the same way?
	- If different, tell me more about this.

**Things to watch: How the participant uses digital services to manage appointments. General actions they expect to occur after making an appointment.**


### Task 2: Appointment Request usability test. Prototype.

Thank you for your insight. Now, we're going to take a look at a few things in a design prototype of a mobile app. If you have the link, feel free to navigate to it and share your screen. If you don’t have it, no worries. I can share my screen and navigate wherever you tell me to go.  

[Link to prototype](https://www.sketch.com/s/a755a2f8-0d0d-456e-8327-61a5d31b0a97/a/52jgk4w/play)

Let's navigate to the list of Appointments. Before we select anything, let's just take a look at this. Feel free to scroll up and down, but stay on this list. 
- What stands out to you first when looking at the landing screen?
        - Tell me more, or why is that?
- What information do you notice when scanning this list of appointments?
- Do you notice anything that says Pending? What does that mean to you? 
- How would you start making a new apppointment request?
        - Tell me more, or why is that?

Now, I am going to give you three scenarios I'd like you to work through as if you are using a mobile app to manage your appointment schedule. Feel free to talk aloud, sharing any thoughts you have as you work through it. I will also copy-paste each scenario into the chat feature for you to reference.
- PROMPT: First, you need to make an Optometry appointment request for July 11 2022 in the morning. Once the request is complete, can you find it in the list?   
- PROMPT: Next, you need to confirm the date and time information for any upcoming appointments. 
- PROMPT: Finally, you need to cancel an appointment request. Once the appointment request is canceled, can you find it in the list? 

*When Participant is finished with each task, if they did not talk through it, we will follow up for further insight*
- General thoughts?
- What felt useful?
- What are some pain points?
- If you had questions, where would you go to get answers?
        
**Things to watch: Observe all interactions as the participant interfaces with the Appointments feature in the app. When scanning the list, do they make comments on what data is displayed? Do they expect additional data, and how do they get it?**


## Wrap up

- Thank you for your time. 
- With everything covered today, do you have any more thoughts to share around improving the appointments experience with the VA?
- Anything else in general you want to share about your experience?
- Thanks!
