# Participant 5

## Warm-up

### Did you receive any screening questions: 
* I don’t think so.

### When did you download the [Health and Benefits] app? 
* I have had it for a while.

### What was the motivation? 
* Actually, I think it was on these sessions.

### What was the session about? 
* I think it was when the app was first coming out.

### How frequently do you use it (daily, weekly, monthly)? 
* Um, a couple times a month.

### What do you use it for? 
* To send messages to my doctors and refill the prescription. To check appointments, things like that.

						

## General (Rx at VA)

						

### How do you manage meds today? 
* I am not sure what you mean. Um, if I need more medications I go to refill and I check if I need other refills. If I can’t refill it or something needs changed, I send a secure message

### Do you use the Health and benefits app? 
* Yes

### Do you use other VA tools? 
* Sometimes I will just go to the website if I am not on my phone.

### Which website? 
* myHealtheVet.

### How did you fill a prescription the last time? 
* On the [Health and Benefits app]. I go into the app, go to the prescriptions and it tells you which have refills and which don’t. then you click on it and submit it.

### Thoughts on the experience?
* It was pretty easy.

### Do you have non-VA prescriptions? 
* No.

### Does anyone else help you keep track?
* My daughter

### Is she a veteran too?
* No.

### How does she help you? 
* She is my fiduciary and helps me remember things.
						

Refill Process						

_Research moderator will mostly be in observation mode for this portion of the study. The moderator will invite the participant to speak aloud as they refill a prescription in the app. If the participant does not have an Active prescription to work with, they will walk through their recent experience refilling a prescription in the app._

						

### Does you daughter ever refill the prescriptions for you?
* No _iOS user_

### Does everything look like what you expect?
* Yeah

### Want to refill one today with this feature?
* I can.

### [Does the refill] Thoughts?
* It was pretty easy. 

### Notice any issues? 
* Nope

### Notice anything on details that was helpful or not helpful?
* I am not sure. It looks like how it usually looks to me. It says how many refills you have left and that kind of thing. That is helpful. Then the last time you filled it in is helpful.

### Is there any other information you would add or remove? 
* There is nothing that I can think of that needs to be added or removed.

### How do you know how to take the medication, do you reference the app or bottle, or doctor?
* Usually my bottle.

### Why is that?
* Um because it is right there in my hand when I take it.

### How do you organize meds when you take them?
* Um I don’t really know how to explain how I organize them. I guess I put the smallest ones in the front and the bigger ones in the back

### What do you do when you travel?
* I have a pill organizer for how long I need to take them

### What other reasons do you use this list?
* It tells me how many refills, if something doesn’t have refills, I need to contact the doctor on that. If I need to know everything I am taking it is all right here

### Does that happen often?
* Um not usually. I can remember most of it but sometimes I won’t remember how many milligrams it is.

### If you saw something on here scrolling and don’t recognize it or its confusing, what would be your next step?
* Send a secure message.					

### Is [secure message] effective?
* Ehh.

### What is the most important on this list, key information?
* The names of the medications and milligrams.

### Second most important? 
* How often to take them.

### Do you ever explore the tabs at the top? 
* No that is the first time I have noticed them.

### Any thoughts on the tabs?
* These are refills I ordered that I have not gotten or that the doctor ordered and wasn’t sent. Tracking is if it were on the way to me. [Tracking] has had information sometimes, but it is not always there. They don’t always have tracking information on all prescriptions they mail

### Why do you think that is?
* No idea. Maybe they come from different places I am not sure.

### Is [Tracking] important for you?
* I like to have the tracking information

### Is [Tracking] accurate most of the time?
* Usually if it is there.

### Do your Providers check meds or change them? 
* At my annual visit they will go over my medication and see if changes need to be made.

### The only time you interface with Providers at VA is once a year?
* Unless I need some other type of appointment like specialty appointments throughout the year

### Do you mainly go to the facility [in-person]? 
* Yes.

### What’s it like there, are you able to find where you are going?
* Yes

### Do you get notifications to Check in [to an appointment]? 
* I have but not recently when I went.

### Did you miss not having them? 
* I didn’t notice until you said something, but I could check in on my phone instead of doing it inside.

### Let’s go to the filters. Tap on [Filter by] and tell me any thoughts.
* I have not done this before
* Active are the ones you are currently on. I don’t know why it would be On Hold or Parked. Refill in Process is being refilled. Submitted is a refill, Suspended, Discontinued is not taking anymore, Expired means it is expired. I don’t know what Non-Verified is. Transferred came from an outside provider. And I don’t know what Unknown is.

### What would you do to find out a status where you didn't know the meaning?
* I would send a message

### What if you didn’t get a response to the message?
* I would call, I guess.

### Do you feel like there is a use for filters? And how would you use them?
* Yeah
* I filtered by Active. I like that better because it was listing [the medication] twice as Expired and Discontinued. I like [filtered by Active] a lot better.

### Anything you want to ask about?
* I don’t think so. Nothing else I can think of.

### Talking about not noticing the filters in a general sense when doing it on your end, why is that?
* When I get in here I just start looking at the names.

### You’re just looking for medication names that are top of mind?
* Right. Usually if I am doing it, I try not to forget what to order. It is singularly focused.

### Have you ever gotten a controlled substance? 
* Um that was when I had to request every month to refill. I could not refill it here. I would need to send a message to my doctor.

### Do you understand what Discontinued means?
* I understand what it means but when I am coming to refill, I don’t want to see that. I just want to see the Active ones so I will use that [filter]. It shows 40 now but when filtered it only showed 18. It was a lot easier to look through.

### Do you see where you can request a medication on this screen (list view)? 
* Yes at the top

### Did you notice [the Start refill request button] before?
* I noticed it when looking at the other stuff. 

### What do you think would happen if you tapped the button?
* I don’t know. 
* I don’t think I have done that before. I don’t remember it being there.

### Anything we haven’t touched on in the list?
* I don’t think so.
* Let’s see this [taps Start Refill request button at the top of the list]
*  I do like this. That way you can refill all of them at once instead of individually. I like this

### Do you refill more than one?
* Usually. I try to do it all at one time otherwise I forget. 

### It's more convenient this way?
* Yes

### 15 days prior to needing the medication, what do you think, do you tend to request 15 days before?
* No not usually because I don’t realize I need them until they are almost gone or already gone

### Do you ever miss doses?
* Sometimes but somehow, I end up with backup. I will order refills when needed. That helps me remember.

### How could this tool help you remember, is the 15 days sentence enough?
* I mean I am pretty sure I have heard the doctors tell me that before too. My memory is horrible these days, I do the best I can with refilling them when I remember. It used to send out the refills and you didn’t have to order them every time, but it seems like they stopped doing that

### The Provider will send it out for you without you having to request it?
* Yeah.

### What do you expect to happen after you submit the refill request?
* The request is being sent to the pharmacy and then they do what they do like verifying it, get it ready, and send it out

### Have you ever experienced shipping delays?
* Not usually they are pretty good with the medication.

### When you call the pharmacy directly, do you know the direct number?
* No, I would have to call and ask for the pharmacy
* I haven’t had to [call] so I am not sure, but it should be. I think you can call the VA number and it will say press whatever for the pharmacy.

### That would work for you?
* I think so.
* They will transfer you, sometimes that works well, other times it doesn’t. You will get a voicemail and leave a message but never get a call back. I don’t think I have ever called the pharmacy.

### Does the pharmacy ever change meds or is that taken care of by the provider?
* Yes, my provider takes care of that.

### Talk to me about what you might do with this list. 
* I would scroll through to see the ones I need. I can see that I refilled at the end of March so I don’t need to do that just yet. This one is at the beginning of March so I can refill that one. That one they are already sending a refill. [scrolls through …] Not yet. Already been refilled, not yet. One maybe. That one. And request refills. There we go. 

### You used the form to do that?
* Yes, there’s the Active: Submitted and this is where they say refill in process already.

### Since we have done it two ways, compare them?
* I like the second one [Start refill request at the top] so that I can do it all at once. I can see which need refills instead of doing it one by one. I prefer it this way.

### Was there less information the second way?
* Yeah

### Could you get through it without the detail information? 
* Yes. It seemed like that was just the way to do it so on here I didn’t know I could do it that way. Something. I do prefer that. It was fast and easy.

### Circling back to the medical visit – you said that one is once a year. Do you ever have appointments that are video?
* Um. Not yet, I don't think. There is a super long wait for mental health so I might have one soon.

### How long have you been waiting [for mental health]? 
* Since February. They don’t have anything until October. 

### I wonder if they can do anything about that.
* I don’t know either.
* That worries me because I know other veterans need mental help desperately and to think they aren’t getting it is telling me why they are committing suicide. They aren’t getting the help they need; they are crying out for help and can’t get it. Hopefully they will do something about that. I asked for Community Care and there was a wait for that too. That’s when they offered the virtual appointment, I said that’s fine. Just some kind of help. Hopefully faster than October.

### Is that your typical experience with VA?
* Yeah, it has been lately. You can’t always get the help you need in a reasonable time frame and lack of communication is a problem too. I called for an appointment so they cancelled the annual and gave me a sooner annual instead of what I needed to be seen and didn’t tell me that. Then they didn’t see me for anything I needed to be seen for. 
* It’s not just the VA, it was an ER too. I was assaulted, they didn’t exam me or clean anything. Nothing. Sent me for x-rays and then it was like “nothing's broken …bye”. I was in the medical field. I know that’s not how it is supposed to be.

### The doctor that you mentioned retired: was that was at VA?
* Yeah, she was at VA. You have to care about people to have one of those jobs.

### Walking through the Healthcare feature, is there anything else you see here that you’d use? 
* I like that I can check my appointments here because when I put it in my phone they sometimes end up on a different date. I tap and then go look for it and can’t find it.

### I wonder if that would happen today. We can check. 
* [Checks Appointments list in app] Nope it stayed in the right place this time.

### Do you use the app with your phone’s calendar? 
* Yes, everything won’t send it to the calendar. So, some things need to be manually entered.

### I heard [the app] has an Add to calendar button, so I was wondering if you use that?
* I don’t know let’s check it out. [Looks at Appointment details, taps Add to calendar. Then looks at the device calendar to validate] 
* There it is.

### Is that the right day too?
* Yeah. I put [the first event] in there myself. I didn’t know it could do that, but I like that. I like that a whole lot better.

### Let’s look at the vaccine records. What are some thoughts?
* That is pretty helpful. I wish I had thought to look here the other day. When I was assaulted (bitten) I was asked if my Tetanus was up to date. It shows it right here.

### Do you think it could act as a reference so that [care providers at the ER] would not give it to you twice?
* They might but I think it goes into the system to update your shots.

### It sounds like having this List of vaccines is empowering. 

* Yes. It is convenient and easy to get to too. I feel like the app is easier to use than the regular website.

### Why is that?
* I mean, just because everything you need is right here and you have to look for what you need when on the website.

### You’ve said that you use myHealtheVet, do you va.gov as well?
* I have been, yeah. 

### Do you have any preference between websites?
* Uhh I think I prefer va.gov.

### Why?
* It is easier to navigate. You can find what you are looking for easier on there. It has a little bit more of an updated look than my HealtheVet.
