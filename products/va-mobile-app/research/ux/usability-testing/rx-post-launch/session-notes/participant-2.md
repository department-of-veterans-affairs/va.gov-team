# Participant 2

## Warm-up						 								 \
### When did you download the app? 
* I have all of the VA apps I think it is the VA Rx apps. Hold on. I will go and get that one. I am installing it really fast. I have the app it is the flagship app, if you would have called it that I would have known I had it. In my normal job I wrote with the team that made the app because we are doing research for our agency.
 							

### When was this?
* About a year ago, not for a while.


### When did you download VA health and benefits app? 
* When it first came out . I had it on android first now on iPhone. The day I bought it.

						
### How frequently do you use it (daily, weekly, monthly)? 
* More frequently because it notifies me of messages of doctor appointments. I know it was longer than 45 days when I first got it. Now a few times a month mainly because I use community care. Organically it wasn’t notifying me of community care appointments but now it does so I message popups up telling me I have an appointment at least 2-3 times a month.


### What do you use it for? 
* Appointments, when I need letters. Actually, is one of the best reasons for the app. On eBenefits it won’t generate the letters and give an error. The app works perfect for commissary letter and disability letters. Refilling the prescriptions.


### Anything else used? 
* No. before the app I would use the website to request the refill. The website was always glitchy, so I had to login multiple times to get in. now that it is on the phone I just do it there


### What website? 
* my HealtheVet
* I would login for eBenefits because it’s bookmarked then get to my HealtheVet from there.


### Do you get there from Va.gov? 
* No, I will use va.gov when searching for something specific. Like today I got a bill for my wife and she gets CHAMPVA so I went to VA.gov to find the contact number. Other than that, now. If it’s something I have to search for I will go to va.gov. everything else I need is in the app. \
	

## General (Rx at VA)
 How did you fill a prescription the last time? 
* Right through the RX app. Last time doing that was within 90 days.

First time doing it in the app? 
* No, I didn’t know that was a thing. I know it must be recent because I talked with the team and I told them it would be nice to have it within that app.
* It logged me in automatically. I used biometrics because why should a user have to type in the username and password for everything.

## Refill Process
_Research moderator will mostly be in observation mode for this portion of the study. The moderator will invite the participant to speak aloud as they refill a prescription in the app. If the participant does not have an Active prescription to work with, they will walk through their recent experience refilling a prescription in the app._

### General thoughts?
* That [prescription] wasn’t marked as Expired 4 days ago. There’s some usability for you. So I don’t tend to look at the bottom third of the screen so [it appears that] the medication I am coming to refill is Expired and there aren’t any refills left. Then by scrolling I realize it is the old one and the new one is below it. It would be nice if the expired ones are at the bottom so the current ones . I was going to refill [another prescription] too, but its Discontinued and then my Active one is right below. I know to keep scrolling but it could be confusing for people.


### Why would that be confusing? 
* Well, the first thing I see is expired so I might have just left the app and called.


### To you, what does Expired mean? 
* I need to call my doctor or VA to get it refilled. To tell you the truth I don’t pay attention to the fill date to know that it is an old one. Maybe there’s something else.


### Need to refill? 
* I left both of these [prescriptions] so I could do this today. I assume I just click on the card. But click on the card in the middle isn’t doing anything so I then assume [to tap] Get prescription details and then Request a refill. That is straightforward.


### Thoughts on the process?
* It is easy and as a developer I appreciate the double confirmation, so you don’t do it by accident. As a user I don’t like it, but I get it. My thoughts on this screen is that it took me a while to find the Close button. It took me a while to see the button at the top which will get me back to where I can refill another. I assume going to All Pending refills will take me just to refill orders. For me personally, I would assume closing it takes me back to my list. It would be nice to have a Refill another button.

						
### What would the Refill another button do?
* Bring you back to the list. As soon as this popup up and I didn’t know to stop I would have clicked the bottom button without reading it because that’s what it seems like I should have done.
* I would have seen the green at the top then go to refills. Now that I am working through it, it is easier than the close button because then I click on All due to it being a similar layout of my HealtheVet. So, I can just click on that. I hate the scrolling and really wish it was sorted by Active. Then close just brings you back to [taps Close] …that’s weird. In my mind that [interaction] is unexpected. I tapped Close on the confirmation screen, I thought it would take me back to where I was, well it did. This is the screen I Requested a refill. For some reason in my head, I thought it would take me back to the list. In my head that’s where we came from but I get that [the Detail screen] is actually where I came from.


### What would have been more helpful? 
* Now at this point, I don’t care about this prescription so it would have been more useful to end up at the List. I think of it as the list. It would have been helpful to come here and click on the next to refill. When I click Close I had it in my mind that I was coming here. It bothers me that you can’t click the whole card, having to click Get details at the bottom. Several times I tried to tap the whole card in the middle to open it. That’s the majority of apps the cards are clickable. Even other screens in this app when I started, they are clickable cards. I have tapped the card about 25 times just right now. Coming here threw off my thought process because I really expected to come back to [the list]. It just felt right to come back to [the list].
* I love that they are here. I would have known sooner if the RXRefill app would have informed me. I can still refill through that so if there was a notification that it is now in the health and benefits app. I would have been using it than. I didn’t even know this was in here.


### How do you learn about new tools? 
* I won't lie, it is normally word of mouth. I know I get emails. Unless it is an official one telling me about me, my benefits, or my appointments I don’t read them. If it is a VA in the news email I don’t have enough time.


### You stick with what works? 
* Yeah. Again, if something had popped up telling me I could do it in here I would have used it before today. I didn’t know even in the emails that this is the one I should do it in because I have RX.


### What do the prescriptions in the Pending tab mean? 
* Pending are ones that I requested that have not been refilled yet.


### What do you think will happen now that you’ve Requested the refill?
* I would hope that they are going to be mailed out soon. That happened in the past, I don’t think it would be different than any other avenue.


### How do you track refills?
* So I come back in 2 days later to see tracking and I use USPS and UPS information where it tells you what is coming. Sometimes those apps beat me to the punch and sometimes I will get notifications that it has shipped through VA. After that I don’t use VA to track, I use the other apps because I know the package is coming. One time I had to go back into the Rx refill app because what happened occurred that there was a package, I tracked it, and only 1 prescription was in it so I had to go see what was going on with my second one.


### Troubleshoot on your own? 
* Yes. As a government employee I try not to waste time of other government employees. It’s not just the government it really is with everything.
* I could do a sort by refills left but it went automatically too high to low. I would have thought automatically coming to this page that it would have been like this.


### Do you sort? 
* It bothers me when I have to. I am used to having to sort lists a lot but I am also used to them being how they, I think, they should be. So, most important thing at the top. In this situation the ones that aren’t Expired or Discontinued. I don’t care about those anymore, they could just disappear. There’s nothing I can do with them. Maybe if I wanted to see a history but to tell you the truth, I wouldn’t click on it because I don’t care about them at all. Not to say that in the future I wouldn’t if a doctor in the future needed to know but that has never happened.


### How do you manage outside prescriptions?
* Just for my kids but they are through CHAMPVA. They go to the doctor and then the prescription shows up in the mail.


### So you don’t need to manage that? 
* Correct. Go to Filter: oh I just went to Sort.


### Why did you only see Sort and not Filter?
* I have no idea. To me when I came in here as a list to see what I need to see I would have just done the sort to have the most important things. To me I did not think to filter by Active. Maybe because I don’t really use Filters.
* I say I don’t use them much but the only time I have ever used a filter in the last month was when I needed to filter a list of car chargers for a trip. That may be why I did not notice the filter was there.

						
### Let’s tap into the Filters. Looking at the list, do you know what they mean? 
* Some of them I don’t understand. Active I get. Active: On Hold I don’t know, [Active]: Parked I don’t know, Refilled I get, Submitted, I assumed that means I submitted a refill, and it hasn’t been processed. Suspended, I am not sure. Discontinued, it went past the time and Expired are the same thing. I don’t pay attention to those ones. Non-Verified I can guess but I don’t know. I don’t know why I would have a Non-verified. I think they would only be verified through the doctor. Transferred I never had one but I assume if it was CVS to VA..? Unknown I know that means you don’t know the status but why would it be in an Unknown status?
			

### It seems that you only know a few but there’s a large list. 
* Yeah, maybe because I haven’t had [any prescriptions with] that status. I don’t know what a Suspended one is. It sounds bad.


### Where would you go if you don’t know what it means? 
* I have no idea on this. I wouldn’t even look it up. If I had one in those status, I know there’s the information button next to it so I would click the I and it would tell me. I would do that. Other than that, I would Google it, or Bing is good now I could Bing it.
* If it said Active Suspended, I would see what it means but just by clicking on the Filter list I wouldn’t look it up until my prescription is in one of those status.


### Refill did what you expect? 
* Yes I am sure I will get my prescriptions


### What do you see on the cards?
* So I do like that it has the medication instructions. That is helpful. The nasal spray for migraines if I don’t have it with me which I don’t 9/10 times. This could be helpful if I need my wife to do it and go into the app for the instructions. That is helpful. Refills left helpful. If I come in to refill and it says refill 1 I know to contact the doctor to put in more. Even more which I don’t know if it exists if it says refill medication and there was 1 left it would be helpful if a popup came up that says this is your last refill.


### What would you do with the information? 
* I would call yam doctor. Even at the VA I would put in a message to my doctor. Like this one I have 4 refills for 90 days and I am on it for the rest of my life, so I know I need a new prescription put in when I need it.


### Was there ever a time where you tried to request a refill and there weren’t any left? 
* Yeah, I was going to mention that. It would be nice to have a push notification like this. To have something pop up saying if only one [refill] is left and it will Expire, to be notified would be nice. I had one arrive late but it got to the end time so I couldn’t request the refill and I was running low and had to have a new prescription and its longer than getting a refill so a notification would be nice.


### How long does it take?
* So depending on the day of the week, mine have happened on a Friday and they don’t get to it that day. So, they get it on a Monday, my app for the doctor will tell me it is sent that day or the next, shipment form the VA arrives 5-6 days later. So I might not have it for a 1.5 weeks later.


### Could cause missed doses? 
* Yes. Migraine medication is for situations it would be a tough time because I can’t do anything and that’s the only medication that stops them. I keep a good stock of them. If I have three migraines I can deplete that prescription quickly. Going without it would be more of a problem. It would be much different than my cholesterol medication. If the cholesterol was one that I needed to live off of it could be a big problem. I don’t know if it a community care thing. I know it was a bit quicker when I was seen at the va. I think the VA doctor and VA pharmacy works a bit better than community care. If it really came down to it I do know my doctor can call it in and I can go into the VA and pick it up.


### Alert would have to start the process earlier? 
* Yes the drive is 45 minutes. I could go to Baltimore to get it and its 40 minutes but that’s downtown Baltimore. If it’s a migraine I can’t drive. I don’t know if my wife can get the prescription for me she would need to call and ask. I would call the on-call doctor if I had a migraine and have them send it to CVS and I would pay out of pocket because 1.5 hour round trip would be back. I would rather get it in the next 30 minutes.

### What about the Detail screen? 
* It tells me how to take it, refills .Fill date and location facility I don’t care about. In here it is nice to see when it expires if I tracked that. Its pretty cool that its there, you could do push notifications 30 days out. If I tracked it, I would have it on the calendar and track when it needs to be refilled. I keep downplaying the cholesterol medicine. It won't kill me, right now my life does not depend on it but if it did I would have it in my calendar when it expires and when to request refills. Me personally I don’t think about when it will. My wife is my pharmacy she gives me my medication and she tells me and now I will be coming here to refill it. If it was a life threatening medication I would have a calendar reminder. I could see it being useful, Add refill to my calendar. Something to add it to my apple calendar automatedly. A way to track yes. 


### Have you had a controlled substance from VA? 
* Yes, in the past


### What was the workflow to get it?
* From what I remember they were a pain. I had to go to the pharmacy. once or twice near the end I was able to request it on the website but that came, signature required, it was certified mail, and it took a lot longer to get it. I understand that.


### Give back program? 
* When I stopped taking the stuff, I had left over the local sheriff’s department had one of those.

						
## Closing

### Wave magic wand on the app, what would you change? 
* This is my favorite question. I love the open-ended, tell me what you want question. I am not a good person for this. Yesterday I would have told you I want prescriptions in here and you know, that’s in here. I just wasn’t aware. That’s the one thing I felt was missing. Nothing else. I know there is Compose a message in here. Well, that went away. So, it’s the same as the website. That’s here. Everything I need to do is in [the app]. 
* I like this time because this is when I tell you what I want. Me personally I don’t need anything else in here. I don’t know if you can start a claim. That might be nice, but I am already at 100 percent. Its all there. I am trying to come up with something. My magic wand wish already came true and now I can delete an app off my phone. I have [an apostrophe] in my last name, can someone do that because it bothers me when my name isn’t spelled right. Let’s see what my veteran ID says. My name is wrong in the system, not in the app.


### What would you tell people about this?
* I already tell them to use the app. The website sucks use the app. I even had people tell me there were issues with letters and its nice to save it on my phone instead of emailing it to me.
