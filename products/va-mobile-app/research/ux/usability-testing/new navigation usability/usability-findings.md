## Research Goals

The VA Health and Benefits mobile app was launched in July 2021. As the app grows in its feature set, we want to ensure the structure and organization of the app makes sense to Veterans and can accommodate the new features we have identified as being of interest on our product roadmap. 

The purpose of this work is to inform the information architecture, content and design of the VA Mobile app in order to deliver a solution that is usable, useful, and extensible. See [VA Mobile App: Information Architecture & Navigation - High Level Summary](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-design/information-architecture-navigation/High%20Level%20Project%20Summary.md) for a high level summary of the entire 3-phase process. 

This particular study will help us identify opportunities to improve the planned information architecture and navigation pattern for the app before we update them as part of the Mobile App Navigation redesign project.

Our goals in this study are to:

**Primary:**
1. Evaluate the usability of the proposed navigation pattern and information architecture (based on the Closed Card Sort findings) using a series of tasks the participants will be asked to complete.
2. Determine if any significant navigational barriers exist for participants who are current users of the mobile app vs participants who are not users of the mobile app.

**Secondary:**
1. Pilot conducting remote, evaluative research using Figma prototypes in the browser on participants’ mobile devices, and improve the instructions and process for that in preparation for future usability studies.

## Research Questions

1. Are participants able to successfully navigate to key tasks in the app using the updated information architecture and navigation?
    1. Which tasks, if any, do participants struggle with finding and where do participants expect to find those tasks?
    2. Does previous use of the VA Health and Benefits mobile app affect how participants expect to navigate to key tasks or ability to successfully complete tasks?
2. Are the new category labels (Payments, Benefits) clear and understandable to participants?
3. Does the increased depth of hierarchy (ex: Claims now being under Benefits) affect participants’ perception of ease of use?
4. What, if anything, would participants want to change about the proposed information architecture and navigation?
5. What, if anything, are people expressing positive reactions to? How are they reacting?


## Methodology

We conducted remote, moderated, think-aloud user interviews with usability testing over Zoom with 13 participants representing a mixture of app users and non-app users. We sent participants a link to a limited functionality, web-based prototype and then asked them to open it on their mobile device and to share their screen with us while completing a series of tasks.

* 5 participants were current users of the VA Health and Benefits mobile app
* 5 participants were not current users of the VA Health and Benefits mobile app
* 3 participants we were uncertain whether or not they used the app based on recruiting + answers interview questions

* 12 participants used either an iPhone (6) or Android (6) mobile device. 
* One participant used a desktop prototype. 

### Study tasks

The tasks tested in the study required the participant to explore each part of the proposed IA and navigation, and they represent a combination of features with the highest engagement in the mobile app as well as features that have moved locations. This includes:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Task</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Location/change</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Difficulty</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Update your email address
   </td>
   <td>Profile (new location in nav UI)
   </td>
   <td>Medium
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Check your disability rating
   </td>
   <td>Benefits (moved from Profile to new category)
   </td>
   <td>Medium
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Check the date of your upcoming doctor appointment
   </td>
   <td>Health (no change)
   </td>
   <td>Easy
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Check your most recent disability payment 
   </td>
   <td>Payments (moved from Profile to new category)
   </td>
   <td>Medium
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Check the status of your disability claim
   </td>
   <td>Benefits (new category name)
   </td>
   <td>Easy
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


Task completion was scored on a 4 point scale, measuring the effectiveness of the proposed solution:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td colspan="2" ><strong>4 - directly successful</strong> (participant went directly to the correct place)
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td colspan="2" ><strong>3 - indirectly successful </strong>(participant did not go directly to correct place, but found their way there without help)
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td colspan="2" ><strong>2 - could complete with help</strong> (participant required moderator to give them a hint or return them to home screen)
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td colspan="2" ><strong>1 - did not understand/couldn't complete </strong>(participant was stuck or incorrect, even with help)
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

1. Participants will be able to find the provided tasks using the proposed navigation pattern and information architecture.
    1. TRUE: An overwhelming majority of participants were able to complete each of  the 5 provided tasks successfully.
    2. Participants who are current VA Health and Benefits mobile app users may first look for some tasks (payments, disability rating) in Profile before discovering them in Payments and Benefits, but will be successful overall.
        1. FALSE and TRUE: Only one participant first looked for their disability rating first in Profile and no participants expected to find their latest benefit payment in Profile. All participants who are current mobile app users were successful in finding the new location for tasks that are currently located in Profile in the live app.
2. The new category labels (Payments, Benefits) will be clear & understandable to users. 
TRUE: In addition to 13/13 participants successfully completing the tasks in these categories, the majority of participants correctly predicted items they would find in each of the new categories. 

3. The introduction of the Benefits category will NOT cause participants to feel that the app is slower/harder to use. 
TRUE: When asked to compare the prototype with their experience using the current app, 5/5 participants who are current app users said it was the same or easier to use than the current app.).


## Key Findings

1. **An overwhelming majority of participants were able to complete each of the 5 provided tasks successfully.**
For 4 of the tasks, 13/13 participants were directly or indirectly successful. For 1 of the tasks (updating email address), 11/13 participants were directly successful or successful with help. 

2. **Previous app usage did not seem to significantly affect participants' expectations around the location of tasks in the prototype.**
    1. There was no significant difference in the way participants who were current users of the app vs participants who were not users of the app navigated the prototype.
    2. All participants who are current app users reported that the prototype was the same or easier to use than the current app. 

3. **The new category labels (Benefits and Payments) were clear and understandable to participants.**  
In addition to 13/13 participants successfully completing the tasks in these categories, most participants correctly predicted things that they would find in each of the new categories (though the specific things named varied between participants): 
    1. Within Payments, a strong majority of participants initially expected that they would see money paid to them from VA. Most participants also expected that they would find money they owed to VA.
    2. When asked later what they expected to find in “outstanding debts” (within the Payments category), a strong majority of participants expected that they would find money they owed to the VA, suggesting both that this label is clear and understandable (regardless of personal context) and that for the participants who *didn’t initially expect* to find money paid to the VA, that the Payments section was learnable. 

4. **Increased depth of hierarchy (ex: Claims now being under Benefits) did not seem to affect app users’ perceptions of ease of use.** 
5. When asked to compare the prototype with their experience using the current app, **5/5 participants who are current app users reported that the prototype was the same or easier to use than the current app**.

### Secondary findings

1. **Participants also had positive reactions to the following things:**
    1. App is simple, easy to understand
    2. Combined nature of the app’s feature set (Everything you need in once place)
    3. Several participants described the prototype/aspects of the prototype as “Personalized”
    4. Name and branch of service displayed on Home 
    5. Tab bar serving as a reminder/guide
    6. Being able to switch back & forth between categories (Health & Payments, Benefits & Payments) 

2. **Only one participant mentioned wanting to change anything about the app’s top level navigation, and a few participants mentioned the placement or prominence of feature level content:**
    1. Payments (1/13) desire to be less prominent, relative to the importance of the task to them).
    2. Messages (2/13 desire to be more prominent)
    3.  Home screen content (3/13 desire for less prominence)
    4. Manage dependents (1/13 desire to change location)
    5. Name and branch of service (1/13 desire for less prominence)

### Findings: Research ops

1. There were **no technical issues with method/script for screen–sharing web-based Figma app on participants’ phones.**
2. We had difficulty vetting VA mobile app users during recruitment: **Several participants reported being app users (and passed our screening process), but answers to questions about their app use were not consistent with what’s possible in the app.** 
3. When guiding users through how to close the prototype, **several participants seemed surprised or commented upon seeing their open browser tabs** alongside the prototype tab.

### Research questions, answered

1. **Are participants able to successfully navigate to key tasks in the app using the updated information architecture and navigation?**   
   **Yes.** For 4 of the tasks, 13/13 participants were directly or indirectly successful. For 1 of the tasks (updating email address), 11/13 participants were directly successful or successful with help.

2. **Which tasks, if any, do participants struggle with finding and where do participants expect to find those tasks?** 

   Update email address was the only task where _any_ participants initially expected to complete the task in a location other than what is in the prototype, and eventually all but 2 participants were successful in completing the task.
    1. 9/13 participants initially expected to go to Profile to update their email address:
       > P10 "Traditionally most apps/websites have the primary personal info stored there."

       > P13 "I expect to see Home, email, your phone number, your address, all your personal information in your profile."
    2. 4/13 participants (P2, P5, P6, P14) initially expected to update their email address through Contact the VA (on the Home screen), and described expecting to speak to a person at VA to make the change:
       > P5 “I would think if I go to Contact VA—they would ask for updated information like phone number or address… I would expect to talk to someone who could make [the changes] for me.”
    3. With prompting (“What if you could do it yourself, in the app”), 2 of those 4 participants then successfully located the place to update their email address in Profile.
       > P6 “I would go to Contact VA. Should be a place for me to communicate with them and give them my information, my email address or contact them if I have an Issue. _(What if you could change it yourself, using the app?_) I'd expect to find it under Contact VA. Wait a minute, wait a minute, up at the top I see Profile, let me try that.”
       1. 3/4 participants (P5, P6, P14) who expected to go to Contact VA to complete updating their email address reported a cognitive disability during recruiting. Rec: Further research to understand whether their disability influences their methods/preference for this task as well as more information about how all Veterans prefer to complete this task.
       2. 1 participant (P14) who failed the email task (and who described recently updating his personal information by calling VA) did successfully identify where they would update their app login settings (Profile > Settings) task. 
    4. The information listed above surrounds the instances where participants were not directly successful. This leads us to believe that their task success ratings may be due to a participant’s preference around how to update personal information with VA rather than a problem understanding or navigating the app.

3. **Does previous use of the VA Health and Benefits mobile app affect how participants expect to navigate to key tasks or ability to successfully complete tasks?**

   Previous app usage did *not* seem to significantly affect participants' expectations around the location of or their ability to successfully complete tasks in the prototype.
    1. **Task 1: (Update email)** 11/13 participants were successful—app users fared slightly better.
       1. 5/5 app users were directly successful.
       2. 3/5 non-app users were directly successful, 1 was successful with help, and 1 was not successful.
    2. **Task 2: (Disability rating)** All participants were successful, but non-app users fared slightly better. 
       1. 4/5 app users were directly successful and 1 was indirectly successful (expecting it first to be in Profile, its current location in the live app).
       2.  5/5 non-app users were directly successful. 
    3. **Task 3: (Appointments)** No difference - all participants were directly successful.
    4. **Task 4: (Benefits payment)** No difference - all participants were directly successful.
    5. **Task 5: (Claim status)** All participants were successful—non-app users fared slightly better. 
       1. 4/5 app users were directly successful and 1 was indirectly successful (expecting it to be in Benefits, but in a different location).
       2. 5/5 of non-app users were directly successful.

4. **Are the new category labels (Payments, Benefits) clear & understandable to participants?**
**Yes.** In addition to 13/13 participants successfully completing the tasks in these categories, most participants correctly predicted things that they would find in each of the new categories (though the specific things named varied between participants). 
    1. **Benefits:**
       1. When asked what they’d expect to find in “Benefits,” 12/13 participants correctly predicted at least one of the category items. The most frequently mentioned were items related to disability (compensation, benefits, claims, or percentage—10/13), and education (6/13). Also mentioned were healthcare, home loans, letters, forms, and dependant info 
       2. My benefits vs benefits I’m eligible for:
            1. 11/13 participants mentioned expecting to find benefits they were interacting with.
            2. 4 participants specified that they also expected to also find benefits they were eligible for (P4, P14, P19, P21).
            3. 1 participant (P18) expected it to be general information about benefits, not personal interactions with them. 
    2. **Payments:** 
       1. When asked what they’d expect to find in the “Payments” category, participants expected two main things (but not always both):
            1. **A record of payments from the VA:** 12/13 participants expected that they would see money paid to them from VA. The most frequently mentioned type of payment was payment related to disability (9/13). 
            2. **A record of money owed to the VA**: 8/13 participants expected that they would find money they owed to VA (even though some of those folks had never owed money to VA themselves). The most frequently mentioned type of money owed to the VA was a copay of some kind (6/13).
                 > P14: “Payments the VA makes to me. View the Payment level related to disability claim, seeing the amount. Seeing dependent payment info.”

                 > P21: "Whether it was payments to me or from me, I guess I would expect to find it all in the same area, maybe".
       2. When asked later what they expected to find in “outstanding debts” (within the Payments category), 12/13 participants expected that they would find money they owed to the VA, suggesting both that this label is clear and understandable (regardless of personal context) and that for the participants who *didn’t initially expect* to find money paid to the VA, that the Payments section was learnable.
            1. The most frequently mentioned type of money owed were copays (5/13) and overpayment (4/13). Also mentioned were loans and VA health locations.
                 > P21: "I would be looking for my Pharmacy copayments—even though it's not considered a collectible debt, it's still a debt, also if I had been overpaid, or if for some reason I'm owing the VA money for something."
            2. 1 participant was unaware that debts to the VA were possible:
                 > P10 “Wow. I am thinking… how someone could owe the VA money?”
                
   Labels: PRDT: VA-mobile-app, RESRCH: Usability, HDW: Smartphone, BNFT: Disability, BNFT: Finances, BNFT: Healthcare, BNFT: Education, BNFT: Housing


5. **Does the increased depth of hierarchy (ex: Claims now being under Benefits) affect participants’ perception of ease of use?** 
No. When asked to compare the prototype with their experience using the current app, 5/5 participants who are current app users reported that the prototype was the same or easier to use than the current app.
    > P4 “It seemed very similar to what currently exists. Benefits felt different, but I don't know why exactly.”

    > P10 "I like the one we just looked at. The prototype, it just seems to be like, say more, eye-friendly, and [the tab bar] at the bottom in the ballpark where you're going, to which one of those icons you're going to. It wasn't overwhelming, but the current version stuff is too much in your face…"

6. **What, if anything, would participants want to change about the proposed information architecture and navigation?** 
    1. **Top level navigation:** When asked what they disliked about the prototype, only 1 participant mentioned anything related to top level navigation:
       > P4 “I feel the space used for Payments could be used for something else. Personal bias, but Messages or a Notification area. The things I would use the app for should be right up front instead of going deeper into the app [to access features]” 

       > P4 “Why would Payments have such a prominent place in the app? I pretty much know what the payment is going to be each month. If I log in, it’s just for healthcare and benefits. It feels like it doesn't belong, but not sure where else to put it.” 

    2. **Feature level content:** Several participants mentioned mentioned the placement or prominence of feature level content:
       1. **Home screen:** 3/13 participants mentioned the prominence of the evergreen home screen content
            > P4 Questioning About VA links: “This [about VA] is stuff I can find on the website - not about me…seems a little high [in the hierarchy] for what I want to do here. COVID-19 updates are less relevant.”

             > P2 [Referring to Contact VA, Find location, COVID-19)] "I can tell you these links are probably not updated. It takes a long time for the VA to update anything.” 

             > P22 “‘COVID updates’ and ‘Find a location’ are taking up space. People are so over COVID… Contact VA seems redundant because you are on the app. I know the VA phone number already." ‘Find a VA location’ would be good if traveling. [Home screen content] doesn't pertain to me. Anything you can squish down and make simpler is wonderful." "It would make me feel in control and not so lost [if tab bar content were on home screen]"

    3. **Prominence of Messages:** 2/13 participants thought Messages should be higher up in the IA:
       > P10 "Maybe Contact Provider should be [more hierarchical]." 

       > P4 “I feel the space used for Payments could be used for something else. Personal bias, but Messages or a Notification area. The things I would use the app for should be right up front instead of going deeper into the app [to access features]”

       > P22 [Referring to Home screen content “Contact VA is not something I'd do here, but secure messaging is.”

    4. **Name and branch of service displayed on Home:** 1 participant questioned the prominence of their name on the Home screen:
       > P4 “I don't know why it says my name, I know who I am.”

    5. **Manage dependents** 1 participant expected to see Manage dependents in both their Profile and Benefits section:
       > P19 "I would expect Manage dependents to be under Profile. If I am actively receiving benefits, I would expect them to be in Benefits. If I am not receiving any benefits from my dependents, under my Profile, they should still be listed. In Benefits, I would expect them to show in an [inactive state]”.

7. **What, if anything, are people expressing positive reactions to? How are they reacting?**
    1. **Simple, easy to understand (6/13)**
       > P6 “Not as complicated, on the desktop there's a lot more information and stuff to choose from, this is a lot more simplistic.”

       > P14 “Clear, was easy to understand. Using new devices, you have to get used to it. It would take a bit of time, is that the right place to go? But it’s easy enough to figure out. I've used [VA services] quite a bit so I would know an idea of what to click."

       > P19 "It’s straightforward, user friendly. From my experience, stuff is grouped logically. I can't speak to a new user's perspective, but the stuff is grouped in a similar manner to the web… I can drill down in a clear logical manner.”

    2. **Everything you need in one (4/13)**
       > P5 “It's great. You need to implement it as soon as possible. Everything you need to do without searching around.“

       > P12 “Everything you need in one place.”

       > P13 "YAY! A one stop shop!" "I would use it a lot. I like it because I'd be able to share with other Veterans. This one I can tell them, its one app to do everything you need to do on there."

       > P21 "All can be done on the website, but it’s not very intuitive. So this would be one stop shopping."

    3. **Name and branch of service displayed on Home (4/13)**
       > P10 “My name was there, had my branch of service, that was cool. Kind of giving me a shoutout. ” [things are] "personalized". "It knows me, knows my branch of service.”

       > P13 “I can see my name and then it tells you the branch of service on the bottom and you know I love that. I'm proud of that service and I like it.”

       > P18 "a cool touch. Another little personalization that says you're more than just we. We've been regarded for far too long as you just name rank and serial number. But to have that little touch back. To, okay, I wasn't just, i'm not just a VA person. I'm a navy person who is with VA. Thank you."

    4. **Tab bar reminds/guides (3/13)**
       > P2 “When I’m in ‘VA mode,’ the [tab bar] icons are reminders of other things I need to do.”

       > P10 "Down at the bottom [the tab bar], you can kinda guess in the ballpark which one of those Icons you're going to use to get you to where you want to pretty quickly.”

    5. **Being able to switch back & forth between categories—Health & Payments, Benefits & payments (3/13)**
       > P12 “Easy to navigate [between categories] with [tab bar].”

       > P19 Described switching between Benefits & Payments categories to check % and payments being received.

## Additional Insights

1. **When asked 'What are some of the things that you think you could do from here that are important to you?'** 
    1. The most commonly mentioned thing was “Health” or something specific in the health category (8/13)
    2. Other items mentioned were Benefits (4/13), Payments (4/13), and Links that tell me about the VA—(including Contact us the VA & VA locations (4/13) and Veterans Crisis Line (3/13).
  
2. **What stood out to you first?** 
    1. 6 participants said that their name and emblem for service stood out to them first (P4, P6, P10, P13, P20, P22)
    2. 5 participants were drawn first to the About VA section on the homescreen. (P2, P5, P14, P19, P21)
       > P19 "My eyes are personally drawn to [Contact VA], and Find a VA location. If I was new to the system, that's where I would go for information or getting questions answered. Find a VA location, I think, is similar to a Google search. COVID is self explanatory"
    
3. **Pain points:**
    1. **Problems with Sign in/passwords:**
    **4 participants mentioned issues with sign in or passwords in current app and VA websites (P5, P10, P12, P13)**
       > P13 "I have a TBI and it is so frustrating to remember all my passwords (and go through login over and over and over)" 

    2. **Didn’t notice Messages feature**: 
4 participants mentioned that they didn’t notice Messages (wasn’t included as a study task, but identified by participants as important to them). 
    3. **Profile/Email:**
Several participants did not see the save button in the top right corner (but commented on the delete email link)
    4. **Phone is too small:**
1 participant mentioned an issue with screen size
       > P13 “The reason I wouldn't use it is visual, phone too small. I have an iPad and use it because its bigger. I would use it on my iPad if available.”

4. **Research Ops:**
    1. **Recruitment Issues - difficulty vetting app users**
    Several participants reported being app users (and passed our screening process: first, asking them to confirm they had the app using an image of the app’s icon and later asking them to confirm the language displayed at the top of the app’s logged in home screen), but answers to questions about their app use are not consistent with what’s possible in the app.
       1. One participant referred to various websites as "apps" on desktop & phone.
       2. We also noticed that when saving a shortcut to VA.gov, the icon is nearly identical to the app’s icon (navy blue is slightly different). May want to consider alternate ways of determining whether participants are app users for recruiting.
    2. **Research method:**
       1. No technical issues with method/script for screen–sharing web-based Figma app on participants’ phones.
       2. When guiding users through how to close the prototype, a few participants seemed surprised or commented upon seeing their open browser tabs alongside the prototype tab.


## Recommendations

* **Overall IA & navigation model:**
    * Move forward with proposed information architecture, navigation pattern and labels.
* **Home screen:**
    * Keep name and service badge as a personalized element on the home screen.
    * Think through the home screen hierarchy and treatment of the non-personalized content vs the personalized content when moving into the next phase of design.
    * Consider a cross-reference for manually updating email address within Contact VA.
    * Consider a potential higher placement for messages within the app’s hierarchy.
    * Investigate moving Manage Dependents into the Profile section.
* **Research ops:**
    * Continue to iterate on the app user vetting method within our recruiting process.
    * Use web-based Figma prototype method and section of protocol in future mobile studies.
    * Modify prototype-related protocol to better preserve participant privacy related to browser history.
* **Individual screen design & hierarchy:**
    * Consider a cross-reference for manually updating email address within Contact VA.
    * Consider a potential higher placement for messages within the app’s hierarchy.
    * Investigate moving Manage Dependents into the Profile section.
    * Consider modifying the treatment of the save button on the Email Address screen.


## Next Steps

Apply learnings to next round of high fidelity navigation, category, and individual screen design work.

### Who participated in the study

We had 13 participants complete the usability study, all but one using mobile devices. 
* 5 participants were current users of the VA mobile app.
* 5 participants were not users of the VA mobile app*.
* In the case of 3 participants, we’re not certain— they reported that they were users of the mobile app during recruitment, but based on answers to questions during the interview, are likely not actually users of the app.

*Two of these participants reported that they were users of the app during recruitment but then told us they were not during the interview.
