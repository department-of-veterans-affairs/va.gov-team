## **Moderator logistics**


### 2-3 days before the session:



* Review VA Platform's [Research Checklist](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Checklist.1958773011.html#ResearchChecklist-5.Conductsessions).
* Complete any project-specific setup tasks for this study


### Day of the session:



* Use [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/messages/C40B45NJK/details/) in Slack for real-time feedback from observers.
* Mute your Slack notifications.
* Send out the [observer instructions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Observer-guidelines.1622311177.html) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel)).


### Starting the session:



* In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute.
* In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked
* Check your [screensharing setup] and share permissions for participants.
* When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro:


### When the participant joins:

Validate the participant uses the VA Health and Benefits app and get permission for observers to join.



* Thanks so much for joining today. My name is __ very nice to meet you. Today we're going to talk about the VA mobile app. Our discussion will help the team understand how to improve the app for Veterans in the future. 
* Before we begin: I have a few people on the team who are interested in listening in to our session as observers. They’re in the virtual waiting room right now. It’s completely fine if you choose to have the session without observers, so let me know what you’d prefer. If it’s ok with you, I’ll have them join. 

_(If the participant agrees, let observers join with their video on. Each observer should come off mute and introduce themselves, and then go back on mute with video off.)_


## **Introduction (5 minutes)**



* There are a few things I'd like to mention:
    * There are no right or wrong answers, and I won’t be offended by any opinions you express. We just want to hear your opinions, so that we can improve the mobile app and make it work better for everyone.
    * There’s no expectation to provide any personal information. Please feel free to share your thoughts and experiences at the level that’s comfortable for you.
    * This entire session should take about 90 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
    * We’ll talk together in the beginning, and then we will move to a part where I’ll ask you to open the app on your mobile phone and share your phone screen with us. 
    * Finally, is it ok if I record the audio of our session today? Our team will use this as backup in case we need to refer to something you said. The recordings will be destroyed after.
    * **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. Any minutes you spend with us are valuable today. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop. Just let me know at any point if you’re uncomfortable continuing, and we will end.**
* Does that all make sense, and sound okay to you?
* Great! Any questions before we continue?
* Ok, I'm going to hit the record button now. 

_Start recording._



* Is it ok if we record this session?


## 
Section 1: Warm-Up Questions (5 minutes)**



* Before we look at the app, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.
* What VA services do you use?
    * How do you typically access those services? Website, phone call, something else?
    * Which VA tools are the most accessible? For example, do you find the website is best, MHV, the mobile app? Do you use certain VA tools to access some services and others for different services?
* Do you have the VA Health and Benefits mobile app?
    * If yes:
        * When did you first start using it?
        * What are the main reasons you use it?
        * How frequently do you go into the app? Daily? Weekly? Monthly?
    * If no: Move to next question
* How long have you been using assistive technology?
* What’s their experience generally working with the VA? How does the VA do, generally, with accessibility? Which VA tools are the most accessible? For example, do you find the website is best, MHV, the mobile app? Do you use certain VA tools to access some services and others for different services?
* Are there any digital interactions they’ve had with the VA that stand out (either positive or negative) that they could share?
* What are their common troubleshooting actions when working with the VA (if something goes awry, what types of things do they tend to try next)?


## **Section 2: App screen share (5 minutes)**



* During our session today, I am going to have you imagine a series of situations and I’d like you to use the app to work through them.
* First, I’d like to ask you to share your phone screen. I can walk you through how to start the screen share. \
