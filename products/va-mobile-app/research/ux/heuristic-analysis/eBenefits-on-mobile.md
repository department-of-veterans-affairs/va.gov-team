# eBenefits - Heuristic Analysis

This set of prompts (NN Group originals) can help us work together to look at a few different experiences with consistent language. The gist of the exercise to consider, and lightly document, the strong and weak examples of how these high-level principles play out in different “apps.”
Please include screenshots with short observations of why you feel they are good or bad examples of these principles.

## App Background
Original goal was to be a one stop shop for clinical and benefits information, created as part of ‘07 bill
Now, many of the features that eBenefits was built to have are being moved in phases to VA.gov 
The VA has 7 different benefit types and eBenefits in one place to apply and manage all of them
## Strive for consistency
### Does this experience feel like it is one thing, made by one team?
Yes for the most part - the majority of elements seem like they were made by one team but a few that seem like they were thrown on top (e.g., certain logos seem inconsistent and the fonts change in a few quirky places)
### Do patterns feel like they all came from the same set?
Sort of - the color palette seems inconsistent in some places (e.g., a banner in black in some places and a gray one in other places)
### Are controls in similar places, is behavior easy to predict?
Yes - there are two drop down menus at the top of the page, one for the main menu and dashboard
There is also a bottom section with key links that is consistent across pages 

## Keep users in control
### Do people feel like they are in charge, or the technology? Can they bail out of interactions whenever they want?
- For the most part the drop down menus up top make it clear how to get back to the main menu and navigate between pages
- The part that feels disjointed is being pushed to va.gov in certain spots
- This is unique to mobile, but several of the pages weren’t perfectly responsive, so it felt like a struggle to figure out what was on the entire page 


## Reduce users’ minimum steps
### How complex are interactions? How is the balance between the number of steps, and clarity of next action?

- Yes - navigating to the pages is straightforward, you select the drop down menu and then the page that you want to go to
- For more specific interactions, there might be more clicks involved because you have to do quite a bit of scrolling and clicking into things to confirm it is actually what you are looking for 

## Users should know where they are
### Is it easy to understand where to find things?

- Overall, yes, there are clear headings and menus that keep the user informed of where they are
- Though there is a lot of information on each page which can sometimes make it hard to remember what page your’re on given you have to scroll up to get to the heading

## Use plain language
### Clear labels, simple instructions, minimize jargon.

It is hard to know how familiar Vets are with benefits to begin with because if they aren’t familiar, then I would think there could be some confusion around the different claim types (eg, compensation, pension)
## Make the ui aesthetically appropriate
### Does the feel of the experience feel like it is tonally appropriate to its context?
- My context was unique because it was limited to mobile, which wasn’t the best; experience was not optimized for mobile (UI cut off, not responsive in some places)

## Present new information with meaningful aids to interpretation
### Does the experience scaffold new ideas for people?
