# Heuristic Analysis - MHV Mobile
## App Background
MHV provides health tools for managing healthcare: 
Pharmacy (prescription refill, tracking, medication history)
Appointments
Secure messaging
Health Records
It also has other features, including: 
Mental Health resources (screening tools, articles) 
Healthy Living (Healthe living assessment) 
Get Care (find caregivers, treatment facilities) 
Health tracking tools (Vitals, Labs + Tests, Journaling, goal setting)

## Strive for consistency
### Does this experience feel like it is one thing, made by one team? 
Mostly, yes. Similar to the VA.gov homepage, the MHV homepage has a bunch of links to big areas of the site, like Pharmacy, Appointments, Messages, etc and spotlit content. Some of the main resource links navigate away from MHV (Benefits and Health Library) to other places in a new tab (see below). As far as the pages on MHV, they generally seem to follow the same template. I haven’t yet found anything that feels hugely different. 
### Do patterns feel like they all came from the same set? 
Mostly, yes. Each big landing page (Pharmacy, Messages, Appointments, etc) uses the same navigation pattern to link to specific features within that area. All of the tables and other UI elements used to display information on detail pages feel consistent.  
### Are controls in similar places, is behavior easy to predict? 
Mostly, yes. The secondary navigation, in-page navigation, and page templates seem consistent. 


## Keep users in control
### Do people feel like they are in charge, or the technology? Can they bail out of interactions whenever they want? 
Yes. The site feels like a standard mobile site where users can press ‘back’, use the main navigation, or use in-page CTAs to move around.
## Reduce users’ minimum steps
### How complex are interactions? How is the balance between the number of steps, and clarity of next action? 
- I don’t think interactions are that complex, although there are lots of different types of CTAs. 
- Sophie: I think it depends what you are trying to on MHV - to get to the four landing pages, it is very clear. To get to a page on the side nav, it is somewhat clear but I got a little confused on the main page because I didn’t realize that “mental health” which appears in the side nav under “Research Health” was the same as the “mental health” that fell under the “Resources” on the main page. These types of inconsistencies and repetition of 
## Users should know where they are
### Is it easy to understand where to find things? 
- Kind of. There are UI mechanisms in place to help users get around and place themselves, however the overall IA of the site feels confusing at times. Here is a summary of some pros and cons that rose to the top when navigating MHV: 
- Pro: A secondary navigation pattern that lets users know where they are within a section and provides access to other content in the section. 
- Con: The overall IA feels confusing. The homepage offers four CTAs to Pharmacy, Appointments, Messages, and Health Records. However, the main navigation organizes things differently - for example, Appointments is nested under Get Care with items like Care Givers (keep track of all your healthcare providers in one convenient location), My Coverage (upload health insurance information), and Wellness Reminders (deprecated feature that used to provide preventative health reminders). The Personal Information section feels oddly titled too - seems like Settings or Account would be a better title. 
- Con: There is a breadcrumb navigation, but it isn’t mobile friendly because of truncation.
- Sophie: I had a really hard time navigating and knowing where I was. In part this was because I wasn’t sure whether to use the breadcrumb nav or the menu nav, or my phone nav. 
There is also some content, like the glossary, that was placed in what felt like a random spot, so I might have trouble navigating back to it. 









## Use plain language
### Clear labels, simple instructions, minimize jargon: Yes, MHV uses clear language. Here are some notable findings: 
When there is a task-oriented section of the site, they are generally labeled as such (e.g. Refill VA Prescriptions, VA Prescription Tracking, Track Health). However, there are other sections that don’t follow this pattern (e.g. Vitals, Labs + Tests, Appointments are sections in the navigation but it’s unclear quickly exactly what a user can do in those sections - upload, track, view, schedule?). I had to go to those pages and read carefully to understand what the features were.  
Short descriptions are present on tiled CTAs to give users context about a section’s purpose.
The clinical sections are very clear and to the point. 
 

## Make the ui aesthetically appropriate
### Does the feel of the experience feel like it is tonally appropriate to its context? Kind of. The site is responsive and works pretty well (I’m using iPhone 6), but there are some drawbacks: 
The top of each page includes standard VA site headers, the MHV site header, and a welcome bar with my profile name. It takes up a lot of real estate on mobile, maybe 30% of the screen height, and appears on every page. 
Some filtering and sorting buttons didn’t transition to mobile very well and take up lots of real estate and/or get separated from content in a way that it took me awhile to understand what they did.
 

## Present new information with meaningful aids to interpretation
### Does the experience scaffold new ideas for people? 
The experience itself seems super userful - being able to refill a prescription via mobile seems hugely valuable.
