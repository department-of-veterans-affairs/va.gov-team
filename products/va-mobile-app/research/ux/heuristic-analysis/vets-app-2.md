# Heuristic Analysis - VetsApp
## Technical Analysis
The VetsApp experience on iOS and Android is identical. Suspect a cross-platform hybrid approach is being used
A Push Notification was received on Monday April 27. Suspect a backend service is being used to deliver news updates. 
Through the app stores, found vetsapp.org and the vetsapp-news page. Most likely this is the source for push notifications. 
Developer/Owner is Jonathan Mills. More info about him and the app is here and here
This set of prompts (NN Group originals) can help us work together to look at a few different experiences with consistent language. The gist of the exercise to consider, and lightly document, the strong and weak examples of how these high-level principles play out in different “apps.”
Please include screenshots with short observations of why you feel they are good or bad examples of these principles.
## Strive for consistency
### Does this experience feel like it is one thing, made by one team? 
Yes, within the app the experience feels like it is made by one team
Linking out to other sites is when the experience ends though
Do patterns feel like they all came from the same set? 
On some pages, navigation is done by swiping whereas on other pages navigation is done my clicking buttons
These changes don’t necessarily feel inconsistent but I do think a navigation pattern that extended across the entire app would be easier to predict
Are controls in similar places, is behavior easy to predict? 
The back button appears on all pages that you can navigate to
The hamburger is on the homepage but not used on the landing pages

## Keep users in control
### Do people feel like they are in charge, or the technology? Can they bail out of interactions whenever they want?
Users have control within the app, but the control goes away when you leave the VetsApp b/c it feels like a decision you didn’t know you were making

## Reduce users’ minimum steps
### How complex are interactions? How is the balance between number of steps, and clarity of next action?
On the whole, yes - there is a home screen that takes the user to landing pages via one click
Two of the landing pages have swipe navigation though which doesn’t seem necessary and adds additional steps to what could otherwise be one page of links
There are also privacy notifications that are their own pages before a couple of the landing pages (eg, community, MyVA) and these don’t seem like they need to be their own pages 
## Users should know where they are
### Is it easy to understand where to find things?
The 6 landing pages are distinct but it isn’t immediately clear what will be contained in some of them like “community”
Once a user becomes familiar with the content of the app, then it is easier to know where you are and how to find things
It isn’t always clear when you are going to be punted to another website (eg, shopping discounts), so that can be a little confusing
## Use plain language
### Clear labels, simple instructions, minimize jargon.
Language is clear and easy to understand

## Make the ui aesthetically appropriate
### Does the feel of the experience feel like it is tonally appropriate to its context?
Branding feels appropriate
Some interactions, like swiping, don't seem like the most appropriate choice

## Present new information with meaningful aids to interpretation
### Does the experience scaffold new ideas for people?
Yes - there are unique features and ways of presenting information that is different than how it is typically presented on VA.gov
