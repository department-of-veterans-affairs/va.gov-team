**Unmoderated study reflection**

_Draft document 04/20/2021_

**Goal:**

The goal of this unmoderated A/B test was to determine if user’s expectations change when they see “MyHealtheVet” branding versus not. The decision to use an unmoderated study over interviews was based on the need for a speedy reply, and test a large group of participants, which would be difficult to achieve in interviews. 

**Set-up and requirements**



*   We used an unmoderated study in order to see the outcome of incorporating MHV branding on the secure messaging portion of the VA mobile app.
*   We were unable to create a survey due to restrictions from the Paper Reduction Act. We chose to create a card sort with a post-activity questionnaire. 
*   Cohorts can not be larger than 10 participants each, so we created 7 cohorts in order to get the volume of participants we needed. We were running an A/ B test, we had each cohort 50/50 split, which was 14 different studies. 
*   We used perigian’s [pre-screen form ](https://perigeantechnologies.knack.com/vausability-register-form)to choose the criteria for the cohorts. 
*   Each cohort needed to be distinguishable from another, so we used age groups in 10 year ranges. 
*   Each cohort needs to have a separate study and a unique link to the study. We launched the study and then copied the link to each study. (14 total)
*   We submitted the participant e-mail, research plan, and cohort list with unique links to the various studies. 

**Here is a list of items we created for the study:**



*   Research Plan
*   Optimal workshop card sort
*   Participant e-mail with code for thank you gift. 
*   Post-activity Questionnaire (including a place for participant to input code)
*   Synthesis and Research Report.

**Other notes:**



*   Optimal Workshop is not a first choice for accessibility.
