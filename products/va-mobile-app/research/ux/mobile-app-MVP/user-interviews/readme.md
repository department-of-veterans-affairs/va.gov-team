# Topline Summary of May 2020 Research Findings

**Key Research Questions**

1. What are all the ways Veterans manage their VA benefits (web sites, mobile apps, phone, in-person visits, VSO, etc.)?
2. What benefits or services are Veterans accessing (e.g. education, healthcare, disability)?
3. How do Veterans currently use their mobile devices?
4. What non-VA apps (non-social media apps) do they use the most? Why?
5. Do Veterans feel strongly about certain tasks being better for mobile or better for desktop for them? Why?
6. Where can a mobile app add unique value to VA’s technology offering (VA.gov et al)?
7. Refer back to Veteran’s experience with VA (benefits they access) and ask what pain points exist for them there? Do they think a mobile app could help?

1. **Relationships are important:** 5/10 participants discussed experience with a VSO, and a majority of participants cited a particular person as helpful in their interaction with VA (e.g. VIST-coordinator, health rep, local non-VA employee aides, counselor, MSA, VSO).

> "It comes down to the person you have to deal with...my coordinator is teriffic." -- P6

2. **A big pain points in interacting with VA online include sign in:** Several participants voiced that sign in to VA websites is a pain point for them, which echoes prior research into sign in at VA. Some voiced that the friction of sign in causes them to engage less with VA online, and some also noted that mobile apps outside VA generally provide an easier sign in for them.

> "I remember to refill my Rx while cooking dinner in the kitchen, and I put the phone on speaker to refill with VA...having to log on [to MHV on my phone] seems like more steps." -- P12

3. **Pain points in interacting with VA overall include inconsistency, needing to be persistent to access a benefit, lack of transparency, and confusion over benefits eligibility:** There can be lots of touchpoints a Veteran needs to interact with to complete a task and at times, it can feel like the onus is on the Veteran to develop an understanding of VA and be persistent until their need is met. Additionally, it can be frustrating to not know if something is moving forward or not, or know what steps to take to ensure that a request or question is indeed progressing. Generally, participants saw mobile as a way to remove some of these pain points by providing a quicker, easier way to interact with VA. 

> "Once [a request from Community Care] goes to the VA it goes into a black hole and can take awhile...Domino's has a pizza app, shows you that we got your order, pizza is out of the oven, pizza is ready for pickup. [I'd like that], but instead of pizza it is prescription or sign off from my doctor at VA." -- P5

4. **Attitude towards mobile is positive and participants were highly proficient in mobile:** All participants had a mobile device. Some older participants described themselves as not mobile proficient, yet went on to describe extensive and regular mobile device usage. We did not have any participants that voiced they would not want to interact with VA via mobile.

> “The Bank of America app meets all of my needs...very easy to use it from my phone. It’s a perfect example of how I’ve gotten away from laptop to use mobile.” -- P2

5. **The usefulness of a mobile app is determined by a Veteran’s context and needs:** When we asked participants about what apps they found useful, the consistent answer was the fact that the app is there and available when they need it. The same way that an app’s usefulness is determined by a need, a benefit of that app is being able to meet that need in the moment. Participants voiced that this reduces the burden on them to remember to do something when they got home and allows them to manage things on their terms.

> “My favorite app is tied to what I am trying to accomplish...Waze is the favorite when I get in the car, exercise is the favorite when I want to walk.” -- P2

6. **Mobile is particularly useful for starting and finishing quick, small tasks:** When asked to describe some scenarios of when they turn to their mobile phones, Veterans gave examples such as googling a word to find the definition, checking a bank balance, etc. The tasks that Veterans described showed the immediacy that can be present when turning to mobile.

> "I'm on my phone all the time anyway. Sometimes I think, 'oh I need to refill my meds!' If it is 9 PM, I could hop on a phone and know that if I click this button, this will happen." -- P0

7. **Prolonged or input heavy scenarios are better for desktop:** When asked to describe some scenarios where they would not turn to mobile, participants cited a couple things. First, input heavy scenarios such as filling out a long form. The reason given for this was usability concerns rather than lack of desire to be able to do this on mobile. Second, longer tasks were consistently cited as better for desktop. One participant described “longer” as upwards of 15 minutes, but that definition can vary from person to person and task to task.

> “I wouldn’t fill out my car loan but I would pay my car bill through a phone app.” -- P11

8. **General reaction to VA mobile app was positive, and the most requested features were healthcare, updates, and connection to people at VA:** Participants voiced that they could see an app playing a role in managing their healthcare with VA by an app surfacing My HealtheVet features, managing their ability to check-in with VA faster and more easily than they can today, and improve their communication with VA and better put them in touch with people at VA who can help them.

> "If I get to the point where I have a medical appt, under VHA, I would think it would be extremely helpful to manage that info in a mobile device." -- P2
> "[I'd like to be] kept in the loop 24/7." -- P5
