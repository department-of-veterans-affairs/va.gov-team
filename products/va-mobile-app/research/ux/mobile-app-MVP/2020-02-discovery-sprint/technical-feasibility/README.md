# Purpose

To explore the question of how the VA could build a flagship mobile app, we conducted *Technical Feasibility* reserach. This research included evaluating mobile app frameworks and approaches as well as research into what it would take to get logon implemneted on a mobile phone. 

## Research
Our initial discovery into *Technical Feasibility* was broken out into two phases:
- **Phase 1:** Evaluation
- **Phase 2:** Experimentation


## Timeline: 

- **Evaluate Approaches and Frameworks:** Feb 28 - March 9, 2020
- **Experiment with Approachces and Frameworks:** March 9 - March 20, 2020
- **Recommend Framework to Validate Further:** March 23 - April, 2010

## Outcome

At the end of the discovery sprint, we had three bets about how the VA could build a mobile app:
1. **Framework:** React Native provides the best balance between organizational viability and technical feasibility
2. **Login:** Login can be accomplished by enabling the VA.gov-centric part of vets-api to accept OAuth
3. **vets-api:** Versioning the existing vets-api is the most sustainable strategy to ensure reuse by mobile clients

The next step is to validate these bets. See: [research/engineering](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/va-mobile-app/research/engineering)
