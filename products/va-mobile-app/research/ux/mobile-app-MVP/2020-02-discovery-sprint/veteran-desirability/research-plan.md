# Background
We are exploring how best to provide mobile device access to VA services and information. The guiding questions we are working towards to answer are: 
- Why should the VA build a mobile app? What problem for VA beneficiaries does it solve that VA.gov or existing apps don't solve?
- What features should a VA mobile app include? What features do Veterans prioritize and need in a VA mobile app?

We are starting research to collect Veteran perspectives on what they need from VA. Veteran insights will help us uncover key questions that we can use to guide the technical discovery being done by our team across the full spectrum of approaches. We are taking a two phased approach outlined below.

## Phase One
### Research questions
The goal of this phase is to help us determine what feature set Veterans most desire in a VA mobile application. Here are some of the questions that we will answer during this initial phase:
Feature set: What feature set do Veterans need on a mobile application with VA? 
How do they prioritize that feature set?
### Method: Card sorting
We will use remote card sorting to quickly understand from each Veteran how they would think about VA mobile features, prioritize and categorize them in a way that makes the most sense to them.
The team will use Optimal Workshop to perform these exercises remotely, collect the data from each participant and use that insight to inform Phase Two. The priorities we uncover here will help us shape the technical discovery and set the stage for usability style research to come.

### Method approach and participant criteria
We will be performing an unmoderated card sorting activity so that we can quickly collect feedback from at least 25 Veterans. Screener, pre and post questions will be included to help us accurately analyze the collected data. We will ask for help from internal team members (as well as VA stakeholders) to get this study in front of their networks. Below is content you can post or email to Veterans:
Hello! A team I’m working with at the Department of Veterans Affairs is looking for Veterans to participate in a quick (10-15 minutes) study for us to learn what their needs are when leveraging VA services on their mobile devices. It’s an easy to follow activity that you can do from any computer. Here is a link to use and get started:

Please feel free to share this link with your Veteran networks, as we are aiming to gather as much feedback as possible.
We thank you for your help improving how VA serves Veterans!
### Participant criteria for this study:
- All participants are Veterans.
- All participants have had interactions with online services at VA.
- At least 25 participants who have completed 100% of the card sort.
### Schedule
- February 28: Schedule and confirm Veteran interviews days/times.
- March 2: Complete Phase One research plan.
- March 3: Phase One research plan approved.
- March 4: Prepare Optimal Workshop card sorting activity, review Veteran interview guidelines with internal (Ad Hoc) team members, test run of activity.
- March 5: Publish card sort activity and share with Veterans.
- March 6: Debrief with VA stakeholders current status of card sort study.
- March 9: Close card sort study.
### Team Roles
- Testing and planning facilitation: Julia Elman (julia@adhocteam.us)
- Research guide writing and task development: Jonathan Julian (jonathan@adhocteam.us), Julia Elman (julia@adhocteam.us), Sophie Myers (sophia.myers@adhocteam.us)
### Deliverables
### The deliverables for Phase One are:
- Recommendations for Phase Two prototype.
- Data analysis of the card sorting tasks.
- Raw response data from pre and post task questions.
## Phase Two
### Research questions
The goal of this phase of the research is to take our learning with Veterans to build a testable prototype of a proposed VA mobile application that best meets their needs when interacting at VA. Here are some of the questions that we will answer during this second phase:
What are Veterans expecting to see when they initially log on to a VA mobile application? Are the features that we included meeting their needs when interacting with VA? If not, what is missing? What can be improved?
What is the most important secondary action that a Veteran would do want to when leveraging VA mobile?
### Methods: Usability testing, Affinity diagramming
With a clearer idea in mind of what features Veterans need from a VA mobile application and how they prioritize them, we will be better equipped to develop a clickable prototype for our team to test with. This study will help to inform an initial vision for VA mobile and the direction we take in creating a world class mobile experience for Veterans.
After we have our initial notes and results from usability testing, we will perform a remote affinity diagramming activity with our VA partners to collectively determine the outcomes from our study. This method is a great way for our team to come to a Veteran-centered consensus of what next steps should be for VA mobile.
#### What is usability testing?
In a usability-testing session, a researcher (called a “facilitator” or a “moderator”) asks a participant to perform tasks, usually using one or more specific user interfaces. While the participant completes each task, the researcher observes the participant’s behavior and listens for feedback. Learn more about the practice of usability testing here: https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-testing-101/ 
#### What is affinity diagramming?
Affinity diagramming is a method that helps teams collaboratively analyze research findings as well as ideas from ideation sessions. Learn more about the practice of affinity diagramming here: https://www.nngroup.com/articles/affinity-diagram/ 
### Participants
Below is the participant criteria we are looking for in this second phase of our study:
- Representing all branches of the Armed Forces
- Equal distribution of gender
- At least one person in each of the following age brackets: 18-30, 31-50, 50+.  
- 3 - 4 Veteran participants
- All participants are familiar with using VA online services
### Schedule
NOTE: This schedule may change due to the availability of the participants and flexibility of schedules.
- March 5: Start recruiting and scheduling participants for the week of March 16th.
- March 12 - 16: Finalize Phase Two research plan and conversation guide based on Phase One results, create and finalize clickable prototypes for usability testing.
- March 16 - 23: Perform usability testing with participants.
- March 24 - 30: Team (Ad Hoc + VA Stakeholders) synthesis of results from both Phase One and Two research, write final report and create slide deck with final recommendations.
- April 1 (or 2nd?): Present results to VA stakeholders.
