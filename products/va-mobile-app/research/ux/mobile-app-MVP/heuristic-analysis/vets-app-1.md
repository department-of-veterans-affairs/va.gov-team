# Heuristic Analysis Template
This set of prompts (NN Group originals) can help us work together to look at a few different experiences with consistent language. The gist of the exercise to consider, and lightly document, the strong and weak examples of how these high-level principles play out in different “apps.”
Please include screenshots with short observations of why you feel they are good or bad examples of these principles.

## App Background
VetsApp is an app developed by a 3rd party that organizes--on one screen--many of the benefits available to all veterans, as well as tools to connect with fellow veterans near them. According to the Apple App Store description - “VetsApp is a community” and does not store, record, or monitor any information exchanged between this app and secure websites.
VetsApp is available in both the Apple App Store (for iPhone and iPad) and Google Play Store. 
App functionality includes:
| Apple App Store  - Average Rating 4.7 / 5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Google Play Store - Average Rate: 4.4 / 5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

## Strive for consistency
### Does this experience feel like it is one thing, made by one team? Do patterns feel like they all came from the same set? Are controls in similar places, is behavior easy to predict? 
Both versions of the app have the same look and feel. For the app itself, the patterns are fairly consistent.
However, navigation appears to be easier with the Android version.
Due to heavy reliance on pages from the different sites, there is lack of consistency across the different sites (va.gov vs. military.com)
Site structure and navigation differ by grouping (e.g. Jobs vs. News)


## Keep users in control
### Do people feel like they are in charge, or the technology? Can they bail out of interactions whenever they want?
Both versions of the app send users to web pages where the areas of interest are. The app uses several different sites, including VA.gov, usajobs.gov, archives.gov (to request military service records), etc, it takes you away from the app. If you would like to go back to the app, it is a little difficult to navigate back to the app with the iOS version vs. the Android version.
Due to heavy reliance on web pages from the different sites, the interactions are as good as the websites.




## Reduce users’ minimum steps
### How complex are interactions? How is the balance between number of steps, and clarity of next action?
Some options are organized better than others. For example, Jobs requires lots of swiping to see the options since there are not all on one screen. 
- MyVA - menu on one screen
- Jobs - requires swiping three screens to see the options
- News  - on all one screen





## Users should know where they are
### Is it easy to understand where to find things?
Most of the time, it is clear where to find things.
Easy to differentiate the different sites by the look and feel.
However,
It is not immediately clear that applying for a Veteran ID Card is under Discounts
Terminology used is inconsistent - Jobs vs. Employment
“Managing Claims and Appeals” are separate than “Managing My Benefits”
## Use plain language
### Clear labels, simple instructions, minimize jargon.
Labels are clear and simple

## Make the ui aesthetically appropriate
### Does the feel of the experience feel like it is tonally appropriate to its context?
The look and feel is appropriate but does feel disjointed due to leveraging multiple websites.
Due to how the advertising is displayed and that it can be accidently selected, the experience can be distracting and disrupting.

## Present new information with meaningful aids to interpretation
### Does the experience scaffold new ideas for people?
Very website dependent
