## Qualitative Ratings Callouts

### ChampVAPay
Google Play:
- Being trained in coding makes it very easy to navigate this app.
- Just like many VA items, this app is pointless.
- Whats the purpose of knowing if Champva covers a procedure? Are you going to ask thr doctor to wait while you check each code beforehand?

### RX Refill
App Store:
- When I first tried the app a few weeks ago it worked great. I was impressed at the ease of refilling my meds. No more long phone tree and typing in numbers. But now I have to downgrade my score because for several days now the app isn't working. I am surprised at the quick downfall of something that worked so well many times is now a failure. I can log on but get the red screen that "not all features are functioning" which translates to nothing is functioning. Too bad
Google Play:
- This app is excellent in that it is straight forward, easy to understand and very simple and uncomplicated to use. Cannot ask for more than that. I might add that, most importantly, it works seamlessly.

### VetsApp
App Store:
- I truly like to use this App for a number of reasons. Generally, it is not easy get CBOC on the phone, but I can write a SECURE MESSAGE & get a response back with-in 20 minutes!!!
