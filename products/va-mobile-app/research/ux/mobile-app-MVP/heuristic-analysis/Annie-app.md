# Annie App - Heuristic Analysis 
This set of prompts (NN Group originals) can help us work together to look at a few different experiences with consistent language. The gist of the exercise to consider, and lightly document, the strong and weak examples of how these high-level principles play out in different “apps.”
Please include screenshots with short observations of why you feel they are good or bad examples of these principles.
## App Background
“Annie is a VA service that sends automated text messages to Veterans to help them stay focused on their self-care,” per mobile.va.gov 
The goal is keep Veterans engaged and working towards their health goals in between appointments
VA Care professionals cannot respond to messages that are sent through the Annie app and they aren’t guaranteed to be read either

## Strive for consistency
### Does this experience feel like it is one thing, made by one team? 
No - the branding on the first page is different than the branding that we see on the modals
The first page feels young and fun whereas the modals, especially the About modal, looks more traditional and stuffy
The About modal also has the VA logo at the top of it - but this logo isn’t anywhere else in the app

### Do patterns feel like they all came from the same set? 
Sort of, the navigation is very simple. There is a navigation bar across the top of the page and it stays the same throughout. 
Modals pop up when you select an option from the navigation bar, which is consistent (though unexpected and clunky-feeling)
### Are controls in similar places, is behavior easy to predict? 
The controls are in the same place but the modal really threw me off even though it happens for each of the controls - modals on mobile maybe aren’t so common?

## Keep users in control
### Do people feel like they are in charge, or the technology? Can they bail out of interactions whenever they want?
Meh… I felt a bit trapped in the technology. Like, yes, I was able to select different options on the navigation but I was sent directly to a modal which was limiting and didn’t always provide the information I expected or needed
Also the hamburger at the top of the page on the right doesn't behave the way that a hamburger usually does. When you click it the 3 options: About, Options and Logout appear on the left of the screen
There is a message at the bottom of the app that says you can send messages and then refresh your screen to see them appear; this didn’t happen when I refreshed and generally speaking, the instructions weren’t particularly user friendly 

Reduce users’ minimum steps
How complex are interactions? How is the balance between number of steps, and clarity of next action?
Actually getting to the app took quite a while. I’m still confused about how users would get to it on a regular basis - do you have to go to mobile.va.gov and start from there each time?
There aren’t many steps once you are in the app given the messaging box is at the bottom of the first page

## Users should know where they are
### Is it easy to understand where to find things?
Yes, it is easy to understand where to find each of the landing pages
The way the information is provided in a modal is unexpected though
Also the way that the information is formatted (a mix of bullets and some bolding) makes it harder to follow
## Use plain language
### Clear labels, simple instructions, minimize jargon.
Labels are mostly clear (eg, send, view schedule, about)
There isn’t jargon
The instructions are not simple. In particular there is an instruction to refresh the browser when you send a message
There is also language such as “readings” which aren’t entirely clear


## Make the ui aesthetically appropriate
### Does the feel of the experience feel like it is tonally appropriate to its context?
The annie logo threw me off at first - I wasn’t sure what the dot on the ‘i’ was initially 
The color palette also feels off brand for the VA as well as the logo’s font
The blurb about Annie and her picture also feels very inconsistent with the UI; I would expect the branding to be more traditional given her picture


## Present new information with meaningful aids to interpretation
### Does the experience scaffold new ideas for people?
No
