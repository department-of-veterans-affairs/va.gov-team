# Discussion Guide for Mobile App Prototype Testing

June 2, 2020

# Introduction (5 minutes)
Thank you for joining us today. My name is Bridget and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes.
**VA is considering building a mobile app.**  I am working with the VA to explore what features should be in a mobile app to best serve and meet the needs of Veterans. Today, I’d like to: 
- First, do an interactive exercise where you tell me what the most useful things for you would be in a VA mobile app. I’ll share my screen with you and drive the mouse, and you will direct me on what to do. 
- Second, show you a prototype for a mobile app and get your feedback. At this point, I’ll send you a link in the Zoom chat and ask you to share your screen with me and look at some screens.



Before we start, there are a few things I want to mention:
- Our conversation should take 45 minutes--1 hour.
- In our conversation today, we want to hear your honest opinions. My team’s goal is to improve VA digital tools to better meet the needs of Veterans like you. I will not be offended by any opinions you express - please be as honest as you feel comfortable being with me today.
- Lastly, if it’s alright with you, I would like to record our conversation. We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are deleted after we complete analysis, and won’t be used for anything other than internal research purposes. Are you comfortable if I record the screen and audio?
  - If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

Those are all the logistics I wanted to share. Do you have any questions for me before we get started?

# Warm Up (3 minutes)
First I’d love to want to learn more about your experience with VA.
- Can you tell me about the last time you used VA.gov?
  - What did you do? Was that a typical visit for you? 
 
- Do you use VA healthcare? 
  - Can you tell me about the last time you used MHV? 
    - What did you do? Was that a typical visit for you?

- Have you filed a claim with VA?
  - Can you tell me about the last time you logged into eBenefits?
    - What did you do? Was that a typical visit for you?

Thank you for sharing all that.

# Co-design (25 minutes)

## Instructions (2 minutes)
Let’s jump into the first portion of our conversation. [Share screen]. I want to tell you a bit about what you see here:
1. This is your VA mobile app home screen, where you can see a welcome message from VA, and a link to the Veteran Crisis Line. So let’s imagine you arrive here after logging in, and this is the home screen of your VA mobile app. 
2. On the right hand side, there are some empty sticky notes, which I can fill out, with you telling me what to write. 
3. Once you have added ideas for things you want in your VA app, I can drag them over here, and later on you can tell me how to rearrange them.

Does that sound good?

I want to understand from you what you would include first in a VA mobile app if you could build your ideal VA mobile app. **Specifically, if you had to start small with an app that can only do some things, what are the most important things for you?**

## Participant driven adding (10 minutes)
Ok, let’s add! 
- What is the first thing you would like to add?
  - Why would you add this? 
  - Can you describe the value having this in an app would bring to you?
- (Repeat as often as needed) What is the next thing you would add? 
  - Why would you add this? 
  - Can you describe the value having this in an app would bring to you?

## Predetermined feature adding (10 minutes)
Now I want to show you some ideas we have for a VA mobile app. Please take some time to read through and then we’ll keep adding. Feel free to ignore anything that is already in your app. My question for you is: **if you could add anything from what you see here, what’s the first thing you would add?**

### General follow up questions for all predefined features
- Why would you add this?
  - In your words, what’s the value of this thing to you? 
- When would this be useful to you?
- How often do you think you’d use this in an app?
- How would this change/have changed your claims experience at VA?
- How would this change/have changed your health experience at VA?

### Feature specific follow up questions
- **Check the status of your VA claim or appeal**
  - What does “status” mean to you?
  - When you have an active claim, how often do you check the status?
  - If you could check the status in an app, how often would you check the status?
- **Take a photo of a file with your phone and upload to your VA claim or appeal**
  - Have you ever needed to submit additional documents to a claim after you filed it?

- **View and edit your VA.gov profile**
  - Is editing important here?
  - What types of information would be important to edit?

## Wrap Up (5 minutes)
Let's look at the whole thing you've built and prioritize. If you had to prioritize the most important and useful things to you in this app...
- What’s #1 most useful?
  - Why?
- What’s #2 most useful?
  - Why?
- What’s #3 most useful?
  - Why?
- Let's imagine again you are talking to a friend who is also a Veteran about the app you've built and you’re telling them about it. What would you say about it?
- How does the app you built compare to how you interact with VA online today?

# Prototype (10 minutes)
Now I’d like to show you an interactive prototype that I built and see what you think about it.  I am sending a link in the Zoom chat, can you click on it and share your screen? 

We started small with an app that can only do a couple things that we thought might be useful and important. Now that you’ve had a chance to share with us what is most critical for you, I’d like to share the work-in-progress prototype of some ideas we are thinking about including, and see what you think. Does that sound good?

What I’d like you to do is navigate freely -- click as much as you want, you can choose where we go here. Please click **Start** to begin.

## App exploration (5 minutes)
I'll give you a couple minutes to explore. 
- What do you think? 
- Would what you see here in this app be useful to you? 
  - Why or why not?
- Is there anything here that definitely _wouldn't_ be useful to you?
  - Why?
- How would this change your experience with VA?
- _Probe towards a specific section of the app: Please navigate to the [title] section of the app._

## Prototype wrap up (5 minutes)
- Imagine you are talking to a friend who is also a Veteran and telling them about this app. What would you say?
- How does this app compare to how you interact with VA online today?
- **Would you download this app?**
  - **If not, what would need to add from your app to push it over the line for you?**
- How would you expect to learn about an app from VA?

# Session wrap up (2 minutes)
That’s all the questions I have for you today. Do you have any last questions for me?

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on VA digital tools and make sure it really works for Veterans like you. Enjoy the rest of your day!
