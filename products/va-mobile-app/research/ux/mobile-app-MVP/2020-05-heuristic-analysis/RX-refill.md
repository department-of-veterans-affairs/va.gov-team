# Rx Refill – Heuristic Analysis
This set of prompts (NN Group originals) can help us work together to look at a few different experiences with consistent language. The gist of the exercise to consider, and lightly document, the strong and weak examples of how these high-level principles play out in different “apps.”
Please include screenshots with short observations of why you feel they are good or bad examples of these principles.
## App Background
Rx Refill is an app that allows Vets to “Request, refill and track VA prescriptions with ease,” per the mobile.va.gov website
Refills and prescription history are limited to VA-issued prescriptions
This app provides the same feature as the one prescription refill feature available on MHV
Prescriptions are then refilled via a “VA Mail Order Pharmacy”
The app assumes the user has at least some familiarity w/ MHV 

## Strive for consistency
### Does this experience feel like it is one thing, made by one team? 
Yes, there is design consistency throughout the app as far as colors, fonts and reuse of the same vocabulary (e.g., prescriptions are referred to the same way throughout)
The login experience was clearly not made by the same team and didn’t necessarily feel inconsistent, it just felt distinct - but because the app’s header navigation was still there on the in-app browser pages, it didn’t throw me off 

### Do patterns feel like they all came from the same set? 
Yes, there are four main pages that the user accesses by selecting an option from the main page of the app


### Are controls in similar places, is behavior easy to predict? 
Sort of, the navigation at the top of the page is very simple and is used on most pages. However, on some pages the hamburger menu on the right side does not appear whereas on other pages it does. The back arrow that brings you to the apps “homepage” is on every page. 


## Keep users in control
### Do people feel like they are in charge, or the technology? Can they bail out of interactions whenever they want?
On the whole, yes, users can bail out of interactions and get back to the main page where they can navigate to the other pages
The part of the process where technology felt like it was in control was the login experience. The pages were slow to load and the buttons didn’t always work on the redirect page.

## Reduce users’ minimum steps
### How complex are interactions? How is the balance between number of steps, and clarity of next action?
Mostly yes - there is very simple navigation from the main page to the four other pages. It is a simple one click to get to each one. 

## Users should know where they are
### Is it easy to understand where to find things?
There isn’t very much that the user can do, so it is obvious where you are in the app
The main page is the jumping off point so the flow is pretty much going back and forth from that page

## Use plain language
### Clear labels, simple instructions, minimize jargon.
Labels on the main page were clear and simple
There was some jargon however that wasn’t immediately clear to me on the “Medication Information from My HealthEVet” page such as blue button download 
The app also assumes that the viewer knows what MHV is and referred to differently throughout the app (MHV vs My HealthEVet)


## Make the ui aesthetically appropriate
### Does the feel of the experience feel like it is tonally appropriate to its context?
The initial color palette seems a bit off on the first page. I would expect a pharmacy app to be more subdued whereas this menu felt pretty lively. 
The four landing pages are subdued however and feel appropriate. 

## Present new information with meaningful aids to interpretation
### Does the experience scaffold new ideas for people?
It’s hard to say whether this information is new to people; I would imagine they already know most of this information however the ability to order the prescriptions online is new and the way that is presented to them is fairly intuitive. There isn’t a lot that can be done in this app, so the ordering flow is easy to follow.
