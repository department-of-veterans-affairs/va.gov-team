## Heuristic Analysis Template

This set of prompts (NN Group originals) can help us work together to look at a few different experiences with consistent language. The gist of the exercise to consider, and lightly document, the strong and weak examples of how these high-level principles play out in different “apps.”
Please include screenshots with short observations of why you feel they are good or bad examples of these principles.

### Strive for consistency
Does this experience feel like it is one thing, made by one team? Do patterns feel like they all came from the same set? Are controls in similar places, is behavior easy to predict? 

### Keep users in control
Do people feel like they are in charge, or the technology? Can they bail out of interactions whenever they want?

### Reduce users’ minimum steps
How complex are interactions? How is the balance between number of steps, and clarity of next action?

### Users should know where they are
Is it easy to understand where to find things?

### Use plain language
Clear labels, simple instructions, minimize jargon.

### Make the ui aesthetically appropriate
Does the feel of the experience feel like it is tonally appropriate to its context?

### Present new information with meaningful aids to interpretation
Does the experience scaffold new ideas for people?
