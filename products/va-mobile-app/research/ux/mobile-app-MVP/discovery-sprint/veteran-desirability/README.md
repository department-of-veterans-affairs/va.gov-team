# Purpose

To explore the question of whether the VA should have a flagship mobile app, we must first understand if Veterans desire one. Our *Veteran Desirability* reserach is focused on understanding pain points of Veterans how they might be solved using a mobile app. 

## Research
Our initial discovery into *Veteran Desirability* consisted of two activites broken into two phases: 
- **Phase one:** [Card sorting](card-sorting)
- **Phase two:** [Usability testing](usability-testing)

## Timeline: 

- **Phase one:** Feb 28 - March 9, 2020
- **Phase two:** March 9 - March 30, 2020

## Outcome

At the end of the discovery sprint, we had two bets about what Veterans desire in a VA mobile app:
1. **Features:** Authenticated features are more valuable to Veterans than unauthenticated features.
2. **Added Value:** A mobile application provides more value to Veterans than a mobile VA.gov experience because of native features like biometric login, camera and GPS.

The next step is to validate these bets. See: [research/ux](research/ux)
