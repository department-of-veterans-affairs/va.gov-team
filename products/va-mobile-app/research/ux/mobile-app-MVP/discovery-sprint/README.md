# Background
In late February of 2020, a four-week discovery sprint kicked off to explore our three guiding questions about whether and how the VA should build a mobile app. 

1. **Why** should VA build a mobile app? (What problem for VA beneficiaries does a mobile app solve that VA.gov and existing apps don't solve?)
2. **What** features should a VA mobile app include? (What features do Veterans prioritize and need in a VA mobile app?)
3. **How** should a VA mobile app be built? (What framework and technical approach should the mobile app use?)

The questions of **what** the VA would build and **why** the VA should build a mobile app focused on *Veteran Desirability* and user research to determine whether Veterans would actually want or use an app. 

The question of **how** the VA should build a mobile app focused on *Technical Feasibility* research and experimentation to determine how the VA could build an app given the systems and technologies that exist at VA today.
