# VA Mobile App Prototype Testing + Co-design Research Summary



June 12, 2020



## Background and goals

Two discovery sprints were done from March to May 2020 to understand Veteran desirability for a VA mobile app. 

In the March 2020 discovery sprint ([view research summary](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/research/ux/mobile-app-MVP/2020-02-discovery-sprint/veteran-desirability/usability-testing/VA%20Mobile%20App%20Discovery_%20Usability%20test%20report.pdf)) two bets were made by the team. First, that authenticated features are more valuable to Veterans than unauthenticated features. Second, that a mobile application provides more value to Veterans than a mobile VA.gov experience. In the May 2020 discovery effort ([view research summary](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/research/ux/mobile-app-MVP/2020-05-user-interviews/research-summary.md)),  the team focused on learning about Veteran interactions with VA, pain points, mobile behaviors, and desire for a VA mobile app. 

Using insights from these prior studies, the June 8-10, 2020 research sessions focused on:  

1. **A co-design 'Build Your VA Mobile App' exercise** to understand, in a Veteran's own words, what they would like in a mobile app. The goal of this was to help refine the living roadmap, MVP features, and plan for future testing.

2. **A limited interactive prototype** to test the usefulness of a limited app, validate or challenge our hypothesis about what features should be in the MVP, and understand if Veterans would download a limited app.

## Research Question 1

_Is our hypothesis right that limited Claims and Health features plus some standard mobile features (e.g. notifications, notification settings, profile, biometric sign in) are the right places to start for the MVP?_

### Yes, claims and health seem like the right places to start

During co-design, claims and health features were added by all participants. The co-design exercise began with participants being asked to communicate their own feature ideas from scratch, and then allowed them to add features from a pre-defined set. During both portions, claims and/or health were cited by all participants. In prototype testing, participants responded well to health and claim features as represented in the low-fi prototype. Below is a summary of how specific health and claims features ranked in co-design: 

### Health features are highly useful. Appointments, Secure Messaging, and Rx refill are the most useful health features.

1. **Appointments** was added by 7 (all) participants and cited as a top priority by 4 participants. While participants talked about wanting to schedule and manage appointments, getting reminders about VA appointments was also specifically requested and mentioned by multiple participants. Participants said appointments are useful in an app so it's easier to keep track of when they're supposed to go into VA and more easily manage the appointments they have.

   - "Appointments - check to see when your appointments are and if you need to reschedule...if you can't make it, let someone else be able to" -- P1 (freeform)
   - "'VA appointments' and giving you reminders - giving you reminders about appointments would be huge." -- P5 (predefined)
   - "[Speaking about the value of appointment reminders] - I barely remember I had this meeting. I get out of work and I go braindead. I don't use the computer a lot at home if I can help it. Phone or tablet is main way I access internet at home." -- P3 (predefined)
   - Two participants voiced that they would like to see their VA appointments integrate into their existing calendar:
      - "If you had a little button, transfer this info to google calendar that would be awesome. I use google calendar 20, 30, 40x a day." -- P6 (predefined)

2. **Secure Messaging** was added by 5 participants and cited as a top priority by 1 participant. Participants said Secure Messaging was useful in an app because they use it a lot today, and would value being able to more quickly have a direct line to their provider for when they need to ask a question, request more Rx refills, etc. 

   - "[The first thing I would add is] Secure Messaging - it's hard to quantify [why this is valuable] because it can be used on phone today [using MHV] - but if you didn't have to log in every time that would be helpful." -- P4 (freeform)
   - "Secure Messaging. If I'm out of refills I have to send a message to doc to reup refills - if I could do it in an app, it would be something I wouldn't have to remember to do when I got back home to my computer." -- P6 (predefined)


3. **Rx Refills** was added by 3 participants and cited as a top priority by 3 participants. Participants said Rx Refill would be useful in an app because it's a task that regularly needs to be done, and being able to do it faster via an app rather than a computer. 

   - "[The first thing I would add is] being able to refill medications - I have 7-8 different bottles coming at 7-8 different times a month." -- P6 (freeform)
   - "I would like my meds to be automatically refilled for me but if not, just click a button. If [the app] needs to ask a doc, ask a doc. I just want to click a button." -- Pilot participant (freeform)
   - "[The value is] going on your phone and see what you're supposed to order rather than get out your laptop and log in. I have my phone with me all the time." -- P4 (freeform)

     

### Health Record and Labs + Tests are somewhat useful health features

1. **Health Record** was added by 3 participants and cited as a top priority by 1 participant

   - "I would add 'Your Health Record' so I could use it at fast pace, like in the emergency room. Local hospitals don't have your VA records." -- P1 (predefined)

2. **Labs + Tests** was added by 2 participants and cited as a top priority by no participants

   - "I would add 'Your Labs + Tests' because sometimes it can take ~3 months to get back into the doctor to get lab results" -- P4 (predefined)



### Claims features are highly useful. Checking a claim's status and direct access to claims support through an app are highly useful.

1. **Checking the status of a claim** was added by 4 participants and cited as a top priority by 2 participants. Seeing if/how a claim is progressing was cited as a pain point by the participants who were in process of a claim and the decision is important because it determines benefits a Veteran can access. Participants said keeping tabs on a claim's status in an app is useful because they frequently check and would value being able to do it faster and more easily.  

   - "Claims - like to see who has it, like to see if there was any progress of it was just collecting dust. There's no accountability period when it comes to a claim." -- P6 (freeform)
   - "I'd add 'check the status of your VA claim or appeal', because [a claims decision] opens up a lot of avenues depending on the decision that deciders give to you." -- P4 (predefined)
   - In prototype testing, the additional evidence tag on the claims detail page tested well, indicating that the claims detail view is most valuable when it shows a comprehensive view of all actions that need to be taken if there is anything a       Veteran needs to do in order for their claim status to move forward.
      - "[Status of a claim] is a big stressor - you dont know where you are in the process, hard to know what step you are on. I just want to see where I am and what else I have to do." -- P3 (predefined)


2. **Chatting with a VA representative in claims** was added by 3 participants and cited as a top priority by 1 participant. Direct contact with VA was a common theme throughout sessions (see research question 4), and mentioned specifically in relation to claims by about half of participants. Participants said claims support chat in an app is useful because it would saving time from having to track information from VA via phone and bring more transparency to a frustrating process.

   -  "Chat with VA Claims Support - I'd want to chat with whoever is taking in the forms, it seems like such a blackhole..I just don't get a lot of feedback." -- P3 (predefined)
   - "Chatting [with VA Claims] is #1 - it's easier to ask a quick question on an app then call and sit on the line and wait." -- P2 (freeform)
 
     

### Uploading a file to a claim is somewhat useful and it's most useful to send in a few files only, not a lot of files

1. **Uploading a file to a claim** was added by 2 participants and not cited as a top priority by any participants in co-design. Although this feature did not rise to the top in co-design, it tested well in prototype testing and was seen as a time saver, especially a time saver that might save additional trips to a VA facility for documents.

   - "I like the ability to easily send in a doc - it was a pretty decent drive [to VA to sort out claims documents]." -- P3 
   - "This would allow you to take a picture of the document if you’ve got it. That’s good. Today you have to go to your VSO and ask them to take a picture and send it in, that way it’s right there so you can do it yourself." -- P1 
   - "This is great. I wouldn't want to do my medical record, that is for sure. But DD-214 or one doc appointment, that wouldn't be too bad." -- P3 


### Aside from these findings, there are two more points worth mentioning about claims:
- First, during the freeform portion of co-design, P2 described getting letters from VA in the mail that did not match with the claims status she was seeing online: 
   - "[The first thing I'd add is] being able to see the accurate status of a claim. Status + other information isn't always updated on [VA.gov] - status is only helpful if it's right." 
- Second, during prototype testing P5 voiced a desire to see as much transparency as possible with every aspect of the claims features in our prototype:
   - "After you upload a document to a claim, have it show up in details where it says 'View Evidence' - like 'DD214 uploaded via mobile'. Having a notification feature would be really useful...getting a notification saying you succesfully uploaded your DD214, notification saying you need to schedule a C+P exam, etc." 

**Both of these points indicate the app may want to lean into transparency as much as possible with claims, with things like:**
   - Time stamp of the last time a claim status was updated
   - Time stamp for when a claim detail screen was last refreshed
   - Encouraging messge (e.g. 'You are all caught up, we will notify you as soon as something changes') if the user refreshes the page multiple times in one visit
   - Pending state for any documents uploaded through the app to clarify that an uploaded file has been received and is being processed
   - As many notifications about changes to a claim that we can provide

**Lastly, 1 participant voiced concerns over taking photos of and sharing documents such as DD-214:**
   - "[Docs I need to upload] usually have SSN, address, they're not something I am going to take a picture of to send off." -- P6

_Do Claims and Health features seem equally useful? Or do participants respond to one more than the other?_

### Claims and health features are both useful, but have different usage patterns

As expected, participants were overall more interested in health than claims. This is likely for two reasons. First, Veterans may interact with health features over a longer period of time - once a claim is filed and a decision is given, Veterans may stop needing claims features as urgently, depending on the nature of their claim. Second, the people we spoke with were not all actively going through a claim at the point in time when we talked to them. For people who were in the midst of a long or frustrating claims process, claims features were highly useful: 

- "I have a claim that's been in since February, [I have] hoped to have it done for 4-5 months...I'd like to see who has it, like to see if there was any progress of it was just collecting dust." -- P6, cited claim status as top 3 priority, (freeform)
- "[The first thing I'd add is] being able to see the accurate status of a claim...I have done 2 claims and 4 appeals. [Today] I check online, see nothing has changed, then call. They have it done and processed before I get the mail" -- P2, cited 'chat with department of claims' as a top 3 priority, (freeform)

Because claims features are highly valuable for Veterans awaiting a decision and frequently accessed, they would be valuable in a mobile app. Having claims features would also cause Veterans to return to the app frequently.

_Is there one feature, or a couple features, that people are most excited about? If so, what are they? Why are they most useful?_

### The top 5 most highly added features in co-design (both in freeform and predefined portions) show that features across health, claims, and more general VA support and discovery are highly desired

| Feature or feature area                                      | No. of participants who added in co-design | No. of participants who cited as a top 3 priority |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Appointments                                              | **7 (all)**, (3 added freeform, 4 added predefined)                                   | 4                                           |
| 2. Secure Messaging                                          | **5**, (2 added freeform, 3 added predefined)                                          | 1                                           |
| 3. Some form of more direct and immediate contact with people at VA | **5**, (multiple features in this area added across freeform and predefined)                                          | 1                                           |
| 4. Checking the status of a claim                            | **4**, (2 added freeform, 2 added predefined)                                        | 2                                           |
| 5. Discovering VA benefits or learning about updates to VA benefits | **4**, (3 added freeform, 2 added predefined)                                         | 1                                           |

Outside of these top 5 features, it is notable that all the participants who added Rx refill in co-design rated that feature as a top 3 priority. This could indicate that Rx refill is higher value than it tested in this study and this should be explored in further research.

_Would either Claims *or* Health be enough for an MVP?_

### Maybe, but testing of a more limited prototype would be needed to verify and there are some risks with taking a too focused approach

Participants responded well to the fairly limited prototype shown in this round (see research question 2), indicting it may be a worthwhile research effort to test an even more limited prototype depending on if VA desires to start with more limited features. Testing of a more limited prototype would be required to definitively answer this question. 

There may be some risks with taking a claims-only or health-only approach for an MVP, including:  

- The app being perceived by users as another one-off VA app and not a flagship VA mobile app. 2 participants from prototype testing expressed frustrating with the narrow scope and linking out of current VA apps, and we do not want to replicate that experience. 

- If we focus only on claims, limiting our MVP user base too much to only Veterans currently managing open claims.

- If we focus only on health, conflicting too much with existing and planned health care management tools (including apps), potentially making this app redundant with other tools.

### Next Steps
- **Refine living roadmap to prioritize the most useful features within claims and health**
  - **Heighten priority of appointments and Secure Messaging**
      - **Further investigate how Veterans use Secure Messaging (e.g. how often do Vets edit their recipient list? Manage folders? Are these things important to replicate from MHV into a mobile app?)**
  - **Maintain priority of Rx refill**
  - **Maintain the high priority of checking a claim's status**
      - **Add more features that relate to transparency and updates into the next prototype**
  - **Maintain or lower priority of uploading a document to a claim**
- **Develop quant study to validate or challenge these feature priorities**
- **Further investigate the process of additional evidence upload in claims (e.g. how much additional evidence is typically needed? What additional documents are most commonly needed? Do Vets typically have to track down additional documentation, or do they already have it?)**
- **Consider testing of claims-only or health-only app, depending on VA desirability to do so**

## Research Question 2

_Would participants download an app with limited Claims and Health features as the core features? If yes, why? If no, why not? Are the features we're showing enough for users to find the app valuable? If not, what needs to be added for the app to be a "great start"?_ 

### All participants said they would download the prototype app we showed them 

- "Yes, I would download this app. [If I was telling other Veterans about this app I would say] this is my go to before I go to anything else and it's more time saving on our end." -- P2
- "I think this is a great start. This would be very much welcome. My husband's medical care is through private industry and he has an app for every doctor he sees...to me [this app] would be the same here at the VA." -- P4
- "Yes, I would download it to streamline all of my VA stuff. It would prevent me from having to logon on my computer and go through all that." -- P5

### When the conversation switched from co-design to prototype, most participants expressed that the prototype felt similar to what they had built themselves

- "Wow, look at that. It almost has everything I want." -- P6
- "There is a lot of overlap with what we did [in the co-design]. It looks pretty close!" -- P3

### Generally the reasons why participants said they would download the prototype app could be organized into 4 areas:

1. **Saving time:** "[The value of an app is] if you think of something, you can check it real quick. Ideally I get an answer before my computer finishes booting." -- P3
2. **Convenience:** "I'm on my phone all the time anyway. Sometimes I think, 'oh I need to refill my meds!' If it is 9 PM, I could hop on a phone and know that if I click this button, this will happen." -- Pilot participant
3. **Streamlined and focused:** "I think [with this app] I would feel less inundated - just go in there, do the task that you want, and get off." -- P5
4. **Not having to log in:** "[An app would be] easier because it is in one place, one login...saves the headache of reminding me what password [to use]." -- P2

There definitely is a desire for more features (see research question 4), however participants voiced satisfaction with the scope of the prototype app shown to them.



---

### Next Steps
- **Consider testing a more limited interactive prototype to test boundaries of what a MVP could look like**
- **Continue to cross-reference Veteran desirability of features with technical feasibility for an MVP**





---
## Research Question 3

_How important and useful are the various features outside of claims and health shown in the prototype?_

### Notifications are highly useful. Veterans value learning about something relevant as soon as possible and voiced that notifications could bring more transparency to their VA experience.

4 participants added notifications to their own app in co-design and 1 participant cited it as a top  priority. Notifications in the prototype tested well. 

- "I'd rather get a message that I can ignore than forget about it...today I only go [to VA sites] because I get the emails and then I go to the site." -- P3
- "I’d want all of the notifications [I see in the prototype]...just to keep up with what’s going on, at all stages." -- P1

**Personalized notifications and more general notifications both have potential to be useful, but personal ones are much higher value**

When participants talked about general notifications they mentioned things at a VAMC level (e.g. event at my VAMC, closures or changes at my VAMC), showing that _very_ general notifications might not be useful.   

- "There are town hall meetings - any kind of meetings - VA does lots of good things, if I knew about them I could schedule appointments and attend." -- P4
- "Notifications would be really useful - the more specific ones that are personalized. That would function the way I think VA launchpad could have been." -- P5
- "VA information would need to be more specific...important things that are happening that we need to know about and suggestions for other things I am eligible for or any changes to their policies [are the types of things I want to be notified about]." -- P2


**Some participants were interested in being notified on multiple platforms**
- "[I’d like notifications in] Google calendar, email, text - I’ll take them all...the more the merrier." -- P6



### A customized home screen is highly useful

A customized home screen is something Veterans would like. However for the MVP, it may be something that feels redundant if there are relatively few features. 

- "[In the 'My Favorites' section of the home screen] I'd probably put notifications. Those seem rather timely, would want to make sure I check them as soon as notice them. Notifications would be my #1." -- P3
- "If we can choose our favorites to put at the top, that would be helpful. My favorite would be claim status." -- P2



### Facility locator is somewhat useful

Facility locator tested well, both for folks newer to VA to learn about what is around them and for folks using VA to looked up phone numbers and addresses. 

- "[I would add] More information on how do I find a VA Medical Facility and see about becoming a patient, and getting more definitive answer to becoming a patient. This goes with 'Find a VA location and get contact information'." -- P3

  

### Saved documents is somewhat useful in a couple different ways

Saved documents can be broken into three different areas. All areas were seen as useful to some participants, although no feature listed below took the cake in terms of being seen as most useful.

1. **Documents pulled from VA profile and displayed to a user by the app**
   - "I would expect to see benefit letters - the one that says your percentage of disability and benefit you get." -- P2

2. **User uploading documents to app for personal use**
   - "Annually I get a letter confirming the disability rating. I put it in my file, sometimes I take a picture of it in case I'm out and about [and need it]. I could keep my doc about my disability rating in this app." -- P4

3. **User uploading documents to app to share with VA for a specific purpose**
   - "Sending and receiving docs can be a hassle - this would cut down on unnecessary trips for documents." -- P5

Where things might get confusing is if a VA app allows users to upload documents for a specific purpose or personal use, but does not clarify the limitations of that feature. When participants discussed uploading files to the document, they did so imagining those files having a discreet purpose at VA (e.g. claim document needed). The app should not give users the impression that it can be use to generally share documents with all of VA that VA will then have and use for a number of purposes. 

Lastly, one participant voiced security concerns around storing sensitive documents in their phone. 

- "If you had [these documents] on phone, and you lost it, you could be in a world of hurt - only way I would do it is if there was 2-way verification." -- P5



### An editable profile is not uniquely useful in a mobile app, but viewing and editing a VA.gov profile is somewhat useful

2 of 7 participants added 'View/edit VA profile' to their own app in co-design. 

- "'View/edit VA profile' is not something I am hooked to do very often. Now I don't know where to look to know what my profile is - but it ties all in together...[looking at my profile in an app] I would make sure VA's records reflect what I think it should be." -- P3



---

### Next Steps
- **Refine living roadmap to prioritize the most useful features for MVP:**
    - **Heighten the priority of delivering more robust notifications**
      - **Explore tech feasibility of notifications on multiple platforms (text, email, push, in app)**
    - **Maintain the priority of an editable profile**
    - **Maintain the priority of facility locator**
      - **Explore the tech feasibility of 'saving' a VA location from facility locator to app**
- **Because all ways the document feature could be interpreted were useful, prioritize one for MVP. Pending tech discovery, documents pulled from VA profile and displayed to a user by the app seems like the most feasible route to pursue.**
- **Start tech discovery of customizable home screen for MVP**
- **Consider testing customizable home screen as part of more minimal prototype to see if it's still important when the app is  smaller**









---
## Research Question 4

_What is not in our prototype that Veterans would like to see in an app? Is there an area outside of health and claims that should be considered either in the MVP or soon after in the product roadmap?_

### Features that allow more direct and immediate contact with people at VA are highly sought after and useful in health, claims, and beyond

5 participants added some form of direct contact with VA in co-design. Participants cited this routinely both during the freeform portion when designing their own app and with the predefined options of 'Request a Call from VA' or 'Chat with VA Claims Support'. 

**Some form of chat was added by 4 participants in co-design**

- "'Chat with VA Claims Support' - I'd want to chat with whoever is taking in the forms, it seems like such a blackhole. You just don't get a lot of feedback." -- P3
- "Monitored chatroom - more like a Slack...I can type a message and I know and trust it's being monitored by a real human being." -- Pilot participant

**'Request a Call from VA' was added by 3 participants in co-design**
- "'Request a call from VA', because then you're not sitting on the phone for an hour or two. I'd want a call from a specific department - if it's random, you'll get put on hold." -- P2, cited as top priority
- "Request a call from VA - Sometimes it can be difficult to get in touch with VA. If there was a form to fill out like "I need help with neurology" - it would cut out a lot of time you might be spending." -- P5

**Personalized points of contact was added by 3 participants in co-design**
- "Get me through to my PCP - to be able to get ahold of someone pretty quick." -- P1, cited as top priority
- "I'd like to have a name, have someone to complain to - either text or email. I don't want it going to someone random, I want to go to the person working on my claim. Calling the VA is like calling the cable company. [With Secure Messaging] within a day or 2, you get an answer - it would be awesome if it worked the same way with a claim." -- P6


### Features that help Veterans discover VA benefits and learn about updates to benefits are highly sought after 

Some form of learning about VA benefits was added by 4 participants in co-design. Participants cited this routinely both during the freeform portion when designing their own app and with the predefined option of 'Get help finding VA benefits'. Benefit discovery features were mostly requested by participants with comparatively low, infrequent benefit usage and benefit update feature were mostly requested by participants with comparatively high, regular benefit usage. 

**Help finding VA benefits was added by 4 participants in co-design**
- "A screening tool - a benefits screening tool. I would want to screen on anything from length of service, type of discharge, gender, LGBTQIA counselor, any legal issues because it impacts benefits, interpersonal violence...[this would be valuable in a mobile app because] I could do something quick at a VA Medical Center or Vet Center by pulling up the app." -- P5 (freeform)
- "Things we may be eligible for - All the resources VA offers - for example I didn't know about Vocational Rehab until the VA person who helped me do my claim told me about it. On one page instead of going through websites." -- P2 (freeform, cited as top 3 priority)

**Updates about changes to VA benefits or eligibility was added by 3 participants in co-design**
- "[I would add] what my benefits are, what they are based on - being able to look that up. And a notification that something has changed - nice to get a heads up." -- P3
- "Every once in a while, there is something you skip over - [I'd like to see] new legislation, COVID updated to know when you can make an appointment to see a person - basically just information." -- P6



### Features that focus on VSOs are somewhat useful 

3 participants added 'Find a VSO' feature to their app in co-design. Throughout sessions when VSOs were mentioned, they were cited as helpful in claims filing but also in educating Veterans about different VA benefits. Somehow connecting Veterans to VSOs through the app - either finding a new VSO or communicating to their extant VSO - should be captured for future consideration in the roadmap. 

- "List of the VSOs in the area, so don't have to go googling it and being able to give them a call or email them through the app." -- P2

- "Locating a VSO would be near the top if someone was first downloading, most VSOs I've ever met are very helpful." -- P6

  

---

### Next Steps

- **Add all features Veterans voiced desire for in co-design to living roadmap for future consideration, testing, and prioritization**
   - **Direct contact with people at VA**
      - **Request a call from VA**
