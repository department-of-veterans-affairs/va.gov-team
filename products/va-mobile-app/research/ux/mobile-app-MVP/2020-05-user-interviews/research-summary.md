# VA Mobile App Discovery Research Readout

May 29, 2020 


# Background and goals
The goal of our UX research is to validate or invalidate bets that were derived from our initial discovery sprint. The following recaps the initial discovery sprint work done before the May 2020 research to give context to the entire scope of the UX research process on the mobile app project:

This research report convers conversational interviews conducted May 4-13, 2020.

# Purpose of May 2020 interviews
The purpose of the May 2020 interviews was to better understand why and how Veterans choose the ways that they interact with VA using mobile technology, and what gaps exist in VA's Veteran facing technology that would be best addressed by a flagship VA mobile app. Going into research, our hypothesis was: **Veterans are interested in using a mobile app to manage some aspects of their VA benefits, and an authenticated app with personalization may add value to VA.gov.** Our research confirmed this hypothesis and led us to define 4 functional groupings of user needs that can be met by an app. 

# Research questions
- What are all the ways Veterans manage their VA benefits (web sites, mobile apps, phone, in-person visits, VSO, etc.)?
  - What benefits or services are Veterans accessing (e.g. education, healthcare, disability)?
- How do Veterans currently use their mobile devices?
  - What non-VA apps (non-social media apps) do they use the most? Why? 
- Do Veterans currently use their mobile devices for managing VA benefits? 
  - If a Veteran uses existing VA mobile apps, what has their experience been?
  - If a Veteran uses VA.gov on mobile, what has their experience been?
  - Do Veterans feel strongly about certain tasks being better for mobile or better for desktop for them? Why?
- Where can a mobile app add unique value to VA’s technology offering (VA.gov et al)?
- What is the “critical mass” of capabilities that Veterans would find compelling enough for an app to feel worthwhile to download?
  - What will make Veterans say “this is a great start”?
  - Refer back to Veteran’s experience with VA (benefits they access) and ask what pain points exist for them there? Do they think a mobile app could help?
  
# Method
- Sessions were conducted remotely via Zoom and scheduled for 60-minutes. 
- Sessions were conducted over the course of two weeks beginning May 4 and ending May 13. 
- We closely followed the discussion guide with some participants, whereas with other participants we allowed the interview to be more flexible to focus on their past interactions with VA. We took this approach because we wanted to give participants space and time to share their experience.

# Research Findings
- _What benefits or services did the participants access?_
- _What are all the ways they managed their VA benefits?_

## Healthcare: 10/10 participants had some experience with VA healthcare 
- **9/10 participants** had used VA healthcare for themselves, while 1 participant had helped manage healthcare for another Veteran. 
- **8/10 participants** had some experience with My HealtheVet, ranging from having used it very minimally to using it regularly for tasks like prescription refill. 
  - **1 participant** had tried to sign up for My HealtheVet, but was not able to successfully set up an account, identity proof, and sign in.
  - **1 participant** used only Community Care for healthcare and did not use My HealtheVet. 
- Most participants had multiple channels of communication with VA and used combinations of My HealtheVet, in-person visits, and phone conversations to manage their healthcare.


## Disability claims: 9/10 participants had some experience with disability benefits
- Participants experience with the claims process varied widely. Some participants filed a claim and received a decision they were happy with and is considered a permanent disability, thus doesn’t require regular follow-ups for the percentage of service-connected disability to be reevaluated. Other participants had spent months or years appealing decisions. 
- Some participants had initially filed claims before ubiquitous personal computing and gone through the process via paper and mail. Participant who had filed and appealed claims more recently mostly used eBenefits, and most received help from a Veteran Service Organizations (VSOs).

## Other benefits
- 5/10 participants denoted on the recruitment screener that they had experience with education & career services
- 2 participants discussed their use of VA education Benefits
- 1 participant discussed VA pension 
- 1 participant discussed VA career counseling 
- 5/10 participants had used a VA home loan


## How participants interacted with VA

- **Web, phone, in person**: All participants had called VA via phone and visited the VA in person, and a majority of participants had accessed VA.gov, but we did not explicitly discuss accessing VA.gov on mobile with all participants.

- **About 50% of participants used My HealtheVet regularly**: 2 participants had not been able to verify their identity in order to use MHV, a 2 other participants were not aware of My HealtheVet. Some participants were aware of My HealtheVet, but not aware of some of the features it offered. Overall, MHV was seen as valuable by those who used it because it removed the need to call or go into a VA facility: 
  - “I use the messaging system, that’s the primary way that I’ve gotten to get my primary care physicians...it’s hard for me to just walk in and see him, so I send him a note.” -- P9
  - “I prefer to do as much as I can online.”-- P6

- **People voiced comfort with starting online**: All participants had had some interaction with VA through VA websites and most described that experience as positive, informative, and their preferred place to start: 
  - "I start online, don't see the exact info I need and talk to someone, but always want to close the loop and confirm what they said to me online" -- P2
  - "Step 1 is educate, Step 2 is list questions and then have a place to schedule a live conversation with an expert." -- P11

- **There is a lack of awareness of VA apps.**
  - No participants had used VA apps. 

- **Relationships are important**: 5/10 participants discussed experience with a VSO, and a majority of participants cited a particular person as helpful in their interaction with VA (e.g. VIST-coordinator, health rep, local non-VA employee aides, counselor, MSA, VSO).
  - "The VSO is awesome. I would actually be very upset if she left" -- P1
  - "I initially filed  with [a VSO] because the paperwork was so overwhelming" -- P7
  - "I did my own initial filing and that was a mistake...I didn’t have all the supporting documentation...[my VSO has] been involved in multiple appeals." -- P8
  - "It comes down to the person you have to deal with...my coordinator is teriffic." -- P6

- **Relationships with individuals at VA can be helpful to Veterans sustained interactions with VA**
  - “I followed up with my Veterans Health Rep who was helping me with my case, she said it still looks like its pending, so I’m still waiting.” -- P8
  - “I had a really good doctor who would make appts for me...the only reason I got the final appointments scheduled was her persistence, I’m not sure I would have had the patience for that.” -- P10

- **About half of participants mentioned Veteran online or offline community, such as Facebook groups or personal friends, as helpful in their navigation of VA**
  - "We had a Veterans Day BBQ last year, I was new then to the community, so folks told me where the nearest commissary was...I found out there’s a VA clinic right over the next town from me." -- P11
  - "Once I got comfortable with completing and gathering info together, my friend showed me the ropes on eBenefits to submit the claim." -- P10 

- **Mindsets in interacting with VA vary from planning mode to emergencies**: Some particiapnts we spoke with did engage with VA in some ways, and were planning to engage more with VA in the future, whereas others began engaging with VA at a time when they were in more of an emergency situation and needed help quickly.
  - "My mind was on a solution to the problem...that was more on my mind than paperwork." -- P9
  - "I’m now beginning to think more long term, preparing for the future [with VA]." -- P11

___

- _What pain points exist in interacting with VA?_

## Signing into VA websites
Several participants voiced that sign in to VA websites is a pain point for them, which echoes prior research into sign in at VA. 
- "I remember to refill my Rx while cooking dinner in the kitchen, and I put the phone on speaker to refill with VA...having to log on [to MHV on my phone] seems like more steps." -- P12
- "If you forget your password, it is like pulling teeth to find someone to help you" -- P10
- "I use the app for USAA banking [more than the website] because even if I login on a desktop, it makes me request a passcode, I then have to say whether I want it texted or emailed...whereas on my phone, it reads my fingerprint and I put in a 4-digit pin and boom." -- P5

## Inconsistency and fragmentation
There can be lots of touchpoints a Veteran needs to interact with to complete a task. Participants voiced needing to talk to different departments or people to or needing to navigate through different websites using different logins to answer a question or complete a task.
- "The one problem I have with VA is things aren’t consistent throughout...It really depends on who who you talk to" -- P6
- "It was like a merry go round going from one person to the next." -- P10
- "I would always get somebody new or different who didn’t understand and I’d have to go through the process again of explaining why." -- P9

There can be fragmentation in coordination of care. Participants who used Community Care or went to multiple VA facilities expressed it could be difficult to ensure their information was getting to all the right people at different locations. 
- "As a Veteran, you are sort of the third-party between Community Care and the VA." -- P5
- "The times when you use an outside medical provider, outside the VA, that ends up being an issue." -- P9

## Persistence and developing expertise is required
At times, it can feel like the onus is on the Veteran to develop an understanding of VA and be persistent until their need is met. This might mean calling persistently until VA has information to share (for example a healthcare approval decision), or navigating through phone trees and websites to find the right place to go. Sometimes, this results in a Veteran becoming fatigued and giving up, or knowing VA benefits are out there but not having the time to navigate exactly how to tap into them. 
- "The patient needs to understand that they need to take control." -- P10
- "The fact that you have to go through an organization that specializes in helping you file a claim says a lot." -- P0
- "I don’t want you to think I’m easily dissuaded but at some point you reach the point of diminishing returns." -- P11
- "I could have gotten everything done through the VA if they had been more responsive...even the VSO was aggravated with the  process and lack of communication." -- P1
- "At the end of the day, they should give you a paycheck for staying on the phone...I don’t have time to be calling the VA nonstop to figure out why a doctor isn’t signing off." -- P5


## Waiting and lack of transparency or updates
It can be frustrating to not know if something is moving forward or not. Several participants voiced feeling frustration at not knowing if and how their claim or healthcare question or request is being handled by VA and expressed a desire for more transparency into the process. 
- "Sometimes I feel the nurse or doctor needs to get back to me, they may just be busy, but sometimes its like I’m in a black hole it seems like" -- P8
- "It would have been nice to get a text saying there’s been a status change, check online...there is anitcipation...you don’t want to miss anything." -- P8
- "Once [a request from Community Care] goes to the VA it goes into a black hole and can take awhile...Domino's has a pizza app, shows you that we got your order, pizza is out of the oven, pizza is ready for pickup. [I'd like that], but instead of pizza it is prescription or sign off from my doctor at VA." -- P5
- "When you dont know what is going on, people get agitated...it calms you down to know what is going on." -- P12


## Understanding benefits eligibility
Participants who participanted in this study were at different stages in their lives - some had left the military fairly recently, whereas others had left decades prior. However, partcipants at all stages expressed that it can be a pain point to discover what VA benefits are available to them, and what benefits they are eligible for. 
- "I am frustrated that I never knew about these types of services once I exited the military." -- P1

**Insight: There could be an opportunity for a mobile app to play a role in transition to being a Veteran. This would require more research into the resources currently available to Veterans in their transition.**


___



- _How do Veterans currently use their mobile devices?_
- _What non-VA apps (non-social media apps) do they use the most? Why?_
- _Do Veterans feel strongly about certain tasks being better for mobile or better for desktop for them?_

## Attitude towards mobile is positive and participants were highly proficient in mobile 
All participants had a mobile device. Some older participants described themselves as not mobile proficient, yet went on to describe extensive and regular mobile device usage. 
- “I spend 6-7 hours a day on my phone.” -- P1
- “The Bank of America app meets all of my needs...very easy to use it from my phone. It’s a perfect example of how I’ve gotten away from laptop to use mobile.” -- P2

## What a “favorite” app is depends on the context
Many participants mentioned their banking apps as useful because they allowed them to keep tabs on and quickly check their balances and transactions. After banking, the most popular apps were social media apps such as Facebook, fitness apps, navigational apps like Waze or Google Maps, and mobile games.
- "Well one of the things that makes it easiest is doing my financial stuff, I can do all of that right here without going to the bank." -- P9
- “My favorite app is tied to what I am trying to accomplish...Waze is favorite when I get in the car, exercise is favorite when I want to walk.” -- P2

## A benefit of mobile is its portability and the ability to do things in the moment
- “I use my cell phone predominantly because it’s the smallest...wherever I go it goes with me, I always have it on me.” -- P8
- “[I was cooking], and thought, there must be a specialized pan for this, so I stopped and googled and found it...I didn’t order it, but that’s an example of the stuff that pops into my head that I use my phone for.” -- P11

## Prolonged or input heavy scenarios are better for desktop
- “I wouldn’t fill out my car loan but I would pay my car bill through a phone app.” -- P11
- “If I need to find out info about VA on a particular benefit, I think that would be more of a long-term process or duration for 15-30 min, don't want to look at the phone.” -- P2

**Insight: A distinction between a flagship VA mobile app and VA.gov might be applying for benefits and completed more complex interactions.**


## Some participants perceived current VA websites as too dense for mobile, and participants voiced that an easy to use and accessible UI is critical for them
- “[I don’t use] MHV on mobile because my eyes aren't the same as they used to be - it’s hard to see. I’ll wait till I'm on my computer.” -- P12
- "[What makes an app good?] When it's designed the site to be visible on a mobile app" -- P11

**Insight: Large hit areas for buttons, comfortable information density, and thoughtful screenreader experience are important for a mobile app and should be considered from the beginning of the design and development process.**


___


- _Where can a mobile app add unique value to VA’s technology offering?_
- _What is the “critical mass” of capabilities that Veterans would find compelling enough for an app to feel worthwhile to download?_
- _What will make Veterans say “this is a great start”?_

## General reaction to VA mobile app was positive
- “If it is a matter of convenience and meets my needs I would be glad to download a VA app on my phone.” -- P2
- “If [VA] had an app, that would probably be the go-to place to go.” -- P6
- “I think a mobile app would be eminently useful. It's like the bank, when you build a good one, people are going to come to it.” -- P11
- “I would probably use [a VA mobile app] weekly.” -- P8

## The most requested features: healthcare, updates, and connection to people at VA
### Healthcare
Participants voiced that they could see an app playing a role in managing their healthcare with VA by an app surfacing My HealtheVet features.
- "Personally I think it would be cool...if there was an app to go into MHV to go into the health things." -- P1
- "If I get to the point where I have a medical appt, under VHA, I would think it would be extremely helpful to manage that info in a mobile device." -- P2
- "If there was a faster way to [refill Rx] on an app, I would absolutely do that." -- P12
- "I’d like to text my provider or a nurse." -- P8

They also voiced a desire for additional features that MHV doesn't offer today, such as online check-in for appointments, seeing wait times for VA Medical Centers to better plan getting their healthcare, and being able to send updates such as running into traffic on the way to an appointment and letting VA know they are running late. Participants saw an app as better connecting them to their VA healthcare and helping them communiate with VA about healthcare more quickly and efficiently. 
- "Maybe there’s a feature where you can request a check in [for an appointment] early." -- P8
- "[I think an app could] maybe provide a little easier access to the doctor care." -- P9
- "I’d also like to see a feature where you can request a nurse triage callback, which is not something you can request today unless you call and talk to somebody." -- P8
- "I'd like to be able to see the busy times at the pharmacy on my phone." -- P8

### Updates
Participants saw a mobile app as helpful in managing their ability to check-in with VA faster and more easily than they can today. 
- "[I'd like to be] kept in the loop 24/7." -- P5
- "[I'd like to] see where my paper is in the process." -- P12
- "Seeing when I received a monthly direct deposit [for my Military pension] to banking account might be useful on VA app." -- P12


### Faster connection to people at VA
Participants consistently stated that they thought a mobile app could improve their communication with VA and better put them in touch with people at VA who can help them.
- "If you could send a quick text they could immediately respond to, not at the end of the business day." -- P1

## Next Steps
1. This research led to the creation of 12 "How might a mobile app..." questions to guide brainstorming of mobile app feature ideas.
2. Those feature ideas were sorted into 4 areas where a mobile app could benefit Veterans.
    - Learning about how VA can help solve their problem
    - Checking in on a status, doing quick transactions
    - Continued support while working towards a solution for a longer term problem
    - Standard mobile app features we think an MVP mobile app should have
3. Those areas were prioritized in a working product roadmap. 
4. A prototype is being testing with Veterans the week of June 8, 2020 to help refine the most valuable features for an MVP mobile app.
