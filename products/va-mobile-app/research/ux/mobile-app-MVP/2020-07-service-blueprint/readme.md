# Service Blueprint

August 2020

## Background & goals

The Service Blueprint outlines the features we are delivering in the MVP and the backstage actions, dependencies, and processes powering the Veteran experience. The goal of this is primarily to outline what VA has to do to power the app/provide these services and secondly to outline what unknowns still exist. 

As of August 2020 the Service Blueprint is still a living artifact. As decisions about the MVP feature set are finalized, updated will be made and [reflected here](https://www.figma.com/proto/RqG1G4ClpWbd7a09ZtLoxU/Mobile-App-Service-Blueprint?node-id=4%3A225&scaling=min-zoom). The Service Blueprint is an output of conversations with SMEs, tech discovery, and user interviews. Below is a screenshot of the Service Blueprint as of August 12.

## Outstanding questions

**1. What APIs/other infrastructure exists for powering general VA notifications?** In user interviews, we learned that general VA notifications would be useful to some Veterans in an app, and we have also heard from VA that being able to send general updates to Veterans using an app is desired. However, we're not yet sure where these notifications would be coming from & what their content would be. We'd like to learn more & decide if this feels like an MVP or later feature.

**2. Do any APIs/other infrastructure exist that can deliver VAMC specific updates to Veterans?**  In user interviews, we learned that Veterans find updates about more general news that are somewhat relevant to them (e.g. events at their VAMC, closures or updates in their region or city) valuable. Does any infrastructure exist that can deliver notifications at the VAMC level?

**3. We think we should include COVID updates in the MVP - where will those be coming from?** Our POV is that COVID updates are likely useful to Veterans given the current climate, and we'd like to include them in usability testing. We'd like to learn more about where general COVID updates on VA.gov come from today so we can better understand if our app can offer them & what their content would be.
