# VA Mobile App: UX Research Overview

## Background

Building a mobile application for VA requires a significant amount of research in order to answer key questions that will ensure any product we develop meets Veterans' needs. While the team completed an initial Discovery Sprint, there are still some unanswered questions and additional validation that is required to determine the specifications of our solution.
This research plan aims to explain the activities that we will use to answer the following guiding questions, validate our hypothesis and underlying bets for what will make for a successful VA Mobile application. Below is a graphic from our April 10, 2020 status update that includes each of these items:

### What is the difference between Guiding Questions, Hypothesis and Bets?

Guiding Questions are the what, how and why questions that have guided our research about whether the VA should build a flagship mobile application. Our Hypothesis is what we think an overarching answer will be for these questions. Bets are specific answers of how we will approach building out our Hypothesis. Each of these items relate to one another to help us form a well rounded research plan.

## Heuristic Analysis

A Heuristic Analysis is a way for us to get a foundational understanding of the landscape of current mobile applications Veterans use when accessing their VA benefits and services. This core activity is used to evaluate these mobile applications using a set of criteria based on a broad set of rules, which are not necessarily specifically around usability guidelines.

### Exploration Questions

Exploration Questions are questions that are broken down inside of a given Bet. They are meant to be open ended so that we are able to dig deeper towards a single solution.

_Bet: Authenticated features are more valuable to Veterans than unauthenticated features._
- What non-VA apps (non-social media apps) do they use the most and why?
- How are Veterans managing their VA benefits and services (apps, web sites, phone, VSO, etc.)

_Bet: A mobile application provides more value to Veterans than a mobile VA.gov experience._
- Will or can a mobile app fill some of the gaps in Veteran’s digital experience on VA?

### Candidates for Analysis 
What kinds of experiences (apps, websites, etc.) should we analyze for context, opportunities, or patterns?
1. Interacts with VA benefits and/or services
The application or website interacts with VA benefits and/or services to deliver valuable information to Veterans. Veterans use it to interact with VA, support their treatment, or better understand how to get help from VA.

2. Accessible by Android and iOS
The application or website is available to users on both Android and iOS phones/tablets.

3. Is a respected “competitor”
We might look at some non-VA apps that offer features similar to things VA does. For example— USAA, VSO, or health care industry offerings.

*For example:*
- VA.gov (via mobile device)
- VetsApp
- USAA mobile app
- Rx Refill
- VA Health Chat
- Ask a Pharmacist

### Output/Artifact
Exact medium TBD. a visualization and explanation of findings. Potentially a gap analysis.

### Timeline
- April 27: Start analysis
- ~May 4-May 11: Complete analysis and report findings

## Quantitative Analysis
Quantitative Analysis is a core activity in which teams look at numerical data and statistics to determine patterns of user behavior. For this core activity, we will be looking at specific data sets on VA.gov, various Call Centers (e.g. WHCC) and mobile.va.gov usage data.

### Exploration Questions
_Bet: Authenticated features are more valuable to Veterans than unauthenticated features._
- Who are the Veterans that will be most likely to use a VA mobile app and why?
- How are Veterans managing their VA benefits and services (apps, web sites, phone, VSO, etc.)
- Has the recent global pandemic changed the types of services Veterans need from VA? If so, how has it changed?

_Bet: A mobile application provides more value to Veterans than a mobile VA.gov experience._
- Will or can a mobile app fill some of the gaps in Veteran’s digital experience on VA?
- What do they prefer to do on VA.gov vs. a mobile device?
- What barriers are there to app usage/download?

### Output/Artifact
Exact medium TBD. Comprehensive report that includes key takeaways from all three datasets. 

### Timeline:
- April 20: Start analysis
- May 11: Complete analysis
- May 18: Synthesize all findings
- May 25: Report findings in comprehensive report

## User Interviews
Performing user interviews with Veterans is a key core activity for us to learn what Veterans most need in a flagship mobile experience with VA. While our initial Discovery Sprint uncovered some initial findings, there are still key questions we are looking to get clear direction for. This study will jump off from where that initial research left off and expand upon those learnings.

### Exploration Questions
_Bet: Authenticated features are more valuable to Veterans than unauthenticated features._
- Who are the Veterans that will be most likely to use a VA mobile app and why?
- What non-VA apps (non-social media apps) do they use the most and why?
- How are Veterans managing their VA benefits and services (apps, web sites, phone, VSO, etc.)
- Has the recent global pandemic changed the types of services Veterans need from VA? If so, how has it changed?

_Bet: A mobile application provides more value to Veterans than a mobile VA.gov experience._
- How do Veterans currently use their mobile devices?
- How do Veterans feel about these existing VA mobile apps and how it meets their needs?
- What do they prefer to do on VA.gov vs. a mobile device?
