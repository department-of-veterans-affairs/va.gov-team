## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Lauren and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them... 

Today we're going to talk about refilling prescriptions using the VA Health + Benefits mobile app.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about an hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I want to be sure before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - If yes: Admit observers. 
    - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)
   - Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?


## Warm-up
* Screener questions?
* When did you download the app?
    * What was the motivation?
* How frequently do you use it (daily, weekly, monthly)?
    * What do you use it for?


## General (Rx at VA)
* How do you manage meds today?
    * Manage any non-VA?
* How did you fill a prescription the last time?
* First time doing it in the app?
    * If no, tell me abt the other time?
* Who else helps you manage these?


## Refill Process

_Research moderator will mostly be in observation mode for this portion of the study. The moderator will invite the participant to speak aloud as they refill a prescription in the app. If the participant does not have an Active prescription to work with, they will walk through their recent experience refilling a prescription in the app._ 

* Pick a med that you need, walk us through the refill. Remind to speak aloud thoughts

#### General prompts
* Notice any issues?
    * How would you resolve these issues?

#### If they do not bring up Filters
* Filters: What do you think each of those mean?


## Detail Screen
* Talk to me about what youâ€™re seeing?
* Any other areas in Rx we haven't touched on?


## Closing
#### Recall the Rx Refill process
* What do you expect to happen after submission?
* Wave magic wand on the app, what would you change?
* Your feedback is an important step in our work on the app, and we appreciate your time today. Your voice matters! It helps us understand what you go through, so we can continue to improve the experience with these tools.
* Thank you!
