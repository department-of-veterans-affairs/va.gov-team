# Participant 10
## Warm-up

### When did you download the app? 
* That particular app probably 6 months or more ago. I am not sure, not to long after it was introduced. 

### What was the motivation? 
* Accessibility. I like technology so one more app that benefits me is my particular need.

### Would you say you’re pretty tech savvy?
* For a guy my age probably

### How frequently do you use it (daily, weekly, monthly)? 
* About every day.

### What do you use it for? 
* Checking for an ongoing approval for a disability claim. That is why I am on every day, and it is really quick. Other avenues of the app not everyday

### So mostly for disability claim?
* Right

## General (Rx at VA)
### How do you manage meds today? 
* I have to access my page in order to check or order. I most recently ordered the prescription using the app last week. It really is as seamless as getting online. It is just as easy and is even easier as it goes right to the prescriptions instead of doing multiple keystrokes to access the information. If that makes sense.

### Did you use the website [MHV] to refill prescriptions prior to the app?
* Yes. When I talk about the page, I mean going on the actual VA website. To repeat what I was saying it takes multiple keystrokes to get to the medication whereas the app you click once to get to the prescriptions.

### Do you have to manage any non-VA medications? 
* Yes, I do have some and it has nothing to do with the VA but it is a mixture of both.

### How do you track those?
* Usually reminders to reorder. I have them in my calendar or I can see on the bottle when it's time. Keeping track of one of those prescriptions is pretty easy and straightforward.

### Do you ever need to keep up with other prescriptions to make sure there are no interactions between prescriptions? 
* There’s a good relation between my primary care in the VA and outside of the VA, I always provide my non-VA primary care with all information to what the VA does to me. They get the list of prescriptions, lab reports, all of those things. In respect to interactions, that is pretty well addressed.

### Great, it sounds like its not all on you to keep up with them.
* No and it's not all on me. I am willing to accept my level of responsibility and to questions to make sure everything is as it should be to my standard. \
 							

### Was there ever a time where something wasn’t right?
* The only thing I can relay to you maybe a year or so ago I have blood pressure problems and the VA put me on a different or a new type of prescription that I had to inform my primary care and there was discussion about that, but the VA acted properly and that was the only not an issue but situation maybe.

### Is there anyone else that helps you manage your medications?
* No, I am capable of that at least at this stage.

### Refill Process

_Research moderator will mostly be in observation mode for this portion of the study. The moderator will invite the participant to speak aloud as they refill a prescription in the app. If the participant does not have an Active prescription to work with, they will walk through their recent experience refilling a prescription in the app._

### Does this list look like what you normally see?
* Yeah.

### Do you have a medication to refill today?
* No but we can look at that. I don’t have any issue with that.
* I really don’t need any medication today so I won’t be ordering it.

### Ok, since you just refilled recently?
* Yes exactly

### Which one did you just do or recall what you thought while refilling?
* [Navigates to recent refill] Here’s this one. Another crazy name. This is an auto injector for migraine headaches. I had just had that filled on the 7th, so 5 days ago. 
* It shows it is Active, I'll tell you what I can do, I think. I can order it and stage it and they won’t ship it until next month.

### Did you scroll like this?
* Yes. As I recall I click Refill request [at the top of the list] and it loads the prescription. Here is the one we are talking about. I click it and it tells me the number of refills then it's a matter of just requesting the refill. It is that simple.
* Then if I want to go back, I hit back and I see that prescription is actively Submitted and it is pretty simple. Then going back, this does show Expired prescriptions. That is probably something, maybe its necessary to alert someone, well that’s not the case. This is showing old prescriptions of the same drug that Expired. Then the one we just did is Active: Submitted. If I click that button it tells me it's been received but not processed.

### Any other thoughts?
* It is an affirmation of the fact that it is being processed.

### Any thoughts on Expired medications?
* I don’t see the need for that. That’s me personally, maybe it would be of help to someone else if they realize that prescription needs to be renewed. I view [Expired] as inactive rather than needing to be Renewed. A new prescription would need to be issued for that. 
* Here’s the same thing that I just ordered and this one is Discontinued. The last fill date was [in May] and here’s the same one for [November] and here’s the Active one. I don’t see the need for that but I didn’t make the app so.

### What do you want to do with those?
* I don’t want them there, it is a waste of space for me. Maybe for someone else it would be of help even though it tells you what is Active. If people has an issue Tracking that it could be helpful but for me it is clutter so I have to scroll more.

### Where would you reference them elsewhere?
* If you go on the actual webpage, those don’t show up like it does here. You have to click on Expired or Discontinued… I can’t remember what it's called. As I remember it, you don’t scroll through when placing an order. I think it is just on the app.

### What if there was something missing or didn’t know what it means?
* I would either call my nurse at the VA or send a secure message on the site, on the webpage directly to them.

### Does that normally get you the answers you need?
* Yes 

### Do you see any filters? 
* Yes. I see Filter by

### When refilling or looking at this in the app, did you use that at all?
* No. I’ll be honest I never paid any attention to it. If I look in it it does give a range. If I click Discontinued, would it eliminate them from the list or would it only show those? Well I guess the only way to see it is to try it. 
* [Filters by Discontinued] It filters it and only shows those. That’s all it would do if I would filter. I could filter as Active I guess and yeah, it only shows those.

						

### Seems you thought [filtering by Discontinued] would get rid of them from the list. 
* Right but it is the opposite.
* I hit Discontinued and applied it. It shows past prescriptions that are Discontinued.

						

### Other terms, what do they mean to you?
* Active is what is available. On Hold, I could assume it is a prescription that is not going to be refilled immediately or available for some unknown reason. Parked I don’t know. Refill in process and submitted are self-explanatory. Suspended, here again obviously not available for refills.
* Discontinued and Expired are self-explanatory. Non-verified I don’t know. Transferred would be like, it is on the outside. Unknown, again this I don’t see myself ever using but I don’t know. I am not sure what all of these in fact mean like Parked, On Hold. I can think about that and come up with an answer and the rest are self-explanatory until Non-Verified, Transferred, or Unknown.

### If one said Active: Parked, what would you do?
* If it was a prescription I have normally been given and I knew that it was available for refill in the past and then saw that it would initiate a phone call or email to find out what is going on with the prescriptions. Again if that would be the case and I wasn’t familiar with it and it manifested itself. 


### So you would either phone or secure message?
* Yes.

### Do you see Sort by? 
* I don’t see that I see All, Pending, Tracking, Filter, Sort by and three Discontinued. 
* Oh, you mean Sort. First off I wear hearing aids so they do strange things. Yes, “Sort” by. I kept hearing “Fort” by. 
* Sort by has the medication name. it shows fill date, medication name, refills left, facility name or A-Z, Z-A.


### Any thoughts when looking at Filter by and Sort by?
* I never used them besides the standard setting a-z and medication name. I guess I could check to see refills left. I never used that. Going into the Filter it showed Discontinued so I need to hit Active and see if they work together. 
* [Selects Active, with Discontinued selected] Okay. That shows 1 refill left, 1 refill left of that, 3 of that prescriptions. So, you can see that without sorting it shows you the same thing. That filter is needed. Refills left, that is available without filtering. In the standard settings show you the active medication and that shows you the refills left without changing the filter.

### Tabs, do you walk those tabs as part of the process? 
* Nope. If I do that it will show the one I just Submitted.

### What information is important here?
* Well the information important to me is the fact that I did refill the prescription, and the VA has it, and it is actively Submitted. That confirms I did that.
* For information specific to this [prescription], I can tap details. It shows it was submitted and the last date refilled. One Expired, Ordered on when it was submitted by the VA. You can see that information.

### What is important as you manage the prescription?
* That I submitted the prescription. I have been on them for years so I know what they do and what they are. It is important that they were submitted and the VA acknowledge that they were submitted. I check Tracking for some things. This shows the last prescription I received. That I filled early in the month. 
* Tracking number and date is shipped and the one prior to that. If I hit that it will take me to the FedEx pay and give me information as to when it was delivered.

### But you don’t normally do this?
* No. I am familiar with the flow of the VA. As long as I can see that I in fact submitted it and they acknowledge it I know how long it takes. This one comes in a cold pack so it is overnight whereas another prescription could take 5-6 days. If you know the process, it is key, if you are just starting out I could see them using more of these tools if they understand how to do it.
* I don’t think there is anything else. You have All, Pending and Tracking. They should be the same. So we’ve hit the Filters, and Sort by. However, it looks to me that if I filter and just want Active and apply that it shows all of the Active. 
* I thought for a minute it didn’t stay in the filter. When you leave the page [the Filter option] doesn’t stay [selected] in the page. It goes back to All. Well if you leave it in All, it shows you all of them which isn’t important to me, what is important is the Active prescriptions and the ones available for refill or not available for refill currently. 
* I guess I would prefer [the list] to stay in Active and the filter remain that way.

### You expected the filters to stay?
* I did. Again if you see it, that time it stayed. Last time it changed.
* I went to Home but last time you clicked Health: Then we’re back to all again. Evidently by design.

### Lets try it one more way, click Active then go to another tab and back to all.
* Pending is filtered by all and then when we go back it goes to all. It will not remain static, it will change back. It is just a key stroke.

### It feels choosy for when filters stay. (validating what was heard and observed).
* Yeah and again if we hit that and then go Home [tab] and go to Health [tab] it is still there but if I bump Health and look at something else then go back [the filter options are] gone. It is back to All.

### 90 percent of the time it defaults?
* Well we didn’t try it going to Benefits [tab] so let's see if that changes. 
* [Taps Benefits tab, then taps Health] It is still Active. It appears to me if it is only when you click Health [tab] again then go back to prescription it defaults back to All or the top tabs. Right.

### Feels like it should stay? 
* I would prefer that because all I want is Active prescriptions. Think most people would be interested in that. If you are looking for something to improve, I would endorse that.

### Anything else we haven’t touched on?
* Not from my standpoint.

### What other tools do you use besides this app and myHealtheVet?
* That I use... Uh they have a prescription app. They have a chat app. Let's see. I haven’t used that. Medication. Here it is VA Rx Refill app. This goes to my login. (Related to authentication and security) Anyone that wants my prescription have at it, giving yourself a shot in the stomach isn’t fun. I don’t think this is going to work, well maybe it will.

### How do you decide which app to use?
* This [VA Health and Benefits] is more convenient, not this Rx one but the other one. The one you asked for originally. This one is more cumbersome; you are now at refill prescriptions and history and medication information. 
* Now you have this thing, it shows it differently but it shows refillable or actively submitted. It is kind of redundant I guess. Same basic information as the other page. It is the same, just the format is a bit different. The same information is there.

### So you say you manage them mostly through the digital tools. If there’s any time you need an adjustment, how does that happen?
* Unless I am having an issue there aren’t adjustments being made. I have been on them for a number of years. And if it doesn’t seem right then I would reach out to the proper department and in that situation I would get a quick response if I was indicating a degree of stress.
* I have appointments scheduled, every 6 months there are scheduled appointments if something comes up I make another appointment

### Are your appointments in-person? 
* My appointments are always in person besides during covid because I need lab work and they are pretty through

### When you are approaching time for an appointment, are you ever prompted to check in?
* No nothing. Well I take that back, there’s a text that comes a week prior asking me to confirm the appointment with a Yes or No. Then as it gets closer I get another reminder text asking me to confirm the appointment and I get emails showing the scheduled appointments.

### How does that work for you? 
* It is easy. It is good. I confirm the appointment and I am good at tracking that kind of thing. There is a series of appointments labs a week prior to the 1-1 with the primary care. In fact so you see this, this will show that I have two Confirmed appointments one work labs on the 14th and primary care on the 18th

### Any details missing? 
* If anything is missing, the first appointment is for labs. I guess it is telling me in special instructions. I don’t really look at these. These labs are conducted prior to the appointments. Anyhow I never get into this section because it is on my calendar on the iPhone. Then again as I mentioned they are good at making sure I remember by reaching out to me multiple times through different methods. I get an actual email with pending appointments 2 weeks prior to the appointments and then start getting text and then another email for an appointment.

### Thoughts on reminders?
* I think they are good. One thing I have shared is trying to make it as simple as possible to make sure that what needs to be accomplished is accomplished. I am good on the phone and computer. I am not hesitant to try things. Other people at 75 may not even use this platform but if they opt to it needs to be simple and intuitive and allow the vet to accomplish what they set out to do.
