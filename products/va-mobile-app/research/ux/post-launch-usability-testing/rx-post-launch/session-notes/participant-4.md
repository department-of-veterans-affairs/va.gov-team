# Participant 4

## Warm-up

### When did you download the app? 
* A few years ago.

### What was the motivation? 



* I live about 40 minutes away from the main hospital. The phone lines get busy, so I wanted the ease of use not to drive in or wait on the phone. So, I can request the refill when it is convenient with me. 

### About to do that right away?
* Yeah, it was straight forward. I am familiar with navigation iOS and apps and logging in. 

### Do you use the Health and benefits or another app? 



* It is the VA prescription refill app

### The app you use: is it Blue on blue (RxRefill)? 



* It is white, VA health and a blue background. Then refill.

### Go ahead and download that: 



* I have that app as well already

### How frequently do you use it (daily, weekly, monthly)? 



* Occasionally to look at letters and documents to check on documents that the VA has for me. A couple of months. It is on a case-to-case basis. I tend to use the prescription refill app.

### What do you use it for? 



* I use the letters, sometimes I will send a message.

						

## General (Rx at VA)

_Participant logs into the app_



* I didn’t have it updated, that’s probably why I didn’t use it.

### Tap into prescriptions, does anyone else help you do these refills? 



* No, I have two children that are adults, and they ask me for help

### How do you manage meds today? 



* I login when I have about 10 days left of medicine, and I will order a refill.

### Do you cross-check with the app or the physical pills?



* The pills

### How did you fill a prescription the last time? 



* This is my first time refilling this prescription. The doctor filled it the first time then mailed it to me. As I said before I have not used this app for this.

### Doctor refills and it is sent: 



* Yes, then if I need to refill it I would go to the RX app to manage the prescriptions.

						

## Refill Process

### Let’s refill your prescription.



*  I didn’t see the refill request at the top. I scrolled to the bottom to look for it, but I didn’t see it, so I scrolled back up

Do you have a preference?



* I expected it at the bottom because there are details then at the bottom is where the request refill will be. You want to look through the medicine details before requesting the refill.

### This screen?



* I would prefer a green check mark so that it signals to me that it is good. This seems a little confusing because I don’t know if I did it right

### What is confusing?



* The fact that they got the refill request. Is it in a que, is it approved. Is it good to go. Will I be notified by the pharmacy. What’s the next step. It has this verbiage at the bottom. I would like it to be more graphic. So, it is clear my request was submitted. The language to be bigger where it is shorter but words bigger. Like once approved the VA will process your refill. I want more confirmation that I did it right. The green line, I would like the full thing to be green.

### Need to [pronounce the interaction] more? 



* Yeah. You know okay I mean it’s going into the VA meta verse. God knows what will happen is the feeling with just this. It needs to be more explicit in what is happening.

### Talk to the sentiment, “God knows what will happen, what’s happened before”?



* SO one time I used the other app to refill a prescription and never got notified that the pill I requested the make/model was Discontinued and I was never notified that it was moved to a manufacturer. So, I thought my doctor stopped the prescription but that wasn’t the case. I totally forgot about it until I got the pills with new packaging. Thankfully it wasn’t medicine that was necessary for quality of life. It was optional medicine on a needed basis. That’s why sometimes you make these requests and don’t know what will happen.

### Do you reach out or try yourself?



* I send a secure message to my doctor. I thought when it said Discontinued. I went back to look and thought it was my doctor because we had a conversation and it seemed like they weren’t going to continue so I thought they went in and Canceled it. They still wanted me to take it just the manufacture was changed.

### The VA term was Discontinued? 



* That is correct. That is what it said on the other app next to the medication. You can see it here to see what I am talking about. Fish oil, active on hold, fish oil active. On the other app it just said discontinued.

### What’s more clear? 



* Well, it is Active but On Hold so something is going on with the refill vs the one below that is Active. For this particular verbiage it tells me it is on hold not the manufacturer. This Active one is on back order so that’s why it is on delay.
* 

Y### ou mean the Fish oil displayed as Active:On Hold is on back order? 



* Yes, that is what the delay is. It was on back order. So again, one thing I would look to ask is the refills left. I need to talk to the doctor about how many I have. This here for refills left tells me to contact my doctor with either prescription.

						

### What about others on the List? 



* Active it means it is active. Active: On Hold means there’s something going on. I don’t know what Active: Parked I couldn’t even guess. Active: Refill in Process, tells me it is approved and being processed. Active: Submitted I guess that would mean my refill was submitted for shipment and that it has been submitted for delivery. Active: Suspended means it is active and suspend. Discontinued I thought that was for the prescription. Expired I have seen that. I have not seen Non-Verified, Transferred or Unknown. I don’t know what they are.

### How would you find out what they mean?



* I would send a message to the doctor saying it shows Non-Verified and ask what it means or contact the pharmacy by secure message. It would depend on the medication, there are some I rely on and then there are optional ones. If I don’t need it, I may not take the time to figure it out but if I need to take it then I would take the time to reach out to see what is going on.

### Do you need to Filter? 
* No not really. I would just scroll to find the ones I need. When I get older and the list is longer I may need the filter to narrow it down to the active ones. Just having 25 I can quickly scroll through.

### What about the information on the Card? 
* Yeah, I think this is, I can easily identify which one it is referring to because I may not know the name or dose but I know when I take it and how much. So that is helpful. The fill date doesn’t make a lot of sense to know the last time filled. Maybe have the next eligible fill date. Some you cannot request too much so if you are going through making refills it would be helpful to know how long you need to wait until you can make that request opposed to when you requested it last. Knowing when to request it would be helpful. If my medication gets wet or damaged, I can see it’s not eligible. Then contact the VA to explain and request a replacement. Or I can see that I can make the refill and do it on the spot.

						

### What about the Instructions?
* The doctor tells me that here on the label is very helpful.

### What about the bottle? 
* Yes, and this is exactly on the bottle too. Good on the card too. Its apples for apples.

### Use the app or the bottle for instructions? 
* Normally the bottle if it is new and I physically arrange it to know which ones to take in the morning and night, so I don’t need to think about it. Because I have it arranged, I know which ones to take in the morning and night. It is helpful to have it on the bottle because if I travel, I just throw it in my medication bag and when I get to the hotel it is helpful to rearrange it based on the bottle instruction.

						

### So, like a pill organizer?
* I arrange the physical bottles in order to know which ones I take in the morning and at night.						

### What do you think when scrolling through it and a details screen? 
* I have it as all, I think it would be helpful to have it automatically sorted for Active instead of skipping over the discontinued. The manufacturer that made this medication was Discontinued. I think it is unnecessary to have it on there twice. They are constantly changing the manufacture for the one that gives them the best price.

### Is it a lot to keep track of to know which is which?
* Yes I know I have it filtered to all. I think having it automatically filtered for only Active ones, that would be great. I wouldn’t need to look at the others unless I am filling out a history page for the doctor. I don’t know why that would still show.

### What do you think of this? 
* I just refilled this. Well I am about to. I don’t know what the fill date is because it is in the future. I have 0 refills left so I don’t know if I can refill this. It is Active.

### Does that match with what you thought? 
* No not at all. I thought I had at least 1 more refill. Now that I think of it makes sense because I am talking with the doctor again shortly. If they have to add a new one, I guess they will add a new on and discontinue this one

### How often do you see them?
* It depends, I talk with different doctors about different things. I talk about my mood and pain with a psychiatrist. Optometrist about dry eyes. Pharmacy about blood pressure to get it under control. Primary doctor for psychiatrist. I talk to 4 different doctors that are zeroed in on different areas to see what is going one.

### Regular visits with the doctors? 
* Yes, and they are all different depending on what we are working on. Pharmacy is more often to see what is going on. That is pretty regularly. Same with my psychiatrist every 3 months. Primary care is every 6 months then if everything goes well it will go 1 time a year. Same for my optometrist is 1 a year. Primary care and psychiatry are a video. Pharmacy and optometrist are in person.

### Anything else jump out? 
*  It would be nice to have a button right here to request the refill instead of having to go back. Now that I found the medicine. Let me find the refillable ones. Okay there it is since I have a refill left. 		

### Does it match your expectation? 
* Yes

### What would be helpful? 
* Having the clinic instead of location. I cannot remember if it was the sleep clinic or primary care that prescribed this. Since I meet with so many doctors about different things it would be great to know what clinic prescribed it. If I had a question, instead of calling the wrong doctor. I am sure they could help but it would be helpful to know the clinic so I can see about adjustments, and they saw something and thought I needed the medication.

### Cut to the chase a little bit? 
* Yes

						

### Do you have community care?
* Yeah, I only have that for my chiropractor all of my others are va. I have the sleep clinic, part of the blue team for primary care, psychiatry is a clinic, optometry.
* They have all of the different clinics that you can do too for specialty care. Between location or having to travel I choose to have the bulk of care at the main location. There is a CBOC, but it has limited services. There has been times I go in and complain about the pain and they look at it and have me get an X-ray upstairs. If I went to the CBOC I would need a referral, then to call the radiology department in order to go get an x-ray. In order to avoid the back and forth I keep my care at the main VA hospital.

### Prompted to check in?
* Um during covid I was. Um, recently I just get an alert to confirm and you get a text then y54 or n 54 to Confirm. I haven’t been prompted to check in externally. I have always went up to the receptionist for that clinic to check in there.

### Text message thoughts?
* They are helpful and they have gotten better. I like that it says in person or virtual. See, this is what I get. [shows check-in text message]

### Does it feel like it is a necessary step for the appointment? 
* I think it is helpful because it is quick and easy. There was one time that the dental appointment just made it. They put in a request and the clinic just made the appointment for me, so it was helpful to see it and put it on my calendar.

						

### Do you manage outside prescriptions? 
* No.

### Anything else you would like to talk about here?
* I would expect the tracking number and method. There have been times I get the medicine then get the tracking information, so I laugh and say this is helpful and click on it and it says delivered. It would be helpful to see it.						

### What about the Pending tab? 
* I think we have talked about the Refill in process or Active: Submitted. I don’t know if it is talking about the prescription or about the refill. My initial thoughts for Active tabs were for the prescription itself, not the refilling of my prescription.

						

### So you think it’s a way to organize the prescription instead of where in the process it is?
* Yes.					

### Anything else on this?
* No, that was pretty much it.						

### Let's look at the fish oil Rx [duplicate] again, what are your next steps [to resolve duplicates]? 
* Contact my doctor and ask her about it. I see that I have an Active fish oil prescription with 0 refills. Do we still think I should be taking those on a daily basis. It may be helpful from here having a button with request a refill but to have to compose a message, so I don’t need to go all the way back to go to messages. If I click on this and I don’t have refills left maybe an option to compose a message that will automatically let me upload this information so, then I can ask if I need to continue this medication.		

### Keeps you in context as well? 
* Yeah

						

## Closing

### If you could wave magic wand on the app, what would you change? 
* I would say for this app to link to the other VA benefits in case you have questions about home loans, education, those types of things. I know it’s a different umbrella but having everything all in one place would be nice. Travel reimbursement would be nice here to , being able to complete that on the app would be beneficial.

### Travel Reimbursement: Where do you do that now?

* I fill out a paper form before I leave or if the website is working. It has been hit or miss. Percent of the time it works for you: about 25% of the time.

### Travel Reimbursement: Do you think the form is more reliable? 

* Yes, that is correct. The website is faster so when I submit it, I get the reimbursement faster. I can’t imagine how many forms they have to process so I don’t know when mine will be entered into the system on my behalf.

### Travel Reimbursement: The website sounds like it would be secure and tracking it better?
* Exactly.

### What would you tell a veteran? 
* That they should use it. I would recommend it because it is convenient to have everything but there is an unfortunate expectation for what you get with the VA . So, it is a good app but be cautious.
