# VA Mobile App Co-Branding A/B testing Summary

April 2021


## Background and goals

We ran an unmoderated A/B test to see if users' expectations change with the use of "My HealtheVet" branding. We want to encourage trust and comfort without setting unrealistic expectations that lead to disappointed Veterans.
Research questions: What expectations come along with referring to MyHealtheVet in the mobile app? Does this improve trust or at least familiarity with the Secure Messaging feature? Does it bring expectations that other features like Rx Refills are already present?
Is the usage of “Secure Messaging” without any MHV branding just as effective? 

## Method

Card sort: Remote unmoderated using an “Optimal Sort” workshop link.
This method will allow us to collect sufficient quantitative data needed in order to inform our design. If we find that users expect features not in the MVP of the Mobile app, we will need to modify the design to ensure users have accurate expectations of the app.
