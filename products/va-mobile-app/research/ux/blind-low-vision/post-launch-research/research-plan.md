# Background
Nearly 40% of traffic on VA.gov comes from mobile devices, with much of that traffic centered around quick status updates; the Department of Veterans Affairs built an app to help their veterans with another tool in their toolbox. The app leverages native mobile features such as biometrics, push notifications, and location and calendar integrations to make it faster and easier for Veterans to check the status of their services and complete simple, transactional interactions across health and benefits in a single app.
Since the VA strives for accessibility beyond compliance, we are testing with Veterans who are blind or have low vision to determine if they can navigate and complete tasks within the app without significant pain points. We have provided 2.1 and 2.2 WCAG guidelines during the development stage with over 88% pass scores. We plan on testing with them using the means of accessibility tools they use in their day-to-day lives. We hope to test users who use accessibility tools that come with their mobile operating systems such as:
* a screen reader (Voiceover / Talkback),
* Braille bluetooth, 
* Dynamic Text (large text),
* voice assistive technology or assistants like Siri,
* and zoom options


# Research Goals
* Identify pain points for Veterans using assistive tech navigating the app.
* Validate veteran's preferred mobile OS assistive technology using whatever tools they use like keyboard navigation and voiceover changes
* Understand how different app experience expectations might differ on mobile .
* Establish foundational knowledge of patterns and differences in experience across a   diversity of mobile assistive technology users

# Research Questions
* Can Veterans with low to no vision who use assistive technology (keyboard, voice, and zoom/magnifier) successfully navigate the mobile app?
* Does the app have room for improvement with these tools and other tools that we may not consider during testing? For instance, would landscape mode be better to assist with a zoom magnifier? 
* Is the content language inclusive enough and not misleading?
* If the app is having login issues( or other issues), what would the veterans workaround be?
* Does the mobile app need to change or evolve to offer equitable experiences, if so how?
* Feature specific:
    * Can the veteran use claims uploads using the tools?
    * Can the veteran access their letters?
    * Can the Veteran find an upcoming appointment? 
      * Can they cancel their appointment
    * Can the Veteran find their Secure Messages?
      * Can they find where to compose a message?
      * Can they add a photo or document when composing a message?
      * Would secure messaging be easier for the veteran to use instead of calling?



# Method
# Participants and Recruitment
## Primary participant criteria
**MUST**:
* Participants must have a mobile phone device to complete the test on said device as this is a mobile app. 
* Have the low to no vision as specified by the following:
   * At least __ participants have an acquired vision-related disability
   * At least __ advanced screen reader user and 10 beginner screen reader user
   * At least __ participant has a congenital vision-related disability
   * At least __ participant has low vision (not complete blindness)

**AND**
Participants must use some form of  accessibility tool:
* VoiceOver iPhone or iPad user
* TalkBack (Android) phone user
* Braille Keyboard that connects to either operating system
* Zoom magnifier

_**Definition of low vision:** For purposes of this study we define low vision to mean ranging from having a small amount of functional vision e.g. the ability to see a box on the screen to being what is referred to in the blindness community as "high partial," which is legally blind but having considerable usable vision, maybe they are a user of screen magnification software and only use a cane at night._
