#### VA Health and Benefits Mobile App

July 2023


## **Intro**

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Liz and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes. Today we're going to talk about your experience with the VA’s health and benefits mobile app.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:



* This entire session should take about 30 minutes long. Please feel free to speak honestly at the level of detail you are comfortable with, there are no right or wrong answers.
* In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions in order to improve the digital tools to better meet Veterans needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
* At the end of the session your feedback will be combined with other veterans who speak to us; your personal information won’t be identifiable in any way.
* If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You'll be compensated no matter how much of the session we complete.
* I have a few of my coworkers in the waiting room, they’re interested in listening in today.  Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session? Your preference is what’s most important so please choose the setup you’re most comfortable with. 
* Are you ok if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
    * If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

_Start recording._



* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

Great, let’s get started.
