**Research Plan for VA Health and Benefits Mobile App: user retention discovery research, July 2023**


## 
**Background**


### 
One of the 10 primary OCTO goals is expanding the flagship mobile app. However, a key part of achieving this goal is the ability to retain current app users as we grow. 


### 
Quantitative data analysis conducted in May 2023 revealed the flagship mobile app loses about 60% of its users after the first month. We want to understand why this dropoff is happening, and what we can do to improve these rates in order to retain a greater percentage of Veterans who download the app. (For more information, check out this [retention dashboard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16kMmtDDMDMw63UDvBavnmIRzlgooFP4WKhXV03bnbWY/edit#gid=394478712).)


### 
Retaining our current users is a key part of our expansion strategy. Understanding why users drop off will help us determine ways we can improve our unauthenticated experience, as well as help us prioritize future areas in our roadmap based on the things users thought they could do when they first downloaded the app.


### 
**OCTO Priorities** \
 \
This research supports OCTO priority #4: expand the flagship mobile app.


### 
**Veteran Journey**


### 
This research connects to the following key stages on the Veteran Journey: Starting up, taking care of myself, putting down roots, reinventing myself, retiring, aging. \
 \
**Problem Statement** \
 \
A significant portion of mobile app users are lost before ever logging-in, and a significant portion of users who log-in during the month they first open the app drop off over the following month, and we are not clear why this is happening.


## 
**Research Goals**



* Understand the main reasons why Veterans download the flagship mobile app. \
Get deeper context of their motivations downloading the app, and what happens for them after they log into the app. Did they find what they were looking for, or did they have issues?
* Identify the reasons why Veterans stop using the app.
* Identify areas of value which might persuade Veterans to continue using the app.

### 
**Outcome**


The outcome of this research will help the mobile app team identify the main reasons why Veterans downloaded the app in the first place and why they stop using it shortly after. This Veteran feedback will drive actionable insights as it will enable our team to develop an unauthenticated mobile app experience, and prioritize future roadmap items that will help us retain our current users more effectively.


### 
**Research questions**

Right now, we have a limited understanding of the reasons why veterans download the app and why they stop using it shortly after. The focus of this research effort will be tightly focused on this aspect of mobile app usage.



1. What was your reason for downloading the mobile app? 
2. What are the main things you wanted to be able to do after you downloaded the app?
3. What difficulty do you experience with logging into the mobile app, if at all?
4. When did you stop using the mobile app? Why?
5. What were the specific reasons you stopped using the app?
6. What are things you’d need to have in order to start using the app again, if any?

### 
**Hypotheses**

* Veterans are unsure of what they can do using the health and benefits app.
* Veterans download the health and benefits app expecting to be able to do something specific that’s not available, and then stop using it as a result.
* Login is a high barrier to using the app. After downloading the app, Veterans navigate away, and don't remember to come back and log in until they need a certain service but remain blocked by the initial login problem.
* Claims driven users have different engagement levels than health driven users, and their engagement with the mobile app is bumpier based on their progress within the claims process. 

## 
**Methodology**


We will interview 20 Veterans using semi-structured remote interviews that are 30 minutes in length. These interviews will be focused on the veteran perception of the mobile app, their motivations for downloading it, and reasons why they stopped using it. 

**Location**

Remote sessions via zoom
