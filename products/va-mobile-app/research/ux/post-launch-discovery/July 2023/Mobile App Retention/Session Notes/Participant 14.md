**Warm Up Questions - 5 min**

The following questions are a way to get to know you better and to make sure we are talking to veterans in different situations with different needs. Feel free to answer the questions you’re comfortable with, and please know you can skip anything you prefer not to answer.

* Tell me a little bit about yourself. Where are you from, where do you live now? West End Gate, Minnesota. 
* How long have you been out of the military? 8 years active 3 reserve. I got out in June of 2008. 
* Do you ever use any type of assistive technology, like enlarging the text on your phone or using a screen reader? I do not. 
It’s typically dark. I don’t like bright screens. 
* What type of phone do you have? Android. 

* What was your first connection with the VA? In 2007 started having health problems. Mental health and general to see my regular doctor. 
    * About how long have you been connected to VA services?
    * How long have you been out of the military before you first connected with the VA?
* Do you receive healthcare through the VA?
    * If yes: What VAMC do you go to regularly? In Minneapolis, probably go at least twice a year. 
    * How far away is it from you? 20–25-minute drive. 
    * Do you also use the VA for prescriptions? Yes. I use through the phone, and I just pick them up from the pharmacy. I have used the app to order my prescription. It actually went well (through the app). The only issue I had was notifications- if they were right or I didn’t have a notification with my provider (on the app).  
* Do you have a disability rating right now? Yes, 60%. 
    * If yes: Do you receive disability payments from the VA? 
* Do you have any active claims or appeals with the VA? Not anymore. I started one and never finished it. But I need to start one here soon. Currently, I do not. 
*What do you want to see in the app if you submit a claim?  To submit documentation and start the whole process, to submit notes, or write out everything I need. Any important information that they need (VA). 
*App vs Computer? I have a lot of my documentation on Google Drive and a lot of stuff is saved on my phone rather than my computer. Everything is tapped into my phone. 
* Are there any other benefits you use VA for?
