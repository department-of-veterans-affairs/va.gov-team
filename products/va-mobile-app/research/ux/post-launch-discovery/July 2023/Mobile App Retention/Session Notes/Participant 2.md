**Warm Up Questions - 5 min**

The following questions are a way to get to know you better and to make sure we are talking to veterans in different situations with different needs. Feel free to answer the questions you’re comfortable with, and please know you can skip anything you prefer not to answer.

* Tell me a little bit about yourself. Where are you from, where do you live now? From Fayetteville and I’m in Kentucky and moving at the end of the month and nervous to moving back. I have a Clarksville VA location and I do use the VA office. Clarksville VA I only use for appointments. The other location is 45 mins away- too far. 
* How long have you been out of the military? Since August 17, almost a year. It’s been rough and I’m in a relationship that is not stable. It’s all overwhelming. 
* Do you ever use any type of assistive technology, like enlarging the text on your phone or using a screen reader? no
* What type of phone do you have? Iphone 13

* What was your first connection with the VA? I was in for a year and when I joined in June. I went after graduating that I had leg fractures and I didn’t want to miss airborne school and I needed the green light. I claimed I had no pain. But after going to Airbourn school I had more fractures and whip lash. Then I got depression. In February I was able to schedule an appointment for my depression and Leadership was not happy that I was always going to sick call but the doctor was also backed up and the doctor was also not helpful and the physical therapist was also not helpful and would only log in where my pain was but that was it. Then I had lab work and found out I had hyperthyroidism and once orders hit, I only had 10 days to get out. Lo looking back, I was building the packet when I requested my records. Legal processed it and once my orders were in, the waitlist takes 21 days. They couldn’t prioritize me on the list of where I was at. VA denied me on a lot of things because of a lack of medical evidence. I’m thankful for the treatment now. I’m at 70% depressed and my last suicide attempt was in April. With my bad anxiety I’m always chatting with my provider and the Nurses call me. The fast communication helps me with the app. FVW helps me file a claim. It’s like a snowball effect, you knock one day it knocks the rest down. 
    * About how long have you been connected to VA services?
    * How long have you been out of the military before you first connected with the VA?
* Do you receive healthcare through the VA? No
    * If yes: What VAMC do you go to regularly? 
    * How far away is it from you?
    * Do you also use the VA for prescriptions? yes
* Do you have a disability rating right now? Yes, trying to file a claim.
    * If yes: Do you receive disability payments from the VA?
* Do you have any active claims or appeals with the VA? yes
* Are there any other benefits you use VA for?

**Thank-You and Closing - 5 min**


Is there anything else you wanted to share before we wrap up? 
 
I had to click everything to get familiar with it. Downloaded in May. Motivated to do it because when I went to the ER in April, I can request my prescriptions. ER nurse told me about the VA app. But I had problems because it said I didn’t have a premium health account. It wasn’t working for some reason. Kept sending me back to log in, log-in but it worked on everything else but the app. The social worker did not help me get through and in June I went to Clarksville and some man E-vet helped me log in without doing anything and I was able to log in with DS for some odd reason it worked then. 
Yes, I use it. I get notifications when I get a message.  
I use it twice a week whenever I send them a message. I only see the VA, not community care. One of the VA appointments I showed up but Nurse comes out, sorry to waste your time, but we aren’t going to see you today because you recently got labs done recently. 
I only use the VA website., I only use app for messaging. I like to go in to check in for claims. I like to see if there’s any updates. 
NO, in the TDIU, it asks to update forms, but I don’t have them. I have a VSO to help me. He also submitted my divorce decree. We submitted that in mid-May. 
I remember clicking on letters and documents and it takes a while to load. I haven’t tried clicking on all of them. I must request and call them in on the VA website. I’ll go to the website because it loads and it’s more reliable. I didn’t know the app had all these letters. 
I had to call Nashville travel place to submit a travel claim, they had to update that for me to see it. I never lived in Alaska, but it had papers from Alaska because I talked to the VA in Alaska. 
The log-in part or profile- personal info, I wish there was a way to update info without so many tabs. Personal info isn’t on there. Lots of tabs to keep up with. 
I’d like to see a list instead of tabs because it takes a while a long time to load. 
Homepage isn’t relevant to me. I just direct message.
