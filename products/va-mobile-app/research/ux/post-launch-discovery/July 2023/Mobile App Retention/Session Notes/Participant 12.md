**Experience with VA Health & Benefits Mobile App - 20 min**
Now we’re going to talk a bit about your experience using VA’s Health & Benefits mobile app. Again, please know you can skip anything you prefer not to answer, or to stop at any time.

* When did you first download the VA Health & Benefits app? July 2021, I heard about it at an appointment. I was trying to set an appointment- front desk at the women’s clinic told me I could do this on the app. 
* Do you use your fingerprint or face ID to get into the app? Thumb print. 
* What was your main reason(s) for downloading the mobile app? 
* What are the things you wanted to be able to do after you downloaded it?
* What difficulty do you experience with logging into the mobile app, if at all?
* When did you stop using the mobile app? 
* What were the specific reasons you stopped using the app? I deleted it because I forgot my password. And I re-added it because I needed to add my step-children and I’m always on the go. I re-added the app in March. 
*How were you adding your step-children? It’s a claim. 
I can see all the claims letters when my children and husband were added. Even my past claims. 
*How often do you log in the app? Multiple times a day to check in to see what’s happening, what’s changed. 
To check appointments and verify payments. 
* What are things you’d need to have in order to start using the app again, if any?
* What other information is important for us to know that we haven’t talked about?
In the direct deposit screen, having that shown to see it’s going to. It doesn’t show if it’s going to the bank. 
The claims section is easy to use. You can see your letters and your history. 
I use the Health section and I like that because it shows appointments and if I missed one and it shows if I’m going there in person. Yes, both VA and Cbok appointments are on the app. 
*Have you used the app to message your doctor? I have not messaged my doctors on the app only computer. 
What website to you use to message your doctor? VA.gov
*How would you like to get notified of new things on the app? If there’s new stuff coming on the app, a notification or text message. I only get text messages for my appointments.

**Thank-You and Closing - 5 min**


Is there anything else you wanted to share before we wrap up? My thoughts are to update the payments page and ensure the info from the app shows up online.
