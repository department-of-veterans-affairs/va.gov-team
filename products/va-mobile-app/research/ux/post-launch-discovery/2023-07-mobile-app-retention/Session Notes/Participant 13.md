**Experience with VA Health & Benefits Mobile App - 20 min**
Now we’re going to talk a bit about your experience using VA’s Health & Benefits mobile app. Again, please know you can skip anything you prefer not to answer, or to stop at any time.

* When did you first download the VA Health & Benefits app? I got an email notification from the VA. Maybe a year ago.
* Do you use your fingerprint or face ID to get into the app? 
* What was your main reason(s) for downloading the mobile app? I thought I could get prescriptions. 
* What are the things you wanted to be able to do after you downloaded it? I would look at the status of prescriptions, I would look at past blood work. I have two appointments coming up. 
* What difficulty do you experience with logging into the mobile app, if at all? It just stopped working. 
* When did you stop using the mobile app? 5 months ago.
*What do you do when the login doesn’t work? I give up. I don’t try. 
* What were the specific reasons you stopped using the app? The last few times I tried to log in, I couldn’t. It was not working. I hit the sign- in and I go to my health net and then that’s when it wants to know my user ID and password- that’s when I get into trouble and finally give up. 
*How often do you check the app initially? I would check on the 1st of the month and check all my appointments for the month… and the status of prescriptions. It’s just a good management tool for me to manage my relationship with the VA. 
* What are things you’d need to have in order to start using the app again, if any?
* What other information is important for us to know that we haven’t talked about? 
*What would you like to see on the app? For me, the VA sometimes sends me physical therapy exercises, I would like to see sites where I can get different exercises or ideas. Updates on medical ideas, updates on therapy.

**Thank-You and Closing - 5 min**


Is there anything else you wanted to share before we wrap up? I can only say that my primary care doctor is the greatest and he’s been on top of my problems and trying to help. 
Maybe something where you can change the login/ password, an easier way to reset.
