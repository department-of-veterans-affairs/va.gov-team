**Warm Up Questions - 5 min**

The following questions are a way to get to know you better and to make sure we are talking to veterans in different situations with different needs. Feel free to answer the questions you’re comfortable with, and please know you can skip anything you prefer not to answer.

* Tell me a little bit about yourself. Where are you from, where do you live now? Northern Virginia, close to D.C. area. I grew up in this area.
* How long have you been out of the military? Since 2006 – 17 years.
* Do you ever use any type of assistive technology, like enlarging the text on your phone or using a screen reader? No.I do use dark mode. At night when you’re trying to calm down or get into a sleep mode. Dark setting is helpful. 
* What type of phone do you have? iPhone 13 pro.

* What was your first connection with the VA? GI Bill and midway changed to the post-9/11 GI Bill. Also used VA for health benefits and home loans.
    * About how long have you been connected to VA services?
    * How long have you been out of the military before you first connected with the VA?
* Do you receive healthcare through the VA?
*Last time you went to the VA? I went 4 months ago for an annual physical checkup. I went through them to use assistance for counseling services so I can see a therapist for a year. 
    * If yes: What VAMC do you go to regularly? VA in D.C., they are also the clinic I go to for wellness needs.
    * How far away is it from you? It’s far for me to drive to the VA hospital. In D.C takes 45 minutes to an hour. Lots of traffic areas. I have to plan half a day if I want to go to the VA hospital. I also used private insurance because I could go to my doctor a lot closer.
With Champ VA my wife and kids can go to any provider. 
    * Do you also use the VA for prescriptions? I don’t have personal prescription medicines. I know it’s available. 
* Do you have a disability rating right now? 100% disabled. 
    * If yes: Do you receive disability payments from the VA? 100% disabled. 
* Do you have any active claims or appeals with the VA?
* Are there any other benefits you use VA for?

**Experience with VA Health & Benefits Mobile App - 20 min**
Now we’re going to talk a bit about your experience using VA’s Health & Benefits mobile app. Again, please know you can skip anything you prefer not to answer, or to stop at any time.

* When did you first download the VA Health & Benefits app? Early this year. 
* Do you use your fingerprint or face ID to get into the app? I think I had to create a log-in. It’s hard for me to remember. 
* What was your main reason(s) for downloading the mobile app? To make it easy to make appointments for the hospital. 
* What are the things you wanted to be able to do after you downloaded it? I’ve used to look at scheduling. I was trying to look up an existing appointment and I also trying to see what other features I could do with it. I found it helpful. 
* What difficulty do you experience with logging into the mobile app, if at all?
* When did you stop using the mobile app? For what I needed to use it for, it was limited. I just needed to check that my appointment was scheduled. Like I mentioned before, it can be difficult to schedule if I go to VA. 
* What were the specific reasons you stopped using the app?
* What are things you’d need to have in order to start using the app again, if any?
* What other information is important for us to know that we haven’t talked about?
I think the assistant gave me a brochure when I was at the D.C Medical center, but I could be wrong. 
* Are those classes offered through the VA? Yes, classes are offered through the VA medical center. I elected to be on the mailing list.

**Thank-You and Closing - 5 min**


Is there anything else you wanted to share before we wrap up? 
I would say a lot of the best apps make it user-friendly and easy to do the things want to do. To not have issues if it lags. Just working on features to make sure they are fine-tuned. Like logging into, enable face ID. It would make it easy for veterans. 
Having ways to communicate with providers like a messaging feature.
