**Experience with VA Health & Benefits Mobile App - 20 min**
Now we’re going to talk a bit about your experience using VA’s Health & Benefits mobile app. Again, please know you can skip anything you prefer not to answer, or to stop at any time.

* When did you first download the VA Health & Benefits app? No, I don’t remember. I get a lot of emails and Facebook- I’m connected with other Veterans. 
* Do you use your fingerprint or face ID to get into the app? No, it never gets my fingerprint right. I switched to the .gov login method, but it needed an authenticator app, but I didn’t know which one. So, I had to delete and recreate a profile. 
* What was your main reason(s) for downloading the mobile app? My letters and appointments to see if I can generate my award letter to see appointments coming up. 
It only tells me Battle Creek VA but no provider information (on appointment reminders). 
*Where you able to generate your letters? Yes.
* What are the things you wanted to be able to do after you downloaded it? Be able to print the PDF and save it from my phone. I was having a hard time with it. I had to email the pdf to print it. 
* What difficulty do you experience with logging into the mobile app after re-loading it, if at all? No issue getting in there anymore.
* When did you stop using the mobile app? 
* What were the specific reasons you stopped using the app? Because it was draining or crashing my battery. 
* What are things you’d need to have in order to start using the app again, if any? The appointment- more accurate and bigger layout. Easier to read/ flow through. 


* What other information is important for us to know that we haven’t talked about? VSO to see which ones are in the area- what organization they’re in. 
Would like to see every single letter. 
Unemployability letter- a way to have that in their accounts. -They will stop their benefits if they don’t turn it on. It’s in VA.gov but not easily accessible. 
Community care- to have that information in the app- not available on va.gov either. 

## 
**Thank-You and Closing - 5 min**


Is there anything else you wanted to share before we wrap up? An app that can provide everything in one App. If there was a link connected to the VA app. 
*What else would you like to see on the app for claims? The decision rating letter, they can’t download that letter- all it says the letter has been mailed or compensation payment letters. I can’t find it.
