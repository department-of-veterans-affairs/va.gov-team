# Comparative Feature Analysis

August 2020

The VA Mobile App team has audited various native mobile apps to understand how successful apps handle the types of features we plan on including in the MVP. This audit is informing UX/UI decisions. In addition to a general audit of all feature types we plan to include, we dove deeper into Navigation and Notifications.
