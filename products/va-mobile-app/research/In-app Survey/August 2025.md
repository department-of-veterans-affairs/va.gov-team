| = Satisfied | 20.08% | 49 |

The survey results reveal a high-level of user satisfaction with the service with over 84% of responses rating their experience as positive. The significant majority of postive reviews (136) related more to user overall app experience due to ease of use, conveience, and functionality. 32 positive reviews specifically related to prescriptions often due to the service itself being both quick, easy, and conveient through the mobile app. 

Representative responses:

> I like the improvements you guys have made it makes it easier to move around and complete different tasks.

<br>

> This app is great! It has simplified my life and made this experience more manageable.

<br>

> This app is now a pleasure to use. Someone put commen sense and intuition into the changes over the past year or so...thanks

<br>

> Honestly, this app is amazing and so easy to use. I’m not the most tech savvy but refills and letters are a breeze on here

<br>

<br>

### Negative
| Rating | % of ratings | # of ratings |
|--|--|--|
| = Dissatisfied | 3.28% | 8 |
| = Not at all satisfied | 2.05% | 5 |

We had very few users reporting a negative experience about the app. Most negative ratings were directly tied to either prescriptions (5) or login (6). Reasons for negative ratings were mostly due to lack of functionality or information needed, login not working as expected or disliking the new login process, and some issues making it harder for veterans to manage multiple scripts or copy/paste content.  


Representative responses:

> This is worse than the last system. A vet should be able to go in click multiple scripts and fulfill script.

<br>

> This app is so woefully terrible…
Whatever you’re paying the developer, it’s too much. Crashes, doesn’t load clean, iOS is current, app is updated. Facial login dies and stops working frequently, forcing a long ID.me login. It’s 2025 and we’re stuck using an app that looks like 2005. Do better.

<br>

> Very difficult to login for 78 year old with mental memory issues.

<br>

> You can't copy to the clipboard the 6 digit number code all by itself.
You have to copy the whole spiel of the text, then compose a message and using that text then before sending it off you can then copy only the 6 digit code. The take the copied 6 digit code and enter to finish the verification. This seems like a crazy process to perform to copy 6 digits for verification.

> Slow  shouldn' need one time code.

<br>

### Neutral
| Rating | % of ratings | # of ratings |
|--|--|--|
| = Neither satisfied or dissatisfied | 5.33% | 13 |

General app feedback that was received with neutral ratings was due to desiring other functionality such as education benefits or more medical information. Some individual comments noted it was  difficult to use, or that functionality was not working as it should such as login biometrics. About half of the neutral ratings were directly related to prescriptions with requests such as automating refills, confusion over frequent refill messages, feeling as if there were too many steps, or not receiving ordered medications at all.

Representative responses:

> There are not enough options. For example, MyChart (UF HEALTH), I can view diagnostic reports, labs, notes, etc. Myhealthyvet should have this level of accessibility. It is extremely limited. 

<br>

> The app is fine, just having issues trying to get medications that I’ve requested and still haven’t received and so having to request them again….

<br>

> Most user UNFRIENDLY APP I HAVE EVER USD.

<br>

> Good but some medication do not show up on the app.

<br>

> Better access to GI Bill or education info and letters.

<br>

<br>

<br>

> I love the VA app! The secure messaging, prescription refill requests, and disability claim information all in one spot is absolutely amazing! And I can sign into it with my face! Great job dev team!

<br>

#### Content (20)

Users often request additional information they wish they received from the app. Some noting confusion over labels, or desiring content in different locations. Several users noted that they felt like the app was easy to understand and being scannable. 

> Team names for Messages need changed Only VA staff members understand what those teams are Make them simpler to understand for the veterans themselves.

<br>

> It would be helpful if the app would tell you what the appointment is not just a room # I would like to be able to be prepared.

<br>

> Don’t understand why certain prescriptions aren’t shown for refill. RX and RX aren’t shown on my refill list.

<br>

> Regarding appointments, you tell me everything I need to know about the appointment except for who it’s with and which department regarding prescriptions. All I wanna know is if it’s been sent why is that so hard to find?

<br>

> Easy to use, easy to reach out to providers. I would like a better option when selecting the department to reach the right people to address concerns. Also, it would be great to actually have a conversation with the Doctor or Primary Physician I’m seeing respond to my questions instead of a nurse or assistant.

### Login

|Login | 25 |

Login continues to be a user pain point and 7 responses this month specifically mention problems with login making it difficult to even enter the app. The negative sentiment around login mentions the complexity of the process, biometric login failure, having to sign in too often, and saved password functionality not working. Despite the challenges, some users still find the new setup better than previous versions and easier to sign in.

Representative responses:

> I love the VA app! The secure messaging, prescription refill requests, and disability claim information all in one spot is absolutely amazing! And I can sign into it with my face! Great job dev team!

<br>

> I am so happy that you got the sign-in fixed.  I hated having to sign-in on the app and then having to do it all again.  It was taking me 15 minutes to request a refill or send a message.

<br>

> Very difficult to login for 78 year old with mental memory issues.

<br>

> The app does not use facial ID on most attempts to login. Only about 20% of the time does it work. Thank you.

<br>

> Usually have to go through entering the code several times before finally getting in the app. Sometimes I don't get in at all.

<br>

> Seems to work well. Haven’t had any bad issues. Only issue I have is the Face ID seems to reset and I can’t use it  which makes me have to look up my password and sometimes I can’t at the time. In one case it caused me to not get my script entered in time and I went without my meds for a few days. But most of that’s on me   It’s still irritating how many times the Face ID won’t work.

<br>

> Would like a longer time frame before having to re-sign in (manually vs the app using Face ID)

<br>

> "You can't copy to the clipboard the 6 digit number code all by itself.
You have to copy the whole spiel of the text, then compose a message and using that text then before sending it off you can then copy only the 6 digit code.

#### User pain points
1. **Complexity and Multiple Steps:** Users express frustration with the login process requiring too many steps and taking significantly longer than before.

2. **Biometric Login Inconsistency:** Some users report that facial ID login is unreliable, working only some of the time.

3. **Multi-factor authentication codes:** There's a suggestion for an enhancement to automatically copy and paste codes sent via text for a smoother login experience.


#### Feature enhancements

### Messaging
| Feature | # of ratings |
|--|--|
| Messaging | 9 |
Nine users specifically mentioned messaging, all in which were rated positive. However, users note challenges with list options needing to identify which department to reach with their concerns, naming, or missing needed providers from the list. One user specifically mentioned a believed bug where the button you type after entering a message saves your message as a draft by default, this resulted in unsent messages the user had believed they had sent. Another requested the ability to create folders.

Representative responses:

> Easy to use, easy to reach out to providers. I would like a better option when selecting the department to reach the right people to address concerns. Also, it would be great to actually have a conversation with the Doctor or Primary Physician I’m seeing respond to my questions instead of a nurse or assistant. 

<br>

> Team names for Messages need changed. Only VA staff members understand what those teams are. Make them simpler to understand for the veterans themselves.

<br>

> There is a major flaw with the messages. When typing, there is a giant button at the top right corner. You press it when you're done typing, and it saves the message as a draft instead of sending it. To send it, you have to exit out of your keyboard, and then the send button is below where the keyboard was. Multiple times, I thought I had sent a message to my doctors, and when I went to look for a response, it had never been sent. When I looked into it, they were all in the drafts.

<br>

> How do you create folders for secure messages?

<br>

> No follow up and or responses to Secure Messages.

<br>

#### Common themes
1. **Appreciated app feature:** Users frequently note messaging as a conveient feature in the app.
2. **Messaging receivers:** Users often commented on not finding or identifying their desired providers on the list options to send messages to.

#### User pain points
1. **Messaging list options:** Users couldn't always find the needed option to send messages to, and noted confusion around naming conventions of Teams.
2. **Draft by default:** One user disliked that messages were saved as drafts by default causing confusion about delivery of message.
3. **Not receiving responses:** One user mentioned not getting responses back from their sent messages. Another user disliked that the response came someone other than their primary provider. 
4. **No ability to chat live:** One user requested the ability to chat live instead of having to wait for replies.

#### Feature enhancements
1. **Message list options:** Provide a path for users to get support directly from the app when needing to message providers not shown in their list options or provide the ability for users to directly search for and add needed providers to the list.
2. **Send direct from draft:** Provide a clear option for users to send a message from their initial drafted message.

Users generally rated prescriptions highly, for the process being easy, conveient, and quick. Users appreciate the ability to submit refill requests directly within the app and find the overall process to be working well.

Representative responses:

<br>

<br>

> A feature that would be a benefit would be to be able to track Rx items that are sent out via FedEx and UPS right from the refill page.

<br>

> Not sure why you added another step to request a refill.

<br>

> Let us request refills that have expired. Then pharmacists can contact medical staff.

<br>

> It would really be nice if meds were automatically shipped when needed. Some of us have [medical condition] and we forget to order meds. Especially when meds all have different refill dates or when someone else fills your pill cases and don't tell you to reorder.

<br>

> I’m very confused because every time I come onto my VA app it tells me I have one prescription to fill then the next day there’s three prescriptions to refill so I do it and then the same thing shows up again. Not sure why or even if my prescriptions are being refilled properly.

<br>

> I wish, when I come back to refill request, that there would be a note that I already requested a refill & date.

<br>
