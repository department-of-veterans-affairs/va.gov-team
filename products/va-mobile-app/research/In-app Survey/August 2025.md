| Rating | % of ratings | # of ratings |
|--|--|--|
| = Very satisfied | 64.34% | 157 |
| = Satisfied | 20.08% | 49 |

The survey results reveal a high-level of user satisfaction with the service with over 84% of responses rating their experience as positive. The significant majority of postive reviews (136) related more to user overall app experience due to ease of use, conveience, and functionality. 32 positive reviews specifically related to prescriptions often due to the service itself being both quick, easy, and conveient through the mobile app. 

Representative responses:

> I like the improvements you guys have made it makes it easier to move around and complete different tasks.

<br>

> This app is great! It has simplified my life and made this experience more manageable.

<br>

> This app is now a pleasure to use. Someone put commen sense and intuition into the changes over the past year or so...thanks

<br>

> Honestly, this app is amazing and so easy to use. I’m not the most tech savvy but refills and letters are a breeze on here

<br>

> I like the app because I’m able to see information without having to go to the full website. It also helps me fill my prescriptions very easily.

<br>

### Negative
| Rating | % of ratings | # of ratings |
|--|--|--|
| = Dissatisfied | 3.28% | 8 |
| = Not at all satisfied | 2.05% | 5 |

We had very few users reporting a negative experience about the app. Most negative ratings were directly tied to either prescriptions (5) or login (6). Reasons for negative ratings were mostly due to lack of functionality or information needed, login not working as expected or disliking the new login process, and some issues making it harder for veterans to manage multiple scripts or copy/paste content.  


Representative responses:

> This is worse than the last system. A vet should be able to go in click multiple scripts and fulfill script.

<br>

> This app is so woefully terrible…
Whatever you’re paying the developer, it’s too much. Crashes, doesn’t load clean, iOS is current, app is updated. Facial login dies and stops working frequently, forcing a long ID.me login. It’s 2025 and we’re stuck using an app that looks like 2005. Do better.

<br>

> Very difficult to login for 78 year old with mental memory issues.

<br>

> You can't copy to the clipboard the 6 digit number code all by itself.
You have to copy the whole spiel of the text, then compose a message and using that text then before sending it off you can then copy only the 6 digit code. The take the copied 6 digit code and enter to finish the verification. This seems like a crazy process to perform to copy 6 digits for verification.

> Slow  shouldn' need one time code.

<br>

### Neutral
| Rating | % of ratings | # of ratings |
|--|--|--|
| = Neither satisfied or dissatisfied | 5.33% | 13 |

General app feedback that was received with neutral ratings was due to desiring other functionality such as education benefits or more medical information. Some individual comments noted it was  difficult to use, or that functionality was not working as it should such as login biometrics. About half of the neutral ratings were directly related to prescriptions with requests such as automating refills, confusion over frequent refill messages, feeling as if there were too many steps, or not receiving ordered medications at all.

Representative responses:

> There are not enough options. For example, MyChart (UF HEALTH), I can view diagnostic reports, labs, notes, etc. Myhealthyvet should have this level of accessibility. It is extremely limited. 

<br>

> The app is fine, just having issues trying to get medications that I’ve requested and still haven’t received and so having to request them again….

<br>

> Most user UNFRIENDLY APP I HAVE EVER USD.

<br>

> Good but some medication do not show up on the app.

<br>

> Better access to GI Bill or education info and letters.

<br>

### Common themes

Representative responses:

<br>

#### Ease of use (74 responses)

Users love the ease of use of not only the mobile app holistically but also key features within the app such as prescriptions or messaging, with a few individuals mentioning navigation was easy, or seeing improvements that simplified login.

Representative responses:

> I have nothing but good things to say about the app and the VA since I've been using it for the last few months. The app is very easy to you and is NOT cumbersome by any means

<br>

> Love this app! It makes things so much easier. Especially for some of us who don’t really like speaking on the phone.

<br>

> I really like the app regarding how everything is organized and easy to use. Extremely convenient with monitoring my medications, messages, and appointments. Also really like the ability to access all letters and proof of veteran status and benefits.

<br>

> I love the VA app! The secure messaging, prescription refill requests, and disability claim information all in one spot is absolutely amazing! And I can sign into it with my face! Great job dev team!

<br>

#### Content (20)

Users often request additional information they wish they received from the app. Some noting confusion over labels, or desiring content in different locations. Several users noted that they felt like the app was easy to understand and being scannable. 

> Team names for Messages need changed Only VA staff members understand what those teams are Make them simpler to understand for the veterans themselves.

<br>

> It would be helpful if the app would tell you what the appointment is not just a room # I would like to be able to be prepared.

<br>

> Don’t understand why certain prescriptions aren’t shown for refill. RX and RX aren’t shown on my refill list.

<br>

> Regarding appointments, you tell me everything I need to know about the appointment except for who it’s with and which department regarding prescriptions. All I wanna know is if it’s been sent why is that so hard to find?

<br>

> Easy to use, easy to reach out to providers. I would like a better option when selecting the department to reach the right people to address concerns. Also, it would be great to actually have a conversation with the Doctor or Primary Physician I’m seeing respond to my questions instead of a nurse or assistant.

Users generally rated prescriptions highly, for the process being easy, conveient, and quick. Users appreciate the ability to submit refill requests directly within the app and find the overall process to be working well. There are several improvements they requested related to surfacing missing information, adding medications (when medication doesn't show up on the list), surfacing the tracking infromation directly from the refill page, and 

Representative responses:

> Requesting refills this time was very easy and painless. Thank you.

<br>

> Good but some medication do not show up on the app.

<br>

> A feature that would be a benefit would be to be able to track Rx items that are sent out via FedEx and UPS right from the refill page.

<br>

> Not sure why you added another step to request a refill.

<br>

> Let us request refills that have expired. Then pharmacists can contact medical staff.

<br>

> It would really be nice if meds were automatically shipped when needed. Some of us have [medical condition] and we forget to order meds. Especially when meds all have different refill dates or when someone else fills your pill cases and don't tell you to reorder.

<br>

> I’m very confused because every time I come onto my VA app it tells me I have one prescription to fill then the next day there’s three prescriptions to refill so I do it and then the same thing shows up again. Not sure why or even if my prescriptions are being refilled properly.

<br>

> I wish, when I come back to refill request, that there would be a note that I already requested a refill & date.
