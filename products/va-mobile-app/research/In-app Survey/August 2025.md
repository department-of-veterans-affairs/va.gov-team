The survey results reveal a high-level of user satisfaction with the service with over 84% of responses rating their experience as positive. The significant majority of postive reviews (136) related more to user overall app experience due to ease of use, conveience, and functionality. 32 positive reviews specifically related to prescriptions often due to the service itself being both quick, easy, and conveient through the mobile app. 

Representative responses:

<br>

<br>

> Honestly, this app is amazing and so easy to use. I’m not the most tech savvy but refills and letters are a breeze on here

<br>

### Negative
| Rating | % of ratings | # of ratings |
|--|--|--|
| = Dissatisfied | 3.28% | 8 |
| = Not at all satisfied | 2.05% | 5 |
We had very few users reporting a negative experience about the app. Most negative ratings were directly tied to either prescriptions (5) or login (6). Reasons for negative ratings were mostly due to lack of functionality or information needed, login not working as expected or disliking the new login process, and some issues making it harder for veterans to manage multiple scripts or copy/paste content.  


Representative responses:

> This is worse than the last system. A vet should be able to go in click multiple scripts and fulfill script.

<br>

> This app is so woefully terrible…
Whatever you’re paying the developer, it’s too much. Crashes, doesn’t load clean, iOS is current, app is updated. Facial login dies and stops working frequently, forcing a long ID.me login. It’s 2025 and we’re stuck using an app that looks like 2005. Do better.

<br>

> Very difficult to login for 78 year old with mental memory issues.

<br>

> You can't copy to the clipboard the 6 digit number code all by itself.
You have to copy the whole spiel of the text, then compose a message and using that text then before sending it off you can then copy only the 6 digit code. The take the copied 6 digit code and enter to finish the verification. This seems like a crazy process to perform to copy 6 digits for verification.

> Slow  shouldn' need one time code.

### Neutral
| Rating | % of ratings | # of ratings |
|--|--|--|
| = Neither satisfied or dissatisfied | 5.33% | 13 |
General app feedback that was received with neutral ratings was due to desiring other functionality such as education benefits or more medical information. Some individual comments noted it was  difficult to use, or that functionality was not working as it should such as login biometrics. About half of the neutral ratings were directly related to prescriptions with requests such as automating refills, confusion over frequent refill messages, feeling as if there were too many steps, or not receiving ordered medications at all.

Representative responses:

> There are not enough options. For example, MyChart (UF HEALTH), I can view diagnostic reports, labs, notes, etc. Myhealthyvet should have this level of accessibility. It is extremely limited. 

<br>

> The app is fine, just having issues trying to get medications that I’ve requested and still haven’t received and so having to request them again….

<br>

> Most user UNFRIENDLY APP I HAVE EVER USD.

<br>

> Good but some medication do not show up on the app.

<br>

> Better access to GI Bill or education info and letters.
