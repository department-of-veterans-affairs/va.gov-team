> I don’t know if this is the appropriate place, but I just left Acadian Hearing Services and was treated like a king. VA is getting their money’s worth with this company. 

<br>

> My claim is still on step 2. I retire in less than a month and have had no contact from the VA. So files a BDD claim but looks like you will miss that timeline. Is this the kind of service I should expect next month once I am a veteran?

### Summary of overall feedback
During the month of August we received a range of responses reflecting a mixed user experience with the application, highlighting both positive aspects and areas needing significant improvement. Many users express satisfaction with the app's core functionalities, such as refilling prescriptions, filing travel claims, and general ease of use when features work as intended. The appreciation for improved access to VA services and the general positive sentiment from some users suggest a good foundation for the application.

However, a substantial portion of the feedback points to critical issues that hinder user satisfaction. Issues that occured this month and were quickly identified with both login and travel claims directly impacted the degree of negative responses. Noted problems include missing information in appointments (e.g., type of appointment, provider details), difficulties with messaging providers due to unavailable options or technical glitches, and general unreliability leading to crashes or unavailability of features. 

Users also frequently report challenges with login, inability to locate expected functionalities like travel reimbursement, and occassionally issues with inaccurate personal information that needed correction with a lack of direct support from the app. These pain points suggest a need for more consistent content availability regarding appointments, improved functionality, and app support when users have difficulty locating needed information or find errors in the app.

### Positive

| Rating | % of ratings | # of ratings |
|--|--|--|
| = Very satisfied | 18% | 18 |
| = Satisfied | 27% | 27 |

Feedback from users who rated their experience as positive frequently highlights the app's effectiveness in facilitating essential tasks such as refilling prescriptions and managing appointments. Many appreciate the convenience of accessing VA services, with some specifically commending features like face recognition during sign in for ease of use. The general sentiment among these users is that the app significantly improves their ability to interact with the VA system and manage their healthcare needs.

Despite overall satisfaction, some positive feedback also includes suggestions for improvement, such as accessing detailed appointment information (e.g., appointment type) and resolving issues with notifications. These comments suggest that even satisfied users encounter minor inconveniences or areas where the app could be enhanced to provide an even more seamless experience.

Representative responses:

> As an old combat veteran, (80), I have seen so many changes. I am deaf from shooting,artillery,combat,and helicopters. My first hearing aids were received at the VA located at [x]. Now at 2025, it is easy to get my medications, text my primary-special physicians. The face recognition is great for ease of use. Thank you for the upgrades for old grunts.

<br> 

> Just recently found out about this app, downloaded it to my phone.  Then submitted a travel claim, very very easy.  The VA gets an attaboy for this.  Thanks for supporting the veterans the way you do.

<br>

> All positive except i am not able to allow notifications. The app tells me it isn't working right now.

<br>

> A while ago the app used to show what type of appointment you have and for a while now it just says the date and time so it’s really hard to figure out what type of service you are having. Can it please be added back.

<br>

> You are doing an excellent job with this app, thanks!

### Negative
| Rating | % of ratings | # of ratings |
|--|--|--|
| = Dissatisfied | 22% | 22 |
| = Not at all satisfied | 15% | 15 |

Users who rated their experience negatively express significant frustration with the application's functionality and reliability. A dominant theme is the lack of crucial information within the app, particularly regarding appointments, where users report not knowing the type of appointment or the provider they are scheduled to see. This absence of detail makes appointment management difficult from the app. Many users express dissatisfaction with the messaging feature, citing issues with unavailable options for contacting providers or technical problems that prevent communication. These difficulties in accessing essential information and communicating with healthcare providers are major contributors to the negative user experience.

Beyond issues with information and communication, users also report problems with the app's overall stability and ease of use. Frequent complaints include the app being unreliable or unavailable, leading to crashes or features not working as expected. Some users find the app complicated to navigate. There are also mentions of difficulties with login and the inability to locate specific functionalities, such as travel reimbursement options. 

Representative responses:

> All of my appointments do not tell me what my appointments are for. I see many doctors and I never can tell who I am suppose to see. I get location of appointment but that is not enough for me to discern what it’s for. Can you please fix that. Thanks.

<br>

> Always says we can not furnish info at this time.

<br>

> I am unable to message my provider. This option is unavailable. I am also unable to find where to file for travel reimbursement.

<br>

> Complicated!

<br>

> Every time I try to use this app, it crashes also I haven’t been receiving notifications from the app either.

### Neutral
| Rating | % of ratings | # of ratings |
|--|--|--|
| = Neither satisfied or dissatisfied | 16% | 16 |

Users who rated their experience as neutral  often highlight issues related to missing or incomplete information within the app or lack of functionality not unlike similar mentions in other satisfaction ratings. A recurring concern is the lack of detail for appointments, difficulty with messaging provider options, accessing historical data, and a desire for more comprehensive breakdowns of benefit payments. These feedback points suggest that while the app may function, the absence of crucial information hinders a fully satisfactory user experience leading to reliance on other platforms like VA.gov for more accurate information. 


Representative responses:

> In the old system I could send & receive messages with various departments and send medical records as attachments. I don’t see this on the mobile app.

<br>

> It stopped loading my appointments. I have the text messages in the email still telling me about my appointments, but it doesn’t give details for what appointments are actually scheduled or which provider I’m going to see. I’ve been relying on my health VA in order to find out this information since they’ve changed it, however and using this little app, it is extremely difficult to find it if it even shows up most times a simple says I don’t have appointment which is incorrect

<br>

> It would be nice to be able to see your records and schedule appointments all in the same app.

<br>

> It’s geared towards younger Vets in my opinion, baby boomers have hard times navigating around. Just saying 

<br>

> Well the other day I was able to reorder my medication, but today it will not let me see the list of my prescription and the status of my prescription. So on one hand your app works then next day it doesn't
