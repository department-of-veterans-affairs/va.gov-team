### Summary of overall feedback
During the month of August we received a range of responses reflecting a mixed user experience with the application, highlighting both positive aspects and areas needing significant improvement. Many users express satisfaction with the app's core functionalities, such as refilling prescriptions, filing travel claims, and general ease of use when features work as intended. The appreciation for improved access to VA services and the general positive sentiment from some users suggest a good foundation for the application.

However, a substantial portion of the feedback points to critical issues that hinder user satisfaction. Issues that occured this month and were quickly identified with both login and travel claims directly impacted the degree of negative responses. Noted problems include missing information in appointments (e.g., type of appointment, provider details), difficulties with messaging providers due to unavailable options or technical glitches, and general unreliability leading to crashes or unavailability of features. 

Users also frequently report challenges with login, inability to locate expected functionalities like travel reimbursement, and occassionally issues with inaccurate personal information that needed correction with a lack of direct support from the app. These pain points suggest a need for more consistent content availability regarding appointments, improved functionality, and app support when users have difficulty locating needed information or find errors in the app.

### Positive

| Rating | % of ratings | # of ratings |
|--|--|--|
| = Very satisfied | 18% | 18 |
| = Satisfied | 27% | 27 |

Feedback from users who rated their experience as positive frequently highlights the app's effectiveness in facilitating essential tasks such as refilling prescriptions and managing appointments. Many appreciate the convenience of accessing VA services, with some specifically commending features like face recognition during sign in for ease of use. The general sentiment among these users is that the app significantly improves their ability to interact with the VA system and manage their healthcare needs.

Despite overall satisfaction, some positive feedback also includes suggestions for improvement, such as accessing detailed appointment information (e.g., appointment type) and resolving issues with notifications. These comments suggest that even satisfied users encounter minor inconveniences or areas where the app could be enhanced to provide an even more seamless experience.

Representative responses:

> As an old combat veteran, (80), I have seen so many changes. I am deaf from shooting,artillery,combat,and helicopters. My first hearing aids were received at the VA located at [x]. Now at 2025, it is easy to get my medications, text my primary-special physicians. The face recognition is great for ease of use. Thank you for the upgrades for old grunts.

<br> 

> Just recently found out about this app, downloaded it to my phone.  Then submitted a travel claim, very very easy.  The VA gets an attaboy for this.  Thanks for supporting the veterans the way you do.

<br>

> All positive except i am not able to allow notifications. The app tells me it isn't working right now.

<br>

> A while ago the app used to show what type of appointment you have and for a while now it just says the date and time so it’s really hard to figure out what type of service you are having. Can it please be added back.

<br>

> You are doing an excellent job with this app, thanks!

<br>

### Negative
| Rating | % of ratings | # of ratings |
|--|--|--|
| = Dissatisfied | 22% | 22 |
| = Not at all satisfied | 15% | 15 |

Users who rated their experience negatively express significant frustration with the application's functionality and reliability. A dominant theme is the lack of crucial information within the app, particularly regarding appointments, where users report not knowing the type of appointment or the provider they are scheduled to see. This absence of detail makes appointment management difficult from the app. Many users express dissatisfaction with the messaging feature, citing issues with unavailable options for contacting providers or technical problems that prevent communication. These difficulties in accessing essential information and communicating with healthcare providers are major contributors to the negative user experience.

Beyond issues with information and communication, users also report problems with the app's overall stability and ease of use. Frequent complaints include the app being unreliable or unavailable, leading to crashes or features not working as expected. Some users find the app complicated to navigate. There are also mentions of difficulties with login and the inability to locate specific functionalities, such as travel reimbursement options. 

Representative responses:

> All of my appointments do not tell me what my appointments are for. I see many doctors and I never can tell who I am suppose to see. I get location of appointment but that is not enough for me to discern what it’s for. Can you please fix that. Thanks.

<br>

> Always says we can not furnish info at this time.

<br>

> I am unable to message my provider. This option is unavailable. I am also unable to find where to file for travel reimbursement.

<br>

> Complicated!

<br>

> Every time I try to use this app, it crashes also I haven’t been receiving notifications from the app either. 

<br>

### Neutral
| Rating | % of ratings | # of ratings |
|--|--|--|
| = Neither satisfied or dissatisfied | 16% | 16 |

Users who rated their experience as neutral  often highlight issues related to missing or incomplete information within the app or lack of functionality not unlike similar mentions in other satisfaction ratings. A recurring concern is the lack of detail for appointments, difficulty with messaging provider options, accessing historical data, and a desire for more comprehensive breakdowns of benefit payments. These feedback points suggest that while the app may function, the absence of crucial information hinders a fully satisfactory user experience leading to reliance on other platforms like VA.gov for more accurate information. 


Representative responses:

> In the old system I could send & receive messages with various departments and send medical records as attachments. I don’t see this on the mobile app.

<br>

> It stopped loading my appointments. I have the text messages in the email still telling me about my appointments, but it doesn’t give details for what appointments are actually scheduled or which provider I’m going to see. I’ve been relying on my health VA in order to find out this information since they’ve changed it, however and using this little app, it is extremely difficult to find it if it even shows up most times a simple says I don’t have appointment which is incorrect

<br>

> It would be nice to be able to see your records and schedule appointments all in the same app.

<br>

> It’s geared towards younger Vets in my opinion, baby boomers have hard times navigating around. Just saying 

<br>

> Well the other day I was able to reorder my medication, but today it will not let me see the list of my prescription and the status of my prescription. So on one hand your app works then next day it doesn't 

<br>

### Common themes

#### Content available (30 responses)

Content available is the most common theme in the responses received this month specifically related to missing needed information from appointments or messaging list options where content was reported as lacking. Some users reported confusion with the labeling, organization, or availability of historical content. 

Representative responses:

> I cannot message my Dr's.  I'm given 5 suggestions, and none of them are my Dr's in [location] or [location]. The appointment section, it doesn't tell you what it's for, who it's with. Cannot do travel pay through here.  I have to access btts, then get sent to the  VA app, back to btts and  then do my mileage claim.    My healthy vet was way better than this.  You never should have gotten rid of it. 

<br>

> I would like the medications that are discontinued and not current active ones to be archived so that they are no longer on my medications list. Also logging out is hard because the system area where I can log out doesn't work. I have to just close my browser to get out of the VA app. Thank you

<br>

> In Upcoming Appointments it would be nice to mention the clinic, or care giver that one is seeing and not just the place. Often these appointments are made months in advance and can get confusing with multiple appointments being made.

<br>

> It would be nice if in the appointments, I could see what the appt if for. Like, Optometry. Labs. Ortho. Dental. Etc. Get it?  

<br>

> Myhealthevet has a lot more info. If I want to know who my provider is I can only get that info on my health vet.

<br>


#### Functionality lacking (19 responses)

Requests for improved or new functionality in the app or also common. These range from requests such as application statuses, to additional claim application submissions. Creating new appointments, or making payments. Additionally reports of things not functioning properly popped up in regards to messaging list options (not providing accurate location or provider options), login biometrics not working despite checked, and travel pay being marketed yet unavailable for a short period of time this month while development teams resolved found issues.

> Maybe add a section to check applications. So if a veteran applies for clothing allowance or something like that, they can track the application. 

<br>

> Should show better info, like more accurate claim status. Also, being able to submit claims via the app would be nice.

<br>

> Where is my health bet, can't schedule primary care dr.

<br>

> It would be beneficial to be able to pay copays from the app.

<br>

> In the old system I could send & receive messages with various departments and send medical records as attachments. I don’t see this on the mobile app.

<br>

> I want to be able to use Face ID to log in. I have it checked but never gets set.

<br>

> Simplify travel claim submissions.I don't see how I can submit anything with this app

<br>


#### Bugs/errors (19 responses)

Users reported believed bugs in regard to the following issues.



#### Navigation or findability (16 responses)

Users noted difficulty locating needed features or information within the app, especially for new users or for new features like travel pay. 

> You can't do anything with your app I think it need to better help a veteran if it's was easier to navigate I think this app is a waste of time.

<br>

> There is no way to get to secure messages, no index indicating messages.

<br>

> Provide the link to the travel pay page. I can't navigate to it now.

<br>

> Sometimes I can't find what i need, so I have to call on the phone and it takes a long time to get some answers 

<br>

> I have lost the messages link on the homepage. I used it twice, but now it has disappeared. Can someone please help me thank you.

<br>


#### General app sentiment (13 responses)

Many users simply shared their rating of the app overall in this survey response. Positive reviews shared their approval of the ease of use, simplicity, and conveience. While neutral or negative reviews asked for additional functions, reported issues with reliability, or desired in-app support.

> You are doing an excellent job with this app, thanks!

<br>

> Real easy to refill my prescriptions & file for travel reimbursement all in one place !!! 1,000% satisfied

<br>

> There has never been a "help" button, or phone number Grrr!

<br>

> All positive except i am not able to allow notifications. The app tells me it isn't working right now.

<br>

#### Usability (8 responses)

Users reported issues with usability on key features such as messaging. While other users report the app's UI being simple and intuitive.

> I got a secure message from Occupational Therapy at the [location] hospital. BUT, I cannot message this person back. It's been an absolute comedy of errors, and not on my part. If a person secures messaging me, I should automatically be able to simply message them back. Your system does not work like that. Thank You

<br>

> This is such a drastic improvement from jusr a year ago. The addition of travel claims is light years better than the bsss system. After years of being unable to make or get travel claims approved, I'm optimistic that things are going the right direction. Beyond that the UI is simple and intuitive. I think seeing our rate and pay on the landing page is a net positive and reassures us we're okay. All in all, great job. Now, don't let the government $#@% it up.

<br> 

> Little confusing at first but was able to get through. Thanks

### General/other feedback (2)
Note: General feedback includes responses that reflect Veteran experiences with their healthcare teams, or the VA in general and may not specifically be related to the VA Health and Benefits app. During this reporting period only 2 received responses fell into this category.

Responses:

> I don’t know if this is the appropriate place, but I just left Acadian Hearing Services and was treated like a king. VA is getting their money’s worth with this company. 

<br>

> My claim is still on step 2. I retire in less than a month and have had no contact from the VA. So files a BDD claim but looks like you will miss that timeline. Is this the kind of service I should expect next month once I am a veteran?

<br> 

### Pain points
In addition to those noted in the primary themes above the following user pain points were shared this month in reviews.

**Travel pay issues (15)**

Users were frustrated trying to find travel pay in the app after VA marketed the feature recently. One user requested the ability to submit community care travel claims. A few users desired more status information about travel claims.

> You have no way on this app to apply for travel pay or see travel pay information

<br> 

> The new Travel Reimbursement is not allowing me to do anything. Same as before. 

<br>

> Wish there was a link to check Travel claims status. Currently, the link only appears when filing a claim and then disappears. Thank you.

<br> 

> You did not add CITC appointments and travel. You have no one available to process your claims on travel when appts are not in a VA facility. This app should be more friendly with ability to apply for travel pay as well for ALL  BA approved appts but it is not.

<br>

**Lack of support for app users (7)**

Many users requested help directly in their reviews or noted the difficulty they've had when seeking help while using the app.

> Sometimes I can't find what i need, so I have to call on the phone and it takes a long time to get some answers 

<br>

> There has never been a "help" button, or phone number Grrr!

<br>

> This app is designed to talk to no one. Once you do talk to some one they have an attitude.

<br>

> I cannot file a claim with VA.gov for mileage reimbursement when I have to travel to the nearest VA facility.  Please help. Help!!!!!!

<br>

**Information incorrect in system (5)**
A few users reported incorrect information displaying in the system.

> I’ve been married for 42yrs. And I only get paid as single!!this is unacceptable!

<br>

> I’ve been waiting 4 months to get my disability back  my pay increase approved for [date]. I can not find any documentation explaining why the delay in my missed pay.  My pay increase went through, but only for the past 4 months.  I’m still struggling with debts that occurred from medical expenses not covered by insurance. -lease help.

<br> 

> My date of birth is incorrect and my date of service is incorrect on the app called the number listed to correct it. The personnel on the phone had no knowledge of the app. Referred me to call [location] personal center.  [location] advised it’s a VA issue.

<br>

> The app has me registered with [location] VA, the VA hospital i use is ][location]

<br>

**Messaging issues (4)**

> Suddenly, none of my providers are available in messaging. I have providers I haven't seen in 30 years or some Ive never seen but none of my current

<br>

> The messaging part of my app is no longer working and I am unable to get any messages from my provider. I receive an email that says they sent a message but I can’t see it. Please help.  This is the same if I logon through the computer, I still cannot see any messages.

<br>

> The only issue I have is that when I want to create a new message it asks me to choose a Care System. There are six listed in the drop-down but NONE of them are the Care System I use. I use the [location]. Someone needs to update the App.

<br>

> Up until today the app has been wonderful once I punched through all the changes. My Primary (wonderful team!) is located in [location]. In the past 2 weeks I've had appts in [location] and now I have no ability to contact my primary (Gold Team). Everything is gone.

<br>

**Login/Logout not working properly (3)**

> I would like the medications that are discontinued and not current active ones to be archived so that they are no longer on my medications list. Also logging out is hard because the system area where I can log out **doesn't work**. I have to just close my browser to get out of the VA app. Thank you

<br>

> Once logged in and you sign out and leave the app, and go to sign in again through login.gov...it automatically signs you in without having to input your password. That is a big nono for security purposes...and needs to be rectified. If the phone was stolen, all of the veterans' information would be compromised. I will be uninstalling the app until this issue is resolved. 

<br> 

> Sure would wish…..facial recognition on my iPad or mobile phone would work instead of the old password technical identification for the VA portal.

<br>



**Medication refill problems (2)**

> The app isn’t working correctly. I cannot order medication past 11 that they show me that need to be refilled. I have to look at my other ones. Please fix it.

<br>

> Well the other day I was able to reorder my medication, but today it will not let me see the list of my prescription and the status of my prescription. So on one hand your app works then next day it doesn't 

<br>

**Veteran status card unavailable (2)**

Two users had difficulty accessing or loading their Veteran status cards.

> Whatever the Veterans Status Card is, it cannot be reached in my case. I've called every number available and nobody can help.

<br>

> What’s wrong with my military status card??????

<br>

**Appointment details incorrect (2)**

> It stopped loading my appointments. I have the text messages in the email still telling me about my appointments, but it doesn’t give details for what appointments are actually scheduled or which provider I’m going to see. I’ve been relying on my health VA in order to find out this information since they’ve changed it, however and using this little app, it is extremely difficult to find it if it even shows up most times a simple says I don’t have appointment which is **incorrect.**

<br>

> Notifying patient/client of an appointment or a reminder of an appointment is great. Major problem VIA text. It tells me I have an appointment but no location info via **app shows wrong location**

| Navigation | 8 |

Most comments around navigation this month were related to issues finding or accessing desired features by users. Individuals struggled to find travel pay, messages, and navigate around the app in general.

Representative responses:

> I have lost the messages link on the homepage. I used it twice, but now it has disappeared. Can someone please help me thank you.

<br>

> It’s geared towards younger Vets in my opinion, baby boomers have hard times navigating around. Just saying

<br>

<br> 

> Where the heck is the messages?!?!?

<br>

<br>

#### Feature enhancements
1. **In-app support or chat feature:** The addition of a live chat feature would aid users to getting support when they need it and could likely improve issues related to navigating the app, opening support tickets when users experience discrepancies, or helping users understand what may be available currently in the app.

2. **In-app search feature:** Users occassionally mention difficulty finding content or features from within the apps organizational structure. Providing a chat or search feature directly in the app would help users be able to easily locate needed content from the homescreen. 

### Login

|Login | 9 |

Some positive sentiment around login was received this month with a few users enjoying the biometric login features of the app. Other users had some security concerns with credential service providers, or staying signed in to the app. Sign out was specifically mentioned also by 2 users, one noting difficulty finding the logout button and another saying logout didn't work for them.

Representative responses:

> Impressive web page. I enjoy the updating of facial recognition. I have been with the VA since 1972.
Thank you,"

<br>

> Google recaptcha is used for login.gov On computer I block google.com so logon is impossible. On iPhone I have no way  to block google so I can log in. Why is the government allowing google to track me on VA and Social security websites? My health and finances should not be handed off to data pirates that refuse to follow laws such as HIPPA

<br>

> I want to be able to use Face ID to log in. I have it checked but never gets set.

<br>

> I would like the medications that are discontinued and not current active ones to be archived so that they are no longer on my medications list. Also logging out is hard because the system area where I can log out doesn't work. I have to just close my browser to get out of the VA app. Thank you

That is a big nono for security purposes...and needs to be rectified. If the phone was stolen, all of the veterans' information would be compromised. I will be uninstalling the app until this issue is resolved. 

<br>

> Since changing the sign in methods for my health y vet cannot use the system I have called put on hold for life time with no results

<br>

> Sure would wish…..facial recognition on my iPad or mobile phone would work instead of the old password technical identification for the VA portal.

<br>

| Feature | # of ratings |
|--|--|
| Travel Pay | 20 |

Travel pay was the most talked about feature in this months reviews. Users were frustrating trying to locate or access travel pay. For those users who reported success (2 reviews) completing the travel pay submissions they were please with its ease of use. Users also desired a way to see statuses of travel pay processing or payouts. 

Representative responses:

> I cannot file a claim with VA.gov for mileage reimbursement when I have to travel to the nearest VA facility.  Please help. Help!!!!!!

<br>

> I get an email that says I can file mileage for appointments on line with VA mobile app.  I can’t find it in the app?  Confused.  Mileage is a joke if you use Community Care.

<br>

> It said we will be able to put our transportation on an app but I'm not been able to find it. It would be handy to be able to put it on there and scan any documents that would be able to go on with it.

<br>

> I’m hearing and seeing information from VA that this app can make travel claims however, in the App Store where it talks about it, doesn’t actually do that it this app. I looked to see if there is another app for this but there is not. Why are we putting information like this if it’s not available yet. Please put some information out saying there is a delay of this app addition or removal of all the information out there until it’s finally in this app. Thank you. 

<br>

> Just recently found out about this app, downloaded it to my phone.  Then submitted a travel claim, very very easy.  The VA gets an attaboy for this.  Thanks for supporting the veterans the way you do.

<br>

> Lost travel info submitted can not find anything that lets me see status.

<br>

> Real easy to refill my prescriptions & file for travel reimbursement all in one place !!! 1,000% satisfied

<br>

#### Feature enhancements
1. **Community care travel submissions:** Veterans an apply for travel pay reimbursements also for community care appointments which may not be reflected in the app appointments section.
2. **Direct link to travel pay:** Provide direct link to all travel pay claims:** Users have difficulty finding travel pays and often desire the ability to go directly there or see more detailed information about the claim than what the app provides.

### Messaging
| Feature | # of ratings |
|--|--|
| Messaging | 13 |

Users commented mostly on issues with messaging in their specific responses. Mostly related to not being able to find their desired receipients in their list options. Additional issues were related to messages saving to drafts by default,not being able to respond to received messages, the messaging area not being found, and historical message access. 

Representative responses:

> The time that messages remain visible needs to be extended. The current time is strangely extremely brief.  I would calculate it to be only 3-4 months. In the VA system it takes months to schedule exams, treatments, tests, etc. 
For instance I discovered a problem in September that wasn’t diagnosed until June. It’s currently being treated. 
So where do I find copies of all my correspondence related to my current condition?"

<br>

> The messaging part of my app is no longer working and I am unable to get any messages from my provider. I receive an email that says they sent a message but I can’t see it. Please help.  This is the same if I logon through the computer, I still cannot see any messages.

<br>

> There is no way to get to secure messages, no index indicating messages

<br>

> I got a secure message from Occupational Therapy at the [location] hospital. BUT, I cannot message this person back. It's been an absolute comedy of errors, and not on my part. If a person secures messaging me, I should automatically be able to simply message them back. Your system does not work like that. Thank You

<br>

> I have lost the messages link on the homepage. I used it twice, but now it has disappeared. Can someone please help me thank you.

<br>

Other than general satisfaction with this feature availability in the app, users reported a desire to hide discontinued medications from their active medication list, see the status of a prescription that's been ordered, and one veteran had difficulty placing orders. 

Representative responses:

> I would like the medications that are discontinued and not current active ones to be archived so that they are no longer on my medications list. Also logging out is hard because the system area where I can log out doesn't work. I have to just close my browser to get out of the VA app. Thank you

<br>

> I would like to see a section in the app so that I can check on the status of a  Prescription that has been ordered.  
Thank you. 

<br>

> The app isn’t working correctly. I cannot order medication past 11 that they show me that need to be refilled. I have to look at my other ones. Please fix it.

<br>

> Real easy to refill my prescriptions & file for travel reimbursement all in one place !!! 1,000% satisfied

> As an old combat veteran, (80), I have seen so many changes. I am deaf from shooting,artillery,combat,and helicopters. My first hearing aids were received at the VA located at [Tower][Year].
Now at 2025, it is easy to get my medications, text my primary-special physicians. The face recognition is great for ease of use.Thank you for the upgrades for old grunts.

Appointments was another frequently mentioned app feature in reviews this month. Users often mentioned the desire for more content or information related to their appointment, requested the ability to make appointments in the app, and reported issues with appointments being incorrect on occassion.

Representative responeses:

> A while ago the app used to show what type of appointment you have and for a while now it just says the date and time so it’s really hard to figure out what type of service you are having. 
Can it please be added back. 

<br>

> All of my appointments do not tell me what my appointments are for.  I see many doctors and I never can tell who I am suppose to see.  I get location of appointment but that is not enough for me to discern what it’s for.  Can you please fix that.  Thanks.

<br>

> In an appointment entry there is a “Reason” field - that is never used. Why not use it to show in what department your appointment is. Like “Lab”, “Primary Dr”, “Men Health” or “Pain Clinic”. Should be able to glean info of scheduler entering the appt, since they are looking at where/who you’re appt is being made to see.

<br>

> It stopped loading my appointments. I have the text messages in the email still telling me about my appointments, but it doesn’t give details for what appointments are actually scheduled or which provider I’m going to see. I’ve been relying on my health VA in order to find out this information since they’ve changed it, however and using this little app, it is extremely difficult to find it if it even shows up most times a simple says I don’t have appointment which is incorrect

<br>

> It would be nice to be able to see your records and schedule appointments all in the same app.

<br>

> Notifying patient/client of an appointment or a reminder of an appointment is great.  Major problem VIA text. It tells me I have an appointment but no location info via app shows wrong location.

<br>

> There is no easy way to determine when a Community Consult is going to expire or whether it is active. It creates a lot of challenges when trying to schedule appointments. With specialists visits may be only on an annual or biannual basis and no way of knowing when the approval expired.  Would like to see a listing of those community consults, status (active/ inactive) and expiration dates in the Health section of the app.

#### Feature enhancements
1. **Appointment scheduling from the app:** Users often desire the ability to directly schedule appointments from the app.
2. **Appointment detail consistency:** Users often mention the lack of specific content related to appointments on the app such as provider name, appointment reason, or location details.
