## Veteran Qualitative Feedback

### Very dissatisfied

Exerts from feedback in this category:

>*"App is too difficult to navigate, the previous VA refills app that was shutdown was MUCH easier to navigate."*

>*"There's no way competent people created this garbage app."*

>*"These apps are awful. They don't tell you who you are seeing or what room number you are going to and I can't find re words of labs or appointment notes terrible app."*

>*"It’s nothing but back and forth trying to get this app to actually work the way it’s supposed to."*

>*"Terrible clumsy inefficient confusing if I was in charge I would fire everyone involved."*

>*"This ap is next to useless. For appointments, it shows the date, time, and place but not what it is for or who it is with.
There are no test results.
Messages are ok, but I cannot create new folders.
This ap should be more like My Chart. That is a good ap.">*

>*Very convoluted, doesn’t show exactly what room you need to report to for appointments, doesn’t give the name of the provider you are scheduled to see, isn’t tied into other systems like btss. *

>*"My Rx Was not on the list."*

>*"How many times do I need to click refill? And why hide the refill button and make me go into each individual item?"*

>*"Why does it take forever to get refills."*
>
>*"Refill scripts and message provider.

>*"Some providers / teams are not in my list and I’ve been trying for a while to get them added with no luck. Send and save buttons for messages are not intuitive. Scripts can be difficult to find for refilling."*

>*"Why can’t you make one list instead of 3-4. This one is active this one is not active. We can send rockets to Mars but we can’t keep prescriptions easy to find and order."*

>*"I requested refills last week through this app, but looking now there’s no refill request. I put in another and hoping this one sticks."*

>*"Refill requests can sometimes take over three weeks! This isn’t great for anyone awaiting medication. I’m on anxiety meds, and the uncertainty doesn’t help my condition."*

>*"Auto renewal option please"*

>*""Checking on a prescription. It would be nice if VA questions, not health related, could be sent from the app rather than using Ask.VA - plus if Ask.VA answers were either here or regular email. 
You ask overall satisfaction , reality is that the app could have lots of potential but doesn’t."*

>*It would be nice to be able to check back on what the status is on an existing order and if it went through."*

>*"This site is becoming more difficult. I needed to refill several prescriptions and I can’t figure out how to send a request to my my doctor."*

>*"I am having difficulty replying to secure messages, and sending secure messages. The reply fails, and all listed recipients also fail, saying that I am no longer able to send to that group, including my PCP."*

>*"Refill meds we need to have all are prescriptions under one refill menu because I have to go from one to the other. If there aren’t all combined also, I think they need to remove all the prescriptions that are old or discontinue if they don’t want to do it, they should allow us to do it so we don’t accidentally put in a refill for medicine that had been discontinued. Thank you.*

>*"Appointments need to indicate what department the appointment is with."*

>*"I like being able to fill my prescriptions this way."*

>*"App works so much better than desktop; except haven’t really tried secured messaging yet!"*

>*"Easy to use, the only thing I don't like is when you need to get a reauthorization for meds there is no "click on" and it sends you to the email your doc direct with "said" med that needs attention."*

>*"Order prescription refills. I would like to see old, expired or cancelled prescriptions either removed from my list or enable me to hide them so I can only look at current prescription data."*

>*Refills. However it would be extremely helpful to display the type of appt (PT, dental, etc), which bldg/floor the appt is located. *

>"App works great now a days. The authentication is still a bit clunky and brings the browser into the security chain and potentially put user information at risk. Other than that the ease of prescription refills and making appointments has greatly improved."*

>*Would like to see how many refills are left on the prescription, similar to when we phone in to the VA Pharmacy.*

>*"Well designed app and makes it almost fun to use.*

>*I was filling prescriptions but some input, could we see our lab tests in the app soon."*

>*"Refill meds, check appts and messages. This app ROCKS."*

>*"Easy to get refills & check claim status"*

>*This app is amazing and easy to use.. Please stay with easy login steps for the older veterans though lol.*

>*I think thus has been a very easy a great experience.  Steps to follow are simply laid out and goes through immediately.*

>*Sense I have learned to use the app checking my appointments and reordering my medication has been a lot easier.*

>*Yes, I think they finally got this app working it’s pretty quick. I’d like to just go down the list of refills and check out. It’s a little confusion to go back-and-forth cause I’m a little dyslexic. Other than that it’s a really good app and it’s fast but I would like a section about asking the doctor about any refills or additional prescriptions. I am a health Scientist, but the VA doctors always exceed my expectation.*
