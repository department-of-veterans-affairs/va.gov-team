# Plan for Documentating VA's Mobile Design Components

## Background
For VA's MVP flagship mobile app, UX designers are using a mix of system components and VA design elements. To document these components, we are taking a four-step approach modeled off of VA.gov's progression (VA.gov started with lean documentation in Sketch and eventually created its own design website and component library).

## Approach 

1. Single Sketch file with all components, shared by designers **(MVP: Oct 2020)**
2. Components extracted from mobile app in design-system repo **(Post-Launch: Early 2021)**
3. npm module containing styles and plain JS for all patterns/components **(Post-Launch: Early 2021)**
4. Determine whether mobile components should be incorporated in VA.gov's existing design library (https://design.va.gov/) or potentially its own design library. **(TBD)**
