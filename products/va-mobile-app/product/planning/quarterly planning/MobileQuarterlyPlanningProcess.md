# Mobile Quarterly Planning Process

## Goal
Ensure the mobile teams have a plan for the work occuring in the upcoming quarter, with an eye specifically towards dependencies and risks.

We want to do the smallest amount of planning needed to ensure the team has an idea of what is coming and any dependencies and risks have been identified.

## Cadence and Process
Quarterly Planning discussions and meetings begin ~3weeks before the start of the next quarter.  We try to use existing meetings (SoS, PM Sync) to cover planning topics when possible.  

1. Mobile Team PMs work with VA POs to understand what Epics should be in consideration for the upcoming quarter (ongoing)
   - Understand basic priority of all upcoming Epics in relation to each other
   - PM updates the Epics on the SoS board so Epics are in the Next or Later columns
2. Previous Quarter Recap Presentation (~3 weeks before end of quarter)
   - Compare original quarterly plan with what was actually worked on
      - discuss deltas
   - Show progress against Program and Team OKRs
   - VA POs discuss high-level goals of upcoming quarter
3. Mobile Team PMs work with Mobile Leads to gather team member capacity for upcoming quarter (~2-3 weeks before end of quarter)
   - Team members fill out PTO requests in UKG
   - Practice Leads enter capacity into the Capacity Spreadsheet
   - PM adds available capacity into Sprints Tab for each sprint
4. Mobile Team PMs work with their team members to create high-level plan of the upcoming Epics (~2 weeks before end of quarter)
   - Create high-level LOEs for each Epic
   - Identify Open Questions and unknowns
      - PM works with POs to answer questions
   - Identify Risks and Dependencies
      - PM surfaces risks and dependencies in planning checkpoints
5. Mobile Team PMs organize the Epic work into the Sprints Tab based on priority and dependencies (~1.5 weeks before end of quarter)
6. Review plan with other Mobile teams and VA POs (~0.5-1 week before end of quarter)
   - Mobile Team PMs present their team's plan at last SoS before the Sprint starts
   - Invite Experience Team POs as needed, or review plan with them in 1:1 outside of SoS
   - PMs update plan based on feedback
