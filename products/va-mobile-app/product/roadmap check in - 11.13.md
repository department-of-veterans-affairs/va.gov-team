### Q1: What should we prioritize for V1 (friendly-release)?

For V1, we should focus on the epics that are currently in Zenhub (key features being Profile, Appointments, Claims) and ensure that they are implemented completely and throroughly so as not to accumulate tech or design debt. This may be at the expense of adding new features (eg, POA), however we believe users will value quality over quantity.

### Q2: Should we try to get *any* new features into V1 that aren't on the current roadmap?
For V1, we should explore whether features that are already being built, like POA or disability rating, are ready to go and easy to implement. If they are, we will push for them to be in V1.

### Q3: How should we prioritize accessibility features that are newly discovered?
For V1, we should add them as we find them to the backlog and look to Martha/Steve to help us prioritize in sprint planning.

### Q4: What is our release date?
For V1, we will release it to a group of VA employees and conduct usability testing in January. Once we have collected enough data, we will analyze it to determine whether we are ready to release the app to the public in its current form or whether we need more time to add additional features. During this period, developers will also continue building Secure Messaging so that that feature could potentially be added before our public release.
