# [Archive] Mobile Collaboration Cycle

## Purpose

The VA mobile app is not a typical VA.gov product and therefore will deviate from the standard VSP collaboration cycle. The purpose of this document is to describe what the mobile app team did pre and post-launch to get VA's flagship mobile MVP shipped.

# Project Kickoff

## What Happened?
- Prior to the official VSP orientation, the mobile app's Product Lead met with VSP's Product Manager to discuss areas where the app might deviate from the standard collaboration cycle (eg, accessibility review) however both product teams agreed that a VSP orientation would be beneficial to the entire mobile app team. 
- During the official VSP orientation, the standard format was followed but there was mention of the areas where the mobile app team might do things differently. 
## How Did It Go?
- The mobile app team thought that the VSP orientation was valuable and it was helpful to learn about the various VSP resources.
