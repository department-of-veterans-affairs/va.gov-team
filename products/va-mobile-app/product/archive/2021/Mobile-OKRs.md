# [Archive] Mobile App Measures of Success

[To be updated]

## Overall Bet

What value does the app provide to Veterans? Our big bet is that:

**A native mobile app provides value to Veterans by making it easier to complete transactions with VA.**

*How will we know whether we were right about this bet?*

## Measures of Success for Veterans

**All KPIs tracked in spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G-Ru00IIEVCeMbYMqWVDTLO0f4WDdVrchPp0dIHM1N4/edit#gid=1172783502)**

### Objective: Veterans can access their authenticated experience quickly and easily on the mobile app.

- KR: Establish baseline biometric uptake
  - KPI: Biometric login opt-in rate

- KR: Increase login success rates compared to VA.gov
-   KPI: Login start-success rate


### Objective: Veterans can more easily complete transactions on the app than they can on VA desktop or mobile web services

- KRs: rate of task completion is on par with or higher than VA.gov or MHV counterpart

  - KPIs: rate of task completion for all features (utilization?) (for SM: percent of users who begin a message, who then send it; for VAOS: in the future, appointment completion rate in the funnel

- KR: speed of task completion is on par with or higher than VA.gov or MHV counterpart
  - KPIs:  speed of task completion for features (for SM: time it takes between clicking into the Secure Messaging feature, to send a message?)

- KR: Eligible Vets manage benefits across both health and benefits
  - KPI: number of sessions that include visits to both health and benefit features

- KR: Vets take advantage of native functionality in the app
_helps us answer: was it the right bet to build this app natively?_
  - KPI: frequency of usage of allowing location services, or adding VAOS appointment to calendar, or using camera for uploading a claime file, or sending an SMS via the VCL link, or clicking to call a help line directly from the app


### Objective: Vets gain peace of mind by using the app
_Reducing the feeling of VA being a "black hole" or needing to be persistent to follow up on benefits_

- KR: x% push notification opt in rate and open rate

- KR: Reduce time to respond to requests for additional information
  - KPI: Time to open Secure Message from receiving email or push notification that new message has arrrived (_note, needs investigation to see whether this is possible to measure_)
  - KPI: Time to upload more documentation to a claim from receiving email that more info is requested by VA (_note, not possible to measure yet_)

## Measures of Success for VA
**What sources of value might the app provide for OCTO and VA?**

- Break down silos: Build closer ties between OCTO and OCC/MHV

  - Collaborating increases visibility into each other's priorities and build trust and open communication channels

- Demonstrate iterative, agile ways of product development to other parts of VA

- Sandbox: The app allows us to test new user flows in a new channel, while consuming the same backend MHV APIs (and in the future, Cerner APIs)

- Reach new customer groups: Depending on what we learn from usage behavior, the app may allow VA to engage with groups of Veterans who might not otherwise be interacting with VA online

- Feature differentiation: The mobile app allows us to provide some fundamentally different experiences than we can on websites (biometrics, push notifications, location

- Learn more about our beneficiaries: We expect to gain granular customer behavior data from the app that will teach us more about how Veterans interact with VA digitally

### Organizational Objective: The VA can place an app that integrates health and benefits information into the app store.

-KR: We are placed in app store
  - App store approvals
  - Downloads

- KR: We have approval from VSP and OCTO stakeholders
  - Approvals from VSP and OCTO stakeholders

## How might our goal for the app change over time?

- Now - Companion App: Vets who already consume VA services and engage with VA websites find it easier to complete transactions on the mobile app (companion to the website)

- Next - Channel of Choice: A subset of Veterans _prefer_ managing their benefits on the app over using VA websites (mobile app becomes their preferred channel). Requires setting up analytics to track individual user's behavior across web and mobile

- Later - User Acquisition: Increased engagement by new user group - Vets who do not already interact with VA online begin to use the app (increase the pie of Vets engaging with VA digitally)

## Open questions:

- Is this a companion app, or do we want to shift volume from VA websites to mobile -- at least for the transactions that we build in the app?

- Do we ever want the app to be a place where Veterans find new benefits?

- How will user groups change over time?

- What makes someone more likely to use our app? Are they highly digitally engaged across both web and mobile? Or are we reaching new and different users altogether?

- How do we handle the soft launch aspect - ie, numbers of downloads will be low from the start

- "A subset of digitally engaged Vets shift preference from VA.gov to VA Mobile app for key transactions": how can we measure this? 

- Relationship to VA.gov: do we cannibalize traffic for some users? Or we might find that it increases digital engagement overall (ie, Vets who interact more on mobile, also interact more on VA.gov and MHV)
