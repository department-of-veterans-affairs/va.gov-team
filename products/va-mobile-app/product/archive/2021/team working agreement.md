## VFS Teams

Since the mobile app MVP is replicating functionality that exists on VA.gov today, it makes sense to stay connected to the teams that are currently working on this functionality to ensure we are aware of any changes to their data models. These teams include:
- [VAOS](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/265974319dfa35a26f88779f100c7ade50508b56/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling): Overlap with mobile **Appointment** feature, including appointments page and push notifications for appointment reminders
- [Profile / Logged-in Homepage](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/ffbfc47a250788a795cc73a2112c317023a39733/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign): Overlap with mobile **Profile**
- [Claims Status Tool](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/ca2514e624dcf5b245cf662f17839c6c5cee69f0/products/claim-appeal-status/README.md): Overlap with mobile **Claims** features, including the ability to view claims in detail and push notification updates for changes to claim status

- **Claims Status Tool:** TBD

### Cadence with VSP

## Tools
### Repos
- Content is in va.gov-team
- API code is in vets-api
- Mobile code is in TBD

### Zenhub  
- **Board:** VFS 
- **Workspace:** VA Mobile App
- **Label:** va-mobile-app

**Tickets in a sprint include these pipelines:**
- In progress
- Current sprint

**Tickets outside a sprint include these pipelines:**
- Backlog
- Icebox 

**Story Point System**

1 - the amount of time it takes to drink a cup of coffee  :coffee:

2 - a morning :sunrise:

3 - an afternoon :hamburger:

5 - a full workday :bridge_at_night:

8 - 1.5 days :beer:

If a story is bigger than an 8, we try to break it down to smaller stories or sub-task it so itâ€™s easier to track progress.
