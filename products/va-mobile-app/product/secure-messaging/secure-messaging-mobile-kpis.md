# Mobile App Secure Messaging KPIs (draft)

## Product North Star Metric 
* Time between a provider sending a message -> the user opening the message (pending technical feasibility) 

## Objectives + Key Results
Our team’s OKRs are broken out into three different categories. 
* Now- what we are striving to achieve within the mobile app’s first release to the app store 
* Next- goals we anticipate once we accrue more information and learn how users interact with secure messaging within the mobile app. 
* Later- future orientated 

## Now
