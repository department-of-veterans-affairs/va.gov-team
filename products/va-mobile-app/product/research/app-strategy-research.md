# VA Mobile App Strategy: *What are the considerations between building a single-purpose vs. a multi-purpose app?*

## Key Takeaways:
1. In many notable cases, such as Facebook and Google, companies have launched apps that mimic key functionality available via their parallel online services, and allowed usage data to determine whether or not to unbundle certain features into independent apps (such as the Facebook Messenger app)
2. At the moment, our hypothesis is that a flagship VA mobile app will likely be multi-purpose, and contain features that cut across benefits provided by both VBA and VHA. It may eventually grow to encompass some functionality in the existing single-purpose apps. 
3. Launching an MVP with a few critical features will help us collect quantitative data usage and qualitative user research that, along with organizational constraints, should help determine whether the feature set of a VA mobile app should be multi-purpose in the long-term, or whether certain feature groupings should become their own, independent app(s). 
4. From a user perspective, this strategy can largely remain “behind the scenes,” and does not need to be explicitly communicated to user. However, we should consider the “flagship” and “multi-purpose” goals when developing messaging, positioning, and findability for this mobile app.

## Types of Mobile Apps
Broadly speaking, there are two different types of mobile apps: single-purpose apps and multi-purpose apps. This document aims to provide a framework for thinking about the type of app that makes the most sense for VA.

A single-purpose app refers to a mobile app that has a very discrete purpose, such as a mobile app that lets you take a picture and scan it into a PDF. This differs from multi-purpose apps that have multiple, sometimes related, purposes. For example, a multi-purpose app would not only allow a user to take a picture and scan it, but it might also include the ability to edit a document or take notes.

While this difference is clear in retrospect when comparing two different apps, apps generally do not intend to start one way or the other. By taking a historical perspective of app development, it becomes clear that these two types of apps developed based on differing user needs and technology trends rather than strategic foresight.  
## History
When the first 500 mobile apps were released to the Apple app store in 2009, many of them were single-purpose. For example, the top free apps of 2009 included Apple’s remote app, Google’s search app, AOL’s instant messaging app and the New York Times’ news app. Over time, some apps became more sophisticated, such as the Facebook app, which mimicked the same functionality that was available online. However by 2014, Facebook decided to “unbundle” it’s mobile app and create a separate, single-purpose app for Messenger. This set off a trend of other companies doing the same, including LinkedIn, Google and Four Square. 

Though the single-purpose “app constellation” trend continues today, there has been a competing movement to consolidate apps in one place, using a multi-purpose app approach. One of the drivers of this consolidation is that users today have an average of 60-90 apps on their device, making it more difficult to manage a constellation. In this environment, there are benefits to a unified user experience as well as advantages to using less storage on the device. 

But despite there being alternative approaches to mobile apps, case studies suggest that the apps do not necessarily intend to start out one way or another. In other words, Facebook’s initial intention was not to be a “multi-purpose” application but rather to provide users with the features they were accustomed to online. Then, by seeing the data that Messenger was used at a much higher level, they opted to peel it off into its own app. Similarly, when Google combined their Places and Locations apps, they did so because the interplay between the two was so consistent that it demonstrated that users had two jobs to do rather than one (ie, a user didn’t just want to look up a place, they wanted to look it up and know how to get there). 

## Context of VA
VA is not starting from a blank slate when it comes to mobile app development and mobile strategy; a constellation of 30+ VA mobile apps exists today – the vast majority of which are single-feature health apps such as Rx Refill or the Pain Coach app.

VA’s digital ecosystem is broad and at times, disconnected. This means there are functions that VA does that are dissimilar from others, such as healthcare and home loans. Providing a centralized app that bridges resources across VA organizational structures, like VBA and VHA, has been a trend at VA since the launch of vets.gov. Following this success, a VA flagship app has the same opportunity to centralize access to key transactions across the VA.

That being said, what will be most important is to measure usage of the app when it is released. By seeing what features users are interacting with the most and what the pattern of their usage is (eg, only checking claims status vs. checking claims status and using the appointments feature), we will be able to determine what the next iteration of the app should do (eg, unbundle the claims feature into its own app). 

## Decision-Making Framework
To facilitate VA determining a product strategy for its mobile app, the following framework can be applied. Note, “jobs” are defined as “what an individual really seeks to accomplish in a given circumstance.” Single-purpose apps exist so that individuals can accomplish one, single job whereas multi-purpose apps make it easier for users to accomplish several jobs. 
By answering the questions below, VA can see whether its app is better suited to be single or multi-purpose. Note that this framework can be applied as the app is released.
| Questions    | Single-Purpose    | Multi-purpose    |
| :------------- | :----------: | :-----------: |
|  What problem is the mobile app trying to solve? | The app helps users do one job   | The app helps users to 2+ related jobs    |
| Are there certain jobs that have heavier traffic?   | Yes - consider spinning off into its own app | No - jobs are all used and multi-purpose framework supports users goals |
| Do individual users do more than one job in the app? | No | Yes |
| How big are each of these jobs? (ie, how much space will they take up on a mobile phone?) | Jobs are large | Jobs are small |
| Can the organization support multiple teams working on individual jobs? | Yes | No | 



## Framework Implications on Launch Strategy
Whether launching an app that is intended to be single or multi-purpose, VA intends to develop and release in an agile manner. VA has also made the decision to start with a quiet release. This gives VA time to think about how it will market its app to users. For example, if the initial MVP is claims-focused but shortly after that VA plans to add health features, the app could be released quietly in the beginning and then marketed more broadly later on. 
For a broad launch, some ways the VA might market the app include:  
- App store optimization
- Ad placement
- Press releases
- Banners on existing VA websites, like VA.gov
- Email/text
- Flyers in VA buildings 
- Social media 

Using these outlets, VA can spread the message that the purpose of the app is to make it easier for Veterans to do quick transactions across VA. As long this message stays consistent as the app expands its feature set, then users will expect the app to be cross-cutting across VBA and VHA. In other words, even if the first broad release only includes a small featureset that is more claims-focused, it is important that the messaging stay focused on the app's overall purpose, which is to make it easier for Veterans to do quick transactions across the organization.
