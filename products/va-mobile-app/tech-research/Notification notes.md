# 8/24 Notes from Discussion w/VEText Team:

## Notes
- App team to prioritize Appointment notifications since VEText already delivers them and has templates for them (as opposed to Claims and General VA notifications)
- App team to determine the mobile app's source for Appointment data (eg, VISTA, EMR, CDW) so team can determine whether there is a potential mismatch with the Push Notification that VEText would send using EMR data
- App team to handle and determine how certificates to Apple and Google Play stores will get to VEText
- If App team can get and pass certificates to VEText, then VEText can register devices
- VA Notify + VEText to send App team the enterprise-wide notification roadmap so that App team can determine if there are any use case overlaps
- VA Notify is starting work on VA Profile integration
- Facilities are interested in sending messages to their populations, is this something the app could do?
- App team will create new Push Notification template in VEText Template Portal
- APIs exist for sending and templating Generic VA Notifications, this is being worked on now but could be tested soon
- PHI for messages = 2 pieces of personal data; security officer has determined 1 piece of data can be sent per message

## Takeaways and To-dos:
- App team to acquire certificates for Apple and Google Play stores (Jonathan to determine)
- VEText to discuss timeline for sending Appointment Push Notifications (Shane to discuss with team)
- App team + VEText to regroup in 2 weeks to discuss whether we can deliver Appointment Push Notifications by November (Sophie to set up mtg)
- VA Notify to send App team roadmap (Paras)
