# [WIP] Creating new test users

## ID.me

Within the staging environment you should be able to go through all the prompts of account creation and then verification by entering in pre determined fake data
I dont have any fake data for you but I recommend grabbing:
- real addresses from random places.
- Update a fake photo
- So after looking into this our team let me know we should avoid using 900 SSNs as those aren’t issued by SSA anymore, Random numbers are generally fine. As long as they’re avoiding 900's, 000 and 666 and avoiding zero groupings (i.e. 000-82-4957 or 826-00-4769) they should be okay

Once you’ve made the account you may notice the name and such comes back as something you didnt enter, this is something that idme does on their own. 

You can then work with MPI (
@Damien DeAntonio)/IAM to get any of the values updated to what you want.
As was stated earlier any other data attributes you need updated you would need to work with those systems to update it. For example if you need a specific MHV state, you need to talk to the MHV team
