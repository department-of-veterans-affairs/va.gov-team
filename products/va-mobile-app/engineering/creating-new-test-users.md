# [WIP] Creating new test users

## ID.me

Within the staging environment you should be able to go through all the prompts of account creation and then verification by entering in pre determined fake data
I dont have any fake data for you but I recommend grabbing:

- Verify account by answering questions about credit history
- Enter all fake name and data, use a real address
- For the SSN avoiding 900's, 000 and 666 and avoiding zero groupings (i.e. 000-82-4957 or 826-00-4769)

Any data attributes you need updated you would need to work with those systems to update it. For example if you need a specific MHV state, you need to talk to the MHV team
