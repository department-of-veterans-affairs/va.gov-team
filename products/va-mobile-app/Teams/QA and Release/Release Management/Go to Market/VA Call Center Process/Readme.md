# Call Center Documentation

## Ticket Template: Call Center Document Update
 * [Call Center Document Update Ticket Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app/issues/new?assignees=&labels=call+center&projects=&template=Call+Center+Update.md&title=VAHB+Call+Center+Guide+Update)

   
## Purpose:
 * Call Center Guide needs to stay updated with any production Veteran facing changes that are made in the Mobile app
 * Mobile will need to make relevant updates to the guide for their changes and follow the Call CEnter process to get it updated 

## Owner: 
 * PM of the teams that are making Production changes

## Help Desk Process for the Mobile App: 
* Veteran calls the main contact center, see "Contact VA" on Home page - 800-698-2411
* Help Desk customer service team will use the VAHB Mobile App Product Guide to do initial triage of the issue
   * Most issuse are related to backend services
   * If its unknown or specific to the Mobile App, then Help Desk will contact Mobile POs and or reach out through Slack  

## Other Info:
 * Ad Hoc edits the document but edits it in Google Doc as we do not have the software to edit a Microsoft Word document - so conversion will be needed
 * Assess what needs to be done for the call center
     * Call Center Guide
     * Meeting with them / demo
 * Content used to handle this but it transitioned to PM ownership with Program Leadership approval early 2023
 * Needs to be done before the release so the Call Center gets the update before the Veterans do
 * Should be submitted no later than 5 business days before launch day, if no response in 5 days you will need to reach out to Contact Center POC
    * HRC POC:  Brenda Torres-Hill (brenda.torres-hill@va.gov) 

## Process: 
* Download the [Live VA Call Center Guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/va-mobile-app/Teams/QA%20and%20Release/Release%20Management/Go%20to%20Market/VA%20Call%20Center%20Process/Live%20VA%20Call%20Center%20Guide)
   * Given its a Word Doc and Ad Hoc does not have access to editting Word documents, you will need to go to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1CSjxUSTORK8MH7NqffA_1aeaMd4xHqZy) to get an editable version
   * Open up existing and create a Copy with updating the version number accordingly if old was 7.2 then new is 7.3
* Modify it accordingly and update the change management
   * After modifying please review the rest of the document to ensure spacing and formatting is okay, if not adjust accordingly  
* Be sure to look to see if other areas in the document need to be updated
   * Example if its a component, navigation, style change then likely multiple images / content needs to be changed 
* Once the Product Guide is completely updated see [Veteran Support/ Contact Center document](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/contact-center/request-contact-center-review.md) for direction on how to proceed
   * You will need to convert it to Word when sending it to the call center
   * Will need to make changes in Google Drive
       * Newest Word Doc version replaces the version in [Live VA Call Center Guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/va-mobile-app/Teams/QA%20and%20Release/Release%20Management/Go%20to%20Market/VA%20Call%20Center%20Process/Live%20VA%20Call%20Center%20Guide)
       * Old Version goes into [Archived VA Call Center Guides](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/va-mobile-app/Teams/QA%20and%20Release/Release%20Management/Go%20to%20Market/VA%20Call%20Center%20Process/Archived%20VA%20Call%20Center%20Guides)
   * Example [32766 ](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/32766)
