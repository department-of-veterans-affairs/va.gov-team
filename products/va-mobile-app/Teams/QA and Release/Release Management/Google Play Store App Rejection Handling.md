# Google App Rejection Handling
Owner: VAHB Mobile QA and Release Team 

## Description: 
There may be times when Google Play rejects a new app release during their app review process. They will send an email to those associated with the VAHB developer portal with the rejection and what the issue was and possible include additional information. 

## Notes: 
 - This could delay the mobile app release 
 - If it goes beyond the release date, Mobile can manually release it
 - User Google uses to login: judy.morrison@idm.me
 - [Google Play Console App Access](https://play.google.com/console/u/0/developers/7507611851470273082/app/4974294731909201030/app-content/testing-credentials)

## Steps: 
 1.) Google Play will send an email to those associated to the Developer POrtal of the VA Health and Benefits App 
    
   - this includes VA POs - Chris Johnston
     
   - Mobile team - Therese, Rachel, Tom, Adam, Theo, Jason C, Jon, Seth, Liz, Narin, Tim 
 
 2.) Ad Hoc Mobile team to review the situation to identify the issue 
     - Internal discussions amongst Engineering Lead, Release Manager and Engineers may be needed
    
 3.) Post about the situation and steps being taken in the [DSVA va-mobile-App](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C018V2JCWRJ) so that the POs are aware of the situation 
 
 4.) Follow the steps in the email on how to proceed 
 
 5.) Await response from Google to see if issue is resolved 
 


## Past experience
| Date | Situation | Resolution | Email | Other Info | 
| ---- | --------- | ---------- | ----- | ---------- | 
| 1/29 | Violation of Play Console Requirements - Google needs valid login credentials for the app so they can log in | Mobile changed demo mode access and identified it that may be the case. Also reviewed Mobile's instruction to Google and identified that we can remove staging information and improve wording. |[Ad Hoc, LLC Mail - Action Required_ Your app is not compliant with Google Play Policies (VA_ Health and Benefits).pdf](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/files/14098841/Ad.Hoc.LLC.Mail.-.Action.Required_.Your.app.is.not.compliant.with.Google.Play.Policies.VA_.Health.and.Benefits.pdf) | [Slack Thread](https://adhoc.slack.com/archives/C02N65QRRB7/p1706534935919649) |
