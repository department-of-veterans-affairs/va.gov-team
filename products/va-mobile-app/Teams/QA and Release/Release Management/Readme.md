# Release Overview 

There are two ways we can update our app:



* **Release:**  Releases are every 2 weeks and include new features, improvements, and bug fixes
* **Hotfix:**  Hotfixes are reserved for major issues/ urgent bug fixes requiring an off-cycle release

**Release Cadence**

* At the beginning of each sprint, a release branch is created, this will hold all code that will make it into the release occurring in 2 weeks
* Issues that are labeled as front-end and have been committed to the sprint are tagged with label ‘Target Release: XX/XX/XX’ (see table below for sprint to release date matrix)
    *  We modify as necessary during the sprint if an issue will not make the targeted release
* Once development/QA has been completed within the sprint, the issue will be updated with the Release date [using the Zenhub Release feature]
* Tickets which have been merged to the develop branch by 10:30 PM pacific time of the previous sprint end date will be part of the release 
    * Example:
        * Target Release Date 12/7/21
        * Sprint Start 11/10/21-11/23/21
        * Merged in dev branch by 11/23/21
* Thirteen days prior to the release, sign off activities begin (See Release Sign Off)
    *  Bot auto generates a release sign off ticket
    * The ticket is assigned to PM release lead, PO stakeholder, Design lead, & Engineering Lead to complete all tasks
* One week prior to the release sign off is due and the app is sent to the app store for review
* On release day, the app is submitted to the app store(s) with latest app version

**Other relevant information** 

* Mobile backend can release as needed those releases are not included in this one
* Release Report will not show all the tickets that go into production
    * Tickets that had code go into an XL branch or tied to a feature flagged will be tagged at the epic level
    * Stakeholders will need to review the Release Report and Epics tagged to see the full scope as to what was released

# Release Readiness Checklist

**Who** :  Product Manager, Design, Dev, QA, and VA POs

**Purpose** :  Define the scope of features, defects, enhancements that will be part of the release.  The process of working through the checklist helps uncover any remaining concerns before features go to production.

# Overview of mobile releases

We recorded a presentation to VA stakeholders in April 2023 that included a brief overview of elements of the release process at a high level (<a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94404065/234997065-dc92c4a0-89b2-4d67-9163-5ab9d1cd94f0.mp4">video</a>), and the release cadence (<a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94404065/234997086-6478699b-1dc8-4165-9e7d-01eb75fc85a1.mp4">video</a>).
