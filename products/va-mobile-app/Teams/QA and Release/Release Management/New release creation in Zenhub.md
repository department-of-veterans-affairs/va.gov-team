# Creating a new release in Zenhub

## Description
VAHB Release Team needs to manually create a New Release in Zenhub so that tickets can be tagged with the release. Without a release tickets will not be tagged and will require a lot of manual effort and time to review tickets and tag them appropriately. 

## Other info 
- [VAHB Release Calendar](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/Teams/QA%20and%20Release/Release%20Management/VAHB%20Release%20Calendar.md)
- Not sure if this process can be automated but recommend reviewing
- [VAHB Release Report](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/va-mobile-60f1a34998bc75000f2a489f/reports/release?release=Z2lkOi8vcmFwdG9yL1JlbGVhc2UvMTAyNzQw)
  
## Timing
- Recommended to create at least one after a sprint has ended
- Can create batch (engineering used to do this) but sometimes leads FE to tag the wrong release
