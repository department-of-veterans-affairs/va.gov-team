# Charles Proxy and The VA Mobile App
First Launch and setup.

## What:
Charles Proxy allows us to see and manipulate traffic to and from the mobile app.

## Gotchas:
We aren’t able to use Charles with Production builds. 
We are able to use Charles with iOS builds from Test flight.
We are able to use Charles with local builds and builds not obtained through the Google Play Store.
You will be unable to download the app from the playstore while proxied.
If you visit a site and get a connection error you may need to disable the devices manual proxy settings.

## Steps:
###  1.) Download from: https://www.charlesproxy.com/download/

* Once you have installed and launched Charles, you will see a lot of traffic being recorded. This is traffic coming from your computer.


### 2.) Go to “Proxy” and unselect “macOS Proxy” and this traffic will cease to be recorded.

* The top of the Charles window has a “broom” icon. This will clear out the calls that have been captured. The red “Record” button is on by default, and is used to start and stop the recording process.
* The two views are “Structure” and “Sequence”. Sequence will show the calls as they are coming in (newest calls at the bottom of the list). Structure will show calls in a hierarchical view according to endpoint.

You may want to stop recording and clear the data that was captured from your computer, to have a clean slate for the rest of the setup process. But hey, your call, I’m not going to tell you how to live.

### 3.) Go To “Proxy” > “SSL Proxying Settings”
When the “SSL Proxying Settings” window has opened, tap “Add” under the “Include” list.
You will see an “Edit Location” window appear.
You can add “staging-api.va.gov” as Host and “443” for the Port.
Or if you want to see EVERYTHING add “*” for both.

### 4.) Go to “Help” > “Local IP Address”
Leave this window open.
If you are Hardwired or on a VPN you will see multiple entries on this page, en0 is the one we will be utilizing.

Now we need to set your device to connect to Charles and install an SSL Certificate (easier than it sounds).

### 8.) See if it works!
Make sure the red “Recording button” is enabled in Charles
Open and attempt to log in using the VA App on your device.
Observe the traffic in Charles
Verify you are able to see the content going to and from the VA endpoints.
If you are seeing failed calls or can’t view JSON or HTML responses there is likely an issue with SSL settings.
