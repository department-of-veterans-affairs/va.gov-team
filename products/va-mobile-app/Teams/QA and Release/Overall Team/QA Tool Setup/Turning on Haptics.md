## iOS
If the accessibility > touch > vibration toggle is OFF, will never do haptics

If the ” ” toggle is ON -and- the Sounds & Haptics ‘System Haptics’ toggle is OFF, will never do haptics

If the ” ” toggle is ON -and- the ” ” toggle is ON, will ignore all other settings (even including settings that maybe it SHOULD respect, like the ring/silent ones?) and always do haptics

## Android - Google pixel:
If the vibration & haptics setting is OFF, will never do haptics

If the vibration & haptics settings ON, and the ‘touch feedback’ slider is set to 0, will never do haptics

If the “” ON and the “” is set to anything but 0, will do haptics (and do its best to increase/decrease the feel, but it’s prettttty subtle if existing at all)
