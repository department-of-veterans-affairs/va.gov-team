| ---- | ------ | ------ | ----- | 
|  Consider having engineers updating / creating detox testing vs having QA do it | Some FE do it today, may be more of a strategy discussion on if Mobile wants this and if not what that means.  | Tim confirmed on 1/4 that he would like engineering to do this eventually | [7540](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/va-mobile-60f1a34998bc75000f2a489f/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app/7540)   |
