# Mobile QA in Q3 2022

## We found bugs
 * This past quarter, we found 47 defects. Of the 43 defects that would have impacted app users, 36 were caught before release (83.7%).

 * Biggest improvement: Our VAOS v2 migration team has found and fixed 7 bugs, and are still working to fix a further 7 bugs (and counting!) before v2 go-live.
 * Cool and unusual bugs this quarter:
 * Nice catch: Tapping “reset” breaks prescription sort by screen (3813) and pagination causes issues with prescription tab views (3863)
 * QAing beyond the app: Mobile doesn’t find military info when website does, and vice versa (3610)
## Always improving
 * Making feature testing easier: Therese worked with a cross-practice group to refine XL testing (getting testable feature builds to QA more consistently and increasing visibility/communication with Product of what’s actively being tested), and is currently working with other practices to standardize UXQA for new features.
 * Automation: Patrick and Tom partnered to get a good chunk of the administrative work for QA automated each sprint, so we’ll spend less hands-on time on routine documentation/clean-up. Based on Raf’s initial investigation, Therese merged a PR with the set-up for an automation framework, on which we’ll build UI and end-to-end tests over the next quarter.
## Better know a QA Engineer
