# Mobile Quality - Q1 2023

## We found bugs
In Q1 of 2023, we wrote up a whopping 150 defects(!).

### Biggest improvement: 
 * We found 81 bug tickets for Nav code, and we fixed 71 of them (89%) before release, including 5 bugs rated at a sev-2. Implementation for new Nav was a full-team effort, so a huge high five to everyone who helped ensure launch is as smooth as possible.
### Cool and unusual bugs this quarter:
 * No stone left unturned: Specific appeal status description displaying string title “appealDetails.remandReturnDescription” (4699)
 * Keeping fresh eyes on long-standing functionality: Some cancellation warnings do not have a dismiss option that iPad screen reader users can access (5053)
 * Testing beyond the app: Due to Apple API bug, iOS users could have an updated app and still see the encouraged update banner (4580)

### Always improving
 * End-to-end UI automation running: Improving our UI automation - to more efficiently reallocate manual QA cycles, remove flaky portions of other automated tests, and catch UI regressions more quickly - has been a desire of the team since launch. With Rachael fully onboarded, she’s been diving into this work and recently demoed the release candidate automation replacement for the military history screen! We’re looking to allocate a little time each sprint toward this, going into Q2 planning, to continue to push forward.
 * Consistency in issue severity: We started using the new issue severity scale on day one of Q2. This is a small win that’s been a long time in the making (Therese gave her first presentation about it in January 2022)! We’ll know it’s working well by how comprehensive and easily used it is by anyone writing a bug.
### Better know a QA Engineer
 * Rachael B is a cyclist, and she’s out racing on the majority of warmer-weather-month weekends. The US road racing scene is split into two main categories - road racing (probably what you’re picturing in your head) and criteriums (done on a closed circuit where you have a set time. The first rider to cross the start/finish line at the end of the time is the winner). Criteriums are easier to manage, so Rachael’s racing split is ~95% crits and ~5% road races.
