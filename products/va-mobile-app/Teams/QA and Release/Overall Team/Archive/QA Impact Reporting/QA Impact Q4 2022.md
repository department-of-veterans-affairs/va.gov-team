# Mobile Quality - Q4 2022

## We found bugs
 * In Q4 of 2022, we wrote up 33 defects. We also closed 32 bug tickets in the last month of 2022, so a big shout out to the onboarding FE engineers who fixed bugs to get up to speed.

 * Biggest improvement: The Rx team found and fixed 64 bugs (over the last 2 quarters) before initial release, including 7 sev-2 bugs (most of them for the many new UI components introduced to handle the complexity of meds lists & data).
 * Cool and unusual bugs this quarter:
 * Collaboration with veterans (UAT): Veterans want the med list to refresh when leaving and re-entering the activity (4327)
 * QAing beyond our app: DSLogon users will do MFA twice to get into the app, with SIS (4341)
 * Newly found: VA appointment request comments not displaying despite being passed by BE (4460)
## Always improving
 * Making feature testing more comprehensive: Therese and the cross-practice team finalized our initial, light-lift UXQA process for new features. Weâ€™ve already used it for Rx (where we found and fixed some visual and content discrepancies pre-release), and for Encouraged Update (which got an all-clear from the UX team right away).
## Better know a QA Engineer
 * Please welcome our new QA Engineer, Rachael from Olathe, KS, a suburb of Kansas City. Prior to joining Ad Hoc, she worked as a QA for a small company doing DoD contract work and did QA work for Garmin. Outside of work, she can be found riding or racing her bicycle, playing video games, reading a good book, or hanging out with her dog.
