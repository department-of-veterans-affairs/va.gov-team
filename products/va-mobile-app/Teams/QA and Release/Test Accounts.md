## Test Accounts 
QA and Release Team will need Flagship App Teams and External Teams need to proactively provide test accounts that have the proper data set-up in order to properly test their features before its released. Please collaborate and consult with QA on the needs in project planning vs waiting till its ready to be tested. 

Flagship App Teams and External Teams will also need to provide and lead the data prep on test accounts if, when needed. Those team's PMs will need to coordinate with QA on data needs. Based on historically engagements, VA Web Platform teams when asked require VA PMs to prioritize the work. 

### Few things to note: 
 - Mobile does not own or possess their own test accounts
 - Test accounts Mobile use may be used and modify by the VA without notification
 - Historically when asking for test accounts or data modification we are told a VA PO needs to prioritize the work 
 - Mobile does not own or possess any production test accounts
 - For login.gov auth code you need to log into the TUD to get it
 - Seen that VA teams need their PMs to prioritize and coordinate the work
