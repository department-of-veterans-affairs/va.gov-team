Purpose: 



| Decision | Date | Owner | Who was involved |
| --------| ------| -----| ---------|
| Design system team will not make any production changes. They will determine work then require Flagship App (Health/Global) to make the changes in production at which time QA will test | 12/7/23 | Kelly & Adam | Kelly, Adam, Stacy during Shared System Huddle |
| Design System will proactive inform QA when planning if and when they need testing. Given the above decision PM wants to limit excess QA time spent on teams without QA. Kelly to reach out to Rachael when needed | 12/7/23 | Kelly & Adam | Kelly, Adam, Stacy during Shared System Huddle |
| Q1 planning, Adam will be the QA Agent for APIs, Rachel for Design System, Tom for Health and Benefits, Therese for Global, none for Veteran Status | 11/27/23 | QA team | Tim, Rachael, Therese, Tom |
| Q4 work, Rachel QA agent for Design System, API and floater ; Tom for Health and Benefits & release testing, Therese for Global, none for Veteran Status. Determined with Tim Wright's approval | 11/27/23 | QA team | Tim, Rachael, Therese, Tom |
| Seth Eheart confirmed that there is no QA / Release or Health / Benefits team capacity needed to support this team at this time. Tim thought that VS will go through Flagship App Health and Benefits but that is not what Seth had communicated. Given his there is no planned QA work to support Veteran Status team for their work or any future releases until Mobile Leadership provides change communication and clarification.

| Adam / Binny agreed to add in an analytical event to the release code after the release branch was cut. Analytics is not tested by QA and given some upstream struggles from the engineering team this analytics it should have been in but was not. Analytics needed to help identify errors which could be done sooner than if delayed till next release. Given not tested by Analytics then no additional action needed by QA for testing.  | 12/7/23 | Adam | Adam / Binny |
| Sprint 86 Release 2.19.0 has been delayed till 1/16/24. This was [discussed internally 12/13](https://adhoc.slack.com/archives/CU2Q76NPR/p1702497682412339) and [proposed to PO on 12/14](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C018V2JCWRJ/p1702558703365609) and approved on 12/15. [Team notified on 12/15](https://adhoc.slack.com/archives/CU2Q76NPR/p1702586255480869).  Intent was to aligne with VA.gov freeze and also identified that resources would be tight to get the release out even if nothing went wrong. | 12/15/23 | Adam & Rachel | Rachel, Adam, Matt, Tim, Jennifer, Binny. |
| During PM Biweekly Sync on 1/3/2023, PMs approved of new MVP requirements - unit test created/passing pre-production, e2e (detox UI) tests for new feature and modifying existing features pre-production, demo mode to be updated pre-production, engineering to validate demo mode changes prior to passing off to QA, and UX team to complete Visual QA approval prior to passing off to QA. | 1/3/24 | Adam | Matt, Alayna, Ameet, Kelly ,Stacy, Tim, Binny, Jen, Therese, Rachael, Tom |
| Release 2.22 was allowed to have code added to it after the release branch was cut, if testing could be done for tickets 7300 and 7485.  On the night of 2/12 the RX test user karsyn stopped working as expected hindering Mobile's ability to test tickets in order to include it in the release and risk RC testing results. This led to pulling the RX Sort and Filter features out of the release during H&B Standup on 2/13.  Global identified evening 2/13 that there are 2 tickets that were held up because of this issue 7300 and 7485. RC testing was going to wait a little to see if the test user issue was going to get resolved by the test user owner (upstream). Decided if RC is going to wait on the same thing blocking the other 2 tickets we would allow it this time. [Slack Thread1 ](https://adhoc.slack.com/archives/C02N65QRRB7/p1707859450264959) [DSVA Slack thread](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/CSFV4QTKN/p1707850179022099). Found that adding these 2 tickets broke detox test as they somehow fixed appt pagination in demo leading to a lot more manual testing than expected. FE had not run detox testing before adding it into the release branch. Given the timing it could not be fixed and used for automation so had to do so manually. | 2/13/24 | Adam | Binny, Tom, Adam|
| [Release 2.27](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C018V2JCWRJ/p1713970161805509) had 2 updates to the release branch after it was cut. 1 update was because of ticket [8448](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app/issues/8448). It was agreed upon to include to recut a new RC branch with these changes by Binny, Tom, and Adam given the risk of the small change and impact to Veterans if we waitd. 2nd change was for ticket [8452](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app/issues/8452). This ticket was originally requested mid sprint to be added by PO Rachel but on 4/25 Rachel found that that VA is holding off a change needed to align to our indefinitely so the code needed to be removed from the release. Binny removed the code and updated the RC branch for testing 430pm on 4/25. Ticket 8452 was reopened and moved to Block status. | 4/24 and 4/25 | Adam | Binny, Tom, Adam, Rachel | 
| Release 2.28(https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C018V2JCWRJ/p1715170218057479) QA found that SM RQ work is introducting a bug into production. Originally deemed a Sev-2 it caused questions on how to proceed. Bug was downgrade to Sev-3 based on comments from Dylan and Rachael. QA required approval from Alayna or Matt if they want to push this change with the bug into producion by 5/9 noon ET. Alayna gave her approval to proceed with this change and bug into production. Tom to test with existing RC branch.  Slack thread (https://adhoc.slack.com/archives/C02N65QRRB7/p1715179514396819) | 5/8 - 5/9/ 24| Adam | Alayna, Matt, Theo, Rachael, Tim, Adam, Dylan, Tom | 
| Release 2.28(https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C018V2JCWRJ/p1715170218057479) QA found that RQ work regarding maintenance windows is introducing a Sev-3 bug which is non-Veteran facing but does cause more error logging in the VA Ecosystem which historically VA has frowned upon. QA identified that by releasing BUG - sev-2 - All - Pre-feature-screen calls on RQ-migrated features don't respect maintenance windows created Sev-3 bug that will cause JWT JSON Web Token errors. JWT Errors are not Veteran facing but can impact VA ecosystem/platform as it will add additional error logging. RQ Mobile PM Matt agreed to proceed with releasing this change with the Sev-3 bug.
