## [Team's Mission, Vision, North Star, Goals and Values ](https://app.mural.co/t/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/m/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/1702388149076/70093f291994d0db5bd76e4891c0bb69074729a9?wid=0-1705082854247&sender=u7ec1ac1ea3bde48882e36908)


## Q1 2024
Team Roles and Responsibilities: 
- Tom - Floater, Design System, API, Release tester 
- Rachael - Health and Benefits
- Therese - Global
Team's overall capacity is reduced  by 20% to make focus on [Team's KPIs, Goals, and Platform Needs](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/edit/master/products/va-mobile-app/platform/Metrics-and-Goals/Q1-Mobile-Platform-Teams-OKRs.md)
   - Documentation Readniess
   - Platform Strategy
   - Establish Metrics 
Each team has their own designated QA resource who has their own capacity that each team can plan for their QA needs 
   - Example has Therese has 15 points for Global then Global should plan for no more than 15 points - wont be able to pull in more 
   - If QA assignee is out for PTO then plan accordingly like they would for their other resources 
   - In the event of unplanned PTO
      - QA assignee to @ Team to let them know and see if any QA need is needed
      - If more than 2 unplanned days then will need to assess how to handle QA coverage   
- Team's QA assignee may pull in other QA assignees as needed but be careful on capacity impact
   - Ex Rachael - e2e; Tom - manual testing ,devices  ; Therese SME  

## Intent 
- QA is empowered to make decisions that control the release and launch readiness of a project
   - Ability to say no or require additional work
- Be cognicant of QA work and have teams plan accordingly vs just flooding QA with work
- Develop consistent guidlines and rules that all teams Flagship and external will follow for testing and release
   - Not create a situation where its allowed for each team to be treated differently  - not going to work long term
- Implement a change, learn and adapt
   - Not waiting for the perfect answer / scenario / edge case  


## Risk / Considerations
- Setting up a process that may feel restrictive or delays release as new steps are needed for Flagship
   - Examples requiring certain things to be done before QA starts their work like adding more MVP requirements means more work required before launch so assumption is launch is delayed
   - Accept that changes won't make everyone happy but long term its for the better good (support by lead managers) 
- Determining who owns and manage the code post release - Rachel (PO) identified and spoke of 1/9 during 3pm Quarterly Planning convo
- Ensuring that QA is involved in early conversations on Flagship teams to help view the end to end experience given their knowledge and understanding
- Making the process to rigid that people can't get through

## Q4 2023  Plan  
 - 1 designated QA resource per team in which each person will attend their meetings / riturals and bring relevant info back to home QA team
   - Therese - Global
   - Tom - Health and Benefits
   - Tom - Release approval and RC testing (for the rest of 2023, 2024 not yet determined)
   - Rachael - Overarching QA person  (design system, API, automation, floating to help other areas)
   - Adam - Release Management
   - TBD - DevOps - currently hiring
 - QA capacity for teams explicitly tied to their QA agent, so teams should plan for this
    - If extra QA is needed Team PMs to reach out to QA and Release PM to discuss
    - If QA agent is out for a day or two likely no coverage, if longer then the specific teams need to discuss coverage options with QA  
 - Team will revisit this process frequently to see how things are going with this process
