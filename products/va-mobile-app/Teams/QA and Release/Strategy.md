## Q4 2023  Plan  
 - 1 designated QA resource per team in which each person will attend their meetings / riturals and bring relevant info back to home QA team
   - Therese - Global
   - Tom - Health and Benefits
   - Tom - Release approval and RC testing (for the rest of 2023, 2024 not yet determined)
   - Rachael - Overarching QA person  (design system, API, automation, floating to help other areas)
   - Adam - handle Releasing once Jennifer transitions off
 - Team will revisit this process frequently to see how things are going with this process 

## Q1 2024
- Believe Q4 2023 plan will continue but will need to revisit based on how all the teams coordinate once all the teams are set-up and maturing
