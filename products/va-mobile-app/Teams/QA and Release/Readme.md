## Test Accounts 
QA and Release team's expectation is that teams engaging with QA will proactive provide test accounts that have the proper data set-up. Additionally those teams will have a process built out on how to modify test account information when that is needed. For external teams or teams involved with VA projects, test account ownership would be the with web platform team. QA will rely on Team's PM to coordinate test account and data prep needs amongst those that are involved.
