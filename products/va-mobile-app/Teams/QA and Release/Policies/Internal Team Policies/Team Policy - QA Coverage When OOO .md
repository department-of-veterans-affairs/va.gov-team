## Purpose: 
Establishing expectation and process for when QA and Release team members are out for planned and unplanned amounts of time. 

Created Feb 2024
Last updated Feb 2024

## How it works: 

| Planned / Unplanned | Number of Days | What to do | 
|------------------- | -------- | --------|
| Planned | Any | Teams will plan based on lower capcity. If there is a critical need for QA then need to assess if QA capacity can be pulled from other areas (H&B, Global, Design System, API, External teams)  to support based on project priotities. | 
| Unplanned | Any | QA taking unplanned time off will tag their PM to see if there is anything critical. Recommend no changes if out for 1-2 days. If longer then need to assess if QA capacity can be pulled from other areas to support based on project priotities. | 

## Other notes: 
- Currently we should first assess if the Platform QA agent can assist in the short term 
- In the event we need to asssess if we should pull QA capacity from another team to support a team need to look at the overarching project priority list
   - Reach out to Matt to find out what that is 
   - If need is not a priority then capacity will not be pulled from another team and work will have to wait until they return
