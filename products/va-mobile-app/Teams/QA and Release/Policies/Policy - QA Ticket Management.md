## Ticket Management 
- **Proactively be aware of the tickets that are assigned to you** 
   - Look at your Github board and tickets at least 1x a day ; Filter by assignee and select you
   - Use Github notifications
   - Use email notifications 
 - **If assigned to you incorrectly, discuss with assign and comment on the ticket new action**
 - **Always bring up blockers even if you are repeating it daily**
 - **Respond to all all mentions in ticket comments**
   - Even if you handled outside of the ticket, update the ticket with results of the convo  


## Working tickets: 
 - **Teams asking QA to complete work must have a ticket - no ticket no work**
   - Ensure the ticket is assigned appropriately, the correct pipeline/status, and has details QA needs
   - If no ticket work with your PM to create one
   - Small tickets <2 QA is working on their on (administrative, other) does not necessarily require a ticket
 - **QA should size the ticket** 
   - Any ticket being tested by QA needs a QA label to indicate the testing effort
   - Labels include 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 - anything larger than an 8 needs to be tickets broken out
   - use labels to determine capacity planning for sprints 
 - **Work with your Team to ensure QA is assigned to tickets early - can be done as early as ticket shells** 
   - Allows QA to see their backlog
 - **Document on the ticket what test account and accompanying data prep, if any, was used** 
 - **When ticket work is moved to QA, QA should attempt to work the ticket within 3 days** 
   - If not able to completed, comment on the ticket with reasoning 
 - **Once you pick it up follow the ticket through till its closed - move statuses timely**
   - If ticket is not going to be closed during the sprint notate it on the ticket and ensure Team PM
   - Examples of why things may not be closed in 3 days other tickets a higher priority, fire fighting, blockers (test accounts / data prep not ready, ACs not clear), started working but had findings that need fixed and have to retest, etc 
 - **Comments are you best friends on tickets**
   - Use comments to put your updates - will be referenced historically
   - Find a method to monitor comments people sent you
     - Email, Github Notifications
