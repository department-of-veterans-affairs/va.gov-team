# QA Ticket Management Guidelines

## Key Pointers
 - QA and Release PM has an open door for any concerns, thoughts, needs
 - Review the Github board daily to see what tickets are assigned to you and what is in your backlog
 - Over document on the tickets - ideally want anyone to go into the ticket to see what is going on vs having to ask someone 
 - If something feels off / strange speak up
 - Timely update your tickets and work tickets once they are assigned 
 - Send back tickets that don't have enough information (details, testing requirements, etc)
 - Ticket conversations to be had in public channels like va-mobile-app-qa and not individual DMs
 - Unable to attend related meetings please decline the invite ahead of time 

## Ticket Awareness 
- **Proactively be aware of the tickets that are assigned to you** 
   - Look at your Github board and tickets at least 1x a day ; Filter by assignee and select you
   - Use Github notifications
   - Use email notifications 
 - **If assigned to you incorrectly, discuss with whom assigned you the ticket and comment on the ticket new action**
 - **When ticket is available for QA to work it, QA should attempt to work/comment on the ticket within 3 business days**  
   - If not able to completed, comment on the ticket with reasoning and move it back to another applicable column

## Ticket Communications 
- **Over comment and document on the tickets to ensure it has all the information needed there in the ticket to understand it** 
- **Slack threads need to be in public channels**
   - Please do not use personal DMs when discussing tickets
   - Post questions and have conversations in our va-mobile-app-qa channel
   - If another team / person DMs you direct them to post in a public channel and you will respond 
 - **When working off hours / days / before PTO - post updates before signing off**
   - Reduce waiting time on figuring out the latest updates
   - Post in va-mobile-app QA and tag appropriate teams
- **Ticket comments are you best friends on tickets**
   - Use comments to put your updates - will be referenced historically
   - Find a method to monitor comments people sent you
     - Email, Github Notifications
 - **Always bring up blockers even if you are repeating it daily**
 - **Respond to all all mentions in ticket comments**
   - Even if you handled outside of the ticket, update the ticket with results of the convo  

## Ticket Planning 
 - **Work with your Team to ensure QA is assigned to tickets early - can be done as early as ticket shells** 
   - Allows QA to see their backlog
 - **Be an active participant in sprint and quarterly planning to ensure QA capacity is accounted for and not overbooked**
 - **If there is not enough information send it back to creator** 
 - **QA needs to size the ticket before they work it** 
   - Any ticket being tested by QA needs a QA label to indicate the testing effort
   - Labels include 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 - anything larger than an 8 needs to be tickets broken out
   - Use labels to determine capacity planning for sprints 

## Working tickets: 
 - **Teams asking QA to complete work must have a ticket - no ticket no work**
   - Ensure the ticket is assigned appropriately, the correct pipeline/status, and has details QA needs
   - If no ticket work with your PM to create one
   - Small tickets <2 QA is working on their on (administrative, other) does not necessarily require a ticket
 - **Document on the ticket what test account and accompanying data prep, if any, was used** 
 - **When ticket work is moved to QA, QA should attempt to work the ticket within 3 days** 
   - If not able to completed, comment on the ticket with reasoning and move it back to another applicable column
 - **Once you pick it up follow the ticket through till its closed - move statuses timely**
   - If ticket is not going to be closed during the sprint notate it on the ticket and ensure Team PM
   - Examples of why things may not be closed in 3 days other tickets a higher priority, fire fighting, blockers (test accounts / data prep not ready, ACs not clear), started working but had findings that need fixed and have to retest, etc 
 - **Document testing in appropriate tools and or ticket**
   - Post release need ability to see what was specifically tested
