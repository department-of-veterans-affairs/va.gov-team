# In-App Whats New Process 

## Overview: 
Proactively make Veterans aware of new features and changes in the VA Health and Benefits app through a Whatâ€™s New UI. Currently Veterans are not showcased what changes were made in the app after a new version or feature is released. This will make Veterans aware faster and believe it will drive adoption and engagement within the app.


## Things to consider
 - Needs to be completed before the release branch is cut for that release. 
 - FE does the implementation. 
 - [Github project page](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/va-mobile-app/features/Whats%20New%20In%20App)
 - Content only for current functionality; expandable alert box component only
 - If functionality needs improved then Flagship App teams need to prioritize the work
 - Analytics to determine if Veterans expand the alert and if they click don't show me again
 - If Veteran should see Encourage Update and this, the Veteran will only see Encourage Update
 - In-App What's New Content may be the same or different from the App Store Whats New content section
 - Teams ideally should proactively communicate these changes to the Release Manager, if not there will be reminder Slacks and follow-ups asking by Release Manager
 - Asked FE to build documentation for FE steps 2/13/24


## Steps: 
 1.) Team is working on a new feature or improving an existing feature
 
 2.) Team determines if the changes warrant the usage of the In-App Alert Box 
 
 3.) Team created a ticket (example [6548](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/va-mobile-60f1a34998bc75000f2a489f/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app/6548)
 
 4.) Content determines the copy and assigns to FE engineer
 
 5.) When the new feature or existing feature is going to be released, Team PM prioritizes their FE engineer to implement the In-App Whats New Copy 
 
 6.) Engineering makes the changes in Github before the release branch - pulls in content that was approved and ties it to the necessary release(s)
