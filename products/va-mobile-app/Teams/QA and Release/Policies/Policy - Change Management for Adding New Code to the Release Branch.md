# Policy - Change Management for Adding New Code to the Release Branch


## DESCRIPTION: 

This Veteran Affair's Health and Benefits Mobile App's policy is regarding the request from internal or external teams wanting to add code to the Mobile App release branch after its created which contains the code the will be included in the release. Said another way, team requests to modify the release code after its created but before its pushed to production.  The QA and Release team manage and oversee the Mobile release process, thus are responsible for this policy and enforcement. 

The evening Mobile's sprint is over the release branch is automatically created based on the status of the tickets. Historically there have been occasions when teams have identified that code was not included in the release branch and may want to add the code into the release branch. This document is the on how applicable Teams will need to handle this request.

At a high level, QA and Release Team's stance is that code will not be added to the release after the release branch is cut. QA and Release Team does offer a process for Teams to use if they and their POs feel the work is critical enough to be added, however this must be done timing in order to not threaten the rest of the release process timeline. 

## RISKS OF INCLUDING CODE POST RELEASE BRANCH CUT: 
 - Risk of adding code that was not properly planned for in the release 
 - Delays to the Release timeline to add new code which increases the risk of delaying or skipping the release
 - Unable to complete QA testing and necessary signoffs within Mobile's Release Timeline
 - Unplanned rework by QA as testing likely was already completed 
 - Unplanning work by engineerings to add the code and handle any findings timely
 - Reducing team's sprint capacity on new sprint to make changes to the release branch 

## NOTES:
 - Mobile release is different than web releases
 - Modifying the code branch is not the only solution others include: Waiting till the next release (QA and Release Team's preference), Hotfix, Availability Framework
 - Small and minor items should wait till the next sprint, this process added to account for critical items which should rarely happen 
 - If modification to the release code is purused, Team PM and PO accept responsibility for the risks it brings 
 - Exceptions can be made if they are timely and also critical enough - they will need to follow the process below
 - QA and Release's QA Tester has the final say
 - Teams need to perform detox testing on  the code they want to include as it could impact testing effort needed to include
 - Ticket for this request is required - [Post RC Ticket Template ](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app/issues/new?assignees=djultratom%2C+bischoffa&labels=release&projects=&template=Post_RC_Code_Change.md&title=Post+RC+Code+Change+Template)


## STEPS TO INCLUDE CODE TO THE RELEASE BRANCH AFTER ITS CUT: 
**1.) Day the release branch was cut, Teams review their tickets to ensure code was in the release branch as expected**

**2.) Someone on the Team identifies code was not part of the release branch cut as they had expected and discusses amongst the Team**

**3.) Team PM determines release branch needs to be modified, reaches out to the Release QA Tester with their request to discuss what is going on, why its needed, options, and timing**
  * Ideally should be done the day the release branch was cut, anything later will impact release timeline

  * Create and submit [Post RC Code Ticket Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app/issues/new?assignees=djultratom%2C+bischoffa&labels=release&projects=&template=Post_RC_Code_Change.md&title=Post+RC+Code+Change+Template) 
    
  * Discussions may also require an updated release timeline to account for this delay in order to meet original PO approval date
    
  * Updates to be made to the DSVA Slack Thread with discussion and next steps 
    
**4.) If Team PM still wants to modify the release code to include new code, Team PM will need to get PO approval** 
  * Release process will be put on hold while we wait on PO approval to reduce rework
    
  * Approval can be included in the DSVA Slack thread if there is one

  * Team will also need to ensure their changes do not breach detox tests - if so it could impact testing effort timing needed to include the work 

**5.) Team PM will provide POs documented approval to the Release QA Tester & update the Release Ticket with this change** 

**6.) PM Team Engineer will update the code accordingly and be onstandup for any testing findings** 

**7.) QA and Release team will test within their means and timeline given and document the decision to modify the release code in their decision log** 
  * If new code leads to findings that prevent QA from signing off on the release; the requesting PM will need to discuss if release continues without QA approval 

**8.) Continue with release process**

**9.) QA to conduct a retro** 
 * Understand if there was any ramifications of adding code post release branch being cut
 * Discuss how to reduce / prevent this from happening in the future
 * Example 2.22 added 2 tickets that somehow fixed appt pagination (7300 and 7485) breaking detox test - tripling manual testing effort

### Release Timing Example: 
| Event | Date Example | Days to Complete | Other |
| ----- | ----- | ---- | ----- |
| Sprint starts | 11/8/23 | 10 business days | |
| Sprint Ends | 11/21/23 |  |
| Release branch cut | 2:00 AM EST Wednesday (11/22) | Teams that submitted code should be validating all code they expect is included | 
| QA Release Testing | 11/22 - 11/24  | 3 business days | QA will start their testing immediately, so release branch change management needs to happen sooner vs later | 
| QA Release Signoff | 11/24 | 3 business days |  | 
| PM Release Signoff | 11/27 | 1 business day | | 
| PO Release Signoff | 11/28 | 1 business day | | 
| App Review Submission Date | 11/29 | 1 business day | | 
| App Release Date | 12/5 | 4 business days | |
