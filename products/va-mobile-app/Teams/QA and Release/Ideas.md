## How we can improve testing and release process
  1.) Require unit tests to be completed before feature goes into production
  
  2.) Require feature flag/waygate on all brand new features - been talked about in the past but not really enforced it seems 
  
  3.) Require Detox UI work to be part of MVP prior to production for new work - reduce QA backlog work and improve testing quality / timing 
  
  4.) Require detox UI updates to be part of new changes before going to production - reduce QA backlog work and improve testing quality / timing 
  
  5.) Have engineering do some preliminary demo mode test before QA - seen demo mode broken or changes not there in QA that could have been caught earlier if engineering did it 
  
  6.) Have Teams assign their QA Agent to tickets that need testing - tickets aren't labeled right and requires manual scrubbing reviewing for each sprint 
  
  7.) Have Demo mode be updated with any changes - this impacts detox testing and manual testing 
  
  8.) Consider having Mobile teams update detox testing vs having QA do it - some FE do it already today 
  
  9.) Create a PR turn around policy for QA review 
  
  10.) Review what meetings are critical and needed for QA to attend vs optional 
  
  11.) Explore the possibility of keeping the last 2 days of the sprint open from QA to focus on just testing 

  12.) Require visual QA tickets that UX needs to complete prior to QA starting testing 

  13.) Make Visual QA tickets required for MVP - push Visual QA responsibilities on UX and less on QA 

  14.) Set a PR review SLA - say a PR is assigned to you to review then have it closed in 2 business days? 

  15.) create standard / process for when there are inclusion / changes to be made to releases 

  16.) Document hot fix process / requirements / timing 

  17.) How to educate / onboard external teams in regards to QA testing, testing requirements (detox, etc0)
