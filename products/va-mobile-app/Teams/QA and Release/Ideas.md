## How we can improve testing and release process


| Idea / Open Item | Comments | Owner | 
| ---- | ------ | ------ | 
|  Require unit tests to be completed before feature goes into production |  I have gotten positive backing from Binny, Kelly and Stacy |  Adam | 
|  Require detox UI updates to be part of new changes before going to production - reduce QA backlog work and improve testing quality / timing | I have gotten positive backing from Binny, Kelly and Stacy |  Adam | 
|  Have engineering do some preliminary demo mode test before QA | seen demo mode broken or changes not there in QA that could have been caught earlier if engineering did it which delays the entire ticket | Adam | 
|  Have Demo mode be updated with any changes | this impacts detox testing and manual testing  |  |  Adam | 
|  Consider having Mobile teams update detox testing vs having QA do it | some FE do it already today | |   Adam | 
|  Create a PR turn around policy for QA review | Set a PR review SLA - say a PR is assigned to you to review then have it closed in 2 business days? |  Adam |  
|  Review what meetings are critical and needed for QA to attend vs optional | Will require teams to review their calendars to list all their meetings and review | Team | 
|  Explore the possibility of keeping the last 2 days of the sprint open from QA to focus on just testing   | Is this something that would be valuable| Team |
|  Require visual QA tickets that UX needs to complete prior to QA starting testing | Instances this is forgotten or unknown if its completed | Adam | 
|  Create a policy on steps to include new work after release branch has been cut |  In progress - shared draft with Tom on 12/11 | Adam | 
|  Document QA work within the Kanban board columns | Understand QA's possible work within each column. External teams can leverage this in handling their own columns. Could be used for onboarding | | 
|  Document hot fix process / requirements / timing | We rarely do this but would like to get it documented if not already | | 
|  How to educate / onboard external teams in regards to QA testing, testing requirements (detox, etc.)  | | | 
|  Release / RC tester for 1Q 2024 | Q4 determined but understood it may not be for Q1 2023 | Team | 
|  New cadence of meetings for 2024 | Waiting till after Mobile team's keep / delete team meeting review | Adam | 
| New ticket templates for items Mobile team doesn't do a great job remember Feature flag (depending on how implementing & releasing), Maintenance windows, Availability framework, Analytics (metrics, audiences, etc), App-review-triggering action, Updating demo mode |  Ticket idea for the future — there are a number of things we need to think about (and often code, but sometimes it doesn’t apply) for any given epic and we’re not great about remembering them.It’d be great to have them in the template so Product (or anyone else in the feature team) doesn’t need to remember them.  | | |
| Improve QA sizing | Past convos forced QA to put sizing in the comments. Revisit to see if this is still sufficient | 
| Should QA have a standing meeting with different disciplines | Ability to improve relationships and discuss cross discipline improvements / ideas | | 


| Closed items | Resolution | Date |
| ----- | ----- | -------| 
|  Have Teams assign their QA Agent to tickets that need testing - tickets aren't labeled right and requires manual scrubbing reviewing for each sprint | Shared with PMs and all of them agreed to this, shared out in Slack thread.  If you do not see this bring it up in your team's ceremonies | Dec 2023 |
| Teams assigned a QA Agent | Therese - Global; Tom - Health and Benefits; Rachael - API / Design System / Floater | Nov 2023 |
| Release RC Tester Agent for rest of the quarter | Tom | Nov 2023 
| Team ticket label | QA and Release | Nov 2023 |
