# VA.gov Mobile Accessibility Testing Plan

The VA.gov mobile app development team considers accessibility to be a priority requirement in the design and implementation of the app. The purpose of this document is to outline:
1. The requirements that will guide the the VA.gov Mobile App build
2. The accessibility tools and materials that will be used during testing
3. The testing protocol and steps that will be taken when reviewing the accessibility capabilities in the app

## Section 1: Accessibility Requirements & Approach
The following items are based on WCAG 2.2 and Section 508 accessibility standards, organized by product function. Each item description reflects both the requirement and the referenced standard, along with the corresponding implementation approach.

* Items that have “Design” / “Designs” bolded reflect standards that must be facilitated by the design workstream
* Items that have “Programmatically” bolded reflect standards that focus on technical implementation
* Accessibility standards that relate to non-existent functionality in the app are marked N/A. In the event that the app’s design changes to include relevant functionality, these standards will be candidates to prioritize as requirements.
<br>

| Category | WCAG / 508 Section | Implementation Approach |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Color | Color contrast (1.4.3_AA) (1.4.6_AAA) | **Designs** for the the app should consider the following:<br><br>Normal fonts (< 19px)<ul><li>AA compliant: 4.5:1</li><li>AAA compliant: 7:1</li></ul>Large fonts (19px +)<ul><li>AA compliant: 3:1</li><li>AAA compliant: 4.5:1</li></ul>  |
| Color | Color (1.4.1_A) | **Designs** for the app should not use color as the sole conveyance of information. |
| Color | Non-text contrast (1.4.11_AA) | **Designs** of UI components and graphical objects in the app designs that are used to understand the content should have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. |
| Headings & Navigation | Heading levels (1.3.1_A) | **Designs** for each page should have a single h1 and additional headings (h2 - h6) for each section of the page.<br><br>There are no skipped heading levels. (i.e. the headings don't jump from h1 to h>).<br><br>**Programmatically** specify ARIA level for all text headings in React Native. |
| Headings & Navigation | Info and Relationships (1.3.1_A) (502.3.7) (502.3.8) | Leverage React Native accessible components so that information, structure, and relationships conveyed through presentation can be **programmatically** determined or are available in text. |
| Headings & Navigation | Tables (1.3.1_A) (502.3.3) | All tables should be **programmatically** identified and the table heading for applicable rows and columns should be announced.<br><br>N/A: There are currently no complex tables in the designs. If we need to pull in a fancier table than what we can build with react native list views, then we may need to pull in a third party library that is accessible and meets the designs. |
| Headings & Navigation | Lists (1.3.1_A) | Leverage React Native accessible list component so lists can be **programmatically** determined. |
| Headings & Navigation | Page title (2.4.2_A) | Each page on the app should **programmatically** have a unique title that is descriptive and differentiated.<br><br>React Native may provide libraries that facilitate this. |
| Headings & Navigation | Headings and labels (2.4.6_AA) | Headings and labels should describe the topic or purpose and be **programmatically** determined as such. |
| Headings & Navigation | Navigation consistency (3.2.3_AA) | **Designs** for navigation mechanisms that are repeated across several pages should be consistent. (Color, icon, text, location, etc.) |
| Headings & Navigation | Sensory characteristics (1.3.3_A) (502.3.8) | **Designs** for pages should not require sensory characteristics such as shape, color, size, visual location, orientation, or sound to be understood or operable. |
| Headings & Navigation | Bypass Blocks (Skip nav) (2.4.1_A) (c205.2.2) | Provide a means of skipping repeating content (e.g. headers, navigation, bars, etc.).<br><br>N/A according to section 508 (c205.2.2) and no such navigation exists in the app. |
| Headings & Navigation | Link purpose in context (2.4.4_A) | **Design** so that the purpose of each link can be determined by its text (e.g. "Schedule your appointment now") or the context it's surrounded by (e.g. "There are a lot of ways to stay active during the pandemic.").<br><br>"Click / tap here" should never be used. |
| Headings & Navigation | Multiple ways to reach each page (2.4.5_AA) (c205.2.2) | Provide more than one way to access content (minimum two ways).<br><br>N/A according to section 508 (c205.2.2) since this is a non-web format. |
| Non-text content & media  | Text alternatives (1.1.1_A) | Provide text alternatives for any non-text content (e.g. images, non-decorative icons, etc.) so that it can be read by a screen reader or translated into large print, braille, speech, symbols or simpler language. |
| Non-text content & media  | Text alternatives for audio-only and video-only content (1.2.1_A) | Content / API should provide text alternatives for all audio and video content.<br><br>N/A – No such content exists in the app. |
| Non-text content & media | Audio descriptions (1.2.5_AA) (503.4.2) | Audio descriptions should be provided for all pre-recorded video content.<br><br>N/A – No such content exists in the app. |
| Non-text content & media  | Video & live video captions (1.2.2_A & 1.2.4_AA) (503.4.1) | Content / API should provide captions for pre-recorded and live video content.<br><br>N/A – Use native audio / video player from OS if needed and possible. |
| Non-text content & media  | Audio controls (1.4.2_A) (503.4) | **Design** so that all audio content has a mechanism to start, stop and adjust volume independent of the system.<br><br>N/A – Use native audio / video player from OS if needed and possible. |
| Non-text content & media  | Pause, stop, hide - Video & animation controls (2.2.2_A) | **Design** so that all media content has a mechanism to start, stop and hide.<br><br>N/A – Use native audio / video player from OS if needed and possible. |
| Non-text content & media  | Flashing content (2.3.1_A) | **Designs** should not include content or UI elements that flash more than 3 times per second. Avoid flashing content altogether, if possible. |
| Non-text content & media  | Label in name (2.5.3_A) (502.3.6) | **Design** UI components with a visual label and ensure that the label is **programmatically** available in the beginning of the name of the component. |

| Non-text content & media  | Form error identification (3.3.1_A) | Leverage React Native accessible form components so that any errors in filling out a form should be designed descriptive, clearly visible and read **programmatically**. |
| Non-text content & media  | Input triggers (3.2.2_A) | **Designs** for the app when changing an input should not cause major changes in page content (i.e. forewarn users if their context will change based on their input). |
| Non-text content & media  | Form error suggestions (3.3.3_AA) | **Designs** for the app should include error messages that include suggestions on how to fix the error. Leverage React Native accessible form components so suggestions can be read **programmatically**. |
| Non-text content & media  | Legal, financial and data error prevention (3.3.4_AA) | **Designs** for the app should enable users to be able to reverse, check or confirm inputs for important data. |
| Text content  | Meaningful reading order (1.3.2_A) | **Designs** for the app should make sure everything is read in an order that makes sense and is programmatically read. |
| Text content  | Images of text (1.4.5_AA) (502.3.8) | **Designs** should not use images that are purely text, unless its visual style cannot be accomplished via styled text (e.g. logo text). |
| Text content  | Text spacing (1.4.12_AA) | **Design** and set up text styles so that:<ul><li>Line height / spacing is at least 1.5 times the font size</li><li>Paragraph spacing is at least 2 times the font size</li><li>Letter spacing is at least 0.12 times the font size for serif and slab-serif fonts</li><li>Word spacing is at least 0.16 times the font size for serif and slab-serif fonts</li> |
| Text content  | Text Resizing (1.4.4_AA) | **Design** so that it’s possible to resize content significantly (ideally to the max device size).<br><br>**Programmatically**, all fonts should scale with the font scaling the user has set in the OS. |
| Text content | Redundant Entry (3.3.7_A) | **Design** so that information previously entered by or provided to the user that is required to be entered again in the same process is either:<ul><li>auto-populated, or</li><li>available for the user to select.</li></ul>Except when:<ul><li>re-entering the information is essential,</li><li>the information is required to ensure the security of the content, or</li><li>previously entered information is no longer valid.</li></ul><br>N/A – No such content exists in the app. |
| Miscellaneous  | Content on Hover or Focus (1.4.13_AA) | **Programmatically** ensure that where content is suddenly visible, then not visible (e.g. a tool-tip) newly shown content is dismissible, hoverable and persistent. This specifically refers to actions that remove pointer hover or when the keyboard focus triggers additional content. |
| Miscellaneous | Focus Appearance (2.4.13_AAA) | **Programmatically** ensure that when the focus indicator is visible, an area of the focus indicator meets all the following:<br><ul><li>is at least as large as the area of a 2 CSS pixel thick perimeter of the unfocused component or sub-component, and</li><li>has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 between the same pixels in the focused and unfocused states</li></ul>Exceptions:<ul><li>The focus indicator is determined by the user agent and cannot be adjusted by the author, or</li><li>The focus indicator and the indicator's background color are not modified by the author.</li></ul><br>N/A due to exceptions (focus indicators are determined by the OS in the app). |
| Miscellaneous | Focus Not Obscured (2.4.11_AAA) | **Programmatically** ensure that when a UI component receives focus, no part of the component is hidden by author-created content (e.g. the footer navigation bar). |
| Miscellaneous  | Reflow (1.4.10_AA) | **Programmatically** ensure that content doesn't require horizontal scrolling when resizing. |
| Miscellaneous  | Time limits (2.2.1_A) | **Programmatically** ensure that time limits set by the content must be able to be turned off, adjusted, extended, or be longer than 20 hours. If the time limit is essential to the experience, then it is exempt. |
| Miscellaneous  | Status Messages (4.1.3_A) (502.3.14) | **Programmatically** ensure that users are aware of status changes by declaring status messages through roles or properties. For instance, ensuring that "invalid entry", "saved", or "submitted" is communicated to the user.<br><br>**Design** should also communicate a change in status. |
| Miscellaneous | Dragging Movements (2.5.7_AA) | **Programmatically** ensure that all functionality that uses a dragging movement for operation can be achieved by a single pointer without dragging, unless dragging is essential or the functionality is determined by the user agent and not modified by the author.<br><br>For example, a map should allow users to drag the view of the map around, and the map has up/down/left/right buttons to move the view as well.<br><br>**Design** should also avoid creating components where dragging is required. |
| Miscellaneous | Consistent Help (3.2.6_A) | **Design** should ensure that if any of the following help mechanisms exist and those mechanisms are repeated on multiple screens, they occur in the same relative order to other screen content, unless a change is initiated by the user:<ul><li>Human contact details;</li><li>Human contact mechanism;</li><li>Self-help option;</li><li>A fully automated contact mechanism.</li></ul><br>N/A – No such content exists in the app. |
| Miscellaneous | Accessible Authentication (Enhanced) (3.3.8_AAA) | **Programmatically** ensure that a cognitive function test (e.g. remembering a password or solving a puzzle) is not required for any step in an authentication process unless that step provides at least one of the following:<ul><li>Another authentication method that does not rely on a cognitive function test.</li><li>A mechanism is available to assist the user in completing the cognitive function test.</li></ul>  |
| Device specific  | Target Size (2.5.5_AAA) | **Design** should ensure that target pointer / touch inputs are at least 44px by 44px.<br><br>**Programmatically**, React Native accessible components on tap targets will be leveraged. |
| Device specific  | Device orientation (1.3.4_AA) | **Design** should ensure that the UI supports portrait and landscape mode. |
| Device specific  | Pointer gestures (2.5.1_A) (503.2) | **Design** so that no inputs require gestures and are possible with taps. All functionality that uses multipoint or path-based gestures for operation can be operated with a single pointer without a path-based gesture, unless a multipoint or path-based gesture is essential.<br><br>Assumption: The only feature that will not have a tap-based alternative is scrolling, and this can be supported by platform capabilities.<br><br>Both platforms have alternatives available to perform simple gestures (e.g. iOS has Assistive Touch built in.) |
| Device specific  | Pointer cancelation (2.5.2_A) | **Programmatically** ensure that for functionality that can be operated using a single pointer (or tap), at least one of the following is true:<ul><li>The down-event of the pointer is not used to execute any part of the function;</li><li>Completion of the function is on the up-event, and a mechanism is available to abort the function before completion or to undo the function after completion;</li><li>The up-event reverses any outcome of the preceding down-event;</li><li>Completing the function on the down-event is essential.</li></ul>  |
| Device specific  | Motion Actuation (2.5.4_A) | For a feature that requires device motion (e.g. Face ID), **design** an alternative way to use that feature that doesn't require device motion.<br><br>Assumption: A login username and password field is an alternative for Face ID. We are also assuming that taking a picture for document upload is an essential function that can’t be done in an alternative way. |
| Code | Page language (3.1.1_A) | The default human language of the app should be **programmatically** determined. |
| Code | Name, role, value (4.1.2_A) (502.3.1) (502.3.2) (502.3.4) (502.3.5) (502.3.14) | All custom UI components (e.g. form elements, links, components, etc.) should **programmatically** have a name, role and value.<br><br>**Design** and the accessibility specialist should work with engineering to determine the best name for custom components. |
| Keyboard | Keyboard focus visibility (2.4.7) (502.3.12) | **Programmatically** ensure that a keyboard will be supported by OS capabilities.<br><br>If an element is in focus, it should be clearly visible that it is. |
| Keyboard | Keyboard focus order (2.4.3_A) (502.3.10) | The tab order should make logical sense. All focusable elements should be read aloud by a screen reader.<br><br>The tab order cannot be **programmatically** adjusted through React Native as it does not support indexing, therefore the tab order will be dependent on the visual order. However, we could index components using AccessibilityLabel over the indexes of the map over an array of data. |
| Keyboard | Keyboard access (2.1.1_A) (502.3.11) (502.3.13) | **Programmatically** ensure that a keyboard will be supported by OS capabilities.<br><br>All functionality of the content should be operable when using a keyboard. |
| Keyboard | Keyboard traps (2.1.2_A) (502.3.13) | **Programmatically** ensure that a keyboard will be supported by OS capabilities.<br><br>Content should not “trap” keyboard focus (i.e. provide ways to exit modals and widgets using the keyboard). |
| Keyboard | Character Key Shortcuts (2.1.4_A) | **Programmatically** ensure that a keyboard will be supported by OS capabilities.<br><br>Keyboard shortcuts must be able to be turned off, remapped or active only if the component is in focus. |
| Keyboard | Focus triggers (3.2.1_A) | **Programmatically** ensure that a keyboard will be supported by OS capabilities.<br><br>Changing focus should not trigger any unexpected changes to page content. |

## Section 2: Test Environment

### Device Matrix

The MVP will support both iOS and Android devices. Since there is a variance between accessibility capabilities across operating systems, one device will be manually tested from each platform.

These devices will be selected from the Device Matrix based on availability during the development cycle. Specific devices from the device matrix may be used depending on the test case. For instance, when testing text / content resizing capabilities, devices with a smaller screen size should be prioritized.

While additional configurations may exist on other devices (i.e. non-Samsung Android devices), these settings are likely to be driven by personal user preferences and to go beyond fundamental platform accessibility capabilities.

### Test Tools
Multiple testing tools will be used to ensure adequate testing coverage. Where possible, platform specific assistive technology will be used to inspect accessibility properties that manifest differently across platforms.
* Voiceover (iOS) and Talkback (Android) will be used to test Screen Reader capabilities
* Bluetooth keyboards<sup>*</sup> will be used to test keyboard operability.
    * The type of bluetooth keyboard will be confirmed once devices are procured.
* Deque mobile app testing for iOS and Android may be used to audit the app as a comprehensive set of functionality is developed.
* If needed, the results of the full app scan will be shared with the 508 Office nearing the end of the development cycle.

<br>

## Section 3: Testing Protocol
This testing protocol will be used to guide the testing process. This testing plan may be adjusted in cases where a requirement has been de-prioritized or is determined to be unfeasible for MVP.
