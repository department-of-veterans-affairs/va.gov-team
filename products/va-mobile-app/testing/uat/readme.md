# User Acceptance Testing

Last Updated April 27, 2021

## Goals of pre-launch UAT
The mobile app has a big scope that cuts across features from VA.gov and My HealtheVet and across benefits, health care, and other engagement with VA like viewing and editing the VA.gov profile. This scope of our app and this round of UAT also includes signing in. Our primary goal in conducting pre-launch UAT is to ensure data is displaying accurately and our features are usable and working as expected.

### We will do both internal and external UAT

- **Internal UAT:** We will talk to ~15 people at VA and Ad Hoc who have their own identity proofed (LOA3) credentials. We will run sessions with them prior to Perigean sessions. The only criteria we need these participants to meet is having their own LOA3 credentials -- we will UAT what we can with them based on their data. Tentative dates: April 23 - up until launch in June. As of 5/6/21 we have spoken with 7 people and plan to speak to 1-2 more people per week until launch.  

We are keeping track of **Internal pre-launch UAT** in [this ZenHub ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/20511). 


- **External UAT:** We will recruit formally via Perigean following more specific criteria, like using VA benefits and health care and spanning credential types. We will do this after we have completed internal UAT and remediated big issues we found in internal UAT. Tentative dates: May 24 - May 28. 

We are keeping track of **External pre-launch UAT** in [this ZenHub ticket](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/va-mobile-app-5f205eac3155a2000f422ecb/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/24111).
