# User Acceptance Testing

Last Updated May 19, 2021

## Goals of pre-launch UAT
The mobile app has a big scope that cuts across features from VA.gov and My HealtheVet and across benefits, health care, and other engagement with VA like viewing and editing the VA.gov profile. This scope of our app and this round of UAT also includes signing in. Our primary goal in conducting pre-launch UAT is to ensure data is displaying accurately and our features are usable and working as expected. 

## Decision: We will focus on data accuracy 
We will not be testing the completion of tasks (i.e. things like sending a Secure Message, uploading a file to a claim, editing Profile information, and canceling an Appointment are not things we are specifically asking participants to do). We will focus on testing sign in and if data is displaying accurately and as expected across the scope of the app. 

## Decision: We will do both internal and external UAT

- **Internal UAT:** We conducted sessions with 13 people at VA and Ad Hoc who had their own identity proofed (LOA3) credentials. We ran sessions from April 23-May 18. The only criteria we asked these participants to meet was having their own LOA3 credentials. 

  - We kept track of **Internal pre-launch UAT** in [this ZenHub ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/20511). 
  - [Internal UAT Summary](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/testing/uat/internal-uat-summary.md).


- **External UAT:** We will recruit formally via Perigean following more specific criteria, like using VA benefits and health care and spanning credential types. We will do this after we have completed internal UAT and remediated big issues we found in internal UAT. Dates: May 24 - May 27. 

  - We are keeping track of **External pre-launch UAT** in [this ZenHub ticket](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/va-mobile-app-5f205eac3155a2000f422ecb/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/24111).
