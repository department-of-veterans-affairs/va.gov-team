## Distribution
We are using Google Play for Android and Test Flight for iOS. We will add participants before sessions via email and set up the app during sessions. Ashley is the designated person to help troubleshoot distribution issues.

## Note taking
We will not be recording, and will take a thorough approach to note taking to document issues and bugs. We will have 2 dedicated note takers per session: 1 person logging each item as pass or fail, and 1 person writing other notes.

## Observing
We will follow the usual observing rules and post reminders of observer instructions before each session. We will designate a backend observer as someone who might come off mute and participate in the session, and we will introduce them by name at the beginning of each session. The backend engineer observer should feel empowered to speak up to ask for detail on an issue they are observing. And given the many steps of set up and large scope of the app in these sessions, it will be helpful to take a team approach and for the moderator to have support on the line. 

Ashley, Bridget, Melissa, or Jen may help with distribution related issues if we run into them.


## Issue tracking approach 

|  Task 	|  Owners 	|   
|---	|---	|
| Add bugs and issues description & expected behavior to internal Google Sheet 	|  Note takers as point people, all session observers should add bugs/issues they notice. We will aim to do this during/directly after each session. 	| 
| Determine sizing and severity of issues and bugs 	|   Team to complete together in daily end of day syncs from 5/24-27 (scheduled from 4-4:15 ET)	|
