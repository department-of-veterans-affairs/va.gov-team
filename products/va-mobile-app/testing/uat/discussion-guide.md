# Discussion Guide for Mobile App MVP UAT
## Introduction & Logistics (5 minutes)
Thank you for joining us today. My name is [Bridget/Jen/Melissa] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. The VA has built a mobile app, and today I’d like to test it with you to ensure that you can sign in and see your information correctly. 
- Since the app is not yet launched, it's not yet in the app store where you might typically download an app. So you are able test the app on your own phone during our conversation today, I will walk you through set up steps. 
    - I don't expect that you have done this before, and I can walk you through each step via screen share.

Do you have any questions so far?

- Once the app is up and running, I will ask you to sign in using your own username and password. I expect setting up the app and signing in to take a lot of our time today, and I appreciate your patience working through these steps with me in advance.

Does this all sound ok so far?

Great. Before we start, there are a few more things I want to mention:

- Our conversation should take a little under an hour.
- We’re going to ask you to download and install an app on your phone.
- I will not be offended by any opinions you express - please be as honest as you feel comfortable being. My goal is to help VA build the most useful, usable mobile app we can.  Although the main goal today is to verify the app is showing correct information, we will have time at the end and I want to hear any feedback you have.
- I'm going to ask you to share your screen with me, and sign in using your username and password. 
    - Do you have your username and password ready to sign in? 
        - If not, can you access them quickly?
- When you are signed into the app, it will display your Appointment, Secure Messaging, Claims and Appeal, and VA.gov Profile information if you have it. I will ask you to navigate to different sections of the app to ensure data you may have in these areas is loading as expected. For example, I will ask you to do things like confirm that your personal information like date of birth, your Direct Deposit information, or things like your Secure Messages are correct. And since you will be sharing your phone we may see other personal things like other app notifications you have set (for example if you get any text messages and your email). 
    - Are you comfortable sharing your screen with your personal information such as (birth date, address, health info) on it today with us on this call? 
    - Do you have any questions about this?
- If for any reason and at any time you change your mind and want to stop the session, please let me know. This is a voluntary session, and you can stop at any time.
- Lastly, I would like to record our conversation. We ask to record because it allows us to go back after our call and confirm that we have captured what you have said accurately. The recordings are not shared with anyone outside of this call, and we delete them a few weeks after the session. As I mentioned earlier, I will have you share your screen at various times and ask you to show us how you manage benefits online. This means that the information on your screen would be part of the recording. 
    - Do you have any questions about this?
    - Are you ok if we record today?
        - If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more. 

Those are all the logistics. Do you have any questions for me before we get started?

## Tech Set Up (10 minutes)
### Screen share set up
I'd now like to walk you through how to share your screen with me via Zoom from your device:
- When you are inside the Zoom application on your phone, you'll see a few buttons at the bottom. Starting at the left, you'll see Audio, Video, Share Content (green button in the middle of the screen), Participants, and lastly on the far right hand side, three dots labelled More.
- If you tap on those dots labelled more on the far right, you'll also see a function called "Chat".
- If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the icons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap anywhere on the screen and they'll show up again.
- The ones that will be important for us today are "Chat" and "Share Content." Any questions?

Now I'd like you to share your screen with me!
- Tap on the arrow that says "Share content". A menu should come up with options of what to share - please hit "Screen".
- You should be prompted with an option to select what you'd like to share - please select "Zoom" and then "Screen". Then select "Start Broadcast".
- If you see any additional prompts please read them aloud and I will help.
- Ok, tap anywhere on the screen to go back to the Zoom application.
- Great, now I can see your phone screen! Thank you for your patience in figuring this out with me so we can look at a app together today.

### App set up
#### TestFlight: Use if the participant is using an iPhone

I can walk you through setting up the app on your iPhone. As a heads up, I will ask you to navigate to see your email inbox as part of this process. 

- First, we need to send an email to you to invite you to test. I have sent an invitation to the email address [participant’s email address]. Do you have access to that email address on your phone right now? 
- Next, download the Test Flight app via the App Store. We have invited you to test the app using the app Test Flight. 
- Great. Please go to your [email address] inbox. 
- Then, open the email from “TestFlight” with the subject line “US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has invited you to test VA Mobile App”. You should see a link that you can click that should download and launch the app.
- You should see VA Mobile and be able to open the app from Test Flight

#### Google Play: Use if the participant is using an Android
I can walk you through setting up the app on your Android phone: 

First, we would need your email address that is associated with your Google play store account. Is this email: [XXX] the same email address you use for your Google Play Store?

- **[if NO]** Ok, let's locate your email address associated with the account. Open your Google Play Store app and find your account icon on the top right corner within the search bar. Click on the icon to find your account information. [Then follow if YES instructions]
- **[if YES]** Great, we have sent you an invite to your email address. Please go to your email app inbox to retrieve the invite.
- Ok, open the email from "Android App testing-Google…" from Google Play Store. You should see the button that says "become a tester." 
- Please click on that. This button will now download the app onto your Android.
- **[If they are having trouble getting the email]** It looks like you are having trouble locating the email; I have dropped a link from the google play store in Zoom. Do you mind going into the chat button to retrieve it?
    - Link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=us.adhocteam.alpha.vamobile
- When completed testing, you can opt-out by reverting to the email invite to opt-out of the program

#### Backup plan if they can’t share screen or get app installed on phone:
Ok, it seems like we're having some trouble getting the app up on your screen. I appreciate your effort to try though. So we’ll wrap up early. Thank you for your time today, we appreciate your willingness to spend time speaking with us. 

## Warm Up (5 minutes)

### Signing in 
Please sign into the app with your username and password. If you'd like to stop screen sharing while doing this, please feel free to do so. I will stop the recording when you are entering your username and password. 
 
(Optional, if the keyboard hides): Just so you know, the keyboard is not showing, so we cannot see your password.
