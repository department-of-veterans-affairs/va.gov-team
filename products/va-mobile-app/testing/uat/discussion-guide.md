# Discussion Guide for Mobile App MVP UAT
## Introduction & Logistics (5 minutes)
Thank you for joining us today. My name is [Bridget/Jen/Melissa]. To give you some background, the VA has built a mobile app, and today we’d like to test it out with you. We're not looking to test you, but test the app we built to see if sign in works and that your information is displaying correctly. I will be your guide, and I also want to introduce [ENGINEER], who is one of the engineers on the project. They are going to follow along and may jump in if something doesn't work as expected and need to get some further details. I also have a few other colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. 

Any questions so far?

Great, I have a couple questions for you:
- What type of device did you use to join this Zoom call today?
    - If not mobile: Can you join from a mobile device?

- Do you have your username and password that you use for VA websites handy?
    - If not: Can you access them easily? We will need you to sign in with your own username and password for today’s conversation. 


- I am going to ask you to share your phone screen on Zoom. I don't expect that you have done this before, and I will walk you through each step to screen share.

- I will also walk you through installing the app on your phone. Once the app is up and running I will ask you to sign in using your own username and password. 

- I expect setting up the app and signing in to take a lot of our time today, and I appreciate your patience working through these steps with me in advance.

Does this all sound ok so far?

Great. Before we start, there are a few more things I want to mention:

- Our conversation should take a little under an hour.
- As I mentioned we're going to ask you to download and install an app on your phone.
- We are testing an app that will let Veterans sign in and do things like send secure messages, check claims status, view appointments, view direct deposit & contact information, and download letters. To test this we’d like you to try these features out signed in as you. We’d like you to share screen with us here in Zoom as you do this. This will mean those of us on the call will follow along as you view your information. None of your data that we see will be shared with anyone else outside of this call. But it will help us to understand what is working (or broken) before we release the app. 
    - Are you okay with that?
    - Do you have any questions about this?
        - Ok, thank you for confirming that you are comfortable with this.
    - If yes: Great. And since you will be sharing your phone screen with us, we may see other things like text messages or push notifications that pop up on your screen while you are sharing with us. 
        - Are you okay with that?
- If for any reason and at any time you change your mind and want to stop the session, please let me know. This is a voluntary session, and you can stop at any time. 
- Again, the main goal today is to verify the app we built is showing correct information. However, if we have time at the end we want to hear any feedback you have. We will not be offended by any opinions you express. 

Those are all the logistics. Do you have any questions for me before we get started?

## Tech Set Up (10 minutes)
### Screen share set up
I'd now like to walk you through how to share your screen with me via Zoom from your device:
- When you are inside the Zoom application on your phone, you'll see a few buttons at the bottom. Starting at the left, you'll see Audio, Video, Share Content (green button in the middle of the screen), Participants, and lastly on the far right hand side, three dots labelled More.
- If you tap on those dots labelled more on the far right, you'll also see a function called "Chat".
- If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the icons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap anywhere on the screen and they'll show up again.
- The ones that will be important for us today are "Chat" and "Share Content." Any questions?

Now I'd like you to share your screen with me!
- Tap on the arrow that says "Share content". A menu should come up with options of what to share - please hit "Screen".
- You should be prompted with an option to select what you'd like to share - please select "Zoom" and then "Screen". Then select "Start Broadcast".
- If you see any additional prompts please read them aloud and I will help.
- Ok, tap anywhere on the screen to go back to the Zoom application.
- Great, now I can see your phone screen! Thank you for your patience in figuring this out with me so we can look at a app together today.

### App set up
#### TestFlight: Use if the participant is using an iPhone

I can walk you through setting up the app on your iPhone. As a heads up, I will ask you to navigate to see your email inbox as part of this process. 

- First, we need to send an email to you to invite you to test. I have sent an invitation to the email address [participant’s email address]. Do you have access to that email address on your phone right now? 
- Next, download the Test Flight app via the App Store. We have invited you to test the app using the app Test Flight. 
- Great. Please go to your [email address] inbox. 
- Then, open the email from “TestFlight” with the subject line “US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has invited you to test VA Mobile App”. You should see a link that you can click that should download and launch the app.
- You should see VA Mobile and be able to open the app from Test Flight

#### Google Play: Use if the participant is using an Android
I can walk you through setting up the app on your Android phone: 

First, I'm going to send you a link from the google play store in Zoom. Do you mind going into the chat button to retrieve it?
- Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.va.mobileapp
- Web: https://play.google.com/apps/testing/gov.va.mobileapp

- **[if Pergiean email is different then Google Play email]** Ok, let's locate your email address associated with the account. Open your Google Play Store app and find your account icon on the top right corner within the search bar. Tap on the icon to find your account information. Ok I am going to have [Ashley/Melissa/Bridget/Jen] who is on the call set up that email address.

Ok if you can tap the Install button the app will install.

#### Backup plan if they can’t share screen or get app installed on phone:
Ok, it seems like we're having some trouble getting the app up on your screen. I appreciate your effort to try though. So we’ll wrap up early. Thank you for your time today, we appreciate your willingness to spend time speaking with us. 

## Warm Up (5 minutes)
Looks like we’re finally up and running. That was a lot. Thanks for hanging in there while we got set up. Before we get started I have a few questions before we explore the app. 
-  Have you ever used VA.gov? 
    - What did use it for? 
- Do you use VA health care? 
    - If yes: Have you ever used My HealtheVet? 
        - Do you use Secure Messaging? 
        - Do you use VA for appointments? 
- Have you ever filed a claim with the VA?
- Have you ever visited your profile on VA.gov?
- Do you have direct deposit information on file with VA for compensation & pension benefits?

## Feature Testing (10-30 minutes)
Go ahead and open the VA app and tap the sign in button.
### Signing in 
Please sign into the app with your username and password. If you'd like to stop screen sharing while doing this, please feel free to do so. I will stop the recording when you are entering your username and password. 
 
(Optional, if the keyboard hides): Just so you know, the keyboard is not showing, so we cannot see your password. 

Things to watch for:

I'd like to learn from you a bit about how you feel about everything we've talked about today.
### Optional Questions

Finally, can we go back to the Google Play store? Since the app is still being developed I am going to have you uninstall it.

## Wrap Up (2 minutes)
That’s all the questions I have for you today. Do you have any last questions for me?

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on VA’s mobile app and make sure it really works for Veterans like you. Enjoy the rest of your day!
