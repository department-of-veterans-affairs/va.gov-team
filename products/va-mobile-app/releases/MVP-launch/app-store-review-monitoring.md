# Handling App Store Reviews

After the VA Mobile app goes to the Apple and Google app stores, we expect users will review the app in both app stores. Initially, we expect (and hope for) a low volume of reviews in the store, but we expect that as the user base grows, so will the number of reviews. This document anticipates the three types of reviews and provides a path forward for processing each.

In general, the VA Call Center will lead the review and response of app store reviews. Please see the Call Center Documentation for further information.

Internal Process Building:

Step 1: Determine messaging

Step 2: Build a lightweight system of how to respond to reviews

Step 3: Think about when we are going to transfer responsibility from VA Mobile team to Call Center team

## Positive Reviews

Generally speaking, positive reviews will only require a simple thank you. 


## Negative Reviews

Negative reviews on either app store are an important source of user feedback. No matter who is handling the response to the review, the action steps will comprise the following:



*   Note the feedback and pass it back to UX and Product teams, who will triage it and take action on their side.
    *   Ayush will log any bugs that users flag in reviews, and add to the Zenhub board
*   Craft a response with the following elements
*   Thank the customer for their review and feedback
*   Apologize for their poor experience
*   Depending on the complaint
    *   Note that this is something we are actively working on improving,
    *   Suggest a quick fix if the problem seems to be because of user error, or
    *   Simply note that we have taken the feedback to the engineering team.


### Responding to Negative Reviews



*   Phase I: Discovery of different types of responses and ad hoc crafting of replies by staff at Ad Hoc or directly working on the mobile app at VA
*   Phase II: Scaling, with a series of reply templates that will allow for more automated replies
*   Phase III: The Call Center will handle the entire app review response process and report feedback to the team.


## Inappropriate or Irrelevant Reviews

VA Mobile app team (and eventually, the VA Call Center ) will flag inappropriate or irrelevant reviews in the app.


### Apple 

If you see a review that contains offensive material, spam, or other content that violates Apple’s Terms and Conditions, use the Report a Concern option under the review in App Store Connect instead of replying to the review. The user who wrote the review will not be notified that you reported a concern.


### Google 

If you see a review or comment that doesn't follow the standards of our [comment posting policy](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/138329), go to [report inappropriate reviews](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/7318385).
