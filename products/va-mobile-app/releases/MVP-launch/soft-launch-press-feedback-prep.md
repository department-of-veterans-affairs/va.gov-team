# Press Inquiries

We will not be doing any proactive press, but we will prepare for press inquiries during the soft launch period. Leanna is working with Josh Seefried in the OIT Comms shop 
to collect the following collateral:

- screen shots
- press release
- capabilities statement
- roadmap 

Any inbound inquiries received will be handled by Josh's team. Josh and I will meet biweekly to review any feedback and discuss any actions. 



# Monitoring Feedback Outside App

Lightweight process 

1. Set Google News Alerts
2. Every Friday afternoon, check Reddit, major blogs, Twitter and collect any noteable feedback to circulate and share with Josh and/or Leadership (Leanna)
