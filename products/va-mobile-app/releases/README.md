# Release Cadence

There are two ways we can update our app:



* **Release:**  Releases are every 2 weeks and include new features, improvements, and bug fixes
* **Hotfix:**  Hotfixes are reserved for major issues/ urgent bug fixes requiring an off-cycle release

**Release Cadence**



* At the beginning of each sprint, a release branch is created, this will hold all code that will make it into the release occurring in 2 weeks
* Issues that are labeled as front-end and have been committed to the sprint are tagged with label ‘Target Release: XX/XX/XX’ (see table below for sprint to release date matrix)
    *  We modify as necessary during the sprint if an issue will not make the targeted release
* Once development/QA has been completed within the sprint, the issue will be updated with the Release date [using the Zenhub Release feature]
* Tickets which have been merged to the develop branch by 10:30 PM pacific time of the previous sprint end date will be part of the release 
    * Example:
        * Target Release Date 12/7/21
        * Sprint Start 11/10/21-11/23/21
        * Merged in dev branch by 11/23/21
* Thirteen days prior to the release, sign off activities begin (See Release Sign Off)
    *  Bot auto generates a release sign off ticket
    * The ticket is assigned to PM release lead, PO stakeholder, Design lead, & Engineering Lead to complete all tasks
* One week prior to the release sign off is due and the app is sent to the app store for review
* On release day, the app is submitted to the app store(s) with latest app version
