## VFS Teams

Since the mobile app MVP is replicating functionality that exists on VA.gov today, it makes sense to stay connected to the teams that are currently working on this functionality to ensure we are aware of any changes to their data models. These teams include:
- [VAOS](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/265974319dfa35a26f88779f100c7ade50508b56/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling): Overlap with mobile **Appointment** feature, including appointments page and push notifications for appointment reminders
