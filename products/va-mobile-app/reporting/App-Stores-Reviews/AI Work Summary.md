# AI Work Summary
In July 2024 the Mobile team asked the AI Tech Lab at Ad Hoc if AI could be used to cut down the time it took to tag app reviews each month. The Tech Lab felt there was a high likelihood that AI could simplify this analysis and they requested information to train an LLM, including the tagged app reviews from the previous months in 2024 and definitions for each of the tags. In October they ran September’s reviews through the LLM they had created; the Mobile researcher compared those tags to the manually assigned tags and gave feedback to the Tech Lab team. This process was repeated in November and December with October and November’s data respectively. Each time the LLM-generated tags were closer to the manually generated tags. In January 2025 the Mobile team will use the LLM for the first time to tag the reviews from December 2024.
