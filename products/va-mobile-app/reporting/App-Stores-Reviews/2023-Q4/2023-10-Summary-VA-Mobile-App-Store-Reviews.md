Works for a couple days and then I have log in all over again, doing the whole rigamarole. It could work for a couple hours, boom log in again. Worked for a couple days, log in again. This is almost as frustrating as Apple asking me if I trust the computer every time I connect my iPad. Security is a thing, gotcha, but for the love of Pete just let me have a “remember me” button somewhere."_                                       |

This app helps you track your lab activity and can also pin specific results but for whatever reason it stopped working in my May 2023. I called Myhealthyevet help desk and the solution was to download this app. However, this was not a valid solution because I still can’t view my labs unless I log in through the actual portal."_ |
