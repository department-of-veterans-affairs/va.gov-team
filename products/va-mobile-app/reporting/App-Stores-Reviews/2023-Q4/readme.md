**High Level Summary**

We've seen a significant decrease in reviews related to login problems. October recorded a high at 90 reviews related to login, which decreased to 38 in November and 22 in December. We hypothesize reviews related to login problems decreased due to the chrome browser fix we installed for MHV login users during this time. App reviews related to appointments, claims and secure messaging held steady, each averaging about 5% of all reviews. Veterans provided ideas for feature improvements in these areas as well as descriptions of problems they had using these features. App reviews related to Rx decreased slightly over the quarter.  

Some examples of feature improvements Veterans suggested:
- Claims: make it easier to know where to upload evidence, provide more information on the claim
- Appointments: provide more information on the appointment visit (location, doctor, deparment's direct contact information), add ability to auto sync appointments to phone calendar
- Secure messaging: ability to delete messages, add message recipients for other providers I visit, provide more time to draft a message 
- Rx: hard to scroll through my expired prescriptions to get to active, make it eaiser to get Rx tracking info and renewals

In addition, app reviews consistently metioned the the app's simple, easy navigation during this time period, averaging 6% of total reviews over the quarter.
