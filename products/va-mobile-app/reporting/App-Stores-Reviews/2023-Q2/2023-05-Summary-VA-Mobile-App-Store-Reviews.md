**Claims and Appeals - 9% of reviews, positive**

"This is the best! A lots more faster & efficient than calling and dealing with the cues and automated menu choices. Getting info on submitted claims faster than mailed results." 

"This app is great but our lives would be made easier if this App would indicate there has been a change to a claim as it moves through the process."

"my claim is not showing up on this site"

**Biometrics and Login - 15% of reviews, negative**

"It never works properly. Laggy and wants me to login all the time even with fingerprint ID turned on. Crashes weekly."

"Maybe the app is down but I cannot log in from my phone at all right now" 

"too complicated to login, and fingerprint stopped working" 

Doesn't work with pixel no fingerprint scan pops up" 

"New update verifies me through id.me then goes back to va app with error message, every time i try to log on. For many of us its the absolute best way to contact primary care providers. Now what should i do?"_

**Errors - 27% of reviews, negative (error is used as a broad tag to note when an app review talked about something undesirable happening)**

"This app is constantly down, offline, not loading, or giving other errors" 

"works but kind of slow"

I read the other reviews and would love to have the great app experiences th he other vets have. Unfortunately the app takes me through a couple of throw-away pages first and then to a screen that says, ‚ÄúPlease wait while we load the application for you.‚Äù Then it sits there for as along as you can take it. It does not move off that screen. Is this an iPhone problem or is it just me?

**Letters - 5% of reviews, negative**

"It says I have a letter for review but it will not open no matter what I do" 

"Updates says you fix the letter problem. Still can't view my claim letter or veterans documents. It just keeps loading"

**Messages - 10% of reviews, positive**

"Great app for managing my VA health care needs it has everything you need right at your finger tips no need to go online you can secure message, refill your prescription and check your appointments all in one place."

**Navigation - 7% of reviews, positive**

"The VA app is way more helpful. Easier to navigate between so many features. Nobody told me about it. I believe that is the only flaw, the VA needs to tell Veterans there is an app. This is very Good. Thank You. Semper Fi, Joseph Rollan" 


**Rx - 6% of reviews, positive**

"The app helps alot just sign in and you can message whomever you want and 9 times out of 10 they will respond that day or with in a hour. Also ordering meds is easy too takes alot of stress off. Thanks a million VA. Always striving to help a veteran and always polite"

**Additional Veteran recommendations for the app:**

**Appointment Notifications**: Wish it had alarm notifications for appointments but other than that , I'm happy with it üòÑ

**Rx, Travel Pay**: Thank you for adding the prescription refill. Please consider including the option to send a request to the doctor to write a new script when it's expired or that the last refill has been fulfilled. Also, please consider adding travel with the option to choose each month separately to file.

**Labs and Tests**: "this one I am unable to find my test results!"

Works great as far as it goes. Has everything I need in one place except Health Info and records. When my VA allergist sends me the results of my allergy test, I get the message in the VA app, but have to go to the web site to see results. Would be great is everything was in the VA app.

**Veteran ID Card**: This app works wonderfully and is very help. Feature request. With IOS, the option to add the military proof of service card to the WALLET app. Could be very useful when showing it any place that accepts it for discounts. Thanks.
