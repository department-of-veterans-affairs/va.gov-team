| Accessibility     | 2               | 2 Positive                       | Thank goodness we finally have a usable functioning app ! This app is far greater than anything else the gov has offered , they finally got it right. I’m a blinded veteran and this app is perfect with very little useless content cluttering up space and making it hard to navigate. This app makes it a hundred times easier to utilize secure messaging. Which after the Va went to national call centers secure messaging is the Cadillac of go to means to communicate with our Dr’s and specialists My congrats to the creators !

| Appointments      | 31              | Mixed / 14 Negative              | This app is great. It makes it easy and convenient to check on appointments and message providers. Thank you.<br><br>Along with all the others that have rated the app so low. I really need the app to show my appointments. It used to show the information needed and a link to add it to my calendar!! I guess it is time to bother my Senators with what could be a minor issue to fix.<br><br>Glitchy, cannot see my appointments Report daily never fixed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Easy              | 22              | 20 Positive                      | It has a great interface and very easy to use.<br><br>Quick, responsive and easy to navigate. It is great having an app especially a government app that is really this great.<br><br>This app is actually REALLY good, especially considering that it’s from the government!! I mean usually you expect crappy knock offs or what not from government run apps but this makes everything so simple. I bet the VA is happy as I am assuming that a majority of the phone calls would now stop. Whoever you put in charge of making this app should get a raise                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Login             | 16              | 10 Negative                      | Can hardly ever actually sign in. When I try it just brings me back to the login screen. It's useless.<br><br>The app is very mid. Everything requires you to login over and over ever after using fingerprint identification. The point of 2fa is to avoid this login cycle. You can renew prescriptions pretty easily which I like. Checking in to appointments is very spotty at best. Making appointments is a no go. Somehow the website is MUCH better than the app.<br><br>I have used the App for many years and has worked wonderful but the update of 3/27/2024 version 2.24.0 the App no longer works. Once I open the App and try to sign in the only thing I get is a blank screen on top snd no where to sign in. Please fix the problem. Thank you. |

| Recommendations   | 19              | Mixed / 11 Positive              | Great app! Wished it paired with MyChart and other common medical platforms though. An Apple Wallet ID card would also be nice. Most importantly, ChampVA is still archaic and operating via snail mail in 2024!! Please port this capability for the full family to be managed effectively.<br><br>Updated: Same questions, newer update: What bugs? What improvements? Please, keep us in the dark./s<br><br>Great app!

Thank you.<br><br>Bugs with ordering prescriptions, such as order dates not updating. Getting the wrong meds refilled through requests. Requests going through only to check back a day later being able to request the same refill. I love the app and how convenient it is but I also haven’t been able to find the report bug button inside the app itself.<br><br>Needs more on the health side especially. We should be able to see lab and test results. We should also be able to track pharmacy shipments at the very minimum.                                                                                                                                                 |
