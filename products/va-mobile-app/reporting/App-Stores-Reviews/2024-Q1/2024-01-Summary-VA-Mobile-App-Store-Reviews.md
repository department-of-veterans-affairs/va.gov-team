Also, the logout button is buried in the settings menu - it should be accessible from any screen in the app."<br><br>"Good APP but is there a way to have a new VA Card issued before my card expires through the APP?"<br><br>"If there were a travel link and access to blue button that would be awesome."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
