| Appointments      | 21              | Mixed / 8 Negative | "I would’ve rated this five stars not too long ago, but for the last couple of weeks, the app shows that I don’t have appointments which is not accurate. The “app support” link listed in the App Store just takes you to all of the VA phone numbers. I wouldn’t even know where to begin to report this and based on how the VA usually responds to issues I’m going to assume they are going to do anything about it anyway."<br><br>"I used to give it 4 stars because no one is perfect. For several weeks the appointments portal has been unavailable.!I’ve had to log into main website which defeats the purpose. I’ve called several times and NADA."<br><br>"Wish they hadn’t changed where only my mental health appointments are all I can see on the app now. Now I have to use the Va.gov website to see all appointments."                                                                                                                            |
