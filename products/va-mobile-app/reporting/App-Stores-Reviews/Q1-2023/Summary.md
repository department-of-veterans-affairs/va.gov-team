## High Level summary

Over Q1 2023, we’ve seen an increase in negative reviews related to login issues and biometric features not working all the time, as well as reports of claims statuses not matching up to the website. Additionally, user reviews related to issues around letter downloads was also a trend. There was an uptick in negative reviews related to Rx shortly after release, but the majority of these reviews were related to users who could not find the feature due to the graduated rollout. Medical records, travel reimbursement and labs and tests were the most frequently mentioned feature in app reviews that are not currently available in the mobile app.

   <td><em>I am a 74 year old disabled vet, and I use the VA app several times a week. It notifies me when I have a message from my Primary Care Team. It also keeps track of upcoming appointments, and allows me to reorder prescriptions. I can also see test results. I even use the app to check in when I arrive for an appointment. I used to spend a fair amount of time calling the VA toll free number to do those things, but now I do most of those things on the app. It works, and it’s easy! Doug C Portland Oregon</em>
