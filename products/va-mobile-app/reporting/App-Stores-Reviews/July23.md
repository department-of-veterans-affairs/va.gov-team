I would give it 5 stars but in the last few months my appointments stopped populating in the App. I was using it to add my appointments directly to my calendar and to keep me on track. With all of the different appointmentstimes and dates it gets very confusing very quickly. If you can please fix the Appointments functionality on the App I would sincerely appreciate it. Besides the appointments the App is outstanding. I use it to see the status of my claims track and refill my prescriptions message my providers download letters and even track my payments history. Once the appointment functionality is working again I would say that this is one ofif not the mostimportant App on my phone."_ |

I now use it from my phone vs. the browser as i can do most of what i need. When typing messages, the message box can jump down and get hidden. There are no medical records downloading or viewing except vaccinations. Once logged in, you can opt in to fingerprint login, which is very convenient. But, don't logout just close the app. otherwise, you'll need to log in again.
