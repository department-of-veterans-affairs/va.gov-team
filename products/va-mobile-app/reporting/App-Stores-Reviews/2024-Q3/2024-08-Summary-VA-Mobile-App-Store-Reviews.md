| Appointments      | 15              | 8 Positive, 2 Neutral, 5 Negative    | "I have been using the app since the beginning of 2021. They have continually improved and updated since then and the updates have been helpful and the additional resources included in the app, such as messaging your actual, personal, local, medical providers and getting real-time responses in my experience on average 10 minutes or less. This is huge in helping veterans with social isolation or suicidal ideations and PTSD and other disabilities schedule appointments and reach out for care without physically talking to someone on the phone, but still being able to reach a VA employee who can schedule all the care needed on a case by case basis and tailor it to your personal needs. . . ."<br><br>"This process speeds up my request for information and making appointments for health related issues and concerns. . . ."<br><br>" . . . As far as utilizing the website for appointments you seem to be stuck between centralizing and decentralizing and it’s not working. Even with the wait time a phone call is still much faster. I tried to reschedule a simple LAB appointment and it’s not even offered as a radial choice and when I tried to locate how to do so I just kept getting the online version of a runaround. Also, the various systems don’t talk to each other. One site shows one status of appointments and the others don’t update when there is a change. It’s confusing. Even your staff say don’t bother it’s too confusing just call instead.

Please roll back this new change."<br><br>"Everything about the app is great, except "the monthly payment" should be placed on the payment page and not on the Front page for everyone to see. The bigger the amount, the bigger the target the Veteran becomes. Please move this to the payment page. Then I'll give it 5 Stars.

Since the amount of time a claim requires for processing from beginning to end is average 3-6 months they should consider upgrading to an even more in-depth system to show the veteran where they are in the process exactly without any assuming involved, the veterans next actions/steps to be done exactly, and a ballpark/estimated completion date would go a long way in improving the attitude of veterans towards the VA claims process. I believe it would eliminate some if not all of the uncertainty around the length of time the claim will be, and the feeling that the claim is not being handled or being given the attention it deserves, both would considerably reduce the amount of phone calls received daily pertaining to claims and status. 🇺🇸FYea"<br><br>"I don’t have the option to mail all my providers."<br><br>"Please include what is the department is or subject. Thank you"<br><br>"The app works great the only area I see needs work is the messaging function. I try to move old messages to the trash folder but can only do that on the website."<br><br>". . . I’m hoping they can integrate the video conferencing into it soon!"<br><br>"Red box with black text. Can anyone read the text? It’s older people have a hard time. I’m in my 50s and can’t. Also why does someone have to fill out a sheet with PII in order to provide app feedback? Ridiculous. Otherwise this is one of the best govt apps around. . . ."<br><br>"I really wish you would update the app.So when I have appointments, you would tell me exactly what the appointment is for who it is with?I am an older human being and need to know this information. I need to know what clinic.What floor name of the visit everything like that. You need to do something about customer service 2 people hung up on me! No reason other then they don't want to work. Needs to be a survey at end of calls so agent can be fired and someone hired that cares about veteran's."<br><br>"One obvious inadequacy of this app is there’s no access to VA beneficiary travel reimbursement, aka BTSSS. I STILL HAVE TO ACCESS BTSSS THROUGH A WEB BROWSER! 😢"<br><br>". . . As a user, I don’t like that my monthly disability award is displayed. Please roll back this new change."<br><br>"Why don't they put info such as what number to call for emergency out of network treatment front and center in the app? Just a big button that you can press to send the required notification. Also why can't the app also act as an ID card? You already know it's the Veteran. The app should be useful not almost useful."<br><br>"The new Crisis Line button makes the app unusable for me. I can't focus my eyes on what I'm doing because I keep seeing the button up there..."<br><br>"How do you set this app to notify you of any new correspondence of any type without logging in several times a day?"<br><br>"I like the app very much for helps with seeing what I need on their the only thing I don't like about it is the new update. The home screen I do not like having my compensation payment being shown when you first sign into the app. Other than that it is really good it helps me communicate to my doctors and other entities in the VA to get things done"<br><br>"Update removed numbers only access code keying and now input are a mix of alpha/numeric harder to enter. No feature to view or pay health balance due or view payment history." |

They where so excited and it saved time because they call refills in all the time. . . ."<br><br>"This app is amazing, it makes communication with my healthcare team easy and refilling prescriptions a snap! well done VA!"<br><br>"The last couple of updates has sent the app in the opposite direction in regards to performance and UX design. It currently has authentication issues. It messes up sending in refill requests. Now there are rx's my pharmacy will not fill so I will be without until the next refill date. . . ."<br><br>"I had to submit a request for a refill 3 times and several weeks before it might actually go through. Apparently, they will not even consider refilling necessary prescriptions, that can have catastrophic negative reactions when suddenly stopped, before the definitive fill date, which leaves the patient both screwed and in danger.
