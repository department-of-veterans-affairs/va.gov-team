| Recommendations   | 19              | Mixed<br>6 Positive / 8 Neutral / 5 Negative | I enjoy the simplicity of the app and how easy it is to navigate. I would love to see all connected disabilities grouped together and non-service-connected disabilities on a separate tab. Additionally, a notification alert to inform users of any changes or updates to their claims would be beneficial. This feature would help users stay on top of their claims and information without delay.<br><br>Man it would be great to be able to contact the VA without having to see the word suicide so many times. It ruins my goddamned week.<br><br>App needs to be updated and add functionality to where you can check into your appointments that show in the app as well as file your travel pay.<br><br>There should be a QR code reader in the app. So we can scan the code on the prescription bottles in order to make ordering easier.<br><br>overall I like having access via an app, however this is not a. all in one app. Still have to dig through multiple links for other VA resources.<br><br>Over all good. "Payment" should show payment history without having to make another choice. Sometimes biometric option does not show on login screen<br><br>Great way to manage prescription refills, message care teams, and quickly check claims. App could use some improvements. Would like to see care or doctor instructions in app. Also linking health data from smart devices would help in veteran care.<br><br>Hello when writing an email to a provider on the top right it has “save” instead of actually a “send”. To actually send the email you have to stop writing the email and scroll all the way down to send it. Doesn’t make any logical sense. Please fix this as it’s very confusing to say the least. As for suggestions please add the following: 1)A way to process travel reimbursements as that still has to be done on the travel website. 2)a way to download “blue button” medical records as that also is only able to be done on the website.
