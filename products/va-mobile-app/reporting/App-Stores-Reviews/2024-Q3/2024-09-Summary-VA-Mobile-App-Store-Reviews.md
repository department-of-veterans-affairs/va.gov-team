| Ease of Use       | 20              | Positive Sentiment<br><br>(17 Positive, 2 Neutral, 1 Negative) | "Excellent app. Now it's easy and convenient to accomplish tasks, access my information, order refills from the pharmacy, see results from visits to the VA, and keep in touch with my ”Primary.” So far it's very forgiving when I got lost inside the app, which only happened when I first started using it. And it's easier for me to back out of problems if I make a mistake. Best of all, my phone is always with me, therefore it's much more convenient than getting to a computer to access the website."<br><br>"Very helpful and straightforward"<br><br>"The site is easy-to-use to use.
