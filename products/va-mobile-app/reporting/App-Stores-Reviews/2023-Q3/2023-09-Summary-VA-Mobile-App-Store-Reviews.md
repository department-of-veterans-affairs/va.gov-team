My only suggestion after using the app for a couple of months is adding a sign out button on the app homepage. Currently in order to sign out of the app, it is buried under the settings feature. Other than that the site runs smooth, and I really appreciate all the effort that went in to developing this app. Nice work!"_                                                                                                  |
