| Appointments      | 11              | 7 Positive                       | It was nice this morning to place my thumb on the home key and go straight to my appointment info.<br><br>"The type of care not noted," so not I to log out, go log into the website, go to my appointments to see the type of care. What is the point of having an app when I have to go to a website to get all the info I need when it should be on the app?

Medications are hard to browse to figure out whether they are refillable or not. The site response is slow even on very good connections. It needs so much more work to even be slightly useful.<br><br>It says one new message when you check it you sign in there's no new messages you sign out still says one new message. You need to restart phone to clear it. Fingerprint log in has worked one time. Tried,several things no help.<br><br>Down often and does not always have correct information. The discrepancies between this and VA.gov and other government websites, especially appointment times, is very frustrating. |
