| Appointments      | 40              | Mixed<br>17 Positive / 15 Negative | Love using the app for my appointments and all things VA. But lately it has stopes working. Is the app having issues? I’ve uninstalled and reinstalled but haven’t been able to get it to work. It logs me in using biometrics the. Nothing I tap on works. I can’t switch to appointments or anything. I’m a person who does 90% of my work on my phone so this app was a godsend. I didn’t have to log on a PC to find my appointments or look up prescriptions info. I could easily communicate with my doctors and the VA staff. Since freezing up I have truly missed it.<br><br>Up until a week or so ago I had 0 issues with the app. Since last week the app will now not give me my appointment list. All it says is "We're having trouble getting your appointments. Refresh this screen or try again later." Neither of those options work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Error Message     | 7               | 5 Negative                         | it’s been over two months, and I am still receiving the “VA app currently not working“ and “you don’t have any appointments” error messages (even though I literally have a recurring appointment each month for one of the clinics). PLEASE fix this.<br><br>This app is very unreliable. I never get alerts about messages being sent to me, and when I see that a claim letter is available when I click on Claim Letters, it says none are available. I have to call the VA and have an agent read them to me or wait 12 days to get the letter in the snail mail. 9 times out of 10 I get the "the VA mobile app isn't working right now, try again later" message.

Whatever you did you did not fixed anything just made it unusable. Please fix it. Thank you<br><br>This app is very difficult to log onto and the app won’t stay logged in.<br><br>Why would you offer the option to remember me on this device and then continuously make me sign in.

| Messages          | 21              | Mixed<br>14 Positive/ 9 Negative   | The app doesn’t show the entire message after you reply. My nurse wrote of an ointment I should get. I replied to her then when I went to look at the message, the app cuts it off so I cannot see what the ointment is. Why are the messages in the app being cut short? Why can’t I read the entire message?<br><br>I've edited this review from 1 star to 4 and down to 3 now. There is no one to contact for troubleshooting, so reviews are the only way to tell them the issues. The negatives are fewer now, but one huge problem is scheduled appointments. It shows that i have none when I have many and also no history of appointments. I've cleared cache, memory, and reinstalled. There are no medical records downloading or viewing except vaccinations. Big pluses are Rx renewals and messaging.<br><br>twice message never went through<br><br>can't delete messages any longer. What happened??<br><br>This app is convenient for some things. It has several glitching issues and boots you while working on typing messages and deletes the messages when you hit send and will log off on its own without warning. If you need to write a message that is longer than a couple of sentences, then use myhealthva.gov instead. That at least saves a draft rather than deleting it all and having to go back and rewrite it. |

| Recommendations   | 12              | Mixed / 7 Positive                 | Why don't I have access to all of my medical records? I want to see my labs and I don't have access to a laptop. If I need a laptop to access all of my medical information, then this app is useless.<br><br>Solid app to check on claims. One improvement would be adding the type of discharge to the proof of veteran status.<br><br>Good but needs more functionally need to be able to pay your copays.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Rx                | 20              | 14 Positive                        | It's incredibly useful for appointments and prescription refills For support with this app, I've had good luck communicating with my local Patient Advocate at the VA.<br><br>Why did I accidentally find this, and was not recommended it by every clinic I wandered through in my local VA? This is a secure messaging system for your providers and nurses. Why is this not saving every veteran in America time refilling prescriptions and consolidating access? This is amazing and thank you VA. I go now to my local VA to show the right people and drop off copies of “how to”.<br><br>So much easier to access my information, get medication refills and see when my appointments are! Love this app                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Travel Pay        | 4               | Mixed                              | This app is helpful but it should include the link to mileage travel for the medical appointments. I would have told the developer that, but it sends you to general va help if you ask for app assistance. The chatbot will not know what I am asking for VA. Help us help you (to help us).<br><br>When confirming an appt there should be link to submit travel pay. I have only gotten 2 travel pay text and I’ve been here 10x. When you confirm an appt it should accept it when you hit the confirm button, however it stays active when you arrow back out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
