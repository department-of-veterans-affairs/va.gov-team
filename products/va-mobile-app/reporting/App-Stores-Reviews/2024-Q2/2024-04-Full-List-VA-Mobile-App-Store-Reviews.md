It has several glitching issues and boots you while working on typing messages and deletes the messages when you hit send and will log off on its own without warning. If you need to write a message that is longer than a couple of sentences, then use myhealthva.gov instead. That at least saves a draft rather than deleting it all and having to go back and rewrite it.                                                                                                                                                        |

There is no one to contact for troubleshooting, so reviews are the only way to tell them the issues. The negatives are fewer now, but one huge problem is scheduled appointments. It shows that i have none when I have many and also no history of appointments. I've cleared cache, memory, and reinstalled. There are no medical records downloading or viewing except vaccinations. Big pluses are Rx renewals and messaging.                                                                                  |

That was in 2010. And, every since my first visit, I have been treated like a dignitary. I can’t afford medical insurance, so the VA is all I have. And… even if I had money,I wouldn’t want anyone else taking care of me. Thank You, from the bottom of my heart.

Being able to communicate with my medical providers via messaging is extremely helpful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

But lately it has stopes working. Is the app having issues? I’ve uninstalled and reinstalled but haven’t been able to get it to work. It logs me in using biometrics the. Nothing I tap on works. I can’t switch to appointments or anything. I’m a person who does 90% of my work on my phone so this app was a godsend. I didn’t have to log on a PC to find my appointments or look up prescriptions info. I could easily communicate with my doctors and the VA staff. Since freezing up I have truly missed it. |
