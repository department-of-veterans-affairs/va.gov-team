Primery care says no to blood work, we will use the one that was taking around 90 ago, I explained that there has been a big change in the meds for the last 45 days SO, how are the 90 days old blood work going to aid us in knowing how it is affecting me now. Sorry, I’m not a doctor but it does not pass the common sense test. Veteran are why we have a USA, we should be receiving first class service. |

There are definitely a lot of improvements that could be made to this app. And the medications side, I would love to have a filter where you could filter out discontinued meds. Another option that would be lovely is to set up automatic refills for any medication you want to do that for. It would be more user-friendly                                                                 |

Healthcare is awesome and with claims you can run into an adjuster that doesn't help you cause you don't have a ribbon he thinks you should have. it's crazy. even when you have all medical evidence in your jacket, if you don't have the ribbon they are looking for they immediately dismiss your claim. lame                                                               |

Add feature of not having to fill drafts before you can save them. Sometimes I have to jump back and forward reading something between my email client and drafting VA message to provider. It would be nice if I didn't have to fill everything just to save it as draft. For sending out? Sure title is needed, but for draft?                                                                                                                                                               |

This isn't the disgruntled Marine in me talking; the VA can never give me an answer. - Get on the app to appeal a disability claim made half a year ago. No reason given for denial. - They mail me a 60 day notice to appeal the claim. - The app, VA on the telephone, VA clinic, NOT ONE person can tell me how to access my active duty records. Those documents that show the injury I had while on duty. The ones I need to appeal said claim.                                                                   |

I've utilized the Washington DC VA, the VA at the Beaufort Naval Hospital, as well as the Tomah VA.

I recommend the VA to every veteran I meet.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

I'm redirected to sign into my account, over and over, again. The only way to access my account is via the internet engine. This, too, gives me issues on the Android phone. I have to use my laptop from this point forward.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
