It’s easy to navigate to the point on what I need. Thank you 🙏🫡<br><br>Lots of data but hard to find what you are looking for. Trying to locate specific account information like amount owed or recent medical visits/results is not easy to navigate to using this app.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

I’ve called numerous times for help, and I haven’t received any..Frustrating to say the least..<br><br>The buttons within the app don’t work. Want to click submit? Can’t do that. Want to hit cancel to go back, nope it won’t let you do that either. Worthless.<br><br>I love the app when it is working. Many times it goes rogue and it's not working at all.<br><br>Spotty program.

| Recommendations   | 12              | 7 Positive             | It would be nice to see labs, test results, and also procedures in the application instead of having to go to the website for it.<br><br>The app works as expected. It could definitely use more features and abilities. But for everything it does do it does it well and accurate and I have no complaints. Maybe in the future they’ll be more features so you can access more of your charts and images. Would also be nice if you could pay bills through the app. But I guess you put to me bells and whistles on something it might be broke all the time.<br><br>The app is ok, but I wish there was a way for it to alert you when you have a new decision. Instead, millions of veterans need to log on and check the app multiple times a day. |
