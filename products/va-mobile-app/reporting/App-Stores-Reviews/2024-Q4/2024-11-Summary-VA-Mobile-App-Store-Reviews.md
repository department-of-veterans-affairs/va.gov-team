It does not work. It takes you to a verification process that does not exist because it is already done. Then it locks up after it skips that and you enter one or the other login credentials and it gets stuck and gives this error message: {"errors": "Code in state is not valid"}. It doesn't work." |

On my iPhone this app is overly difficult to maneuver. To the point that it almost feels intentional. You really have to search for options that should be front and center. And every selection requires a full refresh so you once again have to start a full search for what you are looking for. Too many selections are at the very bottom of the page and the number and location of notifications is overwhelming. I really shouldn’t have to scroll through yet another PACT Act notification just to compose an email…I am somewhat computer literate but for those who are 10-15 years older than me, I am quite sure that this overly complicated app is more than daunting enough to make it not worth trying to navigate.
