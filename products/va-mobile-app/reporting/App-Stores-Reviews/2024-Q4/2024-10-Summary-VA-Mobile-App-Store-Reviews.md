| Appointments      | 23              | Neutral Sentiment<br><br>(10 Positive, 4 Neutral, 9 Negative)   | "I love this app, it keeps getting better and better. It’s the only way I can keep medical appointments organized."<br><br>"Easy to use. Convenient for appointment reminders and order of medications."<br><br>"Appointment section does not work only provides video appointments no in person appointments. Always give an error message about not showing all appointments and to call the facility. What’s the point of the app?"<br><br>"The appointment tab is a great feature but unfortunately is no longer works. Gradually over time it would work and then it would stop it would work and then it would stop, and so on and so forth that has never fixed the issue, it just fixes it for one day which it did a couple weeks ago and my appointments we're showing which is great because I thought it may be it was a problem because I moved from [State] to [State] well as of today it no longer works again."<br><br>"The app is barely helpful. The appointments only tell the complex to go to and the name of the doctor you have an appt with. It doesn't tell you which type (general health, surgery consult, etc) or, in my case yesterday, which clinic within the VA hospital."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Once I do that, it tells me I already have an account. Makes me mad cause I hit sign in and it’s making me do this. This app needs to be redone to be more user friendly and easier to log in. I don’t think it needs such “top notch wanna be” security just to do some things. When the apps does work like it should, it’s nice and convenient. But again the login needs to be made easier and better."<br><br>"This app is great even without a operating phone number I was able to authenticate my account using wi fi. I feel my account is very secure. They offer facial recognition and I was able to generate codes for multi factor authentication. Once in it was so easy to navigate to all services offered. Thank you VA!!!!!!"<br><br>"biometric scanner is terrible. I'll use my finger and then it takes me to the sign in screen. I have to close the app 3-7x before it just accepted the finger print and signs me in. I don't feel like going to the VA website to sign in, just accept my finger and sign in the first time."<br><br>"Worked great at first but now can't get past sign in page. Invested a couple of hours reverifying my ID and uploading documents, calling support and reinstalling but no go."<br><br>"The app shuts down my Pixel when trying to log in using face recognition"<br><br>"easier use and login needed, once you're in it's very useful ty." |
