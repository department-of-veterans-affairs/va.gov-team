# Qualitative feedback on the mobile app

Comments and info from various sources (newest comments towards the top of each section).


## General

- 02/18/22: "It is very nice to be able to see some of the information we have available to us and about us without having to make calls. I have found many things I would have liked to know 30 years ago! I guess I just never found the right person to talk with until recently." (Apple store review)

- 01/30/22: "This app is very helpful to get info and contact the VA for what you need to get done. I was surprised how I could message my doctor, refill meds and access documents that are updated yearly to provide proof of income. There is so much you can do with this app and its secure to use. if you are a veteran and you interact with the VA this app will be very beneficial for you to use. it has many security features, its protected and safe. Highly recommended." (Google play store review)

- 01/28/22: "To think of the many outdated programs used by the government, this app has been by far the BEST thing the VA could have created for veterans. Whatever team decided to come up with this app, in addition to the programming team that designed it needs more than a raise, praise and accolades!! I make it my duty to recommend this app to EVERY vet that I know!! Thank you!" (Apple store review)

- 01/27/22: "So much better than the website and much easier to use!" (Apple store review)

- 01/21/22: "Very easy to use all your info is in one place. Highy recommend this app to all Veterans. Work smarter not harder. Why wait for results when you can just log in and see everything immediately. A++++" (Apple store review)

- 01/19/22: "This is a very good app for a veteran to check on various VA information & claim status!!!" (Google play store review)

- 01/19/22: "Finally the VA enters the digital age! A single source app to see my appointments, message VA doctor Compensation CLAIMS status! You can even see what your current disability percentage % and have an immediate letter created for Veteran Disability and Service verification. Update contact information all within several page clicks vs the rabbit hole navigation nightmare from the website. Great job VA! Now please process my 10 year old claims!: (Google play store review)

- 01/16/22: "Don't get the other VA apps they are a waste! 4of5 because lacks notification option under settings for disability claims!! Must have app to monitor claims & upload your evidence but easy to miss your window due to lack of notifications & snail mail delays. Also you can revoke & designate new claims reps. Can manage your appointments & clinics but not your medications so do get the VA Rx Refill app. Needs the Rx management & bill pay feature added." (Apple store review)

- 01/12/22: "This app is honestly wonderful, and so far pretty well built. Which, by government standards, is a god tier achievement." (Apple store review)

- 01/11/22: "This app was a great way for the VA to enter the 21st century. This app is far from perfect where it does have its issue and is missing some things. As of right now the app does have great claim tracking. The app also has the letter generator which is very helpful." (Apple store review)

- 01/04/22: "I am very pleased with this app. The information is thorough and to the point. Everything pertaining to my service record information is there for me to review at a click. Everything is explained well and the format is very user friendly. **I am enjoying going over and over every little detail listed.** Very proud to be a Veteran and to have a country that takes pride in our wellbeing. Thanks." (Apple store review)

- 01/04/22: "Outstanding app for VA. Pleasantly surprised that this app is so functional. It has all you need. All the essential letters are available for printing. It is ebenefits in an app form. Outstanding job." (Apple store review)

- 12/30/21: "Super tool for Veterans! In an age where everyone has there phone with them, the new VA app really helps veterans that may not have instant access to a desktop computer." (Apple store review)

- 12/30/21: "This app is better than the online version. Thank y'all for this. Hooyah!!!" (Apple store review)

- 12/29/21: "I love how seamlessly the VA slid into the digital age!!!! My providers are on the ''up and up'' too!! It's very very comforting and reassuring to have them only a mouse click away. Thank you all again for the work that you do!" (Google play store review)

- 12/20/21: "This app saves a LOT of time. MUCH more convenient and quicker than using a laptop. if you enable biometrics it is really FAST. EXCELLENT app!" (Google play store review)

- 12/17/21: "Cool experience of the week: today SecVA cold-called me via Teams chat en route to the airport. He wanted to tell me he had just finished up an event in a Texas VetCenter where a Veteran had, unprompted, spoken about the new VA mobile app, and how much he liked it. The Veteran pulled up the app on his phone and proceeded to encourage all the other Veterans in attendance to download it. He also offered some ideas for what he wished it could do. SecVA asked us to follow up with the Veteran and hear his feedback directly, which is in progress now.
Definitely a great feeling to have users sing the praises of your products to the Secretary - and more importantly to other Veterans! Let's keep it up!" (Charles Worthington via Slack)

- 12/14/21: "This is a great app! You can see all your medical appointments, download your benefits letters, and see you vaccinations. I wish we could request travel pay though." (Apple store review)

- 12/13/21: "I really like this app! It's so much easier to get online to this VA app on my smartphone then trying to connect to the VA on my pc! Good job VA for coming up with a quicker way for us disabled veterans to keep in better contact with you!" (Apple store review)

- 12/13/21: "lovely format very user friendly and updated regularly. recommend using this app instead of the actual site. keep up the good work developers :)" (Google play review)

- 12/13/21: "This has to be one of the best things I have seen the VA do. This app is easier for me to use than the web pages, which are all disjointed between VA.gov, my health e vet, and e-benefits. I can see my claims info, health care messages/appointments and locator for VA clinics, community urgent care and pharmacists. Well done on that front. The only thing I wish would be the Rx refill being added to it so I don't have to use more than one app." (Google play review)

- 12/10/21: "With eBenefits going away, would be nice to see more details transferred from there and/or easily accessible in one place verses split between App and the main VA Website. Would also be a huge benefit to have access (all in one place) a segmented view of "some" of the myhealthevet info, e.g., appts, meds, a quick-link of phone numbers associated to that individuals PCM, CBOC, VA Hospital they are tied - along with their VA card for ID purposes. Safeguard it - But use the technology! Stop issuing if you can - place on your hand-held for free. Good start, applaud the efforts to making things easily accessible! In light of our ever-aging elderly veterans, I have mentioned much of this for "their" User Experience/Friendliness!" (Apple store review)

- 12/7/21: "VA has really stepped up their game with this app. Easy to use and navigate. Thank you to the person or persons who developed it!!!" (Apple store review)

- 12/6/21: "I love how this app makes it easier to navigate than the VA website. It's real quick to check the status of my C&P exam, and the list of upcoming medical appointments I have. I was even able to upload needed paperwork for my compensation and pension exam right from this app. I can track the status of my C&P exam, and update to any personal information for my VA account right from this app." (Apple store review)

- 12/1/21: "The app is a great first step! I mean, it's ten years overdue, but it's the VA after all. I didn't have high expectations, but the app is clean, easy to navigate and offers veterans quick access to their information. It can only get better (I hope) and offer more information. Ideally, it can be a one-stop shop for all VA-related info, so no need to bounce between the VA site, eBenefits and other sites searching for info. Please don't stop updating!" (Apple store review)

- 11/30/21: "Really I was thinking oh great another .gov app! But this one is different! Easy to use and works well! I'm impressed!!" (Apple store review)

- 11/28/21: "Hello military friends, the @DeptVetAffairs has a mobile app now. You can do your claims on it as well. It seems extremely easy. Also your appts can be checked through here easy af." "I downloaded it fully expecting a dumpster fire of an app...but I'm pretty impressed with it so far. All my info, appts, everything is correct." "It’s seriously good stuff." [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/poke_m0m/status/1465086436366069772)

- 11/24/21: "I say thank you..Finally a simple way to handle a one stop shop application! Glad that it got done the right way.. Thank you.." (Apple store review)

- 11/23/21: "Everything you need is at your fingertips. Great job VA!" (Apple store review)

- 11/16/21: "I'm very impressed with this App! It is intuitive, easy to navigate and contains information I never noticed in Safari with MHV. The 'Letters' feature is spot on. I immediately downloaded a couple letters for my records. I sincerely thank whoever thought of the Proof of Service card. It will make checkout at the hardware store, so much easier! I give this App and The VA App Development team a big thumbs up for Ease of use and Content! Keep up the good work!" (Apple store review)

- 11/12/21: "The app is great. I hope it continues to grow to give us access to more things but we are off to a great start." (Apple store review)

- 11/12/21: "...You really appreciate the speed of this app at least on iPhone..." (Apple store review)

- 11/9/21: "Well done VA!!! This app saves so much time. Letters and documents can be requested. Claim status can be checked. It literally has everything I need and is so much faster than the website. Very pleased!!! Thank you!!!" (Apple store review)

- 11/9/21: "With this application that the United States Veterans Affairs has created, it allows the end-user almost seamless access to their rating, letters, claim status, and many more.I wish they had this five years ago. But better late than never. I am truly thankful and grateful for the VA. Family first, mission always. God bless America."

- 11/6/21: "This app works amazing I now have access to all of my information so easily now!!" (Apple store review)

- 11/4/21: "Absolutely ecstatic about this app! Great job, VA!" (Apple store review)

- 11/3/21: "Absolutely awesome! Love it!!" (Apple store review)

- 11/1/21: "I am a fan of this app. Takes some getting used to. But very useful tool." (Apple store review)

- 11/2/21: "Well done VA!! This app saves so much time. Letters and documents can be requested. Claim status can be checked. It literally has everything I need and is so much faster than the website. Very pleased!!! Thank you!!!" (Apple store review)

- 10/19/21: "This app makes it much faster to sign in to get my claims information. Before I would go through ID Me and since it was always glitchy, then I would have to use DS Logon." (Apple store review)

- 10/14/21: "I appreciate this! I was looking for something like this for a couple of years now…. Now out of the blue, here it is! Thanks a lot!" [Reddit link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Veterans/comments/q6m6q4/comment/hgg7ria/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

- 10/13/21: "I just set this app up and it makes it so much easier to get my information and to review everything! Thanks to whoever was behind this!" (Apple store review) 

- 10/12/21: "Didn’t know this was a thing. Took 2 minutes to download and login, and I gotta say I like it better than VA.gov" [Reddit link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Veterans/comments/q6m6q4/new_va_health_and_benefits_app/)   

- 10/12/21: "Pros: Veteran Crisis number right there on the home page. Medical Appointments can be seen and even canceled. Can access letters very quickly and easy to send or download to device. Cons: Claims status - can't see very much detail. Claims status - can't upload additional documents. Cannot update direct deposit information." [Reddit link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Veterans/comments/q6m6q4/new_va_health_and_benefits_app/)

- 6/29/21: "I don't know whose idea it was to create this app, but I have been waiting for something like this. I love being able to go through an app to get everything I need. I was able to sign in no problem and access all of the menu items no problem. This thing is a gem. It worked flawlessly. I am going to tell everybody and their mother about this bad boy, once the final release is out." (MHV Coordinator, pre-release)

- 6/29/21: "As a Veteran, I absolutely love the VA mobile app. I was able to access it after verification of my id.me account. This is going to be groundbreaking for Veterans with smartphones!" (MHV Coordinator, pre-release)


## Rx Refill

- 01/26/22: "I have found this app to be easy to navigate, and it contains some of the most important information that a veteran needs at a moment's notice. Just wish it had the option of pharmacy refills." (Apple store review)

- 12/19/21: "Overall the app looks nice and navigates well. I agree with some of the other feedback about moving the log out button to the home page and having the integration of the Rx refill app that already exists. Another good upgrade would be have the ability to do travel pay claims in the app." (Google play store review)

- 12/10/21: "This has to be one of the best things I have seen the VA do. This app is easier for me to use than the web pages, which are all disjointed between VA.gov, my health e vet, and e-benefits. I can see my claims info, health care messages/appointments and locator for VA clinics, community urgent care and pharmacists. Well done on that front. The only thing I wish would be the Rx refill being added to it so I don't have to use more than one app." (Google play store review)

- 11/9/21: "Had trouble logging in and once I did kept getting error stating app wasn’t working. That was when I logged in with MyHealthvet. I then logged out and logged in using ID me and now the app is working great. Would like to see VA RX refill app consolidated with this. Then it would be worthy of a five star rating for me. Also, would like to see VHA travel claims added to this, now that would really nice because the BTSSS can be iffy logging in and using at times. Might also add advance directives in case needed in an urgent situation and they can’t always be obtained quickly by non va hospitals."

- 11/7/21: "This is an awesome app, would be awesome if they could add the RX Refill on this app too." (Apple store review)

- 11/7/21: "I appreciate the VA coming out with an app like this and it is a good start. However I have a request. It would be nice when I get to my health information that I would also have a link or a tab where I could check my prescriptions and refill prescriptions without having to be directed to the website to log into my healthevet and do it from there. It would just streamline the process really nice. Please consider and thank you!" (Apple store review)


## Appointments

- 01/19/22: "I can add VA events to my phone's calendar! Oh, joy!" (Google play store review)

- 01/13/22: "The app is very handy and allows me to review my upcoming appointments and keeps me on track." (Apple store review)

- 11/23/21: "I love this app. Is getting better with each update. For not he only issues is the add the calendar the apple app will trash. Also, hopefully Dark Mode will be added sometime soon. Great job to whoever is working on this app." (Apple store review)

- 11/12/21: "This is a great app to access info quickly and manage your appointments." (Apple store review)

- 11/11/21: "As someone who frequently uses the VA website for disability claims and healthcare, this is a huge timesaver. I read in another review that there might soon be notifications of medical appointment changes. This would be huge since I'm usually not told when an appointment changes or gets cancelled..." (Apple store review)

- 11/5/21: "This helps save alot of time signing in on pc and assists me in keeping up to date aswell as informed on when appointments are upcoming and hte schedule aswell as I can see my doctors note and labs great application" (Apple store review)

- 10/21/21: "These apps are amazing!!! I have several VA appointments monthly and get everything from custom orthotics to medicine and it's wonderful and easy!!" (Apple store review)

- 10/12/21: "Haha thanks. I found out I cancelled my doctor apt today with the app before my hour drive to the VA. Turns out my Doctor decided to cancel it without notifying me." [Reddit link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Veterans/comments/q6m6q4/new_va_health_and_benefits_app/)


## Notifications

- 11/2/21: "Can you guys add an automatic notification part to the app as well as the desktop that will text and/or email us when there is an update to our claim status or medical appointments, etc. I find myself logging in frequently to check things but it would be better to get it pushed to us if only to say 'There has been an update to your claim' or 'We've received a new claim in your account' or even better 'Your disability rating has been changed!'" (Apple store review)


## Letters


- 12/20/21: "I've had the app literally for 10 minutes and I already think it's great. Got to download a couple of documents I didn't have on my file. Let's hope this app keeps working correctly :)" (Google play store review)

- 11/2/21: Sharing screenshot of the letters screen to show 100% disability rating [Reddit link](https://www.reddit.com/r/VeteransBenefits/comments/r133pz/a_year_and_a_half_later_and_we_made_it_boys_and/)

- 11/17/21: "I did not have high expectations of this app. I'm going to be honest. However, I have found it to be extremely helpful!! Every letter you could need is here at your fingertips. Pleasantly surprised." (Apple store review)

11/9/21: Users who share screenshots of disability rating on Reddit:
- [Reddit link 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/VeteransBenefits/comments/qm4tkk/thank_you_gentlemen/)
- [Reddit link 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/Veterans/comments/qlou79/breath_of_relief_thank_you_everyone_lurked_long/)
- [Reddit link 6](https://www.reddit.com/r/VeteransBenefits/comments/qlyk5r/great_way_to_start_the_day_100_pt/)

11/04/21: Multiple recent shares of the letter customization screen among Veterans celebrating their 100% status. 
- [Reddit link 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/VeteransBenefits/comments/qm4tkk/thank_you_gentlemen/) 
- [Reddit link 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Veterans/comments/qlou79/breath_of_relief_thank_you_everyone_lurked_long/) "Congrats! But also, what app is this? I think I need it." 
- [Reddit link 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/VeteransBenefits/comments/qlyk5r/great_way_to_start_the_day_100_pt/) "It’s in the letters section under benefits and service verification." “I like this nice concise view that you were able to see because it presents all the facts on a single screen.”


## Disability claim status

- 01/10/22: "Really needs medicine refill capabilities. Otherwise I love this app. It makes it easy to check my claims multiple times a day." (Google play store review)

- 01/20/22: "I frequently use this app to check the status of disability claims I filed. It's an outstanding way to get an update without waiting on letters in the mail." (Apple store review)

- 12/17/21: "Is it just me or is my compensation claim moving really fast. Anyone else have a claim go through pretty quick? BTW the new VA app is awesome!" [Reddit link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Veterans/comments/rimr75/is_it_just_me_or_is_my_compensation_claim_moving/)

- 11/28/21: "I would like to see more detailed information about my claim status on the website. My status has been showing the same number for 3 months now and it would help a lot to have more detail on where exactly the claim is in the process. Evidence gathering, review, and decision is a really broad and unspecific description of the claim status." (Apple store review)

- 11/22/21: "App is decent but can be much better. Like actually giving some information on where EXACTLY claim is. More than just we received your claim. How bout claim was received on June 20 by Jane smith. Jane smith is doing or is waiting for x y and z. Your claim has moved to John Doe and he is working on x, y, and z. Telling the vet that his claim is up to date as of the current date is misleading because they may think that there was an update when the app is just giving him the date and time they first logged in for that day. The name of the person working on your claim and/or the office where the calim is located would be beneficial as well." (Apple store review)

- 11/20/21: "100 p&t from BDD claim with no VSO, thanks to this Sub...I got out in October of this year and got the correspondence yesterday through the VA phone app..." [Reddit link](https://www.reddit.com/r/VeteransBenefits/comments/qybpst/100_pt_from_bdd_claim_with_no_vso_thanks_to_this/)

- 11/11/21: "...The only improvement I would like to see is an ability to reresh the status of a disability claim. For instance it its 4:30 in the afternoon now but it is showing my most recent status from when I checked it at 10pm yesterday. It seems you can only check it once per 24 hours with the app. This is fine most of the time but when they are getting close to publishing a final decision, I'd like to refresh more often. As it stands, this is now pushing me back to the website daily." (Apple store review)

## Vaccine card

- 01/14/22: "Very nice app! Updated vaccines same day." (Google play store review)

- 11/24/21: "This is awesome. It even shows my vax card." [Reddit link](https://www.reddit.com/r/VeteransBenefits/comments/r1iuib/va_app_i_use_someone_asked/)


## Internal/Stakeholder Feedback

4/2/21: Accessibility Presentation to the VA's 508 Office
* “the work is extraordinary"
* “such a well thought out and executed 508 strategy”
* “this group is 2 years ahead of us”
