# Mobile Redesign - Initiative Brief

Created 10/6/2021 • Updated 11/15/2021

## Product Vision for Redesign
- A personalized, accessible, and future proof app design, using modern native design language 
  - The term redesign is intended to be inclusive of visual design and IA improvements. Interaction design may come later

## Process Goals
- We work iteratively, starting with what we can build to test our riskiest assumption, and setting an example that other teams can aspire to or adopt

## Assumptions/Hypotheses
- Personalization: A revisit of the IA will likely result in a more personalized homepage to minimize taps and accommodate the fact that Veterans’ experience changes over time.
    - Our design language will need to evolve to accommodate a more personalized homepage/IA/search functionality 
    - Riskiest Assumption: Personalizing our design, modernizing our design language, and updating our IA will improve adoption and trust
- Information Architecture: We need IA or a hierarchical/grouping as the way to display information 
- Search: Veterans have a lot of appointments/messages/payments and it would be useful to them to be able to search the app generally
- Accessibility: Updating design language must take into account accessibility requirements
- Scope: We don’t need separate tablet/phone designs and we don’t need to differentiate between two platforms. We will tackle these two parts, if necessary, when we transition to native.

## Risks
- VA.gov team and deviations from the design system/IA
- Screw up something that’s already working
- Our egos 

## Redesign Process
- Phase 0: Dark Mode Implementation & Iteration
- Phase 1: Determining Direction for Personalization, IA, Search
    - Personalization, Search: Initial brainstorming with team
    - Personalization: Create low-fi UX options and feasibility/scope recommendation
    - IA: Unmoderated tree-structure research and feasibility/scope recommendation
    - Search: options analysis and feasibility/scope recommendation
    - Determine direction for Personalization, IA, and Search
- Phase 2+: Validation, Design, and Build
    - User testing for Personalization, Search & IA
    - Initial Design & Build
    - Refine, Build, Test
    - Usability testing

## Measures of Success
- Primary: Veteran adoption, trust 
    - Quantitative
        - Number of taps to key tools go down
        - Increased downloads and repeat usage
        - Maintain high app ratings
    - Qualitative - hear more enthusiasm in user research, Veterans would easily find the features they’re searching for
- Secondary: Reputational and Stakeholder Benefits 
    - Goal: Improve VA’s reputation and ability to design first class apps
        - Winning awards
    - Goal: People continue to be proud of the work and want to show it off
        - Demo to new stakeholders who then want to be champions for the app (they share it with their networks via newsletters or blog posts, etc)
    - MHV coordinator or clinician enthusiasm
