* [In-app review updates](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/features/In-App%20Review%20Updates/InAppReviewUpdates.md) (Therese)
   * POs would like this to be considered for Q1 2024
   * Project expected to be part of the Global teams initiatives for consideration\
   * Epic created [7169](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/va-mobile-60f1a34998bc75000f2a489f/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app/7169)
* Had a quick discussion on Screenshot Prevention
   * POs asked when we talk about this to have another topic to discuss ask it will likely not take the whole time based on our initial discussions
* Mentioned to POs that the Sprint 0 meeting / process likely to change with the new team structure
* When discussing After Visit Summary, Rachel would like a heads up as she plans to invite others to attend 

## 11/30/23
* [OS version support updates](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/features/Version_Support/Version_Support.md) (Therese)
   * turns out we do have officially supported OS versions, but they haven't been updated since launch
      * We do NOT have an experience in the app to block or warn users
   * we should take into account OS version usage and any other tech considerations when deciding which versions to support
   * We should reassess supported versions on a reegular cadence
   * We could use waygates/availability framework to enforce this
   * May need to handle access to medical records separately from supported OS versions since medical records need to be accessible longer. 

## 11/2/23
* [QA for analytics](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/features/QA%20for%20analytics/Sprint%200%3A%20QA%20for%20analytics.md)  (Greta/Therese)

  * Not for Q4, but keep on the list

## 8/31/23
* Identity Team coming to talk about Terms of Use
  * Intiative Goal: To have on TOU that Veterans agree to that would give access to everything
  * Target production rollout early October
  * Mobile shouldn't have any work, it will be part of the sign in experience
    * If user accepts they can continue to servicing on the app/web
    * If user declines they will be logged out and messaging displayed what next
    * User does have the opportunity to accept TOU if they previously declined 
* Call outs & Action Items 
   - Review content on the page that is displayed when user does not accept TOU.  Ensuring there is clarity for the Veteran that not having access to va.gov also means not having access to the app
   - Is there a need to delete authentication and when does it become enforceable.  May want to consider doing staggered deletion objects
   - Share w/identity team any links we show on mobile today regarding TOU (i.e. what info do we show in privacy policy).
   - Will this work for people who are still on version of the app that use IAM
     - How many people are still on IAM? 

* Question to Rachel/Ryan
  *   Would we want to give users the ability to link out and review TOUs at a later time? 

## 8/17/23
* [Sprint 0: Backend Status Visualization Tool - Andrew](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/features/BE-status-visualization/BE-status-visualization-sprint-0.md)

  * This could help solve other issues like Call Center troubleshooting and data analytics clarification

  * the impact of this work is hard to measure, but it is valuable


  
## 7/6/23

## 6/22/23

* Q3 Planning discussions
  * Rachel & Ryan encouraging us to provide suggestions and reccommendations when discussing potential solutions, etc.
  * Deep Linking experiment with process
    * Rachel & Ryan could be more involved up front to help to set the direction
    * Would like to try building things sooner in the process
    * Desired Outcome: POs to know if their involvement earlier will help to break problems into smaller chunks, and speed up the process - getting to production faster
    * Discussed trade-offs of this approach
      * works well with smaller, focused teams - QA capacity concerns in Q3
      * long-term roadmap could be less stable
      * Agreement on shipping in smaller chunks

* Matt to run through updates to the Q2 plan
  * Health team is still focusing on Secure Messaging, then will move to Check-in
    * There will be some discovery before SM, but wil not pull anyone off other work for Check-in yet
    * The Check-in work has been streatched out to take less capacity all at once
    * Will change the scope of the Profile Fail error feature to account for capacity if needed
  * Veteran Status Card
    * Ryan will take the lead in Q2 but no capacity is expected from the team for this in Q2
