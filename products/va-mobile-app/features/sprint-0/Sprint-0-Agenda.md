## Working session notes


## 8/31/23
* Identity Team coming to talk about Terms of Use
  * Intiative Goal: To have on TOU that Veterans agree to that would give access to everything
  * Target production rollout early October
  * Mobile shouldn't have any work, it will be part of the sign in experience
    * If user accepts they can continue to servicing on the app/web
    * If user declines they will be logged out and messaging displayed what next
    * User does have the opportunity to accept TOU if they previously declined 
* Call outs & Action Items 
   - Review content on the page that is displayed when user does not accept TOU.  Ensuring there is clarity for the Veteran that not having access to va.gov also means not having access to the app
   - Is there a need to delete authentication and when does it become enforceable.  May want to consider doing staggered deletion objects
   - Share w/identity team any links we show on mobile today regarding TOU (i.e. what info do we show in privacy policy).
   - Will this work for people who are still on version of the app that use IAM
     - How many people are still on IAM? 

* Question to Rachel/Ryan
  *   Would we want to give users the ability to link out and review TOUs at a later time? 

## 8/17/23
* [Sprint 0: Backend Status Visualization Tool - Andrew](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/features/BE-status-visualization/BE-status-visualization-sprint-0.md)


## 8/3/23

* [Sprint 0: Content management system (CMS)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/features/CMS/CMS%20sprint%200.md) (Misty)
* [Sprint 0: Tracking referring URLs](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/features/Track%20referring%20URLs/Sprint%200%3A%20Track%20referring%20URLs.md) (Greta)

## 7/20/23

  * This could help solve other issues like Call Center troubleshooting and data analytics clarification
  * Error messages are definitely Veteran-facing, so work to make them better is impactful to Veterans
  * the impact of this work is hard to measure, but it is valuable


  
## 7/6/23

* [Sprint 0: User Endpoint Enhancement - Jayson](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/features/user-endpoint-enhancement/UEE-Sprint-0.md)
  * This was identified as being related to the Profile Fail Error Handling which was prioritized for Q3.


## 6/22/23

* Q3 Planning discussions
  * Rachel & Ryan encouraging us to provide suggestions and reccommendations when discussing potential solutions, etc.
  * Deep Linking experiment with process
    * Rachel & Ryan could be more involved up front to help to set the direction
    * Would like to try building things sooner in the process
    * Desired Outcome: POs to know if their involvement earlier will help to break problems into smaller chunks, and speed up the process - getting to production faster
    * Discussed trade-offs of this approach
      * works well with smaller, focused teams - QA capacity concerns in Q3
      * long-term roadmap could be less stable
      * Agreement on shipping in smaller chunks


## 6/7/23

* [Sprint 0: Submit Feedback](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12PejlFxL-OanOAnxJHqMLTawYnvfcNcRavPp2yVI3_w/edit#heading=h.mnq6vtjqteg4) (Tim R)

* Omni-channel Hand-off (Rachel)
  * 5/24 we want to meet with Andrea Schnieder and her team to talk about technical discovery (potentially 2-4pm ET, hopefully changing to less)
  * Rachel to find out if we will use this meeting or Andrea will schedule something else

## 4/26/23

* Matt to run through updates to the Q2 plan
  * Health team is still focusing on Secure Messaging, then will move to Check-in
    * There will be some discovery before SM, but wil not pull anyone off other work for Check-in yet
    * The Check-in work has been streatched out to take less capacity all at once
    * Will change the scope of the Profile Fail error feature to account for capacity if needed
  * Veteran Status Card
    * Ryan will take the lead in Q2 but no capacity is expected from the team for this in Q2
* [Sprint 0: Display Zoom on Android](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zJ1efdJNzZx9KutF0i8yC0KnXk4rV8E2JrlR8Xwqar0/edit?usp=sharing)
