  * This could help solve other issues like Call Center troubleshooting and data analytics clarification
  * Error messages are definitely Veteran-facing, so work to make them better is impactful to Veterans
  * the impact of this work is hard to measure, but it is valuable


  
## 7/6/23

* [Sprint 0: User Endpoint Enhancement - Jayson](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/features/user-endpoint-enhancement/UEE-Sprint-0.md)

## 6/22/23

* Q3 Planning discussions
  * Rachel & Ryan encouraging us to provide suggestions and reccommendations when discussing potential solutions, etc.
  * Deep Linking experiment with process
    * Rachel & Ryan could be more involved up front to help to set the direction
    * Would like to try building things sooner in the process
    * Desired Outcome: POs to know if their involvement earlier will help to break problems into smaller chunks, and speed up the process - getting to production faster
    * Discussed trade-offs of this approach
      * works well with smaller, focused teams - QA capacity concerns in Q3
      * long-term roadmap could be less stable
      * Agreement on shipping in smaller chunks

* Matt to run through updates to the Q2 plan
  * Health team is still focusing on Secure Messaging, then will move to Check-in
    * There will be some discovery before SM, but wil not pull anyone off other work for Check-in yet

    * Will change the scope of the Profile Fail error feature to account for capacity if needed
  * Veteran Status Card
    * Ryan will take the lead in Q2 but no capacity is expected from the team for this in Q2
