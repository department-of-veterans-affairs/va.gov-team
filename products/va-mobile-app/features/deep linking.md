**Sprint 0 Product Brief- Deep Linking**

**Problem Statement**
Today, the deep linking functionality does not exist in the Mobile App.
We want to allow a user the ability able to follow a single link (via push notification) into a specific area within the mobile app.

**What is Deep Linking?**

Deep links are a type of link that send users directly to an app instead of a website or a store. They are used to send users straight to specific in-app locations, saving users the time and energy locating a particular page themselves – significantly improving the user experience.

**How is this Achieved?:**
Deep linking does this by specifying a custom URL scheme (iOS Universal Links) or an intent URL (on Android devices) that opens your app if it’s already installed. Deep links can also be set to direct users to specific events or pages, which could tie into campaigns that you may want to run.

We want to send this custom URL via EXISTING push notification in the app.

**Current Experience**
We have no seemless way to allow the user to follow single secure link that will take them to specific area in teh mobile app.

**Desired Outcomes**

Deep links produce a seamless user journey that reduces churn and increases the likelihood of an install. They let you make sophisticated campaigns while providing a better user experience, moving users onto your app in a single click.

We want to provide the veteran with the best user experience possible in order to drive conversion and retention rates in the app.
