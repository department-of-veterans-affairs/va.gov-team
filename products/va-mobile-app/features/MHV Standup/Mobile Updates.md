  Working through disabling a Veteran’s account if they elect not to receive secure messages
  Eric’s question
  
  Is the 10% pharmacy users only through a specific link (e.g. test flight) not on app store? MHV would like to inform MHV Coordinators in case they get calls so curious on how users get access to use the prescriptions feature
  Chen, Angela P. (liberty It Solutions, Llc) - please send that link to Proctor, Alicia M. (GovernmentCIO) so we can include it in the notes.
