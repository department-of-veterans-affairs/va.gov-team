<h2>Form Status Product Brief</h2>


<h2>Product Management Product Brief</h2>

Last Udpated: May 2025

<h3>Overview</h3>

Today forms do not exist in the VAHB mobile app in the way that they do on VA.gov. There are currently 9 forms that can show up on the web homescreen that are not shown at all in the mobile app. 

**End end goal** would be for Veteran to see full history of every form that they have submitted (example Docusign).

<h3>Problem Statement</h3>

Currently Veterans do not know the status of their forms once they have been submitted. They are not alerted of form status changes or "silent failures" when their forms fail to upload correctly. Currently Veterans are not able to add or edit forms on the Mobile App


<h3>Solution Approach</h3>

**MVP**
Allow users to view the staus of their submitted forms in Mobile. MVP is not to allow users to fill out/edit and submit their form in the app. MVP will allow users to edit and submit their form in a web view. 
- NOT part of the MVP: A Veteran can edit their form in the app
- NOT part of the MVP: A Veteran receives a notification of the status of their form updating

Platform aspect - Design System Patterning Consideration:
- Part of the work here will be defining the pattern that any form can use
- Status language from form to form is inconsistent (Example: In Progress vs. Pending). Need to establish a design system pattern so that all form statuses are standardized. Could start with "In Progress", -"Action Needed", "Received". But keep in mind that future forms could required more statuses.
- Need to establish push notification guidelines: Would a push notification get sent when the form status changes?

<h3>Open Questions</h3>

1. HMW provide access to forms in a mobile forward way that does not make the Veteran feel like they are filling out a form
2. Where should Forms live in the app? 

<h3>Closed Questions</h3>

<h3>Desired Outcomes</h3>

- A Veteran can view their submitted form in the app - Where in the app should this live?
- A Veteran can view the status of their submitted form in the app and status are consistent across all forms
- A Veteran can view the history of all of their submitted form in the app (should this be part of MVP?)
- Need to determine if there will be a weblink for each form that will send the user to the webview where they would be able to do more with the form (like edit it).
