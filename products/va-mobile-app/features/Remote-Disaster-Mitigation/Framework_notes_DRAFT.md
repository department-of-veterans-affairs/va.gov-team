This file will likely be absorbed into a process file (or somewhere else describing the functionality) in the future.

Notes on how the availability framework works, that future folks making decisions on turning one on may want to know:
* Address (Contact Info) and Phone Number (Contact Info) are collective sets - turning on the waygate for address applies to both home and mailing address, and phone number impacts home, work and cell.
* The login waygate will only ever function as use case 3 (the buttons to log in are available, and an informational alert appears onscreen)
* We do not have the ability to add waygates to webviews (such as the privacy policy, VA location finder, VA COVID-19 updates, etc)
