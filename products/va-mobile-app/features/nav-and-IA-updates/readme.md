# VA Mobile App 2.0: Navigation and Information Architecture Updates
The VA Mobile app was designed to allow Veterans to more easily complete key transactions across VA Health and Benefits services.

As the app grows in its feature set, we want to ensure the structure and organization of the app makes sense and can accommodate the new features we have identified as of interest on our roadmap.
