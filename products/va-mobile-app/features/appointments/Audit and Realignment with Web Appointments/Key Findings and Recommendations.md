## Key Findings
Appointment List & Details Content Audit

1. Inconsistent  display of data when the info is available (i.e. missing provider name, type of care, reason for visit)
2. We have an opportunity to provide clarity & guidance on how to join or attend appointments or what actions are needed to complete a task (i.e. cancel or change an appt, provider will call, etc) 
3. There is an opportunity to modify modality on the list view to align with web 
4. Clean up of past appointment view (pending & canceled appts)
5. Make adjustments to Headers and Banners

High Impact, potentially high effort

1. Webâ€™s redesign provides a better job at telling the user how to attend an appt (i.e go to x facility to attend this appt)
2. Potentially moving from 2 tab list view to 3 (i.e. upcoming, pending, and  past)
