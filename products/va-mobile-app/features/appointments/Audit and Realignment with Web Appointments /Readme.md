## Purpose

During the Appointments V2 integration, we noticed some inconsistencies on how we (mobile) display or do not display information on the appointment list/detail views. Some highlights, to name a few

- Inconsistencies when displaying info such as type of care, reason for care,
- What info is avail for CC vs VA appts etc
- Missing info/instructions for video appts

Veteran Pain Points

1.) Missing and confusing appointment information makes the list difficult for Veterans to prepare for their appointments
2.) In past research studies, Veterans expressed that missing and or inconsistent appointment details such as type of care, clinic name, physical location, and provider information make it difficult for them to understand their appointments.
