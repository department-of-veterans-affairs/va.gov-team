**Next Steps/Action items:

- [ ] Make decision on the user experience that will be built for mobile
    - [ ]  Scenario 1: Check-in w/pre-registration tasks 
    - [ ]  Scenario 2: Check-in w/out pre-registration tasks (Veteran would only receive check in option if they have completed and said Yes to all pre-registration tasks.  This idea was shared by Stephen as a possible MVP experience
Action Item:  Ryan asked that the mobile team provide the LOE to implement the 2 experiences 

- [ ] Is Push Notification required for MVP? The team discussed Push Notification and what that may entail.  Rachel/Ryan mentioned the need for Push Notification for MVP as this will be an avenue of making Veterans aware that the feature is avail in the app
  - Open questions & discussions needed:
    -  If we add Push Notifications, how does/would that impact existing SMS workflow.  Could there be confusion from Veteran receiving SMS and Push Notification to perform check in tasks
    -  What are some other opportunities that we can help inform Veterans that Check in is avail on the app
       -  Changes to poster to notify Veterans that they can check in using the app
       -  Updating SMS text messaging to advise Veterans they can use the app
       -  What coordination would be needed with Vetext/VANotify to make changes to or add new push

- Web and Mobile to review what the lift would be for both teams to support the requirements (i.e. changing of poster, updating SMS text, if mobile were to go with scenario 2, would this require any changes API, etc)

The above decisions and questions will be added to the decision log.
