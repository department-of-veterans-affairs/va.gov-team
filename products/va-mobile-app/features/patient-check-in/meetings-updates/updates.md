This past week:
- OCTO developed a user story and acceptance criteria, for day-of, patient check-in experience on the mobile app.
- We answered remaining questions from the initial discovery conducted by mobile team in Q1.
- We discussed what we want to learn from this mobile/web experiment, in service of informing how OCTO scales mobile development.
