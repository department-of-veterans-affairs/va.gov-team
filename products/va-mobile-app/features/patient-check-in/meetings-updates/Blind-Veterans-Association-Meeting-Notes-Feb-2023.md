# Meeting with Blinded Veterans Association/Mobile App team  
February 2023

Mobile App Attendees: Lauren Russell, Liz Straghalis, Matt Hall, Meko Hong, Misty Milliron-Grant

BVA Attendees: Tim Hornak    

## Notes

Significant gap for veterans who, aside from blind Veterans, aren’t tech savvy who can use the check-in process. Needs to make sure the MSA/PSA is up to date with how it works.

Verification of information - meaning next of kin - has been helpful.

Notification needs to pop up in the app to make sure you are at the right waiting area. Central waiting areas in some VAMCs serve multiple specialties.

### Top Items for mobile app

* Ability to communicate with providers (Secured Messaging)  
* Ability to Check In for an appt (Check In process)   
   * Gaps in current process for those that are not all that tech savvy  
       * PSA/MSA can serve them when kiosk goes away  
       * Person comes in with caregiver or volunteer   
           * They can be guided through experience and navigate that is in a format that anyone can use  
       * QRs  
       * SMS texts  
   * App Opportunities: GEO tag, have clinic appt and tag so that notification pops up to say specific location within   
   * Need to ensure we provide messaging around ‘Now that you are checked in make sure you are in the right waiting area or you may get missed’  
       * With kiosks, Tim said he’s already talking with someone to help with check-in so that person helps him make sure he’s in the right waiting area.  
   * Risks: Overload of SMS notifications & Push notification timings (moderate to high tech users)  
* Ability to check Appointments   
* Pharmacy Checks & Refills

### Blind Veteran Experience

* Verify info; any situations where you have to talk to a person vs. digitally  
   * Making sure they are in the right location is crucial!  
       * since there are a few different waiting rooms that serve one clinic.  
* Pain points for blind Veterans when using a kiosk:  
   *  Had someone helping him or MSA helped.   
   * \_ “Never used the kiosk because I couldn't find it”.  \_  
   * Kiosks did not have a screen reader functionality  
   * Doesn’t carry headphones around with him.  How to use it in a **secure private fashion**.    
   * Kiosk used for other things such as travel reimbursement, banking info etc… (privacy concerns) More we can have on the app the better  
* Access the information and be able to update themselves.   
* **Q: Related to check-in, what else would you want the facility/clinic to know about you?”**  
   * **A: It would be helpful if the VA knew that I was blind (when I was checking in.) Vision impaired is displayed on the chart, but can be dismissible.**  
* Be able to see the notification – benign ones and not (what does this mean?), not clear on this one  
   * “Sometimes behavioral things can be an issue, being able to “see” the notification… benign v non-benign…” should follow up on this one, but it may refer to who all at VA would become involved.. based on what’s they report while checking-in   
* Notifications  
   * Blind/Low Vision veterans tend to set up as many appointments on one day during a time period. Need to make sense of the check-in links that come in the same text message  
       * Issue: SMS text notifications for one day with multiple appointments come in a group, identified by C1, C2, C3  
       * Blind Veteran accidentally forgot to confirm one of the appointment notifications, because the messages sound similar.  This caused her to miss her scheduled appt, because she was not able to confirm and do the check in process.  Ultimately she had  to reschedule the appointment.  Check in from SMS or Push Notification deep link  
       * Described a potential way to “parse each appointment” to ensure that they are checking into each one  
* Travel Pay  
   * Travel desk” They help you upload all the documents and rideshare/taxi receipts. Has to come in and help veterans. But it would be good to make a solution to help them get this sooner. If denied, I want some insight on how to appeal it.  
       * Travel pay website: Blind and Low Vision is not able to use it.  Not useable for them at all  
       * Use paper form and travel clerk.  Done after the appt within 30 days.  Print receipt and attach it to the travel form.  
           * Upload receipts with ease & submit forms  
           * Status of reimbursement, in process, appeal, here is the appt -> Submit a request

### Questions:

* Will the app have an experience for check in to allow for Reschedule/Cancel appts  
   * Scenario:  Last minute show up and had some other thing that come up so need to cancel or reschedule as part of check in  
   * Could happen when a veteran is in an appt and something is uncovered and may take longer in an appt.  So causes follow up appt to be rescheduled.   
   * What are opportunities to help communication through the offices; Provider not having capacity to get them… Rare situation but happens

### Some ideas to kick around:

* Provide real-time information for any changes or updates to the appointment etc?  
   * Can we notify/allow them to notify and MSA if running late, etc  
   * Current state: Usually through the MSA, or a quick Teams message. Outside coordination. Sometimes providers don’t have the bandwidth to keep up with last minute changes  
* Check-in for all available (stacked) appts for the day?  
   * Consider providing a way to disclose Reasonable accommodation information, or other information that a scheduler needs on the day of the appt  
   * Secure message?  
* Research across various VA facilities to uncover different operations or use cases?  
* Pair check-in and travel pay together?   
   * Can we calculate mileage within the app? Can we track the travel time, to facilitate the travel reimbursement upon check-in?  
* Create secure outlets for Veterans using the tools we have?  
   * Upload photos/Scan receipts, submit forms
