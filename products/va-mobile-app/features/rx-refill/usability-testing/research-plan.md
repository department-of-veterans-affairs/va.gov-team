# Research Plan for VA Mobile Team, Pharmacy, 05/25/22

## Background 

The VA Mobile App aims to make it easier and faster for users already engaged with the VA to complete small transactions related to their existing account. In an effort to expand the number of transactions that can be accomplished in the app and meet Veteran needs, we developed a prototype of what the first version of the pharmacy feature in the Mobile App could look like. We will be focused on testing the refill, prescription history, and tracking parts of that feature in this research. 

## OCTO Objectives

This work supports the following objectives:

### Measures to increase:

* Usage of digital self- service tools
* Completion rate of online transactions
* Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov

### Measures to decrease

* Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution
* Time from online benefit discovery to benefit delivery
* Time to successful complete and submit online transactions

## Research Goals

The goals of this research is to:
1. Determine if the current concept of refilling a prescription matches Veteran’s expectations and understanding
2. Identify major usability or content issues with the current concept of viewing prescription history and tracking prescriptions

### Outcome

The results of this research will help us:

* Determine if there are any big usability concerns that Veterans experience with the designs
* Inform later iterations of the designs as we consider MVP and post-MVP features

### Research Questions

This research will help us answer:

* Do Veterans understand the difference between refillable and non-refillable prescriptions in the refill modal?
* Will Veterans be able to accomplish the main pharmacy tasks:
    * Refilling a prescription?
    * Viewing their prescription history and prescription details?
    * Viewing tracking details of a prescription?
* What high-level prescription information do Veterans need to know?

### Hypothesis

* Veterans will be able to accomplish the pharmacy tasks designed in the prototype, and will articulate what the refillable and non-refillable categories mean.
* Veterans will have different high-level prescription information that they need to know depending on the context of the prescription


## Method 

We will be conducting a remote moderated usability study with Veterans using a low fidelity Figma prototype. 

### Location 

This research will be remote via Zoom.

### Resource Materials

## Recruitment 

### Recruitment Approach

The intended audience for this research are Veterans and caregivers who refill prescriptions at the VA. We will be recruiting participants through Perigean. 

We aim to be inclusive in our research and will be using the lean and representative strategy to recruit participants.

### Recruitment Criteria 

We want to recruit 15 Veterans for an expected completion of 10-12 studies.  

#### Primary Criteria (must-haves)

* Can join via a mobile device (tablet or phone) 
* Veterans and caregivers with experience managing VA prescriptions using MHV or the Rx refill app
    * _Managing prescriptions is defined as:_
     * _Refilling a VA prescription,_
     * _Viewing VA prescription history_
     * _Tracking a VA prescription package_
     * _Renewing a VA prescription_
* Diverse participants in age, gender, race/ethnicity, and cognitive ability

#### Secondary Criteria (nice-to-haves)

For inclusivity, it would be nice to have:

* 8 participants 55-64+
* 8 participants with cognitive disabilities 
* 4 participants from rural areas
* 4 participants without a degree
* 2 participants that identify as women
* At least 4 participants that identity as non-Caucasian
* At least 2 participants that use assistive technology
    * Due to tool constraints, recruit for hearing aids and magnification/zoom
