# Research Plan for VA Mobile Team, Pharmacy, 08/2022

## Background 

The VA Mobile App aims to make it easier and faster for users already engaged with the VA to complete small transactions related to their existing account. In June of 2022, we completed a round of usability testing on the first version of the pharmacy feature in the Mobile App. This was done in an effort to expand the number of transactions that can be accomplished in the app and meet Veteran needs. Output from the research resulted in significant organizational changes to how pharmacy information is displayed. We will be conducting a second round of usability testing to ensure that the organizational changes are intuitive and design still meet Veteran needs.

## Research Goals

The goals of this research are to:

1. Determine if users are able to navigate the IA, request prescription refills, and find prescriptions that they are looking for 
2. Identify major usability or content issues with the current designs

### Outcome

The results of this research will help us:

* Determine if there are any big usability concerns that Veterans experience with the designs
* Inform if the currently implemented designs can be released to production or if additional refinements are needed

### Research Questions

This research will help us answer:

* Are users able to easily find and access the refill modal?
* Do users understand where requested refills go and where to find requested refills?
* Are users able to successfully find prescriptions theyâ€™re looking for?
* Do users understand the tab structure and what items could be in the tabs?

### Hypothesis

* Veterans will be able to easily access the refill modal
* Veterans will be able to navigate the IA, understand the tab structure, and what items could be in the tabs


## Method 

We will be conducting a remote moderated usability study with Veterans using a high fidelity Figma prototype. 

### Location

This research will be remote via Zoom.

## Recruitment 

### Recruitment Approach

The intended audience for this research are Veterans who refill prescriptions at the VA. We will be recruiting participants through Perigean. 

We aim to be inclusive in our research and will be using the lean representative strategy to recruit participants.
