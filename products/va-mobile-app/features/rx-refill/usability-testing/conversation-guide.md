## Introduction - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Esther and there are a few of my teammates who would like to watch this session. Would it be OK with you if I invited them to join us? 

* If yes: Admit from waiting room

Today we're going to talk about accessing and managing prescriptions with the VA Mobile App. Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

* **This entire session should take about an hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
* **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. There’s no right or wrong answers and I will not be offended by any opinions you express. I welcome any and all feedback that you have.
* **You'll be interacting with a prototype.** A prototype is like a simulation of what the app might look like in the future. It's a guess we have before we build anything, which is why we're talking with Veterans like you to get your thoughts so we can improve it. Since it’s a prototype some areas will be clickable, and some will not. I'll guide you if you get stuck in any of those areas.
* **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**

Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

* If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

_Start recording._

I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Before we look at the prototype, I’d like to start with a few warm-up questions:

* Over the last month, how have you used VA.gov, MyHealthEVet or any other VA apps to manage your healthcare or benefits with the VA? 
    * If yes: Which of these sites or apps did you go to most frequently? Why?
    * If no: Move to next question
* Do you have the VA Health and Benefits mobile app?
    * If yes: 
     * When did you first start using it?
     * What are the main reasons you use it?
     * How frequently do you go into the app? Daily? Weekly? Monthly?
     * What do you like best? What do you wish you could change?
    * If no; Move to next question
* Do you currently use any digital services such as VA.gov, MHV, or the Rx refill app to view and manage your prescriptions?
    * If yes: What is your experience like using these tools?
    * If no: How do you currently view and manage your prescriptions?
