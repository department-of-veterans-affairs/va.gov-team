**Overview**

Overtime individual disciplines will identify technical debt or administrative items that they need to complete and do in order to keep the app, documents, and code up to date. In doing so Disciplines will idenitfy these opportunities, scope them, and work with the PM to get that work prioritized within identified capacity allocated for such work.

**Other Info:**
- Historically the mobile app allocated resources for this to be done and managed through 1 pm; however starting Q4 2023 individual teams will be set-up and they will be responsible for their own technical tech
- These individual teams will be responsible for maintaining this backlog, identifying new items, determining what to do, scoping , sizing, and prioritizing the work within their team and also coordinating needs outside of their team (ex QA testing)
- Note that individual teams may have their own unique processes and styles in managing this work within their teams - this no speccifics on this page 
  
**Process after Sprint 86**

1.) Technical debt or code upkeep work identified and shared with applicable teambs 
2.) The applicable team (Global, API, QA, Health, Shared Services) to detail out the work and scope the effort
3.) The applicable team (Global, API, QA, Health, Shared Services) to prioritize the work within their team or determine its prioritize in the backlog
4.) The applicable team will coordinate with necessary Shared Services Teams (QA, API, Design Team) to scope their effort and coordinate when work will be prioritized
5.) Once work is prioritized within the applicable sprint that applicable team (Global, API, QA, Health, Shared Services) will work the ticket as needed (update code, update docs, update unit tests, etc) 
6.) If testing is needed and was coordinated/prioritized by applicable team then testing is completed 
7.) Work is released within the release cadence
