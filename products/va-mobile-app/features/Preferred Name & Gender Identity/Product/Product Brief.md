## Problem Statement

In June 2021, VEO came to VA.gov to talk about integrating preferred name,
pronouns, gender identity, and sexual orientation into the VA.gov profile. The
LGBTQ Health Services office is trying to mitigate issues around Veterans
showing up to health appointments and being addressed improperly, causing
distress to both patients and staff who are working with inaccurate and outdated
information.
