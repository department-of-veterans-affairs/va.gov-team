# App health/confidence dashboard using detox automation artifacts

## Problem 

QA has the majority of the app covered by high level automation.
How can we surface and use resulting automation artifacts in a helpful manner?

### Current Experience ###

* Currently detox automation runs and the test artifacts live in testrail. which most people outside of QA never look at.

### Desired Outcomes ###

* A dashboard or useful representation of test automation artifacts to measure app health.

## Assumptions and Level of Confidence

1. What assumptions are we making about this problem?  How confident are we about these assumptions?
2. we are assuming that stakeholders are interested in overall app health and automation results

## Risks

TBD

## Business Goals

TBD

## Technical Approach

*	TBD

## Measuring success 

*	TBD

## Stakeholders

* TBD, does this need to be useful to VA level visibility, potentially without context?

## Open Questions

- Where would the dashboard live/how would it be accessed?
- What information would be useful to be displayed?
- What is an appropriate threshold of expected test failures?
- Will this be used for good and specifically not for evil?
- What are the people-hour costs (points) to set up and maintain a dashboard like this?
- Can this integrate into a larger report/dashboard with service uptimes?
