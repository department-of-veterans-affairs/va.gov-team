# Content decision log - Push notifications


## V2a decisions
After getting feedback from a stakeholder, we updated the secondary button for both the Face ID and Push context screens from "Skip" to "Skip for now". All other decisions remain the same.

## V2 decisions

We took our V1 of push notifications consent and opt-in experience and made edits to account for potential additions to notifications. Not all screens had changes from V1 to V2.

But we also need to be accurate and truthful (i.e., saying "upcoming appointments, new messages, and more" wouldn't be accurate with only 2 current pushes. There's no "more."). We recommended calling out one of our pushes (upcoming appointments in this screenshot). Then the "and more" would be accurate. Product can make the call as to which push to call out in this instance: appointments or messages. In the future, we can call out other new pushes, such as claim decision letters.</br> <br>We also updated wording that starts this sentence, removing the mention of sending "notifications to your device." We did this since it will already be mention in a more permanent place: the Notication setting screen.</br> <br>The second sentence on this screen has not changed from V1 decisions. | Misty Milliron-Grant | 5/20/2024 |

(See V1 decision below for this screen for more context on this alert.) Again, Product can make the call as to which push to call out in this instance: appointments or messages. In the future, we can call out other new pushes, such as claim decision letters. No other copy changes to this screen. | Misty Milliron-Grant | 5/20/2024 | 



_*The following screens have no changes from V1 decisions: Face ID, Notification setting enabled, and Notification setting disabled.*_</br>
<br>

## V1 decisions
In February/March 2024, we began our initial thinking around the end-to-end experience for Veterans when (1) they're first asked to turn on notifications and (2) there are subsequent encounters with push notification capabilities. These decisions were based on an opt-in flow that only accounts for the current push notifications we had at the time (appointments and messages).

|Face ID screen | <img width="227" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-11 at 10 55 20 AM" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/102106810/83c99bd8-27d1-4067-b6d1-e482cd6b74a7"> | ![Screenshot 2024-03-12 at 8 00 30 AM](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/102106810/ef475565-3ff0-43fb-9d5d-d1149bf11fcb) | The Face ID enablement screen has nothing to do with push notifications. But it is a screen that appears before a new context-setting screen for push. Therefore, we want a similar content structure for both screens. For both, we also want to bring forward the benefits of enabling these functionalities instead of just asking Veterans to turn them on. The updated content speaks to the value Face ID provides: easier sign in. We updated the copy in the second body copy sentence to remind Veterans they are in control of this functionality and can change it at any time. |  Misty Milliron-Grant | 03/12/2024 |
|Push context screen | n/a (new state) | <img width="222" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-11 at 10 58 32 AM" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/102106810/8afd4728-bb19-45d9-8a6e-27c429b251a9"> | This is a new screen to help set context for what Veterans will get out of push notifications. Similar to the Face ID screen, we used the header to communicate the benefit of push (staying updated). We purposefully left the benefit statement somewhat vague in the header and used the body copy to give more details on the benefits (i.e., specific push notifications Veterans get). We also chose the phrase "app notifications". "Push notifications" is jargon, and we can't be sure a Veteran knows what a "push" means without testing. We used the body copy to explain that these are notifications sent to a device vs. text or email. We also explicitly tell Veterans what pushes they'll get (appointments and messages). As we enable more pushes, this copy will need to be updated. Finally, like with the Face ID screen, we added a sentence explaining that Veterans can change notifications any time, giving them the power to control this functionality. | Misty Milliron-Grant | 03/12/2024 |
|Notication setting screen enabled | <img width="274" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-11 at 3 40 50 PM" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/102106810/b8782f47-16c3-43f0-9d6c-1fe7f20aa7de"> | <img width="275" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-11 at 3 46 47 PM" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/102106810/0f1ccb47-44c7-436c-875d-96b8d3e641e0"> | Since we were looking at the end-to-end experience, we took this opportunity to improve the notifications screen itself. Previously, it included redundant headings and unhelpful copy. After confirming with Accessibility, we decided to remove the subheading and update the body copy to further remind Veterans how these notifications will be received (to their device). We also added an external link that tells Veterans where they can go to manage their email/text notifications. Finally, as part of this work, we worked with VEText team to update the API-pulled copy for the toggles. This copy is now more aligned with VA content style guide. |  Misty Milliron-Grant | 03/12/2024 |
|Notication setting screen disabled | <img width="274" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-11 at 3 40 43 PM" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/102106810/709cf841-7e87-4d56-acf6-a3f69b498036"> | <img width="280" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-11 at 3 48 01 PM" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/102106810/9f2e0830-0f86-44d6-a794-b3ad5ec5ab82"> | Again, we took the opportunity to update copy in an alert that we already show Veterans. This alert appears when a Veteran has not enabled push. At this point, to enable, a Veteran must now go to their device settings to do so. Improvements here include using a "slim alert" without a header to reduce redundancy, updating body copy to remind Veterans these are "app" notifications, and updating button copy to be more clear (device settings not app settings). We've also included the external link for managing email/text notifications on VA.gov. |  Misty Milliron-Grant | 03/12/2024 |
|Notification setting screen not yet enabled | n/a (new state) | <img width="280" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-11 at 3 48 50 PM" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/102106810/9a67e34c-74e0-4ac7-b88e-d8804535ce91"> | This is a new alert that will appear when the Veteran has selected to skip turning on push in the initial onboarding flow. We're essentially giving them the option again. We've reused wording from the initial context-setting screen but truncated it for this alert. Again, we excluded the header in the alert to reduce redundancy in wording. We also used the body copy to remind Veterans what notifications they get (appointments and messages). |  Misty Milliron-Grant | 03/12/2024 |
