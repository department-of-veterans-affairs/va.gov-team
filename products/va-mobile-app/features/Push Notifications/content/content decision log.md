# Content decision log - Push notifications
While the content needs for push notifications project were small, we used this opportunity to review the end-to-end experience for Veterans when (1) initially being asked to turn on notifications and (2) subsequent encounters with push notification capabilities. Below are before and after screenshots of current content we're updating and screenshots of new screens/content we're suggesting.

| Before            | After (or net new)         | Explanation        | Decision made by | Date                 |

But it is a screen that appears before a new context-setting screen for push. Therefore, we want a similar content structure for both screens. For both, we also want to bring forward the benefits of enabling these functionalities instead of just asking Veterans to turn them on. The updated content speaks to the value Face ID provides: easier sign in. We updated the copy in the second body copy sentence to remind Veterans they are in control of this functionality and can change it at any time. |  Misty Milliron-Grant | 03/12/2024 |
| n/a (new state) | <img width="222" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-11 at 10 58 32 AM" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/102106810/8afd4728-bb19-45d9-8a6e-27c429b251a9"> | This is a new screen to help set context for what Veterans will get out of push notifications. Similar to the Face ID screen, we used the header to communicate the benefit of push (staying updated). We purposefully left the benefit statement somewhat vague in the header and used the body copy to give more details on the benefits (i.e., specific push notifications Veterans get). We also chose the phrase "app notifications". "Push notifications" is jargon, and we can't be sure a Veteran knows what a "push" means without testing. We used the body copy to explain that these are notifications sent to a device vs. text or email. We also explicitly tell Veterans what pushes they'll get (appointments and messages). As we enable more pushes, this copy will need to be updated. Finally, like with the Face ID screen, we added a sentence explaining that Veterans can change notifications any time, giving them the power to control this functionality. | Misty Milliron-Grant | 03/12/2024 |

Previously, it included redundant headings and unhelpful copy. After confirming with Accessibility, we decided to remove the subheading and update the body copy to further remind Veterans how these notifications will be received (to their device). We also added an external link that tells Veterans where they can go to manage their email/text notifications. Finally, as part of this work, we worked with VEText team to update the API-pulled copy for the toggles. This copy is now more aligned with VA content style guide. |  Misty Milliron-Grant | 03/12/2024 |

This alert appears when a Veteran has not enabled push. At this point, to enable, a Veteran must now go to their device settings to do so. Improvements here include using a "slim alert" without a header to reduce redundancy, updating body copy to remind Veterans these are "app" notifications, and updating button copy to be more clear (device settings not app settings). We've also included the external link for managing email/text notifications on VA.gov. |  Misty Milliron-Grant | 03/12/2024 |

We're essentially giving them the option again. We've reused wording from the initial context-setting screen but truncated it for this alert. Again, we excluded the header in the alert to reduce redundancy in wording. We also used the body copy to remind Veterans what notifications they get (appointments and messages). |  Misty Milliron-Grant | 03/12/2024 |
