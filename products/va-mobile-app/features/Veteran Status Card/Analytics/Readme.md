### MVP 
- No new unique events were created as the buttons / pages we are using will automatically create a new page event that can be tracked. 

### Post MVP 
- Identified an opportunity to include some kind of question to the Veteran after accessing Proof of Veteran Status to see if the feature is working as expected
- Presented thought and mockups (in Figma file) to POs and they were originally interested in pursuing post launch; however later decided to hold off as the project needed external approvals and also a separate contract was being purused by the VA on this
