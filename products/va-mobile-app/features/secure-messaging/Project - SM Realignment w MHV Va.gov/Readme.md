## Changes release 
 - Incremental changes were made between May and July 

## Purpose:

- Copy changes to align with sitewide content
- Attaching a file UX and attaching a file alerts
- Adding conversation threading and aligning with the UX in web
- Adding tracking to understand how Veterans use subject/category for SM
- Improve inline error handling
- Adding additional Cerner error messages while modifying others
- Align with sitewide content / web on handling When will I get a reply
- Release / implementing changes as we go

## Actions
 - Misty (Content) worked with engineering to get access to make PRs for copy changes
 - Misty and Lauren worked together on formulating design / copy changes (see mural board below)
 - Inclusion of threading which MHV SM was starting to introduce

## Findings:
- Threading - MHV does not support threading for folders / inbox at this time
