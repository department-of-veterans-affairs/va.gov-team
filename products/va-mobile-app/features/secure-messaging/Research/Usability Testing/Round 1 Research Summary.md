# Research Summary for Usability Testing of VA MVP Mobile App Secure Messaging Prototype R1

March, 2021

## Background and goals

The Secure Messaging VA Mobile App team conducted testing to understand usability obstacles, ask questions, and get feedback from Veterans on an MVP secure messaging feature we are developing. This testing informs the approach and implementation of Secure Messaging in the MVP mobile app.

## Participant summary

We recruited 12 participants and spoke 7 participants who can be described as following:

- Participants were in the following age ranges: (1) 25-34, (1) 35-44, (1) 45-64, (2) 55-64, (2) 65-74 
- All used VA health care
- 6 participants had a service-connected disability rating, ranging from 10% to 100% 
- Geographic breakdown of participants was: (3) major metropolitan area, (4) rural or remote area
- Gender breakdown 4 Male, 3 Female
- Two participants identified cognitive consideration of PTSD or TBI
- We did not test with non-sighted users due to limitations of the prototype technology
- Although an important user group, we did not test with Caregivers
- One participant looked at the prototype on their mobile phone, 5 participants looked at the prototype on their computers, 1 participant looked at the prototype on the moderators screen

## Research goals

Summary of our high-level research goals:

- What experiences and issues do Veterans have when communicating with VA and outside providers?
- What are the Veteran key experiences and issues with Secure Messaging on the web?
- Determine effectiveness and clarity of the app IA and navigation UI.
- Validate that Veterans can easily find Inbox, Folders / Sent Messages, View Messages and Reply, and Compose a Message. What patterns and obstacles exist in finding them?
- What is the Veteran perception of the prototype overall?

## Findings

### What experiences and issues do Veterans have when communicating with VA and outside providers?

Participants utilize VA services online daily to weekly depending on the task. Users mentioned frustrations around login in to access VA benefits and health care. The majority of participants also expressed frustrations when calling care providers, mentioning long wait and hold times, getting bounced around, not being able to connect with the correct person, and confusion over phone menu options.

> “The website is just annoying, I have to authenticate like 18 different times.” - P2

> “If I call the VA I get bounced around to different places. ” - P6

**Implications:**

- Feedback from participants on login reinforces previous research that has shown biometric login in the app will be highly valuable

### What are the Veteran key experiences and issues with Secure Messaging on the web?

Secure Messaging is used for a variety of health tasks including managing prescriptions, communicating about tests, managing appointments, and ordering prosthetics. Participants especially liked the convenience and efficiency that Secure Messaging affords. Participants had a high level of trust in Secure Messaging and was preferred over phone calls. Several participants liked that Secure Messaging acted as a record of communication with their providers. Participants had varying expectations and experiences with message response times, and who they might hear from in their care team. When talking about urgent or immediate communication participants indicated they would call their providers. 

> “Secure messaging is more predictable than trying to reach somebody by phone” - P4

> “When I call on the phone I don't know if the doc gets the message, but online I know they got the message.” - P7

> “If I have a question for my doctor, no matter what time it is, I can just send a message and I don’t have to wait for a returned call. I don’t have to wait for office hours.” - P5

### Determine the effectiveness and clarity of the app IA and navigation UI.

When asked all participants navigated to the Health screen when prompted to find Messages. On the Healths screen when asked what was missing 3 participants mentioned Prescriptions, and 2 participants mentioned Health Records. All participants understood and used the back navigation. Two participants suggested adding icons as additional waypoints for navigation. One participant wanted a back navigation option on the Health screen. 

> “Very easy, I think it’s straightforward.” - P5

**Implications:**

- Consider future discovery on how to set expectations and notify app users of upcoming features.
- Consider exploring additional navigation cues as future features are implemented.

### Validate that Veterans can easily find Inbox, Folders / Sent Messages, View Messages and Reply, and Compose a Message. What patterns and obstacles exist in finding them?

#### Inbox: 

All participants easily found the Inbox. Participants didn’t have any issues when given tasks to find unread and messages with attachments. Some participants were confused when demo content did match their own experiences with Secure Messaging. 

> "It would be good to know what clinic she is messaging from." - P7 

**Implications:**

- Testing with real users’ data will be valuable in the future.

#### Folders / Sent messages:

Most participants indicated it was very clear where to find Folders. Five participants utilize the Sent folder for various reasons including verifying their message was sent, wanting to have a record of the conversation for future reference, wanting to see how long ago they sent something, and confirming a message was read by the provider. Two participants indicated using Custom Folders. None of the participants mentioned any expectation on managing Folders in the app. Two participants indicated that Trash [Delete] was missing from the Folders section and was something they used as part of their messaging workflow. 

> “If no one got back to me, I would check this to keep track as a record of communications” - P2

**Implications:**

- Include “Read” label on Sent messages.
- Delete folder is on the future roadmap.

#### View Message and Reply:

Most participants were able to find and open an unread message and found the message looked as expected. Participants valued seeing message threads as a good record of a communication. Participants easily found the reply button when asked how they would reply to a specific message. All the participants were easily able to find and open a message with an attachment. Some participants were confused when demo content did match their own experiences. 

> The participant found it easily “because it had the paperclip on it.” - P2

**Implications:**

- Testing with real user’s data will be valuable in the future.

#### Compose a Message: 

When tasked participants easily found the Compose a Message button. None of the participants were confused by the form saying that it was straightforward and what they expected. Participants liked knowing when to expect a response. Two participants suggested adding a Subject of “Other”. One participant wanted to add a Draft button.

> “There's a place to address the message, fill out the subject, and compose, it's good" - P3

**Implications:**

- Planned - Drafts are on the future roadmap.

### What is the Veteran perception of the prototype overall?

Overall the prototype was well received by all participants. Participants mentioned that the app was clean, user friendly, and straightforward. Participants were most excited about the convenience of using the app.

- “This is more streamlined. It can be quite busy on the website, a lot of different options that you don’t need.” - P5 
- “If I’m home, I can do it right on my phone. It makes it easier.” - P1

**Implications:**

- While the prototype tested well and there was not a need for any substantial changes we are documenting anything for post-MVP and future considerations. 

### Other findings

**Notifications:** Participants had varying expectations around new message notifications some which were specific to the mobile experience.

> I would like to have a banner popup, or just some type of alert on my phone that just says new message in VA app. - P2

**Coming soon:**  Participants expressed that they would be interested in knowing when new features come out and would like to be notified when they do.

>“I would expect to get an email about the app that says more features are coming.” - P6

**Implications:**

- Planned - Notifications are on the future roadmap.
- Consider future discovery on how to set expectations and notify app users of upcoming features.

## Future research opportunities

We think the following areas would be beneficial to look into in the future: 

**Real user data:** Participants expressed confusion around the demo content. It will be helpful for the participants to be able to see their own information and see if new issues arise. 

**Drafts and Deleted Folder:** Since these are on the roadmap we would value more research specifically on these folders and users’ workflows. 

**Folks who use assistive technology:** There have been challenges finding an inclusive distribution method to test an unpublished mobile app that will be accessible to set up for users who use assistive technology.

**Getting input from Caregivers:** Caregivers have a different workflow and may find certain features more necessary like a forwarding feature for example. 

**Communicating that more features will come:** Test ways we can communicate in the app that it is a first release and more features will come over time.
