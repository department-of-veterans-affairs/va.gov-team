## Introduction (2 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Jen and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. The VA is building a mobile app and I am working with the VA to ensure the app is easy to use and meets the needs of Veterans like you. Today, I’m looking to share with you an early version of Secure Messaging, which is one section of the mobile app we’re working on, and see what you think about it.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take a little less than an hour. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.**
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
- **We will be looking at early designs of a mobile app today.** These are just pictures, or a mockup, of how the app might be designed. So since it's not a working app it might not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the design will be tapable, and some will not, but none of your actions or input will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **Even though we’re looking at design mockups, Secure Messaging is a health tool, and health can be a personal topic.** I don't expect you to talk about aspects of your own health if you are not comfortable. And if I ask a question you’d rather not answer, please just let me know and we can skip it.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

***Start recording.***

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?**

## Warm up (10 minutes)

- Before we look at anything you tell me a little bit about yourself?
    - What branch of the military did you serve in and when was your period or periods of service?

    - Do you remember the last time you used them?
    - How often do you use them?

    - Is there anything you would change about it?
    - Do you remember was the last time you reached out?

Thank you for sharing all that.

## Tech Set Up (5 minutes)

Now I’m going to ask you to start sharing your screen with me via Zoom. When you are inside the Zoom app on your phone, you'll see a few buttons at the bottom of the screen. In the middle, there should be a big green button labeled Share Content. Do you see it? I'd like you to share your screen with me! I can walk you through what to do. If you see any additional prompts different from what I am describing, please read them aloud and I will help: Tap on the arrow that says "Share".

- A menu should come up with options of what to share - please hit "Screen".
- You should be prompted with an option to select what you'd like to share - please select "Zoom". You may see a message asking if you'd like to start recording or casting with Zoom. If you are comfortable with your screen being recorded, please hit "Start now".
- Do you see a message asking if you would like to allow Zoom to display over other apps?
    - If yes, please select "Allow Zoom to display over other apps"
- The next thing you should see is a button for "Start Broadcast".
- Ok, tap anywhere on the screen to go back to the Zoom application.

Great, now I can see your phone screen! Thank you for your patience in figuring this out with me so we can look at this together today.

*Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:*

- Ok, it seems like we're having some trouble getting the mockup up on your screen. I still want to get your help and feedback, so what we're going to do today is have me share my screen, and then I'm going to have you "drive". You will tell me what to do, what to tap, on, etc. Does that sound ok? [Share your screen]. Can you confirm if you can see my screen?

Great.

- Alright, I am sending you a link in the chat. Can you navigate to the Chat button, and tap on the link to open it? [Participant opens prototype]

Great, I can see your screen. Before we get started I just want to remind you that this is just a design mockup - not everything is tapable and it's a demo of what is to come. And if you could keep in mind to think out loud since you’re on a phone and I can’t see your mouse cursor.

## Home and Health Screens (5 minutes)

Now I’d like to ask you to try out some tasks within the design so we can learn how we can improve it. I’m not testing you or your ability, but testing the design. We want to understand if anything isn't clear so we can make it better.

Go ahead and open the VA mobile app and sign in.

- *Do they say anything about the simulated sign in?*

[On Home screen]: Briefly, before we get into Secure Messaging I am wondering if you can take a minute to look at this screen

- What is your first impression of what you see here?
- What questions do you have about what you see here?

**Task 1 (Find Secure Messaging CTA Button):** Let’s imagine you had this app on your phone. Where would you go to find your new messages? Can you tell me what made you pick that?

- *Do they find the Health section?*

[On Health screen]: Before you tap anywhere take a look at this screen.

- Is the information here what you expect it to be?
- Does it feel like anything is missing here?
- Would you add anything to this screen? Why?

Things to watch for & follow up on if participant brings it up:

- *What does the participant say about the Home screen?*
- *What does the participant say about the Health screen?*
- *Does the participant ask about any of the other features (Claims, Appointments, etc)?*

## Inbox & View Message (5 minutes)

**Task 2 (Find Secure Messaging):** Going back to that scenario - where would you go to find your new messages?

- *Do they find the Inbox?*

[On Inbox screen]: Before you tap anywhere take a look at this screen.

- Is the information here what you expect it to be?
- Does it feel like anything is missing here?
- Would you add anything to this screen? Why?
- What is the most important thing you look for when you get a new message? (if participant gets stuck: provider, subject, subject line, date)
    - Why is that?
    - Is the time a message is sent important information for you? Why or why not?
- If you had a new message how would you expect to get notified? Why?

**Task 3 (View Unread Message)**: Can you find and open an unread message from Dr. Susan Smith?

- *Do they open the correct message?*

[On View Message screen]

- Is the information here what you expect it to be?
- Does it feel like anything is missing here?
- Would you add anything to this screen? Why?
- What would you do to reply to this message? Is replying to a message common?

If the participant cannot find something:

- It's alright, let's move on to the next thing I'd like to talk to you about, or:
- Can you tell me a little bit about what you're thinking? I'd love to hear from you about where you'd expect to see this information.

Things to watch for & follow up on if participant brings it up:

- *Is anything difficult to find?*
- *Did the participant select the correct message?*

**Task 4 (View Message with Attachment)**: Now can you go back to the Inbox? 

- *Do they go struggle to go back to the Inbox?*

[On Inbox screen] Do you see any message that would have an attachment?

- *Do they find the correct message?*

[On View Message screen]

- Is the information here what you expect it to be?
- Does it feel like anything is missing here?
- Would you add anything to this screen? Why?

## Folders/Sent Messages (5 minutes)

**Task 5 (View Folders/ Sent Messages):** If you wanted to view your sent messages where would you go?

- *Do they open the Folder section?*

[On View Message screen]:

- Do you typically look at your Sent messages?
    - Why or why not?
- Do you think it makes sense to have Sent messages here?
    - Why or why not?
- Do you use custom folders?
    - Why or why not?
    - If yes, how do you typically use them?
    - If yes, would you find them useful in this mobile app?
- Is the information here what you expect it to be?
- Does it feel like anything is missing here?
- Would you add anything to this screen? Why?

If the participant cannot find something:

- Feel free to look around if you’re just curious as well.
- It's alright, let's move on to the next thing I'd like to talk to you about, or:
- Can you tell me a little bit about what you're thinking? I'd love to hear from you about where you'd expect to see this information.

Things to watch for & follow up on if participant brings it up

- *Is anything difficult to find?*
- *Does the participant ask about the Drafts or Deleted folders? How about Search?*
- *If they struggled to use the in-screen tab navigation, probe on that.*
- *Is the participant using the 'Back' button alright, or getting stuck?*

## Compose Message (5 minutes)

**Last Task 6 (Compose a Message):** Looking at this screen where would you go to compose a message?

- *Do they tap the Compose a Message button?*

[On Compose a Message screen]:

- Is the information here what you expect it to be?
- Does it feel like anything is missing here?
- Would you add anything to this screen? Why?
- When you compose a message to your provider do you usually use the Subject Line field?
    - If yes, what kind of information do you put in there?
    - If no, why?
- When you use your phone to type do you use your keyboard or do you use voice dictation?
    - Would voice dictation be useful for you?


## Free exploration (5 minutes)

Thank you for letting me ask you to get around Secure Messaging! Now you're in charge. Feel free to click around - anywhere you'd like to go. As you're exploring, I'm here to answer any questions you have. I'd also love to hear what you think if you're comfortable talking out loud as you explore.

- Do you have any questions for me about anything you see?

I'd like to learn from you a bit about how you feel about everything we've talked about today.

- How do you think this compares to Secure Messaging on the MHV website?
- Do you think this mobile app would change how you message your providers?
    - If yes, how would it change?
- Let's imagine again you are talking to a friend who is also a Veteran about this and you’re telling them about it. What would you say about it?
- Let's say you could add 1 more thing to this messaging feature - what would you add? Why?

## Wrap up (2 minutes)

That’s all the questions I have for you today. Do you have any last questions for me?

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on VA’s mobile app and make sure it really works for Veterans like you. Enjoy the rest of your day!
