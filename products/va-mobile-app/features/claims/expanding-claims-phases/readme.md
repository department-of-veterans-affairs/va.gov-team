# Mobile Claims Phase Expansion, Q2 2024

## Project Summary
* We're going to expand the claims phases within the mobile [disability claims feature](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/features/claims-discovery/Claims%20Reimagined%20Product%20Brief.md), to provide more context for veterans and to create affinity with the [Improved Claims Process Understanding Initiative](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/claim-appeal-status/CST%20Product/Improved%20Claims%20Process%20Understanding%20Initiative.md) that the web team is working on.

## Why (Borrowed from [web](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/claim-appeal-status/CST%20Product/Improved%20Claims%20Process%20Understanding%20Initiative.md))
### Problem Statement(s)

* As a veteran navigating an open disability claim, I lack clarity regarding the VA's responsibilities versus my own at various stages in the claims process, which creates uncertainty and may lead to redundant or misguided actions on my part.
* As a veteran involved in the disability claims process, I often miss opportunities to contribute effectively to my claim due to a lack of understanding about my specific responsibilities at different stages in the process.
* As a veteran with an open disability claim, my preconceived expectations about the claims process frequently clash with the reality, causing me to become frustrated when the claim stagnates at a particular phase, or unexpectedly reverts to a previous phase.
* As a veteran engaging with the CST for my open disability claim, I encounter specific evidence requests whose purpose and requirements are unclear to me, leading to delays in response and submissions that may not be as strong as they could be.
* As a veteran tracking my open disability claim through the [mobile] CST, I am misled by the depicted claims process timeline, which incorrectly suggests a linear process and fails to illustrate the common occurrence of claims cycling between phases. This inaccuracy creates false expectations and compounds the difficulty of waiting for results.


### Desired Outcomes

* Veterans have a clear understanding of the claims process, their responsibilities, and the VA's responsibilities at each stage.
* Veterans can easily differentiate between their own tasks and those of the VA at each stage of the claims process.
* Veterans understand why specific evidence is requested and what constitutes strong evidence, leading to more timely and effective submissions.
* The [mobile] CST provides a more accurate depiction of the claims process, better aligning veterans' expectations with the reality of claim progression.
