# Project Kickoff - Expanding Claims Phases on Mobile

### Project summary

### Technical notes
* Where are there dependencies between team?
    *  We'll want to make sure our release plans are alligned
* Are test users available to the mobile team?
* Are there any breaking changes expected in upstream APIs?
    * No, we should already have the new phase data from Lighthouse
 
### Risks
* Making sure the release plans are aligned
    * Is web planning a staged/phased rollout? If so, how would we accomodate that?
* Will there be any press releases? If so, should we prepare for an influx of traffic?
* Will we updating any of the static content pages related to claims phases?
