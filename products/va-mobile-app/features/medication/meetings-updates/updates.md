Review MHV Medications API Changes With Latest VistA Patch

A new VistA patch is being rolled out nationally in the next month that will allow us to add some new data to the medications API

* Patch is planned to go out this week
* New fields being added 
  * Field particularly relevant for mobile 'Reason for use.' This is a required field that providers must populate to order script(s); it provides users with information about why they are taking X medication and is sometimes shown with SIG (medication instructions).  
    * Field to be added to RX API
    *  MHV plans to add new field on the web
    *  Asked for mobile to be included in requirement session to understand how the field is planned to be incorporated.  Raquel will have Tanner share requirements doc..
  * Fields such as refill request date & Last process date, will help with refillable logic (nothing that mobile needs to do for this, but this will help with future changes that are needed to address some of the issues with isrefillable/not refillable logic)

Inquiry was made surrounding roadmapping/prioritization of the VA Health & Benefits app displaying Non-VA Meds.  This would be a higher priority item for Dr. Spahn, advised would share this with Rachel accordingly.
