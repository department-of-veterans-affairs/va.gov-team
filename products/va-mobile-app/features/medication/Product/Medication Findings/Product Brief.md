## Epic

[6041](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app/issues/6041)

## Purpose:
Determine the best way for Veterans to find their prescriptions.

**Problem:**

How might we help Veterans easily find and manage their meds (i.e which do they need more of, what actions should they take)?

**Question to answer:** 

Would adding a search &/or scan functionality on the mobile app better support Veterans in finding the prescriptions they need faster and with ease?

**Focus Market research** on Scan Feature used by other Commercial Apps (i.e. Retail Pharmacy & Mail Order Pharmacy)

- What are other commercial apps are doing
- How have they incorporated scan
- Those commercial apps that have also included search functionality
- What are the differences from Retail Pharmacy & Mail order pharmacy
- What are some of the reasoning that retail pharmacy put scan in place

Out of Scope

- Direct user research

**After Demo Feedback:**

Ryan:
- using a scanner to refill
- using a scanner to enter non-VA meds
- using a scanner to enable script talk
dr spahn's list of things scanning is good for

**Rachel:** 

1. - my thoughts, which is really about matching a problem statement and solution.
using scanning to solve the problem of refill in authenticated state: not the best solution. we have research of commercial and mail order apps to show scanning works in unauth state for refills and to drive up store revenue/users to get products in person. we have quant data from RxR to support this conclusion. usage of scanning in RxR, auth state is 5%
2. - scanning for patients to enter non-VA meds: this is not a problem the app solves, as patients don't self-enter data
3. - using scanning to address low/blind users needs: a match in problem statement (veterans need and VA need) and solution that we will consider for future roadmap input. problem: veterans with low/blind vision need refills, med list, how to take meds, and VA needs an alternative option to script talk machines.

  right now, we are prioritizing aligning web/mobile on prescriptions. later, dive deeper into #3
