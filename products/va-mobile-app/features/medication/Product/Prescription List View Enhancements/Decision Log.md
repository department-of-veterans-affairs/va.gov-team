## Decision Log
This will be used to track all the major decisions made over the course of the project. 
It explains the reasons for each decision, so team members can identify their original motivations in case of confusion, disagreements, or unexpected changes to the project.

|Date|Inquiry/Question|Decision/Answer|
|--------|:-----------|:-------------|
**2/29/24** | Final changes are merged into the codebase for release on 3/12 | All tickets related to this work have been completed and tested, and the code was merged. Kaitlin Fink provided approval on the work in the [epic](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app/issues/7487). See [Slack thread](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C018V2JCWRJ/p1709058144052409) for additional conversation.
**9/5/23** | Problem C: Two statuses that need to be deleted from mobile filter list & logic: Active Suspended & Non-Verified.  When a prescription is in suspended status, the API sends it as refill in process; hence mobile will not receive a status Active: Suspended. Per Dr. Sphan'non-verified' we've never shown those b/c they are not useful to users and are <500 compared to the approx 18-20million prescription statuses within one year query.  Ticket [4906](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app/issues/4906#issuecomment-1707220696) created to address.  Next step confirming ok to move forward| Notification provided to Dr. Spahn and Sirisha on 9/6 that mobile would be removing the statuses.  Thumbs up provided by both.

|9/14/23| **Problem D:** Veterans know that medications documented but not dispensed by a VA pharmacy is not listed in app, so they can use the list to . Veterans may not understand the app’s usage of “VA prescriptions.” Many of those non-VA meds are prescribed by VA Providers and sent to non-VA pharmacies so they are technically VA prescriptions (just not dispensed by VA) **Proposed Copy Change** 1. Copy on All tab to now read: "This list only shows prescriptions filled by VA pharmacies and isn't intended to be a plan of care." 2. Adding a bullet to the large panel help that reads: "Prescriptions filled at non-VA pharmacies" <img width="1173" alt="Screenshot 2023-09-14 at 2 47 30 PM" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/90273080/09b7e721-9574-4e2d-9d16-a3d5872784c0">  Confirm w/ Rach that the recommendation is ok to move forward with change.  Rachel confirmed 11/20 that a Notification was shared in public channel #mhv-medications-rx on Sept 20th. Mobile [ticket](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/va-mobile-60f1a34998bc75000f2a489f/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app/6804). Additional slack threads related to this include [Thread one on 9/20](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C04PRFEJQTY/p1695217186854019) and [Thread two on 9/20](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C04PRFEJQTY/p1695221854159459)
|9/14/23| Explore if there are other places within Prescriptions that we can surface the information that we currently display in help.  The info we currently display in help explains that our list doesn't actually include every/all medications a Veteran may have ever come into contact with.  What are other alternatives to showing this information (i.e. displaying a link to a large panel some where on the screen vs. in help info)| |
|9/29/23| Problem A: Veterans struggle to review their full list of prescriptions to identify the correct prescription they were looking to refill. Problem B: When a filter is on, header 1 and header 2 counts are unequal. Share updated design recommendation with Rachel & Ryan and determine next steps i.e. move forward with proposed design (meeting scheduled 10/3/23|
|11/20/23| Kay informed Mobile that Dr. Spahn has approved of the changes when meeting with him on 11/16.  [Slack Thread w/ Figma designs and discussions](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C02M11AKKNU/p1698850262942459?thread_ts=1698849712.471259&cid=C02M11AKKNU). Dr. Spah mentioned 2 pieces of feedback he was hoping to get adjusted before launch. However Kay/Rachel/Coulton agreed that it was not needed before launch and Mobile can proceed with the proposed changes as needed.  Feedback and rationale for them can be found in the thread. <img width="552" alt="image" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/116006847/cc96df61-11e7-4894-ab3c-b39f88cd1e65">
|11/20/23| Rachel confirmed that priority on implementing this work is up for discussion. Currently Appointment and Messages changes are deemed more important than RX. If info says RX then can switch direction. Given this Mobile proceeding just with finishing up appointments and will only size RX work. No implementation timeline known|
