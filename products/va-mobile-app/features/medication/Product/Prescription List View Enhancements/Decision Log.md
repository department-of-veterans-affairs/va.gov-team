## Decision Log
This will be used to track all the major decisions made over the course of the project. 
It explains the reasons for each decision, so team members can identify their original motivations in case of confusion, disagreements, or unexpected changes to the project.

|Date|Inquiry/Question|Decision/Answer|
|--------|:-----------|:-------------|
**9/5/23** | Problem C: Two statuses that need to be deleted from mobile filter list & logic: Active Suspended & Non-Verified.  When a prescription is in suspended status, the API sends it as refill in process; hence mobile will not receive a status Active: Suspended. Per Dr. Sphan'non-verified' we've never shown those b/c they are not useful to users and are <500 compared to the approx 18-20million prescription statuses within one year query.  Ticket [4906](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app/issues/4906#issuecomment-1707220696) created to address.  Next step confirming ok to move forward| Notification provided to Dr. Spahn and Sirisha on 9/6 that mobile would be removing the statuses.  Thumbs up provided by both.

|9/14/23| **Problem D:** Veterans know that medications documented but not dispensed by a VA pharmacy is not listed in app, so they can use the list to . Veterans may not understand the app’s usage of “VA prescriptions.” Many of those non-VA meds are prescribed by VA Providers and sent to non-VA pharmacies so they are technically VA prescriptions (just not dispensed by VA) **Proposed Copy Change** 1. Copy on All tab to now read: "This list only shows prescriptions filled by VA pharmacies and isn't intended to be a plan of care." 2. Adding a bullet to the large panel help that reads: "Prescriptions filled at non-VA pharmacies" <img width="1173" alt="Screenshot 2023-09-14 at 2 47 30 PM" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/90273080/09b7e721-9574-4e2d-9d16-a3d5872784c0">  Confirm w/ Rach that the recommendation is ok to move forward with change.  
|9/14/23| Explore if there are other places within Prescriptions that we can surface the information that we currently display in help.  The info we currently display in help explains that our list doesn't actually include every/all medications a Veteran may have ever come into contact with.  What are other alternatives to showing this information (i.e. displaying a link to a large panel some where on the screen vs. in help info)| |
