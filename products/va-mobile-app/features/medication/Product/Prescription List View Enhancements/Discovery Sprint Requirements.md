# Background

Veterans use the VA: Health and Benefits mobile app, Prescriptions feature to get two jobs done:

- 1 job: request and track refills.
- 2 job: view list of medications and details of a medication.

## Problem A: 
Veterans struggle to review their full list of prescriptions to identify the correct prescription they were looking to refill.

Participants did not use any other prescription status besides Active to determine what to refill. When prompted to define them, participants provided their own interpretation when scanning the list and the Filter options.

See more info in Artifacts, “Post Rx launch research findings” below.

Veterans view a list of “actionable” scripts, defined as medications they currently take or are looking to refill, without having to use “Filter by.”

**Proposed Solution**

As a veteran, I easily view scripts I’m currently taking or am looking to refill.

1. Status quo, no change to veteran’s view of Health/Prescriptions default list
2. Change default list to all Active statuses. Use plain language content to lead veterans to see other scripts.
3. All Active statuses as a group. Keep option to select individual Active status. Provide option to clear filter from default list view.

**Action:** Team to review and provide recommendation.

## Problem B: 

When a filter is on, header 1 and header 2 counts are unequal. 

Solution to consider: Update second header, so it’s dynamic. E.g. 13 of 31

**Action:** Team to review and provide recommendation.

## Problem C:

Two statuses need to be deleted:

- Active: Suspended - the app isn't getting this status from API
- Non-verified

**Action:** MHV backend team, Yeruva, Sirisha V., to confirm that these statuses are no longer available. https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C04PRFEJQTY/p1693235183889379 (Confirmed by Sirisha)

**Next Step:**
- Mobile to create backlog ticket to remove statuses
- Notified Sirisha & Dr. Spahn that mobile will be removing the 2 statuses (see: [decision log](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/features/medication/Product/Prescription%20List%20View%20Enhancements/Decision%20Log.md) for details)

## Problem D:

Veterans know that medications documented but not dispensed by a VA pharmacy is not listed in app, so they can use the list to . 
Veterans may not understand the app’s usage of “VA prescriptions.” Many of those non-VA meds are prescribed by VA Providers and sent to non-VA pharmacies so they are technically VA prescriptions (just not dispensed by VA)

Proposed Solution: Update “Help” content
