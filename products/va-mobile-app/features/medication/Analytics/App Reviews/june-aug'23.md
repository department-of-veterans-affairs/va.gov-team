|Android|This app is incredibly easy to use; it's organized; and it's also not glitchy (for me). **I use it exclusively to refill my meds** and message my doctor. The app is very quick and responsive. The "Service Letters" section (once complete) gives you access to your all your military/veteran/disability/commissary letters. *** Note to VA: Please fix the "Service Letters" module. I'm getting the 'Please Try Again' response for each letter.|
|Android|Very helpful for making appointments and refilling prescriptions. Perhaps the best feature is being able to communicate with my health care providers through MyHealthVet.|
|Android|no med reorder or tracking? push notifications?|

|iOS|There is very limited information on the app. The upcoming appointments are never loaded. The claims process is never working. **If you want to access prescriptions or view/send messages- it works well.**|
|iOS|This app is a game changer! I would give it 5 stars but in the last few months my appointments stopped populating in the App. I was using it to add my appointments directly to my calendar and to keep me on track. With all of the different appointmentstimes and dates it gets very confusing very quickly. If you can please fix the Appointments functionality on the App I would sincerely appreciate it. \n\nBesides the appointments the App is outstanding. **I use it to see the status of my claimstrack and refill my prescriptionsmessage** my providersdownload lettersand even track my payments history. Once the appointment functionality is working again I would say that this is one ofif not the mostimportant App on my phone.
|Android|I've edited this review from 1 star to 4. The negatives are fewer, and the app is getting better. I now use it from my phone vs. the browser as i can do most of what i need. When typing messages, the message box can jump down and get hidden. There are no medical records downloading or viewing except vaccinations. Once logged in, you can opt in to fingerprint login, which is very convenient. But, don't logout just close the app. otherwise, you'll need to log in again. **Big pluses are Rx renewals**
|Android|very useful for quick account checks and prescription refills.|
|Android|Easy to keep track of meds, appointments and messaging your Dr and Nurse!|
|Android|Can whoever is in charge of making updates to the app, please add an option to reach your team in the event of the app mot qorking correctly. Rather than having to come here to update comments to get an issue fixed. Also, please consider adding travel with the option to choose each month separately to file. **And I way to request prescription refill from our doctors without having to call or email.**
|iOS|Love how the last picture is a RX of Adderall|

|iOS|Thank you for this app!  It makes checking appointmentsprescriptionsbenefits all in one place.  This makes managing this part of my life so much easier.
|Android|Very convenient app. I can check the status on my claims and medication refills instantly.
|iOS|This app has multi purpose features that allow users to communicate directly with their doctorsview VA lettersclaim statusvaccine records**medication list**. Downloadable letters for outside the VA system requirements.
|iOS|It would be nice to be able to download my vaccination information to a .CSV.PDFfile format for my personal records. The information is mineabout meand therefore I should have access. Same goes for lettersRxmessages. I think it’s my data and I should have the right to use it as I see fit. Other apps allow you to download your information. For instanceMyHealthyVet or whatever the name is called. **\n\nThen the pharmacy refill section. It would be nice to sort active or inactive prescriptions. Usually I am looking to refill active prescriptions and not see an entire list of inactive prescriptions with my active prescriptions. It becomes cumbersome to sort through and find the active prescriptions you want to refill.** **\n\nAlsowith your announcement that the Rx Refill App is going awayprovide a link to the app you wish me to use. Or short instructions on how to get the app. For exampleIn the Apple App Storeyou have to search by the Department of Veterans Affairs to find the plethora of apps available. Maybe check and make sure out of date apps are not being listed.** \n\nThis app needs improvement to make it useful and easy to find the correct information. Being able to save my info to my cloud drive or print is essential. As when at the Charles George VA Medical Center there are way to many dead zones to pull up the app. Alsothe WIFI Guest feature is a nightmare to loginstay connectedand over filtered to the point of being useless. Well it is useless and then the going cellular network only is full of dead zones in the building. The censorship is deplorable as we are adults and children are not allowed. To think of all the veterans that fought to protect the Constitution and Freedom in the US only to get muzzled by their own government.
|iOS|PRO: **Great APP to manage benifitsquick review of records**and manage claims / appointments.**\n\nCON:  it does not replace the website!  Two examples\n\nMedical Support:  \nCon: medical records - do online.  There was a second app required with mix results.  \n\nCon: RX support on VA app “VA Rx Refill” / PRO this app works great.** \n\nPro : DM to clinics and specialists for follow up questions / submit info / set up appointments.  \nCon : Appointments are listed with physical location of hospital or clinic.  But no details of DR / reason / quick ref phone (so many extensions).  Also no DM / Cancel / Reschedule option. \n\n4 stars for the above reasons. But huge improvement over the years.  Big issue is the VA is trying to use this as the on stop fix.  Elderly Vets and family support have hard time with it.  The VA system is over whelmed so it’s a 5th Star potential for effort.  This app is a must.  It always gets better over time.
|Android|I have not had any issuses with this app. It is convenient to send messages, check my claim status, and refill my prescriptions.
|Android|A good app, and fairly easy to navigate. **I would like to see prescription tracking notifications added.** This app tracks just about everything, so I decided to try it. Glad I did. Also, the biometrics allows much faster logging in.
|Android|This VA app is fine for everything EXCEPT RX Refills. For RX Refills this app is unacceptable. The old VA RX Refill app ain't broke, don't fix it.
|iOS|**Does not appear to have all the functionality of VA RX Refill.** Seems we are being forced to use this app even though it does not have everything the app it is replacing offers. It’s a shame.  Let’s get those included so we can manage our health better. Thanks.
|iOS|**I had used the VA’s prescriptionrefill app in the pastbut this app is more comprehensiveeasier to useseems to work fasterand apparently has some cool features.** I especially like the appointmentreminder notificationsand the notifications when you have received a secure message. Those two features alone are very worthwhile.

|[Ordering Refills on the VA App](https://www.reddit.com/r/Veterans/comments/16mpes2/ordering_refills_on_the_va_app/) - If you order a prescription refill in the VA app does that automatically mean it will get mailed out to me? I don’t recall seeing any options to choose I’m just assuming it will eventually get mailed out.|
