2. Identify major usability or content issues with the current concept of viewing prescription history and tracking prescriptions


## Introduction - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Esther and I have a few people on the team who are interested in listening in to our session as observers. They’re in the virtual waiting room right now. It’s completely fine if you choose to have the session without observers, so let me know what you’d prefer.

* If yes: _Let observers join with their video on. Each observer can come off mute and introduce themselves, and then go back on mute with video off_

Today we're going to talk about managing prescriptions with the VA mobile app. Our team is working to improve the app and and this is one of the the things we're hoping to add in the future. We'll have a short discussion first, and then I'll have you take a look at a simulation of what this might look like. Do you have any questions at this point?

Great! Before we start, a few things I want to mention:
* **This entire session should take about an hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
* **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. There’s no right or wrong answers and I will not be offended by any opinions you express. I welcome any and all feedback that you have.
* **You'll be interacting with a prototype.** A prototype is like a simulation of what the app might look like in the future. It's a guess we have before we build anything, which is why we're talking with Veterans like you to get your thoughts so we can improve it. Since it’s a prototype some areas will be clickable, and some will not. I'll guide you if you get stuck in any of those areas.
* **Please know you are in the driver’s seat.** Since we will be talking about managing medications, you don’t need to provide the names of actual medications if you don’t want to. Feel free to share the information you’re comfortable with.
* **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**

Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

* If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

_Start recording._

I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Section 1: Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Before we look at the prototype, I’d like to start with a few warm-up questions:
* Over the last month, how have you used VA.gov, MyHealthEVet or any other VA apps to manage your healthcare or benefits with the VA? 
    * If yes: Which of these sites or apps did you go to most frequently? Why?
    * If no: Move to next question
* Do you have the VA Health and Benefits mobile app?
    * If yes: 
        * When did you first start using it?
        * What are the main reasons you use it?
        * How frequently do you go into the app? Daily? Weekly? Monthly?
        * What do you like best? What do you wish you could change?
    * If no; Move to next question
* Do you currently use any digital services such as VA.gov, MHV, or the Rx refill app to view and manage your prescriptions?
    * If yes: What is your experience like using these tools?
    * If no: How do you currently view and manage your prescriptions?

Thank you for sharing that. Now, we're going to take a look at a few things in the simulation, or prototype that we're working on for managing prescriptions in the VA mobile app. Before we get to that though, are you comfortable with sharing your screen with us today?  Sharing your screen helps us see how you interact with the prototype and gives us a better sense of what you’re looking at.  

* If yes: Great, take some time now to mute your notifications and close out any apps or tabs that have sensitive information. Feel free to take your time, and let me know when you’re ready to share your screen. 
* If no: No problem, I can have you verbally walk us through what you're seeing and clicking as you interact with the prototype. 

Before I send you the link to the prototype in the chat, imagine that you are using the VA mobile app and you're already logged in. What you’ll be seeing is all of your prescriptions. Now, I'm going to send you the link in the chat, go ahead and open it up.

## Section 2: "All" Tab - 5 minutes 

Before we select anything or navigate anywhere else I’d like to pause on this screen and have you look around and speak to what you’re seeing and thinking. Feel free to scroll up and down, but don’t click on anything just yet. As you go, please talk out loud. It's really helpful to hear your thoughts on how things are coming across to you, or if things don't make sense.

### Task

* What do you think you’d be able to do here?
* What do you think about the information you’re seeing?

### Things to watch for

* What do they think they’d be able to do?


## Section 3: Refill Modal - 10 minutes

### Task

* Imagine a scenario where you need to refill a prescription for Advil, how would you go about doing that? Remember to speak out loud as you go through the process.  
    * _If they have issues finding the refill button, pivot to questioning about what would make it easier and how they would expect to refill_
* Where do you expect to find the prescription you just requested a refill of?

### Things to watch for

* Are Veterans successfully able to open the refill modal and refill a prescription? How do they go about doing that? 
* Where do they expect to find requested refills? Why there?
* Are there any pain points?


## Section 4: "Processing" Tab - 10 minutes

### Task

* If you wanted to see prescriptions that you’ve requested a refill for, how would you go about doing that?
* What kind of prescriptions would you expect to find in this list or tab?

### Things to watch for

* Do Veterans understand that the processing tab contains their submitted and in process prescriptions?


## Section 5: "Shipped Tab" - 10 minutes

### Task

* If you wanted to see tracked prescriptions (prescriptions that are on the way to you), how would you go about doing that?
* If you wanted to view tracking details for your Motrin prescription, how would you go about doing that?
* If this list containes refills that are ready for shipping, refills that have shipped, and refills that were recently delivered to you what would you call it?

### Things to watch for

* Do Veterans understand that the shipped tab contains their tracked prescriptions?
* Are Veterans successfully able to navigate to the tracking details modal? What are they selecting to get there?


## Section 6: Landing Screen Discovery - 10 minutes (Optional)

_Go through this section if there is extra time at the end_

### Task

* When you think about all the things you need to do right now to manage your prescriptions, what would you say are the top 3-4 items you need to do to stay on top of it? Were any of those things missing from what you saw today?
* Do you have prescriptions you manage that aren't through the VA? How do you manage these? 
* How do you get your prescriptions renewed?

### Things to watch for

* What do users find valuable for a pharmacy landing page?


## Post-Task Interview - 2 minutes

* What did you find difficult about the things we asked you to help us test today? Why?
* What did you find useful about the things we asked you to help us test today? Why?
* Do you have any questions for me?
