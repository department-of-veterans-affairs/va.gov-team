# Content decision log - Personalization
One of the goals of personalization is to surface a Veteran's most important VA interactions on the Home screen. In the absence of robust notifications, this reduces the need for Veterans to tap further down into the mobile app for valuable information, such as if they have prescriptions ready to refill.

It's important to remember that the mobile app is an authenticated experience and shows data that's only relevant to the Veteran. For example, content explaining that data from My VA Health portal isn't integrated into the app is only shown to Veterans associated with Cerner/Oracle facilities (i.e., content is dynamic).

Below is a log of decisions made related to content for this project.

| Content need                 | Decision         | Explanation        | Decision made by | Date                 |
| :-------------              | :-------------              |:-------------         |:-------------         |:-------------|
| Copy when we get an error for 1 or more (but not all) pieces of data in the About you section | We can't show all your information right now. Check back later. | Previously, we had decided that for edge cases 8a, 8b, and 9c in the [MVP logic Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/m/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/1704381519703/cd6d78c5824a5fb0cc8b26597f0ad271072df8f2?sender=39de3708-9fee-4433-b85d-efc7a901add6), we would not show parts of the About you section if we received errors such as timeout or maintenance windows. But after releasing the new home screen, we saw some confusion from a Veteran on Reddit wondering why they could see their payment but not their rating. We decided to put error messaging. We chose to reuse some of the same wording we use for other similar errors in the Activity section and included some language to "check back later" to indicate that this information should (and usually is) there. | Misty Milliron-Grant | 8/9/2024 | 
| Copy for when no data is shown in About you section | We can't show your information right now. | This is a very rare edge case in which, for some reason, there's no military information for the user (which means nothing shows up in this section). Without some in-depth digging into the BE, we can't be sure what type of user this would actually be. For this reason, I'm treating this copy more like an error state rather than a null state. | Misty Milliron-Grant | 2/8/2024 |
| Copy on Health category screen for when Veteran doesn't have VA health care | Apply for VA health care on VA.gov | My VA uses wording right now to the effect of "You have no health care information to show. Visit VA.gov to apply for VA Health care." But I don't believe this is accurate. Since we're using the announcements-type component, I'd like to keep this copy to one phrase/sentence instead of two. I'm assumming that saying "You're not enrolled..." is just too obvious. Instead, I'd like to keep this as more of a CTA than an error-type message. Something to explore later is whether it'd be better to direct users to the apply page on VA.gov or the the eligibility page. | Misty Milliron-Grant | 2/15/2024 | 
| Loading state for category screens | Loading [health/benefits] activity... | We want to set the expectation that what is actually being loaded is the "activity" -- the count of their active items -- on the category screen. This is why we chose not to use "Loading your health information..." or similar wording. | Misty Milliron-Grant | 2/5/2024 |
| Empty state copy for Activity section: [Case 2b in Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/m/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/1704381519703/cd6d78c5824a5fb0cc8b26597f0ad271072df8f2?sender=u85a35f55e50d7c375c782462) | There's no activity to show. | We'll just keep this simple. | Misty Milliron-Grant | 2/5/2024 |
| Copy for monthly payment on Home screen | Monthly compensation payment | There was a concern that just saying "Monthly payment" would be too general since Veterans can receive various types of payments from VA. I searched around for how this specific payment is usually labeled. It appears in several different ways. "Compensation & Pension" and "Award" were 2 I found. I chose to add the word "compensation" with the hopes that since this data will always be coupled with the disability rating, the Veteran would understand that this is the payment associated with their disability rating. Post-MVP, we should test this with Veterans and adjust copy as needed. | Misty Milliron-Grant | 1/31/2024 |
| Copy for cases [7a/b, 8a/b & 9a/b/c on Home screen](https://app.mural.co/t/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/m/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/1704381519703/cd6d78c5824a5fb0cc8b26597f0ad271072df8f2?wid=7-1704478852787) | We can’t show all activity right now. Check back later. | This encompasses all error cases on Home screen: 7a/b (aggregate API failures), 8a (API timeout), 8b (API failure), 9a and 9b (availability framework), and 9c (maintenance window).</br> <br>The appearance logic for each of these cases is that if a feature module on Home is affected by one of these issues, we won’t show the module. We’ll only show modules with 100% accurate counts or we won’t show the module at all.</br> <br>Because we won’t show an inaccurate module on Home for these cases, to get to that feature, a user _**must**_ navigate to that feature via a category screen. Therefore, I propose keeping the error messaging in the Activity section for these cases a bit more general and let the user learn more about why there is an error at the category and feature level. This ensures we’re telling the user just enough of what they need to know in the moment (on the Home screen). We also don't want to discourage users from continuing to explore the app or tap into features. Finally, this approach reduces the complexity of our error handling.</br> <br>Here is a breakdown of why I chose the wording I chose: <br>_**We can’t show**_ (Places the problem with VA, not the Veteran, and signals that the problem is a data retrieval problem.) </br>_**all activity**_ (Informs the users there could be more activity) <br>_**right now**_ (We’ll eventually be able to show you all activity). <br>_**Check back later**_ (We don’t expect this to last forever). | Misty Milliron-Grant | 1/30/2024 |
| Copy for cases [8a/b on Category screens](https://app.mural.co/t/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/m/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/1704381519703/cd6d78c5824a5fb0cc8b26597f0ad271072df8f2?wid=52-1705940595181) | We can't get some of your information right now. [Health/Benefits] activity may not be accurate. Check back later. | If a feature API fails or times out, we can’t know an accurate count of active items for that feature. But unlike 8a/b on the Home screen, on the Category screens, _we will still show the feature entry module, just with no count_. No count signals to the user no active items for that feature. But in this case, a module with no count could mean the Veteran has no active items in that feature OR that we just can’t show the active item count. Therefore, we want to communicate to the user that it could be inaccurate at the moment.</br> <br>The copy follows a 3-sentence model that is repeated on other Category screens: (1) what happened, (2) how it affects information on the category screen, and (3) a simple solution.</br> <br>For cases 8a and 8b, I reviewed a lot of current API error messages on both VA.gov and VAHB mobile app. Unfortunately, most of the current messages aren’t helpful or accurate in their wording.</br> <br>Here is a breakdown of why I chose the wording I chose: <br>_**We can’t get**_ (Places the problem with VA, not the Veteran, and signals that the problem is a data retrieval problem.) <br>_**some of your information**_ (Brevity over clarity in this moment. We can let the feature level be more specific about what information we can’t get. We also don’t want to discourage users from tapping on the feature entry module.) <br>_**right now**_ (we don’t expect this to be forever).<br>_**[Health/Benefits]**_ (specific to the category screen. We won’t call out individual features as there could be multiple) <br>_**activity**_ (Helps users continue to learn what we mean by “activity,” those counts of active things) <br>_**may not be accurate**_ (We can’t be sure about what we’re showing but we have to show something).<br>_**Check back later**_ (We don’t expect this to last forever). | Misty Milliron-Grant | 1/30/2024 | 
| Copy for cases [9a/b on Category screens](https://app.mural.co/t/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/m/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/1704381519703/cd6d78c5824a5fb0cc8b26597f0ad271072df8f2?wid=67-1705940595181) | We're fixing a problem. [Health/Benefits] activity may not be accurate. Check back later. | Cases 9a and 9b are rare and appear when we're executing our Availability Framework. In short, we use this framework to restrict access to features or alert users when we find critical errors. Like cases 8a/b, when our Availability Framework affects a feature, we will still show the feature entry module, just with no count. Again, we want to communicate to the user that information on this screen could be inaccurate at the moment.</br> <br>The language follows the same 3-sentence model, with the first sentence changed for the context of 9a and 9b. In the content templates for our Availability Framework, when executed, we use the wording of “We’re fixing a problem.” | Misty Milliron-Grant | 1/30/2024 | 
| Copy for case [9c on Category screens](https://app.mural.co/t/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/m/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/1704381519703/cd6d78c5824a5fb0cc8b26597f0ad271072df8f2?wid=57-1705940595181) | We’re working on the mobile app. [Health/Benefits] activity may not be accurate. Check back later. | Case 9c is when a downtime/maintenance window is in effect for a feature. Like cases 8a/b and 9a/b, we will still show the feature entry module, just with no count. Again, we want to communicate to the user that information on this screen could be inaccurate at the moment.</br> <br>The language follows the same 3-sentence model, with the first sentence changed for the context of 9c. This "We're working on..." is the same language used on VA.gov and the mobile app for maintenance messaging. | Misty Milliron-Grant | 1/30/2024 | 
| Copy for case [7a on Category screen](https://app.mural.co/t/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/m/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/1704381519703/cd6d78c5824a5fb0cc8b26597f0ad271072df8f2?wid=53-1705940595181) | We can't get some of your information right now. [Appointments/Claims] activity may not be accurate. Check back later. | This error case is when the Claims and/or Appointments aggregate API temporarily fails on the Category screen.</br> <br>On the Category screens for Health and Benefits, if one of the aggregate API fails for Appointments or Claims but another one succeeds (and has a count of >0), we may be showing an inaccurate count of active items. We’ll reuse the wording from 7a on the Home screen. But the dynamic copy will be specific to the feature in the category (i.e., Appointments activity may not be accurate only applies on the Health screen, not the Benefits screen).</br> <br>Note: If there are multiple API errors occurring (i.e., we’re getting a 7a error and an 8a error), we’ll defer to the message that is more general. | Misty Milliron-Grant | 1/30/2024 | 
| Copy for case [7b on Category screen](https://app.mural.co/t/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/m/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/1704381519703/cd6d78c5824a5fb0cc8b26597f0ad271072df8f2?wid=25-1704381571432) | We can't get some of your information. Claims activity may not be accurate. | This error case is when the Claims aggregate API permanently fails. This is a very rare case. And we can’t always know why the API will fail permanently. (An example of one use case for this is when a user’s SSN doesn’t match VA’s records.) Since we can’t be sure, we’ll need to be a bit more general and let the feature-level error better explain the issue. And since this is a permanent failure, we removed the “check back later.” | Misty Milliron-Grant | 1/30/2024 | 
| Greeting/Veteran's name | Remove greeting & preferred name from Home screen | We received feedback from Ryan Thurlwell and Rachel Han to remove the greeting from the Home screen. Our team asked for clarification on why and stated our reasons for keeping in [this DSVA Slack thread](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C018V2JCWRJ/p1706563024738809?thread_ts=1705941770.920469&cid=C018V2JCWRJ).</br> <br>Note on previous decisions that are now n/a: Back in December, we had decided on "Welcome, [preferred name]/Welcome back, [preferred name]". We had done some exploration of greeting options, trying to balance a personal experience with VA's voice and tone. After discussing with Danielle, we agreed to Welcome for first sign in and Welcome back for all subsequent sign ins. We'd heard in past research sessions that a greeting and a Veteran seeing their name on the screen helps create that personalized, "this is mine!" experience. The best data field for the greeting is the preferred name. But if the Veteran has no preferred name on file, we can default to their legal first name. In the rare case of no legal first name (which apparently does happen), we omit the name field from the greeting.| Mobile App stakeholders | 1/30/2024 | 
| Copy to explain to Cerner users that Activity section doesn't include counts of active items associated with My VA Health portal: [Case 5a/5b in Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/m/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/1704381519703/cd6d78c5824a5fb0cc8b26597f0ad271072df8f2?sender=u85a35f55e50d7c375c782462) | Information from My VA Health portal not included. | This copy will be included at the bottom of the Activity section and is only shown to Cerner users. We kept the copy as concise and clear as possible. With the eventual integration of Cerner data, this copy may not be needed eventually. | Misty Milliron-Grant | 1/22/2024 | 
| Initial load copy for Activity section: [Case 1 in Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/m/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/1704381519703/cd6d78c5824a5fb0cc8b26597f0ad271072df8f2?sender=u85a35f55e50d7c375c782462) | Loading mobile app activity... | We chose to add modifying words to activity (i.e., "mobile app") to support the idea that what is being loaded are "things that are happening in the mobile app." We wanted to stay away from the phrase "your activity." Your activity implies that a user is doing something, rather than things that are going on in the app. We believe users will quickly learn what to expect in the Activity section. But a more clear intial loading state only helps to build that mental model for the user. We also explored several different present participles (i.e., checking, looking, etc.). But the word "loading" is already well-understood by users, thereby reducing cognitive load for what to expect. | Misty Milliron-Grant | 01/22/2024 | 
| Descriptive word(s) for prescriptions counter | # ready to refill | We decided the "active" items to count for Prescriptions will be the number of prescriptions that a Veteran can refill in the mobile app. We will use content that is similar to web, with the simplified "ready" instead of "available". | Misty Milliron-Grant (with help from Laura Willwerth) | 01/17/2024 | 
| Descriptive word(s) for appointments counter | # in the next 7 days | We originally started with "Upcoming." But because our full list of appointments in the feature is labeled "Upcoming," we needed to differentiate the full upcoming appointment list and the small group of appointments we're counting on the Home screen. Using "this week" was suggested. But we then learned that we can't make a determination when a "new week" begins. And some Veterans may have different mental models of what is considered "this week" (Is it Mon-Sun?, Sun-Sat?). From a logic perspective, we're going to count appointments by what is confirmed upcoming in the next 7 days. | Misty Milliron-Grant and Danielle Thierry | 01/17/2024 | 
| Header copy for section that shows Veterans branch of service, disability rating, and/or monthly payment | About you | We explored a lot of different options. Some examples include About you, About you at VA, Veteran overview, Veteran snapshot, VA status preview, Profile preview. Unfortuately, no one label has seemed to fit 100%, especially if there is minimum data available (i.e., only branch of service is shown). Therefore, we agreed to move forward with a suggestion by Ryan Thurlwell: About you. Post-MVP, we plan to test this section with Veterans to get feedback on if they expect to see this type of infomration together or even on the Home screen and whether they'd label this section as something else. | Misty Milliron-Grant and Danielle Thierry | 01/17/2024 | 
| Header for "active" items | Activity | We've decided on Activity for header that includes the count of active items on the Home screen. We explore a lot of other ideas (Highlights, Preview, Latest activity, Overview, and combination of those and others). Activity conveys that things are happening in the app that the Veteran should/could pay attention to. We chose to leave out modifying words, like "Latest" since we're combining things that are time-sensitive- ish (health stuff) with a thing that's just going to hang out (claims). And this will hopefully set the expectation that some things may not change frequently.We also decided against words like preview and overview and summary. In the end, they weren't adding anything to convey what was happening. Finally, Activity makes writing copy for empty/error states a bit easier. | Misty Milliron-Grant and Danielle Thierry | 01/10/2024 | 
| Keep or get rid of COVID-19 updates | Delete COVID-19 updates from new Personalized Home screen but keep on Health category screen | VA.gov has buried this COVID-19 updates page. I had to do a literal search to find the page. It's not highlighted on their Home or health-related screens.<br> <br>  Checked with Data Analyst for data-informed reason for removing. From Greta Optz: If utilization is the only factor for [removing from both screens], I don't think the data supports this. We've seen a lot of growth in utilization since March (June was down for everything which is why I'm discounting that change). On an average day in November, 16% of authenticated users (folks who got logged in) viewed the Covid-19 link. I also manually pulled the utilization by screen. At the beginning of the year, over 82% of views of the Covid-19 link came from the Health screen. However, that imbalance shifted starting in April and has been more evenly divided since then. I also checked for how many users are viewing from both origin places. Even if I subtract all the folks who viewed in both places from the Home viewers total, those who viewed from Home only would be 37% of the users who viewed it in November. That said, utilization doesn't have to be the only factor; I think this data doesn't conflict with the notion of removing it from Home screen but keeping it on Health. It would be great if we had a way to clue users who didn't know it was in both places that it still exists, but we might just have to hope they figure that out on their own. | Misty Milliron-Grant (with input from Holly Collier, Lauren Russell, Greta Optz) | 12/18/2023 | 
| Descriptive word for message count on Home screen | Unread | I explored both "new" and "unread". And confirmed that what is determining the message count is whether a Veteran has tapped into a message. This means an "older" message could still be unread. "Unread" could also help remind a Veteran who forgot to read an older message. Like, "Hey the Home screen is telling me a still have an unread message even though I've read the ones that showed up on top. Let me go check. [actually scrolls] Well, looky there! There's one I missed."<br> <br>  I chatted with Laura W. from CAIA about how the web Medications team is framing this. She thought either choice was fine and that it likely wouldn't trip users up if we used new or unread. But the Medications web tool is using unread.<br> <br>  Finally, since we're not using this space on the Home screen as a notifications area (and more of grouping of "active" items," I'd like to save the word "new" for when we. | Misty Milliron-Grant (with help from Laura Willwerth | 12/08/2023 | 
| Content to show in new Accouncements area on personalized Home screen | VAHB mobile app will mirror announcments/update on unauthenticated VA.gov home screen | We needed to determine not only what will go in our new Accouncements section for MVP but in the future as well. The MVP suggestion is to link to PACT Act info. But what do we show when that is no longer relevant? My recommendation is to follow the main announcement/updates component on the VA.gov landing screen.<br> <br> Per Danielle Thierry, that area has been an OPIA (Office of Public and Intergovernmental Affairs)-driven area. Its intention is to _highlight high-profile benefit and health-related updates for Veterans_. | Misty Milliron-Grant | 12/08/2023 | 
| Descriptive word for claims count on Home screen | Active | This is the current word used to descriptive claims and appeals that aren't closed (i.e., open) on both mobile app and web. | Misty Milliron-Grant | 12/07/2023 | 


Other content notes for Personalization

Post-MVP, we'd like to explicitly test if the Home screen sections are doing what we expect them to do for Veterans. If not, we should explore, either:
- Rethinking what the active thing is for claims so that it aligns better with the health-related things. As it stands now, the health stuff is more like a to-do-list vs the claims is more of a monitor-this-thing. If we change the active thing for claims to communicate the Veteran can do something, grouping them together works. (And we could even revisit the header copy to be even better.)
- Rethinking if we should combine all modules or if some modules need to be under a separate header. Our initial design made an assumption that the only way to split these modules was by health vs benefits. But are there other ways to categorize these modules that works better for Veterans? Perhaps by things a Veteran can do vs. things a Veteran is waiting for VA to do.
