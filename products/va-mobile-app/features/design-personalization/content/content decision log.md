| TBD | Confirm copy for monthly payment on Home screen | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| 01/24/2024 | Copy for API failures (all) for CATEGORY screens | Something went wrong on our end. [Health/Benefits/Payments] information may not be accurate. Check back later. | TBD | Misty Milliron-Grant |
| 01/24/2024 | Intial load copy for CATEGORY screens | Loading your [health/benefits/payments] information... | TBD  | Misty Milliron-Grant |
| 01/24/2024 | Copy for maintenance windows on CATEGORY screens | We're working on the mobile app. [Health/Benefits/Payments] information may not be accurate. Check back later. | We're using the same first and third sentence as the maintenance window on the Activity section of the Home screen. For the second sentence though, we added the modifying [category] word. We chose to move away from the word "activity" and use "information" as a user drills down into the feature to differentiate between....Note that Payments is n/a for MVP but would have eventually needed to be accounted for.  | Misty Milliron-Grant |
| 01/24/2024 | Copy for maintenance windows on HOME screen: [Case 9c in Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/m/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/1704381519703/cd6d78c5824a5fb0cc8b26597f0ad271072df8f2?sender=u85a35f55e50d7c375c782462) | We're working on the mobile app. Activity may not be accurate. Check back later. | For the first sentence, we're using similar language to what web/mobile app already use for maintenance windows. We don't want to tell users something is wrong or broken. Therefore, we didn't use language like "We're fixing..." For the second sentence, we're reusing the same wording in other error/edge cases. This creates consistency in assuring the user that data may be inaccurate and that it's not their fault. For the third sentence, reusing wording advising user to check back (instead of trying again). | Misty Milliron-Grant |
| 01/24/2024 | Copy for API timeout/errors on HOME: [Case 8a/8b in Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/m/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/1704381519703/cd6d78c5824a5fb0cc8b26597f0ad271072df8f2?sender=u85a35f55e50d7c375c782462) | Something went wrong on our end. Activity may not be accurate. Check back later. | The first sentence is standard wording used across web/mobile app for API errors and places the blame on VA, not the user. For the second sentence, we're reusing the same wording in other error/edge cases. This creates consistency in assuring the user that data may be inaccurate and that it's not their fault. For the third sentence, reusing wording advising user to check back (instead of trying again). | Misty Milliron-Grant |
| TBD | Copy for perm aggregate API error on HOME: [Case 7b in Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/m/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/1704381519703/cd6d78c5824a5fb0cc8b26597f0ad271072df8f2?sender=u85a35f55e50d7c375c782462) | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| 01/24/2024 | Copy for temp aggregate API error on HOME: [Case 7a in Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/m/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/1704381519703/cd6d78c5824a5fb0cc8b26597f0ad271072df8f2?sender=u85a35f55e50d7c375c782462) | Something went wrong on our end. Activity may not be accurate. Check back later. | This is a complex case. In short, Claims and Appointments have feeder APIs. If one feeder API call fails but another succeeds, we may not be displaying feature module when we should be/the count in module may be wrong. This is a temporary API failure (it should/could resolve). We considered getting granular with the wording to explain to the user that something with Appointments went wrong. Or something with Claims went wrong. Or something with both Appointments AND Claims went wrong. At that point though, we decided getting that granular is unnecessary. We also don't get that granular with other API failures. Therefore, we decided to reuse the same message as the other API error states (8a and 8b in Mural). This still communicates that there's an issue. The issue is VA's fault, not the user's. And that because of this issue, the data in the Activity section may not be correct. | Misty Milliron-Grant |
| TBD | Empty state copy for Activity section: [Case 2b in Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/m/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/1704381519703/cd6d78c5824a5fb0cc8b26597f0ad271072df8f2?sender=u85a35f55e50d7c375c782462) | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| 01/22/2024 | Copy for when Availability Framework is in effect on HOME: [Case 9a/9b in Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/m/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/1704381519703/cd6d78c5824a5fb0cc8b26597f0ad271072df8f2?sender=u85a35f55e50d7c375c782462) | Weâ€™re fixing a problem. Activity may not be accurate. Check back later. | This copy covers 2 Availability Framework use cases: (1) we're restricting access to a feature and (2) we're not restricting access but a feature may be broken. We'll show this copy to reassure the user that we know there's a problem, we're fixing that problem, and because of that problem, the information shown in the Activity section may not be correct. The first sentence is the same language we're using for copy in the Availbility Framework. For the second sentence, we chose to vary the sentence type/structure (not starting the sentence with another "We"). For the third sentence, we also chose "Check back later." instead of the usual "Try again later." since there's not much of a way for a user to "try again." "Check back" is more accurate of what a user can do. As a whole, this copy tries to balance brevity with clarity.  | Misty Milliron-Grant  
| 01/22/2024 | Copy to explain to Cerner users that Activity section doesn't include counts of active items associated with My VA Health portal: [Case 5a/5b in Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/m/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/1704381519703/cd6d78c5824a5fb0cc8b26597f0ad271072df8f2?sender=u85a35f55e50d7c375c782462) | Information from My VA Health portal not included. | This copy will be included at the bottom of the Activity section and is only shown to Cerner users. We kept the copy as concise and clear as possible. With the eventual integration of Cerner data, this copy may not be needed eventually. | Misty Milliron-Grant
| 01/22/2024 | Initial load copy for Activity section: [Case 1 in Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/m/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/1704381519703/cd6d78c5824a5fb0cc8b26597f0ad271072df8f2?sender=u85a35f55e50d7c375c782462) | Loading mobile app activity... | We chose to add modifying words to activity (i.e., "mobile app") to support the idea that what is being loaded are "things that are happening in the mobile app." We wanted to stay away from the phrase "your activity." Your activity implies that a user is doing something, rather than things that are going on in the app. We believe users will quickly learn what to expect in the Activity section. But a more clear intial loading state only helps to build that mental model for the user. We also explored several different present participles (i.e., checking, looking, etc.). But the word "loading" is already well-understood by users, thereby reducing cognitive load for what to expect. | Misty Milliron-Grant
| 01/17/2024 | Descriptive word(s) for prescriptions counter | # ready to refill | We decided the "active" items to count for Prescriptions will be the number of prescriptions that a Veteran can refill in the mobile app. We will use content that is similar to web, with the simplified "ready" instead of "available". | Misty Milliron-Grant (with help from Laura Willwerth)
| 01/17/2024 | Descriptive word(s) for appointments counter | # in the next 7 days | We originally started with "Upcoming." But because our full list of appointments in the feature is labeled "Upcoming," we needed to differentiate the full upcoming appointment list and the small group of appointments we're counting on the Home screen. Using "this week" was suggested. But we then learned that we can't make a determination when a "new week" begins. And some Veterans may have different mental models of what is considered "this week" (Is it Mon-Sun?, Sun-Sat?). From a logic perspective, we're going to count appointments by what is confirmed upcoming in the next 7 days. | Misty Milliron-Grant and Danielle Thierry |
| 01/17/2024 | Header copy for section that shows Veterans branch of service, disability rating, and/or monthly payment | About you | We explored a lot of different options. Some examples include About you, About you at VA, Veteran overview, Veteran snapshot, VA status preview, Profile preview. Unfortuately, no one label has seemed to fit 100%, especially if there is minimum data available (i.e., only branch of service is shown). Therefore, we agreed to move forward with a suggestion by Ryan Thurlwell: About you. Post-MVP, we plan to test this section with Veterans to get feedback on if they expect to see this type of infomration together or even on the Home screen and whether they'd label this section as something else. | Misty Milliron-Grant and Danielle Thierry |
| 01/10/2024 | Header for "active" items | Activity | We've decided on Activity for header that includes the count of active items on the Home screen. We explore a lot of other ideas (Highlights, Preview, Latest activity, Overview, and combination of those and others). Activity conveys that things are happening in the app that the Veteran should/could pay attention to. We chose to leave out modifying words, like "Latest" since we're combining things that are time-sensitive- ish (health stuff) with a thing that's just going to hang out (claims). And this will hopefully set the expectation that some things may not change frequently.We also decided against words like preview and overview and summary. In the end, they weren't adding anything to convey what was happening. Finally, Activity makes writing copy for empty/error states a bit easier. | Misty Milliron-Grant and Danielle Thierry |
| 12/18/2023 | Keep or get rid of COVID-19 updates | Delete COVID-19 updates from new Personalized Home screen but keep on Health category screen | VA.gov has buried this COVID-19 updates page. I had to do a literal search to find the page. It's not highlighted on their Home or health-related screens.<br> <br>  Checked with Data Analyst for data-informed reason for removing. From Greta Optz: If utilization is the only factor for [removing from both screens], I don't think the data supports this. We've seen a lot of growth in utilization since March (June was down for everything which is why I'm discounting that change). On an average day in November, 16% of authenticated users (folks who got logged in) viewed the Covid-19 link. I also manually pulled the utilization by screen. At the beginning of the year, over 82% of views of the Covid-19 link came from the Health screen. However, that imbalance shifted starting in April and has been more evenly divided since then. I also checked for how many users are viewing from both origin places. Even if I subtract all the folks who viewed in both places from the Home viewers total, those who viewed from Home only would be 37% of the users who viewed it in November. That said, utilization doesn't have to be the only factor; I think this data doesn't conflict with the notion of removing it from Home screen but keeping it on Health. It would be great if we had a way to clue users who didn't know it was in both places that it still exists, but we might just have to hope they figure that out on their own. | Misty Milliron-Grant (with input from Holly Collier, Lauren Russell, Greta Optz)
| 12/08/2023 | Descriptive word for message count on Home screen | Unread | I explored both "new" and "unread". And confirmed that what is determining the message count is whether a Veteran has tapped into a message. This means an "older" message could still be unread. "Unread" could also help remind a Veteran who forgot to read an older message. Like, "Hey the Home screen is telling me a still have an unread message even though I've read the ones that showed up on top. Let me go check. [actually scrolls] Well, looky there! There's one I missed."<br> <br>  I chatted with Laura W. from CAIA about how the web Medications team is framing this. She thought either choice was fine and that it likely wouldn't trip users up if we used new or unread. But the Medications web tool is using unread.<br> <br>  Finally, since we're not using this space on the Home screen as a notifications area (and more of grouping of "active" items," I'd like to save the word "new" for when we. | Misty Milliron-Grant (with help from Laura Willwerth |
| 12/08/2023 | Content to show in new Accouncements area on personalized Home screen | VAHB mobile app will mirror announcments/update on unauthenticated VA.gov home screen | We needed to determine not only what will go in our new Accouncements section for MVP but in the future as well. The MVP suggestion is to link to PACT Act info. But what do we show when that is no longer relevant? My recommendation is to follow the main announcement/updates component on the VA.gov landing screen.<br> <br> Per Danielle Thierry, that area has been an OPIA (Office of Public and Intergovernmental Affairs)-driven area. Its intention is to _highlight high-profile benefit and health-related updates for Veterans_. | Misty Milliron-Grant | 
| 12/07/2023 | Descriptive word for claims count on Home screen | Active | This is the current word used to descriptive claims and appeals that aren't closed (i.e., open) on both mobile app and web. | Misty Milliron-Grant | 
| 12/06/2023 | Logic for Veteran name in greeting | Use preferred name (PN) when we have it.<br> <br> Use legal first name if PN is not available.<br> <br> If no PN or legal first name, omit name and just show "Welcome" | We've heard in past research sessions that a greeting and a Veteran seeing their name on the screen helps create that personalized, "this is mine!" experience.<br> <br> The best data field for the greeting is the preferred name. But if the Veteran has no preferred name on file, we can default to their legal first name. In the rarae case of no legal first name (which apparently does happen), we omit the name field from the greeting. | Misty Milliron-Grant | 
| 12/06/2023 | Greeting on Home screen | Welcome, [preferred name] (on first sign in)<br> <br> Welcome back, [preferred name] (on subsequent sign ins) | We did some exploration of greeting options, trying to balance a personal experience with VA's voice and tone. After discussing with Danielle, we agreed to Welcome for first sign in and Welcome back for all subsequent sign ins. | Misty Milliron-Grant (with help from Danielle Thierry)


Other content notes for Personalization

Post-MVP, we'd like to explicitly test if the Home screen sections are doing what we expect them to do for Veterans. If not, we should explore, either:
- Rethinking what the active thing is for claims so that it aligns better with the health-related things. As it stands now, the health stuff is more like a to-do-list vs the claims is more of a monitor-this-thing. If we change the active thing for claims to communicate the Veteran can do something, grouping them together works. (And we could even revisit the header copy to be even better.)
- Rethinking if we should combine all modules or if some modules need to be under a separate header. Our initial design made an assumption that the only way to split these modules was by health vs benefits. But are there other ways to categorize these modules that works better for Veterans? Perhaps by things a Veteran can do vs. things a Veteran is waiting for VA to do.
