# VA Mobile App - Personalized Home Screen: QA Summary of Findings 
Draft as of June 27, 2024
Expected completion date of July 2, 2024

## Project Details
- **Epic Ticket:**
  - [Zenhub/internal link: 3542](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/va-mobile-60f1a34998bc75000f2a489f/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app/3542)
  - [Public/github link: 3542](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app/issues/3542) (github will be missing a lot of the epic functionality).
- **QA Representative:** Therese
- **Testing Narrative:**
  - QA work on home screen personalization spanned ~14 sprints, with 71 tickets requiring QA work of roughly ~132 story points. (Total pointing/estimates are a little fuzzy, as both the QA and FE teams changed how we handle estimates midway through the project; the FE team mostly dropping them, and the QA team adding them more formally. Overall takeaway here is that HSP was a LARGE project.)

- **Bugs found:**
     - Bugs found were primarily documented as comments on original implementation tickets (example). Documenting as comments on implementation tickets and keeping those tickets in PR until bugs are resolved cuts down on documentation overhead needed to fix problems.
- **Bugs resolved:**
- **Bugs being released into production:**
- **Testing limitations:**
- **Other testing notes:**
  - UAT completed by other roles (see [UAT documentation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/va-mobile-app/features/design-personalization/uat))
   - Work on the [React Query migration (zenhub epic link)](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/va-mobile-60f1a34998bc75000f2a489f/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app/6729) occuring in develop (before, during & after home screen personalization work) impacted the implementation and testing of this feature
