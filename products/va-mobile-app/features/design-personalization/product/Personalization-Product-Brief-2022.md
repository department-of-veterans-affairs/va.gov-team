# VA Mobile App Personalization 2022 Product Brief

June 2022

### Problem Statement

Veterans are often in a vulnerable state when engaging with VA; healthcare and financial support are sensitive and vulnerable topics that have a real daily impact. However, there are unique challenges at VA that isolate and confuse Veterans, rather than support them in their journey.  



* **Veterans are left to connect the dots between a fragmented system on their own**- Veterans often have to retell their story
* **Veterans feel ‘in the dark’ during their benefits journey**- they don’t know what the VA is doing and what’s needed from them.  
* **Veterans feel discouraged to apply, manage and maximize their benefits-** the VA ecosystem is very confusing and it’s difficult to find the right information. 
* **For many, interacting with the VA benefits system involves dealing with uncomfortable feelings**- vulnerability goes against military conditioning. 

We know that Veterans value **staying informed**, feeling a **sense of control,** and **connecting with others** for guidance. A personalized VA flagship app can leverage what VA knows about Veterans to be a proactive dot connector, help Veterans feel more supported, and facilitate a deeper connection with VA. 


### Assumptions and Level of Confidence



* Personalized content is valuable to Veterans and will lead to higher app adoption
* Veterans will value personalized content so highly that they keep returning to the app 
* Veterans want to see information related to them and desire a sense that ‘the app knows me’
* We are unsure about the type and volume of information Veterans want to see- how much is too much information/not enough? 
* We have assumptions about how Veterans want to feel when they see personalized content and what makes them feel supported 
* The app is the proper channel to connect them with VA personnel for help


### Business Goals

### Why should this feature be on the app?



* Personalization represents the next iteration of the app that is more proactive and highlights information that is timely and relevant 
* With health & benefits combined into one app, it is uniquely positioned to serve as a stepping stone to other VA services and benefits that Veterans may be eligible for 
* A mobile app is an inherently more intimate experience- it lives on the Veteran’s phone that is often carried around with them all day. VA can leverage this opportunity to create a warmer and more supportive connection with Veterans by doing the hard work for them.


### Feature Set

A personalized VA mobile app will give Veterans the ability to manage their current actions (and discover their possible future interactions) across the VA. It should:



* Offer a **[high-level view of a Veterans’ current interactions with the VA (across multiple channels)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md#participants-want-a-page-that-is-focused-on-current-information-specific-to-them-rather-than-generalized-information-for-all-veterans)**
* **Anticipate Veterans’ needs** & do the hard work for them by [surfacing content and/or proactively notifying them about tasks that are timely & relevant to their individual context](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/discovery-summary.md#veterans-want-new-information-to-be-clear-to-them-when-they-log-in-and-expect-to-receive-new-information-through-multiple-channels)
* [Scale to support different phases of the Veteran lifecycle ](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/discovery-summary.md#the-logged-in-homepage-needs-to-scale-to-support-every-phase-of-the-veteran-lifecycle)
* Provide **easy** **access to the things they use the most**:[ records and documents](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md#easy-access-to-documents-from-the-homepage-was-important-for-participants), [frequently accessed features](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md#participants-are-primarily-interested-in-completing-healthcare-and-disability-related-tasks-such-as-messaging-ordering-medication-and-checking-claim-status)
* Be **accessible** **to Veterans of all abilities** ([Accessibility is core to all design decisions](https://design.va.gov/foundation/principles#usable-by-everyone)). 
* **[Allow users to discover VA benefits that they might not yet be using. ](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/discovery-summary.md#the-logged-in-homepage-needs-to-scale-to-support-every-phase-of-the-veteran-lifecycle)**
* **Allow users to connect with others who know their case** (inside & outside the VA) **when they need support** & guidance navigating their benefits. [(VA Benefit planning, applications, and claims research, pp 37, 53, 74, 97 - Frog, March 2016)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/previous-research-review.md#:~:text=Benefit%20planning%2C%20applications%2C%20and%20claims%20research%20conducted%20by%20Frog%20in%202016)

We will test which pieces of information are valuable to Veterans in user research. From there, we can create what our end vision state looks like, and then work backward to deliver iteratively. 


### Risks

Our biggest products risks include: 



* We’re not sure if people will actually find value in a personalized experience, we’re not sure what people mean by “a unified view” of all their VA interactions (and how much information is too much).  
* There is significant app architecture required as part of this work. It will be a complete overhaul of how the app operates today and signifies the second iteration of the app beyond an MVP. 
* Measuring success may be tricky. 
* The gap between web and mobile widens to the point that it’s confusing for Veterans who engage with both. 
* We may not have the staffing to maintain the high-level system of personalization, and the home screen becomes overgrown & a dumping ground over time without proper governance.

We will mitigate risk by: 



* Conducting user research to understand what is valuable to Veterans & whether our concepts are useful to Veterans. 
* Setting up ways to measure our success as best we can: define quantitative & qualitative metrics (including longitudinal studies).
* Collaborating with our partners at MHV, VA.gov & others to help ensure a cohesive experience across digital touchpoints.
* Create and document a framework and workflow for integrating new personalized content. Socialize it with feature teams. Add personalization conversation to feature kickoffs.
