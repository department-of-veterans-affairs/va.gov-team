# VA Mobile App - Personalized Home Screen - Product Brief 

August 2023

This work is part of the [VA Mobile App - Personalization project](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/va-mobile-app/features/design-personalization).


## Problem Statement

### Current Experience

The **VA Flagship mobile app** was [designed to help Veterans who are actively engaged with VA health and benefits services to keep track of their tasks and interactions across VA](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/product/Product-Outline.md#desired-user-outcomes). We have observed that research participants report that **they download the app to see if it can help them (but then don’t use it regularly and/or don't have time to investigate what the app can do for them)** and metrics indicate that **users who initially download the app do not actively use the app over time**. As a result, the VA mobile app may not be successfully **providing Veterans with a way to keep track of their activities across VA in a way that’s worth returning to**. 

Up to this point, the app has used a one-size-fits-all approach to the home screen that limits its perceived value to Veterans. In particular:



* Veterans don’t have a way to get a **quick overview of what VA is doing for them now or that something is needed from them** in order to keep things moving.
* Veteran **expectations and understanding** of what they think they can do in the mobile app are **limited and often inaccurate** (they want something to help them, and to know if the app is that thing).
* As the app adds more functionality or a Veteran gets more benefits from VA, Veterans have to **do more work to complete tasks** and **find information related to them.** 

We believe that these problems are making it more difficult for Veterans to realize how the app can help them which is resulting in **decreased user retention.**

### Desired Outcome - Hypothesis

We believe that **bringing personalized content to the VA mobile app’s home screen to new and current app users** will **help users to keep up with and manage their current interactions across VA** and **find value in the app that they aren’t discovering now**.

We will know we’re **right** when we see:



* An increase in **user comprehension of the app’s feature set.**
* An increase in **perceived current and future user value of the VA mobile app.**
* An increase in **user retention.**


## Business Goals

A more personalized VA Flagship mobile app drives forward the Flagship vision, its 2023 objectives, and directly funnels up to the OCTO goal of providing a personalized experience. 



* [**Flagship Mobile App Strategy**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1j0rO2HvDwHDTzunG3judC1HXOiWfGNTXVciLAkurpRw/edit#slide=id.g1e78b87c057_0_159)
    * **Vision:** "Each Veteran is connected to the VA services that matter most to them, regardless of device, and without understanding the VA org chart.”
    * **Objective 1:** Veterans will use authenticated services that are highly personalized and valuable.
    * **Objective 3:** Increase active user base.
* [**OCTO-DE Goals**](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme)
    * Goal 6: Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features.


### Roadmap

#### V1

The first version of Personalization will be a personalized home screen that offers  Veterans a snapshot of high-level details specific to them (ex. Disability rating) and an **[ overview of a Veteran’s current interactions with the VA (across multiple channels).](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md#participants-want-a-page-that-is-focused-on-current-information-specific-to-them-rather-than-generalized-information-for-all-veterans)** The personalized home screen would:



* Give Veterans a high-level snapshot of their status within VA (“digital self”).
* Provide a persistent overview of their current interactions across VA in the app.
* Make it clear when a feature needs their attention.
* Demonstrate the value of the VA mobile app to Veterans without requiring them to dig into each individual feature.

#### V2 & Beyond

Subsequent Personalization iterations will _**not**_ be limited to the home screen and could include:



* **Push notifications** that [surface content and/or proactively notify them about tasks that are timely & relevant to their individual context](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/discovery-summary.md#veterans-want-new-information-to-be-clear-to-them-when-they-log-in-and-expect-to-receive-new-information-through-multiple-channels)
* **Personalized content on the home screen contains richer data and interactions** than v1 (example: embedding actions like “Pay my bill”).
* **Personalized onboarding** to instantly guide new users to the features most relevant to them
* [Ways to help Veterans **discover VA benefits** that they aren’t using yet](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/discovery-summary.md#the-logged-in-homepage-needs-to-scale-to-support-every-phase-of-the-veteran-lifecycle)
* **Allow users to connect with others who know their case** (inside & outside the VA)when they need **support & guidance navigating their benefits.** [(VA Benefit planning, applications, and claims research, pp 37, 53, 74, 97 - Frog, March 2016)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/previous-research-review.md#:~:text=Benefit%20planning%2C%20applications%2C%20and%20claims%20research%20conducted%20by%20Frog%20in%202016)
* [**Frequently accessed** features](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md#participants-are-primarily-interested-in-completing-healthcare-and-disability-related-tasks-such-as-messaging-ordering-medication-and-checking-claim-status)  that provide easy access to the things they use the most:[(ex: VA records and documents)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md#easy-access-to-documents-from-the-homepage-was-important-for-participants)
* **[Transition support for different phases of the Veteran lifecycle](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/discovery-summary.md#the-logged-in-homepage-needs-to-scale-to-support-every-phase-of-the-veteran-lifecycle)**


## Measuring success

### Metrics

Measures of success are defined by an outcome with associated direct & proxy measurements. Additional details on how measures of success were determined are located in the [Data Project Plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/features/design-personalization/data/data_project_plan.md)



1. Veteran **comprehension** of what the app can do 1) in general and 2) for them in their current circumstances.
    * Direct: Participants in UX Research demonstrate an accurate understanding of what the app can do for them— in general and in their current circumstances
    * Proxy: App store reviews, Reddit posts:
        * Track prevalence of reviews including a misunderstanding of the app’s current functions written by users on versions featuring a personalized home screen. 
2. Veteran **satisfaction** with the amount (time & tasks) they are completing in the app.
    * Direct: Participants in UX Research (or in-app surveys) report they are satisfied with the amount of time they spend in the app. 
    * Proxy: App store reviews,  App store ratings, Reddit posts:
        * Reviewers on versions containing the personalized home screen express satisfaction at a higher rate than reviewers on versions without it
        * App store ratings for app versions containing personalized home screens are on average higher than versions without it.
        * Reddit posts describing satisfaction trends with the adoption of app versions that include the personalized home screen.
3. Veterans’ **perceived current and future value** of the app. 
    * Direct: Participants in UX research (or in-app surveys) report that they are finding the app and personalized home screen valuable.
    * Proxy: App Store reviews, App Store ratings, Reddit posts: 
        * App store reviews, for versions containing the personalized home screen, report valuing the app more than versions that don’t.
        * App store ratings, for app versions containing personalized home screens are on average higher than versions without it.
        * The prevalence of Reddit posts that express valuing the app trends with the adoption of app versions with the personalized home screen
4. **Task completion:** Veterans who see a personalized home screen complete tasks at a greater rate than those who do not.
    * Direct source: App analytics for defined tasks.
    * Proxy source(s): UX research for defined tasks using design mockups.
5. Veterans who initiate tasks from the personalized home screen have **greater longevity with the app** than other initiation points (home screen vs. other)
    * Direct source: App analytics for defined tasks.
    * Proxy source(s): UX research for defined tasks using design mockups.
6. **Engagement with personalized content** on the home screen.
    * Direct source: App analytics to be defined per content item on personalized home screen.
    * Proxy source(s): UX research using design mockups.

*Note that engagement metrics, in particular, will be greatly expanded as the UI/UX for the specific feature, like home screen for example, is determined.*


## Assumptions and Risks
### Assumptions



* Personalized content relating to their interactions with VA is valuable to Veterans and will lead to **higher app adoption**.
* Veterans will **value personalized content** so highly that they keep **returning** to the app. 
* Surfacing personalized information at a level above its corresponding feature will make it easier for Veterans to **keep track of their interactions** across the VA and be **made aware of related actions**, without having to seek out when their attention is needed.
* App users _want_ to **feel that ‘the app knows me’ and** seeing information related to them on the home screen makes them feel known, supported, and reassured.
* Personalized content will help to accurately set expectations and **increase understanding of what the app can do** for them.

### Risks & Mitigation

#### Risks: 

* We’re not sure that users will find value or greater convenience in surfacing personalized information outside the existing features.
* We’re not sure which pieces of personalized information (or what level of detail) will be most valuable for users to see on the home screen.
* Displaying personalized information from too many APIs in one place might cause app performance to suffer.
* The home screen becomes overgrown & a dumping ground over time without proper guidelines and governance.

#### Risk mitigation: 



* Setting up ways to measure our success to understand if our concepts are useful to Veterans. For instance:
    * Define qualitative ways to test out the value of a personalized home screen with Veterans
    * Define quantitative metrics that provide indicators that a personalized home screen is useful
* Engineering spikes to understand limitations and design that takes those limitations into account to provide the best experience despite them.
* Create and document a framework and workflow for integrating new personalized content. Socialize it with feature teams. Add personalization conversation to feature kickoffs.
