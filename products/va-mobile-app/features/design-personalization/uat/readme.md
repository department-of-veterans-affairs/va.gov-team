# User Acceptance Testing

## Goals of pre-launch UAT
The personalized home screen includes information from Health and Benefits features as well as personal information. Our primary goal in conducting pre-launch UAT is to ensure data is displaying accurately and the home screen elements are working as expected. 

## Decision: We will focus on data accuracy 
We will not be testing the completion of tasks (i.e. things like sending a Secure Message or canceling an Appointment are not things we are specifically asking participants to do). We will focus on whether data is displaying accurately across the Home, Category, and feature landing screens. 

## Decision: We will do internal UAT
- Because we are conducting [Evaluative User Research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-research/personalized-homescreen/2024-04%20Personalized%20Home%20Screen%20-%20evaluative%20research) with external participants, we will do internal UAT only. 
- We conducted sessions with # people at VA and Ad Hoc who had their own identity proofed (LOA3) credentials. We ran sessions from [dates].
