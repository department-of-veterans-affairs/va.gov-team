## Home Screen Quantitative Measures of Success
This page contains quantitative data intended to measure whether the home screen was successful. Each metric is defined by a type:
* Observational - these metrics, which are generally feature specific, provide information about how Veterans are using the feature but do not indicate success
* Leading - these metrics may indicate that the personalized home screen was sucessful
* Lagging - these are metrics that provide high confidence as to whether the feature was successful or not

While lagging indicators, like retention rate are strong indicators of value for Veterans, qualitative feedback, through user interviews, would provide a faster and more holistic view on whether the feature was successful.
