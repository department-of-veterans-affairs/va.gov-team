## Background

**Goal:** Identify research insights from existing VA studies to help inform our approach to personalization in the VA mobile app. 

**Approach:** 
In May 2022, we reviewed existing VA research reports for insights related to personalization in the Benefits & Health spaces (2016-2022):
Sources: Internal (VA Mobile team + VA.gov teams) & external consultants (Frog, Harvard students). In Jul 2023, we surfaced findings related to notifications in the topline findings after reexamining the original review for newly relevant callouts. 
* Benefits: 8 reports
* Health: 4 reports

## Topline findings: Summary of insight themes related to personalization 


### Veteran behaviors & motivations (general - user context)

#### UNDERSTANDING & STAYING INFORMED

Veterans **want to understand their benefits and how to access them, what VA is doing & needs from them.**

1. Veterans **care about anything they have in flight**, whether that is education or other benefits. <sub>1,2,3</sub>
   * They **want to know where they are in the claims process** —Timeline for benefits decision not explained, back & forth status is confusing. <sub>2</sub> 
   * They want to know **what’s going on now**, how long it will take, and what happens next.<sub>2</sub> 
   * Veterans **check the status of their benefits claims frequently** and through multiple channels in the **hope that they can find better or more up-to-date information**. <sub>2</sub> 
   * Veterans **often call VA or VSO staff or visit in person to get the detail they want**, as typically the call-center representatives can't access that information. <sub>2</sub> 
2. Veterans want **ongoing guidance** after separating from service so they can **continually learn about what benefits are available to them** and how to apply on their own terms. <sub>2</sub> 


#### SEEKING A SENSE OF SECURITY IN A SYSTEM THEY DON’T ALWAYS TRUST

Veterans want to control the things they can in a large and confusing system that they can’t always rely on to deliver the benefits they’ve earned.

1. **Veterans** **want to feel like they’re in control** [of any process], but the VA benefits process makes Veterans feel like they’re not in control.
2. **Veterans** store files themselves because they **don't trust VA to safeguard their personal documents** for posterity and **are concerned with documenting their service connected disabilities for fear of losing access to care**. <sub>2,4</sub> 
3. **Veterans** **don’t trust the accuracy of the claim status** they see on eBenefits. <sub>2</sub> 


#### COMMUNICATION & CONNECTING

Veterans **value empathy and communication**. 

1. Veterans **trust and want to connect one-on-one with individuals** who **know the details of their specific case** to help them.
   * They **want to talk with VSOs, Claims Staff,** and other **VA service providers** when they have questions or need help. <sub>2,3</sub> 
   * Veterans **often call VA or VSO staff or visit in person to get the detail they want**, as typically the call-center representatives can't access that information. <sub>2</sub> 
   * They seek out **in-person discussions** about their case **to get questions answered** (more quickly and thoroughly than online).
   * Veterans also **rely on their peers, friends and family for guidance** in navigating the benefits process. <sub>2</sub> 
2. Veterans use **social media and online communities** to keep in touch with others going through the process, to **learn about shortcuts** or alternative ways of getting things done, and to receive **updates**. <sub>2</sub> 
3. In addition to getting quality health services, **participants want to feel heard by their providers**, and they **want proactive and timely communication** from the VA about their health needs. <sub>5</sub> 
   * They use secure messaging because they know that providers are required by law to respond within a set amount of time. <sub>2</sub> 
   


### Veteran pain points (general - user context)

1. Navigating VA ecosystem is **so complex and confusing** that **Veterans feel discouraged** to apply for, manage, and maximize their benefits. <sub>3,5</sub> 
   * A lack of ongoing benefits training leaves **Veterans at a loss for what they're eligible for** and **how to get started** with benefits. <sub>2,3,4,5</sub>    
   * Often Veterans have a hard time finding the right information—they **don't know the right VA terminology or questions to ask** (so they spend too much time searching for things online).  <sub>2,3</sub> 
   * Veterans **have to rely on in-person services **to access benefits. Participants with** cognitive disabilities removed themselves from the process out of frustration**. <sub>4</sub> 
   * Veterans have to **connect the dots between pieces** of the **fragmented system on their own**, and often have to **retell their story**. <sub>5</sub> 
     * Veterans **manage** **their personal information** (and dependent PII) alongside financial information, medical records and notes, documents from their time in service and documents from VA, **across many online systems** and through **ad-hoc analogue processes**. (p64) <sub>2</sub> 
         * They are **[constantly filling out the same paperwork](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/161RAuAzRjqx3qeS-w3O1rYMZSDh8QoTu/edit#slide=id.g84f66474e1_0_748)** <sub>3</sub> 
     * Participants had **difficulty with the fragmented experience** between MHV, eBenefits, and VA.gov. The fragmented experience is inaccessible for Veterans with cognitive impairments. <sub>4</sub> 
         * **‘Document and store everything’** is the mantra of Veterans who have filed disability claims. (p48). 
         * Veterans are **concerned with documenting their service connected disabilities for fear of losing access to care**. Veterans think of their health record as a crucial component of their disability benefits. <sub>2,4</sub> 

2. Veterans **feel ‘in the dark’ during their benefits journey.**
   * They don't know **what VA is doing**, **what VA needs from them**, or **how to get help.** <sub>2</sub> 
   * From application to decision, **they don't understand the claim timeline, their progress,** or what decisions mean.<sub>2</sub> 
   * **Veterans don’t know how to get help:** When Veterans have questions throughout the claims process, there is **no guidance from VA as to where they can receive help beyond the 1-800 number. Finding the right person** at the VA can be **complicated and confusing.**<sub>2,3</sub> 

3. **For many, interacting with the VA benefits system involves dealing with uncomfortable feelings.**
   * The VA benefits process makes Veterans **feel like they’re not in control, and feeling vulnerable goes against military conditioning.** <sub>2</sub> 
     * Many participants had to **overcome shame in order to identify that they were deserving of VA benefits**.<sub>5</sub> 

4. **Veterans want to feel heard, but often don’t.**
   * **Veterans are rarely asked for feedback during the claims process:** Veterans **want to give feedback**. <sub>2</sub> 
* Veterans **want to feel heard by their healthcare providers**. <sub>5</sub> 


### What Veterans say they want from a home screen:

1. **Veterans want their experience to be task-based** (**actionable**!), streamlined, and expect a mix of links and widgets to complete tasks from their home screen. <sub>1,2,5,6,7</sub> 
   * They want to **be able to quickly see what needs to be done, act on it and get off the [site]**. <sub>8</sub> 
   * Participants would prefer VA communications that are **timely**, give a clear sense of **what to expect and when**. <sub>9</sub> 
   * Veterans **value** a system that **allows them to manage their claims and documents** to the best of their ability. This management includes **timely notifications**, **shortcuts to streamline frequent tasks**, and **secure messaging** to receive answers on demand. <sub>2</sub> 

2. **Veterans want their experience to be tailored to them**—a “digital version of themselves.” <sub>2</sub> 
   * **Veterans care about anything they have in flight**, whether that is education or other benefits. <sub>1,2,3</sub> 
   * **Features vary in importance to Veterans depending on their circumstances** or life stage and they expect their personalized screen to reflect that <sub>1</sub> 
   * Veterans **want to see benefits they may be eligible for** and benefits they are unaware of.  <sub>2,3</sub> 
   * Some Veterans are interested in **being able to customize** their logged-in homepage (although this is less common as of late).<sub>1,2,7</sub> 

3. **Veterans prefer clear, simple design** (an easy to scan list of top tasks, approach to presenting health info) to avoid info overload. <sub>2,5,7</sub>  


### How Veterans think about notifications*
*These findings are based on existing research conducted on the MHV, MyVA, and VSA websites (not the mobile app), compiled in May 2022, added to topline findings in Jul 2023*  

1. **The word “notification” gets used in studies and by Veterans to mean both “alerts” in general and something more specific:**
   * ‘Notifications’ are different than action items:
       * In one study, Veterans made a **clear distinction between an 'action item' (something that the Veteran needs to DO)** and a **'notification' (something that the Veteran should know).** They want to be able to quickly see what needs to be done, act on it and get off the site.
   * ‘Notifications’ is also used throughout other studies to describe any kind of alert.
2. **Veterans expectations around where Notifications might live varies between studies.**
   * Users expect to have a **centralized alerts page** (VSA authenticated experience).
   * Users expected to see notifications and updates at the top of their logged-in **MyVA home page.**
3. **Veterans expect specific attributes of Notification content and have expectations about their order of prioritization.**
   * **Prioritization/order of notifications:**
       * **Time-sensitivity and unexpected problems** should be prioritized. (if something is going to expire, or if something is time-sensitive they would want that to be called out in some way that they can't miss)
       * Importance of an individual alert depends what is happening in a Veteran's life.
   * **Notification content:**
       * The best notifications are succinct (**brief and action-oriented**), **personal** (applies to me and my life), **reassuring** (the things I set up to happen on a recurring schedule are happening), and **timely** (shows up when I need the information). 
       * Participants want consistent information across all channels.
   * **Notification topics mentioned by Veterans**(*mentioned more than once)**:**
       * **Health:** Appointments*, Prescription refills,* Messages,* Physician referral approvals
       * **Money:** that they owe, or are owed*
       * **Benefits**: Claim status,** Education, benefits that Veterans are entitled to, Home loan info
       * **General:** Approaching deadlines (e.g. 3 days left to provide document), Changes to VA benefits or policies that impact them, Veteran organizations available to join

**[VA Mobile Comparative Analysis: Personalized App Screen](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/features/design/discovery/personalization-comparative-analysis.md)**  (Nov 2021)
1. Relevant user information presented in **card layout design**
2. Several apps allowed users to **favorite or save individual content** that was then consolidated on one screen—usually the home screen.
      * BUT Few apps allowed the ability to customize a personalized screen by allowing users to define the kind of content that was included and how that content would be arranged.
      * Several apps included a **recent and/or suggestions section**
      * Few apps included the **search functionality** in the personalized screen. The search function was typically another navigation screen in these apps.
3. **Recommended Features**
     * Have relevant content on the personalized screen that provides users with meaningful information.
     * Provide users a way to select the kind of content they see on their personalized screen. Either by allowing them to favorite the content they want to display on their personalized screen or by allowing them to edit the personalized screen by adding, removing, or rearranging content.
     * Provide users with a “recent” section on the personalized screen so that they can navigate back to previously accessed content.
      * Consider including a “suggestions” section on the personalized screen that could provide users with information or features they may be interested in.

Method: interviews, card sort
1. Mobile app features people were interested in: Being able to request military records; having the ability to update contact information; uploading documents; **seeing status updates**, receiving **appointment reminders**, and **sending secure messages**; and **getting help in a crisis**.
2. Features people were less interested in: Comparing GI bill benefits, having the ability to sign in for appointments, viewing payment history, adding VA docs to their Apple/Android wallet.

   * **Pain points:** 
        * Almost all of the Veterans we talked to had **challenges with the VA stemming from fragmented administration**. These included:
            * [Having a hard time finding the right information](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/161RAuAzRjqx3qeS-w3O1rYMZSDh8QoTu/edit#slide=id.g84f66474e1_0_748)

Method: interview, codesign, secondary research

**Recommendations related to personalization:**
   1. **Tailored content:** **Serve up** benefits **information** that is **personal and relevant to the Veteran** based on what is known about **each individual.** (p92)
        * Veterans **don't have time to search around** online for what they might need to know. Often Veterans **don't know the right terminology or questions to ask**.
        * **Notify Veterans of important updates** like upcoming appointments, job opportunities, pending payments and claims status changes.
        *  **Show the information** that is **most relevant or used the most** by them. This includes areas such as Dashboard, Quick Links and To-Do links. It's easy to find **local service providers and programs.**
 2. **Snappy tasks:** Enable Veterans to get **snapshot views** and **take common actions quickly. (p93)**
       *  Veterans want to **quickly check on**, **download**, **update** and **schedule** any VA service in **one digital place**– often before running out the door.
          * pending and past payments
          * view and pay health bills like copay.
          * quickly access personal forms
          * get relevant search results without having to use 'VA Jargon'.
             * make, view, change, confirm and get directions for appointments across the VA
             * see a quick overview, including status, of all benefits, claims and appeals they are actively engaged in
3. **Document access:** Aggregate personal information and documents in one location. (p94)
4. **Connections with people:** Facilitate digital and physical connections between Veterans, their loved ones, VA staff, and 3rd party support lines. (p97)
      * Veterans have questions about benefits eligibility, resources and claims. **They want to connect one on-one with people that can help them.**
           * Find and talk to a VSO
           * Discuss a benefit or service
        * Exchange knowledge with friends

**Generative Research & Co-creation Findings**
1. Build your dashboard activity 
* **Veterans** (p85):
   * Veterans **value** **a system** that allows them to **manage their claims and documents** to the best of their ability. This management includes **timely notifications**, **shortcuts to streamline frequent tasks**, and **secure messaging** to receive answers on demand. 
    * Secondarily, Veterans **see value in** enhancing their profile so the VA can make **relevant benefit recommendations**.
* **Staff** (p86):
   * Highly ranked **secure messaging** with VA that also ties into Veteran surfaced **notifications**. 
   * From a **self-service perspective**, staff members felt that Veterans would like **profile** information, **service history**, **payment** information, **an actionable to-do list**, and a flexible method to **search** the site.
* **VSO reps** (p87):
   * Claims dashboard should include useful information like relevant **profile** information, **service history**, and **timely notifications**, it would also be beneficial for Veterans to have access to My HealtheVet features like **secure messaging, payments, **and** prescription** info.
2. Concept card activity (p82):
* **Personalized dashboard** (ranked #2):
     * Veterans want the dashboard to be a **digital version of themselves** and have **all of their information in one place**
        * Veterans want the dashboard to be **simplified and avoid info overload**
* **Recommendation engine** (ranked #4):
     * Veterans want to **see benefits they maybe be eligible for** and benefits they are unaware of
     * Veterans like the idea of Turbo Tax's **"If you do this, then..."** way of presenting benefits and options

**Foundational Research & Findings**
1.  Recurring painpoint themes throughout benefit journey that personalization can address:**Feel in the dark, I don’t know what to do next, it doesn’t always work, had to retell story, feeling not in control** (p79)
2.  Veterans **rely on their peers, friends and family for guidance** in navigating the benefits process. (p37)
    * Veterans **want to feel like they’re control of any process**.
    * The current claims process makes them feel **vulnerable, which goes against military conditioning**.
    * Veterans use **social media and online communities** to keep in touch with others going through the process, to **learn about shortcuts** or alternative ways of getting things done, and to receive **updates**.
3. A lack of ongoing benefits training leaves **Veterans at a loss for what they're eligible for and how to get started with benefits**. (p40)
    * Veterans want **ongoing guidance** after separating from service so they can **continually learn about what benefits are available to them** and how to apply on their own terms.
    * Veterans are **confused about what benefits they're entitled to**, the difference between eligibility and entitlement, and **which benefits they can apply for online**.
4. **‘Document and store everything’** is the mantra of Veterans who have filed disability claims. (p48)
    * Veterans store files themselves because **they don't trust VA to safeguard their documents for posterity**. A paper process that is touched by multiple people has resulted in scanning errors and lost files that discredit VA.
5. **Veterans don’t know how to get help** (p53)
    * When Veterans have questions throughout the claims process, there is **no guidance from VA as to where they can receive help beyond the 1-800 number.**
6. From application to decision, **Veterans feel in the dark**. They don't understand the claim timeline, their progress, or what decisions mean. (p58)
    * Veterans **do not know where they are in the claims process**—Timeline for benefits decision not explained, back & forth status is confusing
    * VE Research Finding 2 (p58, 61): Veterans want three primary things no matter their claim type, separation date, personal story, personal disability etc: 
        * They want to know **what’s going on now**, how long it will take, and what happens next.
7. Veterans **don't know what VA is doing** or **what VA needs from them**(p61).
    * Veterans **check the status of their claims frequently** and through multiple channels in the **hope that they can find better or more up-to-date information**.
    * Veterans **often call VA or VSO staff or visit in person to get the detail they want**, as typically the call-center representatives can't access that information.
    * Users **don’t trust the accuracy of the claim status** they see on eBenefits.
8. Veterans **manage their personal information** (and dependent PII) alongside financial information, medical records and notes, documents from their time in service and documents from VA, **across many online systems** and through **ad-hoc analogue processes**. (p64)
    * Veterans can't swiftly access the information they're looking for in eBenefits (p66).
      * Veterans **need to know ‘VA speak’ for search to be useful**
        * Veterans spend too much time searching for things because **they don't know the proper VA terminology or keywords to search for**, making search results irrelevant. (p66)
        * Secondary Research Finding: **Daily visitors report lower satisfaction scores than less frequent users**.
9. VE Research Finding 13 (p69): Veterans are **almost never asked for their feedback during the claims process**, or during the appeals process. The few times they are asked to provide feedback, inconsistencies in methodology exist between facilities and touchpoints.
    * **Veterans want to give feedback**. This aligns with their **desire to be heard**.
10. Role of personal info: “The VA should be able to get this information. Why do I have to provide it?”
11. Veterans seek to **connect one-on-one with someone who knows the details of their specific case** (p74).
    * Veterans find that **in-person discussions** about their case **get questions answered **more quickly and thoroughly than online. **They want to talk with VSOs, Claims Staff, and other VA service providers when they have questions or need help**.
    * Veterans have a **hard time reaching** a representative at the VA **benefits call center **and when they do, the** information is not useful or accurate**.
    * Veterans **want to have contact with a person that is familiar with and knowledgeable about their claim**. Further, they want to talk to someone who can give them specific, actionable information.
    * Veterans **typically find VSOs helpful and trust them** to handle their documents, navigate the process, and successfully submit a well formed application for review.
    * Secondary Research Finding: Visitors resort to calling the Benefits helpline or emailing when faced with an unsuccessful application.


### Personalization: Health



**[My HealtheVet Personal Information Discovery Research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/100)** (March 2022)
Method: interview, card sort
* The participants who receive care at multiple facilities *did not have a need to select or deselect facilities** in their “My VA Treating Facilities” list.
* [Research in June 2021](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/research/may-2021-facilities-personalization-research/research-findings.md) exploring the value of adding preferred facilities to the VA.gov profile showed that **selecting a preferred or current facility from a list of registered facilities was not a useful feature to Veterans**.

**[Veteran preferred facilities research report](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/research/may-2021-facilities-personalization-research/research-findings.md#recommendations)** (July 2021)
Method: prototype
* Recommend **surfacing helpful facility information** for the Veteran **based on their data**, instead of asking them to manually manage facilities in the scheduling flow or their profile.

**[Veteran health experience and patient portal research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/research/generative-research-study-1/OCTO%20health%20research%20report%2022%20Mar%202021.pdf)** (March 2021) 
Method: interviews

**Recommendations related to personalization:**
1. Make the **patient portal experience the constant in an otherwise varied health landscape.** Veterans should have access to their health information online,**shown in a holistic, simple, and actionable way.** (p24)
    * **Communicate proactively.** Use effective channels all Veterans can access to **share** health **information** or **events**.
2. Create a clear path between websites for health tasks.
    * Veterans should be **taken directly to the information and tools they need**, especially when tasks are distributed across multiple websites.  
**Foundational Research & Findings:**
1. The VA ecosystem is **so complex** that **Veterans feel discouraged** to apply for, manage, and maximize their benefits. (p25)
    * Veterans are **unaware of what benefits are available to them or how to apply**. Many participants had to **overcome shame** in order to identify that they were deserving of VA benefits.
2. Veterans have to navigate multiple health care systems, providers, and insurers to get the care they need. (p27)
    * Veterans value empathy and **communication**. In addition to getting quality health services, **participants want to feel heard by their providers**, and they **want proactive and timely communication** from the VA about their health needs.
    * **Lack of timely, personalized care.** Veterans and caregivers feel they have to manage their expectations about timeliness and receiving individualized attention because of the high turnover of providers and sheer volume of patients served by the VA.
    * **Most participants had to seek care outside of the VA to meet their health needs.** While some were referred out through the Community Care program for speciality services, others **leveraged separate insurance to receive timely and personalized care from providers outside the VA.** 
    * Participants had **difficulty with the fragmented experience** between MHV, eBenefits, and VA.gov. The fragmented experience is inaccessible for Veterans with cognitive impairments (p29)
3. Veterans trust the My HealtheVet brand because it offers the **fastest, easiest method to complete health tasks**.  (p36)
    * Participants found My HealtheVet easy to use and secure. 
    * “Your 1-stop shop for everything health care related” (p37)
4. The MHV homepage tools reflect users top health care tasks (p38)
    * Overwhelmingly, participants used and valued MHV for its 4 tools featured on the homepage banner. **Pharmacy, Appointments, Messaging, and Health Records** tools were the most valuable.
    * Participants **do not use or find value in self-entered data or resources.** Veterans and caregivers felt the transactional tasks were captured on the homepage, and did not explore additional resources.

    * Veterans are **unaware of what benefits are available to them or how to apply.** Many participants had to **overcome shame in order to identify that they were deserving of VA benefits**
    * Veterans have to rely on in-person services to access benefits. **Participants with cognitive disabilities removed themselves from the process out of frustration**.
    * Veterans are **concerned with documenting their service connected disabilities for fear of losing access to care**. Veterans think of their health record as a crucial component of their disability benefits.

    * Veterans continue to go to MHV and eBenefits **because they are familiar and they have what Veterans need.** 
    * Participants had difficulty with the fragmented experience between MHV, eBenefits, and VA.gov. The fragmented experience is inaccessible for Veterans with cognitive disabilities.
    * Participants struggled to complete health tasks whenever those tasks took them outside MHV. This included copay, travel pay, and scheduling appointments.

        * Design IA and content in a way that **clearly shows the relationship between health care and disability and helps Veterans make decisions**.
      * [Give Veterans a consistent, consolidated sign-in experience for all VA digital services.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/research/generative-research-study-1/research-findings.md#opportunity-4-give-veterans-a-consistent-consolidated-sign-in-experience-for-all-va-digital-services)
        * Veterans should not have to manage multiple credentials and websites to manage their benefits.

        * 6 out of 8 users expressed that the [**personalized**] My VA page **should be the first thing they see when they log in**.
        * Many Veterans in this study mentioned that the current **VA.gov** experience is **designed for the general Veteran population - not for them specifically**. When they saw the My VA page and the alerts page, they immediately began relaying scenarios in which they would use this new personalized format.
    * [Central alerts page](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/action-items-discovery/research/alerts-discovery-research-summary.md#central-alerts-page-1)
        * Most users want to be able to **visually differentiate between old and new alerts**. 4 out 8 participants **expected** anything that is **time-sensitive and expired to 'disappear'** all together (e.g. an appointment that has passed).
        * 5 out of 8 users wanted **alerts to be sorted into categories** (like on the homepage or on My VA). This included the ability to filter alerts by category or date. 3 out of 8 mentioned wanting the ability to customize what alerts they see on their alerts page.
    * [Prioritization](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/action-items-discovery/research/alerts-discovery-research-summary.md#prioritization-1)
        * Users made a **clear distinction between an 'action item'** (something that the Veteran needs to DO) **and a 'notification' **(something that the Veteran should know). They wanted to **be able to quickly see what needs to be done, act on it and get off the site**. Other 'notifications' were important, but much less than something that requires action from them.
        * All users mentioned **time-sensitivity and unexpected problems** as something to be prioritized. (if something is going to **expire**, or if something is **time-sensitive** they would want that to be called out in some way that they can't miss)
    * [Things Veterans mentioned they'd want to see as an alert](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/action-items-discovery/research/alerts-discovery-research-summary.md#things-veterans-mentioned-theyd-want-to-see-as-an-alert)
      * Annual amount of disability compensation

* Most users could not point to what was **'the most important alert'**- many mentioned that it **completely depends what is happening in a Veteran's life.** Most users **did not expect the VA to know what the most important alert was**. A few users also mentioned wanting to have the ability to customize alerts and choose which ones were a priority.
    * Many people said that **if there is something that is going to expire or you have to be somewhere at a certain time** - that would make an alert important.
    * **Time sensitivity** is an important factor when it comes to prioritization
    * Almost all users prioritized the unfinished form alert and the appeal hearing reminder, closely followed by appointments

     * Prescription refills
     * Claim status
     * Approaching deadlines (e.g. 3 days left to provide document)

Method: usability test, interview
* The best notifications are **succinct** (brief and action-oriented), **personal** (applies to me and my life), **reassuring** (the things I set up to happen on a recurring schedule are happening), and **timely** (shows up when I need the information). (p15)
    * Participants would prefer VA communications that are **timely**, give a clear sense of **what to expect and when**, and provide **consistent information across all channels**.(p14)
    * It is **not a universal standard for participants to receive text messages** as part of a suite of notifications from organizations. (p14, 22, 23, 24)
        * Less secure
        * Texting is for personal communication, rather than formal communication with an organization
        * Harder to access from a computer or to search
        * Long responses are harder to type on a phone

**Customization**
   * [Customization vs. Personalization in the User Experience](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/customization-personalization/) (NNG) (2016)
        * Personalization and customization both have the ability to enhance a user’s experience on a site, **but they should not be used as a fix for a broken site**. 
        * **Personalization:**
            * Goal: deliver content and functionality that matches specific user needs or interests, with no effort from the targeted users.
            * Pro: improved user experience that **doesn’t require any extra effort from the users** because the computer does all the work.
            * Con: user is **at the mercy of the computer**’s ability to guess what they need
        * **Customization:**
            * Goal: lets users make their own selections about what they want to see, or set preferences for how information is organized or displayed, enhances user experience because it allows users to control their interaction.
            * Pro: each user can get **exactly what they wan**t, because **they are in control**
            * Con: **many users don’t know what they actually need** and that **most users are not interested in doing the work required** to tweak the user interface to match their preferences.

**[Customization of UIs and Products](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/customization-of-uis-and-products/)  (NNG) & [Customization Features Done Correctly for the Right Reasons](https://media.nngroup.com/media/reports/free/Customization_Features_Done_Correctly.pdf)(NNG)** (2009)
* Websites that let users customize the UI have the same measured usability as regular sites.
* **Business Benefits of Customization**
    * Increased Traffic and Loyalty: offering customization increases the number of users who will visit the site and choose it as their start page
    * Reduce Operating Costs: moves analog processes online, reducing cost
        * Usability Challenges on Customization Sites
            * Interface customization [task success](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/success-rate-the-simplest-usability-metric/) matched that on non-customization websites, with an average completion rate of 83%
            * Users generally reported feeling **more lost and less in control on the customization websites** (53% feeling oriented, 63% feeling in control)
            * For interface customization, the **main problems relate to <span style="text-decoration:underline;">discoverability, findability, and comprehension</span>**— that is, getting to the customization in the first place, and then finding and understanding the available options. To reward first-time users with an early success experience, sites should better explain features and provide fast-tracked workflows. In our study, for example, iGoogle's promise to create a simplified personal homepage "in under 30 seconds" was successful and encouraged users to start experimenting with the service. 
        * **The Importance of Good Defaults**
            * Despite its benefits, many users don't avail themselves of customization features. **Users exhibit a strong bias toward simply getting things done on a website, rather than spending time fiddling with preference settings.**
            * It's better for users if the design team decides on a single good, coherent user experience. **Customization options should be reserved for those features that offer substantial user benefits**, thereby compensating users for the time spent on customizing the UI rather than on accomplishing their tasks.
        * **Customization: Effective When Implemented Correctly**
            * Interface Customization - applicable best practices
                * **Explicitly invite users to customize their experience** and avoid using brand names for links.
                * Provide a **first-time “quick set-up”** to familiarize users with the concept and illustrate possibilities: Users will be more likely to take advantage and optimize their use of customization features if the **initial time commitment is low** and they realize they **can make additional** adjustments afterwards at their discretion.
                * As part of quick set-up, show users how to further customize: Once users have completed a quick set-up process, it is useful to show them how to make additional customizations.
                * Offer examples of intention-based customization to illustrate usefulness and serve as templates for shortcut customization (show them how a custom page could serve their specific needs)
                * **Provide thorough content/tool previews to help users decide which to include on their pages**.
                * Utilize “related items” navigation to make users aware of other content/tools.
                * Indicate when an item has been added to the user’s custom interface or any other change occurs.
                * Provide customization-specific help.
                * Confirm content deletion requests.
* **Personalization**
    * **[Personalization is Over-Rated](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/personalization-is-over-rated/)** (NNG, 1998)
