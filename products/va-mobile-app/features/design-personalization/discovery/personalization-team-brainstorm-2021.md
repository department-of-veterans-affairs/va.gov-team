## Background & Goals

The VA mobile app launched with a home screen that displayed the same information and features for every user. [Initial beta testers provided feedback](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-research/prototype-testing/testing-summary.md#a-customized-home-screen-is-highly-useful) that they would want to customize their experience to include features that are important and useful to them. We conducted a brainstorming session with VA Mobile App team members and stakeholders to gather ideas around how we might explore offering a personalized experience to Veterans in the app. 

The brainstorming session asked participants to consider ideas that would fall under the following categories:


* Things the app/device knows about me
* Things the VA knows about me 
* Things that I know are important to me

## Takeaways 


### What is the benefit to Veterans?

Most participants answered that a personalized Mobile App would benefit Veterans by:

* Allowing Veterans to be informed about updates or changes to their items (i.e. appointments, claims, prescriptions; etc)
* Creating a sense of trust and security with the VA and its services 
* Reducing confusion and time spent finding features that they need 

### Personalization ideas

The brainstorming session yielded many ideas on how the Mobile App could be personalized to better meet the needs of Veterans. Those ideas include:

**Favorites**

* Allowing Veterans to favorite features or items that matter to them
* Allowing Veterans to customize the features or type of content they want to see

**Feeds of newest items and notifications**

* Surfacing updates, changes, alerts, or reminders for a Veteran’s items
* Surfacing important VA announcements or updates

**Suggestions and related items**

* Surfacing recently accessed features or items so that Veterans can easily access them again
* Showing a to-do or an agenda of items the Veteran needs to get done
* Remembering or auto-filling data in certain areas of the app (i.e. letters and secure messaging)
* Suggesting items or features a Veteran might be interested in based on their eligibility, past actions, or life circumstances
* Being able to connect related areas of the app together (i.e. being able to send a secure message when looking at prescriptions)

**Search**

* Adding a search bar that allows users to search the app

**Organization**

* Surfacing a Veteran’s service badge icon on the home screen
* Enhancing the settings screen and separating it from the Veteran’s profile

**Interactions**

* Allowing users to be able to dismiss or snooze items

**New users**

* Onboarding and welcoming for first and non-technical users

**Sharing**

* Allowing Veterans to share certain information with others (i.e. being able to share a secure message via text)

**Dashboard**

* Display key info and stats (disability rating, My VAMC)
* Displaying the last login date
* Allowing Veterans to set what screen the app opens on

**Appointments**

* Allowing users to change or update their appointment from the app
* Allowing Veterans to check into their appointment from the app
* Showing waiting room times (i.e. showing when the Veteran will be seen by a provider after checking into an appointment)  
* Allowing the app to connect to VA kiosks 
* Suggesting nearby doctor’s when a Veteran is making an appointment

**Secure Messages**

* Suggesting providers based on a Veterans previously messages providers
* Surface list of Rx in secure messages

**Rx**

* Providing prescription tracking status or information
* Notify when approaching refill time
* Allowing users to scan prescription barcodes
* Connection to SM if need to message doctor

**Profile**

* Including a family profile or subaccount that allows dependents to access benefits

### Moving Forward

From the brainstorming output, the VA Mobile App design team will focus on incorporating the ideas that have a high impact on Veterans and require low implementation effort. 

**Next steps:**

* Add to the lo-fi designs with ideas generated from the brainstorming session
* Meet with development to review lo-fi iterations and discuss technical limitations
* Conduct a usability test of a selected lo-fi iteration with Veterans
* Synthesize data from the usability test 
* Go through an iteration cycle of hi-fi designs
