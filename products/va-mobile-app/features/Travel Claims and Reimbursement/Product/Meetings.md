4/10 Matt/Adam chat
 * Travel Claims and reimbursement is off the table for Q2 and not something that should be referenced at this time for considerations
 * Matt said to send him the use cases and not to talk to Mark Dewey as our team is not supposed to communicate on Travel Claims, so the use cases I send Matt he will forward to Rachel who then will talk to Mark 


3/22 Weekly Meeting agenda: 
 * Leads reviewed with Adam what they did on 3/20 and also the use cases identified
 * Leads pushed to share all the use cases
 * Identified another use case to add to their six, in-app notifications, which makes the use case total 7
 * From a leads perspecitive TCR was now on hold until future prioritization which was believed given PO push on TCR from the 3/15 SoS convo from Chris J
 * Discussed meeting early Q2 keep communication with Leads going

3/21 SoS Meeting agenda: 
 * Travel Claims and reimbursement was a topic with Chris J
 * Travel Reimbursement Step 1 review - Adam [Travel Claims and Reimbursement Step 1 Product Canvas.pdf](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/files/12499886/Travel.Claims.and.Reimbursement.Step.1.Product.Canvas.pdf)

 * OCTO trying to get API team to refocus on Travel but they are still working on other priorities
 * Real time API may not be available until end of Summer 2023
 * Are there other versions of this API that will be available sooner?
 * Chris thinks we could move forward without RT APIs and once its submitted whenever we get a response then tell the Vet even if its seconds / minutes/ hour later 
 * Told Chris I would follow-up with him when I am back on the use cases and then share it with Mark

3/20 Travel Claims Use Case Review 
 * Meko was walking through the leads on the overall Travel Claims Reimbursement Experience and user flow prior to identifying and finalizing use cases 
 * use cases identified were documented on the mural board (https://app.mural.co/t/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/m/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/1678367303512/32e5c8830a50f953be69ecc024c5efa9a4cd3419?sender=u7ec1ac1ea3bde48882e36908)
 * Adam was not in attendnance 

3/16 SoS Meeting agenda: 
 * Travel Claims and Reimbursement were discussed 

3/15 Weekly Meeting agenda: 
 * Review used case in Mural - not completed 
 * Vote from use cases in mural - not completed 
 * Review draft timeline - completed 
 * Identify research timing 

Meeting notes: 
 * Reviewed drafted timeline 
 * Liz updated on research status that research will be held off on based on discussion with Jen/Matt
    * This reinforced for the use cases, last meeting's decision of using existing research and knowledge to determine our top 3 use cases 
    * Intent is still to propose some research into the projected timeline as all agreed research would be needed 
 * Re-reviewed the definition of use cases
    *  Use cases we submit as are not stuck in stone to do 
    *  Use cases are to help inform Octo on what Mobile would like to do to influence future API creation/work
    *   Design, UX decisions are not required for this stage - those will be done once we get into Step 2 
    *   Use the information we know to proceed 
 * Discussion on new some items on the board
    *  Shout-out to Lauren adding to the board! 
    *  Orange, blue , grey have all different meanings 
    *  Orange written out like a task - similar to how use stories are written up - pulled from Lauren's product management class 
    *  Grey specific details not use cases - talked about how they can be use stories / feature 
    *  Push to API use case discussion
     *   Items tied here are tied to other use cases 
     *    Discussion on this pushing and pulling data 
     *    Push data when submitting claims - API inputs 
     *    Pull data when getting claims details based on available databases - api outputs
     *    Talked about how that is part of the other use cases 
   *   Data specific items to be capture during Step 2 
      *   Could leverage Holly's document as items to think about when determine key results 
 * Leads referenced comments about Travel Claims being postponed, delayed, shelved
   *  Adam asked if this happens to reach out to him 
   *  Work being done now on Travel Claims shows work is ongoing
   *  As from past convos its possible that it gets paused for a little because productionalized APIs are blocking us but expect there will be work on it when unblocked

* * Action items:* * 
* Adam to update timeline to account for new meeting and moving the voting meeting - completed 
   3/20 -  Use Case Review (new) - just scheduled
   3/22 -  Leads will vote on top 3 use cases (moved)
   End of March Mark to receive 3 use cases 
   Step 1 review with Chris - TBD 
* Lauren to fill in the other columns on the mural board for the use cases she added  
* Agreed to schedule a discussion meeting to review the use cases in mural
   Adam to schedule prior to next meeting to review the use cases in preparation for voting on 3/24 - completed on 3/22
   Unable to find a hour so will use 30 minutes;
   All Leads -  given time constraint asked to do some prep ahead of time
     Review Mural Board Use cases, optional review past notes / docs 
     Add questions in the question column using a sticky note 
     Purpose of this meeting is to review use cases in preparation on voting on 3/24
     Any questions or items needed prior - reach out to Adam - do not wait till the next meeting 





3/8 Lead Discussion

Review last week's action items 
*  Research 
  Would like to do short-term research to interview Mobile Veterans however with recent convos and also bandwidth this may be challenging to do in time for the use cases
  Agreed that Travel Claim Research is still valuable and needed
  Travel Claims for Check-In may not start their pilot until early 2Q and we may not start till after they learn so we have some time for more indepth research 
  Research topics - learn from the travel desk, accessibility 
*  Discussion on use cases 
   Use cases we submit as are not stuck in stone to do 
   Use cases are to help inform Octo on what MObile would like to do to influence future API creation/work 
   If research or other info leads us to shift from our best guess use cases that is acceptable 
   Submitting use case does not mean we will not release in phases to reach those use cases vs all at once
*   Direction of Travel Claims 
   Travel Reimbursement is still on Chris' list of things he wants to work on 
   Work is still blocked 
   Adam is working with Matt in proposing new timing
   Adam talked about the potential of being a follower of the Check-In team's pilot
   Learn from them and pull in the TR Simple Claim piece 

 * Decisions: 
   Agreed for the use cases, we use existing research to determine our top 3 use cases and vote next meeting 
   Mobile will not complete new research for use case - research may happen later in the project

* * Action items: * * 
   Create Mural Board with use cases - Adam - done 
   Work on updated proposal (timing / steps) for Travel Claims with Matt - Adam 
   Team to add use cases for Travel Claims before next meeting's voting 

* Mural board: https://app.mural.co/t/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/m/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/1678367303512/32e5c8830a50f953be69ecc024c5efa9a4cd3419?sender=u7ec1ac1ea3bde48882e36908



3/1 Leads Discussion on Next Steps for 3 use cases 
* Meeting notes: 
 *  Answered the 2 questions posted in QA shared worksheet, reviewed answers in the meeting 
 *  Reviewed how we should define use cases for Mark 
   *  Keep it high level, do not need to go into fields, comps, details initially
   *  Mark can come back with questions and we can handle accordingly
   * We will work what goes into the doc like "Jobs to be done" 
  * Identified that end of March is not a hard and fast due date but would like to back into a due date to help put milestones/action plan together 
  * Agreed to use the same time moving forward weekly to review TR 
    * If actions / items needed prior to next meeting bring them up vs waiting for the meeting
    * Start with 30 minutes, if we end early we end early 
  * Discussed research needs
    Short term to use existing research to help influence what further research is needed
    See if there are plans on what TR looks like at different facilities 
    Given the long term aspect of TR there may be opportunity for a more focused, detailed study 
* Action Items:
*   Estimate timing needs for research work - Liz 
*   Share use case document to team - Adam - done see link
*   Review use case document along with what existing research says for priority of use cases - Liz/Lauren
*   Have FE assigned to epic - Adam - done 
 *   Per Binny they should only be included when there are front in design / functionality, given this is not part of our current needs they will not be asked to attend the meetings 



2/28/23 Mark Slack
*   Reached out for proof of concept API documentation, which he sent
*   Sent the documentations to Jayson to review 
*   Shared that high level use cases are fine. If its a crazy complex idea then maybe lo-fi comps may be needed. just wants enough details to show to team and say this is the stuff they are looking to do, lets peel it back
*   End of March for 3 use cases would work for Mark
*   They are targeting end of March to get the API working in order to restart the check in pilot



2/15/23 Matt 1:1 - Follow-up on TR
*   Adam offered to do a write up on status / updates 
*   Discussed what mobile team can do
    Can we jump the line and get them over the finish line
      Check-In team has at least 9 months of work on us with an existing pilot just waiting for the API to be usable 
      They have a working pilot / experiment its just slow cause of the POC API 
      API is needed - we cannot speed that up; we can influence future APIs with Mark’s ask of the 3 TR use cases in Mobile 
*     Governance play / strategy 
      Talked about running as an experiment for a product / feature
        That is what Check-In is doing 
      Think about strategy on governance
     Could use this as an example for the basic needs Mobile needs before proceed, if they do not have that what do we do
 *  No info on how Check In team is moving forward in regards to the pilot halt



2/15/23 Slack message with Mark Dewey
*   Check In Team pivoting from pilot with some short term stress - no additional details, next steps, timing, etc provided - felt they were still figuring it out 
*   Recommend a biweekly async Slack check in until there is more momentum 
*   Still feels there is opportunity to influences what are in future API builds that would be used to incorporate into the mobile app 
*   Said the 3 use cases should be mid-high priority; not needed now but getting them in on the ground floor of the work is best - so not time table 



2/14/23 - Sprint 0 
*   Chris asked for update & confirmed their pilot is on hold
*   Reiterated our dependency on APIs(that are not yet built or sustainable) to do TR other than an information page  
*   Chris also felt just adding an info page and connecting to a poor experience is not ideal 



2/14/23 - Team of teams Update 
 *  Pre-Check In Pilot with TR Simple Claim put on hold 



2/10/23 - TR overview for Ad Hoc leads
 *  Re-reviewed parts of the Sprint 0 - user experience flow, problems 
 *  Created a QA doc for the leads to add to  
 *   Leads are hesitant on the research that exists, mobile may need to do one 



2/8/23 - Lead Meeting w Lauren, Misty, Liv, Meko
 *  Meko recommended this team, as they already had talks about TR during their Check In sprint 0 prep work prior to pulling out TR 
 *   Reviewed Mark’s 2 asks but prioritized the 1st - add information to the app about TR like VA.gov 
   Something we can control and do now, resolves some research findings 
   Leads felt that an info page in the app is not ideal plus to link user to BTS3 site which is not mobile or accessibility friendly is a poor experience 
 *   Created a Slack channel with this group to do async discussion and created a QA doc, per their request, for leads to fill out for future discussion
 *  Leads felt more research was needed though there has been 2 associated with it in the past 1 year or at least interview mobile veteran users 
 *  Asked for a walkthrough on the user experience - said we can revisit the sprint 0  



2/6/23 intro meeting with Mark via Slack
*   Aware of the limitations and challenges with BTS3
*   Reconfirmed all that was seen in the Check In Team Discovery with Travel Reimbursement work 
   Working to improvement TR experience but there is no access currently within the BTS3 walls - APIs are needed
   POC API for Simple Claim but poor response time 20 seconds - API was never intended for production use, purely a proof of concept 
*   Pilot team reviewing if they want to test with 20 second latency 
*   Octo wants to build additional APIs - eligibility check, claim look up, expand simple claim submission, etc 
    Said we could help influence this by sharing our top 3 use cases
*   Mark recommended our next steps are 2 asks; outside of this there isn’t anything to do 
    Add an informational section to the mobile app regarding TR similar to what VA.gov 
    Provide top 3 ideal use cases to what mobile would do with TR to help Mark in preparing future APIs for RT 



1/31/23 Sprint 0 reviewed 
 *  Details on data, user experience, mail / online, etc 
 *  Pulled in research from Octo Path Analysis June 2022 and Check In Team Discovery with Travel Reimbursement which led to learnings such as 
 *  Online TR claim process currently has no integration points for the Mobile or any team to use  
      Submitting, viewing, status, associating to an appointment, seeing reimbursement payments, etc
      Thus the mobile team can’t develop or plan to develop as there is nothing to work off of 
 * Check-In team since at least 2Q 2022 was preparing a Pre-Check In pilot that includes a single use case for TR they are calling Simple Claim 
    Check In Team Discovery with Travel Reimbursement
    Simple Claim = mileage reimbursement only for round trip using their own vehicle
    They planned to used a proof of concept API to do the TR 
      API only did simple claims but had 20 second response latency
      Again proof of concept build, not productionalized 
    Check-In Team performed research, collaboration and discussion with impacted teams
    They have created and finalized an entire customer experience journey and UI for the pilot 
    Pilot was only going to be for a couple VA locations as not all use check in
  * Chris said to work with Octo Mark Dewey for all things related to TR
