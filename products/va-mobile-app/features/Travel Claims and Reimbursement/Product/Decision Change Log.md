### Running List of Changes and Decisions

| Change | Rationale | Date Change |
|-------|------- | -------- | 
| Excluding Travel Claim in Payments  | Functionality is not yet supported for Mobile to use | 8/25 |
| Inclusion of travel claims into Mobile check-in is not part of this scope | Mobile check-in not ready yet and working through other items so instead want to create a ticket to Travel Claims to it in mobile as a backlog item | 8/25 |
| Rachel agreed to pull out original ACs / Test B focusing on doing claim submission for Travel in Flagship's Claim feature | Slimming down original MVP in order to get the feature out faster, get value faster, and get learnings faster. The claim's work portion is a little more complex given its the first time Flagship starts a claim from scratch and mobile will need to do some cross feature work to prevent duplicate travel claim submissions. Created Epic [6604](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/va-mobile-60f1a34998bc75000f2a489f/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app/6604) for the Travel Claims Submission in Claims work  | 8/28 |
| Ability to change the order of the questions  | Using data determined that the no receipts question 1st would require fewer veterans to go through more questions than needed. More details in [Slack thread ](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C05Q9HH47PS/p1695228214961209). Kay and Mark agreed. Added to web check-in's backlog. Update: Web Check-in team pushed this release 4/5/24. [See details in DSVA Slack](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C03CGTDLTFF/p1712329605453859).  | 9/20 | 
| Project to be referred to as Travel Reimbursement not Travel Pay | Historically the Travel Pay was used by mobile. To create consistency we all should use Travel Reimbursement. Content team to connect on this topic again per Danielle 9/21  | 9/20 | 
| Mark and Rachel confirmed they are open to putting in a Travel Pay widget in Appointment, Claims, and Payments. Design to move ahead with this in-mind to see how it would look. During 10/28 meeting Design (Lauren) should the ability for mobile to create a "widget" of sorts that could allow Veterans to start their Travel Claim from different areas in the Mobile app but use the same funnel | Low lift to do this from an engineering perspective, enablement to see where Veterans are going to submit travel claims through tracking and monitoring | 9/28 |
| Design/Content decisions to date | Since we are setting this project down as of this date, here are design and content decisions we've made to this point. (1) Countdown of days left to file claim on list view; not mentioning "Eligible for travel" as that confuses appointment eligibility vs Veteran eligibility (2) Details view mentioned Veteran can file a mileage-only claim; sets expectations (3) Link in details view goes to full panel with brief overview of Veteran eligibility with external link to VA.gov static page on travel (4) Shorten BTSSS on Question 2 & 3 screens; approved by Danielle (5) Different copy on home address question screen from Check In team; mentioning home address can't be Post Office box as more of a note (6) Review screen may need research on if we need to include appt date as reminder to user (7) Review screen may need agreement checkbox; Mark Dewey was going to look into this and what is legally needed (8) Success screen gives claim number and context on what a Veteran can expect to happen next (9) "No" screens set timeline expectation as well as other ways to file claims and help info; same with error screen (10) List view will show claim status at bottom of the card, not as a status tag so as not to conflate multiple statuses in the feature (11) Details view will include claim number, status, and a short description of status | 10/13 |
| Content decision on status definitions | We were given several versions of status definitions. Content feels it's important to provide at least some context to these statuses on the Details View once a claim is in process. But some of the definitions we were given are just too long and too much content to add to the Appt Details View. It would make the screen less about the details of a past appointment and more about the travel claim. Therefore, our recommendation is to eventually rewrite these definitions to shorter, more plain language versions that align with the VA style guide. But as we are putting this project down after Sprint 82, we don't have time to rewrite them now. We decided to rewrite one definition to include in our design mocks to show as an example. If/when we pick this work back up, Content can work on rewriting all status definitions and getting approval from Sitewide Content. | 10/13 |
| Mobile Step 2 / Design on hold after Sprint 82 | Removing 2 sprints of work regarding gathering feedback and applying feedback. This is because of multiple items - ongoing work on backend APIs design is dependent on, lower in priority vs other items by the POs, need to shift work given PM staffing changes in Q4 | 10/13 |
| Mobile Research - on hold | Presented research ideas on 10/11 - prototype/findability study and generative study. Informed another VA.gov team is doing generative research and Mobile can sync up with them for collaboration but expectation is that Mobile does not lead a multi-team research. The prototype / findability study determined by POs not to take place in Q4. Will revisit when project gets reprioritized. | 10/13 |
| Mobile to create a clickable Figma prototype. Confirmed that any changes requested of the prototype will be put on hold until Mobile presumes work on this project. Mark confirmed via [Travel Pay Slack](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C05Q9HH47PS/p1697197772290819) | Beneficial for the Travel Office Stakeholder reviews. Also deemed beneficial as a way to wrap up Mobile's work this sprint/ quarter. Prototype can also be beneficial in share with others in the VA.  | 10/18/23 | 
| Per Rachel, Rachel is stepping away from PO decision making. Mark Dewey will be the Decision Maker. Design - government design lead continues to be Ryan Thurwell. Kay is the Product Lead on unified appointments and optional attendee in meetings where mobile team members interact with Mark. If Travel experience affects other sections of the app: Benefits, payments, home, health features outside appointments. hypothetical scenario: we want to add a Help section for travel when no other experience in the app has "Help," but there are pros/cons to having "help". b. Prioritization decisions, e.g. when mobile team picks up Travel again | None provided | 10/18/23 via [Slack](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C05Q9HH47PS/p1697651373029479) |
