Submit Claim provides a response after a claim is submitted. What are the responses that indicate submitted successful, submission declined, and system error? 

What is the timing for the new API that will speed up the BTSSS decision engine (reduce the 30+ second response time)? Will this be in Vets-API? 

What is the timing on getting Check-In Travel Claim fields into VETS-API?

Mobile would like to use Get Claim to see if any appointment is eligible for travel claims? Any load concerns?

Mobile would like to use Get Claim to indicate if there was a claim submitted for any past appointment? Any load concerns? 

VAOS has statuses such as arrived, booked, no show. Are these the status Mobile should use to identify if a Veteran has checked in to an appointment? If so what fields equate to being checked in or not checked in? 

**Closed Questions**

| Question |  Answer |
|--------|----------|
|   direct veterans to web app for more complex use cases?| yes |
|   does a "checked out" appointment = past + confirmed appointment? | no|
|   Do we need to direct Veterans out of the app to BTSSS for any reason (view claims, contact BTSSS, etc? | yes, after submission they can only find info on BTSSS site.  Yes - current web functionality only handles simple claim submission (can't find, view status, see payments - this is all done on BTSSS) to BTSSS and confirmation that the claim was accepted or denied is done through SMS|
|  What is the limitations / focus on the web version? | Check-in travel claims prototype handles only claim submissions for simple claims (round trip mileage from home to VA facility) and currently on for only a few VA facilities. |
| What are the upcoming changes that are taking place? | What are the expectations of mobile in aligning in the future?  Mark to share details |
| Concerns / impact to manual review process which research has indicated is high?|  70-80% already manually reviewed, we did not see an increase just that instead of paper its done via web. Intent for the future is to move these from manual review to automatic review which would save manual review hours / expense |
| Best place to include Travel Claims ?| Research found its a 50/50 split between Claims/Benefits and Appointments |
| Are the APIs stable enough to expand volume / submissions through the mobile veteran population?| Any other API limitations to be aware of.  No concerns at this time. Current structure is good at handling volume. The latency of 25-45 seconds is running the claim through business logic. Currently working on improving that speed (coming soon).  Will need to revisit as additional API changes / integrations are done. |
| Can the ACs be supported with existing functionality? |All but inclusion of payments in the mobile app as that is now a roadmap item. Confirmed with the group on 8/24 steps 1-6 can be supported and should be the focus. |
| What kind of call center training was needed when introducing this functionality?|  Mobile should work with the call center to see what specifics are needed outside of the BAU Product Guide update. Note the though all VA Facilities use this system they all use it differently which causes challenges in handling. Checkin Travel Claims Prototype has a FAQ |
| Confirmation that Check-in travel claim prototype does not require authentication. For mobile, we require authentication, can that be support? If so can we use that to improve the experience (pre-populate date, etc). | Having this feature behind authentication has no impact on the feature. |
| Any concerns with wireless connectivity being required, been reports on it wireless accessibility at VA facilities? |  Not applicable as Veterans can submit through the app at anytime. No tie in with Check-In travel claims (sidenote this is being looked into in that space). |
| Heard that some travel claims may not have appointments like service dog or transplant care? Is this true? Are there other limitations to be aware of? |  Mark / Kay do not believe so but Mark will look into it. |
| how do veterans and VHA use "checked out appointment"? any impact to current functionality?|  No impact or work mobile need to worry about. Historically to submit a claim the appointment needed to be checked out and in the past 30 days. For the Claims Travel Claims Prototype they are submitting TC after they are checked in so the BTSSS API was adjusted to allow for claims to be submitted after they are checked in vs waiting till checked out. As the team explores moving from manual review to systematic review that team will need to work further on how that works with checked-in status. Again nothing for mobile to worry about - logic /decisioning is on BTSSS side not Mobiles. |
| Can mobile access the same logic web TC prototype is using for targeting the specific VA locations? What is the logic?| At this time there is no logic to align with Check In TC facilities. Its possible it could be done but does not exist today. Confirmed during 8/25 that we do not need to follow Check-In TC facility rollout.  Mobile's implementation would allow Travel Claims to be submitted for any facility. |
| How does this handle multiple appointments? | BTSSS system prevents duplicate submissions. Recommended that the client side (Mobile) adds FE restriction logic to prevent Veterans from submitting a Travel Claim again if done through the app. This will improve the UX. In the event that the client restriction logic does not work the BTSSS business rules will decline the claim request thus no risk of extra payouts. Claim can only be submitted for 1 appointment per facility per day within a specific radius (this is done on BTSSS Business engine). So if there are 5 appts in Pitt VA then only  claim.  |
| Were there any kinds of reviews / approvals that were needed for web travel claim prototype mobile may need to be aware of? | No unique approvals were needed for the Check-In Travel Claim prototype so suspect none for this project. Teams involved and Mobile PO expected to lead approvals. Recommended that the UX designs should be shown with the Office of Travel like the Check-In TC Prototype did for reference and not approval  | 
|  Once a claim is submitted how do we know they are not submitting it a second time? Do it through the SmS then later on Mobile. | There is no current functionality for mobile to know if a claim was previously submitted or not in another channel. Mobile should add FE restrictions to prevent a Veteran to submit the same claim in the mobile app twice. BTSSS will decline duplicate claim requests for the same appoint. Veteran will be notified by SmS if rejected and may later get a letter with more details |
| What happens when claim request to the API fails due to error? | Veteran will receive a SmS telling them the request failed and to submit the claim request a different way. SmS text example are in the document section |
| For the Get Status API, is there a plan to add the amount | Current amount is not added to it but if its something we want we can investigate adding. Thought is amount would be helpful given TC claims will not be in Payments of the mobile app given its backlog item of BTSSS |
| What client frontend restriction logic does mobile need to add | At this time believe its only logic to prevent the Veteran from submitting a claim in the app more than 1 time. Kay talked about maybe filtering some appointment types like admin type (no details on these specifics). Mark to look more into frontend client restrictions are needed |
|What types of appointments are currently supported | So currently the only stop codes we have in place are for telehealth to handle automatically. Any other non supported appointments go to manual review currently. VTP is working on creating a CR for additional stop code configurations though, that will provide us a larger list of non supported appointment types to update for auto denial. Safe to display submit claim for all non-telehealth appointments |
| Are there test tools or test accounts that can be shared with Mobile for testing? | Any test users in the staging MPI and have appointments in Vista 500 are able to be used in testing. More details in [the existing testing docs](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/beneficiary-travel/engineering/test.data.md). There are 2 ways you can check if your claims is created, you either query the API or look in the BTSSS admin portal. Let me know what folks you want to give access to the BTSSS portal in the lower environments.| 
| Get Status API - what kind of claims are returned (simple claim only? all Travel claims ever submitted?) How far back does the history go? | The status API takes a date range for appointments and return any claim for appointments in that data range. The history goes back pretty far and should cover most views as it will return all claims. According to the code, there is no upper limit, but I of course, the bigger the time frame the more data gets return, and all the challenges that come with bigger data | 
|  Are there situations in which the Veteran submits a claim but does not have texts enabled? What happens? | The claims submission currently does not send any digital communication. Its only paper. For perspective of the Check In app, the Veteran initiates the SMS workflow so that is the Veteran consenting to SMS messages. Its on the roadmap to do more with notifications and travel pay. Mobile would get a success code back with a message saying yes/no/error only for claim submission.  This is NOT claiming approval or processing | 
| If a Veteran has not given consent to use their phone for text communications will an email be sent?  Is it possible that Veterans do not consent in using text or email for communications and how does Claims submission handle that | he claims submission currently does not send any digital communication. Its only paper. For perspective of the Check In app, the Veteran initiates the SMS workflow so that is the Veteran consenting to SMS messages. Its on the roadmap to do more with notifications and travel pay. Currently mobile would get a success code back with a message saying yes/no/error. And that yes/no/error is only for claim submission, NOT not claim approval/processing |

| Given mobile is using an authenticated experience, can mobile prefill simple claim questions for the Veteran - last name ,DOB on the simple claims questionnaire. Or can we skip the Verify Identify (log-in) page since they are authenticated already. | That page is truly there to verify identity in the check-in simple claim workflow. Mobile app already covers that as an authenticated experience; therefore, I believe that can be skipped in the mobile app travel pay experience. |
| Currently mobile app does not show Cerner Appointments, any concerns with moving forward with this feature with Cerner appointments being excluded? | Mark - I don't think so, since the plan is to target a facility based rollout plan, we are targeting non-Cerner facilities. And BTSSS is set up to handle Cerner appointments already so there should be no issues |
|  Identified that we will not increase the # of manually reviewed claims, however with mobile app adding the capability is it possible that people that would not submit a travel claim would now? Or that people who would forget will not get reminded in the app to do so - thus an increase in volume? Thoughts on if we need to consider tracking for awareness. | We will should be tracking how many claims get created. I would be curious how much of an uptick we see. One of the goals is to make it easier and accessible to use, which would by extension increase system usage. Ideally the system will be able to create better claims in the very near future, so I wouldn't worry about adding extra claims |
| - Are there client side rules that Mobile can use to exclude Veterans that are not eligible for Travel Claims? Concern is telling the Veteran they can submit but we know they will not be eligible.  | Mark Here are the rules that make a Veteran eligible. As long as the Veteran meets 1 of the following.
Veterans with disabilities rated 30% or more service-connected (SC): travel for care relating to any condition
Veterans with disabilities rated less than 30%: travel for care relating to their SC condition(s)
Veterans receiving VA pension benefits: travel for care of any condition
Veterans with annual income below the maximum applicable annual rate of pension: travel for care of any condition.
Veterans traveling in relation to a Compensation and Pension (C&P) Examination  | 
|  What percentage of Veterans are ineligible for Travel Claims?  | Mark, I do not have exact numbers, but I have been told its the minority, north of 75%  are eligible | 
| What API and values should Mobile use to determine if an Appointment is Not checked in, checked in, or checked out? | Mark, There should be an appointment status that is in the data object for an appointment. Do you have a sample appointment object? |
|  once the submission API is more performant, is there always a default claim status available from the Get Status API right away? For example, is it typically always “Claim submitted” status? Or could the rules engine be so quick that there’s a different status available quite quickly after a claim is submitted to the BTSSS API? Kind of wondering if we need a default “in progress” status (that lives in our code) that we use before a status is available via the Get Status API. Maybe that was two questions| There will always be a claim submitted  type of status. I don't think the rules engine will ever be so fast that is happens in a request. It could be down from days to minutes at some point for a claim to be processed, so there will always be some sort of in progress state. There is like ~15 different states the claim can be in. And the Get Status API will always return the current status| 
| Has anyone ever considered digitally filling out travel form (VA 10-3542)? Its a form on the shorter side.Would we even have the tech in place to do something like this in the near future.| There is no API that exists (yet) that accepts the full form. I am not aware of how mobile handles filling in forms. There could be a route in which Mobile creates the PDF and sends it to the Travel Office, but that would put more work on the Travel Office |
| Does Veteran have to setup direct deposit before using mobile travel claims | No, if they do not have direct deposit set-up they will just get a checked mailed to their address |
| Can / will Mobile determine if a Veteran is eligible for travel reimbursement ? | No, mobile is only identifying if an appointment is eligible. If the veteran themselves if eligible is not determined by Mobile. Same with how it works today is that a Veteran can technically file a claim but may be denied cause of eligibility in the process. They would be denied upon the manual review that currently happens. We do not know what % of Veterans are eligible for travel claims though have been told its very high. |
| What are we calling this interface? | Travel Reimbursement |
