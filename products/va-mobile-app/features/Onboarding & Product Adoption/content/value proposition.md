# Value proposition

With the VA: Health and Benefits app, Veterans can manage the VA health care and benefits tasks they do most often—all in one simple app.

## Parts of value prop

With the VA: Health and Benefits app _**(specific about what part of the VA ecosystem we’re talking about)**_

Veterans _**(our core user base)**_

can manage the VA health care and benefits _**(wording from VA.gov's value proposition — a nod to VA omnichannel experience)**_

tasks _**(Veterans do a “quick” VA thing versus learning all the VA things)**_

they do most often _**(just what’s needed, not everything; personalized)**_

—all in one simple app. _**(themes we found, like “all in one place,” a “simple, easy-to-use” experience; another nod to VA omnichannel)**_


**Important note**: The approved value proposition serves as a guidepost when writing or communicating the value of the app. It can and should be adapted to suit the context in which it's applied. For example, the value prop could be shorten and changed to the second-person to speak directly to Veterans ("Manage your VA health care and benefits tasks you do most often—all in one simple app." or "The VA health care and benefits tasks you do most often—all in one simple app.")


## How we got our value prop

### Background

In July 2024, the VA Mobile App team began a discovery phase on improving the app's user onboarding and product adoption. As part of this work, we documented our current end-to-end onboarding experience and performed a gap analysis against industry best practices. Out of this work, we identified 2 problems:

 1. We weren't effectively communicating anything about the value of the app. Instead, the focus was on specific features.
 2. We weren't putting any emphasis on the app's key differentiators within the VA ecosystem.

Furthermore, our team believed we knew what the app's value proposition was. But it wasn't documented anywhere. And we weren't sure our concept of the app's value aligned with that of Veterans. 

So we determined that before any additional changes could be made to the app's onboarding experience, we needed to develop and document the app's value proposition.


### Discovery

_**Gathering Veteran perspectives**_

Over a few weeks, we gathered information on the Veterans' perspective of the app's value. We took key words and phrases from the most recent 9 months of app store reviews as well as research and user interviews that have happened over the last several years and feedback from Veterans during the app's MVP discovery activities. We grouped similar key words and phrases to reveal larger concepts about what Veterans focused most on when talking about the value of the app to them in their lives. Findings from this phase can be found in the [Insight Gathering section of this Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/ElPiSV6vy4kVw86aUxNIJo/Value-proposition---%F0%9F%A7%AA-Workspace-(FJ)---VA-Mobile?node-id=2001-2802&t=y8iu4cchNMctmhdb-4)

_**Gathering team/stakeholder perspective**_

We also completed a workshop with the purpose of gathering and synthesizing key themes of the mobile app’s value from the perspective of various stakeholders and interested parties. We didn't write the value proposition in this workshop. Instead, we collected diverse perspectives on its value and then grouped similar ideas to reveal themes. Findings from this phase can be found in the [Workshop Findings section of this Figjam](https://www.figma.com/design/ElPiSV6vy4kVw86aUxNIJo/Value-proposition---%F0%9F%A7%AA-Workspace-(FJ)---VA-Mobile?node-id=2001-4597&t=y8iu4cchNMctmhdb-4)

_**Comparing Veteran vs. team perspectives**_

After gathering all these perspectives, we compared our findings and found that our team and Veterans had a similar mental model for the app's value.

 Veteran top key words/themes included:
 1. Everything in one place
 2. Personalized/my stuff
 3. Easy of use, quick, convenient, simple
 4. Helps manage care/communicate with providers

Team top themes included:
1. All in one place
2. Focused on what Veterans need/care about (touches on personalization, simplicity)
3. Always in my pocket
4. Features that make things easier (biometric sign in)
5. Accessibility


### Drafts and approvals

Finally, our team's content designer (Misty Milliron-Grant) drafted multiple value proposition versions. She got feedback on final versions from both the team and Danielle Thierry from CAIA. Once a final value proposition was determined, Misty shared it via DSVA Slack with VA Mobile App POs (Rachel Han, Ryan Thurlwell, and Don McCaughey). Misty also presented the final value proposition at the [Sprint 110 Demo meeting](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/va-mobile-app/demo#november-19-2024-sprint-110-va-mobile-sprint-demo---sprint-110pdf).


## What's next

Having defined and documented the mobile app's value proposition, we'll  now apply it to the end-to-end onboarding experience. This could include adapted versions for app store descriptions and first-run onboarding flows. We can also apply the value prop to opporutunies for marketing improvements or in-app messaging as they arise.
