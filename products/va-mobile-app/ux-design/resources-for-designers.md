# Designing for the VA Mobile App: Getting Started  

Last updated: Dec 9, 2024

This is a list (created by the VA mobile design team) of items and resources that are essential for designers who are new to the VA mobile app (and potentially new to designing for native mobile in general) to know about as they’re getting up to speed.


## Step 1. Get familiar with the VA mobile app on your own!

Before jumping into designing for the VA mobile app, download and explore the app on your own. It's essential to do this on an actual mobile device (as opposed to looking at comps in Figma) in order to build a solid understanding of native mobile interactions in the app (and to see how they differ from web).

**1. Review the app store presence and download the app on your own mobile device:**    
* [VA: Health and Benefits - Apps on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.va.mobileapp&hl=en_US&pli=1)
* [VA: Health and Benefits on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/va-health-and-benefits/id1559609596) 

**2. Get into [demo mode for the VA mobile app](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/va-mobile-app/Mobile%20Demo%20Mode) and explore!**
* If you have more than one type of mobile device (Android, iPhone, iPad), feel free to install there to see differences between platforms & form factors


## Step 2. Explore the VA Mobile app design resources

These resources explain the key elements of the VA mobile app, including the app's Navigation model and IA, content resources, and UI resources (including our Design System, Flagship mobile design library, screen templates, patterns & components). You can also learn how the mobile app team works and our processes.

### VA Mobile App Figma Project
  * Get access to the [VA Mobile Figma project](https://www.figma.com/files/827597988283174959/team/1114266503868297401) 
  * Make sure you have access to the Design System libraries (these are the elements  that make up the VA mobile app)
      * [Design tokens library](https://www.figma.com/design/rdLIEaC9rVwX70QbIGkMvG/%F0%9F%93%90-Design-Tokens-Library---Design-System---VA-Mobile?m=auto)
      * [Icon library](https://www.figma.com/design/X8gXRl1MaRAE7lKcwgr5Rj/%F0%9F%93%90-Icon-Library---Design-System---VA-Mobile?m=auto)
      * [Component library](https://www.figma.com/design/Zzt8z60hCtdEzXx2GFWghH/%F0%9F%93%90-Component-Library---Design-System---VA-Mobile?m=auto)
  * Check out the [Design Resources folder](https://www.figma.com/files/827597988283174959/project/60961499) for additional Flagship libraries and templates


## Step 3. Get up to speed on native mobile best practice resources

If you’re new to designing for native mobile (or maybe it’s time for a refresher?), spend some time getting to know Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines and Google’s Materials design guidelines. The VA mobile app’s design is based on principles and best practices from a combination of guidelines that are used by all native mobile apps:



* [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/designing-for-ios) (iOS/Apple) 
* [Material Design](https://m3.material.io/) (Android/Google)
