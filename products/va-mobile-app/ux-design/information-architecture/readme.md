# Information Architecture

_Last updated: February 2022_

## Background & goals
The sitemap/flow diagram outlines the information architecture that the current (post-MVP) VA Mobile App's navigation follows. The goal of this diagram is to outline all the current screens and actions in the app. 

As of February 2022 this diagram is a living artifact. As the app changes, updates will be made and reflected here.

The diagram can be viewed at size in Mural: [VA Mobile App sitemap (current state)](https://app.mural.co/t/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/m/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/1642804630885/39996d58a6b48671b3119a76ef9554941ed644f8?sender=u28718b63c8993f515e0b2240).
