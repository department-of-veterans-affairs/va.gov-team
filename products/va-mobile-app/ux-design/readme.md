## MVP assets
| Asset      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [Sketch library](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-design/sketch-file)    | Sketch file with common components we used for the MVP release. Sketch file built and maintained from September 2020 to June 2021. We are moving to Figma in July 2021 to better enable team collaboration.       |
| [Sketch library - laid out in Invision](https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/console/share/AX108RJZPB6E/600511824)  | This shows all the MVP components laid out as a library visible and inspectable in Invision.      |
| MVP Mobile App UI Styles (Google Doc) | We kept track of UI specs for common components in a Google doc.      |
| [MVP prototype (deprecated)](https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/console/share/GTZ1ESFF6BN/600511542) | This prototype is a good representation of most MVP features (minus Secure Messaging), but is not up to date or being maintained as of Winter 2021. |
