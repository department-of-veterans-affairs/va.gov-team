# **VA Mobile App: Information Architecture & Navigation - High Level Project Summary**


This summary describes the background & motivation, purpose & research goals, research questions and planned process/methods for the [IA & Navgation project](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-design/information-architecture-navigation/High%20Level%20Project%20Summary.md)(part of [VA Mobile app Redesign](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/features/design/redesign-initiative-brief.md)).

## Background & Motivation

The VA Mobile app was designed to allow Veterans to more easily complete key transactions across VA Health and Benefits services. 

As the app grows in its feature set, the VA Mobile App team needs a better understanding of how Veterans would navigate benefits and health services within the mobile app. We want to ensure the structure and organization of the app makes sense and can accommodate the new features we have identified as of interest on our roadmap.

### Project Objectives & Goals 


#### OCTO-DE Objectives

The following are the [OCTO-DE objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme) that this research supports.

1. Increase the usage and throughput of VA services
2. Decrease the time Veterans spend waiting for an outcome
3. Increase the quality and reliability of VA services


#### OCTO-DE Goals

The following are the [OCTO-DE goals](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme) that this research supports.

1. Veterans can manage their health services online
2. Logged-in users can easily track applications, claims, or appeals online
3. Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features


#### Veteran Journey

* Primary point in the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf): “Taking care of myself”
* Secondary points: “Reinventing myself, “Putting down roots,” and “Retiring”


### Previous User Research

No previous research exploring IA or veteran mental models around the specific collection of content in the VA mobile app has been conducted. No previous research examining the usability of the current live VA mobile app has been conducted, however, [User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Testing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/va-mobile-app/testing/uat) was conducted in May 2021, as were several rounds of usability testing with a [Prototype in May 2020](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-research/prototype-testing) and [March 2021](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-research/usability-testing/round-1).

There has been research conducted around veteran mental models for the content on [VA.gov](https://www.va.gov/), including [Logged-in homepage: Discovery summary](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/discovery-summary.md)


## Project Purpose & Goals

The purpose of this work is to inform the information architecture, content and design of the VA Mobile app in order to deliver a solution that is usable, useful, and extensible, before we scale the app to a larger audience. This is important, as it will allow us to easily add those future features without having to make Veterans learn new navigation paths as the app grows. We will conduct user research and design activities collaboratively to quickly explore the opportunity space and deliver a solution that is user-centered and achieves product goals.


* **Phase I** of this work will give insight on the usability and comprehension of the proposed information architecture direction.
    * It describes a 3-part study that uses the following methods: [open card sort](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-research/information-architecture/open%20card%20sort), [closed card sort](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-research/information-architecture/closed%20card%20sort), and [tree test].
* **Phase II** of this work is a [competitive analysis](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-design/information-architecture-navigation/competitive-analysis). It will be done in parallel with Phase I.
* **Phase III** of this work will give insight on the usability and comprehension of the proposed UI direction.
