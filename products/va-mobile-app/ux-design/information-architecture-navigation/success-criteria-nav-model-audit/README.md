# VA Mobile App - Navigation Model UI - Explorations, Audit & Refinement
Holly Collier ([holly.collier@adhocteam.us](mailto:holly.collier@adhocteam.us)), VA Mobile UX Team

This work explores potential navigation models for the VA Mobile app. The design exploration below is based on the findings from Phase I's [Information Architecture research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-research/information-architecture) & [comparative analysis](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-design/information-architecture-navigation/comparative-analysis/README.md) and a systematic evaluation of navigation model design directions based on [success criteria established by the team & product owners](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-design/information-architecture-navigation/success-criteria-nav-model-audit/README.md#choosing-a-mobile-navigation-direction).

### Guidelines for choosing a mobile navigation model direction

Choosing a navigation model involves balancing user, business, technical, and platform considerations. We will use the following criteria as a guide to systematically audit our navigation design explorations and narrow options down to the direction/s we intend to move forward with.

### Criteria for Evaluating VA Mobile App Navigation Model UI

#### Business Goals

1. Navigation model is **extensible & future proof**
    - There is someplace for new features or top level categories to live without reworking core navigation (ex: leave an empty space in the global navigation)
2. Navigation model ensures that the **default landing screen provides space for dynamic personalization**--both personalized content (such as prescription & appointment reminders, new messages) and personalized tools (such as quick access to tools the veteran uses)?
   - Navigation model supports cross-references between stacks (ex: personalized home screen content that links to a screen within another section)*
3. Navigation model ensures that the **default landing screen provides** **space for featured content or tools**
4. **Core navigation is the same for every Veteran, on both iOS & Android platforms** (acquisition: apps are shared grassroots style & Veterans help each other)*

    _*also a technical & platform consideration_



#### Veteran Mental Models/Needs

5. Navigation model **matches Veteran mental model buckets and site map**
6. Navigation model is **accessible** (including cognitive disabilities, assistive technology, ESL, etc)
   - Allows Veterans to **parse info quickly** (less is more)
   - **Places high traffic items in an easy to reach location/** (thumb zone)
   - Uses a **clear, consistent & well-known navigation pattern,** so focus is on tasks & content, not on figuring out how to navigate the app
   - **Makes it clear where the Veteran is,** even when several levels down a stack* (ex: clear back button labels)

   _*also a technical/platform consideration_



#### Platform Considerations

7. Navigation model **adheres to native mobile platform guidelines & best practices for both iOS & Android**
   - Supports **efficient navigation to all content and tools**—easy and simple paths in and out
   - **Default/initial screen (Home) is easily accessible from any other screen** within a few taps


#### Technical Feasibility

8. Navigation model is **feasible within React Native** 
9. Navigation model **doesn’t negatively impact responsiveness/speed**
