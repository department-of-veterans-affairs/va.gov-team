## Future goals
Some of our future design goals include: 

- Increase the polish of MVP common components. 
    - **Why:** To improve the app's visual design 
- Revisit where we are using native components and where we are not, and look for opportunities to increase the native mobile UX of the app while maintaining accessibility
    - **Why:** To offer a more native mobile feeling experience that utilizes platform patterns users are already familiar with
- Make refinements & new additions at the component-level; improve documentation of components 
    - **Why:** So that building out future features & implementing refinements for existing ones is more efficient
