## Intro - 5 minutes

Thank you for joining us today! My name is Cindy. How are you doing today?

Before we begin, I want to make sure that you're comfortable with a few of my teammates assisting me on this call. I have one teammate who will be taking notes to make sure that we accurately represent your feedback. We won't link any notes to your name or other personal information.

I'm also joined by my social work colleague, [Name]. If you need support at any time during this call, please feel free to ask me to stop and for [Name] to help answer questions or provide support. I may also ask [Name] to help provide support if needed.

(For sessions with a participant using a screen reader:) Angela is also in this meeting to help with any technical issues that may arise with your use of a screen reader during this session.

Before we continue, I'd like to tell you a little more about who I am and what we’re doing...

I'm a usability researcher, and I work as part of a team that is improving VA's websites and other resources for Veterans. We reach out to Veterans as we design these resources to get their input so we can help make sure our resources meet their needs.

For this feedback session, we're here because VA is working to stop harassment and make our locations and services safer for everyone. We define harassment as any unwelcome behavior that intimidates, offends, or creates a hostile space. As part of these efforts, our team is exploring how to make it easier for Veterans to report harassment at VA. Your input could help us make the resources easier to use by Veterans like you. You'll try them out while thinking about a hypothetical harassment situation, not your own experiences.

Are you comfortable trying out resources for reporting harassment and sharing your opinions about them?

*If no:*

Is there anything we can do to make you feel more comfortable?
*[Get verbal confirmation or end session]*

*If yes:*

We've asked you to participate because you’re a Veteran, not because we believe that you have been harassed. If you’ve experienced any type of harassment in the past, conversations in this session might remind you of these past experiences. We won’t share what you tell us with anyone.

Are you comfortable proceeding with this session?

*If no:*

Is there anything we can do to make you feel more comfortable?
*[Get verbal confirmation or end session]*

*If yes:* Thank you! We very much appreciate you talking with us today. Before we start, I want to give you an idea of what this session will be like...

- **This session should take about an hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you any longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or task. Please let me know if you need a break at any time.
- **In this session, we want to get your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing you. We're testing these resources to learn how we can make them better for all Veterans. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express. If at any time you don't feel comfortable answering a question, let me know and we'll move on to the next question.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to take a break or stop the session, please let me know.** You can take a break from the session or end it altogether. You will not lose your stipend or be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
- I will be sharing a web page URL with you during the session.  
  - I could read it to you or put it in the Zoom chat. **Which would you prefer?**
    
- I'd like to record my screen and audio as we talk today to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. I will delete the recording after I complete analysis. We respect your need for confidentiality--we won’t link anything you choose to share in the session to your name or any information that could identify you. **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** 

  - *If yes:* **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording to the cloud.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 


## Screen sharing instructions (if needed)
- In the Zoom application on your phone or computer, you'll see a row of buttons at the bottom. In the center is a green button that says **Share** (phone) or **Share Screen** (computer). 
  - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.
  - (If you have more than one screen, the row of buttons may be on the screen that's being shared)

- Now I'd like you to share your screen with me. Tap on the green button that says **Share**. You will then see options for what to share. Please choose "Screen" or your web browser.
  - *(on a phone)* You will be asked to select what you'd like to share. Please choose "Screen" and then "Start now". If you see any additional prompts please read them aloud and I will help _(give permission > accessibility settings > find Zoom > check box)_. Might have to click "unlock" to be able to change the setting. It's OK to click Deny, and you don’t have to quit Zoom.
  - Great, now I can see your screen! Thank you for your patience in figuring this out.

- iPad: Broadcast screen

- *Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:*
  - Ok, it seems like we're having trouble sharing your screen, so I'm going to share my screen with you and give you control of it. Does that sound ok? *[Share your screen]*. Can you confirm if you can see my screen? *[Give mouse control]* Can you click and see if you can move your mouse around on my screen?

## Instructions for finding Zoom chat (if needed)
- In the Zoom application on your phone or computer, you'll see a row of buttons at the bottom. 
  - Computer: Just to the left of center is a conversation bubble that says **Chat**. 
    - *If don't see chat, ASK:* Do you see the red **Stop Share** button? If so, put your mouse just above it and see if you see more Zoom controls. Then click on the **Chat** button in the center of the Zoom controls.
  - Phone or computer: On the far right is a **More** button or **3 dots**. Tap that and then on Chat or the conversation bubble. 
  - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.

## Protocol for Recognizing & Handling Trauma-Triggering

### OBSERVE the participant
*Be PRESENT with the participant. Notice their body language, tone of voice, and the environment*

- *Prolonged silences*
- *Shifts in tone or attitude or interactivity*
- *New background noises*
- *Staring into space* 

### If notice a change, SAY one of these:
  - Sometimes talking about these types of experiences can be difficult. Do you think you would be comfortable telling me if it starts to affect you negatively?
  - I realize this is hard. Would you like to take a break or stop?
  - I sense that this may be upsetting. We value what you’re sharing with us, but we don’t have to go there.
  - Would you like me to stop recording?
  - Do you want to just sit here quietly for a few minutes?
  - Would you like to pause, or are you OK with continuing?
  - Is this not a good time for this session?

### Social worker/clinician on the session (or on standby) jumps in to provide support, if notice triggering

## Warm-up Questions - 5-15 minutes (depending on whether show poster)

*NOTE how to share URL: dictate / Zoom chat / email / text* 

Let’s start with a question...

I'd like you to imagine that you or a friend went to a VA medical clinic today for a doctor's appointment, and on the way in, a person said something rude and made a sexual gesture that made you or your friend feel uncomfortable. You or your friend think more about what happened and decide to report it to hopefully prevent it from happening to other people. What do you think you or your friend would do? 
- *(don't / report it / talk with someone/police at VA / call 911 / google)* 
  
- Can you tell me more about why?
- What do you think you or your friend would do next?

  - *(Google / Facebook / MHV / eBenefits / Contact center call or email / VA.gov / In person / _______________)*

### For sighted participants
Say that while you were at VA, you saw a poster about reporting harassment, but you're no longer there. How would you find information about reporting harassment now? 
- *(ask someone / google it? / VA.gov? / ____________________)*

### For sighted participants on desktop
Now I'd like to show you a poster and get your feedback on it. *(share my screen with poster and give mouse control to participant so they can move around)*
- What are your impressions?
- *(Note especially any sentiments/feelings they express re safety, comfort, trust, confidentiality)*
- *(Pause to allow as much time as the participant wants to read/process the poster)*
- What do you think you or your friend would do next if you wanted to report the interaction I described earlier--a person said something rude to you and made a sexual gesture that made you feel uncomfortable?
  - *(call 911 / call 800 # / talk to patient advocate / police / building security / ____________)*
- What other thoughts do you have about this poster?
   
### For participants using a screen reader
Say that while you were at VA, someone mentioned that you could report harassment, but you're no longer there. How would you find information about reporting harassment now? 
- *(ask someone / google it? / VA.gov? / ____________________)*

What assistive technology are you using today?

How would you rate your level of experience with using a screen reader--beginner, intermediate, advanced, or expert?

How long have you been using a screen reader?

Are you wearing headphones today? I'm asking so I will be able to hear your screen reader during the session.
  - *(if on desktop)* Could you please share your audio with me on Zoom?
  - *(if on mobile)* Would it be possible for you to take them off and use your computer or mobile audio? 

## Start screen sharing
Are you OK continuing with the session? We can take a break if you want to.

I'm going to share with you a web page. While you're looking at it, I would like you to *talk aloud* as much as possible so that you share what you're thinking, what you're doing, what you like, what you dislike, and what you're unsure about. 

I would like you to share your screen with me so I can watch you use the web page in your web browser. 
*(refer to Screen sharing instructions above, if needed)*

What kind of device are you using today? *(Phone / Computer)*

I'm going to (spell/put into the Zoom chat) a link for you to open (https://staging.va.gov/hrt). *(If asked, reassure that this is a legitimate link to what I want you to test.)*

Do you see the link?

We would like the harassment reporting resources to meet the needs of ALL Veterans who may have been harassed at a VA site. If you've ever experienced any type of harassment at VA, and are willing to share, we would like to know a little more about your experiences. I'm not asking for details, and I don't want you to re-live these difficult experiences. Your feedback today has been valuable, even if you decide to not answer the questions I'm about to ask. If you share anything about your experiences or someone else's with me, what you say will remain confidential. Are you comfortable if I ask a few more questions?
- Have you or anyone you know ever been made to feel uncomfortable by someone else at VA while applying for, using, or communicating about your VA benefits or health care? *(yes / no / decline to answer)* 
- If you or your friend was harassed, was it reported? *(no / yes)*
- If so, *how* was it reported? *(phone call / in person / ___________)* 
- If it wasn't reported, what were the barriers to reporting it?

How would you prefer to report any future harassment? *(phone call / in person / online somehow / _______________)*
  
*(If they share anything about a harassment experience, say...)*
- I am sorry you (or your friend) had this experience. We appreciate you sharing this with us. Your story will inform how we provide resources to help Veterans in the future. 
- If you (or your friend) want to report your experience with harassment, that can be done in person at a VA site or by calling the VA Inspector General Hotline at 800-488-8244.

Is there anything else that we haven't talked about that you think I should know? 


## Thank You and Closing - 5 minutes

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on providing resources for reporting harassment. We're hoping that by providing such resources, we can make VA safer for everyone.

I'm going to stop the recording now. *(STOP recording)*

Before we end this session, are there any questions or concerns that you wanted to express?
