# Research Plan: Harassment Reporting Landing Page & Poster
Public Websites team, Feb 25, 2022
 	
## Goals	
The purpose of this research is to get user feedback on the new static landing page and poster about harassment reporting at VA. From these resources, we would like Veterans to know how to report harassment at VA.

## Background
If a Veteran experiences harassment or other inappropriate behavior while at a VA Site, they can report it by calling a phone number at VA. A recent Congressional act _(H.R.2452 - Deborah Sampson Act)_ mandated providing harassment information online, which will be available from the VA.gov website. We would like to get user feedback on a new static information page and poster before they launch.

## Research questions
1. How do Veterans today report harassment at VA? *(e.g., talk with someone/police at VA, call 911, google)*
2. How would Veterans find out how to report harassment at VA? *(e.g., ask someone, google it, VA.gov)* 
4. What are users' reactions to the poster?
    1. What sentiments/feelings do they express? *(quotes about safety, comfort, being heard, treated with compassion, trust that they will be believed, confidentiality?)*
    2. How would they report harassment? *(e.g., 911, other phone #, in person)*
4. What are users' reactions to the static landing page? 
    1. What sentiments/feelings do they express? *(quotes about safety, comfort, being heard, treated with compassion, trust that they will be believed, confidentiality?)*
    2. Feedback on content, organization, and/or length of page?  
    1. How would they report harassment? *(e.g., 911, 800 #, VCL, in person)*
    6. What do they expect will happen after they report?
    
5. How do Veterans prefer to report harassment? (ask at end) *(e.g., in person at VA, via phone, via online form on phone/tablet/computer)*
    
## Hypotheses
1. Veterans will feel comfortable reporting harassment that occurs at VA.
2. Veterans will learn from the poster how to report harassment that happens at VA.
2. Veterans will learn from the static landing page how to report harassment that happens at VA.
3. Veterans will understand what will happen when they report harassment at VA.

## Method
We will conduct remote moderated research sessions via Zoom with both sighted and visually impaired participants. 

1. *ONLY participants on desktop and NOT using a screen reader:* **Show the poster** on the moderator's computer with mouse control given to the participant. Participants will be able to view the poster and scroll it.
2. *ALL participants:* **Show the static landing page** on Staging by giving participants a URL to open in their browser. Participants will be able to view the page and interact with the content, opening and closing accordions.

## Participants and Recruitment	
Because harassment is a potentially triggering subject, we want to be careful about recruiting people to participate in this research. We would prefer to get Veterans who have experienced harassment at VA and are able to participate in research sessions without re-triggering the trauma that have experienced. Our plans include the following:
- Provide an overview of the session for Perigean personnel to read to potential participants and then ask if they are comfortable participating.
- Work with VA contacts to find social workers or clinicians to observe the sessions with the Veterans and provide support if trauma-triggering occurs. 
- Limit the number of observers in the session to **one** team member (plus the moderator, a social worker, and a Perigean notetaker for a total of 4 people in the Zoom room with the participant). 
  - For each session with a participant using a screen reader, invite an accessibility specialist as an observer to help with any technical issues.

### Participants to recruit

Ask Perigean to recruit **15** Veterans in order to get **8-10** completed sessions using the following criteria:

### Must have for participants
- ALL are Veterans
- ALL are comfortable talking about harassment at VA and sharing their opinions about it
- ALL have a computer, tablet, or smartphone and be willing to be complete their interview on one of those devices 
  - During the session, be willing to share a web browser window on their device
  - Have a working microphone on their device
  - Have Zoom downloaded to their device prior to the session and know how to share their screen
- At least 1 person who uses a screen reader
- At least 2 people who plan to use their desktop or laptop computer for the session
- At least 2 people who plan to use their smartphone for the session

### Good to have for participants
- 2 or 3 people who use a screen reader
- At least 4 women
- At least 2 men
- At least 3 people who identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender
- At least 2 people of color
- At least 1 participant 55 or older
- At least 1 participant 35 or under
- At least 2 people with a cognitive disability (e.g., TBI)
- At least 2 people who don't have any degree or vocational training after high school (to include enlisted Veterans)
- At least 1 person that has a college degree (to include officer Veterans)
- At least 2 people who live in a rural or remote area
- At least 1 person who lives in a major metropolitan area
- At least 1 non-native English speaker

### Additional questions to ask in the screener
1. VA is working to stop harassment and to help make our locations and services safer for all. We define harassment as any unwelcome behavior that intimidates, offends, or creates a hostile space. As part of these efforts, we are exploring online resources to make it easier for Veterans to safely report harassment at VA. Feedback from Veterans like you will help us make sure that these resources meet your needs and are easy to use. Are you interested in trying out resources for reporting harassment and sharing your opinions about them? 
    1. No *(don't recruit)*
    2. Yes *(ask the next question)*
1. First, we want to stress that we’re contacting you because you’re a Veteran, not because we believe that you have been harassed. We also want to make sure everyone who participates in a feedback session knows exactly what to expect so you can decide if you’re comfortable participating. If you’ve experienced any type of harassment in the past, conversations in the feedback session might remind you of these past experiences. Our researcher may also ask you a few questions about whether you’ve experienced harassment at VA and how you reported it. She won’t ask you to share any details about the experience. And you can choose to answer only questions you’re comfortable answering or end the session at any time. We won’t share what you tell us in a feedback session with anyone, and we won’t link your name or other personal details with your answers in any of our records. Would you feel comfortable participating in this feedback session? 
    1. No *(don't recruit)*
    2. Yes *(ask the next question)*
1. What type of device will you use to join the feedback session? *(record in Participant Roster and Schedule)*
    1. Computer
    2. Phone
    3. Tablet
3. How well do you speak English?
    1. Not at all *(record as "non-native English speaker")*
    1. Not well *(record as "non-native English speaker")*
    1. Well 
    1. Very well  
4. It is important to us that the services and applications we design meet the needs of all Veterans. We ask the following question to ensure that we conduct feedback sessions with representative populations. Do you identify as transgender or as any of these sexual orientations: gay, lesbian, or bisexual? *(record in Participant Roster and Schedule)*
    1. Yes
    2. No
    3. Decline to Answer
