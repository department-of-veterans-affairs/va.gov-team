# Research Goals

The purpose of this research was to get user feedback on the new static landing page and poster about harassment reporting at VA. From these resources, we would like Veterans to know how to report harassment at VA.

# Research Questions
1. How do Veterans today report harassment at VA? 
2. How would Veterans find out how to report harassment at VA? 
4. What are users' reactions to the poster?
    1. What sentiments/feelings do they express? 
    2. How would they report harassment? 
4. What are users' reactions to the static landing page? 
    1. What sentiments/feelings do they express? 
    2. Feedback on content, organization, and/or length of page?  
    1. How would they report harassment? 
    6. What do they expect will happen after they report?
    
5. How do Veterans prefer to report harassment? (ask at end) 

# Methodology 
We conducted hour-long remote moderated research sessions via Zoom on **March 14-18, 2022** with **14 Veterans**. Each session started with questions about how participants would report a hypothetical harassment incident and where they would look for information about reporting harassment at VA. 

Then, *if the participant was using a computer and NOT a screen reader*, they were shown the poster (the PDF was screen-shared by the moderator, and the participant was given mouse control so they could scroll).

ALL participants were given the URL for the landing page on the Staging server and asked to interact with it on their device while sharing their screen.

After reviewing the landing page (and maybe the poster), research participants were asked whether they had any experiences with harassment at VA. 

## Harassment and participant safety (trauma-informed research)

Because harassment is a potentially triggering subject, we wanted to be careful about recruiting people to participate in this research. We wanted to have some Veterans who have experienced harassment at VA and are able to participate in research sessions without re-triggering the trauma that they've experienced. Our plans to help ensure participant safety included the following:
- Provided an overview of the session for Perigean personnel to read to potential participants and then ask if they are comfortable participating.
- Worked with VA contacts to find social workers or clinicians to observe the sessions with the Veterans and provide support if trauma-triggering occurs. 
- Limited the number of observers in the session to **one** team member (plus the moderator, a social worker, and a Perigean notetaker for a total of 4 people in the Zoom room with the participant). 
  - For each session with a participant using a screen reader, have an accessibility specialist as the observer to help with any technical issues.

# Hypotheses and Conclusions
1.  
    1. MOSTLY TRUE: 
1. 
    1. MAYBE TRUE:

2. Veterans will learn from the static landing page how to report harassment that happens at VA.
3. Veterans will understand what will happen when they report harassment at VA.

# Details of Findings 

## Feedback on the landing page
All 14 participants provided feedback on the landing page.
1. **Desired amount of content varies greatly among participants.** 

    2. More than half of the participants (8 of 14) said that the landing page had a lot of information and was straightforward and helpful. Three participants read the content closely, opening all the accordions, and appreciated all the details and the organization. One participant asked if it's going to be launched soon because they want the information on how to report harassment at VA.
    4. Five participants skimmed through the headings but not the top paragraph or the details below. One said that they would read more details if they wanted to report harassment.
    5. 2 participants said that it was way too much information and they wouldn't take the time to look at it all. 
    6. One participant said they didn't know what will happen after they report; they must not have read the "What to expect after you file your report" section.
    
    > *"Likes that it gives a lot of information...ample amount of resources...communicates that this is something important to VA" (p4).*
    
    > *"Struggle to find the info needed amidst so much writing...I don't want to read a bunch of stuff...just want to find the link to call or fill out online" (p13).*
7. Three participants were **skeptical that the wording in the landing page reflects new change and policies at VA**. One participant thought that the landing page showed that VA is being more transparent about harassment than it has been in the past, but they were skeptical that anything was actually different. 

> *"A bit more transparent than VA has been in the past...Honestly, it feels like 'nice try'. This is cool, but we've kind of seen this stuff before. I've been getting this since I was in the service--classes about sexual harassment, and nothing changes" (p9).*

> *"Is this creating a product to cover their behind? I wonder about the resources offered...wait to assess until try it" (p4).*

> *"Can be written like this, but...does it actually happen that way?...I think it sounds great, but in reality, we can only hope that it's going to be followed" (p15).*
  - Veterans aren't necessarily going to pay attention to a new web page about harassment since there's been a long-standing culture around sexual harassment in the military and at VA. A new web page is only one part of a larger communication plan needed across all of VA and individual facilities. And it needs to speak to ALL Veterans, including women who have been repeatedly harassed at VA.
 

1. **Page layout gives the impression of a shorter page.** Two people--one using a screen reader and one not--stopped scrolling the page after the subway map steps because they interpreted the separating line just below that as indicating the bottom of the page.

3. **Hours for reporting by phone were too limited.** Half of the participants (7 of 14) were concerned about the limited hours for the harassment reporting phone number because the time of day when they finally summon enough courage to report harassment is unpredictable. They don't want to have to wait until the next morning or weekday. Also, the limited hours make it inconvenient for Veterans who work during the day to report in private after work. Some said they might call the Veterans Crisis Line because it's available 24x7 but doubted that they would be able to report harassment that way. One person wondered what message they would get if they tried calling the phone number to report after hours.

> *"I would hope for a 24-hour line...Sometimes this stuff happens at 3 am, or you remember it at 3 am, or you come to the conclusion that you should report it then...I experience delayed reaction when I have issues like that" (p12).*

> *"Hurry up and do it in the heat of the moment before you decide not to...VA complicates things" (p13).*

> *"Would discourage me from making a call" because it might be closed by the time I get home from my appointment" (p11).*

5. **Expected to be able to report online.** Four participants expected a link on the landing page to report online and were disappointed when they couldn't find one. They wanted to be able to write out what happened in private instead of having to talk to someone, and also not get stuck on hold on the phone. One participant said that they would text VCL if they didn't want to talk to someone.
> *"Sometimes you're on hold forever...I don't want to call the VA again...also if you're not comfortable talking about it" (p8).*

1. There was **confusion about what happens after you report harassment**. Some participants didn't read the "What to expect after you file your report" section, and others spoke based on their own past experiences with reporting harassment at VA. Here some of the responses:
  - Want a followup to know the steps taken and their resolution, especially if the harassment was worse than a catcall (5 participants) 
  - Nothing would happen after reporting and don't expect followup, although they would like to have it (2)
  - VA might send a letter to the perpetrator but this won't do anything for a civilian or a Veteran. The person who reports won't get any details due to privacy. Something might happen if if were a VA employee because they might get reprimanded and could lose their job if they don't change their behavior 
  - Expects to hear a timeline for the followup
  - Wonders how quickly they would hear back, and worried about how many other cases need to be followed up on "within 1 business day" (in subway step 1). If it takes more than a week, they'd have to re-live it again when asked what the perpetrator was wearing, etc. 
  - Hopes that the perpetrator is reprimanded immediately and told that harassment isn't tolerated
  - Assumes that the patient advocate would look for the person and get their side of the story


> *Hoping for an immediate response or within an hour "while everything is still fresh in my mind" rather than "go into a black hole and who knows when I might get a response" (p5).*
 
  > *"I have been doing VA claims for MST and PTSD--extremely frustrating. I don't have a lot of confidence in their care and support" (p7).*

  > *"When I did report it [to a patient advocate], nothing was done about it...'We'll get back to you', and then they disappear into the VA system, never to be seen or heard from again...Supposedly there was going to be an investigation, then nothing (p9)".*
  - 

7. **What participants *liked* about the landing page:**
The following is a list of what participants mentioned liking about the landing page, with the number of participants who said this in parentheses if more than one:
    1. Definition of harassment and examples, including verbal comments so you know when you should report it (3 participants)
    1. Alert box at top with phone numbers (3)
    1. Organization with jump links at top and dropdowns for more information (3)
    1. List of questions at the bottom (2)
    1. Hyperlinks for phone numbers to call or text because they stand out visually and easy to use from a phone (2)
    1. Important that a visitor can report harassment--not just Veterans (2)
    6. The opening paragraph
    > *"First paragraph is very sympathetic...It makes you feel as through the VA is taking harassment very seriously" (p15).*
    7. Red VCL button
    1. "What to expect when you file your report" section
    1. Subway steps in "What to expect after you file your report" 
    1. "How to report harassment" section
    1. "Information we’ll ask you to share" section
    1. Good that you can report in any of these locations (in the "Report harassment in person" section)
    
7. **What participants *didn't like* about the landing page:**

    8. The opening paragraph 
    9. Don't need the definition of harassment
    10. Important information is too hidden--about if you're not comfortable giving your name (you have to click on it to read it) 
    11. Confusing to see the 800 reporting number with hours and the 24x7 VCL number. VCL is for suicide reports and won't be able to help me with harassment reporting.
    12. "How to quickly get the help you need" is smaller font than the text above it
    13. The header "Report harassment as a Veteran or visitor to VA" doesn't attract my attention
    14. Some language is too strong and overpromises:
      - "Stop the harassment" (under subway step 2 in "What to expect after you file your report") erodes trust when harassment happens again. Better to say that we can't stop it but can curtail it.
      - "Corrective action happens right away". Better to say "corrective action will be taken" (don't say that it will happen right away).
    17. Some langauge has too condescending of a tone:
    - "Harassment is any unwanted behavior that creates a hostile space"--Better to be supportive without being condescending: "Harassment can happen to anyone, and it's not your fault".
    - "Read this page to learn how..." Better: "Below you will find how to report harassment and what to expect..."
    1. "Corrective action" sounds like it refers only to VA employees. 	
> *"This seems to be directed towards employees of the VA because it says that they will take the appropriate action. I am not sure how they can make someone come back to receive punishment if they are not an employee and walk out the door" (p12).*
  
9. **What participants thought was *missing* on the landing page and should be added:**

    12. Examples that are and aren't considered harassment so know what to report and what not to report (2 participants)
    11. More information on sexual harassment and how it's different from harassment and assault
    12. Reassurance that it's OK to submit a report if you don't know the person's name--add this near "name or a description of the person".
    > Could say that the report is "Still taken seriously. Please still report even if you don't have the name of the person. Any description you can give would be beneficial" (p11).
    14. That you can discuss harassment with your primary care provider or therapist because you're comfortable with them and trust them
    15. Offer a chaplain as a resource (suggested by a military chaplain who has been helpful in helping deal with shame)
   
11. **Questions about content on the landing page:**

    8. What if the person doing the harassing is a visitor to VA instead of an employee? Is that covered here? Not finding it in the questions at the end.
    9. Can you report in-person at a different location from where the harassment occurred? Or must it be the one where the harassment occurred?
    10. If I'm a man, can I request that I report with a woman? Or is that option only for women?
    11. Why is discrimination at very end of the page separate? It should be integrated into the "What harassment is" section.
    12. What is meant by "VA police"? Is it the onsite security guards?
    13. Who will be taking harassment reports and how will they be trained? *"Who are the people taking harassment reports? Veterans? Contractors? VA employees? Medical professionals? Someone with expertise? Someone who could reassure me that some action would be taken and in what timeframe?" (p5).*

    3. Re "What harassment is and when to report it": Thought it would be tell me when to submit a report--do it now or wait until I get home? Do I have a limited amount of time?
    4. How do you contact VA police? Is there a phone number to call, or do you flag them down? If so, where are they? Every location would have a different phone number and location.
    5. Why would you go to a cemetery to file a report?
    6. Re "Get phone numbers for VA national cemetery district offices": *"Do many people get harassed in cemeteries?" (p12).* A different participant mentioned that some people get harassed by Veteran funerals.
    7. How will I be contacted after the inquiry is complete? Email? Phone?

## Feedback on the poster
11 of 14 participants provided feedback on the poster; 3 participants didn't because they were using a smartphone or a screen reader.
1. **Mixed feedback overall**. 

- 7 participants thought all the information needed to report harassment. One said that they want to see more of these at VA, especially in bathroom stalls.
- 4 people thought it was too wordy. 
- 2 people thought it wasn't new information. 
- 2 people said they'd take a picture with their phone so they could read it later. One of them said they wouldn't take the time to read it in a high-traffic area because they might be judged by others.
> *"Thorough, a lot of information. Would take a picture with my phone" (p7).*
> 
> *"Not going to read all that!" (p6).*
> 
> *"Good lord, too busy! Imagine looking at in an elevator--not enough time to read the whole thing" (p8).*
> 
> *"Just one more announcement--not that different from what I've seen" (p9).*

3. **The poster looked familiar.** One participant reported seeing a poster with similar messages in a VA facility. (I obtained a copy from one of the social worker observers, which is included in the appendix. This poster has many fewer words so easy to scan, and also a QR code for more information.) Another participant said they've seen sexual harassment messages like this in every bathroom and doorway while in the military.

5. **What participants *liked* about the poster:**
    1. Very clear with phone number to call
    > *"That's new. Don't have much hope, but would try it" (p9).*
    1. "What harassment is and when to report it" section
    2. Suggestion of a security guard because you might want someone in uniform to help
    3. Information that's in bold and larger font because you look at it right away

7. **What participants *didn't like* about the poster:**
    1. Not helpful to explain what harassment is because it seems condescending (2 participants)
    2. What you should what you should do (e.g., number to call) doesn't stand out. You need a simple message immediately if you're upset, traumatized, upset, and/or mad.
    3. Confusing to see 911 or VA police at the top because didn't see at first that it's for sexual assault or immediate harm.
   
9. **What participants thought was *missing* on the poster and should be added:**
    1. A QR code to get more information
    1. That you can discuss harassment with your primary care provider or therapist because you're comfortable with them and trust them
    

11. **Questions about content on the landing page:**
    1. Who can I report? A VA employee or Veteran/visitor/patient?
    1. What is "the VA police"? The security guards onsite?
    1. How do you contact the VA police? Is there a phone #? Do you just flag them down? If so, where are they? Every location would have a different phone number and location. One participant said they they know that you can find security at the front desk, and VA police roam around but have an office in back.

## Attitudes around harassment and reporting
1. **Much harassment isn't reported for a variety of reasons.** Many participants said they wouldn't report harassment in the hypothetical situation discussed during the research session (on your way into a medical appointment, someone said something rude and made a sexual gesture that made you feel uncomfortable) or other times because of the following reasons:
  - Didn't seem serious/bad enough or physical, vs. only verbal (7 participants)
  - Just say something directly to the person and then try to forget about it (6)  
  - Common for women in all-male work environments; females in the military are taught to not say anything about what happens (4)
  - Wouldn't do any good if you don't know the name of the person (3)
  - Concerned about retaliation if report in person at the facility where it happened 
  - Fear of what it would do to the one who reports
  - Don't report VA people because you need something from them
  - Maybe I was just triggered by something else. Will talk it over with my therapist
  - Didn't know that you could report harassment that happens at VA

>  *“Tell the guy to f### himself. I would go report it to somebody. I’ve reported in the past and nothing was done so I would just go on with my day” (p9)*

>  *"It happens a lot...have gotten used to it as a female...boys being boys...takes pride to not complain" (p14).*

> *“Took me till 2019 [40 years] to share this [report MST after seeking treatment for PTSD]...“It’s a beautiful journey. I wrote the story” (p6).*

> *"We don't know who it is, so there's nothing we can do about it" (p9).*

> *If I call the 800 number now and tell them what happened a few weeks ago, what are they going to do? They can annotate what happened as far as statistics go. This happened so many times in this particular facility. Really they can't do anything to reprimand anybody" if they don't know their name (p3).*

1. Participants said that they consider a number of **factors when deciding whether to report harassment**, including the following:
  - How mad I got 
  - Who did it and their age (i.e., homeless, older, VA employee)--would report if it was an employee because it could be repeated with others
  - Who the person is and their age (i.e., homeless, older)
  - Whether it happened repeatedly--would report if it did
  - How rude it was, and whether it's worth the energy to try to get justice (2)

> *"If it was a major offense--extraordinarily insulting because it takes energy to report" (p4).*

1. Participants said they'd **decide HOW to report harassment based on their current location (i.e., report in person if they're at a VA site vs. report by phone if they're at home), their own preferences, and their past experiences**. Many said they'd try one method, and if it wasn't helpful, they would try a different way. 

> *"Did you take my account seriously? If not, I will try the next resource...Don't want a single point of failure" (p4).*

  - **In-person with a patient advocate was the most popular way to report.** 9 of 14 participants said that they would report harassment to the patient advocate at the facility. It is unclear whether this is because of the content in the landing page and poster, the current VA anti-harassment poster in some facilities, and/or past experiences.  Participants expected that if the patient advocate wasn't the right person, they would get you to the right person (e.g., the VA police). (Do patient advocates currently do this?) Veterans shared about the frustrations they've had in trying to get issues at VA resolved and how they're often passed off from person to person, especially over the phone. We need the process of reporting harassment to be less of a burden so people will actually do it. Some participants said that they wouldn't report harassment to a VA-contracted medical provider or building security staff because of bad experiences they've had with them.
> *"Best place...to get someone with authority. They get you to the right person...Have used patient advocates before in person and over the phone with mixed results" (p13).*

  - Participants had different **reasons for wanting to report in person**:
    1. So the person you're talking to can see the anger/frustration in your face (2 participants)
    2. So you have a person's name who you can go back to if you have more information
    3. So it's more likely that the person bothering you is still there
    4. If you need help right then (e.g., someone is following you or yelling at you), go directly to the security desk or find VA police
    5. I can talk better over the phone because I can focus
    6. I can trust my primary care provider or therapist
 
 - SUMMARIZE "PREFS FOR HOW TO REPORT" DATA IN SEP. SPREADSHEET TAB to see proportion of in person vs. phone vs. other--mk a table
    - before showing resources
    - after seeing poster
    - after seeing landing page
    - going forward
    
    One female participant said they would call Women's Veterans Call Center because they would feel more comfortable and safe talking with another woman about this.
    
  - Two participants said that they wanted to be able to **report anonymously for safety or privacy reasons**. A third participant at first didn't see the "What if I’m not comfortable giving my name with my report?" accordion and so thought you couldn't report anonymously. Then they saw it and thought it sounded too complicated because the OIG sounds like a different organization.

  > *Reporting anonymously "sounds like more of a convoluted process, though, because leaving the VA and going into a whole other organization" (p8).
  
  > *"I very rarely go to the VA and don't run into somebody that I know...As a woman, it's hard for me to complain about anything...the military is a male-dominated thing, even more so in the Marines...If I'm going to report something, it would have to be pretty substantial, and I wouldn't want my name getting out there, my reputation destroyed because I've seen that happen before where someone comes forth to express being uncomfortable, and then it gets blown out of proportion, and the victim ends up turning into the criminal very quickly." (p14).*

  > *"If sexually assaulted, I would want everyone to know. If catcalling, I would report anonymously because I'm afraid of what others would say. Should handle it myself...putting pressure on myself because I overthink it from my perspective and the other person's. How bad did it make me feel--harmless or psychologically damaging? Want to make the right decision to move forward. Report if something substantial because it takes resources and multiple people involved. "Have I felt victimized enough to complain about it?" (p14).*


## Broader VA context
In this research, we tested the landing page and poster and got user feedback on the content and the reporting processes described. We can't fix all of the issues described above without understanding and potentially revising the VA reporting processes and policies. In this section are some issues and observations about the broader VA context.

7. **Harassment reporting resources met with varying degrees of skepticism.** Some Veterans appreciated these efforts by VA to acknowledge that harassment exists and finally trying to do something about it, while others said they're skeptical because of their many experiences to the contrary at VA and in the military. They don't think anything will change at VA and want to see evidence of systemic change in addition to a new poster and web page.

> *“Harassment happens so frequently [at the VA that] it’s a surprise when it doesn’t happen” (p9).*
 
> *“For years, no one wanted to admit this type of behavior was going on” (p6).*

> *"I used to have some hope that it would be different, but no longer. With the VA, I don't expect anything because you'll only be disappointed" (p9).* 

1. **Seeing a new web page and poster aren't enough to convince Veterans that harassment at VA is being addressed.** Would need to see new policies and different behaviors by VA employees as evidence of change. 

> *"This would get my interest: "Sexual harassment or lunchtime events or womens' stuff, a separate entrance for women. Actions that she could feel happen--not just a web page...Tell me what's being done...What best practices and standard operating procedures are you going to be going under when this happens? What have you done to change to show me that it's not going to continue like that? Tell me you're hiring X number of MST coordinators, or you're putting more time into better therapy for MST, or you're going to require the men on base have some kind of class on it. If a guy is found to have done it, he's no longer welcome at that VA anymore, because when people get in trouble for that kind of stuff, they're still allowed to come back to the VA, and it's just a problem waiting to happen" (p9).*

1. **Harassment is pervasive at VA and in the military, especially directed towards women.**

> *"There is such a core belief in the military about sexual harassment and what it is and what it means to do it...I got out in '96 and avoided the VA for 17 years because I couldn't stand the harassment...better now because they recognize that harassment does exist...it can be said, 'you can't do that to me, you need to stop'...When I got out, it was 'don't make a scene, don't say anything, you're going to get in trouble'...One VA in California--I think it's Palo Alto--any woman Veteran who has used them loves them...they have a separate entrance, you get assigned case managers for things, and very pro-women. Unfortunately the one I'm at isn't like that. I don't understand why that's not the standard at every VA hospital because if it's such a priority, you'd make it a priority to treat us better...That plays into the abuse we get. We aren't treated with respect, so why should anybody else have to be treating us with respect...If the core institution is so all over the place with it, why is anyone else going to stop and be respectful?...The VA and the military both need to do some reckoning with how they serve women and how they treat assaults...You've got somebody who lived in that for 4 years--a guy or a girl--and they come out and go right into a similar situation. It almost seems indoctrinated into them" (p9).*

9. **Four participants shared stories of harassment by VA employees or the VA facility in general.** Some research participants shared their own stories of harassment at VA, and especially disturbing are those where the perpetrator is a VA employee. This is a serious issue that needs to be addressed by the VA, and one that revising the landing page and poster isn't going to fix. Below is a summary of these stories.


    1. p14 was once asked by a **VA employee** for her disability rating, and she said "100%". The VA employee then laughed and said, "who'd you have to do to get that?" 
    1. p7 requested a female provider but didn't get one. She didn't feel comfortable with the **male VA provider** she saw--she didn't feel seen, didn't feel heard, and he wasn't addressing the root issues. He prescribed medication, which she didn't want. She asked for a different provider, for which she had to fill out a form. After that, the male provider called her and was defensive and berated her about not feeling comfortable with him. It took years for her to get a female provider, and now she's making progress without medication.	
    2. While p9 was in a 2-month residential PTSD program, the **VA program director** did something bad (not named). She almost committed suicide because of it. She told the patient advocate what happened, and the advocate didn't report it she said that p9 had to do it herself. It took p9 a while to get better, and when she was, she no longer felt like reporting it and so never did. 

> *"It requires a lot of extra effort to bring things to people's attention, and I didn't have the mental wherewithall to do it at the time" (p9).*	

 3. For her retirement, p4's VA packet said to talk with a provider about your ailments. She saw a **VA-contracted provider** twice who heard about her MST and said, "I don't know what this is", and countered her story with "maybe you're misperceiving this." The provider must have had no training in MST and being trauma-informed. He didn't make her feel at ease and heard--no empathy or compassion.	

    1. p9 is a breast cancer survivor, and there are no women doctors at her VAMC to take care of her (**VAMC/clinic staffing**).
    2. p9 once showed up for her gynecological exam, and was told that they had no gown for her to wear (**VA clinic supplies**). 
    
    > *“Stuff like that feels really humiliating" (p9).*


1. **Four participants shared stories of harassment by other Veterans or visitors to VA.** Below is a summary of their stories.
    1. p7 is a female Veteran who is asked by older **male Veterans**, "Are you here waiting for your husband?" She says, "No, I'm the Veteran". They don't understand that there are women Veterans.
    1. p3 was harassed by an older couple in the waiting room waiting to be seen. The woman asked, "Are you 100%?" He said "Yes", and she said, “Well, we're only at 80%. We've been trying to get 100% for years, and they still won't bump us...You don't look like you're 100%, you don't look like you're completely disabled...you look fine to me”. "She kept harassing me about the way I looked physically and the way that her husband looked that I shouldn't be 100% but more like 50%. That really pi&&ed me off, but I just kind of brushed it off and ignored them. I didn't really think much of it until now." p3 sensed their frustration with VA and brushed it off. He realized during the research session that this was actually harassment, and someone else with PTSD could have been triggered by that. Asking someone their disability rating is like asking what they get paid. **Veteran's spouse or Veteran**
    1. In a VA pharmacy, a guy's phone was blasting music loudly, and p9 couldn't hear what the pharmacist was saying because she's deaf in one ear. She asked the person nicely to please turn down the music, and he yelled profanity at her and wouldn't do it. She went to a cop for help, and the cop asked, "What do you want me to do about it?" and didn't do anything. The cop grilled her as to why she went to them, and she felt like a victim. He said he couldn't remove him from the building, and wouldn't stay there with her. p9 reported this, but never heard nothing back.	**unknown person**
    1. p8 is non-binary and has been told in a VA site that they're in the wrong bathroom. They try looking for a single unisex bathroom. **unknown person**

1. **Veterans' experiences interacting with the VA differ tremendously** 
- One participant said that she's had wonderful experiences at her VA site, but she knows from Veteran groups on Facebook that more harassment happens at other sites.
- A non-binary participant said that some of their VA clinics have become more welcoming of LGTBQ+ Veterans in the last few years, with posters about Pride month and LGBTQ+ Veterans, and having a separate Women's Clinic.
- A female participant said that VA missed an opportunity to do something nice for women. Her picture was featured in the [I am not invisible](https://www.va.gov/womenvet/iani/index.asp) campaign at her VAMC, but nobody told her that she was being recognized for this. They just hung up the picture, and a friend of hers saw it and told her. 

> *“That would have been a perfect opportunity for them to do something to recognize women, but they ruined it” (p9).*

- Another participant talked about his frustration trying to reach VA on the phone, getting repeatedly transferred to different departments and people or disconnected without resolving his problem. And when talking to someone in person, they sometimes accuse you of being hostile.

> *"If you get too loud or anything at the VA nowadays, they want to punch out that stress card and talk about how you're the one needing to calm down...they take frustration and loud voice as a threat...when you're trying to bust through the frustration of being handed off to 4 different offices over the phone, and you finally get maybe the right office, and you're trying to voice that something ain't right...and then someone says, 'hey, you need to calm down, you sound kinda hostile'...not having the right person in front of you who doesn't know how to deal with someone in crisis. Maybe it's a volunteer that doesn't have the right training" (p13).*

> *"Getting the services sometimes is frustrating...Everybody knows it's not going to change fast..You just go through the process and deal with it...Why are you making it difficult for me to get what I need?...so hard that people give up on it..." (p13).*


## Feedback on the trauma-informed research methods
Below are a few findings that relate to the traum-informed research methods we used. 
1. 


# Recommendations

## What we can address with technology/content alone

1. The landing page and poster need to **better serve the entire range of audiences who want to read the details *vs.* only the headers *vs.* just the phone number/link to report** by providing the most critical details up front with optional access to more information lower down and/or accessible via links (progressive disclosure). Assuming that the purpose of this page is to explain how to report harassment (and not a hub for all information about harassment), some specific content suggestions are below:

    1. Have an eye-catching short title that's a call to action (e.g., from the current VA anti-harassment poster: "If you are harassed or sexually assaulted" in big bold letters).
    2. Just below the title, have the phone number/person/link to report (landing page and poster) and links to what you do when you report and what VA will do (landing page only) or a QR code for more information (poster only).
    4. (landing page only) Add details on what is/not harassment, especially verbal comments, along with messaging about if you feel uncomfortable, there's no need to satisfy specific rules or definitions of harassment. Ideally hide such details under links/accordions to avoid triggering.
    5. (poster only) Minimize the number of words so it's easy to scan and understand in a short amount of time. Consider deleting the "What harassment is and when to report it" section at the bottom.

1. We need to get people more comfortable with reporting harassment. **Providing an online form to report harassment** would help and is expected by many Veterans.

1. Consider **making the anonymous reporting option more clear** by adding the accordion on the same line as "Your name and contact information" under "Information we'll ask you to share", and also describing it in a more conversational tone.

1. Revisit the audience of these harassment reporting materials:
    1. **Victims of harassment and witnesses of harassment**--Highlight the importance of reporting harassment that you winess because that can help reduce the burden to report on the victims of harassment.
    2. **All genders including women and non-binary** folks--With the current gender-neutral language, some women may feel unseen as targets of harassment. Consider acknowledging women specifically by using the word "women" in some places in the materials.


## We need to talk about VA processes and services 

1. **Simplify the harassment reporting process to reduce the burden on the person reporting** because they may be distraught and not know whether what happened is assault, sexual assault, or harassment. Give them simple options for reporting so they don't have to try multiple options when they're upset. 
 
    3. The people who receive harassment reporting calls or in-person reports need trauma-informed training in what to do and how to support people who are reporting harassment. This includes VA providers and VA-contracted providers, who also might receive harassment reports.

    1. To report harassment by phone, **there needs to be one phone number that you can call ANYTIME day or night** so you don't have to choose from multiple numbers. We need to focus on the user experience of the person gathering up the courage to report. The current phone number with limited hours and days will lead to fewer harassment reports and also likely erodes trust in VA. If there are some hours/days that the phone number isn't answered, there needs to be a message on it that tells callers how to report harassment in another way.

3. The new web page and poster on harassment reporting is only one part of a larger communication plan needed across all of VA and individual facilities that needs to speak to ALL Veterans, including women who have been repeatedly harassed at VA, about what systemic changes are happening. 
    1. Don't promise that you're fixing the world but say what you're trying to do. We shouldn't oversell how fast VA can change.
    2. One research participant suggested handing out a little card that has the the harassment reporting phone numbers, just like is currently done with VCL.

5. VA has to **prove by *action* that that they'll do something useful with harassment reports**. It's not enough to say on a web page that VA will do something. Look at VA sites with a lot of harassment reports and see how they're run. Perhaps their leaders and employees need more training on recognizing and handling harassment onsite.

### Screenshot of a different VA poster that's now in VA facilities
This poster is currently being posted in VA facilities. This copy was shared by one of the social worker observers. Note that the poster has many fewer words so it's easy to quickly scan, and has a QR code for more information.

### Screenshot of the web page reached from the QR code in the above poster 
The QR code in the poster above leads to the following web page for the VHA Assault and Harassment Prevention Office. It contains information including a spedometer-type gauge of behavior that goes from Acceptable to Sexual Violence/Assault, which doesn't seem helpful and might actually be harmful.
