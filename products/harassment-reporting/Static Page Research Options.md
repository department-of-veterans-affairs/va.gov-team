# HRT Static Page Research Options 

<details><summary>Baseline Details</summary>
Meeting notes: Discussed moving forward with HRT static landing page initiative (Already passed staging review, 98% complete and was just pending Contact details) research to determine Veteran expectations on HRT landing page prior to launch.

## Research Options 1 (Typical Study Approach 2x weeks (1W Recrutiment, 1W Research) 
Scope: Work would beging in January 3, 2021 (Begin scoping work, finalize research plan and kickstart recruitment) based on Cindy's programmed PTO.  Cindy could likely complete a research plan the week of 12/13-17 prior to heading OOO on leave and have available for presentations/convos in support.

Risks | Tradeoff: Would be a trade off from O&E research topline summary but could be completed prior to leaving on PTO. 

Value: Would allow for review of research plan during "code freeze" times, and would be the most logical and optimal time to conduct research based on availability of required attendees such as clinicians/social workers, etc. 

## Research Options 2 (Hall-Way Research Study)
Scope: Possible hall-way study could be conducted with program Veterans (Internal to contract team) during the week of 12/13-17 but is dependent on desired outcomes of the study and goals.  Would allow for review with 4-5 Veterans to gain prosective on HRT Static Landing Page. Note: Cindy could likely complete a research plan the week of 12/13-17 prior to heading OOO on leave and have available for presentations/convos in support.

Risks | Tradeoff: Would be a trade off from O&E research topline summary but could be completed prior to leaving on PTO. 

Value: Would allow for quick prospective from Veterans (contractors) but wouldn't be a random sampling of Veterans as they might have prior knowledge and understanding of the HRT problem space. 

## Research Options 3 (Heuristic Research Study)
Scope: Posibility to conduct a heuristic research study internally with Cindy and Brian L. (Veteran) to provide prospective based on timeline and needs of timely research requirements.

Risks | Tradeoff: Would be a trade off from O&E research topline summary but could be completed prior to leaving on PTO. 

Value: Would allow for quick prospective from internal prospectives and provide a Veteran review.  It would also minimize the time requirment needed and could likely be completed in 1-2 days during the week of December 13-17, 2021.  

## Options Not-Feasible 
- Bringing in other Researchers.  Both available researchers are actively working research projects and both have programmed leave. 
- Design Research Substitute- not recommended based on level (would need spin up time for problem set baselining) and challenges of the research needed for this type of study.
