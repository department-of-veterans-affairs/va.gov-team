## Office of Resolution Management, Diversity & Inclusion (ORMDI): Harassment Prevention
Summary: The Office of Resolution Management, Diversity and Inclusion (ORDMI) is the office in-charge VA Wide for processing complaints from Veterans and Employees for alleged Civil Rights Violations as well as for Harassment, Reasonable Accommodations, and other inappropriate behaviors while on a VA Site.

In response to Section 5303 of the Deborah Sampson Act which is part of the Megabus Bill that was passed in January, and new congressional demands for action, a team of Presidential Innovation Fellows (PIFs) is scoping the feasibility of creating a secure, online reporting tool on VA.gov that would enable Veterans and VA employees to report alleged incidents about violations from Veterans and VA employees which occur while on a VA Site.


### Public Websites Team: What do we need to know? 

<details><summary>General / Programatics</summary>

- What is being asked of the VA.gov team for this effort?
  - Access to dev environment to build the front-end experience
  - Some resources to collaborate on the front-end 
    - Light collaboration on the Dev side with Joshua for landing page and webform as required; advice/help finding SMEs as needed with data storage location for webform data
    - Research/Testing 
      -  Navigation and Design for Home/Main pages ->landing page->to log-in-> to web form
      -  Web Form Design and Flow 
    - On Product side -  minimize to what you feel is required given scope (I can help chase things down on my side)
      - Definitely need help getting the Administrations to change their main page and VA.GOV Home page to fit navigation recommendation so we have some uniformity

- Timeline for implementation
  - As far as timing, Leadership is hoping to launch MVP1 no later than September 2021.  As we have all said, the long pole here is the backend.

- What is the scope of MVP1?
  - VA.gov Public Websites Team will commit to the following:
    - Research/Cindy
       - Landscape/competitive research (e.g. how other federal agencies position this as a Web resource and tool -- e.g. https://www.safehelpline.org/) Note: ORDMI PIFs have compiled upfront info.
       - Veteran and employee user testing research of (a) Web experience -- e.g. where is the link at VA.gov? What content and resources are available? and (b) Web Form experience (including questions and after-submission) 
    - Design - build of InDesign prototype(s) for user testing

- Does a list of form questions exists?  Could we review (size and scope)
  - A code prototype created by Joshua Farrar, PIF detailed at ORDMI, is available as a Pull Request attached to the `vets-website` project.  This prototype speaks specifically to the harassment case, and would simply need relatively straightforward modifications. 
  
- Can we get linked to applicable Governance / Laws driving this initiative?
  - Section 5303 of the Deborah Sampson Act (P.L. 116-315), requires VA to implement a comprehensive anti-harassment and anti-sexual assault policy. In 2018, the VA found that one in four women veterans and VA employees reported experiencing sexual harassment or assault at the VA, and a 2020 GAO report identified “inconsistent and incomplete” workplace sexual harassment policies at the VA. While there are policies and reporting mechanisms in place for VA employees reporting sexual harassment from other employees,
there were no comparable policies, centralized reporting mechanisms, or resources for VA beneficiaries who are sexually harassed or assaulted by VA employees or on VA property. 

- Who will provide content? 
  - ORDMI
  
- What's the current reporting process for Veterans?
  - 
- Are we keeping the Veteran reporting form separate from that of the Employee reporting form?
  - 
- Should this be modeled after existing reporting tools offered by the Military Service Branches i.e. Army SHARP program? 
  -
- Marketing Initiative in support of form launch?  Where and what are is the expected site/form traffic load to consider?

<details><summary>Technical Questions</summary>



- What program is the E2(Squared) program?  How do we tie in from a technical prospective?
- Where do submissions go to in the E2 database? New section?  
- Does Form copy (to Veterans) and submission success email need to be part of the form workflow? 
- Do we have a webmail service for forms? (Where should this link to?)  
- Do we want to verify who is putting in these requests?  I.e. PPI needed to submitt request and tie back to Veterans. 
- Location and Webpage (VA.gov) and approvals needed.  Will this be evergreen content?  
</details>


<details><summary>Research Questions</summary>
  
  
  
- Who has Perdita's team talked to and what did they learn? 
  - People who currently handle harassment complaints? (e.g., VA HR, mental health counselors, call center representatives)
  - People who have made harassment complaints?
  - People who counsel people have been affected by harassment? 
- Can you share the conceptual service blueprint that you've done? 
  - Is it [03_11_2021 Propsed TO BE Service Experience Design (draft).pdf](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/files/6511063/03_11_2021.Propsed.TO.BE.Service.Experience.Design.draft.pdf)? If so, could you walk us through it?
- Can you share the form prototype that Josh put together?
- What do you already know about the Veteran experience around harassment (besides reporting being either face-to-face or by phone)? Pain points? Successes?
- What suggestions do you have for a landscape analysis? (i.e., large health care systems, government agencies)
  - HHS? DoD/Armed services?
  - DMV (state government)?
  - Kaiser? Providence? Legacy?
</details>



<details><summary>Design Questions</summary>
 

- What are the current pain points if any?
- Are users submitting on mobile or desktop?
- I'd like to see the coneptual blue print and Josh's form prototype
- Do you have examples of harassment forms where you like the UX?
- I'd like to understand the end to end process of submitting harassment reports for Veterans.
