# Product Outline: Online Harassment Reporting Page & Form

## Overview

A 2020 Government Accountability Office report showed the VAâ€™s workplace sexual harassment policies were inconsistent and incomplete, including a lack of centralized reporting mechanisms or resources for VA beneficiaries who report sexual harrassment or assault by VA employees or on VA property.

The Office of Resolution Management, Diversity and Inclusion (ORDMI) is responsible for processing complaints from Veterans and employees for alleged civil rights violations, harassment, reasonable accommodations, and other inappropriate behaviors experienced while on a VA site.

In response to Section 5303 of the Deborah Sampson Act (part of the Megabus Bill that was passed in January 2021) and new congressional demands for action, ORDMI has been charged with building a secure, online reporting tool on VA.gov that would enable reporting of alleged incidents which occur in a VA facility.

Currently, Veterans report incidents by phone or in-person at VA facility. 

## Problem Statement

How might we make it easier for Veterans to report incidents of harassment or assault by VA employees or occur on a VA property?
How might we create a secure, easy-to-use digital (web and mobile) tool for self-reporting of incidents that occur at VA facilities?
- e.g., sexual assault, harassment, RA, Veterans civil rights, EEO, other incivility Events -- bullying, micro-aggressions
- 
## Desired User / Business Outcomes

**User goals**
- As a Veteran or VA employee, I want to report an incident in a way that allows for more privacy and anonymity (online vs. in-person), is guided (e.g. the form requires needed information, reducing risk of error) and will increase speed to outcome (e.g. the data will be routed to the correct remediation path).
- As a Veteran or VA employee, I want to track the progress of my report so that I can confirm it has been routed to the correct remediation path and is being taken seriously.

**With this problem solved, what should users be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?**
- There is the possibilty that a "track progress" of report will be a key feature, once systems are in place. 

**Why would your business want this to exist?**
- VA ORDMI has been charged with creating a centralized reporting mechanism and driving awareness about this resource in response to potential increase in reported incidents and perception that VA has not been responsive and transparent about the issue.
- To create an administration component of the digital tool to enable processing, tracking and reporting of incidents that are self-reported via the tool.
- To create a new federated Veterans Affairs system for Sexual Assault (e.g., System of Record (SoR) for Sexual Assaults that allows the import, enter, update, track, manage and report on all sexual assault events in the VA)
- To meet congressionally mandated requirements for Section 5303 by creating a centralized reporting mechanism for VA incidents of Sexual Assault and Harassment

## Undesired User / Business Outcomes
- An online reporting form that is confusing or difficult to complete.
- An online reporting form which does not collect more PPI than absolutely necessary and clearly outlines expectations for privacy and confidentiality.
- An online reporting form that is not secure.
- An online reporting form that does not enable efficient submission, routing, remediation -- or slows the process.
- An online reporting form that does not provide users with submission confirmation and confidence the issue is being actions for next steps.

## Assumptions

- Some Veterans will prefer -- for privacy reasons, due to efficiency, etc. -- to complete an online form for reporting incidents versus current means (e.g., in-person at VA facility, call VA, mail Office of Inspector General)
- The online form will need to accommodate privacy and confidentiality and explain when/why it cannot. 

**Organizational Viability Risks/Assumptions**
- Can ORMDI handle an influx of complaints to process (important to know: historic volume)
- Internal policies are in place to create necessary culture change

**Feasibility Risks/Assumptions** 
- Can existying intake system of complaints handle increased load due to a new VA.gov submission mechanism (in addition to the existing mechanisms)?
- What is the clear/existing definition of "secure"?

## Constraints

- The Integrated Project Team (IPT) was convened to evaluate the feasibility of using the existing system vs replacing the current system with a centralized case management system. Pending the outcome of those decisions, the team focused efforts on a static landing page and poster. 

## MVP Scope

Static landing page and poster validated in trauma-informed Veteran research sessions

For the MVP, the use case will be limited to Veterans reporting one of three types of events
  - harassment
  - sexual harassment
  - sexual assault

## Future iterations 
- Expand possible reporters
- Expand reportable incidents
  - anyone who wants to report a civil rights violation
  - anyone experiencing harassment, sexual harassment or sexual assault

## KPIs
  - Ratio of reports submitted online vs. in-person vs. mail vs. email vs. fax
  - Rate of successful submissions (e.g. all required information)
  - External: User satisfact with submissions (was able to complete task and recieve confirmation back concerning issue) 
  - Internal: Business lines have an effective tool to track submissions from users.
