# Product Outline: Online Harassment Reporting Page & Form

- Up to date [Product Epic is here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/24883).
- [Overview with additional context, references and artifacts](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/harassment-reporting) 

## Overview

The Office of Resolution Management, Diversity and Inclusion (ORDMI) is the office in-charge VA Wide for processing complaints from Veterans and Employees for alleged Civil Rights Violations as well as for Harassment, Reasonable Accommodations, and other inappropriate behaviors while on a VA Site.

In response to Section 5303 of the Deborah Sampson Act which is part of the Megabus Bill that was passed in January 2021, and new congressional demands for action, ORDMI has been charged with building a secure, online reporting tool on VA.gov that would enable Veterans (to start) and VA employees (later) to report alleged incidents about violations which occur in a VA facility.

(A 2020 Government Accountability Office report showed the VAâ€™s workplace sexual harassment policies were inconsistent and incomplete, including a lack of centralized reporting mechanisms or resources for VA beneficiaries who report sexual harrassment or assault by VA employees or on VA property.)


## Problem Statement

How might we make it easier for Veterans to report incidents of harassment or assault by VA employees or occur on a VA property?


## Assumptions

- Some Veterans will prefer -- for privacy reasons, due to efficiency, etc. -- to complete an online form for reporting incidents versus current means (e.g., in-person at VA facility, call VA, mail Office of Inspector General)
- The online form will be designed to accommodate various use cases for this delicate situation -- e.g. some may want to report an incident confidentially, etc.
- Organizational Viability Risks/Assumptions
Can ORMDI handle an influx of complaints to process (important to know: historic volume)
- Feasibility Risks/Assumptions: 
Can the intake system of complaints handle increased load due to a new VA.gov submission mechanism (in addition to the existing mechanisms)
What is the clear/existing definition of "secure" to follow (see Undesired User / Business Outcomes)


## MVP Scope

- For the MVP, the use case will be limited to Veterans reporting one of three types of events
  - harassment
  - sexual harassment
  - sexual assault

- For the future iteration, anyone (Veteran, family-member, employee) 
  - anyone who wants to report a civil rights violation
  - anyone experiencing harassment, sexual harassment or sexual assault.

## Desired User / Business Outcomes

**Why would a user want to use this?**
- To report an incident in a way that allows for more privacy and anonymity (online vs. in-person), is guided (e.g. the form requires needed information, reducing risk of error) and will increase speed to outcome (e.g. the data will be routed to the correct remediation path).


**With this problem solved, what should users be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?**
- There is the possibilty that a "track progress" of report will be a key feature, once systems are in place. 

**Why would your business want this to exist?**
- VA ORDMI has been charged with creating a centralized reporting mechanism and driving awareness about this resource in response to potential increase in reported incidents and perception that VA has not been responsive and transparent about the issue.

**With this problem solved, what should your business be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?**
- VA ORDMI should be able to more effectively capture, track and report on cases.

## Undesired User / Business Outcomes
- An online reporting form that is confusing, difficult to complete
- An online reporting form that is not secure
- An online reporting form that does not enable efficient submission, routing, remediation -- or slows the process.
- An online reporting form that does not provide users with submission confirmation and confidence the issue is being actions for next steps.

## KPIs
  - Ratio of reports submitted online vs. in-person vs. mail vs. email vs. fax
  - Rate of successful submissions (e.g. all required information)
  - External: User satisfact with submissions (was able to complete task and recieve confirmation back concerning issue) 
  - Internal: Business lines have an effective tool to track submissions from users.

## Solution Approach

- (1) Discovery research: How is this done elsewhere? How is this handled by VA now?  What are the pain points?
- (2) Prototype (including design and content): What would the reporting form contain? How will the questions be asked?  Will the form work for different use cases?
- (3) Context (content): Create resources to explain the reporting process and address the veteran's concerns, fears.
- (3) User Testing: Determine if: the form easy to use -- and it treats the user with empathy
- (4) Development: Build MVP of form for baseline functionality and processing integration and workflows
- (5) Deployment: Phased roll-out to test and, if necessary, iterate before going to full release
- (6) Awareness: Where will links go on VA.gov to ensure this is findable
