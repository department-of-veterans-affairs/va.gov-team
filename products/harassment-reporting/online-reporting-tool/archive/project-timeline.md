# Project Timeline - Harrassment Reporting Tool 

**NOTE: This project was paused in favor of a reporting static landing page and poster and may resume once current fragile database process has been replaced/improved**

### Project goals:

1. To create a secure, easy-to-use digital (Web & Mobile) tool for self-reporting of incidents (e.g., Sexual Assault, Harassment, RA, Veterans Civil Rights, EEO, other Incivility Events -- bullying, micro-aggressions) that occur at VA facilities.
2. To create an administration component of the digital tool to enable processing, tracking and reporting of incidents that are self-reported via the tool.
3. To create a new federated Veterans Affairs system for Sexual Assault (e.g., System of Record (SoR) for Sexual Assaults that allows the import, enter, update, track, manage and report on all sexual assault events in the VA)
4. To meet congressionally mandated requirements for Section 5303 by creating a centralized reporting mechanism for VA incidents of Sexual Assault and Harassment
