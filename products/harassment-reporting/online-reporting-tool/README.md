# Proposed: VA.gov Secure Online Harassment Reporting Tool

The Office of Resolution Management, Diversity and Inclusion (ORDMI) is the office in-charge VA Wide for processing complaints from Veterans and Employees for alleged Civil Rights Violations as well as for Harassment, Reasonable Accommodations, and other inappropriate behaviors **while on a VA Site.**

In response to Section 5303 of the Deborah Sampson Act which is part of the Megabus Bill that was passed in January, and [new congressional demands for action](https://healthitsecurity.com/news/va-health-records-protocols-probed-following-sexual-harassment-reports), a team of Presidential Innovation Fellows (PIFs) is scoping the feasibility of creating a secure, online reporting tool on VA.gov that would enable Veterans and VA employees to report alleged incidents about violations from Veterans and  VA employees which occur **while on a VA Site.**

## Headlines
**Business stakeholder -** The Office of Resolution Management, Diversity and Inclusion (ORDMI)

**DEPO owner**

To be determined.


**Is request tracked to an event or Congressional deadline? -** 

It may be.  Per a letter sent by a group of 50 Congressional members to VA Secretary Denis McDonough in April: “It is absolutely critical for VA to move forward with implementation of Section 5303, creating a centralized reporting mechanism for VA beneficiaries and to designate sexual harassment and assault prevention coordinators, so that veterans know where to turn when subjected to degrading treatment when accessing care and benefits.” 

## Details
**Who is the primary user?**
- Veterans who receive care at VA facilities **and** VA employees.

**What are the user goals for the project/page/product?**

The goals are:

- To create a secure, easy-to-use digital (Web & Mobile) tool for self-reporting of incidents (e.g., Sexual Assault, Harassment, RA, Veterans Civil Rights, EEO, other Incivility Events -- bullying, micro-aggressions) that occur at VA facilities.
- To create an administration component of the digital tool to enable processing, tracking and reporting of incidents that are self-reported via the tool.
- To create a new federated Veterans Affairs system for Sexual Assault (e.g., System of Record (SoR) for Sexual Assaults that allows the import, enter, update, track, manage and report on all sexual assault events in the VA)


**What is the business goal?**

- To meet congressionally mandated requirements for Section 5303 by creating a centralized reporting mechanism for VA incidents of Sexual Assault and Harassment

**How does this map to our North Star?**

- [X] Increase availability of self-service tools**
- [X] Decrease time to outcomes
- [ ] Maximize satisfaction, reliability, availability, & security

**How will we measure success?**
- TBD

**How well do we understand the problem?**
- It is NOT abundantly clear yet that (a) this solution (e.g. a new front-end tool and back-end system) is required by law; that VA.gov needs to be the front-door to this solution and (c) that the scope as defined by the Presidential Innovation Fellows is designed and sized in a way that is aligned with our OCTO-DE approach of delivering value in a truly agile (smaller chunks) way.

**What is DEPO's role in this work?**
- Per the Presidential Innovation Fellow leads for the tech initiative (Soni Meckem at Office of Resolution Management, Diversity & Inclusion):
   - Help Navigating any Privacy/ATO Administrative Processes that would be required
   - Dev Environments with Heavy Consult/Collab on Front End Build
   - Design (user testing) – I’m here to assist but need someone to take lead who knows internal processes
   - Consult on getting data from Front-End to a SharePoint Environment

(Note: Soni is the Program/Product lead and is partnered with Joshua Farrar an engineer at GSA.   They are assigned to this project through their terms in Sept. 2021 -- but may be extended for another year.)

**What are the known risks?**
- The ORDMI/PIF team responsible requires too much unplanned capacity/bandwidth from OCTO-DE (in particular Platform, etc.) to be successful.   NOTE: There is no known OCTO-DE/OIT budget for this initiative.
- There is no clear "responsible/accountable" PO or team to own this for OCTO-DE.
