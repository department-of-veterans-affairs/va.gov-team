# **Veteran Onboarding**

## **Verify Your Military Information**

### **Overview**

The Iterate, Innovate, and Run (IIR) team is leading an initiative to get users to apply for their first benefit more quickly. While the long term vision is to have a page that recommends the benefits users should apply to first, this specific product release is focused on getting users to verify their military information. Having users verify their military information is a crucial first step since all benefits are contingent on certain eligibility criteria. We don’t want to be recommending inaccurate benefits. 


### **Problem Statement(s)**

1. Users don’t know what to do when they get to va.gov and they want to do something valuable.

2. Users don’t know what benefits they should apply to first.

3. We can’t accurately tell users which benefits they should apply to first if they don’t have accurate military information.

How might we statement: How might we help Veterans get their first win (win=benefit) as quickly as possible on va.gov?


### **Desired User Outcomes**

1. Users are welcomed to va.gov and are guided on how to “get started”.

2. Users understand the connection between verifying their military info and faster access to benefits.

3. Users verify that their military information on va.gov is accurate.

4. Users take action to get their military information updated if it is inaccurate on va.gov.

5. Users have clear next steps of what to do after they verify their military info to maintain momentum in their benefits journey.


### **Undesired User Outcomes**

1. Users don’t understand the value of verifying their military information.

2. Users don’t verify their military information due to confusion or technical barriers.

3. Users don’t take action to get their military information updated if it is inaccurate on va.gov.

4. Users verify their information but don’t know what to do next.


### **Desired Business Outcomes**

1. We have an understanding of how accurate Military Information is for va.gov users.

2. We have a user flow that we can continue to leverage and iterate on for “onboarding”.


### **Undesired Business Outcomes**

1. We don’t know how accurate Military Information is for va.gov users.

2. We don’t have a design that we can build upon and use for more “onboarding” items.


### **Measuring Success**

#### **Diagnostic Metrics**

| Metric                                                        | Pre Launch | 30 Days Post Launch | 60 Days Post Launch | 90 Days Post Launch |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| Number of clicks on verify/review alert                       | N/A        |                     |                     |                     |
| Number of clicks on accurate military info                    | N/A        |                     |                     |                     |
| Number of clicks on inaccurate military info                  | N/A        |                     |                     |                     |

### **Launch Strategy**

1. While we plan to eventually launch a page that tells users which benefits they should apply to first based on their military information, this release is just focused on having users verify their military information. We plan to do a slow rollout with the new user flow behind a feature flag.


### **Launch Dates**
