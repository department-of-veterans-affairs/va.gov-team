### When the participant joins:

- Thanks for joining us today! My name is Raquel. It's very nice to meet you. Today we're going to talk about first time interactions with VA.gov. Our discussion will help the team determine if there are any accessibility concerns we need to address.


#### **Intro - 5 minutes**

As we begin there are a few things I would like to start off with:

- The purpose of this session is to gain understanding of how we can improve the product for those using assistive technology. Are you using assistive technology in this session? What assistive tech are you using? (If not using assistive tech end session)

* In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. We want to hear your opinions so we can improve the website and make it work better for everyone.

- This entire session will take no more than 90 min. I will keep an eye on the time and may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic so we don’t go over.

* The format of this session is that we will talk together in the beginning, and then we will move to a part where you review a prototype that is not released publicly. We will ask that you share your screen as you interact with the prototype and if there’s anything that doesn’t work the way you expect.

- Finally, is it ok if I record the screen and the audio during our session today? Our team will use this as backup in case we need to refer to to make sure our notes are accurate. The recordings will be destroyed after we do this.

#### **Section 1: Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes**

1. What type of device will you use for this test?

Great, thanks for letting us know!
