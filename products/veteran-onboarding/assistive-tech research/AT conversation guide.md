## When the participant joins:

Validate that the participant uses AT and get permission for observers to join.

- Thanks for joining us today! My name is Raquel. It's very nice to meet you. Today we're going to talk about first time interactions with VA.gov. Our discussion will help the team understand how to improve the website for Veterans in the future.

* Before we begin: I have a few people on the team who are interested in listening to our session as observers. They’re in the virtual waiting room right now. It’s completely fine if you choose to have the session without observers, so let me know what you’d prefer. If it’s okay with you, I will have them join.

  - \[_If no] Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom._

  - \[_If yes] Admit observers. (If the participant agrees, let observers join. Each observer should come off mute and introduce themselves, and then go back on mute with video off.)_


### **Intro - 5 minutes**

As we begin there are a few things I would like to start off with:

- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. We want to hear your opinions so we can improve the website and make it work better for everyone.

* There are no expectations for you to provide any personal information. Please feel free to share your thoughts and experiences at the level that is comfortable for you.

- This entire session will take no more than 90 min. I will keep an eye on the time and may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic so we don’t go over.

* The format of this session is that we will talk together in the beginning, and then we will move to a part where you review a prototype that is not released publically today. We will ask that you share your screen as you interact with the prototype and if there’s anything that doesn’t work the way you expect. None of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.

- Finally, is it ok if I record the screen and the audio during our session today? Our team will use this as backup in case we need to refer to to make sure our notes are accurate. The recordings will be destroyed after we do this. 

- **While we are so very grateful to have you here and get your feedback, the number one priority is making sure you feel comfortable in this session so if for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop. Just let me know at any point if you’re uncomfortable continuing, and we will end.**

- Does that all make sense, and sound okay to you?

- Great! Any questions before we continue?

- Ok, I'm going to hit the record button now. 

_Start recording._

- Is it ok if we record this session?

      4.  Have you used Login.gov or ID.me or another system like DS Logon to verify your identity?

### **Section 2: Set up screen share - 5 minutes**

#### **Review**

- During our session today, I am going to have you imagine that you have just created a VA.gov account and you are logging in for the first time. I will share a link to the pages you will interact with.

* Before you open the link, I would like to ask you to share your screen. I can walk you through how to start the screen share

### **Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes**

Moderator: Thank you so much for the feedback so far! We're getting close to the end so I have just a few more questions for you about the overall experience today.

Questions:

1. If you had a magic wand and could fix anything about the overall process for new Veterans setting up their account with VA.gov, what would you do?

2. Is there anything we didn’t cover today that you’d like to share with me?

3. Any questions for me about what we covered today?

### **Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes**

Moderator: We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.\
Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

### **Emergency Exit**

\[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so it's easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
