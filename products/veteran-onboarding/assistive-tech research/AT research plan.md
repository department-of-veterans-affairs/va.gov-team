# CAIA Pilot Research Plan for Veteran Onboarding Assistive Tech

IIR Team, Fall 2024


## Background

### What problem is your product trying to solve?

- As Veterans create accounts and login to VA.gov, **we want to provide a more welcoming experience that establishes VA as a source of support and assistance as Veterans navigate the site and authenticated experience for the first time**. 

* Since the VA strives for accessibility beyond compliance, we also want to ensure that we are meeting the VA’s accessibility standards. To achieve this, we are conducting internal testing with assistive technology tools to determine if the site can be navigated and tasks complete. We will be specifically looking to gain awareness of the experiences of Veterans using accessibility tools such as:

  - Screen readers (Voiceover/ Talkback)

  - Alternative navigation users

  - Dynamic Text (large text, magnification)

## Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)

- Because there are separate initiatives focused on the transitioning service member experience prior to authentication, we are focused on a product that exists within the authenticated experience, once a Veteran has created a new account and logged in.


## What is Veterans’ familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?

- This is a new product; our MVP version is a message on My VA focused on providing Veterans with: 

* 1\) a brief welcome message 

* 2\) A prompt to review their contact information once they have completed LOA 3.

## OCTO Priorities

This research supports the 2024 goal of “Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.”


## Veteran Journey

This research is most closely related to a moment that matters within two early phases of the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf).\
Getting out: Engaging VA to access benefits and services\
Starting up: Attending to health needs (moment that matters)


## Research Goals

**What are you trying to learn from this research?**

- Identify if we are meeting **the VA’s experience standards** of comprehension, consistency, credibility, efficiency, findability, health and safety, and usability are met for Veterans using Assistive Technology (AT).

- Determine if Veterans using AT find the proposed alert and update/edit contact information designs **simple to navigate and and the information easy to update**.


### Outcome

**How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process?** **What will you do with your learnings?**

- Our learnings will inform us of changes that needs to be made including:

  - Adjustments to align with VA experience standards

  - Updates to the Welcome message to support Assistive Technology(AT)

  - Updates to the contact information experience to support Assistive Technology(AT) 

- We will make changes as we can to the designs to support the use of AT. 


### Research questions

1. Are participants able to successfully navigate to key tasks on the website using assistive technology (keyboard, voice, and zoom/magnifier)?

   1. Which tasks, if any, do participants struggle finding? Where do they expect to find those tasks?

   2. Which tasks, if any, do participants struggle completing? How do they expect to complete those tasks?


### Hypothesis

Based on the previous research, we hypothesize that we’ll confirm that:

1. Focused actions that will improve their overall experience. Veterans reported that the “complexity of VA discourages people from applying for benefits, especially for people with cognitive considerations” (TSM: Research Review). While we cannot simplify eligibility requirements and application process within the scope of this project, we can reduce the cognitive load of account creation by providing quick actions, like reviewing contact information, that will support the Veterans' overall experience when they do begin to apply for benefits.

2. We also hypothesize that participants will be able to complete tasks proposed to them and will have a clear understanding of the value the proposed tasks provide.


### Methodology

We conduct remote, moderated, think-aloud interviews with usability testing with a CAIA representative over Zoom. During the session, we will have the participant share their screen and complete a series of tasks while they “think aloud”.


### Location

We will do remote testing with the CAIA participants using assistive tech on Zoom.


### Research materials

Provide a link to any materials you need to run your study, including any materials needed for set up and recruitment.
