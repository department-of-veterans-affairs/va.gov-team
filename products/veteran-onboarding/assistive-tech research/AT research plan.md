# Research Plan for Veteran Onboarding Assistive Tech

IIR Team, Fall 2024


# Background

## What problem is your product trying to solve?

- As Veterans create accounts and login to VA.gov, **we want to provide a more welcoming experience that establishes VA as a source of support and assistance as Veterans navigate the site and authenticated experience for the first time**. 

* Since the VA strives for accessibility beyond compliance, we also want to ensure that we are meeting the VA’s accessibility standards. To achieve this, we are testing with Veterans who are blind or have low vision to determine if they can navigate and complete tasks presented after initial account creation and log in. We will be specifically looking to gain awareness of the experiences of Veterans using accessibility tools such as:

  - Screen readers (Voiceover/ Talkback)

  - Alternative navigation users

  - Dynamic Text (large text, magnification)

# Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)

- Because there are separate initiatives focused on the transitioning service member experience prior to authentication, we are focused on a product that exists within the authenticated experience, once a Veteran has created a new account and logged in.


# What is Veterans’ familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?

- This is a new product; our MVP version is a message on My VA focused on providing Veterans with: 

* 1\) a brief welcome message 

* 2\) A prompt to review their contact information once they have completed LOA 3.

# OCTO Priorities

This research supports the 2024 goal of “Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.”


# Veteran Journey

This research is most closely related to a moment that matters within two early phases of the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf).\
Getting out: Engaging VA to access benefits and services\
Starting up: Attending to health needs (moment that matters)


# Research Goals

**What are you trying to learn from this research?**

- Identify if we are meeting **the VA’s experience standards** of comprehension, consistency, credibility, efficiency, findability, health and safety, and usability are met for Veterans using Assistive Technology (AT).

- Determine if the welcome message helps Veterans using AT understand **where they are** when they first log in to VA.gov and **what next steps they need to take**. 

- Determine if Veterans using AT **understand the value** of adding/editing their contact information in the onboarding experience

- Determine if Veterans using AT find the proposed alert and update/edit contact information designs **simple to navigate and and the information easy to update**.


## Outcome

**How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process?** **What will you do with your learnings?**

- Our learnings will inform us of changes that needs to be made including:

  - Adjustments to align with VA experience standards

  - Updates to the Welcome message

  - Updates to the contact information experience

- Once these areas meet our expectations we will be able to release the welcome message and contact information updates to production.


## Research questions

1. Are participants able to successfully navigate to key tasks on the website using assistive technology (keyboard, voice, and zoom/magnifier)?

   1. Which tasks, if any, do participants struggle finding? Where do they expect to find those tasks?

   2. Which tasks, if any, do participants struggle completing? How do they expect to complete those tasks?

2. What, if anything, would participants want to change about what they experience after they create a VA.gov account and log in for the first time?

3. What, if anything, in the onboarding experience do the participants respond to positively. Do they express that they feel “welcome” or “supported” as they explore their benefits?

4. What changes, if any, can we make to improve the onboarding experience to help Veterans determine their first actions on VA.gov?

5. What are the challenges Veterans face when first engaging with VA.gov and setting up their account?

6. How do Veterans engage with their profile and information upon first logging in to their account?


## Hypothesis

Based on the previous research, we hypothesize that we’ll confirm that:

1. Veterans want specific and personalized eligibility recommendations (which is likely out of scope until the creation of a tool like BDS. In the meantime, we are communicating and sharing updates with the VES Transition Team and will look for opportunities to integrate new tools during onboarding).

2. However, we hypothesize that the onboarding experience can be improved by a more human-centered approach, such as:\
   a. Messaging that welcome Veterans and reaffirm that they are entitled to their benefits ([TSM: Research Review](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/onboarding/discovery-research/research-review.md), which references additional supporting studies, as well, indicates that Veterans “feel hesitation or shame about using VA benefits because people feel they are undeserving or taking away from others”) and establishes VA as a trusted support system early on in a Veteran’s journey ([TSM: Research Review](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/onboarding/discovery-research/research-review.md) notes that “It is a major adjustment for service members to acclimate to civilian life; a significant factor in this is the lack of structure and direction, and the departure from their military community and support system.”)\
   b. Focused actions that will improve their overall experience. Veterans reported that the “complexity of VA discourages people from applying for benefits, especially for people with cognitive considerations” (TSM: Research Review). While we cannot simplify eligibility requirements and application process within the scope of this project, we can reduce the cognitive load of account creation by providing quick actions, like reviewing contact information, that will support the Veterans' overall experience when they do begin to apply for benefits.

3. We also hypothesize that participants will be able to complete tasks proposed to them and will have a clear understanding of the value the proposed tasks provide.


## Methodology

We conduct remote, moderated, think-aloud user interviews with usability testing over Zoom. During the session, we will have the participant share their screen and complete a series of tasks while they “think aloud”.


## Location

We will do remote testing using Zoom, using Perigean’s account.


## Research materials

_Note: your OCTO/VA lead must review and approve all research materials – including this plan – prior to submitting a recruitment request._

Provide a link to any materials you need to run your study, including any materials needed for set up and recruitment.

# Recruitment

### Recruitment approach

We will work with Perigean to recruit Veterans for this research.

We request that Perigean:

- shares a link or screenshot of the recruitment survey for this study, so we can review it before it goes out to participants

- If we're facing issues with no-shows or cancellations, we'll ask that you call the remaining participant to remind them about the session, one day in advance.


## Recruitment criteria

We will recruit 8 Veterans or Service Members for:

- minimum of 3 sessions with screen reader users

- minimum of 2 sessions with alternative navigation users

- minimum of 1 session with a screen magnification use

|                 |                    |          |               |            |                 |
