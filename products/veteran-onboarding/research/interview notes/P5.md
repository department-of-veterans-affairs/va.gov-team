### **Section 2: [My VA: LOA1 Message] - 10 minutes**


#### **Review**

Moderator: Now I’d like you to take a moment to review this page. It is a prototype, so in case something doesn’t work like it might on a real site, just go ahead and share with us how you think it should work.

Please take as long as you’d like to read and explore. If you’re comfortable, I’d love to hear you “think out loud” as you go and share any thoughts. Remember, there are no wrong answers and I will not be offended by anything you share.

Questions:

1. Does this page look familiar to you? [If Yes] How often have you used or visited this page?
2. What, if anything, about this page stands out to you?
3. What were you hoping to find here?
4. Is the information provided what you expected to see here? Why or why not?
5. What do you imagine this page is used for?
6. Is there anything here you don’t see that you would find valuable?

#### **Task**

Moderator: Now that you’ve taken a look at the page, what would you do from here?

_If the participant would like to verify, tell them to go ahead and do so and encourage them to continue through the simulated "verification" screens, then move on to Section 3 questions. If the participant clicks on the other links, ask them “Where would you expect that link to go?”_

### **Section 3: [LOA3 Task List] - 10 minutes**

#### **Review**

_If the user did not attempt to verify:_
_Moderator: Now we’re going to pretend that you’ve gone through the identity verification process that was called out by the green box. Go ahead and click on the “Verify your identity” link.

_Encourage participant to continue through the simulated "verification" screens_

_If the participant has already ‘verified’ as part of the previous section, move on to probing questions._

Questions:

1. What, if anything, about this page stands out to you now?
2. Is there anything different that you notice about this page?

#### **Task**

Moderator: Now that you’ve taken a look at the page, what would you do from here?

_If the participant would like to add their contact info, tell them to go ahead and do so, then move on to Section 4. If the participant clicks on a different link on My VA or the second task ask them, “Where would you expect that link to go?”_

### **Section 4: [[Profile Completion](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/profile-completion/discovery-research/conversation-guide.md)] - 15-20 minutes**

#### **Review - Entry Point**

_If the participant has not yet moved to add their contact info, prompt them to click the “Add your contact information link” in the task list._
_Moderator: Now imagine this was your profile on the website, what would you do from here?

* _If participant says they’d click on the first task, tell them to go ahead_
* _If the participant says they’d click on the “Go to my Profile” link, tell them to go ahead_
* _If participant says anything else, ask why they would be interested in clicking on that thing, and then guide them to click on the alert_


#### **Task - Evaluate steps 0-2 [Add contact info page, add email, add phone] of the Profile Completion Flow**


_Note:Entry Point could be from Task List or from Profile Page_

Moderator: Go ahead and take a look at this page, and tell me what you make of it. Don’t click on anything yet, but I’m curious to know what you’d do from here.


_Depending on whether they entered via the “Profile” link or the task prompt, they might end up on Profile with the alert or the Add your Contact Information “pre-flow” page with instructions._

Questions for Profile page with Alert



1. Does this page look familiar to you? [if Yes] How often have you used or visited this page?
2. What, if anything about this page, stands out to you?
3. Based on what you see on this page, what might you do next and why?

_After the participant has time to review the page and the alert, prompt them to click on the “Add your contact information” link. If they express a desire to click on other Profile components, ask them why and what they would expect to happen._

**Notes if PROFILE LINK was clicked:**   
N/A

Questions for Add your Contact Information Page

1. Based on what you see and read here, are you required to provide this information?
2. What would you expect to happen if you clicked on “remind me later”?
3. When should “later” be?
4. How would you expect to be reminded?

**Notes if CONTACT INFO TASK LINK was clicked:**
* **He thinks that a person should be required to enter information, he doesn’t see that a person is required to add information but feels like it should be**
* **Not sure how he would be reminded later because there is not a way to contact you, that is what is being added**
* **Later is a vague description of time, he is not sure when later is**
* **Might as well say “do you want to start over later”**
* **He thinks that if you want to be contacted then you need to enter it or you will be asked over and over**
* **Not sure what would happen if he clicked continue and did not fill in the text fields**
* **Since it is a government site it will take a lot of time with little return**
* **Thinks that information previously entered would be saved to his profile**
* **If you click save I think it would save if he didn’t click save he doesn’t think it would save**
* **To go back and edit information he would click back**

Moderator: Thanks for that. Now you can click on things as you normally would, and please remember to think out loud as much as possible so I can understand how this works for you.

_If needed, instruct participant to click on the “Add your contact information” action link_

_When participant is on step one - email address and step two - mobile phone:_ Moderator: Since this is a prototype, these fields won't actually allow information to be entered. You can just click on the field to populate text before moving on.

_Allow participant to go through the flow. As needed, ask:_

1. Is the information here required?
2. What would happen if you decided to continue without providing the information?
3. Do you know how much information you will need to enter or how many screens you’ll need to review for this task? (Trying to evaluate if they notice and understand Step X of X heading)

Things to note

* Does the participant believe the information is required to move to the next step?
* What did the participant expect from “remind me later”?
* Was anything unclear or confusing?

#### **Task - Evaluate dismissing workflow and remind me later**

_Pause participant on step 3 - mailing address_

Moderator: I’m going to pause you here for just a moment to ask a few questions.

Questions:

1. If you changed your mind and wanted to get out of this workflow, would the email and phone number be saved to your profile?
2. On this step, what do you expect will happen if you choose “remind me later” instead of finishing?
3. If you wanted to return to a previous screen to change information that you’ve already entered, what would you do?

Things to note

* What did the participant expect from “remind me later”?
* Did they understand or expect that any information previously entered would be saved to their profile if they exited?

**Final confirmation page**

Moderator: Take a moment to review this page and the information provided. 

Questions:

1. After reviewing the information here, how do you expect VA to reach you with updates?
2. Where would you go from here?
3. If next time you log in, you wanted to review or edit the information you just entered, what would you do?
4. If you wanted to return to the My VA page, where you first saw the task list, what would you do?

Things to note:

* **Used link to navigate back to MyVA**
* **Didn’t have a problem seeing that the Add contact info was complete**
* **Would continue completing the task list after seeing the completion notice**
* **Thought the list would maybe go away once all the steps were completed**

**My VA Home page**

Moderator: Now we’re back to where we started.

Questions:

1. Take a look at this page again. Do you notice anything different about it, now that you have added your contact information?
2. Is there anything else you would do on this page?
3. Once you have completed the second task listed here, what do you expect would happen to the task list?

Things to note:

* Does the participant notice the status has changed?

### **Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes**

Moderator: We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans. \

### **Emergency Exit**

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
