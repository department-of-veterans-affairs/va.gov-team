<v Participant 1>The weather is so interesting because. Yeah,

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.560
<v Participant 1>yeah, this is the best time for it, where

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.080
<v Participant 1>it's not hot anymore, but it's not too cold,

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.360
<v Participant 1>so. Yes, sir, I get that. So what branch

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.760
<v Participant 1>of service did you serve in?

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.280
<v Participant 2>Navy.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.880
<v Participant 1>The Navy. Okay. And for how many years?

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.080
<v Participant 2>Seven.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.040
<v Participant 1>Seven.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.600
<v Participant 1>Wow. Wow. And when did you transition out?

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.080
<v Participant 2>In 84.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.520
<v Participant 1>In 84.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:26.760
<v Participant 1>Okay, so a few years ago. How about using

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.960
<v Participant 1>va.gov? have you ever used va.gov?

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.080
<v Participant 2>I have.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.080
<v Participant 1>You have.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.480
<v Participant 1>When did you create that account?

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:42.920
<v Participant 2>Oh, I guess about maybe 10 years ago or so,

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.000
<v Participant 2>but maybe more than that. More.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.970
<v Participant 1>But at least 10, 10 years ago. Okay, and

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.450
<v Participant 1>how often do you use it now?

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.930
<v Participant 2>Not as much as I was using it when I did.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.410
<v Participant 2>Using it was setting it up. It was something

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:07.810
<v Participant 2>that. That at the time I had a concern with,

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.530
<v Participant 2>so being on there, trying to get the information

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.860
<v Participant 2>I needed. So I was on there.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.220
<v Participant 2>But as far as, as of late, I think that one

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.900
<v Participant 2>of the requirements. You said have you. In

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.580
<v Participant 2>10 days or so. I hadn't been on. I hadn't

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.780
<v Participant 2>visited it that long.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.700
<v Participant 2>I mean, more than that long ago.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.340
<v Participant 1>Okay. When was the last time you think you

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.940
<v Participant 1>visited?

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.830
<v Participant 2>What was it that I had to think of? I was

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:44.670
<v Participant 2>looking up.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.750
<v Participant 2>I think I was looking up some information

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.870
<v Participant 2>about a va, something that was in the news.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.160
<v Participant 2>And I want this to get it clarified or by

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.520
<v Participant 2>looking on the page to see if it was. They

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.400
<v Participant 2>were saying the same thing. So I went there

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.520
<v Participant 2>trying to search for it, but that's about

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.880
<v Participant 2>it.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:17.560
<v Participant 1>Okay.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.000
<v Participant 1>Okay.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.200
<v Participant 2>You.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.840
<v Participant 1>You heard about something and then you went

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.320
<v Participant 1>to VA to search for it?

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.120
<v Participant 2>Yes. Yeah.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.040
<v Participant 2>Wow. Something that the. The Congress or

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.590
<v Participant 2>cuts or. I don't know. It was the Director.

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.390
<v Participant 2>I don't know. It was something that was happening

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:41.710
<v Participant 2>to us that I felt like it was to my benefit

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:44.350
<v Participant 2>to research and see if it was true.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.190
<v Participant 1>Okay, got it. Got it. Okay.

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.750
<v Participant 1>So have you signed up for any benefits with

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:52.830
<v Participant 1>va.gov.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.640
<v Participant 2>Other than my just going to my regular VA

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.000
<v Participant 2>Women's Services at the clinics.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.920
<v Participant 1>Yes.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.880
<v Participant 2>That's what is part of what you're asking

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.280
<v Participant 2>for. That's about it.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.000
<v Participant 1>So just VA Healthcare.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.400
<v Participant 1>Right.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:16.920
<v Participant 2>It Virginia Healthcare.

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:25.010
<v Participant 2>Okay. Again. But he's brought to my mind

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:29.050
<v Participant 2>it was, I had made a disability claim at

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.130
<v Participant 2>the time and I was trying to get all the

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.290
<v Participant 2>information that they need and everything

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.010
<v Participant 2>and thusly it had not been declined in any

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.130
<v Participant 2>case. But that's what I was remembering.

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.170
<v Participant 1>Got it, Got it.

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.130
<v Participant 1>So you is that that's the reason that you

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.730
<v Participant 1>went to va.gov in the first place for a disability

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:51.130
<v Participant 1>claim?

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:52.970
<v Participant 2>Yeah. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.930
<v Participant 1>Okay.

00:04:54.170 --> 00:05:00.210
<v Participant 1>Okay. Got it. Okay. I'm wondering, when you

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.490
<v Participant 1>go to new websites, are you the person who

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.170
<v Participant 1>likes to read everything and then do something

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.210
<v Participant 1>or do you like to just arrive and figure

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:10.090
<v Participant 1>your way out?

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:16.080
<v Participant 2>I like to research and compare and view and,

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:23.680
<v Participant 2>and search views on, on opinions and everything.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.840
<v Participant 2>So I, that I do. Yes. But before I do jump

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:29.840
<v Participant 2>into anything.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.280
<v Participant 1>Got it, got it. Okay.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.160
<v Participant 1>And what would have been the most helpful

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.600
<v Participant 1>for you when you first went to va.gov.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.520
<v Participant 2>If anything, I, I, I can say from any site

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:54.840
<v Participant 2>that I go to is that they have a 800 number

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.880
<v Participant 2>somewhere near right on the page, clear view,

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.720
<v Participant 2>you know, so that I can personally talk to

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.560
<v Participant 2>a person. I mean really talk to a person.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.260
<v Participant 2>Not just like anything other than a person.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.500
<v Participant 2>I mean, we'll call you back later.

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:13.540

<v Participant 2>if it's important for me to get the information.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.520
<v Participant 2>I do the email, but I would prefer talking

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.120
<v Participant 2>to somebody and so I would like that 800

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.120

<v Participant 1>There's a big blue button on the bottom that

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:08.070
<v Participant 1>says share as well.

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:09.110

<v Participant 1>So I. I sent you a link. Let me resend it.

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:40.480

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:46.160
<v Participant 1>Yeah, let's click on the zoom on the bottom.

<v Participant 1>kind of popping up?

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:23.720
<v Participant 2>It said you are screen sharing. And then

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:28.360
<v Participant 2>it's got a thing. There's chat with a number

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:29.240
<v Participant 2>one in it.

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:33.000
<v Participant 1>Let's click chat with the number one in it.

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:33.720
<v Participant 2>Okay.

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:39.040
<v Participant 1>And then do you see a link there?

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:41.640
<v Participant 2>Okay, there's a link. There's a link in there.

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:43.150
<v Participant 1>Click on that one.

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:01.310
<v Participant 2>Is that what you want me. This is that what?

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:06.790
<v Participant 1>Yeah, let me see it really shouldn't be doing

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:09.800
<v Participant 1>this. I'm not. This has happened to me before.

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:14.360
<v Participant 2>Yeah, that's okay, I'm sorry. Go ahead. But

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:18.840
<v Participant 2>that's where I was before I went all, all

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:21.360

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:22.400
<v Participant 2>Brought myself back to you.

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.560

<v Participant 2>had.

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:28.120

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:28.920
<v Participant 1>and press Continue.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.320

<v Participant 1>Do you see where it says school, Work, personal

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:55.700
<v Participant 1>projects.

00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:58.180
<v Participant 2>Okay, school. Continue.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:12:58.980
<v Participant 1>Fine.

00:12:59.220 --> 00:12:59.620
<v Participant 2>Continue.

00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:00.420
<v Participant 1>Continue.

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:03.790
<v Participant 2>Okay, educator.

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:05.630
<v Participant 1>Yep, that's fine.

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:06.670
<v Participant 2>Okay.

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:15.390
<v Participant 1>Yeah, if you click on that and press Continue,

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:25.470
<v Participant 1>something else is fine. Continue.

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:31.720
<v Participant 1>No, it's my first time.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:40.440
<v Participant 1>Continue. And do you see in the upper left

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:44.920
<v Participant 1>corner there's like an. It looks like a repeat

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:50.240
<v Participant 1>button or a refresh button all the way in

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.360
<v Participant 1>the upper left corner of the screen.

00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:01.140
<v Participant 2>Oh, okay. Okay. Not, not refresh. Not that

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:01.500
<v Participant 2>one.

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:02.940
<v Participant 1>Go ahead and click that.

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:07.340
<v Participant 2>Okay. When we do refresh, refresh.

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:22.670
<v Participant 1>Okay, so I'm glad we got here. This is a

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:27.110
<v Participant 1>prototype of va.gov and where you would land

00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:30.310
<v Participant 1>on when you come to va.gov for the first

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:30.710
<v Participant 1>time.

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:31.990
<v Participant 2>Yes, sir.

00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:36.150
<v Participant 1>So this is a pop up that we're trying out

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:38.470
<v Participant 1>and I'd love to hear your thoughts on it.

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:42.670
<v Participant 2>Okay, so right here in front of me, it says

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:45.110
<v Participant 2>here, welcome to VA government.

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:50.120
<v Participant 2>Now you have a VA verified VA government

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:54.320
<v Participant 2>account. You can apply for VA benefits. Most

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:57.960
<v Participant 2>people start with one of the fees. So you

00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:00.440
<v Participant 2>don't want me to click on that just extra

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:03.240
<v Participant 2>box out because you want the screen.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:05.680
<v Participant 1>Let's keep it.

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:07.640
<v Participant 1>Let's look at the box. Let's look at the

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:11.520
<v Participant 1>box. Okay, so what do you think about a box

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:12.120
<v Participant 1>like this?

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:16.540
<v Participant 2>Well, I have no problem with it because that

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:22.340
<v Participant 2>helps me if, if I am coming to va.gov and

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:25.940
<v Participant 2>I have a specific concern and it. And if

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:29.300
<v Participant 2>perhaps by some chance that one of these

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:32.780
<v Participant 2>three are. Are one of them, then that really

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:35.820
<v Participant 2>helps me off, right off the bat to go to

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:39.480
<v Participant 2>that. Click on which one? Well, like I said

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:43.720
<v Participant 2>at the beginning when I started off with

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:48.080
<v Participant 2>va.com that was VA disability compensation.

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:52.320
<v Participant 2>It would have helped me tremendously having

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:54.440
<v Participant 2>that right there and then I wouldn't have

00:15:54.440 --> 00:16:02.240
<v Participant 2>to go through all the myriads of sites or

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:05.380
<v Participant 2>sites links and stuff like that. So I have

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:09.260
<v Participant 2>no problem with that. Or if they had art,

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:15.180
<v Participant 2>they put another one like other or more click

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:18.220
<v Participant 2>more selections or something like that. But

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:22.060
<v Participant 2>you know, having a few up there like that,

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:23.900
<v Participant 2>it help. It will help a lot.

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:29.420
<v Participant 1>What would be in that more or other option?

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:34.950
<v Participant 2>Healthcare disability. Healthcare education

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:46.550
<v Participant 2>of transition from civilian life. I meant,

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:49.510
<v Participant 2>I meant transition to civilian life.

00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:58.080
<v Participant 2>That right there or what else?

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:03.680
<v Participant 2>That's one, just one off the top of my head.

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.640
<v Participant 1>Okay. Benefits for transitioning veterans

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:09.400
<v Participant 1>and gov.

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.360
<v Participant 2>And, and also. Oh yeah, I got education.

00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:15.120
<v Participant 2>I was about to say GI Bill and such, but

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:16.960
<v Participant 2>this education covers that.

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:20.760
<v Participant 1>Got it. Okay, so now that it's your first

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:23.230
<v Participant 1>time here, what would you expect expect to

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:27.950
<v Participant 1>see on VA Healthcare link if you clicked

00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:28.390
<v Participant 1>on that?

00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:39.950
<v Participant 2>Basically explaining to veterans what they

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:46.950
<v Participant 2>can expect to have as far as the care that

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:51.260
<v Participant 2>VA will be responsible to give them different

00:17:52.460 --> 00:18:01.820
<v Participant 2>locations and different concerns and, and,

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:07.940
<v Participant 2>and how to apply. And again, if there's no

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:12.220
<v Participant 2>if they still have a problem about either,

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:17.180
<v Participant 2>if they think their concerns is not addressed,

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:20.480
<v Participant 2>they give them a number that they can call

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:23.440
<v Participant 2>to voice their concerns.

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:32.240
<v Participant 1>Got it, Got it. Okay, so what about disability

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.400
<v Participant 1>compensation? What would you expect there?

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:40.400
<v Participant 2>Oh, especially the application procedure.

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:45.880
<v Participant 2>Making sure that we understand specifically

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:51.600
<v Participant 2>what is required of us and that we, if there

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:56.920
<v Participant 2>are myriads of forms or whatever that they

00:18:56.920 --> 00:19:02.320
<v Participant 2>will have a library that has that form available

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:08.000
<v Participant 2>that we can download and not search for it.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:15.900
<v Participant 2>And, and if, if anything those who are tech

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:25.220
<v Participant 2>savvy will be able to send it off versus

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:29.620
<v Participant 2>you know, we have also having the mail option

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:34.420
<v Participant 2>but have been able to fax, text or whatever

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:40.600
<v Participant 2>but, but also again making sure that each

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:43.920
<v Participant 2>line of the application is explained and

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:48.280
<v Participant 2>what you don't want, what you do want and

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:52.840
<v Participant 2>what you won't accept and just be very specific

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:59.520
<v Participant 2>so that our application will not be rejected

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:03.760
<v Participant 2>or on hold for something that we weren't

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:05.240
<v Participant 2>particularly aware of.

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:12.210
<v Participant 1>Got it, got it. And what about education

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:13.570
<v Participant 1>and training benefits?

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:23.250
<v Participant 2>Again, letting the veteran know that this

00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:30.450
<v Participant 2>is education is available for every possible.

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:35.610
<v Participant 1>Possible.

00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:42.410
<v Participant 2>Field and well, I guess most of mostly that

00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:46.650
<v Participant 2>is reassuring the veteran that even when

00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:51.850
<v Participant 2>with the different, I want to say mos our

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:56.130
<v Participant 2>job description, I can see also having a

00:20:56.130 --> 00:21:00.620
<v Participant 2>hard times and what my, what my skills would

00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:06.020
<v Participant 2>be as far as transitioning to the civilian

00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:09.220
<v Participant 2>world and helping us to know that. Well,

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:12.700
<v Participant 2>you can see this can take you this way and

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:15.260
<v Participant 2>if you take you this way. These are some

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:17.660
<v Participant 2>of the companies that are interested in helping

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:21.940
<v Participant 2>employing veterans and just helping them

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:25.760
<v Participant 2>step out that way in those kind of baby steps

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:29.880
<v Participant 2>when transit for education or. And also as

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:33.920
<v Participant 2>I described, you asked me about the transition

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:37.680
<v Participant 2>from veteran from the military to civilian

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:45.840
<v Participant 2>and also helping them to some.

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:49.450
<v Participant 2>I have postponed getting education until

00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:54.090
<v Participant 2>or getting an education or getting a higher

00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:57.770
<v Participant 2>education and so that this will help them

00:21:58.170 --> 00:22:02.170
<v Participant 2>say how we would apply, what is, how much

00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:10.210
<v Participant 2>is amount I am, you know, getting to help

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:16.100
<v Participant 2>me. And again, how do I enroll applications?

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:18.420
<v Participant 2>And therefore.

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:22.460
<v Participant 1>Okay, great. Would you be able to go ahead

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:24.020
<v Participant 1>and click on the first link.

00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:26.660
<v Participant 2>VA Healthcare.

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:28.180
<v Participant 1>VA Healthcare.

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:36.700
<v Participant 1>What do you think about this page as the

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:37.060
<v Participant 1>link?

<v Participant 1>Got it, got it. Okay, let's go ahead and

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:09.340
<v Participant 1>click on the screen again.

00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:11.660
<v Participant 2>Where?

00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:13.340
<v Participant 1>Anywhere.

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:16.940
<v Participant 2>In anywhere.

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:21.180
<v Participant 1>Yep. And it'll just bring us back so.

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:24.300
<v Participant 2>Oh, oh, oh. Okay. Okay.

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:24.860
<v Participant 2>Okay.

<v Participant 1>So let's talk about disability compensation.

00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:31.270
<v Participant 1>Now go ahead and click on that one.

00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:45.230
<v Participant 2>There it is. Oh, it's, it's. It said what

00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:45.750
<v Participant 2>I said.

00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:50.710
<v Participant 2>Oh, that's good. Oh, how.

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:56.120
<v Participant 1>Yeah, tell me about this reaction. Why. Why

<v Participant 1>are you so happy?

00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:00.600
<v Participant 2>I mean, because it's saying what I, I said.

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:03.000
<v Participant 2>I mean, I, I think I said.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.520
<v Participant 2>I mean I. Yeah, I. When to file evidence.

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:10.520
<v Participant 2>You need to back it up that you don't. You

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:14.800
<v Participant 2>don't want file additional forms for your

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:17.840
<v Participant 2>disability files. Additional form, yeah,

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:18.960
<v Participant 2>very files.

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:21.520
<v Participant 2>And then I like, hopefully that is where

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:25.120
<v Participant 2>the library of forms are there where they

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:30.840
<v Participant 2>say we need form 1815 dash. Well, go to that

00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:33.800
<v Participant 2>library. There it is. And, and you just make

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:37.080
<v Participant 2>your copy or you able to type it and then

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:40.480
<v Participant 2>send it off to them or whatever and file

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:42.400
<v Participant 2>it online. Okay, very good.

00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:45.370
<v Participant 2>And it gives you, you know, that's the question

00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:49.170
<v Participant 2>how long it takes. What does it. I mean what

00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:53.810
<v Participant 2>time frame we're looking at and manage benefits

00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:57.930
<v Participant 2>and. Okay. Yeah, very good, very good.

00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:02.730
<v Participant 1>Okay. Would this have been a useful page

00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:04.650
<v Participant 1>for you when you first starting out?

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:10.380

<v Participant 1>So you do. So you like this page. What about

00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:28.540
<v Participant 1>this page do you like besides it being aligned

00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:29.700
<v Participant 1>with your expectations?

00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:41.310
<v Participant 2>Again, it has addressed them as you've said.

00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:47.550
<v Participant 2>For also more resources is making an effort

00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:50.750
<v Participant 2>to also, you know, it's something that's

00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:54.510
<v Participant 2>not necessarily right there in front of you.

00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:57.070
<v Participant 2>You can click on more resources to see if

00:26:57.470 --> 00:27:01.720
<v Participant 2>there is something that is not there. Maybe

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:04.680
<v Participant 2>more resources would address what your concern

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:05.240
<v Participant 2>is.

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:10.360
<v Participant 1>Got it, got it. Has everything you might

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:12.920
<v Participant 1>need while you're looking for this kind of

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:13.320
<v Participant 1>stuff?

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:14.600
<v Participant 2>Yes, sir.

00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:18.560
<v Participant 1>Okay. Okay, so go ahead and click on the

00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:18.920
<v Participant 1>screen.

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:20.040
<v Participant 1>Just anywhere else.

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:20.840
<v Participant 2>Yes.

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:25.120
<v Participant 1>And tell me about this last one. Let's go

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:26.680
<v Participant 1>ahead and click on education and training

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:27.160
<v Participant 1>benefits.

00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:38.870
<v Participant 2>There you go. All right, very good. Ooh.

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:42.830
<v Participant 1>What was that? Ooh, about what? What were

00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:44.990
<v Participant 1>you looking at right there.

00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:50.310
<v Participant 2>Where it says not a veteran? Well, I mean,

00:27:51.910 --> 00:27:53.430
<v Participant 2>hey, that's good.

00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:57.920
<v Participant 2>I mean, yeah, okay, that's fine. I mean,

00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:03.920
<v Participant 2>meaning that that, that addresses those who

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:10.040
<v Participant 2>are the support group like wife, son, daughters

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:13.680
<v Participant 2>or veterans. And I, I would think hopefully

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:17.320
<v Participant 2>that that is, you know, because I think that's

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:20.330
<v Participant 2>something I just popped in my head. I don't

00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:23.290
<v Participant 2>know if that's it. Excuse me.

00:28:24.490 --> 00:28:28.250
<v Participant 2>Get my words together. I don't know exactly

00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:32.850
<v Participant 2>what is the subtopics of that topics and

00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:36.970
<v Participant 2>then subtopics of not a veteran. But hopefully

00:28:36.970 --> 00:28:41.130
<v Participant 2>it is those they're addressing those who

00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:46.170
<v Participant 2>are, as I said, spouses, children of that

00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:50.370
<v Participant 2>veteran because they would have, they could

00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:54.490
<v Participant 2>find out if they're eligible also for any

00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:57.970
<v Participant 2>compensation from, you know, veteran that

00:28:58.210 --> 00:29:02.929
<v Participant 2>has missing in action, prisoner war, deceased

00:29:02.929 --> 00:29:08.450
<v Participant 2>or whatever. So yeah, didn't even. That was

00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:10.290
<v Participant 2>nice to see.

00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:12.810
<v Participant 2>Not. Hadn't thought of it, but that's good

00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:16.020
<v Participant 2>to have there. That's a good, good thought.

00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:17.300
<v Participant 2>Whoever did that.

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:20.340
<v Participant 1>Okay, okay.

00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:24.420
<v Participant 1>In terms of this page versus the other two

00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:29.100
<v Participant 1>you've seen which, which do you prefer? And

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:31.340
<v Participant 1>not, not necessarily about the benefit, but

00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:33.460
<v Participant 1>I'm thinking more in terms of how the page.

00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:44.670
<v Participant 2>I like this, this one gi the benefits of

00:29:44.670 --> 00:29:50.750
<v Participant 2>GI Bill. I like how it's trying its best

00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:57.390
<v Participant 2>to give you as much information as possible

00:29:58.190 --> 00:30:05.150
<v Participant 2>to get the resources and financial or informative

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:11.260
<v Participant 2>about your GI benefits as well as also giving

00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:15.500
<v Participant 2>you the 800 numbers that right there. Still

00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:18.460
<v Participant 2>trying to find something. Trying to look

00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:21.540
<v Participant 2>through the everything to see if there's

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:25.020
<v Participant 2>an 800 number on any of those links, but

00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:26.540
<v Participant 2>it's right there in front of you.

00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:28.620
<v Participant 1>Do you like the 800 numbers?

00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:33.230
<v Participant 1>Got it, got it. Okay, let's go ahead and

00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:40.270
<v Participant 1>click on the screen one more time now. Now

00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:43.350
<v Participant 1>that you've seen this, I think you kind of

00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:45.390
<v Participant 1>mentioned something's missing, but is anything

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:48.670
<v Participant 1>else missing? What would you or do you like

00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:49.350
<v Participant 1>it as is?

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:10.160
<v Participant 2>Well, I, I think you probably addressed all

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:12.280
<v Participant 2>my concerns. I'm quite sure after I click

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:15.240
<v Participant 2>off I could have said that that was, that

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:22.960
<v Participant 2>was it. But as long as I, I think if anything,

00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:27.060
<v Participant 2>and I'm quite sure it is on each different

00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:31.300
<v Participant 2>topic that they, if there's something that

00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:35.700
<v Participant 2>they are applying for, I Think most of all,

00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:41.540
<v Participant 2>they. They would like to know if the. The

00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:48.340
<v Participant 2>time where they can get feedback, a update

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:49.780
<v Participant 2>or whatever.

00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:56.050
<v Participant 2>Just a site where. Okay, after what you.

00:31:56.050 --> 00:31:59.930
<v Participant 2>You express a time limit of five weeks or

00:31:59.930 --> 00:32:02.970
<v Participant 2>something. Like there's a website which you've

00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:13.890
<v Participant 2>given them as far as something and they can

00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:18.470
<v Participant 2>go to and punched in their information or

00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:22.310
<v Participant 2>case number or whatever. They could go in

00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:26.270
<v Participant 2>and say, this is my case number, and just

00:32:26.270 --> 00:32:27.030
<v Participant 2>let me know.

00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:29.870
<v Participant 2>Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right. That

00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:31.110
<v Participant 2>was good. I.

00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:38.590
<v Participant 2>Where is. Because there's some. I've had

00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:41.590
<v Participant 2>a couple websites. This is a shopping thing

00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:43.320
<v Participant 2>where you. I'm talk.

00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:46.000

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:53.720
<v Participant 2>see, well, box there saying reviewing. And

00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:55.600
<v Participant 2>it's. And you keep going back. Okay, they

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:58.040
<v Participant 2>check. And then you go back and box is check

00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:00.480
<v Participant 2>reviewing in front of the panel.

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:02.760
<v Participant 2>And then you look at that. Okay, this front

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:04.840
<v Participant 2>of the panel. That's good. That's good. And

<v Participant 2>Check right there. They can monitor. Excuse

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:18.790
<v Participant 2>me, their application as it's going through

00:33:18.790 --> 00:33:21.950
<v Participant 2>the procedure. So as to not. I think you'll

00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:24.429
<v Participant 2>free up a whole lot of phone calls and it

00:33:24.429 --> 00:33:24.589
<v Participant 2>be.

00:33:24.589 --> 00:33:26.870
<v Participant 2>And the phone calls will be more. Less like

00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:29.390
<v Participant 2>helping them. Help them with them rather

00:33:29.390 --> 00:33:33.710
<v Participant 2>than always getting calls like. I hadn't

00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:36.330
<v Participant 2>heard. Did he get it?

00:33:36.650 --> 00:33:39.650
<v Participant 2>I. I don't. I don't. I mean, you know, that

00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:43.050
<v Participant 2>kind of thing, that will leave a lot of anxious

00:33:45.370 --> 00:33:53.210
<v Participant 2>veterans, you know, if that could be. I mean.

00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:55.050
<v Participant 1>Yeah, no.

00:33:55.210 --> 00:33:58.090
<v Participant 1>Thank you so much for sharing that. I'm gonna

<v Participant 1>go ahead and chat it. And right where you

00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:17.470
<v Participant 1>clicked on the first link in the. You click

00:34:17.470 --> 00:34:19.110
<v Participant 1>the word chat. Yes.

00:34:21.830 --> 00:34:24.630

<v Participant 2>Okay.

<v Participant 2>And click that message.

00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:34.510
<v Participant 1>Yes, please.

00:34:47.870 --> 00:34:52.190
<v Participant 1>Let's see it looking like the same.

00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:55.580
<v Participant 2>Yes, sir.

00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:04.020
<v Participant 1>Let me just see why we're doing this. Should

00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:07.660
<v Participant 1>be a different version. I'm gonna send you

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:13.100
<v Participant 1>another link and I'm gonna write the word.

00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:14.340
<v Participant 2>Okay. Okay, just a minute.

00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:17.460
<v Participant 2>Just a minute. Maybe. Okay, maybe it's just

00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:18.780
<v Participant 2>a new link. Hold up.

00:35:19.210 --> 00:35:20.250
<v Participant 1>Oh, try that one.

00:35:28.890 --> 00:35:33.970
<v Participant 1>Okay, perfect, perfect. Okay, so here is

00:35:33.970 --> 00:35:36.090
<v Participant 1>a different version of the same thing.

00:35:38.810 --> 00:35:41.010
<v Participant 1>What are your initial thoughts while looking

00:35:41.010 --> 00:35:41.930
<v Participant 1>at this one?

00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:56.740
<v Participant 2>Okay. It just basically addressing your.

00:35:57.860 --> 00:35:59.140
<v Participant 2>You beginning of the.

00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:06.700
<v Participant 2>Your journey with mine and. And addressing

00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:11.120
<v Participant 2>your benefit. The main reasons for virtually

00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:17.600
<v Participant 2>almost. Maybe 70% of why some. A service

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:22.000
<v Participant 2>member would go to VA for, you know, getting

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:27.920
<v Participant 2>into the system and kind of figuring out

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:31.200
<v Participant 2>what's provided as far as their health care.

00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:36.170
<v Participant 2>So that's good. I mean it just. Then.

00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:41.690
<v Participant 2>Then there's their. The research bar down

00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:45.450
<v Participant 2>there and just in case. Well, in. In case

00:36:47.050 --> 00:36:51.410
<v Participant 2>there is. Other than health care like claims

00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:54.090
<v Participant 2>and travel, whatever.

00:36:55.290 --> 00:37:00.170
<v Participant 2>But those two first two links are the priority.

00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:05.940
<v Participant 1>As far as I know, they're the priority. Okay,

00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:11.860
<v Participant 1>so what is myva is your personal.

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:21.540
<v Participant 2>Personal link. It addresses your profile,

00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:26.180
<v Participant 2>your individual information, your concerns,

00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:32.510
<v Participant 2>your doctor's appointments they should address,

00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:38.750
<v Participant 2>if any. You know, I don't know if it has

00:37:40.830 --> 00:37:45.070
<v Participant 2>your medical whatever. I don't know particularly,

00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:47.150
<v Participant 2>but.

00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:48.390
<v Participant 1>Got it.

00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:50.990
<v Participant 2>Just address you. You personally.

00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:54.080
<v Participant 1>Can you go ahead and click that link for

00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:54.360
<v Participant 1>me?

00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:55.560
<v Participant 2>Yes, sir.

00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:05.360
<v Participant 2>Oh, okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, yeah. Your payments

00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:10.200
<v Participant 2>and if you need co. Pay and yeah.

00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:15.240
<v Participant 2>This pertaining to you personally? Yeah.

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:17.080
<v Participant 1>Your stuff.

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:19.210
<v Participant 2>Your stuff. Yes, sir.

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:23.000
<v Participant 1>Okay. Is this what you were expecting to

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:23.280
<v Participant 1>see?

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:24.320
<v Participant 2>Yes.

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:31.520
<v Participant 2>Okay.

00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:36.880
<v Participant 1>Now one question I have is we're thinking

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:40.680
<v Participant 1>about renaming my va. What. What do you think

00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:43.280
<v Participant 1>about renaming my VA to something else?

00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:52.650
<v Participant 1>Or do you like it as is.

00:38:54.490 --> 00:38:58.090
<v Participant 2>I like it like this. It's mine. It's personal.

00:38:58.170 --> 00:38:58.890
<v Participant 2>Saying my.

00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:02.810
<v Participant 2>So you can't. You can't get. When you can.

00:39:04.090 --> 00:39:06.090
<v Participant 2>But it's still just. It's saying.

00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:09.930
<v Participant 2>Saying mine being personal. You want to do

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:14.300
<v Participant 2>find another simple. A synonym for my go.

00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:18.460
<v Participant 2>You know, be my guest. But as long as it's

00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:21.420
<v Participant 2>saying mine being personal, then you're saying

00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:23.020
<v Participant 2>this is about me.

00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:24.700
<v Participant 1>So this is about me.

00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:25.980
<v Participant 2>Okay.

00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:29.540
<v Participant 1>What about like my VA Dashboard? Does this

00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:31.260
<v Participant 1>feel like a dashboard to you?

00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:38.330
<v Participant 2>Yeah, you could. Yes, sir, it could. Yeah,

00:39:38.330 --> 00:39:40.530
<v Participant 2>it feels like a dashboard. Yes, sir.

00:39:41.650 --> 00:39:43.610
<v Participant 1>The other option I think people are talking

00:39:43.610 --> 00:39:45.570
<v Participant 1>about is my VA homepage.

00:39:49.730 --> 00:39:51.090
<v Participant 1>Is there one that you prefer?

00:39:58.450 --> 00:40:02.530
<v Participant 2>If anything, I will do Dashboard, but because

00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:08.530
<v Participant 2>my VA homepage would feel like probably cause

00:40:08.530 --> 00:40:10.890
<v Participant 2>a whole lot of frustration thinking that

00:40:10.890 --> 00:40:14.170
<v Participant 2>they going to the homepage of va. Whereas,

00:40:14.570 --> 00:40:19.290
<v Participant 2>you know, it's my va. I want the. I want

00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:23.610
<v Participant 2>the government page, not you know, I don't

00:40:23.610 --> 00:40:24.730
<v Participant 2>know. Uhhuh.

00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:25.690
<v Participant 1>I know y.

00:40:28.490 --> 00:40:33.790
<v Participant 2>I keep getting. I won't be a doctor, but

00:40:33.790 --> 00:40:36.950
<v Participant 2>you know, but Dashboard. I prefer Dashboard

00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:39.630
<v Participant 2>if you're gonna do that with. But as I said,

00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:42.990
<v Participant 2>you. It's personal.

00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:46.750
<v Participant 2>My. I feel personally connected to it and

00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:49.150
<v Participant 2>nobody else is.

00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:53.870
<v Participant 1>Got it?

00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:59.800
<v Participant 1>Okay, let's go ahead and click on the screen.

00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:05.960
<v Participant 1>What about Manage Healthcare? What would

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:07.160
<v Participant 1>you expect to be there?

00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:22.600
<v Participant 2>Doctor's appointments, copay claims, upcoming

00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:24.380
<v Participant 2>appointments.

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:37.420
<v Participant 1>Go ahead and click on Manage Your health

00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:38.140
<v Participant 1>care, please.

00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:52.550
<v Participant 1>Maybe you froze. Can you hear me?

00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:12.390
<v Participant 1>Can you hear me?

00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:26.800
<v Participant 1>Raquel? Did you lose her too? Yeah.

00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:34.800
<v Participant 1>Are you reaching out to Parisian?

00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:42.370
<v Participant 1>I don't know. Should I? What do you do? Sometimes

00:42:42.370 --> 00:42:45.730
<v Participant 1>I do depends on how much time we have left.

00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:46.730
<v Participant 1>How much time do we have?

00:42:46.810 --> 00:42:51.610
<v Participant 1>Not actually that much. Let her go. Good

00:42:51.610 --> 00:42:54.250
<v Participant 1>luck. I would say maybe at this point we

00:42:54.250 --> 00:42:56.090
<v Participant 1>just. Because she did actually give us a

00:42:56.090 --> 00:42:57.050
<v Participant 1>lot of information already.

00:42:57.770 --> 00:43:07.340
<v Participant 1>Yeah, she was struggling a little bit with

00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:11.260
<v Participant 1>the tech stuff, so I don't want to make her

00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:18.340
<v Participant 1>figure this out again. Yeah, let's see. But

00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:20.460
<v Participant 1>I would still reach out to Perigian. Is it

00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:23.260
<v Participant 1>Maria? Yeah, I'm chatting her.

00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:26.220
<v Participant 1>Hi, Maria.

00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:32.470
<v Participant 1>It.

00:44:42.090 --> 00:44:43.370
<v Participant 1>She's calling them now.

00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:45.690
<v Participant 2>Okay.

00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:00.580
<v Participant 1>Hi. Can you hear me?

00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:07.300
<v Participant 2>All right. I'm sorry about that.

00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:10.500
<v Participant 1>No, not at all. Don't worry.

00:45:16.430 --> 00:45:18.630
<v Participant 1>I just had a couple last questions as we

00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:19.550
<v Participant 1>wrap up today.

00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:20.830
<v Participant 2>Yes, sir.

00:45:22.350 --> 00:45:24.830
<v Participant 1>Of the two versions you saw, which did you

00:45:24.830 --> 00:45:25.310
<v Participant 1>prefer?

00:45:31.150 --> 00:45:33.750
<v Participant 1>There was the version with the three benefits

00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:34.350
<v Participant 1>listed.

00:45:34.830 --> 00:45:35.870
<v Participant 2>Oh, okay. Okay.

00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:39.350
<v Participant 1>Disability and education. And then there

00:45:39.350 --> 00:45:41.230
<v Participant 1>was the one that was my va.

00:45:41.730 --> 00:45:44.290
<v Participant 1>Manage my health, discover your benefits.

00:45:45.970 --> 00:45:46.930
<v Participant 2>The first one.

00:45:47.250 --> 00:45:49.330
<v Participant 1>The first one. Why did you prefer that one?

00:45:50.450 --> 00:45:54.610
<v Participant 2>It kind of covered most of everything that

00:45:54.930 --> 00:45:56.450
<v Participant 2>I would be concerned with.

00:45:56.770 --> 00:46:03.410
<v Participant 2>And after that, I would then venture on to

00:46:04.130 --> 00:46:08.690
<v Participant 2>set up and create my VA account afterwards.

00:46:08.690 --> 00:46:11.290
<v Participant 2>You know, I can eventually go there, but

00:46:11.450 --> 00:46:17.490
<v Participant 2>just to set up an account and I mean, that

00:46:17.490 --> 00:46:20.930
<v Participant 2>would be a concern. True enough. But I would

00:46:20.930 --> 00:46:23.050
<v Participant 2>more be less. Want to find out what I want

00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:25.730
<v Participant 2>the information that I want to know and then

00:46:25.730 --> 00:46:27.930
<v Participant 2>I will, you know, go.

00:46:27.930 --> 00:46:32.170
<v Participant 2>My next step will be setting up a. My VA

00:46:32.170 --> 00:46:32.570
<v Participant 2>account.

00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:37.340
<v Participant 1>Got it, Got it. So you would prefer the first

00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:40.340
<v Participant 1>one because it would help you with that process.

00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:42.580
<v Participant 2>Yes, sir.

00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:44.340
<v Participant 1>Okay. Okay.

00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:47.300
<v Participant 2>Because you might. They may not want to set

00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:50.580
<v Participant 2>up an account, especially since some. Some,

00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:54.980
<v Participant 2>you know, some are not veterans as it one

00:46:55.220 --> 00:46:59.510
<v Participant 2>particular things said, you know, not if

00:46:59.510 --> 00:47:03.630
<v Participant 2>you're not a veteran, you know, so.

00:47:04.510 --> 00:47:07.870
<v Participant 1>Got it. I'm going to go ahead and share my

00:47:07.870 --> 00:47:08.830
<v Participant 1>screen just to make.

00:47:08.830 --> 00:47:09.790
<v Participant 1>Make it easier.

00:47:10.510 --> 00:47:11.230
<v Participant 2>Uhhuh.

00:47:11.310 --> 00:47:12.990
<v Participant 1>So this is what we were looking at, right.

00:47:12.990 --> 00:47:17.310
<v Participant 1>We saw go to my VA Manage care. Did we?

00:47:17.310 --> 00:47:20.230
<v Participant 1>I, I. Did you get a chance to click on manage

00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:22.750
<v Participant 1>your health care before we cut out?

00:47:23.630 --> 00:47:28.800
<v Participant 2>I. I think I did. It was on the first one.

00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:29.840
<v Participant 2>Is it one of.

00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:33.200
<v Participant 2>One of the ones on the first menu?

00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:36.200
<v Participant 1>It was there on the first menu. Is this.

00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:38.360
<v Participant 1>Would this bring you to the same link or

00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:39.600
<v Participant 1>would it bring you somewhere different?

00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:41.040
<v Participant 2>I don't know.

00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:42.880
<v Participant 2>I mean, I don't know.

00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:45.120
<v Participant 1>Okay. I'm Going to go ahead and click it.

00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:47.280
<v Participant 2>Okay. Because I can't click it.

00:47:50.090 --> 00:47:52.010
<v Participant 1>What do you think about landing here?

00:47:54.650 --> 00:47:57.530
<v Participant 2>Well, here is saying we don't have a VA health

00:47:57.530 --> 00:48:00.330
<v Participant 2>record for you and. Okay.

00:48:03.690 --> 00:48:06.570
<v Participant 2>Okay. I'm scrolling down and I don't see

00:48:06.570 --> 00:48:08.330
<v Participant 2>much. Okay, okay.

00:48:10.650 --> 00:48:11.210
<v Participant 2>Okay.

00:48:14.490 --> 00:48:17.500
<v Participant 2>All right. It's addressing some things that

00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:21.620
<v Participant 2>I, I would be concerned with. Yes, sir. So

00:48:21.620 --> 00:48:22.900
<v Participant 2>I got an 800 number.

00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:25.060
<v Participant 1>Yeah, it's got the 800 number.

00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:28.500
<v Participant 1>We love an 800 number. I know that.

00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:34.780
<v Participant 2>You know, I guess I'm on the 800. Yeah. Come

00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:36.580
<v Participant 2>to her without an 800 number.

00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:41.220
<v Participant 1>Yes. So which, which of those health pages

00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:44.710
<v Participant 1>do you prefer were. We saw this one, my health

00:48:44.710 --> 00:48:47.990
<v Participant 1>event. We also saw another version that I'm

00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:53.230
<v Participant 1>just going to pull up really quickly that

00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:56.070
<v Participant 1>was this one the about VA health benefits.

00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:02.870
<v Participant 1>And just for context, we're thinking back

00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:06.230
<v Participant 1>in the time where we first joined VA.gov.

00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:17.520
<v Participant 2>This one about VA health benefits. This one.

00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:18.720
<v Participant 1>This one?

00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:19.680
<v Participant 2>Yes. Okay.

00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:22.480
<v Participant 1>What about this one do you like more.

00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:26.600
<v Participant 2>It's specific. It's right there. You saying

00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:29.440
<v Participant 2>it. There's no like trying to figure out

00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:32.080
<v Participant 2>you addressing my question.

00:49:33.610 --> 00:49:36.130
<v Participant 1>This is addressing your question. And if

00:49:36.130 --> 00:49:42.250
<v Participant 1>I go to back to this one, is this addressing

00:49:42.250 --> 00:49:50.010
<v Participant 1>your question or why. Why isn't this one

00:49:50.010 --> 00:49:50.970
<v Participant 1>addressing your question?

00:49:54.490 --> 00:50:03.170
<v Participant 2>Because this requires a, A creating a account

00:50:05.570 --> 00:50:09.890
<v Participant 2>and I again might not necessarily want to

00:50:09.890 --> 00:50:12.370
<v Participant 2>create an account and then create an account

00:50:12.610 --> 00:50:15.570
<v Participant 2>necessarily means I have information there

00:50:16.850 --> 00:50:20.770
<v Participant 2>that relative to me because I'm not in the

00:50:20.770 --> 00:50:26.160
<v Participant 2>system but I came in initially for some majority

00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:29.520
<v Participant 2>for information that is concerning me now

00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:34.800
<v Participant 2>and I want that now for me. And then I will

00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:40.520
<v Participant 2>consider going to create account my VA or

00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:46.280
<v Participant 2>my health fee, Viet, whatever. But you just

00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:50.320
<v Participant 2>give me this right here. I mean it had, it

00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:53.100
<v Participant 2>has some, it says you got links in there

00:50:53.100 --> 00:50:56.380
<v Participant 2>get connected to VA mental health and such.

00:50:56.460 --> 00:50:59.660
<v Participant 2>But it kind of makes.

00:51:02.220 --> 00:51:05.740
<v Participant 2>Feels as, it confuses. It confuse you as.

00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:13.100
<v Participant 2>Are you@va.gov or you just, I mean are. Are

00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:17.500
<v Participant 2>you just concerned about your personal VA

00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:20.800
<v Participant 2>and it's. It's called sort of like it's mixing

00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:23.480
<v Participant 2>them and that's just true.

00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:28.280
<v Participant 2>I mean if you can sort that out. But I prefer

00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:35.480
<v Participant 2>to have this and, and well, I guess I'm kind

00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:38.120
<v Participant 2>of. Kind of making, I don't want to make

00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:39.360
<v Participant 2>it confusing, but.

00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:43.600
<v Participant 1>No, no.

00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:47.460
<v Participant 2>Are you, I, Are you trying to try to, to

00:51:47.460 --> 00:51:51.460
<v Participant 2>mail them together va.gov and my health,

00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:53.140
<v Participant 2>all those issues into one?

00:51:55.060 --> 00:51:56.900
<v Participant 1>Well, I just want to know what you think

00:51:56.980 --> 00:52:00.780
<v Participant 1>would be easier for you when you first come

00:52:00.780 --> 00:52:04.740
<v Participant 1>here. Would you if you'd Rather see the page

00:52:04.740 --> 00:52:07.380
<v Participant 1>about. Or if you'd rather see this page.

00:52:07.620 --> 00:52:08.900
<v Participant 1>The My Healthy Vet.

00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:11.300
<v Participant 2>No, I don't want that one.

00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:12.980
<v Participant 1>You want the about page.

00:52:13.470 --> 00:52:15.190
<v Participant 2>I would like to. About my.

00:52:15.190 --> 00:52:19.390
<v Participant 2>Welcome to va.gov and then eventually I was.

00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:26.990
<v Participant 2>I would say if. Then allow me to create a

00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:28.430
<v Participant 2>My VA page.

00:52:30.670 --> 00:52:32.510
<v Participant 2>And then from there.

<v Participant 1>Got it.

00:52:39.670 --> 00:52:42.110
<v Participant 1>would you expect under discover your benefits?

<v Participant 2>Any and everything that the VA Government.

00:52:48.050 --> 00:52:52.610

<v Participant 2>And things that we're not aware of.

00:53:00.690 --> 00:53:07.730

<v Participant 2>us to the myriads of possibilities and connected

00:53:19.630 --> 00:53:30.790
<v Participant 2>to our specific training or support group

<v Participant 2>something else within that field that they
