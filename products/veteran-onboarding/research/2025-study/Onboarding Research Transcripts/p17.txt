WEBVTT

00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.800
<v Participant 1>That and I've started the recording. I'd

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.000
<v Participant 1>like to confirm. Are you comfortable if I

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.680
<v Participant 1>record my screen and the audio as we talk

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:11.040
<v Participant 1>today?

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.320
<v Participant 2>Yes, I am.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.000
<v Participant 1>Okay, great.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.400
<v Participant 1>Okay, so before we look at the website, just

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.320
<v Participant 1>some questions to start us off. What state

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.200
<v Participant 1>are you calling from? Just California.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:26.210
<v Participant 2>California.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.850
<v Participant 1>Oh, so it's early morning for you.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.650
<v Participant 2>Yeah, yeah. It actually worked out, though,

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.170
<v Participant 2>with my work schedule, because this is right

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.570
<v Participant 2>before I have to get to work, so.

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.930
<v Participant 1>Oh, okay. Well, I appreciate you waking up

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:35.570
<v Participant 1>early. I'm.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.690
<v Participant 2>I'm on the little early side.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.210
<v Participant 1>Like, I'm in Colorado right now.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.730
<v Participant 2>Okay.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.530
<v Participant 1>Yeah, not too bad.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:42.330
<v Participant 2>Yeah.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.170
<v Participant 1>How's the weather in California?

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.690
<v Participant 2>Good. It's. I live in the Bay Area, so it's

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.850
<v Participant 2>foggy this time of day, and then we're getting

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.770
<v Participant 2>some rain tomorrow, but I'm looking forward

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.050
<v Participant 2>to that, so it's good.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.270
<v Participant 1>Oh, that's good.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.150
<v Participant 1>Yeah. Yeah. Has fun weather.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:57.110
<v Participant 2>Yeah.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:58.710
<v Participant 1>So interesting.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.190
<v Participant 1>Cool. Well, what branch of service did you

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.710
<v Participant 1>serve in?

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.070
<v Participant 2>I was in the Air Force.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.430
<v Participant 1>In the Air Force. Okay.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.870
<v Participant 1>And when did you transition out?

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.230
<v Participant 2>Thinking of it the other day because I can't

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.590
<v Participant 2>believe it's been this long already, but

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.070
<v Participant 2>I believe it was like 29, end of 2019. So

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.390
<v Participant 2>like September, I think.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.030
<v Participant 1>September 2019. Okay.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.270
<v Participant 1>Okay. And when did you create your first

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.510
<v Participant 1>va.gov account?

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.550
<v Participant 2>I'm guessing it would have been 2020. Yeah,

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.350
<v Participant 2>it was. I don't know if it was as quick as

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.910
<v Participant 2>19, but it was probably early 2020.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.870
<v Participant 1>Okay, and do you recall why you created.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.110
<v Participant 2>It Just kind of felt like part of the process

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.950
<v Participant 2>of getting out.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.070
<v Participant 2>You know, I knew I'd worked for the va, like,

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.700
<v Participant 2>well, its relative. So I was an intern there

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.380
<v Participant 2>for, you know, during school years and years

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.940
<v Participant 2>ago and for a few months. And so I. I was

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.260
<v Participant 2>familiar with what they were. Obviously I

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:01.900
<v Participant 2>knew about them while I was active, and I

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.620
<v Participant 2>think it was part of my transition out. They

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.940
<v Participant 2>were like, hey, you know, you should talk

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.460
<v Participant 2>to them for coverage and whatever.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.660
<v Participant 2>So, yeah, it was just kind of like part of

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.260
<v Participant 2>getting assessed and care and all that.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.100
<v Participant 1>Got it. Got it. Was there any specific benefit

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.400
<v Participant 1>you were, like, hoping to get or like, you

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.800
<v Participant 1>kind of mentioned care or something else?

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.000
<v Participant 2>I think it might have been mostly prompted

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.320
<v Participant 2>by.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.200
<v Participant 2>I was diagnosed with sleep apnea while I

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.840
<v Participant 2>was in the Air Force. And, you know, it's.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.280
<v Participant 2>I don't know how familiar you are, but you

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.640
<v Participant 2>need like, the recurring supplies and so

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.960
<v Participant 2>because I didn't know if my private insurance

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.320
<v Participant 2>or my normal insurance would cover it or.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.360
<v Participant 2>Or to what extent and what Cost. I was like,

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.960
<v Participant 2>all right, let's.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.000
<v Participant 2>Let's let them do it. So I think that was

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.400
<v Participant 2>really what prompted me. And there was, like,

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.120
<v Participant 2>it was kind of time sensitive because I needed

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.760
<v Participant 2>to get the machine and I needed to get that

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.040
<v Participant 2>going.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.200
<v Participant 1>Got it. So it was.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.960
<v Participant 1>It was like these health medical equipment

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.880
<v Participant 1>items.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.440
<v Participant 2>Exactly that. Yeah, yeah.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.080
<v Participant 1>Okay. Okay.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.640
<v Participant 1>Got it, got it. Do you recall if you made

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.160
<v Participant 1>the account on your own or with, like, this

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.990
<v Participant 1>support of a VSO or someone, a representative?

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.470
<v Participant 2>It would have been on my own. Yeah. I didn't.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.150
<v Participant 2>I don't even know that. I was super familiar

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.190
<v Participant 2>with VSOs then.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.990
<v Participant 1>Okay, okay. And how was the. I mean, this

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.710
<v Participant 1>is a hard question.

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.270
<v Participant 1>How. How was that process for you, if you

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:33.030
<v Participant 1>can remember?

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.070
<v Participant 2>I mean, I don't remember it being challenging.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.630
<v Participant 2>So I would say pretty straightforward. I'm.

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.780
<v Participant 2>I mean, I'm. I don't know. I don't struggle

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.780
<v Participant 2>with that sort of thing typically. So it

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.780
<v Participant 2>was. It didn't stand out as being an issue.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.020
<v Participant 1>Okay, it didn't stand out as being an issue.

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.660
<v Participant 2>Yeah.

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:50.540
<v Participant 1>It's good to hear.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.420
<v Participant 1>Okay. And are there. Are there other benefits

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.620
<v Participant 1>that you were able to access since, you know,

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:01.260
<v Participant 1>2020?

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.900
<v Participant 2>Yeah, I mean, you know, so I'm assuming we're

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.180
<v Participant 2>talking the whole thing. So messaging for

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.780
<v Participant 2>patient care has been.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.960
<v Participant 2>I mean, that's frequent. Ish.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.320
<v Participant 2>Checking my records, like, my medical records,

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.280
<v Participant 2>checking. Getting, like, proof of service

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.960
<v Participant 2>stuff through the va, and then also, like,

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.880
<v Participant 2>the disability compensation stuff, like the

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.320
<v Participant 2>compensation, pension, whatever they call

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.240
<v Participant 2>it, because all that's kind of weaved together.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.920
<v Participant 2>So pretty much all of that, I believe, is

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.080
<v Participant 2>all through the VA website. It's been easy

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.360
<v Participant 2>enough.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.200
<v Participant 1>Great, great.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.410
<v Participant 1>Glad it's been easy for you. Yeah. Is there

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.730
<v Participant 1>anything that would have been helpful to

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.010
<v Participant 1>you when you first went to va.gov?

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.770
<v Participant 2>I mean, I don't remember the specifics of

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.530
<v Participant 2>what was challenging, and I'm sure there

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:53.130
<v Participant 2>was something.

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.290
<v Participant 2>Hmm. I don't. I don't really think so. I

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.370
<v Participant 2>mean, you know what still bothers me, and

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.330
<v Participant 2>I think they're trying to fix it, is like.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.370
<v Participant 2>And I imagine for certain people it could

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.970
<v Participant 2>be more of a challenge is the logins.

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.850
<v Participant 2>Like, when you go to log in, it's like, do

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.850
<v Participant 2>you want to log in through one of these four

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:18.410
<v Participant 2>ways? And it's like, yeah. And I mean, you

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.090
<v Participant 2>know, I. I recognize I have options there.

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.370
<v Participant 2>It's fine. But then part of me, every time

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.330
<v Participant 2>I log, go to login, even now, is like, wait,

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:27.330
<v Participant 2>which one do I want?

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.930
<v Participant 2>And, like, if I pick the wrong one, is that

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.850
<v Participant 2>going to like make me have to make like.

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:33.210
<v Participant 2>Is that going to make me need to link it

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.650
<v Participant 2>to my existing account? So it's just an extra

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.030
<v Participant 2>thought. I wouldn't change it because it

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.150
<v Participant 2>realistically, it just gives the person more

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:41.390
<v Participant 2>options. But it's.

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:43.190
<v Participant 2>I don't know. I don't know how it could be

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:44.830
<v Participant 2>streamlined, but that's always a little bit

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:45.510
<v Participant 2>off putting.

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:50.270
<v Participant 1>I guess that I completely hear you. Yep,

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.190
<v Participant 1>that makes sense. Okay, well, great.

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:56.350
<v Participant 1>I think we're going to move on to the next

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:59.150
<v Participant 1>part of our session now where I'm sure with

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:03.150
<v Participant 1>you, a prototype so kind of is a website,

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.490
<v Participant 1>but. Exactly.

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:16.610
<v Participant 1>Let's go ahead and share the link.

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:25.330
<v Participant 1>Okay, so I'm sending you a link in chat now.

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:26.890
<v Participant 2>Let me see if I can get.

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:27.610
<v Participant 1>To it up there.

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:28.290
<v Participant 2>I see that.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:34.620
<v Participant 2>All right. You can still see and hear me,

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.860
<v Participant 2>right? Yes. Okay, so just minimize.

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:38.220
<v Participant 1>So.

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:38.940
<v Participant 2>Oh yeah.

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.980
<v Participant 1>If you could pull this link up and share

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.020
<v Participant 1>your screen with me, that would be perfect.

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.660
<v Participant 2>Okay, let's see if I can do that.

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:49.340
<v Participant 2>Hang on one second.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:53.900
<v Participant 2>Okay.

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:14.630
<v Participant 2>Oh, to share. I'm staring right at it.

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:21.920
<v Participant 2>Okay.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.120
<v Participant 2>All right. Can you see it?

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.400
<v Participant 1>Yeah, I can see it. Looks good. Okay, perfect.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.280
<v Participant 1>So now I want to kind of like. Yeah. As Megan

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:46.880
<v Participant 1>kind of brought up, go back to 2019, 2020.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.320
<v Participant 1>And you're. You're here for the first time

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.160
<v Participant 1>and you want to make an account and, and

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:55.440
<v Participant 1>whatever you came here to get, let's kind

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:56.760
<v Participant 1>of just walk through that process.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:01.680
<v Participant 2>Okay. You know, you just talk while I do

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.240
<v Participant 2>it. Like to say what I'm thinking.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.280
<v Participant 1>Absolutely. If you can think aloud, that

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:05.880
<v Participant 1>would make this.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:06.999
<v Participant 1>Okay, great.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:09.920
<v Participant 2>Well, now I would sign in, but I'm not doing

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.480
<v Participant 2>that because this is the first time. So I

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.240
<v Participant 2>would click create an account. Will it do

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.760
<v Participant 2>that if I click it? I mean, not literally.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.200
<v Participant 2>I know it won't make a new account, but if

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.640
<v Participant 2>I click this link. Is that what you want

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:21.120
<v Participant 2>me to do?

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.640
<v Participant 1>Yeah, yeah, you can go ahead and do that.

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:24.240
<v Participant 1>That's fine.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.600
<v Participant 2>Okay, here's the.

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:29.920
<v Participant 2>So only two options. That's not so bad. Yeah,

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:36.600
<v Participant 2>so I mean, here, other sign in options. So

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.320
<v Participant 2>I mean, what I think I've always done. I

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.200
<v Participant 2>mean now I, I pick the top option because

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:42.560
<v Participant 2>I just.

00:08:42.899 --> 00:08:45.139
<v Participant 2>No, that's the one I do. But if I was doing

00:08:45.139 --> 00:08:47.179
<v Participant 2>this for the first time, I don't remember

00:08:47.179 --> 00:08:50.899
<v Participant 2>if at the time I had a login.gov or an ID.

00:08:50.979 --> 00:08:53.619
<v Participant 2>It probably had ID me from when I was active

00:08:53.619 --> 00:08:55.499
<v Participant 2>just because there was some things I think

00:08:55.499 --> 00:08:57.619
<v Participant 2>it was connected to. So anyways, I'm familiar

00:08:57.619 --> 00:08:59.099
<v Participant 2>with. At least ID me.

00:08:59.099 --> 00:09:01.659
<v Participant 2>So I'd click that. Well, sign in. Yeah, sign

00:09:01.659 --> 00:09:06.339
<v Participant 2>in or create welcome to va. Oh, okay. Well,

00:09:07.699 --> 00:09:09.890
<v Participant 2>I mean, I would have clicked that. I would

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:13.490
<v Participant 2>have presumably put in my credentials at

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:13.810
<v Participant 2>this point.

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:15.210
<v Participant 2>I mean, I don't know what you. Because it

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:17.050
<v Participant 2>seems like it's saying I'm logged in now,

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:20.690
<v Participant 2>so I guess I just go to my va. Is that all

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:20.970
<v Participant 2>right?

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:24.650
<v Participant 1>Well, let's stay here for a moment. Okay.

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:27.330
<v Participant 1>Tell me, what are your immediate thoughts

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:29.770
<v Participant 1>on this kind of white pop up?

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:32.490
<v Participant 2>Well, it's a little confused. I mean, again,

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:34.900
<v Participant 2>I know this is a demo thing. It's not really

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:36.370
<v Participant 2>real what it would look like, presumably,

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:38.290
<v Participant 2>but it's a little confusing that I went from

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:41.610
<v Participant 2>click here to login to you're logged in.

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:45.050
<v Participant 2>So. But I think that's more of just the thing

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:45.850
<v Participant 2>we're doing here.

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:49.130
<v Participant 2>I think it's an artifact of this example

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:51.050
<v Participant 2>we're doing. I would have assumed that I

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:52.770
<v Participant 2>would have clicked that and then it would

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:54.650
<v Participant 2>have either given me a prompt to put in my

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:58.330
<v Participant 2>username and password, like everything, or

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:02.130
<v Participant 2>take me to. I don't remember the first time

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:04.650
<v Participant 2>I did ID me, but take me to. What is your

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:07.600
<v Participant 2>name, probably service history, things like

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.480
<v Participant 2>that, to then look you up and make an account.

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:11.720
<v Participant 2>So the fact that it went straight from click

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:15.280
<v Participant 2>ID me to I'm logged in, welcome to the va.

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:15.480
<v Participant 2>That.

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.720
<v Participant 2>That feels like we skipped a step. But again,

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:20.480
<v Participant 2>I think that's just part of this thing we're

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:21.240
<v Participant 2>doing. That.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.160
<v Participant 1>Yeah, it's definitely baked into the prototype

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.480
<v Participant 1>not to, you know, go through that whole login.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.000
<v Participant 1>Yeah, you kind of mentioned.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.640
<v Participant 2>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So. So to answer

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.320
<v Participant 2>your question, this is fine. I mean, this.

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:32.610
<v Participant 2>This is straightforward.

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:36.570
<v Participant 2>I mean, go to my va, I would assume. I mean,

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:39.410
<v Participant 2>I guess I would assume that that would be

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:42.490
<v Participant 2>for, like, disability and whatever other

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:44.970
<v Participant 2>things that you have available to you. And

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:47.010
<v Participant 2>then healthcare would be obviously like messaging

00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:49.090
<v Participant 2>your doctors, making appointments, et cetera.

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:51.290
<v Participant 2>Discovering your benefits would be just that.

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:53.690
<v Participant 2>I mean, it seems like maybe discover your

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:55.530
<v Participant 2>benefits would be under the va, Go to my

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:57.330
<v Participant 2>va, you know, as like a tab.

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.760
<v Participant 2>But maybe it's helping, like new veterans

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.600
<v Participant 2>to say, hey, before you get started with

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.880
<v Participant 2>everything, discover your benefits, which

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.520
<v Participant 2>maybe it could be at the top of the list

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:06.160
<v Participant 2>then.

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.560
<v Participant 1>Could be at the top of those. Okay, well,

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.120
<v Participant 1>yeah, say more about it being at the top

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:10.720
<v Participant 1>of the list.

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.960
<v Participant 2>Well, I assume the benefits are under the

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.320
<v Participant 2>my VA button. You know, like, if I click

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.480
<v Participant 2>my go to my va, I'd assume that's where My

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:22.200
<v Participant 2>benefits, or like, signing up for benefits,

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:22.720
<v Participant 2>etc.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.550
<v Participant 2>Would be held. And so if. If it's not its

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:27.830
<v Participant 2>own separate thing, it seems like you're

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:29.710
<v Participant 2>just trying to draw my attention to it as

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:31.990
<v Participant 2>a theoretically a new veteran looking at

00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:36.030
<v Participant 2>this. And so having, like, discover your

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:38.310
<v Participant 2>benefits, it's almost like a tutorial, right?

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:40.830
<v Participant 2>Like at the beginning of a game or of a,

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:42.790
<v Participant 2>you know, like a whatever, I don't know,

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:43.070
<v Participant 2>experience.

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:45.630
<v Participant 2>And so maybe having it at the top, like,

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:47.390
<v Participant 2>take a tour of your benefits or something

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:49.510
<v Participant 2>like that, you know, and then under that,

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:51.270
<v Participant 2>if a person already knows what they're doing,

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:54.830
<v Participant 2>go to my va, manage healthcare as separate

00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:55.150
<v Participant 2>things.

00:11:56.590 --> 00:12:00.910
<v Participant 1>Got it. Okay. What is my VA to you? How would

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:02.190
<v Participant 1>you kind of describe it?

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:04.790
<v Participant 2>I mean, I would think of it as the whole

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:06.550
<v Participant 2>website. Like, when I think of that, I think

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:09.589
<v Participant 2>of it as basically interchangeable with,

00:12:09.589 --> 00:12:12.550
<v Participant 2>like, va.gov account as it says, you verified

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:16.230
<v Participant 2>me there. And so it feels like the managed

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:19.800
<v Participant 2>healthcare is kind of under the. My VA as

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.680
<v Participant 2>well. So there's my va, and then under that

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.720
<v Participant 2>is like benefits, healthcare, blah, blah,

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:25.080
<v Participant 2>blah.

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:28.400
<v Participant 2>So I just think of it as the VA page for

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:28.720
<v Participant 2>me.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.920
<v Participant 1>Got it. The VA page for you. All of. All

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:34.440
<v Participant 1>of your VA stuff.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:37.800
<v Participant 2>Yeah, exactly. Okay. And then manage your

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:38.400
<v Participant 2>health care.

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.360
<v Participant 1>You kind of mentioned that it would be like

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.720
<v Participant 1>us. Is that a subset of my ba.

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:47.700
<v Participant 2>The way I picture my va? Yeah, I mean, like,

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:51.260
<v Participant 2>if I think of like, you know, Gmail for Google

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.340
<v Participant 2>as like the thing, the main thing. And then

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:55.740
<v Participant 2>under that is like all the things Gmail does.

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.020
<v Participant 2>I think of like, my VA is the big thing.

00:12:58.020 --> 00:12:59.740
<v Participant 2>And then under that is like managing your

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:01.940
<v Participant 2>health care benefits, et cetera, et cetera.

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:05.300
<v Participant 2>So. So yeah, and then in managing my healthcare,

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:06.740
<v Participant 2>like I said, I'd be able to look at my medical

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:08.660
<v Participant 2>records, I'd be able to message my providers,

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:11.500
<v Participant 2>make appointments, see results, whatever.

00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:16.890
<v Participant 1>Got it, Got it. Okay. And then, so tell me

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:19.370
<v Participant 1>about the text that you're reading, like,

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:21.450
<v Participant 1>from we verify VR account.

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:27.849
<v Participant 2>It's just saying that it's verified it's

00:13:27.849 --> 00:13:31.130
<v Participant 2>me. Well, we verify your account. I mean,

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:33.450
<v Participant 2>I guess that would be like you logged in

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:37.210
<v Participant 2>for the first time we verified it. Kind of,

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:39.810
<v Participant 2>to me implies the first time we verified

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:40.490
<v Participant 2>it. You're here.

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:43.520
<v Participant 2>Welcome. You can now start exploring your

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:45.470
<v Participant 2>benefits so you can do stuff online with

00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:47.910
<v Participant 2>your VA account. And then what would you

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:49.950
<v Participant 2>like to do first? Which kind of is what we

00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:51.790
<v Participant 2>got at. You know, what each one of those

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:52.630
<v Participant 2>buttons would do.

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:54.950
<v Participant 1>Got it.

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:55.270
<v Participant 2>Got it.

00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:58.790
<v Participant 1>We verified. Okay, so let's go ahead. And

00:13:59.510 --> 00:13:59.950
<v Participant 1>which One.

00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:01.350
<v Participant 1>Would you want to click first?

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:06.110
<v Participant 2>The first one. I guess I can go to my.

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:08.230
<v Participant 1>Va. Sure, let's go ahead and do that.

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:09.110
<v Participant 2>Okay.

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:11.540
<v Participant 2>All right.

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:17.300
<v Participant 1>So, yeah, tell me about what you're thinking

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:18.340
<v Participant 1>on this page.

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:25.100
<v Participant 2>I mean, my first reaction is it feels a little

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:27.620
<v Participant 2>incomplete. Like just from a design standpoint.

00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:29.660
<v Participant 2>Like it almost feels like, you know, if a

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:31.780
<v Participant 2>website doesn't load fully and so it's just

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:35.300
<v Participant 2>like text on a background, it feels like.

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:37.010
<v Participant 2>And I don't. I don't need to be busy, but

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:38.930
<v Participant 2>it's like in the blue section of the page

00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:40.570
<v Participant 2>that looks complete, you know, there's like

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:44.090
<v Participant 2>the logo dropdowns design down here.

00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:45.770
<v Participant 2>It almost looks. I don't know, it looks very

00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:48.810
<v Participant 2>sterile. That's just a aesthetic preference,

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:51.570
<v Participant 2>I guess. Otherwise it's what I thought it

00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:53.090
<v Participant 2>was. Which is like my va.

00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:56.250
<v Participant 2>Your profile, which is who I am. Presumably

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:58.970
<v Participant 2>my, you know, information claims and appeals

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:00.970
<v Participant 2>is like the disability compensation stuff.

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:03.650
<v Participant 2>You know, filing one, checking on it, etc.

00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:06.660
<v Participant 2>Disability rating, again, it's the rating

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:09.300
<v Participant 2>of your disability from your service. They

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:11.500
<v Participant 2>don't have a record of the rating for this

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:11.820
<v Participant 2>person.

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:15.140
<v Participant 2>If I wanted to look at the rating for me

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:17.500
<v Participant 2>in this situation, I could click the review

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:21.900
<v Participant 2>Disability rating information forms and applications.

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:24.500
<v Participant 2>I don't know what exactly would be like a

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:26.700
<v Participant 2>form in this context. I would think that

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:29.020
<v Participant 2>kind of makes me think of the disability

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:31.020
<v Participant 2>stuff. But since it's separate from that,

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:33.270
<v Participant 2>I don't know, I'm not sure what that would

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:37.590
<v Participant 2>be. I mean, it says benefit forms, so it's

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:40.670
<v Participant 2>a little confusing, I guess, because it feels

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:42.510
<v Participant 2>like some of that should be under claims

00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:44.070
<v Participant 2>and appeals because it says you don't have

00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:45.790
<v Participant 2>any completed benefit forms, which to me

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:47.950
<v Participant 2>is like disability benefits, which should

00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:49.670
<v Participant 2>be under that previous heading.

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:51.670
<v Participant 2>So maybe it should be like claims and appeals

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:54.710
<v Participant 2>or like disability or disability rating.

00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:56.750
<v Participant 2>And then under that is like, sorry, my dog

00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:58.150
<v Participant 2>is making noise.

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:02.830
<v Participant 2>Anyways, under that probably could be if.

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:05.510
<v Participant 2>If the only kinds of forms and applications

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:07.830
<v Participant 2>are for disability, which maybe they're not

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:11.790
<v Participant 2>healthcare, it's health information. So my

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:15.590
<v Participant 2>healthy vet I know is the like VA health

00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:16.470
<v Participant 2>section.

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:21.670
<v Participant 2>Benefit payments. I mean, that makes sense

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:23.190
<v Participant 2>to have it in a separate section, I guess,

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:25.940
<v Participant 2>you know, like having the money bit separate

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:30.140
<v Participant 2>from the. The other bit. Again, it's a little

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:32.580
<v Participant 2>redundant because benefit payments is related

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:35.580
<v Participant 2>to claims and appeals in a way, but I think

00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:37.220
<v Participant 2>that's more like permanent. So like once

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:38.020
<v Participant 2>you've got your.

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:41.780
<v Participant 2>I don't know, because disability rating is

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:45.060
<v Participant 2>your rating too. That's like there. So anyways,

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:47.100
<v Participant 2>I'll not overthink it. So that's just like

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:49.060
<v Participant 2>the money you're getting, the money you're

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:51.140
<v Participant 2>paying for coverage, etc.

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:56.260
<v Participant 1>Okay. So did this page align with your expectations?

00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:59.900
<v Participant 2>Yeah, yeah. It's about what I think of when

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:00.900
<v Participant 2>I think of this area.

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:01.860
<v Participant 1>Okay.

00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:04.340
<v Participant 1>And, you know, getting back into that mindset

00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:09.660
<v Participant 1>of being a New Veteran on VA.gov is this

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:11.140
<v Participant 1>page useful to you?

00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:14.220
<v Participant 2>Yeah, I mean, if I was here for healthcare

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:16.700
<v Participant 2>or ratings, whatever disability, I. I could

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:18.930
<v Participant 2>pretty easily track down what I need.

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:27.250
<v Participant 1>Okay, let's go ahead and click back on the

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:28.370
<v Participant 1>screen, like, anywhere.

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:30.050
<v Participant 2>Okay.

00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:32.210
<v Participant 1>And let's go to the second one.

00:17:33.729 --> 00:17:34.210
<v Participant 2>All right.

00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:36.450
<v Participant 1>Yeah.

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:44.790
<v Participant 2>You want to. Want me to tell you what I think

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:45.190
<v Participant 2>of it?

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:46.550
<v Participant 1>Yes, please. Yeah.

00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:47.030
<v Participant 2>Okay.

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:50.470
<v Participant 2>So I know my Healthy Vet is like the. I don't

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:52.630
<v Participant 2>know, it's like the VA branded, like, health

00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:56.190
<v Participant 2>arm of the website. I. I do sometimes get

00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:58.270
<v Participant 2>a little. And this is again, maybe more than

00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:00.430
<v Participant 2>we care, but I do get a little bit confused

00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:03.590
<v Participant 2>or like, like, what is my healthevet versus

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:06.430
<v Participant 2>my VA versus whatever they're calling the

00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:08.110
<v Participant 2>disability section, if that's a different

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:10.930
<v Participant 2>thing. So, you know, like, I know my Healthy

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:13.450
<v Participant 2>Vet was also a login, going back to my login

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:13.970
<v Participant 2>complaint.

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:16.330
<v Participant 2>So I don't know, it just feels like there's

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:18.370
<v Participant 2>a bunch of different things. And I'm. If

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:20.290
<v Participant 2>somebody says, go to your VA thing, I'm like,

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:22.370
<v Participant 2>you want my healthy vet? Do you want my va?

00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:22.810
<v Participant 2>Do you want.

00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:26.050
<v Participant 2>You know, it's just a lot. So. All right.

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:29.490
<v Participant 2>So you can manage your benefits and services?

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:30.010
<v Participant 2>Yep.

00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:31.410
<v Participant 2>So it's just telling me I can do everything

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:34.050
<v Participant 2>here, telling me I don't have any records.

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:37.180
<v Participant 2>If I think that that's wrong, I can call

00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:40.700
<v Participant 2>them. I can contact for mental health services,

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:43.740
<v Participant 2>get benefits. So just links to, like, getting

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:46.580
<v Participant 2>services, essentially. And then I presume

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:48.060
<v Participant 2>this is all downloading my data.

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:51.780
<v Participant 2>Yeah, so down. Sorry. Downloading my health

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:54.700
<v Participant 2>information, my medical record, and then

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:58.020
<v Participant 2>I guess. Yeah, so I guess my military service

00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:02.250
<v Participant 2>data. So I don't know if that's health medical

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:05.410
<v Participant 2>record data or if that's like, when you served,

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:06.530
<v Participant 2>what you did, all that.

00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:08.730
<v Participant 2>I'm not sure which one that is. But anyways,

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:10.530
<v Participant 2>it's something to do for my military.

00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:15.650
<v Participant 1>Got it. So did this page align with your

00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:16.450
<v Participant 1>expectations?

00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:19.170
<v Participant 2>Yeah, it's like the last one pretty much.

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:22.730
<v Participant 1>Okay. And yeah, again, same thing going back

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:24.890
<v Participant 1>to when you were a new vet, a new veteran

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:26.210
<v Participant 1>on va.gov.

00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:28.050
<v Participant 1>would this have been helpful for you?

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:31.290
<v Participant 2>Yeah, yeah. It may have looked like this

00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:33.410
<v Participant 2>for all I remember, but Yeah, I mean, I,

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:35.090
<v Participant 2>I could have gotten where I needed to get.

00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:37.890
<v Participant 2>Yeah. I mean I.

00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:39.650
<v Participant 2>If I was looking for benefits, I was looking

00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:43.010
<v Participant 2>for, you know. Well, yeah, Healthcare. Yeah.

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:45.290
<v Participant 2>So yeah, regardless of what I wanted, everything

00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:47.130
<v Participant 2>I think I could have either gotten on this

00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:49.010
<v Participant 2>page or gotten two from this page.

00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:53.970
<v Participant 1>Got it, got it. Okay, feel free to click

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:55.640
<v Participant 1>anywhere else on the screen.

00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:58.200
<v Participant 2>Okay.

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:01.960
<v Participant 1>And let's do the last one.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:03.560
<v Participant 2>Okay.

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:06.000
<v Participant 1>And yeah, again, if you could like think

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.240
<v Participant 1>aloud as you. Sure, that would be very helpful.

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:13.960
<v Participant 2>I always like just generally any sort of

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:16.920
<v Participant 2>a application process that gives me like

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:18.920
<v Participant 2>little progress bar at the top that kind

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.600
<v Participant 2>of scratches a part of my brain about like

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:23.280
<v Participant 2>this is how long it's going to take, this

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:25.160
<v Participant 2>is how far along you are. So I like the little

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:30.040
<v Participant 2>blue progress thingy at the top here even,

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:33.520
<v Participant 2>even more than one of six goals. Like it's

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:34.120
<v Participant 2>the same thing.

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:36.200
<v Participant 2>But I just, I don't know, seeing it visually

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:38.600
<v Participant 2>that way is just, you know, something works

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:39.000
<v Participant 2>for me.

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:43.240
<v Participant 2>I like that. You know, so like thinking about

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:45.160
<v Participant 2>what is your objective for being here?

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:51.250
<v Participant 2>Financial support. Yeah, I mean that first

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:53.210
<v Participant 2>one, give financial support for a service

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:54.210
<v Participant 2>connected condition.

00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:59.170
<v Participant 2>I might use like a hot word in there like,

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:01.530
<v Participant 2>about like disability rating, you know, just

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:03.890
<v Participant 2>because I'm assuming that's what that means.

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:06.610
<v Participant 2>But if I was like coming in here to like

00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:09.330
<v Participant 2>apply for benefits, that is literally what

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:11.570
<v Participant 2>a disability rating is meant for in terms

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:14.100
<v Participant 2>of the financial side. But might be nice

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:16.140
<v Participant 2>to see those words there just to know that's

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:16.860
<v Participant 2>what that's doing.

00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:20.500
<v Participant 1>But otherwise, is that like the word you're

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:21.180
<v Participant 1>looking for?

00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:23.580
<v Participant 2>That's just what everybody.

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:25.300
<v Participant 2>I mean, I don't know. It's just my knowledge

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:27.300
<v Participant 2>of like that stuff. It's like disability

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:29.420
<v Participant 2>rating is like, it's the thing that unlocks

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:31.460
<v Participant 2>everything else in terms of finances, in

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:34.460
<v Participant 2>terms of benefits, in terms of like healthcare.

00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:38.380
<v Participant 2>And so like, if, if that button helps me

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:41.020
<v Participant 2>to like get to I. Applying for disability

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:43.100
<v Participant 2>essentially or changing your rating or something,

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:45.420
<v Participant 2>I feel like those words probably could be

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:45.740
<v Participant 2>there.

00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:49.980
<v Participant 2>I also think like a little bit more clear

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:52.436
<v Participant 2>about like that. What is that? 1, 2, 3, 4,

00:21:52.484 --> 00:21:54.460
<v Participant 2>5, 5th 1. Take care of my health and well

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:57.020
<v Participant 2>being. I'm assuming that's like applying

00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:57.260
<v Participant 2>for.

00:21:57.260 --> 00:21:59.220
<v Participant 2>I don't know how far along this is in the

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:01.420
<v Participant 2>like process of getting coverage. But like,

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:03.540
<v Participant 2>I'm assuming that's like applying for health

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:06.930
<v Participant 2>care, in which case, I don't know. I mean,

00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:09.090
<v Participant 2>again, that's literally what I'm doing. I'm

00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:10.610
<v Participant 2>trying to take care of my health. But it

00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:14.250
<v Participant 2>might be nice if it was just clear like take

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:16.010
<v Participant 2>care of my health and well being by applying

00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:17.850
<v Participant 2>for health care or something, you know, something

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:18.370
<v Participant 2>like that.

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:22.730
<v Participant 1>Okay, so you're, you're kind of. I'm understanding.

00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:24.450
<v Participant 1>And please correct me if I'm misinterpreting.

00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:27.610
<v Participant 1>You're looking for these labels to have the

00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:30.530
<v Participant 1>specific benefits kind of listed out.

00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:32.490
<v Participant 2>Because I don't know.

00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:34.050
<v Participant 2>Yeah, I mean, I don't know if that take care

00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:36.050
<v Participant 2>of my health. That could be like, you know,

00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:40.730
<v Participant 2>like get nutrition suggestions or you know,

00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:43.170
<v Participant 2>find gyms in your area. You know, like, I

00:22:43.170 --> 00:22:44.570
<v Participant 2>don't know what take care of my health and

00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:47.610
<v Participant 2>well being is, but if, if what that's supposed

00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:51.130
<v Participant 2>to do is like, again, my benefits, I assume

00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:53.450
<v Participant 2>this is about applying for benefits. I'm

00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:56.490
<v Participant 2>not sure, maybe I'm wrong, but I just feel

00:22:56.490 --> 00:22:59.690
<v Participant 2>like maybe like saying that, like apply for

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:01.780
<v Participant 2>VA health care to take care of your health

00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:03.420
<v Participant 2>and well being or something, you know, just

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:04.780
<v Participant 2>being very clear about that.

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:08.540
<v Participant 1>So this is not clear in your opinion?

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:12.540
<v Participant 2>I mean, I'm pretty sure I know what each

00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:15.140
<v Participant 2>of these would do if I click them, but I

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:17.020
<v Participant 2>think it could be more clear from my part.

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:21.340
<v Participant 1>Got it, got it. Okay. Okay, great. Let's

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:23.260
<v Participant 1>go ahead and click on the screen.

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:25.020
<v Participant 2>Okay.

00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:28.970
<v Participant 1>Having kind of gone through these three options,

00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:33.610
<v Participant 1>is anything missing? Would you like to see

00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:37.290
<v Participant 1>any other additional options on this popup?

00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:41.530
<v Participant 2>No, I don't think so. Healthcare.

00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:45.210
<v Participant 2>Yeah, no, I think that's fine.

00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:51.890
<v Participant 1>Okay. Okay. Would this be helpful or in your

00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:54.410
<v Participant 1>way as a first time veteran coming here?

00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:58.430
<v Participant 2>I mean, it wouldn't be in my way. I mean

00:23:58.430 --> 00:24:00.590
<v Participant 2>it, I guess it literally is in the way of

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:03.870
<v Participant 2>the website, but I think it's a, it's a helpful

00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:07.150
<v Participant 2>kind of like starting point. I think you

00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:08.910
<v Participant 2>could easily put this right at the top of

00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:11.230
<v Participant 2>whatever screen I log into. You know, it

00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:12.790
<v Participant 2>doesn't need to be this, but I think this,

00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:15.070
<v Participant 2>you know, you have to look at this. You can't

00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:15.750
<v Participant 2>avoid this.

00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:20.230
<v Participant 2>So I think ultimately this would be helpful.

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:22.390
<v Participant 2>Um, if I was showing up, as long as it didn't

00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:25.110
<v Participant 2>like pop up on every page and pop up maybe

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:27.270
<v Participant 2>every single time or something, but it's

00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:29.790
<v Participant 2>not a big deal either way. Okay.

00:24:29.790 --> 00:24:32.430
<v Participant 1>How, how often would you want to see this?

00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:34.150
<v Participant 1>Like, or when would you want to see this?

00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:38.510
<v Participant 2>I guess my impression of it is that it's

00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:41.430
<v Participant 2>like, hey, you just signed up. Like, here,

00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:43.750
<v Participant 2>this is what we can do for you. So in that

00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:46.910
<v Participant 2>regard, the first time I log in would make

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:48.870
<v Participant 2>sense. Again, it's not a big deal even if

00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:51.300
<v Participant 2>it popped up every time. But like, when the

00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:53.460
<v Participant 2>Internet is nothing but like things popping

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:55.740
<v Participant 2>up at you all the time, it's just, it's even

00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:57.500
<v Participant 2>the, you know, if it only happens once on

00:24:57.500 --> 00:24:58.540
<v Participant 2>the VA's page, whatever.

00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:00.300
<v Participant 2>But like, if it's every time, that's every

00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:02.420
<v Participant 2>time on top of the 50 other times with every

00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:05.660
<v Participant 2>other website. So I would say for my part,

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:09.100
<v Participant 2>the first time I log in, you know, after

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:12.340
<v Participant 2>creating the account, and then if, if you

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:14.100
<v Participant 2>want to have an option to like, never show

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:15.900
<v Participant 2>me this again or something, you know, maybe

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:17.620
<v Participant 2>that would be a good compromise, but I would

00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:18.780
<v Participant 2>probably only need it the once.

00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:20.310
<v Participant 1>You'd only need it the once?

00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:21.590
<v Participant 2>Yeah.

00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:23.670
<v Participant 1>And if you were coming here for the first

00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:26.190
<v Participant 1>time back in 2019, which one do you think

00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:27.430
<v Participant 1>you would have clicked on first?

00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:33.190
<v Participant 2>I mean, probably just the top one. It's the

00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:35.190
<v Participant 2>top one, I would think go to my VA is the

00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:37.630
<v Participant 2>home page and that would get me everything

00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:39.510
<v Participant 2>else. And I think if I remember from seeing

00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:41.870
<v Participant 2>the three links, I think that's true. I could

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:44.270
<v Participant 2>have gotten to healthcare and benefits from

00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:45.990
<v Participant 2>the MyVA. So I probably would have clicked

00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:46.630
<v Participant 2>the first one.

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:49.880
<v Participant 1>First one. Okay, great. So I'm going to move

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:52.400
<v Participant 1>us on to the next part of our session where

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:54.400
<v Participant 1>I'll share with you another link.

00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:59.680
<v Participant 1>And this is just another version of the same

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:01.960
<v Participant 1>thing we were looking at, except slightly

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:03.280
<v Participant 1>different. So.

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:07.040
<v Participant 2>Okay.

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:09.520
<v Participant 1>Just sent it to you in the chat.

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:12.320
<v Participant 2>Hang on.

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:21.240
<v Participant 2>Okay.

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:38.400
<v Participant 1>So yeah, this has come up. Think a lot as

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:40.160
<v Participant 1>you have been doing such a great job doing

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:40.960
<v Participant 1>so far and.

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:41.560
<v Participant 2>Okay.

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:49.720
<v Participant 2>Yeah, so I mean, this seems, I don't, I don't

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:50.800
<v Participant 2>want to cheat and look at the other one,

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:52.920
<v Participant 2>but I don't remember the. You can apply for

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:55.440
<v Participant 2>VA benefits. Most people start with one of

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:58.680
<v Participant 2>these benefits. This seems to be more clear

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:01.320
<v Participant 2>some, some way that it's the first thing

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:04.440
<v Participant 2>that pops up when you get here. I, I like,

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:08.080
<v Participant 2>I didn't love the like magnifying glass one

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:08.680
<v Participant 2>on the previous.

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:12.400
<v Participant 2>It just felt like other. Like a third thing

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:14.560
<v Participant 2>that wasn't quite as central as it almost

00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:15.240
<v Participant 2>like a search bar.

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:15.440
<v Participant 1>Right?

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:17.720
<v Participant 2>Like a search bar is separate. It's.

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:19.520
<v Participant 2>It's not a feature. It's not a thing you're

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:21.640
<v Participant 2>going to. I understand why it was a search

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:24.000
<v Participant 2>bar or a search like a magnifying glass.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.320
<v Participant 2>So this feels like three distinct places

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:30.240
<v Participant 2>to go to get the stuff you might want. And

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:32.440
<v Participant 2>when I think of the VA website, I think healthcare

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:33.240
<v Participant 2>disability.

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:35.640
<v Participant 2>Yeah, this. So this is, to me, this is better.

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:38.630
<v Participant 1>What makes it better?

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:41.270
<v Participant 2>It's just really clear. I mean, Even down

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:43.910
<v Participant 2>to the icons, you know, like, it's clean.

00:27:43.910 --> 00:27:47.310
<v Participant 2>It's like the little briefcase, health briefcase,

00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:50.830
<v Participant 2>paper thing. And then the hat.

00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:54.430
<v Participant 2>The graduation hat. Yeah. I mean, this is

00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:55.910
<v Participant 2>like, if I'm coming to the VA's website,

00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:58.390
<v Participant 2>I'm interested in one or all of these things.

00:27:58.710 --> 00:28:00.550
<v Participant 2>They're very clearly laid out. There's not

00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:02.790
<v Participant 2>like I don't have that same question of,

00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:04.190
<v Participant 2>like, well, that one looks like it could

00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:06.790
<v Participant 2>be a subset of that one, and maybe it's redundant.

00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:09.940
<v Participant 2>These seem three distinctive things, three

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:12.700
<v Participant 2>separate things. And this would let me go

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:15.700
<v Participant 2>to whichever one. Excuse me, Would be the

00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:18.140
<v Participant 2>one that I'm here for. So. No, this is, to

00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:20.660
<v Participant 2>me, much better yet.

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:22.820
<v Participant 1>I like what you're saying about redundancy.

00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:29.740
<v Participant 1>This one. So the other one was redundant

00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:33.020
<v Participant 1>in the sense that my VA was kind of like,

00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:34.900
<v Participant 1>everything kind of belonged under my va.

00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:35.620
<v Participant 1>The other two.

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:37.800
<v Participant 2>Yeah, that's what it seemed was like.

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:40.800
<v Participant 2>I didn't quite see them as distinctive, and

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:42.840
<v Participant 2>it didn't matter. I could go to the myva

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:44.440
<v Participant 2>and get to the other stuff, but then it kind

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:45.800
<v Participant 2>of made me question, well, what's the point

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:47.360
<v Participant 2>of this? You could have just taken me to

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:49.360
<v Participant 2>the Myva page. I could have gotten all this

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:52.400
<v Participant 2>from there. I realized that linking me directly

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:54.280
<v Participant 2>might save people some steps and keep them

00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:54.960
<v Participant 2>from getting lost.

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:58.320
<v Participant 2>But this is just much cleaner because I don't

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:01.640
<v Participant 2>have that question. It's all my va, all of

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:04.840
<v Participant 2>this, and which part of my VA I go to. I

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:06.640
<v Participant 2>mean, there could be a button for like, go

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:09.900
<v Participant 2>home to my va. Va. Right. But ultimately,

00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:11.460
<v Participant 2>I'm here for one of these reasons.

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:13.060
<v Participant 2>I'm not here for the home screen. I'm here

00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:14.820
<v Participant 2>to get to one of these. And so having the

00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:17.260
<v Participant 2>links to each here makes it easy.

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:21.300
<v Participant 1>Okay, got it, got it. So let's first go over

00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:24.620
<v Participant 1>that little sentence or two at the top.

00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:25.420
<v Participant 2>Okay.

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:29.140
<v Participant 1>What do you think about that as, like, the

00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:30.780
<v Participant 1>first thing you read when you come here?

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:34.540
<v Participant 2>He's verified a VA Go account.

00:29:39.790 --> 00:29:42.470
<v Participant 2>Yeah. I mean, it seems to imply that I just

00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:44.150
<v Participant 2>logged in for the first time, created my

00:29:44.150 --> 00:29:47.950
<v Participant 2>account. Whatever the va.gov account tells

00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:49.790
<v Participant 2>me I can apply for benefits, which would

00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:51.910
<v Participant 2>include those things below healthcare, disability,

00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:54.070
<v Participant 2>and education. And then most people start

00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:54.790
<v Participant 2>with these. Yeah.

00:29:54.790 --> 00:29:56.390
<v Participant 2>I mean, I don't know what else there would

00:29:56.390 --> 00:29:58.150
<v Participant 2>be beyond that. So that makes sense that

00:29:58.150 --> 00:29:59.910
<v Participant 2>most people start with those. So I think

00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:02.310
<v Participant 2>it explains what I just did and now what

00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:05.180
<v Participant 2>I might do, which is. I mean, that's what

00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:05.860
<v Participant 2>I'm. What I'm doing.

00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:06.740
<v Participant 2>So that makes sense.

00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:09.140
<v Participant 1>Are There any other things that are missing

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:10.820
<v Participant 1>from this? You kind of said that's. That's

00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:12.100
<v Participant 1>mostly what you would think, but is there

00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:13.380
<v Participant 1>anything else that's missing?

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:19.340
<v Participant 2>I mean, for my use of the VA stuff? No. @

00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:21.540
<v Participant 2>least not that I'm thinking of off the top

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:24.180
<v Participant 2>of my head. And also not that, like, would,

00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:26.380
<v Participant 2>in my opinion, need to be on the splash screen.

00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:26.660
<v Participant 2>Right.

00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:28.180
<v Participant 2>Like, there's a lot of other things, I'm

00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:30.260
<v Participant 2>sure that the VA website and the VA in general

00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:32.420
<v Participant 2>does, you know, like travel compensation

00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:36.410
<v Participant 2>or whatever. I don't know. But that. I don't

00:30:36.410 --> 00:30:38.610
<v Participant 2>think that needs to be, like, on the. Hey,

00:30:38.610 --> 00:30:40.250
<v Participant 2>you just made an account, you know, that.

00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:43.250
<v Participant 2>That feels more secondary, more down the

00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:46.490
<v Participant 2>road. So, again, as a starting point, this

00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:49.130
<v Participant 2>probably feels like what a person would care

00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:49.450
<v Participant 2>about.

00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:53.890
<v Participant 1>Got it. Okay. So going one by one, what would

00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:57.290
<v Participant 1>you expect to find behind each of these links?

00:30:57.450 --> 00:30:59.410
<v Participant 1>Like, if you clicked on VA Healthcare as

00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:00.130
<v Participant 1>a. Yeah.

00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:00.810
<v Participant 2>What would be.

00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:03.540
<v Participant 1>What would be the best possible thing to

00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:04.860
<v Participant 1>be on the other side of that?

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:10.260
<v Participant 2>Well, if I don't. I mean, probably the VA

00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:11.340
<v Participant 2>Healthcare homepage.

00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:13.860
<v Participant 2>The. If I had an account and I was already

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:15.700
<v Participant 2>set up, I would expect it to be, like, my

00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:18.100
<v Participant 2>messages from providers, making an appointment.

00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:19.780
<v Participant 2>You know, the stuff that I think I would

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:22.980
<v Participant 2>see if I logged in as me now, if I didn't

00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:24.580
<v Participant 2>have any history there, that wouldn't really

00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:27.740
<v Participant 2>be useful. So I would think that it would.

00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:30.250
<v Participant 2>I think given I'm new, it should take me

00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:30.930
<v Participant 2>to a blank.

00:31:31.010 --> 00:31:34.170
<v Participant 2>Not blank, but like a home screen there where

00:31:34.170 --> 00:31:36.490
<v Participant 2>it's like, hey, you have no records, you

00:31:36.490 --> 00:31:39.970
<v Participant 2>have no whatever. Assuming I don't for the

00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:42.850
<v Participant 2>healthcare one, would you like to apply for

00:31:42.850 --> 00:31:44.889
<v Participant 2>VA healthcare or see if you're eligible for

00:31:44.889 --> 00:31:46.730
<v Participant 2>VA healthcare? And then I click that, and

00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:48.450
<v Participant 2>then it's maybe one of Those little step,

00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:50.570
<v Participant 2>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, whatever, and then I can go

00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:53.250
<v Participant 2>through and, like, apply and, you know, start

00:31:53.250 --> 00:31:58.800
<v Participant 2>the process. Yeah, disability, same thing.

00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:01.440
<v Participant 2>If I had already been there, I would think

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:05.240
<v Participant 2>it would show my disability rating, any claims

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:07.480
<v Participant 2>and process, you know, whatever.

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:09.800
<v Participant 2>If I hadn't, I would think it would do the

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:11.640
<v Participant 2>same. It would say, you don't have any of

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:14.840
<v Participant 2>that. Click here to start the disability

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.120
<v Participant 2>filing process. But I would want that to

00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:19.560
<v Participant 2>be, like, kind of front and center, because

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:21.760
<v Participant 2>I think in the other one, it's like you could

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:23.960
<v Participant 2>kind of get lost because you don't have anything

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:26.000
<v Participant 2>in there yet. There's no need for me to,

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.400
<v Participant 2>like, the whole screen to be taken up with,

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:29.840
<v Participant 2>like, here's your disability rating.

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:32.040
<v Participant 2>You don't have one. Here's your, you know,

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:33.680
<v Participant 2>health records. You don't have any. You know,

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:36.079
<v Participant 2>I know that. So I would think that the big

00:32:36.079 --> 00:32:38.360
<v Participant 2>front and center thing should be a statement

00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:39.760
<v Participant 2>that says you don't have any of this.

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:40.880
<v Participant 2>Would you like to start?

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:46.460
<v Participant 1>So how does that compare to. And I, I could

00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:48.820
<v Participant 1>pull it up again if you, if you wanted. That

00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:51.780
<v Participant 1>other health version we were on, we were

00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:52.900
<v Participant 1>on My Healthy Vet.

00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:56.500
<v Participant 2>Yeah, I just, I, as I recall, it felt like

00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:59.100
<v Participant 2>it was, it was what I described, where it

00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:02.339
<v Participant 2>was like, you know, here's your rating.

00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:04.900
<v Participant 2>You don't have it. Here's your. This, you

00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:06.780
<v Participant 2>don't have it. Like it was just a bunch of

00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:09.420
<v Participant 2>categories that were empty because the person

00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:12.590
<v Participant 2>was new, which makes sense. But if I'm new,

00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:15.630
<v Participant 2>I know I don't have it or it doesn't matter.

00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:20.990
<v Participant 2>That's not useful right now. I don't mind

00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:22.710
<v Participant 2>it being that way because that's the way

00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:24.670
<v Participant 2>it will be when I come back in the future.

00:33:24.910 --> 00:33:27.310
<v Participant 2>I will theoretically have ratings, healthcare

00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:29.670
<v Participant 2>records, et cetera. And so having it be consistent

00:33:29.670 --> 00:33:31.510
<v Participant 2>isn't the worst thing. But I'm thinking if

00:33:31.510 --> 00:33:33.190
<v Participant 2>I'm trying to keep it simple and I'm trying

00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:35.630
<v Participant 2>to get here and start the process, maybe

00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:38.480
<v Participant 2>a splash screen or like a little pop up like

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:41.320
<v Participant 2>this maybe, or just a different page when

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:42.920
<v Participant 2>you click the link for the first time that

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:45.720
<v Participant 2>says click here to get started with disability

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:46.200
<v Participant 2>benefits.

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:48.960
<v Participant 2>You know, like very simple. And then like

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:50.920
<v Participant 2>click here to go to your homepage, I don't

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:54.160
<v Participant 2>know. Or like just have it ideally maybe

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:56.200
<v Participant 2>just at the top of the screen like a banner

00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:59.080
<v Participant 2>that says, you know, you don't have anything

00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:00.800
<v Participant 2>here. Click here to get started. And then

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:02.560
<v Participant 2>under that is all the stuff that you don't

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:02.800
<v Participant 2>have.

00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:05.060
<v Participant 2>You know, disability benefits, none of you

00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:05.660
<v Participant 2>know, whatever.

00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:11.980
<v Participant 1>Got it, got it. Okay. And just, yeah, education

00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:15.300
<v Participant 1>and training benefits. What do you, what

00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:15.820
<v Participant 1>would you expect?

00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:20.420
<v Participant 2>I'm most ignorant, I suppose, to that. I

00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:23.460
<v Participant 2>mean I would expect that there's, you know,

00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:26.700
<v Participant 2>like opportunities for, you know, using your

00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:29.860
<v Participant 2>benefits for education. So like GI Bill stuff

00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:33.230
<v Participant 2>and whatever. Um, training again, I, you

00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:35.510
<v Participant 2>know, I know the VA does partners with different

00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:37.750
<v Participant 2>organizations and stuff to help with training

00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:40.190
<v Participant 2>for careers and whatnot for people once they're

00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:43.070
<v Participant 2>out. So I would assume that that page would

00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:44.710
<v Participant 2>probably be like a collection of information

00:34:44.870 --> 00:34:46.550
<v Participant 2>about those different programs.

00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:49.950
<v Participant 2>I don't know that there's any like applications

00:34:49.950 --> 00:34:52.150
<v Participant 2>to check on there. I would assume it's just

00:34:52.150 --> 00:34:54.470
<v Participant 2>like, you know, here are links to different

00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:56.390
<v Participant 2>things that could help you with those topics.

00:34:57.080 --> 00:35:00.120
<v Participant 1>Got it. Got it. Okay, so let's go ahead and

00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:01.400
<v Participant 1>start with the first one.

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:04.520
<v Participant 2>Okay. All right.

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:09.320
<v Participant 2>You want me to talk about it? Okay.

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:13.120
<v Participant 1>How do you feel about landing here and take

00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:16.120
<v Participant 1>a second to check it out? Yeah, it's not.

00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:17.400
<v Participant 1>This one's not scrollable.

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:19.160
<v Participant 1>I mean, it will be scrollable, just not in

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:21.240
<v Participant 1>the prototype, but you can kind of think

00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:23.420
<v Participant 1>about the content that would be on this screen.

00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:23.900
<v Participant 2>Yeah.

00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:30.540
<v Participant 2>Yeah. I mean, this is kind of what I thought.

00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:35.340
<v Participant 2>It's a little bit more like, like, more websitey

00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:37.540
<v Participant 2>in terms of, like, before I. I said that,

00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:39.500
<v Participant 2>like, the page was just blank. It was just

00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:42.340
<v Participant 2>some text on a white background. This is

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:44.580
<v Participant 2>still that, but there's like menus and, you

00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:45.820
<v Participant 2>know, there's a little bit more of like,

00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:47.940
<v Participant 2>structure so that I can like get around it.

00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:50.970
<v Participant 2>And it feels just a little like, almost like

00:35:51.370 --> 00:35:53.090
<v Participant 2>I'm thinking of like a transit system, like

00:35:53.090 --> 00:35:54.890
<v Participant 2>a subway or something. You know, it's like,

00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:57.690
<v Participant 2>you know, maybe complicated, but like, you

00:35:57.690 --> 00:35:59.770
<v Participant 2>know, I see the little nested menu on the

00:35:59.770 --> 00:36:01.530
<v Participant 2>left and I know how to navigate something

00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:03.690
<v Participant 2>like that. So there's something like, reassuring

00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:05.450
<v Participant 2>to know, like, okay, I'm going to go to the

00:36:05.450 --> 00:36:06.770
<v Participant 2>left and I'm going to do everything I need

00:36:06.770 --> 00:36:12.050
<v Participant 2>to do there. Otherwise. Yeah, so it's just

00:36:12.050 --> 00:36:14.570
<v Participant 2>telling me like, if I qualify, you know,

00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:16.980
<v Participant 2>this is what I could have access to.

00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:20.700
<v Participant 2>I like the green arrow pointing at like,

00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:22.620
<v Participant 2>learn how to apply because presumably I need

00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:23.780
<v Participant 2>to do that kind of early.

00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:27.860
<v Participant 2>It makes sense, I think, to order it this

00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:28.180
<v Participant 2>way.

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:33.620
<v Participant 2>You know, here's what exists, you know, like

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:35.860
<v Participant 2>here, learn about it. Right. Vision. Long

00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:38.940
<v Participant 2>term dental eligibility probably should be

00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:41.590
<v Participant 2>above how to apply because, you know, knowing

00:36:41.590 --> 00:36:43.470
<v Participant 2>if you're eligible is probably the step before

00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:43.830
<v Participant 2>that.

00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:50.310
<v Participant 2>Yeah, I mean, I'm okay. So I'm assuming this

00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:52.350
<v Participant 2>is. Since this is a minus, that that means

00:36:52.350 --> 00:36:55.150
<v Participant 2>this is the menu underneath it. So, yeah,

00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:56.430
<v Participant 2>under. Under get benefits.

00:36:56.430 --> 00:36:59.790
<v Participant 2>I'm saying everything I see. Yeah. Open.

00:36:59.790 --> 00:37:01.670
<v Participant 2>Is that expanded? Basically.

00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:03.870
<v Participant 2>So, yeah, this is what I would imagine. I

00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:07.140
<v Participant 2>even like, I have a friend who got out right

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:10.460
<v Participant 2>around the time I did and he's works for

00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:13.940
<v Participant 2>an army base in Italy. And I'm assuming that

00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:16.140
<v Participant 2>foreign medical program would apply to him

00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:18.500
<v Participant 2>theoretically if he had VA benefits. So I

00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:21.020
<v Participant 2>even like the kind of more niche thing there

00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:23.740
<v Participant 2>for people with a very specific use case.

00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:24.540
<v Participant 2>I think that's.

00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:27.580
<v Participant 2>That's neat. So. But yeah, it looks pretty

00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:28.540
<v Participant 2>easy to navigate.

00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:31.380
<v Participant 1>Okay. How do you feel about this being the

00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:34.300
<v Participant 1>page that you landed on when you clicked

00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:34.420
<v Participant 1>it?

00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:36.140
<v Participant 1>Is this aligned with your expectations?

00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:38.060
<v Participant 2>Yeah, I think so.

00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:43.860
<v Participant 1>Okay. Anything else about this page you'd

00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:44.380
<v Participant 1>like to share?

00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:52.220
<v Participant 2>No. Looks. Looks good. Yeah, looks good.

00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:54.660
<v Participant 1>Okay, let's go ahead and click anywhere on

00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:55.180
<v Participant 1>the screen.

00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:56.300
<v Participant 2>Okay.

00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:59.420
<v Participant 1>And let's do the same for VA Disability compensation.

00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:02.740
<v Participant 2>Yeah, I mean, I appreciate the consistency

00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:06.410
<v Participant 2>of the design. So, like, having this design

00:38:06.730 --> 00:38:09.890
<v Participant 2>being like. If I navigated the previous one,

00:38:09.890 --> 00:38:11.250
<v Participant 2>I know how to navigate this one.

00:38:11.250 --> 00:38:13.490
<v Participant 2>With the same nested menu on the left and

00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:13.930
<v Participant 2>all that.

00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:20.570
<v Participant 2>Yeah. I mean, this is.

00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:24.690
<v Participant 1>This is a slight variation. The other one

00:38:24.690 --> 00:38:27.930
<v Participant 1>was the about page. This is the how to file

00:38:27.930 --> 00:38:28.890
<v Participant 1>a claim page.

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:33.580
<v Participant 2>Isn't it just the same, though, where it's.

00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:37.100
<v Participant 2>The first submenu just expanded. The other

00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:39.260
<v Participant 2>one was like, whatever. The top menu was

00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:41.300
<v Participant 2>expanded. And this is just the get benefits

00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:45.220
<v Participant 2>is expanded in terms of the style of it.

00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:47.340
<v Participant 2>Right. Like, isn't it? Because it looked

00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:49.740
<v Participant 2>like on the previous one, if there was like,

00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:51.380
<v Participant 2>a few different options on the left side,

00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:53.380
<v Participant 2>it was the top option that was expanded for,

00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:55.780
<v Participant 2>like, applying for healthcare or whatever.

00:38:57.250 --> 00:38:58.970
<v Participant 2>This one seems like the same where it's the

00:38:58.970 --> 00:39:01.170
<v Participant 2>first option, get benefits, which is expanded,

00:39:01.170 --> 00:39:02.970
<v Participant 2>showing eligibility, how to file a claim,

00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:07.690
<v Participant 2>et cetera. At any rate, it makes me think

00:39:07.690 --> 00:39:08.610
<v Participant 2>of the previous one.

00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:11.010
<v Participant 2>I know how to navigate the previous one.

00:39:11.010 --> 00:39:14.370
<v Participant 2>This one seems manageable too, I think, having

00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:17.210
<v Participant 2>links both on the left as well as in the

00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:20.930
<v Participant 2>middle. How do I prepare for starting for.

00:39:21.170 --> 00:39:23.050
<v Participant 2>What do you need? What does it involve?

00:39:23.050 --> 00:39:25.620
<v Participant 2>I think that's helpful to kind of get ready.

00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:28.660
<v Participant 2>So, yeah, if I was coming here, I'd probably

00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:30.300
<v Participant 2>be looking to either file a claim, which

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:34.420
<v Participant 2>I see file a claim online, or to, like, understand

00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:37.020
<v Participant 2>what I need to file a claim, which I can

00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:39.100
<v Participant 2>do there, too. Evidence needed. So this is

00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:40.100
<v Participant 2>what I would imagine.

00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:41.620
<v Participant 1>Got it.

00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:46.180
<v Participant 1>Okay, let's go ahead and click anywhere on

00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:48.820
<v Participant 1>the screen. Okay, let's do the last one.

00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:53.670
<v Participant 2>This one's a little jarring because it's

00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:56.870
<v Participant 2>a different design from the others, but it's

00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:59.350
<v Participant 2>also kind of what I thought, I think, where

00:39:59.350 --> 00:40:01.950
<v Participant 2>it's like, more about links to other places,

00:40:03.310 --> 00:40:05.230
<v Participant 2>because I. When I think I don't know what

00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:09.190
<v Participant 2>the VA does entirely, but, like, I would

00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:10.950
<v Participant 2>think that most of their stuff is, like,

00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:13.590
<v Participant 2>linking to other organizations, other programs,

00:40:13.590 --> 00:40:15.870
<v Participant 2>other things that are not strictly the va.

00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:19.860
<v Participant 2>And so basically, I would think this is just

00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:24.500
<v Participant 2>like a other resources section. So I like

00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:26.380
<v Participant 2>the phone numbers on the right, you know,

00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:29.340
<v Participant 2>in case I need to call somebody. That makes

00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:31.860
<v Participant 2>it easy. Yeah.

00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:34.260
<v Participant 2>So, like, if I want the GI Bill, that one's

00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:35.620
<v Participant 2>a big one that I would think would be at

00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:38.380
<v Participant 2>the top. Students outside the U.S. again,

00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:41.580
<v Participant 2>another one where it's like, you know, not.

00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:43.580
<v Participant 2>I don't know how many people need that specific

00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:45.740
<v Participant 2>thing, but I think it's cool because there

00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:47.540
<v Participant 2>are going to be people that need that. And,

00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:49.980
<v Participant 2>you know, there's schools away from here

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:51.660
<v Participant 2>that people might be at. So that's neat.

00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:53.380
<v Participant 2>One that I wouldn't have necessarily thought

00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:57.540
<v Participant 2>would be prioritized. Yeah. And then the

00:40:57.540 --> 00:40:59.300
<v Participant 2>links of resources here on the left.

00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:03.460
<v Participant 2>Yeah. I mean, this is basically.

00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:08.780
<v Participant 2>Yeah. Even the not a veteran part is cool.

00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:11.780
<v Participant 2>Like the idea that if I'm here as a school,

00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:14.300
<v Participant 2>I can get information too. I think that's,

00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:16.790
<v Participant 2>again, nothing I'd need, but that's useful.

00:41:17.590 --> 00:41:22.030
<v Participant 1>And for you specifically, does this hit what

00:41:22.030 --> 00:41:24.710
<v Participant 1>you need when you were clicking on that button?

00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:28.190
<v Participant 2>Yeah. I would assume the GI Benefits, GI

00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:30.790
<v Participant 2>Bill benefits would probably be my top thing.

00:41:31.110 --> 00:41:31.750
<v Participant 2>Eligibility.

00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:38.270
<v Participant 2>Another question would maybe. And it'll probably

00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:41.070
<v Participant 2>be. Yeah, I mean, the only other thing would

00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:42.870
<v Participant 2>be something to talk about, transferring

00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:46.410
<v Participant 2>your benefits. I don't even know if. If I'm

00:41:46.410 --> 00:41:48.650
<v Participant 2>eligible, I forget the rules.

00:41:48.650 --> 00:41:52.130
<v Participant 2>But it'd be nice maybe if, like, about GI

00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:53.610
<v Participant 2>Bill benefits, if it was like, learn how

00:41:53.610 --> 00:41:55.250
<v Participant 2>the GI Bill works and explore options to

00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:57.210
<v Participant 2>pay for school, cover expenses while you're

00:41:57.210 --> 00:41:59.130
<v Participant 2>training for a job, or transfer benefits,

00:41:59.130 --> 00:42:02.610
<v Participant 2>you know? You know, so maybe something referencing

00:42:02.610 --> 00:42:04.890
<v Participant 2>that might help me to know. That's what I

00:42:04.890 --> 00:42:05.930
<v Participant 2>want to click to do that.

00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:09.530
<v Participant 1>Okay, so comparing this page to the other

00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:11.380
<v Participant 1>two benefits that we were exploring. Exploring

00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:12.500
<v Participant 1>which one do you have a.

00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:15.980
<v Participant 2>Preference for the other two? I mean, those

00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:17.820
<v Participant 2>seem very similar to each other, so I'll

00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:19.580
<v Participant 2>just put them together. I think it was a

00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:20.900
<v Participant 2>little more straightforward just because

00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:22.900
<v Participant 2>it was nested in that menu system that I

00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:27.420
<v Participant 2>said I liked. This feels a little. It's fine

00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:29.780
<v Participant 2>on its own, but because it's different from

00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:31.700
<v Participant 2>those, it would be a little odd.

00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:33.220
<v Participant 2>Like, because I, I went to the first one,

00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:34.700
<v Participant 2>I went to the second one. Okay, these look

00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:36.100
<v Participant 2>the same. I know how to navigate them.

00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:36.360
<v Participant 1>And.

00:42:36.430 --> 00:42:37.710
<v Participant 2>And then all of a sudden the third one is

00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:38.750
<v Participant 2>just totally different.

00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:41.070
<v Participant 2>And so where I would have gone on the left

00:42:41.070 --> 00:42:43.870
<v Participant 2>side to like, go down that menu. So it's

00:42:43.870 --> 00:42:45.710
<v Participant 2>not that this is bad. It's just. It's different.

00:42:45.790 --> 00:42:48.350
<v Participant 2>And so, you know, it's, It's.

00:42:48.910 --> 00:42:51.790
<v Participant 2>It's just like kind of like numbering hotel

00:42:51.790 --> 00:42:54.350
<v Participant 2>rooms in a building and one floor is different

00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:55.750
<v Participant 2>from another one. It's like, why would we

00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:57.510
<v Participant 2>do it differently? We should have it be consistent.

00:42:57.510 --> 00:42:58.950
<v Participant 2>So if you can navigate one floor, you can

00:42:58.950 --> 00:42:59.870
<v Participant 2>navigate all of them.

00:43:00.430 --> 00:43:03.060
<v Participant 1>If you clicked on this one first, for example.

00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:05.980
<v Participant 2>Yeah, I don't think this would work for the

00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:07.420
<v Participant 2>other ones because the other ones really

00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:11.740
<v Participant 2>require, like the nested menu, you know,

00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:13.580
<v Participant 2>and so. And that's just what I prefer. So

00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:15.460
<v Participant 2>I would. I prefer the other two. Even if

00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:16.420
<v Participant 2>I click this one first.

00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:18.820
<v Participant 2>I think this is. I think this could be cleaned

00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:20.060
<v Participant 2>up a little bit instead of having everything

00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:22.020
<v Participant 2>just spread out over the page. I think it

00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:23.500
<v Participant 2>could be like the menu on the left where

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:26.980
<v Participant 2>it's like education, training, you know,

00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:28.500
<v Participant 2>whatever. I don't know what other things

00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:31.390
<v Participant 2>there could be. And then you click that and

00:43:31.390 --> 00:43:33.110
<v Participant 2>then within that might be the different links

00:43:33.110 --> 00:43:35.310
<v Participant 2>for things just for consistency of design.

00:43:36.350 --> 00:43:40.150
<v Participant 1>Got it, got it. Okay, great. Let's go ahead

00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:41.470
<v Participant 1>and click back on the screen.

00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:42.590
<v Participant 2>Okay.

00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:46.309
<v Participant 1>So is there anything else you'd like to share

00:43:46.309 --> 00:43:48.350
<v Participant 1>about this specific one that we're looking

00:43:48.350 --> 00:43:48.670
<v Participant 1>at?

00:43:49.630 --> 00:43:51.590
<v Participant 2>No, no. Like I said, I like it better than

00:43:51.590 --> 00:43:55.710
<v Participant 2>the first one. The first splash pop up thingy.

00:43:56.690 --> 00:43:59.410
<v Participant 1>Yeah. I'm gonna go send you another link

00:43:59.410 --> 00:44:02.570
<v Participant 1>and it's gonna have both of these kind of

00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:04.330
<v Participant 1>like side by side, so we can really talk

00:44:04.330 --> 00:44:05.250
<v Participant 1>about comparing.

00:44:05.490 --> 00:44:12.450
<v Participant 1>Okay. So just getting that link ready and

00:44:13.170 --> 00:44:13.970
<v Participant 1>here you go.

00:44:16.610 --> 00:44:23.380
<v Participant 2>Okay. Oh, yeah. All right. Yeah. You want

00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:24.220
<v Participant 2>me to tell you?

00:44:24.460 --> 00:44:25.100
<v Participant 1>Yep.

00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:25.820
<v Participant 2>Okay.

00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:30.620
<v Participant 2>I do like the bold. What would you like to

00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:33.700
<v Participant 2>do first on the right? I think that's kind

00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:35.500
<v Participant 2>of like my eyes draw welcome. And then what

00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:37.660
<v Participant 2>would you like to do first? Like, even not

00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:37.900
<v Participant 2>that.

00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:39.900
<v Participant 2>Like, it takes a lot of time to read two

00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:42.060
<v Participant 2>sentences between it, but it's like simple.

00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:45.900
<v Participant 2>I prefer, though overall, I prefer the left

00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:50.520
<v Participant 2>for the reasons I said. I also think. Yeah,

00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:52.480
<v Participant 2>I. I just think it makes more sense. I think

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:54.320
<v Participant 2>having, like, I'm here for those things,

00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:55.920
<v Participant 2>healthcare, disability, training.

00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:58.280
<v Participant 2>So having those three there and then if I

00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:01.080
<v Participant 2>get to that, presumably I can get to the

00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:03.000
<v Participant 2>others through some sort of a menu at the

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.120
<v Participant 2>top or whatever. So I prefer the left overall

00:45:05.359 --> 00:45:06.000
<v Participant 2>quite a bit.

00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:09.240
<v Participant 1>The right one, though, does have that bold

00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:10.640
<v Participant 1>that captures your.

00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:14.320
<v Participant 2>Yeah, yeah, it's useful. Yeah.

00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:16.890
<v Participant 2>I like the. The bull. Such a minor thing,

00:45:16.890 --> 00:45:19.650
<v Participant 2>but my eyes are drawn to the right more quickly

00:45:19.730 --> 00:45:23.330
<v Participant 2>and I feel like it again, like, if I'm in

00:45:23.330 --> 00:45:26.610
<v Participant 2>a hurry, not this busy, but if I was in a

00:45:26.610 --> 00:45:29.090
<v Participant 2>hurry, just like, what would you like to

00:45:29.090 --> 00:45:32.290
<v Participant 2>do? Like, simple click one go. Like, I like

00:45:32.290 --> 00:45:32.610
<v Participant 2>that.

00:45:33.090 --> 00:45:34.450
<v Participant 1>I bolded it for you.

00:45:34.530 --> 00:45:36.290
<v Participant 2>I was just gonna say. Did that just happen

00:45:36.290 --> 00:45:37.170
<v Participant 2>or am I crazy?

00:45:37.170 --> 00:45:38.770
<v Participant 1>No, no, no, that was me. I just.

00:45:38.770 --> 00:45:41.740
<v Participant 1>Okay. Does that. Does that change anything?

00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:44.540
<v Participant 2>I mean, it. Yeah, it's.

00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:48.100
<v Participant 2>Again, it's. It's I'm nitpicking, but I just

00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:48.860
<v Participant 2>find. Yeah.

00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:51.100
<v Participant 1>Option to see, like. Yeah.

00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:51.740
<v Participant 2>Yeah.

00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:52.700
<v Participant 1>Okay.

00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:56.460
<v Participant 2>Yeah. I mean, I. I like this. The sentence.

00:45:56.460 --> 00:45:57.980
<v Participant 2>What would you like to do first? Because

00:45:57.980 --> 00:46:02.220
<v Participant 2>it's just easy, you know? So if I really

00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:03.620
<v Participant 2>had to pick between the two, I still like

00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:08.150
<v Participant 2>the right. But again, it's not that big of

00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:08.590
<v Participant 2>a deal.

00:46:10.910 --> 00:46:11.470
<v Participant 2>Okay.

00:46:12.590 --> 00:46:14.030
<v Participant 1>What would you like to do first?

00:46:15.070 --> 00:46:16.910
<v Participant 2>Yeah, I like that question. Kind of like,

00:46:17.230 --> 00:46:19.630
<v Participant 2>you know, like, where do you want to go?

00:46:19.630 --> 00:46:19.990
<v Participant 2>Right.

00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:21.270
<v Participant 2>Like, where do you want to go next? That

00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:24.670
<v Participant 2>kind of thing. Something about that in bold

00:46:24.670 --> 00:46:27.710
<v Participant 2>just feels like, you know, if I'm. If I'm

00:46:27.710 --> 00:46:28.910
<v Participant 2>looking at this, I'm like, oh, there's a

00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:31.470
<v Participant 2>bunch of links, text, whatever. Again, I

00:46:31.470 --> 00:46:33.070
<v Participant 2>don't know if anyone's actually getting that

00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:35.840
<v Participant 2>tripped up on it, but I just like that, like,

00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:38.040
<v Participant 2>as a prompt for, like, where we're gonna

00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:38.320
<v Participant 2>go.

00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:41.520
<v Participant 1>Versus most people start with one of these

00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:42.080
<v Participant 1>benefits.

00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:46.080
<v Participant 2>Yeah. I mean, I don't know that I. I care

00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:47.680
<v Participant 2>much about what most people are doing. I

00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:49.760
<v Participant 2>know why I'm here, theoretically. So, like,

00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:51.600
<v Participant 2>you know, what would you like to do first

00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:53.560
<v Participant 2>is like, all right, Derek is here.

00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:56.360
<v Participant 2>He's got a mission. You know, what does he

00:46:56.360 --> 00:47:00.370
<v Participant 2>want to do? And then we go from there because

00:47:00.370 --> 00:47:02.490
<v Participant 2>presumably whatever most people are doing

00:47:02.490 --> 00:47:04.850
<v Participant 2>is. Yeah, I mean, that's. I don't even know

00:47:04.850 --> 00:47:06.810
<v Participant 2>what else there is to do besides that.

00:47:06.810 --> 00:47:08.930
<v Participant 2>Most people start with one of these. I mean,

00:47:08.930 --> 00:47:10.850
<v Participant 2>isn't that everything the va. The website's

00:47:10.850 --> 00:47:12.570
<v Participant 2>got? You know, I know there's probably a

00:47:12.570 --> 00:47:14.810
<v Participant 2>lot of nuance to that, but. So what would

00:47:14.810 --> 00:47:15.410
<v Participant 2>I like to do?

00:47:15.410 --> 00:47:16.410
<v Participant 2>Feels like a better question.

00:47:17.130 --> 00:47:23.370
<v Participant 1>Okay. Okay. Is there anything like, missing

00:47:23.370 --> 00:47:25.970
<v Participant 1>or like a hybrid version that you'd like

00:47:25.970 --> 00:47:27.660
<v Participant 1>to see in the version that works best for.

00:47:27.810 --> 00:47:28.130
<v Participant 1>For you?

00:47:32.610 --> 00:47:34.570
<v Participant 2>I mean, the. Discover your benefits could

00:47:34.570 --> 00:47:37.730
<v Participant 2>be nice on the left side, you know, like,

00:47:37.730 --> 00:47:40.010
<v Participant 2>as a less targeted option, you know, like

00:47:40.010 --> 00:47:42.650
<v Participant 2>more of like a tour thing. Right. Like, you

00:47:42.650 --> 00:47:44.570
<v Participant 2>can go directly to healthcare, directly to

00:47:44.570 --> 00:47:47.010
<v Participant 2>disability, directly to education, or as

00:47:47.010 --> 00:47:49.450
<v Participant 2>like maybe a central kind of middle at the

00:47:49.450 --> 00:47:52.050
<v Participant 2>bottom link, it could say, like, you know,

00:47:52.050 --> 00:47:54.250
<v Participant 2>take a tour, discover your benefits or something.

00:47:54.250 --> 00:47:56.450
<v Participant 2>Just more broadly, like, what does the website

00:47:56.450 --> 00:47:58.670
<v Participant 2>have if this isn't what you want?

00:47:58.750 --> 00:48:00.310
<v Participant 2>Again, I don't know what else people would

00:48:00.310 --> 00:48:02.390
<v Participant 2>be coming to the website for, but if this

00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:04.550
<v Participant 2>isn't what you wanted, it'll take you to

00:48:04.550 --> 00:48:07.270
<v Participant 2>a more like, homepage kind of toury kind

00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:10.270
<v Participant 2>of thing, like, more general than those specific

00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:11.150
<v Participant 2>points.

00:48:12.190 --> 00:48:19.470
<v Participant 1>Gotcha, Gotcha. Okay, now I'm wondering,

00:48:19.470 --> 00:48:23.990
<v Participant 1>is this pop up something that you could imagine

00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:29.310
<v Participant 1>being useful on any other parts of va.gov?

00:48:29.310 --> 00:48:32.270
<v Participant 2>I mean, I don't, I, I wouldn't need it like

00:48:32.350 --> 00:48:35.390
<v Participant 2>every time. And so like, I would think it

00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:37.150
<v Participant 2>would just be like the first time I log in,

00:48:37.310 --> 00:48:40.710
<v Participant 2>you know, but yeah, I don't know how it would

00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:42.630
<v Participant 2>even be implemented if like every time you

00:48:42.630 --> 00:48:44.670
<v Participant 2>go to a new page, there's a pop up that says,

00:48:44.670 --> 00:48:45.990
<v Participant 2>hey, where do you want to go?

00:48:45.990 --> 00:48:47.550
<v Participant 2>I feel like that would be unnecessary. So

00:48:47.550 --> 00:48:49.070
<v Participant 2>I don't know. I think probably the first

00:48:49.070 --> 00:48:50.910
<v Participant 2>time at the homepage is probably the place

00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:53.260
<v Participant 2>I'd want it. And then after that I wouldn't

00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:53.700
<v Participant 2>need it.

00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:54.580
<v Participant 1>Wouldn't need it.

00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:58.460
<v Participant 1>Okay, say you clicked on Healthcare and you're

00:48:58.460 --> 00:49:00.940
<v Participant 1>like, I don't really want this. I was just

00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:02.660
<v Participant 1>clicking around. I really wanted disability

00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:06.780
<v Participant 1>compensation. How would you like to. Would

00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:12.180
<v Participant 1>you want to get back to this link?

00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:15.420
<v Participant 2>If it was me and I'm looking behind the pop

00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:17.940
<v Participant 2>up, I would probably just click the VA benefits

00:49:17.940 --> 00:49:21.100
<v Participant 2>and healthcare dropdown and then just select

00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:23.860
<v Participant 2>what I assume would be like in that I would

00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:26.380
<v Participant 2>assume there's like basically these same

00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:28.660
<v Participant 2>links all over again, you know, so VA benefits

00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:29.780
<v Participant 2>and healthcare. And then under that would

00:49:29.780 --> 00:49:32.740
<v Participant 2>be healthcare, disability benefits and, or

00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:34.740
<v Participant 2>education and training. And then I would

00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:36.380
<v Participant 2>just click it there and that would be totally

00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:39.340
<v Participant 2>fine, you know, because assuming those are

00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:39.660
<v Participant 2>there.

00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:42.340
<v Participant 1>Okay, so if you lost this, it wouldn't be

00:49:42.340 --> 00:49:42.940
<v Participant 1>a big deal.

00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:45.740
<v Participant 2>No, because again, I see that VA benefits

00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:47.580
<v Participant 2>and healthcare dropdown, I know if I click

00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:49.540
<v Participant 2>that, I'm gonna get probably these options

00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:50.860
<v Participant 2>right there and that'd be fine.

00:49:51.410 --> 00:49:55.770
<v Participant 1>Okay, got it. Thinking about my VA for a

00:49:55.770 --> 00:49:59.530
<v Participant 1>moment. What if you had. What do you think

00:49:59.530 --> 00:50:00.770
<v Participant 1>of the name Myva?

00:50:02.610 --> 00:50:03.250
<v Participant 2>It's fine.

00:50:03.250 --> 00:50:05.650
<v Participant 2>I mean, it feels very on brand for like,

00:50:05.810 --> 00:50:08.410
<v Participant 2>you know, all of the online thing, you know,

00:50:08.410 --> 00:50:10.890
<v Participant 2>like every TV service is whatever plus, you

00:50:10.890 --> 00:50:15.290
<v Participant 2>know, and so I know Kaiser Permanente is

00:50:15.290 --> 00:50:17.940
<v Participant 2>my, I work for them and they're like, I have

00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:19.980
<v Participant 2>coverage to them as well. And theirs is like

00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:22.300
<v Participant 2>my doctor online, you know, so everything.

00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:25.500
<v Participant 2>I don't think of it really much. It just

00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:27.540
<v Participant 2>feels like it's like the way you brand your

00:50:27.540 --> 00:50:31.140
<v Participant 2>healthcare thing, you know, so. But it's

00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:32.620
<v Participant 2>fine, you know, I don't, I don't love it,

00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:33.340
<v Participant 2>I don't hate it.

00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:34.220
<v Participant 2>Anything.

00:50:34.220 --> 00:50:36.340
<v Participant 1>You would change its name to, to make it

00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:38.420
<v Participant 1>a bit more clear, especially for first time

00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:41.020
<v Participant 1>people like yourself when you came here,

00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:43.620
<v Participant 1>like you like see it when you were first

00:50:43.620 --> 00:50:45.260
<v Participant 1>here and be like, oh, I know what that is.

00:50:46.210 --> 00:50:48.370
<v Participant 2>Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't Want it to be some

00:50:48.850 --> 00:50:51.930
<v Participant 2>odd, like, totally unrelated thing, you know,

00:50:51.930 --> 00:50:54.090
<v Participant 2>like some random word that somebody came

00:50:54.090 --> 00:50:56.570
<v Participant 2>up with as a brand name. So I think as long

00:50:56.570 --> 00:51:00.170
<v Participant 2>as VA is in it, so that I know I'm on the

00:51:00.170 --> 00:51:02.650
<v Participant 2>VA website. Yeah.

00:51:02.650 --> 00:51:04.450
<v Participant 2>I just wouldn't want it to get so cute that,

00:51:04.450 --> 00:51:07.970
<v Participant 2>like, you don't know that you're at the VA

00:51:07.970 --> 00:51:09.970
<v Participant 2>still. So otherwise the fact that it has

00:51:09.970 --> 00:51:12.130
<v Participant 2>a VA there is fine. I think my VA is fine.

00:51:12.130 --> 00:51:13.970
<v Participant 2>It kind of personalizes it a little bit.

00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:15.200
<v Participant 1>Okay.

00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:19.520
<v Participant 1>Okay, got it. Now say this pop. This pop.

00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:22.640
<v Participant 1>Up came the left one. It's the one that you

00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:22.960
<v Participant 1>like.

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:27.200
<v Participant 1>Would you utilize it on your first entry?

00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:29.600
<v Participant 2>Yeah, yeah. I wouldn't close it. I would.

00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:31.200
<v Participant 2>I mean, because the options are I click one

00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:32.480
<v Participant 2>of those links or I click the X.

00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:36.480
<v Participant 2>Assuming I wasn't just here to, like, look

00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:39.080
<v Participant 2>around, I assume I have a mission. Like I

00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:42.760
<v Participant 2>need to apply for disability rating or I

00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:44.040
<v Participant 2>need. I don't. I don't remember which one

00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:45.760
<v Participant 2>you have to do first. Maybe I could have

00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:48.040
<v Participant 2>applied for healthcare first, but whatever

00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:49.880
<v Participant 2>I was there for, I would have clicked the

00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:51.200
<v Participant 2>link and I think it would have been one of

00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:53.800
<v Participant 2>those top two, because those are what I think

00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:55.760
<v Participant 2>of when I'm just getting out of the military.

00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:57.520
<v Participant 2>Those are what seems like the most important

00:51:57.520 --> 00:51:59.320
<v Participant 2>thing. And so I would have clicked the one

00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:01.160
<v Participant 2>that was relevant to me, and I think it would

00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:02.840
<v Participant 2>have been a smart thing to put there for

00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:04.480
<v Participant 2>people just getting connected.

00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:11.730
<v Participant 1>Got it, Got it. Okay, so my last question

00:52:11.730 --> 00:52:14.530
<v Participant 1>for you is something else we've been considering

00:52:14.930 --> 00:52:18.930
<v Participant 1>is like a tour, like a product website tour.

00:52:19.410 --> 00:52:21.370
<v Participant 1>Is that something that you like?

00:52:21.370 --> 00:52:22.969
<v Participant 1>What is your experience? When you think of

00:52:22.969 --> 00:52:24.370
<v Participant 1>tours on websites.

00:52:25.090 --> 00:52:27.250
<v Participant 2>Sometimes they can be cumbersome. You know,

00:52:27.250 --> 00:52:29.330
<v Participant 2>where it's like you got to click through

00:52:29.330 --> 00:52:32.050
<v Participant 2>like 20 slides to, like, see every. I don't

00:52:32.050 --> 00:52:32.730
<v Participant 2>need to see it all.

00:52:32.730 --> 00:52:36.090
<v Participant 2>I'm not going to remember it all. If I was

00:52:36.090 --> 00:52:39.570
<v Participant 2>going to have a tour here, I would say, you

00:52:39.570 --> 00:52:42.490
<v Participant 2>know, it should be an option, I guess, like

00:52:42.490 --> 00:52:44.370
<v Participant 2>I think I alluded to. Maybe at the bottom

00:52:44.370 --> 00:52:45.810
<v Participant 2>there's an option that says take a tour.

00:52:45.810 --> 00:52:47.410
<v Participant 2>You know, like, you don't know what you're

00:52:47.410 --> 00:52:48.850
<v Participant 2>doing here. Take a tour, see what we can

00:52:48.850 --> 00:52:49.250
<v Participant 2>do for you.

00:52:49.250 --> 00:52:53.090
<v Participant 2>That kind of thing. And then I would really

00:52:53.090 --> 00:52:56.930
<v Participant 2>just want it to show me the menus across

00:52:56.930 --> 00:53:00.170
<v Participant 2>the top. So, like, VA benefits, about VA

00:53:00.170 --> 00:53:02.890
<v Participant 2>and find a va. I think that would. I mean,

00:53:02.890 --> 00:53:03.810
<v Participant 2>maybe also the.

00:53:04.050 --> 00:53:06.250
<v Participant 2>The one that says Hector, presumably that's

00:53:06.250 --> 00:53:10.370
<v Participant 2>my profile. So maybe like an arrow pointing

00:53:10.370 --> 00:53:12.570
<v Participant 2>at the VA benefits that, you know, It. It

00:53:12.570 --> 00:53:14.050
<v Participant 2>opens it up and says, here's where you're

00:53:14.050 --> 00:53:15.170
<v Participant 2>going to select all the different things

00:53:15.170 --> 00:53:18.010
<v Participant 2>we can do for you. I don't know about va.

00:53:18.010 --> 00:53:19.290
<v Participant 2>I'm not really sure what's in there that

00:53:19.290 --> 00:53:19.970
<v Participant 2>I would care about.

00:53:19.970 --> 00:53:23.210
<v Participant 2>I mean, information. What is the va, Whatever.

00:53:23.210 --> 00:53:24.690
<v Participant 2>I don't know. So that one's not super important.

00:53:24.930 --> 00:53:27.330
<v Participant 2>Find a va. Just point at this, say, find

00:53:27.330 --> 00:53:29.130
<v Participant 2>your local va. You know, put in your address.

00:53:29.290 --> 00:53:31.130
<v Participant 2>We'll find the closest one. And then over

00:53:31.130 --> 00:53:33.330
<v Participant 2>on the far right one, pointing at Hector

00:53:33.330 --> 00:53:35.130
<v Participant 2>and saying, this is your profile. Click here

00:53:35.130 --> 00:53:40.170
<v Participant 2>to change name, address, whatever. Yeah,

00:53:40.170 --> 00:53:41.970
<v Participant 2>I mean, I think if it showed me that that

00:53:41.970 --> 00:53:43.930
<v Participant 2>would be sufficient to, like, get me started.

00:53:45.050 --> 00:53:45.690
<v Participant 1>Got it.

00:53:45.770 --> 00:53:49.210
<v Participant 1>Okay, great. Well, I'm going to invite our

00:53:49.290 --> 00:53:52.170
<v Participant 1>note taker to ask any questions she may have

00:53:52.170 --> 00:53:52.490
<v Participant 1>now.

00:53:52.820 --> 00:53:53.300
<v Participant 2>Okay.

00:53:54.020 --> 00:53:56.220
<v Participant 3>Derek, this was super helpful. Thank you.

00:53:56.220 --> 00:53:56.740
<v Participant 3>Thank you.

00:53:56.980 --> 00:53:57.540
<v Participant 2>No problem.

00:53:58.180 --> 00:54:00.980
<v Participant 3>You said you would pick the top two because

00:54:00.980 --> 00:54:05.020
<v Participant 3>that's what's most relevant to you. If you

00:54:05.020 --> 00:54:08.499
<v Participant 3>had to pick a third. Is education and training

00:54:08.499 --> 00:54:11.060
<v Participant 3>the one you pick, do you, in your experience,

00:54:11.300 --> 00:54:13.140
<v Participant 3>do you think other people are wanting something

00:54:13.140 --> 00:54:13.540
<v Participant 3>different?

00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:16.900
<v Participant 3>Curious what you would do with that third

00:54:16.900 --> 00:54:17.300
<v Participant 3>link.

00:54:18.350 --> 00:54:20.430
<v Participant 2>Might again, be my ignorance. I don't know

00:54:20.430 --> 00:54:22.430
<v Participant 2>off the top of my head, what third thing

00:54:22.510 --> 00:54:25.830
<v Participant 2>other than education? I would say yeah, yeah.

00:54:25.830 --> 00:54:26.590
<v Participant 2>But I think that's.

00:54:26.590 --> 00:54:28.230
<v Participant 2>I think that's probably a really good one

00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:31.070
<v Participant 2>for people separating. I. I did all of my

00:54:31.070 --> 00:54:32.790
<v Participant 2>schooling and everything while I was in and

00:54:32.790 --> 00:54:34.830
<v Participant 2>before, so, like, I. It's just not a priority

00:54:34.830 --> 00:54:36.630
<v Participant 2>for me. But I think for a lot of people coming

00:54:36.630 --> 00:54:37.990
<v Participant 2>out of the military, that could be a big

00:54:37.990 --> 00:54:38.270
<v Participant 2>one.

00:54:38.670 --> 00:54:39.790
<v Participant 3>Okay, great.

00:54:41.550 --> 00:54:43.750
<v Participant 3>I do have. I know David had kind of asked,

00:54:43.750 --> 00:54:45.880
<v Participant 3>like, yes, you don't want this popping.

00:54:45.880 --> 00:54:46.400
<v Participant 2>Up all the time.

00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:48.000
<v Participant 3>Don't get annoying. You don't want to be.

00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:51.920
<v Participant 3>Now this is great for the first time, taking

00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:55.240
<v Participant 3>away like the welcome, first time aspect

00:54:55.240 --> 00:55:00.080
<v Participant 3>of this, say that this, like, could. Hey,

00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:02.840
<v Participant 3>you started health care, you started applying

00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:05.080
<v Participant 3>for health care. Here are some things that

00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:07.600
<v Participant 3>you can do next. Like, do you want to be

00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:10.680
<v Participant 3>prompted when you take certain actions at

00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:10.920
<v Participant 3>all.

00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:14.850
<v Participant 2>On va.gov yeah, I mean, I think as long as

00:55:14.850 --> 00:55:16.810
<v Participant 2>it wasn't just like a dumb menu where it

00:55:16.810 --> 00:55:18.650
<v Participant 2>was just like every single time without fail.

00:55:18.650 --> 00:55:21.050
<v Participant 2>But if it was gonna like pop up and say,

00:55:21.050 --> 00:55:22.850
<v Participant 2>hey, you know, there's been a change in your

00:55:22.850 --> 00:55:26.730
<v Participant 2>disability application or, you know, like

00:55:26.730 --> 00:55:28.650
<v Participant 2>you said, like, you know, something about

00:55:28.650 --> 00:55:30.370
<v Participant 2>your healthcare or whatever, I think that

00:55:30.370 --> 00:55:32.810
<v Participant 2>could be good, you know, to draw your attention

00:55:32.810 --> 00:55:35.050
<v Participant 2>to the new thing that's happened. I just.

00:55:35.130 --> 00:55:36.690
<v Participant 2>The thing that's annoying with these kind

00:55:36.690 --> 00:55:39.340
<v Participant 2>of things is that it doesn't care. It doesn't.

00:55:39.340 --> 00:55:41.340
<v Participant 2>You know, just every time it's just like,

00:55:41.340 --> 00:55:41.980
<v Participant 2>here's this again.

00:55:41.980 --> 00:55:43.420
<v Participant 2>Here's. It's like I've seen it a thousand

00:55:43.420 --> 00:55:45.140
<v Participant 2>times, but if it's pointing out new information

00:55:45.620 --> 00:55:47.740
<v Participant 2>or something that I need to do next, I think

00:55:47.740 --> 00:55:49.780
<v Participant 2>that could be useful. Like context sensitive.

00:55:50.100 --> 00:55:50.540
<v Participant 1>Yeah.

00:55:50.540 --> 00:55:52.260
<v Participant 3>As long as it's personalized.

00:55:52.340 --> 00:55:52.820
<v Participant 2>Yeah.

00:55:52.900 --> 00:55:54.020
<v Participant 3>You care about that?

00:55:54.020 --> 00:55:55.300
<v Participant 2>Yeah. Yeah. Presumably.

00:55:55.300 --> 00:55:55.700
<v Participant 2>Yeah.

00:55:55.940 --> 00:55:58.420
<v Participant 3>Okay, awesome. Thank you for sharing.

00:55:58.660 --> 00:55:59.060
<v Participant 2>Sure.

00:56:01.300 --> 00:56:04.460
<v Participant 1>Okay, well, thank you again. Well, I want

00:56:04.460 --> 00:56:05.980
<v Participant 1>to actually ask. Do you have any questions

00:56:05.980 --> 00:56:08.150
<v Participant 1>for me as we kind of wrap up?

00:56:09.430 --> 00:56:11.990
<v Participant 2>No, No, I. I think that makes sense. I appreciate

00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:13.710
<v Participant 2>you guys doing this to make it easier.

00:56:13.710 --> 00:56:15.070
<v Participant 2>Like I said, I mean, I didn't have a problem

00:56:15.070 --> 00:56:17.870
<v Participant 2>with it, but I also know that there's all

00:56:17.870 --> 00:56:19.750
<v Participant 2>sorts of people with all sorts of understanding

00:56:19.750 --> 00:56:21.790
<v Participant 2>and like, you know, knowledge of these systems.

00:56:21.790 --> 00:56:24.150
<v Participant 2>And so I think making it easier is. Is wise.

00:56:24.150 --> 00:56:25.110
<v Participant 2>So I appreciate that.

00:56:26.070 --> 00:56:26.870
<v Participant 1>Well, yeah.

00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:28.910
<v Participant 1>Thank you again so much for your time. Your

00:56:28.910 --> 00:56:31.390
<v Participant 1>feedback has been so helpful to us as we

00:56:31.390 --> 00:56:33.590
<v Participant 1>continue to work on the site and just make

00:56:33.590 --> 00:56:37.550
<v Participant 1>it really work for veterans. Thank you and

00:56:37.550 --> 00:56:38.750
<v Participant 1>enjoy the rest of your day.

00:56:39.070 --> 00:56:40.710
<v Participant 2>Thank you, both of you. Have a good day,

00:56:40.710 --> 00:56:40.990
<v Participant 2>too.

00:56:41.230 --> 00:56:41.870
<v Participant 2>Bye. Bye.
