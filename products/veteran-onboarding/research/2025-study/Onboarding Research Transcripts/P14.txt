WEBVTT

00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:00.400
<v Participant 1>Morning.

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.840
<v Participant 2>And I've started recording now. I'd like

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.600
<v Participant 2>to confirm. Are you comfortable if I record

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.480
<v Participant 2>my screen and audio as we talk today?

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.720
<v Participant 1>Yes. Okay.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.840
<v Participant 2>Well, my first question's an easy one. What

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.360
<v Participant 2>state are you calling from today?

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:18.640
<v Participant 1>Virginia.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.880
<v Participant 2>Virginia. How is the weather in Virginia

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:21.200
<v Participant 2>now?

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.040
<v Participant 1>It's kind of rainy, but pretty, pretty nice.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:25.920
<v Participant 1>Temperate.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.120
<v Participant 2>Temperate. Is it getting colder?

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.080
<v Participant 1>A little bit.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.840
<v Participant 1>But this is our, you know, month or so of

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.920
<v Participant 1>decent between the really cold. Well, the

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.840
<v Participant 1>nasty cold and the really hot. So we're enjoying

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:39.160
<v Participant 1>it.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.240
<v Participant 2>Oh, that's good. That's good.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.000
<v Participant 2>I'm in Colorado and it's, it's starting to

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.200
<v Participant 2>get really cold, and it was just sunny and

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.400
<v Participant 2>warm like a couple days ago. So it's kind

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.890
<v Participant 2>of throwing you off, but yeah. Well, cool,

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.450
<v Participant 2>Cool. What branch of service did you serve.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.730
<v Participant 1>In and when did you transition out as the

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:01.250
<v Participant 1>Navy?

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.970
<v Participant 1>And it was about this time two years ago.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.450
<v Participant 2>About this time two years ago. Okay. And

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.330
<v Participant 2>then when did you make your va.gov account?

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.570
<v Participant 1>I assume it was during the first few months

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.280
<v Participant 1>or, or the last few months of active service.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.680
<v Participant 2>Last month of active service was this.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.320
<v Participant 1>I don't even know if that's possible. Probably

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.000
<v Participant 1>the first few months when I got out.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.960
<v Participant 2>Were you part of, like, the transition program,

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.920
<v Participant 2>like the tap?

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.080
<v Participant 1>I went through.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.480
<v Participant 1>Tap.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.760
<v Participant 2>Did they bring you, like, to make the account

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.600
<v Participant 2>or was that kind of on your own?

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.130
<v Participant 1>They definitely went over it. I, I, you know,

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.890
<v Participant 1>I'm assuming if, if it was allowed to, I'm

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.290
<v Participant 1>assuming active duty can open up an account.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.330
<v Participant 2>Yeah, yeah.

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.410
<v Participant 1>If that's the case, I, I, I most likely would

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.650
<v Participant 1>have done it during that time. Okay.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.210
<v Participant 2>And did you do it on your own or with, like,

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.730
<v Participant 2>that course?

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.290
<v Participant 1>I probably would have. It would have been

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.850
<v Participant 1>on my own.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.170
<v Participant 2>On your own. Okay.

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.530
<v Participant 1>Yeah.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.010
<v Participant 2>Why did you want a va.gov account? What was

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.530
<v Participant 2>the goal with having one?

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.770
<v Participant 1>I kind of assumed that you had to. I mean,

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.050
<v Participant 1>in the military, it's, you know, you're told,

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.849
<v Participant 1>hey, these are the accounts that you need

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.330
<v Participant 1>to get, and so you go get them.

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.450
<v Participant 2>So, yeah, va.gov there's benefits. Managing

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.820
<v Participant 2>them or applying for them. Were there any

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.620
<v Participant 2>specific things like that that prompted you,

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.300
<v Participant 2>like that you wanted to get or access.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.060
<v Participant 1>I knew that I had, I did the, the GI Bill.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.140
<v Participant 2>Okay.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.740
<v Participant 1>And so I knew that at some point, eventually,

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.740
<v Participant 1>when I wanted to take advantage of it, I

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.580
<v Participant 1>would need an account with the va.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.020
<v Participant 2>Okay.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.940
<v Participant 1>I'll be honest. Maybe that's when I opened

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.860
<v Participant 1>it. I, you know, that would have been four

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:04.860
<v Participant 1>or five years prior.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:05.300
<v Participant 1>Yeah.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.280
<v Participant 2>You to remember A lot. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.040
<v Participant 1>GI Bill. And then I knew that as I was transitioning

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.440
<v Participant 1>out, I was going to be looking into healthcare

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.000
<v Participant 1>or disability benefits just.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.200
<v Participant 1>Just to make sure I had access to it if I

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.800
<v Participant 1>needed it.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.360
<v Participant 2>Got it. So, GI Bill, healthcare, disability

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.920
<v Participant 2>benefits. Yeah, got it, got it. And as of

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.520
<v Participant 2>now, have you used va.gov to apply for any

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.320
<v Participant 2>other benefits?

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.300
<v Participant 1>I did apply for disability. I have not yet

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.980
<v Participant 1>used it for healthcare, but it's kind of

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.100
<v Participant 1>on my to do list.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:49.860
<v Participant 2>Okay, okay.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.060
<v Participant 1>And I haven't tapped into the GI yet.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.260
<v Participant 2>Okay, got it, got it.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.180
<v Participant 2>Okay, so.

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.150
<v Participant 2>And like, how often do you find yourself

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.790
<v Participant 2>on va.gov I guess other than.

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.270
<v Participant 1>You know, probably the first few months after

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.670
<v Participant 1>transitioning out, just making sure. Especially

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.350
<v Participant 1>with the disability claim, tracking that

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:20.470
<v Participant 1>process. I never. I just logged in this morning

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.710
<v Participant 1>just to make sure I could.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.960
<v Participant 2>Yeah, yeah, I gotcha. When you were making,

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.840
<v Participant 2>you know, the account for checking disability.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.840
<v Participant 2>I am. Like, you're a claim. You.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.320
<v Participant 2>You filed a claim probably, right?

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.720
<v Participant 1>Yes.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.920
<v Participant 2>The. How is the experience of, like, seeing

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.440
<v Participant 2>your claims and just, like, kind of reviewing

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.160
<v Participant 2>them, making sure everything's going smoothly?

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.000
<v Participant 1>Yeah, I was able to get kind of the status

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.080
<v Participant 1>and see the status pretty clearly.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.240
<v Participant 1>It was probably easier than. Than other government

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.080
<v Participant 1>sites and systems that I had been using while

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.240
<v Participant 1>in the military, so.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.960
<v Participant 2>Got it, got it. And how do you typically,

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.399
<v Participant 2>like, access, like, you know, managing your

00:05:09.399 --> 00:05:12.960
<v Participant 2>claims? Like, where do you look for that

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.920
<v Participant 2>information?

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.840
<v Participant 1>I mean, I would just go to the. The main

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.710
<v Participant 1>VA page and, like, looking at it now, it's.

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.630
<v Participant 1>It's, you know, one of the main categories

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:30.790
<v Participant 1>as I scroll down and I seem to recall, like,

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.190
<v Participant 1>it just being very easy to. To find the status

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.390
<v Participant 1>from that. Like, I don't have a pending claim

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:38.190
<v Participant 1>now, so I can't.

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.910
<v Participant 2>Yeah, so you're. You're saying, like, it

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.390
<v Participant 2>says disability compensation and that's where

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:45.230
<v Participant 2>you would click first?

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:49.540
<v Participant 1>Yeah, I would go, yes. Yeah.

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:50.260
<v Participant 2>Okay.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.940
<v Participant 2>And then through there, you would be able

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.100
<v Participant 2>to access your claim that.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.260
<v Participant 1>Yeah. And it might have been a couple clicks,

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.340
<v Participant 1>but it was pretty intuitive. I thought it

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.260
<v Participant 1>was pretty intimate. I didn't have any trouble.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:02.740
<v Participant 1>Yeah.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.660
<v Participant 2>Okay. Okay. And when you, like, get to a

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.780
<v Participant 2>new website, are you somebody who likes to,

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.470
<v Participant 2>you know, explore and, like, read the tutorial,

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:16.110
<v Participant 2>or do you want to just jump in?

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.590
<v Participant 1>I just want to jump in, and I want it very

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:22.270
<v Participant 1>easily and clear what I'm looking for and

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:22.990
<v Participant 1>just jump in.

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:27.830
<v Participant 2>Got it, Got it. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. It's funny,

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.950
<v Participant 2>I noticed your mug saying, I love board games,

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:31.710
<v Participant 2>and I wonder if that's also the same thing?

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:36.150
<v Participant 2>Yeah. Like, are you like a board game person

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.550
<v Participant 2>who like reads all the instructions and knows

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:41.590
<v Participant 2>or you're like, I just want to play for board

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:41.830
<v Participant 2>games.

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:44.150
<v Participant 1>I do read all the instructions and watch

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.390
<v Participant 1>some videos and. Yeah, yeah.

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:50.990
<v Participant 2>What about like that for va.gov like thinking

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:52.870
<v Participant 2>about tours or things like that?

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:55.150
<v Participant 2>Is that something that has a value to you

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:56.710
<v Participant 2>or would just get in your way?

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:03.790
<v Participant 1>Ideally, I would hope that anything I need

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:07.150
<v Participant 1>to do would be simple enough to not to not

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:12.850
<v Participant 1>need that. But understanding there's probably

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:15.170
<v Participant 1>some complicated processes that have to happen

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:19.410
<v Participant 1>when you're, you know, trying to set up a

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:23.410
<v Participant 1>new healthcare appointment. And if, if it's

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:26.810
<v Participant 1>complicated, then yeah, usually a. What works

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:28.450
<v Participant 1>best for me for, for this kind of stuff?

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:32.210
<v Participant 1>Video tutorial of someone showing the process

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:35.360
<v Participant 1>on screen that that helps.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:40.120
<v Participant 1>So video other websites that I utilize like

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.320
<v Participant 1>for work now, those have been helpful, that

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:44.080
<v Participant 1>type of stuff.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:51.440
<v Participant 2>Videos and, and in terms of like what they're

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:53.800
<v Participant 2>showing in this video, what, what do you

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.360
<v Participant 2>think are the most important things for a

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.960
<v Participant 2>new veteran to know how to do?

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.620
<v Participant 2>Like what would you, if, I mean you, you

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:04.100
<v Participant 2>had that experience, if you knew somebody

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:07.700
<v Participant 2>was coming, like a friend to va.gov what

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:09.380
<v Participant 2>would be the things that you make sure were

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:11.100
<v Participant 2>in the beginning of that video?

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:17.100
<v Participant 1>Probably, you know, setting up an account,

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:23.460
<v Participant 1>logging in and what you have access to on

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:25.860
<v Participant 1>the, whatever the home page that you get

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:31.750
<v Participant 1>logged into. So that way they know how to

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:34.750
<v Participant 1>easily see the, you know, get to the main

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:38.630
<v Participant 1>options that you have accessible there. Probably

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:40.790
<v Participant 1>all the, the initial things, you know, setting,

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:43.830
<v Participant 1>accessing your, you know, various benefits

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:47.950
<v Participant 1>to see how to access the status and then

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:49.350
<v Participant 1>also how to utilize.

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:54.910
<v Participant 1>I assume most vets are going to have at least

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:58.910
<v Participant 1>the GI Bill and so make sure they know how

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:00.470
<v Participant 1>to, how to see it, how to see the status

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:02.470
<v Participant 1>and how to actually use it when it comes

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:03.590
<v Participant 1>comes down to it.

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:05.590
<v Participant 2>Got it, got it.

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:11.470
<v Participant 2>Okay, so now we're going to move on to the

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:13.870
<v Participant 2>next part of our session where I'm going

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:16.910
<v Participant 2>to go ahead and share a prototype with you.

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:19.190
<v Participant 2>So it's kind of like a website, except not

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:20.470
<v Participant 2>everything works. Exactly.

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:26.510
<v Participant 2>Let's go ahead and share that. And have you

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:28.310
<v Participant 2>shared your screen before on Zoom?

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:29.830
<v Participant 1>Yeah.

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:31.950
<v Participant 2>Okay, so yeah, if you could pull that up

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:33.430
<v Participant 2>and share your screen, that would be great.

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:35.510
<v Participant 1>Oh, share my screen.

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:35.990
<v Participant 1>Okay.

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:36.550
<v Participant 2>Yeah.

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:44.630
<v Participant 1>I guess you want on the VA site or.

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:49.630
<v Participant 2>Oh, I just sent you a link on Z.

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:55.550
<v Participant 1>All right, hold on one second. I see.

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:16.920
<v Participant 1>Okay, I think it should be.

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:25.400
<v Participant 2>Yeah, no, I see it looks good. Okay. Yeah,

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:26.600
<v Participant 2>probably don't have to.

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:32.120
<v Participant 2>So let's just kind of go back and pretend.

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.000
<v Participant 2>Yeah. We're at the time where you're signing

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.160
<v Participant 2>up for the first time. You're making an account.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:42.400
<v Participant 2>Go ahead and make your account and let's

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.560
<v Participant 2>just go through the process a little bit.

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.000
<v Participant 1>Okay.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.080
<v Participant 2>Okay, great. So you can imagine all that

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:57.239
<v Participant 2>ID me stuff doesn't have to happen. And you

00:10:57.239 --> 00:10:59.760
<v Participant 2>finished it and now you're here. This is

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.480
<v Participant 2>the first thing you see. Welcome to VA.gov.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.840
<v Participant 2>what do you think about this modal?

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:13.930
<v Participant 1>I like it that it has, you know, probably

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:17.010
<v Participant 1>some of the top or most popular things that

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:22.410
<v Participant 1>would need to get clicked on, I guess.

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:28.450
<v Participant 1>Yeah. I, I'd be afraid is like, oh, I want

00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:30.770
<v Participant 1>to. I want to visit all three, but if I click

00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:33.140
<v Participant 1>up right now and they go to my va, am I going

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:36.700
<v Participant 1>to be able to easily find out how to go manage

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:39.940
<v Participant 1>my health care, you know, 10 minutes from

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:42.740
<v Participant 1>now? Let's find out.

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:46.740
<v Participant 2>Okay, I see what you're saying.

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:50.260
<v Participant 1>Like, I want to, I want to visit all three,

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:54.300
<v Participant 1>but now that I visited the first one, am

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:56.380
<v Participant 1>I going to be able to easily find the next

00:11:56.380 --> 00:12:00.710
<v Participant 1>one without that, that prompt anymore? Yeah.

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:02.550
<v Participant 2>Tell me more. What do you think?

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:14.150
<v Participant 1>I mean, yeah, so, so from right there, I,

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:17.070
<v Participant 1>I, you know, scrolling around, I can see

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:19.630
<v Participant 1>healthcare stuff, but I, I don't, I wouldn't

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:23.070
<v Participant 1>necessarily know if that's what that link

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:26.560
<v Participant 1>would have given me, you know, sent me.

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:35.360
<v Participant 1>So, yeah, it would feel like I'm missing

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.640
<v Participant 1>out some FOMO there on, on what it could

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:42.680
<v Participant 1>have showed me. But as far as the VA home

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:46.320
<v Participant 1>page. Okay. Yep. Claims and appeals rating.

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:50.760
<v Participant 2>Were you familiar with the, the term my VA

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:51.760
<v Participant 2>before you clicked on it?

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:53.150
<v Participant 1>On this.

00:12:58.030 --> 00:12:59.870
<v Participant 1>I don't know specifically. I just, it just

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:04.950
<v Participant 1>seemed like it would be my, my launching

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:06.990
<v Participant 1>point. That and it would have all my stuff.

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:09.310
<v Participant 1>I get. I guess to me, my VA would be the

00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:12.030
<v Participant 1>same as if I just logged into the VA homepage

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:16.910
<v Participant 1>and signed in a. Personalized stuff.

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:18.460
<v Participant 2>Yeah, personalized stuff.

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:23.050
<v Participant 2>While we're at it, I'm just curious, what

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:24.850
<v Participant 2>do you think about the name My va?

00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:29.810
<v Participant 1>Makes sense.

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:31.090
<v Participant 2>Makes sense.

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:31.810
<v Participant 1>Yeah.

00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:35.450
<v Participant 2>One thing we're thinking about is changing

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:39.930
<v Participant 2>that to my VA Dashboard. What do you think

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:41.330
<v Participant 2>about that as a change?

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:47.900
<v Participant 1>Yeah, it's more descriptive.

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:54.300
<v Participant 1>Yeah, it, it, you know, it really puts it

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:58.980
<v Participant 1>in concrete on what to expect. Yeah.

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:00.820
<v Participant 2>There's something else you might name it

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:01.660
<v Participant 2>that works better.

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:11.120
<v Participant 1>I mean, I like, I like my VA Dashboard. Launchpad.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:14.240
<v Participant 1>No, that's. I think, I think Dashboard fits.

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:16.000
<v Participant 1>That's pretty.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.840
<v Participant 1>I think a common usage yeah. Okay. Maybe

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:22.960
<v Participant 1>my VA homepage would be another.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.920
<v Participant 2>Got it, got it. Okay, great. Let's go ahead

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:33.360
<v Participant 2>and click on the screen. Just anywhere. Oh,

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:34.880
<v Participant 2>yeah.

00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:37.370
<v Participant 2>So let's go through this a little bit more.

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:40.810
<v Participant 2>Tell me about that first couple sentences.

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:43.930
<v Participant 2>What do you think about them?

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:55.570
<v Participant 1>Makes sense. I mean, I'm having to log in

00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:58.930
<v Participant 1>via some other, like, not directly va. Right.

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:03.050
<v Participant 1>So ID me or what is it the login Gov. So,

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:04.890
<v Participant 1>yep, it was successful.

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:06.650
<v Participant 1>I'm glad I remember my password.

00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:17.370
<v Participant 1>Yeah, nothing. Nothing crazy. Okay. And.

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:23.250
<v Participant 2>Yeah, so we did click on go to my VA before

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:24.410
<v Participant 2>we click on all the others.

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:26.530
<v Participant 2>Tell me what. What would happen if we clicked

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:28.170
<v Participant 2>on manage your healthcare? I know you said

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:29.960
<v Participant 2>you'd kind of want to go back, but what would

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:31.840
<v Participant 2>you expect to happen if you click there?

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.520
<v Participant 1>I would expect it would be.

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.840
<v Participant 1>So let's say I had been in the my VA and

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:43.960
<v Participant 1>gone to the healthcare section, and I would

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:45.760
<v Participant 1>assume there's some sort of, like, if I click

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:49.000
<v Participant 1>on it, you would go to a page that's all

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.160
<v Participant 1>just about my healthcare. I would. I would

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.520
<v Participant 1>think that this would lead me to that same

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:58.730
<v Participant 1>page, but all my stuff with. Yeah, claims,

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:01.330
<v Participant 1>appointments, records.

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:05.890
<v Participant 2>Now, you specifically told me you don't have

00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:06.690
<v Participant 2>health.

00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:08.770
<v Participant 2>VA health. Do you have VA health?

00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:14.130
<v Participant 1>I. I think I do, but I've never really clicked

00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:16.810
<v Participant 1>around it, and I've not like, set up appointments

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:19.490
<v Participant 1>or anything other than during the disability

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:20.640
<v Participant 1>claim.

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:25.200
<v Participant 2>Got it, Got it. So if you say, for example,

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:28.360
<v Participant 2>you didn't have health care yet, what would

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:29.920
<v Participant 2>you expect to see if you click there?

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:38.960
<v Participant 1>So whatever forms or things you need to do,

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:42.640
<v Participant 1>a checklist of things you need to do to access

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:47.890
<v Participant 1>or get signed up with VA healthcare, a list

00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:51.410
<v Participant 1>of who, I don't know, maybe they can even

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:55.690
<v Participant 1>automatically say, yes, you are. You know,

00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:58.490
<v Participant 1>it's available to you or not. Except I don't.

00:16:58.490 --> 00:16:59.970
<v Participant 1>I don't know who is it? Who it's available

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:00.370
<v Participant 1>to.

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:05.010
<v Participant 2>Got it, Got it. And then let's do discover

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:07.010
<v Participant 2>your benefits. Tell me what is discover your

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:07.570
<v Participant 2>benefits?

00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:12.459
<v Participant 1>I would imagine that this is. Would be more

00:17:12.459 --> 00:17:12.659
<v Participant 1>of.

00:17:12.659 --> 00:17:14.699
<v Participant 1>Kind of what you're talking about, a tutorial,

00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:19.059
<v Participant 1>just, you know, flashing through screenshots

00:17:19.059 --> 00:17:23.299
<v Participant 1>of some of the different things that we could

00:17:23.299 --> 00:17:26.219
<v Participant 1>access via my va.

00:17:26.939 --> 00:17:30.059
<v Participant 2>Okay, let's go ahead and click on discover

00:17:30.059 --> 00:17:30.779
<v Participant 2>your benefits.

00:17:33.499 --> 00:17:36.539
<v Participant 2>Does this match your expectations? Yeah,

00:17:36.539 --> 00:17:37.339
<v Participant 2>have a look here.

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:54.049
<v Participant 1>Okay, so this is. Looks like it's more like

00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:59.290
<v Participant 1>how you can use it to tailor what you want

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:01.490
<v Participant 1>to have focused on in the myva.

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:07.500
<v Participant 1>Or let's see why.

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:11.660
<v Participant 2>Oh, yes, I. It won't let you click beyond

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:12.860
<v Participant 2>that. But okay.

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:18.220
<v Participant 1>Yeah, so I. Well, I would be a little wary

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:23.460
<v Participant 1>because I guess what, what personally, what

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:25.780
<v Participant 1>I would not want is, hey, yeah, I'm interested

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:27.580
<v Participant 1>in a new career, understanding my benefits

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:28.540
<v Participant 1>and make a plan.

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:31.480
<v Participant 1>Right. I click, click, click. And then now

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:36.000
<v Participant 1>I would be getting 15 emails a day of various.

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:38.640
<v Participant 1>Here are all the benefits for this, and here

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:39.680
<v Participant 1>are all the benefits for that.

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:45.680
<v Participant 2>What makes you think you'd get 15 emails?

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.680
<v Participant 1>That's just how it is these days. I'm trying

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:52.200
<v Participant 1>to remember if I had that experience with

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:58.330
<v Participant 1>va. I. I do. For a while there, I was getting

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:01.370
<v Participant 1>a lot of calls and I think emails just making

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:07.250
<v Participant 1>sure that my transition went well, but my

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:08.970
<v Participant 1>preference, it seemed excessive.

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:11.770
<v Participant 1>Yeah.

00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:16.330
<v Participant 2>So what. What would a good discover your

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:19.250
<v Participant 2>benefits page be like one that works really

00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:20.010
<v Participant 2>well for you?

00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:25.890
<v Participant 1>So part of transitioning is you don't know

00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:30.050
<v Participant 1>what you don't know. And so, you know, here,

00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:32.210
<v Participant 1>I guess we do kind of have a list of the

00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:35.250
<v Participant 1>different possibilities, but a lot of people

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:37.450
<v Participant 1>coming out, they don't even know. I mean,

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:39.530
<v Participant 1>I still don't know. Right. Of like, what's

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:40.690
<v Participant 1>all available for the.

00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:44.130
<v Participant 1>From the VA and you know, from there, then

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:46.490
<v Participant 1>we can start deciding, does it apply to me?

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:50.900
<v Participant 1>So I guess I would have expected something

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:54.620
<v Participant 1>of a smorgasbord of, here's all the different

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:58.780
<v Participant 1>things that VA does to serve vets.

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:05.140
<v Participant 1>And then after seeing it all, then I can

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:07.940
<v Participant 1>start deciding on, all right, what do I need

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:09.020
<v Participant 1>to start focusing on?

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:13.660
<v Participant 1>And maybe that is kind of what we're doing

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:16.480
<v Participant 1>here, but it looks like we're.

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:23.640
<v Participant 2>So when you say smorgasbord, you mean kind

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:28.080
<v Participant 2>of like a big list or like all your options

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:29.120
<v Participant 2>kind of in one place?

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:32.600
<v Participant 1>I. Yeah, I'm just like.

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:34.600
<v Participant 2>Like a platter of food, basically. Right.

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:38.840
<v Participant 1>I guess something like, like a. Oh, it's

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:42.700
<v Participant 1>like a bunch of pictures of the different

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:45.180
<v Participant 1>things that they do.

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:45.860
<v Participant 1>I don't know.

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:49.860
<v Participant 2>Yeah. Yeah. And would these be ones that

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:54.020
<v Participant 2>you're eligible for or just all of them?

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:54.860
<v Participant 2>Like, how.

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:56.420
<v Participant 2>How curated is this?

00:20:58.900 --> 00:20:59.780
<v Participant 2>These options?

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:03.460
<v Participant 2>What would be your preference?

00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:13.150
<v Participant 1>H. I like to see everything, but also knowing

00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:16.750
<v Participant 1>what I am not eligible for is useful just

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:20.630
<v Participant 1>to. But. But sometimes even if I'm not eligible

00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:23.630
<v Participant 1>now, circumstances may change. And just so

00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:26.510
<v Participant 1>knowing what's out there is. Is nice to have

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:27.390
<v Participant 1>in the back of your mind.

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:31.710
<v Participant 2>Okay, so you would see everything.

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:33.270
<v Participant 1>Yeah.

00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:35.990
<v Participant 2>Including ones you might not be eligible

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:36.310
<v Participant 2>for.

00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:37.590
<v Participant 1>Yep.

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:42.550
<v Participant 1>But that is really helpful where, like, you

00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:44.710
<v Participant 1>know, hey, your data is in the system, so,

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:47.670
<v Participant 1>you know, being able to Easily screen off

00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:50.470
<v Participant 1>everything they're not eligible for is definitely

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:50.950
<v Participant 1>helpful.

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:53.750
<v Participant 1>Great.

00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:57.310
<v Participant 2>Okay, let's go ahead and click again on the

00:21:57.310 --> 00:22:03.550
<v Participant 2>screen and let's do manage your health care.

00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:08.910
<v Participant 1>Okay. Yeah, this is kind of what I would

00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:10.270
<v Participant 1>expect to see.

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:16.510
<v Participant 2>Yeah, tell me more.

00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:23.070
<v Participant 1>Yeah, so appointments. Yep. Schedule, manage

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:26.380
<v Participant 1>upcoming. I like that. It's very, you know,

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:27.660
<v Participant 1>it's probably the first thing you want to

00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:28.740
<v Participant 1>be looking at.

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:32.260
<v Participant 1>Access to your records. Great.

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:40.460
<v Participant 1>Yeah, everything looks good. I think assuming

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:44.500
<v Participant 1>I was not, I guess signed up for VA healthcare,

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:47.540
<v Participant 1>you know, something similar but more of just

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:51.940
<v Participant 1>like forms or whatever on what you would

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:55.260
<v Participant 1>need to get signed up for or a big message

00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:56.460
<v Participant 1>saying you are not eligible.

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:04.300
<v Participant 2>You are not eligible.

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:11.420
<v Participant 2>Yeah. Yeah. So on the inverse of you are

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:16.380
<v Participant 2>not eligible eligibility is what you're like

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:19.750
<v Participant 2>looking to uncover as somebody who might

00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:21.630
<v Participant 2>not have health care or is there something

00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:22.430
<v Participant 2>before that?

00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:33.990
<v Participant 1>No, I mean I guess if you were already signed

00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:37.990
<v Participant 1>up and just forgot, you know. But yeah, if

00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:41.310
<v Participant 1>you're not in the system, but you could have

00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:44.280
<v Participant 1>access in, it'd be, it'd be good to know.

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:48.960
<v Participant 2>Got it, got it. Okay, let's go ahead and

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:50.120
<v Participant 2>click one more time.

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:58.999
<v Participant 2>So seeing this modal or popup, is anything

00:23:58.999 --> 00:23:59.880
<v Participant 2>else missing?

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:08.840
<v Participant 1>I mean the fact that healthcare is on here?

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:14.000
<v Participant 1>Yeah. My first thing is like well what. What

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.960
<v Participant 1>are the other big thing, you know, what,

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:17.240
<v Participant 1>what's not on here? Right.

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:22.120
<v Participant 1>And so gi, GI benefits probably first thing

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:24.880
<v Participant 1>comes to my mind and you know, I don't know,

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:27.960
<v Participant 1>is there something different with healthcare

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:33.400
<v Participant 1>that just makes it warrant being on the list?

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:36.040
<v Participant 1>Vice the things that are not on it.

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:44.720
<v Participant 2>What. So why just health care? Why not?

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:47.400
<v Participant 1>Yeah, yeah. Why not others?

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:49.160
<v Participant 1>And you know, I understand if you put everything

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:50.960
<v Participant 1>right it's going to get too cluttered. So.

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:54.800
<v Participant 1>But yeah, I don't know if they're. And maybe,

00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:56.840
<v Participant 1>maybe y' all have the data. Maybe healthcare

00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:58.520
<v Participant 1>is just, that's what's, you know, the vast

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:01.000
<v Participant 1>majority of the usage. Maybe it makes sense.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:01.760
<v Participant 1>I don't, I don't know.

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:07.830
<v Participant 2>Good. Okay. And is this helpful to you or

00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:10.230
<v Participant 2>is it getting in your way as a pop up?

00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:18.790
<v Participant 1>I guess if the other default or if the other

00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:22.030
<v Participant 1>option is it would instead just go straight

00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:28.680
<v Participant 1>to my va. Because by va I, I think right.

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:30.680
<v Participant 1>If we go to that it. If you scroll around,

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:34.480
<v Participant 1>you'll find the access to your healthcare

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:41.000
<v Participant 1>and maybe you would find access to something,

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.960
<v Participant 1>you know, discover your benefit. So if that

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:46.560
<v Participant 1>were the other option then I mean kind of

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:51.840
<v Participant 1>neutral, but probably lean towards just going

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:56.240
<v Participant 1>straight to the dashboard, you would.

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:58.400
<v Participant 2>Okay, so we don't need this.

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:00.480
<v Participant 2>We would just go straight to the dashboard.

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:02.480
<v Participant 2>And you can access that stuff?

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:04.880
<v Participant 1>I think so. You know, but with this though,

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:08.080
<v Participant 1>I, you know, some sites you can tailor a,

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:14.000
<v Participant 1>you know, a quick list of shortcuts, you

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.480
<v Participant 1>know, somewhat similar this. And if that

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.800
<v Participant 1>were customizable, like, hey, you know, I

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:20.200
<v Participant 1>only use it for these four things and somehow

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:21.680
<v Participant 1>those are the four things that pop up, that

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:22.240
<v Participant 1>would be awesome.

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:22.730
<v Participant 1>But.

00:26:24.810 --> 00:26:26.890
<v Participant 2>That'S, that's a cool idea. What, what would

00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:28.170
<v Participant 2>your four things be?

00:26:28.650 --> 00:26:34.810
<v Participant 1>Oh, I'm probably, yeah. Healthcare, GI Bill

00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:40.450
<v Participant 1>and your homepage. Probably those three for

00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:40.730
<v Participant 1>me.

00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:43.570
<v Participant 2>Got it, got it. Okay, I'm gonna go ahead

00:26:43.570 --> 00:26:48.490
<v Participant 2>and send you another link. The same chat

00:26:49.050 --> 00:27:07.410
<v Participant 2>in zoom and we're going to do the same thing

00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:08.330
<v Participant 2>of logging in.

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:22.180
<v Participant 1>Okay.

00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:26.100
<v Participant 1>I forget what the other one said. The other

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:27.060
<v Participant 1>one say the same thing.

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:31.020
<v Participant 2>It said something slightly different. I can

00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:34.340
<v Participant 2>read it to you. Like, let me pull that up.

00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:41.310
<v Participant 2>The other one said, we verified your va.gov

00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:45.150
<v Participant 2>account. You can now start exploring VA benefits

00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:45.470
<v Participant 2>online.

00:27:46.510 --> 00:27:48.350
<v Participant 1>Okay, first.

00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:54.590
<v Participant 2>Okay, what do you think about the difference

00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:55.470
<v Participant 2>in the copy?

00:27:58.270 --> 00:27:59.470
<v Participant 1>In the, in the copy.

00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:00.950
<v Participant 2>Oh, what do you think about the difference

00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:02.830
<v Participant 2>in the, in the, in the sentences?

00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:06.350
<v Participant 1>Oh, yeah, this, this is, I think especially

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:10.780
<v Participant 1>you know, just signing up for the first time.

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:14.100
<v Participant 1>I like this. You know, most people start

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:16.300
<v Participant 1>with one of these benefits that, that definitely

00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:20.500
<v Participant 1>helps for the, the whole like, hey, I have

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:23.459
<v Participant 1>no idea what's out there because yeah, transition

00:28:23.459 --> 00:28:25.500
<v Participant 1>is a, it's a tough time.

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:29.900
<v Participant 1>Yeah, this definitely helps. Say like, hey,

00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:32.820
<v Participant 1>these are probably the three things to start

00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:34.860
<v Participant 1>with that you really want to get moving on.

00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:39.270
<v Participant 2>Yeah, you want to start with that?

00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:39.910
<v Participant 1>You want to get moving.

00:28:39.910 --> 00:28:40.870
<v Participant 2>Okay. Okay.

00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:41.310
<v Participant 1>Yeah.

00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:45.110
<v Participant 2>And what do you think about these options?

00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:48.190
<v Participant 2>Let's, let's start with number one, VA healthcare.

00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:53.710
<v Participant 2>What would you expect to see if you clicked

00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:54.110
<v Participant 2>on that?

00:28:59.870 --> 00:29:02.990
<v Participant 1>I would think the, whatever getting started

00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:12.450
<v Participant 1>type links and information eligibility, especially

00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:16.530
<v Participant 1>if I'm still active, getting ready to transfer,

00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:23.970
<v Participant 1>you know, eligibility information and man,

00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:29.650
<v Participant 1>even like comparison on, hey, here's what

00:29:29.650 --> 00:29:31.170
<v Participant 1>you have now. Here's how it's going to be

00:29:31.170 --> 00:29:35.150
<v Participant 1>different, especially specifically with healthcare

00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:38.350
<v Participant 1>that's, you know, we're used to just being

00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:40.790
<v Participant 1>spoon fed everything, right? They tell you

00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:43.550
<v Participant 1>when to go to the doctor, what to do and.

00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:48.750
<v Participant 2>Absolutely. Now tell me about disability

00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:49.710
<v Participant 2>compensation.

00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:55.710
<v Participant 1>This was pretty confusing when I did it.

00:29:57.070 --> 00:29:59.310
<v Participant 1>Again, you don't know and you hear so much

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:01.680
<v Participant 1>information out there. So many people telling

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:05.800
<v Participant 1>you different things. So really clear, concise

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:10.440
<v Participant 1>on here's how to like the process. Like here's

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:12.840
<v Participant 1>how to make your claims here's your time

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:13.320
<v Participant 1>gates.

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:16.560
<v Participant 1>I missed my time window when I was active

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:18.800
<v Participant 1>to get my claim filed, so I did it after

00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:19.480
<v Participant 1>I got out.

00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:27.360
<v Participant 1>So really having all that spelled out, which

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:29.760
<v Participant 1>you probably already do, I'll be honest,

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:34.600
<v Participant 1>but there's just so many, even military sites

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:38.760
<v Participant 1>that try to help do the same thing, and they're

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:42.880
<v Participant 1>all kind of different. This makes the whole

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:46.880
<v Participant 1>process very confusing, but, you know, definitely

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:49.240
<v Participant 1>coming from the VA website, we just want

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:53.260
<v Participant 1>to be very concrete, very explicitly, clearly

00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:56.260
<v Participant 1>spelled out what to do, how to do the process.

00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:04.500
<v Participant 2>Got it, got it. And then tell me about education

00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:07.220
<v Participant 2>benefits or education and training benefits.

00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:13.460
<v Participant 1>Yeah, I would want to see. Let's see if you're

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:16.740
<v Participant 1>in there. So I assume that if you're in there

00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:20.070
<v Participant 1>again, you're. You're linked up so they have

00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:22.270
<v Participant 1>your data. So you'll be able to see that.

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:26.390
<v Participant 1>Yes, verified. I do have my GI still, still

00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:31.510
<v Participant 1>showing all that information, how to actually

00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:38.630
<v Participant 1>utilize it and what it actually gives along

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:40.510
<v Participant 1>with other training benefits. Because I know

00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:47.750
<v Participant 1>when we got out and I don't know how I forget

00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:49.230
<v Participant 1>where I found out, but there, there were

00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:52.590
<v Participant 1>other benefits that I got. I don't know if

00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:54.350
<v Participant 1>it's through the va, just through other programs,

00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:56.870
<v Participant 1>but that, you know, take like a single course

00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:59.030
<v Participant 1>type thing or stuff with a spouse that they

00:31:59.030 --> 00:31:59.790
<v Participant 1>could utilize.

00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:04.110
<v Participant 1>Yeah. Okay.

00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:06.910
<v Participant 2>Which one do you want to click on first?

00:32:08.670 --> 00:32:10.350
<v Participant 1>Hold it. Oops.

00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:13.030
<v Participant 1>We'll do the education and training.

00:32:15.510 --> 00:32:21.590
<v Participant 1>All right. Yep. About eligibility. Okay.

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:43.760
<v Participant 1>I would assume if I were to scroll down that

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:49.480
<v Participant 1>I would see my actual benefits that I've

00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:51.840
<v Participant 1>signed up for and that's what I would hope

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:54.080
<v Participant 1>to see somewhere on the, this page.

00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:00.000
<v Participant 2>And when you see your actual benefits, what

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.720
<v Participant 2>do you, what, what are you looking for? What

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:04.080
<v Participant 2>details are you looking for?

00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:12.450
<v Participant 1>Like, for me it'd be how many, I guess, months

00:33:12.850 --> 00:33:17.290
<v Participant 1>that I have credit for and who I've assigned

00:33:17.290 --> 00:33:17.890
<v Participant 1>those to?

00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:23.970
<v Participant 1>Yeah, I guess that's the main thing.

00:33:25.090 --> 00:33:28.010
<v Participant 2>How many months of credit? Okay.

00:33:28.010 --> 00:33:30.100
<v Participant 1>Yeah. And who could.

00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:31.380
<v Participant 1>Because we can give it to family members,

00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:33.340
<v Participant 1>you know, who, who they're assigned to.

00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:38.780
<v Participant 1>Yeah.

00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:44.220
<v Participant 2>Okay. What if you didn't? What, does everyone

00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:46.219
<v Participant 2>have their credits when they come here or

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:49.380
<v Participant 2>would you be applying for them? Tell me more

00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:50.220
<v Participant 2>about your experience.

00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:57.000
<v Participant 1>If they are ch. Like if they're in taps,

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.720
<v Participant 1>getting ready to transition out and they

00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:06.320
<v Participant 1>have not done the GI Bill yet, I think they're

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:09.720
<v Participant 1>too late because I. There's like, I know

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:11.200
<v Participant 1>most people, right, they want to be able

00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:14.200
<v Participant 1>to transfer to family members and I think

00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:17.640
<v Participant 1>there's a four year timer, you Owe the service

00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:21.580
<v Participant 1>four years once you sign in for that. So

00:34:21.650 --> 00:34:22.770
<v Participant 1>if they didn't know about that and they're

00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:24.130
<v Participant 1>in taps, they're, they're too late.

00:34:24.850 --> 00:34:25.570
<v Participant 2>Gotcha.

00:34:25.810 --> 00:34:30.810
<v Participant 1>So I would want a, a, some sort of, you know,

00:34:30.810 --> 00:34:34.730
<v Participant 1>informational on there as well, that. Let's

00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:39.810
<v Participant 1>say they have signed up to transfer to five

00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:44.170
<v Participant 1>members, but they're still active duty. Some

00:34:44.170 --> 00:34:47.050
<v Participant 1>sort of thing saying, you know, you're still

00:34:47.050 --> 00:34:50.060
<v Participant 1>required to serve two more years to fulfill

00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:54.860
<v Participant 1>this particular benefit. Some sort of information

00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:55.900
<v Participant 1>on time remaining.

00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:57.260
<v Participant 2>Time remaining.

00:34:57.580 --> 00:35:04.300
<v Participant 1>Okay, back to your question though, if you're

00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:06.300
<v Participant 1>just signing up. Is that your question was.

00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:07.220
<v Participant 1>Yeah.

00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:11.580
<v Participant 2>Like say it's your first time here, you don't

00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:15.110
<v Participant 2>know much about GI Bill. What would you expect?

00:35:15.350 --> 00:35:17.350
<v Participant 2>What would you want to see? Like when you

00:35:17.350 --> 00:35:18.230
<v Participant 2>first came here?

00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:21.390
<v Participant 1>Yeah, I would click about the GI Bill and

00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:25.590
<v Participant 1>I would hope to see, you know, what, what

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:35.910
<v Participant 1>exactly. That is stuff that their, their

00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:37.510
<v Participant 1>career counselor should have given them,

00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:39.950
<v Participant 1>but if they didn't, then, you know, I should

00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:40.390
<v Participant 1>be here.

00:35:41.170 --> 00:35:41.930
<v Participant 2>Got it, got it.

00:35:41.930 --> 00:35:43.970
<v Participant 2>So your career, you had a career counselor.

00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:50.690
<v Participant 1>Maybe. I don't know. People. The information's

00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:51.410
<v Participant 1>out there. Yeah.

00:35:51.570 --> 00:35:56.050
<v Participant 2>Okay. Got it, got it, got it. Okay. Feel

00:35:56.050 --> 00:35:58.010
<v Participant 2>free to click anywhere and we'll get, It'll

00:35:58.010 --> 00:36:00.130
<v Participant 2>bring us back to the page we were just on.

00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:01.570
<v Participant 1>Okay.

00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:06.010
<v Participant 1>And I do like how it's not just Giulia. Right.

00:36:06.010 --> 00:36:08.620
<v Participant 1>There's, there's other stuff too, so I want

00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:11.700
<v Participant 1>to explore those other benefits.

00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:27.540
<v Participant 1>So I do like. Well, okay, if this was first

00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:29.460
<v Participant 1>time, assuming they haven't claimed anything.

00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:30.740
<v Participant 1>All right. Yeah, this makes sense.

00:36:33.790 --> 00:36:34.110
<v Participant 2>All right.

00:36:34.350 --> 00:36:45.990
<v Participant 1>Yeah, file a claim. File a claim. Yep, it

00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:47.070
<v Participant 1>all, it all makes sense.

00:36:56.270 --> 00:36:56.910
<v Participant 1>Let's see.

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:03.080
<v Participant 2>Yeah, tell me, what are you thinking as you

00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:04.200
<v Participant 2>just kind of go through here?

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:06.920
<v Participant 1>The only thing that caught my mind. All right.

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:09.560
<v Participant 1>My attention is just, you know.

00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:12.880
<v Participant 2>Follow.

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:16.760
<v Participant 1>A claim for an increase might make sense

00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:30.250
<v Participant 1>also up here, but yeah, I mean, it all makes

00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:31.850
<v Participant 1>sense. And I assume, you know, as I go into

00:37:31.850 --> 00:37:34.490
<v Participant 1>each one of these, it would be, you know,

00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:36.050
<v Participant 1>expand to me more, more information.

00:37:38.290 --> 00:37:41.530
<v Participant 1>I do like how I think the way it currently

00:37:41.530 --> 00:37:47.050
<v Participant 1>is, is it has like I don't have to click

00:37:47.050 --> 00:37:49.970
<v Participant 1>on anything to, to view, for example, my

00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:53.250
<v Participant 1>current rating and compensation and all that.

00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:58.290
<v Participant 1>Like it. It's right there on my, my VA dashboard.

00:38:04.610 --> 00:38:08.170
<v Participant 2>So bringing us back to the time where you

00:38:08.170 --> 00:38:11.610
<v Participant 2>just came here for the first time, what would

00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:14.690
<v Participant 2>you click on first?

00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:19.780
<v Participant 1>I would start exploring eligibility. That's

00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:22.540
<v Participant 1>just the right. I gotta see.

00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:27.740
<v Participant 1>You know, it is gonna be worth spending a

00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:31.180
<v Participant 1>lot of time and effort into exploring if

00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:33.660
<v Participant 1>you know, depending on how eligible I am.

00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:38.300
<v Participant 2>Okay.

00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:42.020
<v Participant 1>And one thing that I don't see here, and

00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:47.220
<v Participant 1>maybe if I clicked around again, the biggest

00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:50.060
<v Participant 1>thing is that when you're in the service,

00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:53.460
<v Participant 1>like, you don't know what you should be trying

00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:54.940
<v Participant 1>to file a claim for.

00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:00.899
<v Participant 1>And I don't know if it makes sense to have

00:39:00.899 --> 00:39:06.220
<v Participant 1>that kind of guidance, but there's just,

00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:07.980
<v Participant 1>there's a lot of misinformation out there.

00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:12.870
<v Participant 2>Yeah. Tell me a little bit more about what

00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:15.110
<v Participant 2>you don't. You're not told what you should

00:39:15.350 --> 00:39:16.550
<v Participant 2>file a claim for.

00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:20.630
<v Participant 1>Yeah. So I think for a lot of service members,

00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:25.110
<v Participant 1>a lot of us don't go to medical, so, like,

00:39:25.110 --> 00:39:26.709
<v Participant 1>there's not much in the record anyways.

00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:32.710
<v Participant 1>But, you know, there are things that a minor,

00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:36.350
<v Participant 1>you know, minor pain from an injury at some

00:39:36.350 --> 00:39:39.150
<v Participant 1>point. Right. But it's very minor. It doesn't

00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:43.070
<v Participant 1>like, it doesn't bother you now. And so you

00:39:43.070 --> 00:39:43.670
<v Participant 1>don't think about it.

00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:45.470
<v Participant 1>So you don't think about digging up out of

00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:46.630
<v Participant 1>your record. You probably don't even remember

00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:48.430
<v Participant 1>it, but it's, it's buried in your record.

00:39:48.430 --> 00:39:50.990
<v Participant 1>Right. And then, but it's something that

00:39:51.390 --> 00:39:53.189
<v Participant 1>10 years from now, as you get a little older,

00:39:53.189 --> 00:39:55.190
<v Participant 1>it's going to come out and now, you know,

00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:59.390
<v Participant 1>you're, you're hobbling around. And my concern

00:39:59.390 --> 00:40:02.070
<v Participant 1>would be that, okay, well, when it's that

00:40:02.070 --> 00:40:03.910
<v Participant 1>much later, it's going to be that much harder

00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:08.210
<v Participant 1>to file a claim and, and, you know, prove

00:40:08.210 --> 00:40:09.490
<v Participant 1>connection and all that.

00:40:11.570 --> 00:40:15.290
<v Participant 1>And so, you know, a lot of people, myself

00:40:15.290 --> 00:40:16.370
<v Participant 1>included, we went to.

00:40:18.530 --> 00:40:18.810
<v Participant 2>I.

00:40:18.810 --> 00:40:20.729
<v Participant 1>Went to American Legion, but you know, different

00:40:20.729 --> 00:40:22.690
<v Participant 1>organizations that kind of help go through

00:40:22.690 --> 00:40:24.130
<v Participant 1>your record and say, okay, this, this is

00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:25.690
<v Participant 1>something you should, you know, look at or

00:40:25.690 --> 00:40:28.330
<v Participant 1>talk about. And, but a lot of people either

00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:30.770
<v Participant 1>don't have time or don't know to go do that.

00:40:31.570 --> 00:40:36.250
<v Participant 1>And again, I don't know if it really is the

00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:40.290
<v Participant 1>appropriate place to have guidance like that.

00:40:40.290 --> 00:40:40.690
<v Participant 1>But.

00:40:42.770 --> 00:40:46.850
<v Participant 2>Yeah, talking to like a vso, the better.

00:40:46.930 --> 00:40:49.210
<v Participant 1>Exact. Yeah. And maybe, you know, that's

00:40:49.210 --> 00:40:50.250
<v Participant 1>why they exist. Right.

00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:56.370
<v Participant 1>That's why VSO and, you know, but maybe even

00:40:56.370 --> 00:40:59.330
<v Participant 1>just some, something to point you in that

00:40:59.330 --> 00:41:03.130
<v Participant 1>direction on the VA site, if, if this is

00:41:03.130 --> 00:41:05.770
<v Participant 1>the only resource that a service member is

00:41:05.770 --> 00:41:09.490
<v Participant 1>going to, that would at least help point

00:41:09.490 --> 00:41:11.890
<v Participant 1>them and say, hey, you should, you know,

00:41:11.890 --> 00:41:15.170
<v Participant 1>you can find more help by these organizations.

00:41:16.770 --> 00:41:20.090
<v Participant 2>Got it, Got it. So it's, it's a lot to throw

00:41:20.090 --> 00:41:21.970
<v Participant 2>someone into learning about eligibility,

00:41:22.690 --> 00:41:24.620
<v Participant 2>what, when they might not even have all the,

00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:28.220
<v Participant 2>their, their stuff prepared.

00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:37.180
<v Participant 1>Oh, yeah, well, yeah, exactly. Yeah, they

00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:38.860
<v Participant 1>don't even know what, what they should be

00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:40.220
<v Participant 1>thinking about, what they should be asking

00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:41.060
<v Participant 1>for or looking for.

00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:43.380
<v Participant 1>Yeah. Because. Because when I get to file

00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:45.900
<v Participant 1>a claim, I, I would suspect that I already

00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:48.820
<v Participant 1>know what I'm filing a claim for. Right.

00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:50.350
<v Participant 1>Like, I know that.

00:41:50.350 --> 00:41:52.070
<v Participant 1>Oh yeah. I'm gonna try to file a claim on

00:41:52.070 --> 00:41:53.950
<v Participant 1>this injury that happened. And so my medical

00:41:53.950 --> 00:41:55.910
<v Participant 1>record, here's all the paperwork, you know,

00:41:56.310 --> 00:41:59.310
<v Participant 1>but, but there's.

00:41:59.310 --> 00:42:03.230
<v Participant 2>This step before that that is a lot more

00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:06.950
<v Participant 2>like figure out what you can claim. Right,

00:42:07.350 --> 00:42:07.750
<v Participant 2>right.

00:42:07.830 --> 00:42:09.670
<v Participant 1>You know what, what you can, what you should.

00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:12.470
<v Participant 1>I know there's a lot of gray area in that,

00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:15.880
<v Participant 1>but, you know, there are things that they

00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:18.560
<v Participant 1>should be looking at that they may not know

00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:18.880
<v Participant 1>too.

00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:22.160
<v Participant 2>Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:24.640
<v Participant 2>And what would like a page like that be called?

00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:42.160
<v Participant 1>Explore your medical history. I don't know.

00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:43.040
<v Participant 1>Let's see.

00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:56.420
<v Participant 1>You know, explore areas where, you know,

00:42:56.420 --> 00:43:00.820
<v Participant 1>most common areas where service members file

00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:02.620
<v Participant 1>claims. I don't know.

00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:05.420
<v Participant 2>Got it.

00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:10.230
<v Participant 1>Or you know, where to get help in determining,

00:43:11.350 --> 00:43:14.510
<v Participant 1>determining claim eligibility. And I, it's

00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:16.070
<v Participant 1>maybe a little bit different here. Right.

00:43:16.070 --> 00:43:16.550
<v Participant 1>Eligibility.

00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:19.990
<v Participant 1>I'm assuming here is more of you are a veteran,

00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:23.790
<v Participant 1>you served X amount of years, you were honorably

00:43:23.790 --> 00:43:26.950
<v Participant 1>discharged. Right. Stuff like that, I assume.

00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:33.990
<v Participant 1>Maybe not. But, you know, something to the

00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:35.750
<v Participant 1>effect of, you know, exploring the eligibility

00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:42.430
<v Participant 1>on a particular injury. That, that type of

00:43:42.430 --> 00:43:42.950
<v Participant 1>eligibility.

00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:47.430
<v Participant 2>Yeah. You said get help and I, I, I like

00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:49.190
<v Participant 2>that stuck with me.

00:43:49.510 --> 00:43:50.390
<v Participant 1>Okay. Yeah.

00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:53.590
<v Participant 2>For understanding what to do.

00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:59.630
<v Participant 2>Okay, so let's go ahead and click again on

00:43:59.630 --> 00:44:16.600
<v Participant 2>the screen and let's do healthcare and tell

00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:17.680
<v Participant 2>me, what are you thinking?

00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:28.820
<v Participant 1>Yeah, this is, I mean, as me right now, who

00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:31.100
<v Participant 1>this is on my to do list. All this makes

00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:31.540
<v Participant 1>sense.

00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:35.940
<v Participant 1>Yep. Verify I'm eligible. All right. How

00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:37.700
<v Participant 1>do I actually apply to make an appointment?

00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:45.260
<v Participant 1>You know, something, and this may be. Can

00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:47.060
<v Participant 1>apply to other pages. You know what to expect.

00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:50.900
<v Participant 1>Like once you make an appointment, you'll,

00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:54.390
<v Participant 1>you know, expect to receive a call. You'll

00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:57.150
<v Participant 1>get information will be displayed on this

00:44:57.150 --> 00:44:57.550
<v Participant 1>page.

00:44:58.270 --> 00:45:00.230
<v Participant 1>We'll keep you up to date. Emails, that kind

00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:00.670
<v Participant 1>of stuff.

00:45:03.950 --> 00:45:06.150
<v Participant 1>Maybe that's what after you apply, maybe

00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:07.790
<v Participant 1>that kind of information would be in there.

00:45:09.149 --> 00:45:12.350
<v Participant 1>Scanning down here, I see VA dental insurance

00:45:12.350 --> 00:45:24.000
<v Participant 1>program. But no, nothing for, I mean, I guess

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.640
<v Participant 1>you should assume that VA healthcare is,

00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:33.600
<v Participant 1>is all paid for, but, you know, maybe I'm

00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:36.640
<v Participant 1>not fully eligible for 100 VA healthcare,

00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:39.640
<v Participant 1>but I am eligible to apply to some sort of

00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:42.480
<v Participant 1>insurance that allows me access to VA health

00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:44.560
<v Participant 1>care. I don't know, it probably doesn't exist,

00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:48.330
<v Participant 1>but the fact that dental is in here makes

00:45:48.330 --> 00:45:50.010
<v Participant 1>Me just. It just makes me think of that.

00:45:50.490 --> 00:45:53.890
<v Participant 2>Oh, okay. Okay, got it, got it. So because

00:45:53.890 --> 00:45:57.170
<v Participant 2>you see dental in here, you wonder, is VA

00:45:57.170 --> 00:45:59.450
<v Participant 2>healthcare fully covered or not?

00:45:59.850 --> 00:46:01.209
<v Participant 1>Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because.

00:46:01.210 --> 00:46:03.810
<v Participant 1>Yeah, dental insurance, I would think. Okay,

00:46:03.810 --> 00:46:05.530
<v Participant 1>what about metal medical insurance?

00:46:08.330 --> 00:46:09.770
<v Participant 2>What would you click on first?

00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:15.460
<v Participant 1>Me right now in my current position? Yeah,

00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:23.420
<v Participant 1>probably how to apply, but I think just first

00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:26.020
<v Participant 1>time exploring, always, you know, just. I'm

00:46:26.020 --> 00:46:27.700
<v Participant 1>looking for an overview of what the benefits

00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:28.020
<v Participant 1>are.

00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:37.060
<v Participant 2>Okay, let's go ahead and click on the screen.

00:46:39.690 --> 00:46:42.370
<v Participant 2>And now that we've had a chance to see this,

00:46:42.370 --> 00:46:51.090
<v Participant 2>is anything missing talking.

00:46:51.090 --> 00:46:53.210
<v Participant 1>About from this screen particularly, or.

00:46:54.170 --> 00:46:55.690
<v Participant 2>Yeah, from this screen?

00:47:00.570 --> 00:47:02.650
<v Participant 1>I don't think so.

00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:07.940
<v Participant 2>Okay. Like, would anything make this easier

00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:11.180
<v Participant 2>or better for you to use or you, you like

00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:11.780
<v Participant 2>these three?

00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:15.660
<v Participant 1>I think these three make sense. I mean these

00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:18.700
<v Participant 1>are what I would think are the, the top three

00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:19.780
<v Participant 1>things people are looking for.

00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:28.620
<v Participant 2>Okay. And does this get in your way or is

00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:29.220
<v Participant 2>it helpful?

00:47:32.730 --> 00:47:35.770
<v Participant 1>Eventually, as I have already explored this

00:47:35.770 --> 00:47:38.330
<v Participant 1>stuff, I wouldn't really want to see this

00:47:38.330 --> 00:47:38.970
<v Participant 1>pop up.

00:47:40.250 --> 00:47:42.290
<v Participant 2>How, for how long would you want to see it

00:47:42.290 --> 00:47:42.890
<v Participant 2>popped up?

00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:51.450
<v Participant 1>Probably after I've already gone through

00:47:51.450 --> 00:47:53.050
<v Participant 1>the three links. I probably don't need it

00:47:53.050 --> 00:47:53.530
<v Participant 1>anymore.

00:47:54.980 --> 00:47:57.180
<v Participant 2>So say you went through the first one, how

00:47:57.180 --> 00:47:59.300
<v Participant 2>would you, how would you re. Access this?

00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:07.620
<v Participant 1>That I wouldn't. I would think that the next

00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:10.100
<v Participant 1>that's kind of goes into when we first started.

00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:12.460
<v Participant 1>Like, you know, hey, if I click on this link,

00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:13.780
<v Participant 1>how do I get this list again?

00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:17.940
<v Participant 1>I wouldn't intuitive, like if I clicked on

00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:19.740
<v Participant 1>here, I would not intuitively know how to

00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:20.900
<v Participant 1>get back to that list.

00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:23.340
<v Participant 2>And is that something you'd want to do?

00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:27.060
<v Participant 1>I think yeah, definitely. First, as I'm first

00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:29.380
<v Participant 1>time exploring, I, I would assume that, hey,

00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:33.540
<v Participant 1>next time I log in or, or if I go back to

00:48:33.540 --> 00:48:38.860
<v Participant 1>the, you know, cut. Cut the web address down

00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:41.180
<v Participant 1>and go back to like the main page, that it

00:48:41.180 --> 00:48:42.620
<v Participant 1>would pop up again.

00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:46.100
<v Participant 1>But if it didn't, then I, I would, I don't

00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:46.380
<v Participant 1>know.

00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:51.520
<v Participant 2>Okay, so it would pop up on, you know, my

00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:53.840
<v Participant 2>va. Like, I think that's the page it's on

00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:56.520
<v Participant 2>top of right now every time you return there

00:48:56.520 --> 00:49:00.600
<v Participant 2>until you press what? X.

00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:10.920
<v Participant 1>Oh, I wouldn't, I would. Welcome to va.

00:49:14.610 --> 00:49:16.050
<v Participant 1>I would think it wouldn't come up until.

00:49:16.130 --> 00:49:18.290
<v Participant 1>Unless like the first time, like when you

00:49:18.290 --> 00:49:22.370
<v Participant 1>log in. Okay. Hell, welcome back. Here's

00:49:22.370 --> 00:49:23.490
<v Participant 1>your list of stuff.

00:49:23.730 --> 00:49:27.330
<v Participant 1>But if I'm sitting down to explore for an

00:49:27.330 --> 00:49:30.250
<v Participant 1>hour, yeah, I wouldn't want to have to log

00:49:30.250 --> 00:49:32.850
<v Participant 1>out and log back in to get it. So I guess

00:49:32.850 --> 00:49:34.530
<v Participant 1>every time you go to the main page. The.

00:49:35.570 --> 00:49:39.220
<v Participant 1>Your dashboard pops up. That would get annoying

00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:39.500
<v Participant 1>though.

00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:45.980
<v Participant 1>Yeah, yeah, Maybe a button, you know. Right.

00:49:46.860 --> 00:49:48.740
<v Participant 1>Games and stuff. They have, you know, do

00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:50.380
<v Participant 1>not do tutorial. So.

00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:52.580
<v Participant 1>But Nike class, you know, do not show me

00:49:52.580 --> 00:49:53.340
<v Participant 1>this anymore.

00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:56.860
<v Participant 2>Gotcha. Do not show me this anymore. Okay,

00:49:56.940 --> 00:49:58.460
<v Participant 2>but if you don't click that.

00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:02.460
<v Participant 1>You'Re every time you go to the, the dashboard

00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:03.460
<v Participant 1>or what, you know, whatever.

00:50:03.460 --> 00:50:06.070
<v Participant 1>This. Yeah, my va. Gotcha.

00:50:06.390 --> 00:50:08.910
<v Participant 2>Okay, I'm gonna go ahead and share with you

00:50:08.910 --> 00:50:12.390
<v Participant 2>a link, a last link.

00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:24.150
<v Participant 2>We have both here now. So after seeing both.

00:50:24.310 --> 00:50:26.470
<v Participant 2>Which one do you prefer and why?

00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:45.000
<v Participant 1>For me right now I prefer the, the one on

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:46.479
<v Participant 1>the right because.

00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:50.480
<v Participant 1>Right. Because I'm not just starting out.

00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:55.360
<v Participant 1>If I'm just starting the transition process

00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:57.400
<v Participant 1>and learning about everything. I definitely

00:50:57.400 --> 00:50:59.560
<v Participant 1>like the one on the, the left because this

00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:02.960
<v Participant 1>kind of helps guide you on. Hey, these are

00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:04.640
<v Participant 1>the things you should be focusing on as you're

00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:05.680
<v Participant 1>transitioning.

00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:12.400
<v Participant 2>Why do you prefer the one on the left for,

00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:13.840
<v Participant 2>for brand new people.

00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:19.760
<v Participant 1>These are things that they need to get squared

00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:23.850
<v Participant 1>away as they're getting out. And again, there's,

00:51:23.850 --> 00:51:26.570
<v Participant 1>there's so much going on during that time

00:51:27.210 --> 00:51:31.490
<v Participant 1>that some, you know, laser focus guidance

00:51:31.490 --> 00:51:33.610
<v Participant 1>on these are the most important things you

00:51:33.610 --> 00:51:35.690
<v Participant 1>need to be focusing right now, at least for

00:51:35.690 --> 00:51:39.290
<v Participant 1>va. Kind of helps them draw priorities.

00:51:42.250 --> 00:51:43.770
<v Participant 2>Gotcha. Gotcha.

00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:53.380
<v Participant 2>I'm wondering would these like this kind

00:51:53.380 --> 00:51:56.780
<v Participant 2>of pop up thing work on other parts of the

00:51:56.780 --> 00:52:01.060
<v Participant 2>website or would they get in the way?

00:52:02.100 --> 00:52:05.060
<v Participant 1>Generally? I'm not, not a big fan. Too many

00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:10.260
<v Participant 1>pop ups. I, I, if it's any more than like

00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:14.830
<v Participant 1>two, I probably start getting annoying.

00:52:15.870 --> 00:52:17.390
<v Participant 1>Yeah, I think there would be a better way

00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:21.430
<v Participant 1>to just design the like the, you know, the

00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:23.630
<v Participant 1>bar that goes on top of the website with

00:52:23.710 --> 00:52:27.190
<v Participant 1>drop downs. Just design that better to be

00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:28.590
<v Participant 1>easier to find the relevant information.

00:52:29.309 --> 00:52:32.350
<v Participant 1>As opposed to pop ups. As opposed to pop

00:52:32.350 --> 00:52:32.750
<v Participant 1>ups.

00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:33.390
<v Participant 2>Okay.

00:52:33.710 --> 00:52:34.270
<v Participant 2>Okay.

00:52:37.630 --> 00:52:47.160
<v Participant 2>Now so of these two versions, is there any

00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:49.680
<v Participant 2>kind of like combination that could work

00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:54.120
<v Participant 2>for you or you really just like them as is?

00:52:58.040 --> 00:53:02.120
<v Participant 1>I mean, you know, combining them, I think

00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:06.000
<v Participant 1>putting the disability link and the, and

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:08.160
<v Participant 1>the education link on the second one to have

00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:12.080
<v Participant 1>a slightly longer list because you know,

00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:13.760
<v Participant 1>for me those are the things I would be clicking

00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:16.160
<v Participant 1>on. But you know, if those are the three

00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:22.000
<v Participant 1>most used areas, then yeah. Having a slightly

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:22.600
<v Participant 1>longer list.

00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:26.120
<v Participant 2>Okay, so five items in the right list.

00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:26.920
<v Participant 1>Yeah.

00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:30.760
<v Participant 2>Go to my VA healthcare disability education.

00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:32.360
<v Participant 2>Discover your benefits.

00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:35.640
<v Participant 1>Yeah. I don't think you lose anything by,

00:53:36.530 --> 00:53:37.250
<v Participant 1>by doing that.

00:53:38.130 --> 00:53:38.610
<v Participant 2>Cool.

00:53:38.770 --> 00:53:43.210
<v Participant 2>Cool. Okay. I think that wraps up the questions

00:53:43.210 --> 00:53:46.290
<v Participant 2>I have. I want to invite our note taker to

00:53:46.770 --> 00:53:48.530
<v Participant 2>ask any questions she may have.

00:53:51.490 --> 00:53:53.890
<v Participant 2>I don't have any questions for today, but

00:53:53.890 --> 00:53:56.730
<v Participant 2>thank you. Thank you so much for your feedback.

00:53:56.730 --> 00:53:59.250
<v Participant 2>It's super appreciated.

<v Participant 1>Thank you. Appreciate it.

00:54:02.230 --> 00:54:04.630
<v Participant 2>Do you have any questions for me as we wrap

00:54:04.630 --> 00:54:05.430
<v Participant 2>up today?

00:54:07.350 --> 00:54:09.350
<v Participant 1>No. Stay warm over there.

00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:11.110
<v Participant 2>Oh, thank you. Thank you.

00:54:11.830 --> 00:54:14.430

<v Participant 2>your feedback. It is so helpful to us as

<v Participant 2>we continue to work on the site, make sure

00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:24.950
<v Participant 2>it works well for veterans. Perigian will

00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:26.710
<v Participant 2>be sending you a thank you note with a little

00:54:26.710 --> 00:54:28.790
<v Participant 2>blurb you can pass along to other veterans

<v Participant 2>you may know to also provide them with a

00:54:30.810 --> 00:54:32.330
<v Participant 2>chance to participate in future research

00:54:32.410 --> 00:54:35.290
<v Participant 2>studies. So keep an eye out for that. And
