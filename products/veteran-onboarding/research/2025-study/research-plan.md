# Research Plan - New Veteran Modal Experience

## Background

New Veterans experience decision paralysis when they first access VA.gov because the site offers so many options and pathways. Without clear guidance, Veterans struggle to know where to start, leading to frustration and potential abandonment of important tasks. We have designed a modal popup that appears for new Veterans after login, offering guided pathways to key actions. We are testing two versions: Version A (Application-focused) presents VA health care, VA disability compensation, and VA education and training benefits. Version B (Exploration-focused) presents Go to My VA, Manage your health care, and Discover your benefits.

## OCTO-DE Priorities

This research supports the following OCTO priority:

- Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits

## Veteran Journey

This product fits into the following moments in the Veteran journey:

- **Getting out** - When Veterans are transitioning from service and need to understand what VA services are available
- **Starting up** - When Veterans are establishing their relationship with VA and accessing services for the first time

## Research Goals

What are you trying to learn from this research?

1. **Understand how new Veterans currently approach VA.gov and what causes decision paralysis**
2. **Evaluate effectiveness and preference between modal design approaches (application-focused vs. exploration-focused)**

## Outcome

How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?

This research will determine which modal version to implement and identify any usability issues to address before launch. Findings will inform the final modal design, content, and implementation strategy to reduce new Veteran decision paralysis and improve first-time user experience on VA.gov.

## Research Questions

1. What are new Veterans current experiences and pain points when first accessing VA.gov?
2. How do new Veterans decide what to do first on VA.gov and what causes them to feel overwhelmed?
3. Which modal version (application-focused vs. exploration-focused) do new Veterans prefer and why?
4. What are the usability issues and pain points with each modal version?
5. How well do the modal options align with new Veterans actual priorities and needs?

## Hypotheses

New Veterans will prefer clear, actionable guidance over open-ended exploration, reducing decision paralysis and improving task completion. Application-focused options (Version A) will be preferred by Veterans who know what they want to apply for, while exploration-focused options (Version B) will appeal to Veterans who are still exploring their options. 

## Methodology

**Comparative usability testing with preference ranking**

45-minute remote sessions combining semi-structured interviews (10 minutes) and comparative usability testing of both modal prototypes (30 minutes). Participants will interact with both versions in randomized order and provide preference feedback with reasoning. Focus on language preferences (application vs. exploration-oriented), readiness state alignment, and confidence impact.

## Location

- Remote

## Research Materials

- Figma prototypes of both modal versions (desktop and mobile)
- VA.gov staging environment for context
- Post-session preference ranking survey

## Recruitment

**Participants:** 16 total

- 8 Veterans who have never used VA.gov before

- Platform testing: 8 desktop users, 8 mobile users

**Inclusion Criteria:**

- Veterans who transitioned from service within the past 2 years
- Either: Have never used VA.gov before OR recently created a VA.gov account (within 3 months, fewer than 5 total visits)
