# Research Goals & Questions
research_goals:
  - goal_1: "Understand how new Veterans currently approach VA.gov and what causes decision paralysis"
  - goal_2: "Evaluate effectiveness and preference between modal design approaches (application-focused vs. exploration-focused)"

research_questions:
  - "What are new Veterans current experiences and pain points when first accessing VA.gov?"
  - "How do new Veterans decide what to do first on VA.gov?"
  - "Which modal version (application-focused vs. exploration-focused) do new Veterans prefer and why?"
  - "What are the usability issues and pain points with each modal version?"

> *Questions about how to set up your research study? Reach out in the [#research-ops](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C0216PL32HJ) Slack channel.* 

## Background üèóÔ∏è

`What problem is your product trying to solve?`

New Veterans experience decision paralysis when they first access VA.gov because the site offers so many options and pathways. Without clear guidance, Veterans struggle to know where to start, leading to frustration and potential abandonment of important tasks.

`Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)`

This is an authenticated experience. The modal popup appears for new Veterans after login, offering guided pathways to key actions.

`What is Veterans' familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?`

This is a new product designed to help first-time and new VA.gov users navigate the site more effectively. We are testing two versions: Version A (Application-focused) presents VA health care, VA disability compensation, and VA education and training benefits. Version B (Action-focused) presents Go to My VA, Manage your health care, and Discover your benefits.

`Product Brief`

**[Link to product brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/veteran-onboarding/product-outline.md)**

### [OCTO-DE Priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202025.md) 

This research supports the following OCTO priority:

`Objective 1: VA's digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.`  

> - **Key Result 1:** Improve satisfaction with our web and mobile products by 5 points.

### [Veteran Journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)

Where does your product fit into the Veteran journey?

- `Getting Out` - When Veterans are transitioning from service and need to understand what VA services are available
- `Starting Up` - When Veterans are establishing their relationship with VA and accessing services for the first time

## Research Goals ü•Ö	

`What are you trying to learn from this research?` 

### Goals

`1.` **Understand how new Veterans currently approach VA.gov and what causes decision paralysis**

`2.` **Evaluate effectiveness and preference between modal design approaches (application-focused vs. exploration-focused)**
  
### Outcome

`How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?`

This research will determine which modal version to implement and identify any usability issues to address before launch. Findings will inform the final modal design, content, and implementation strategy to reduce new Veteran decision paralysis and improve first-time user experience on VA.gov.

### Research questions

**`1.` What are new Veterans current experiences and pain points when first accessing VA.gov?**

**`2.` How do new Veterans decide what to do first on VA.gov?**

**`3.` Which modal version (application-focused vs. exploration-focused) do new Veterans prefer and why?**

**`4.` What are the usability issues and pain points with each modal version?**

**`5.` How well do the modal options align with new Veterans actual priorities and needs?**

### Hypotheses
 
New Veterans will prefer clear, actionable guidance over open-ended exploration, reducing decision paralysis and improving task completion. Application-focused options (Version A) will be preferred by Veterans who know what they want to apply for, while action-focused options (Version B) will appeal to Veterans who are still exploring their options. Both modal versions will result in higher satisfaction and task completion rates compared to no onboarding guidance.

## Methodology üõ†Ô∏è

**Comparative usability testing with preference ranking**

45-minute remote sessions combining semi-structured interviews (10 minutes) and comparative usability testing of both high-fidelity interactive modal prototypes (30 minutes). 

**Version Testing:**
- **Modal Version A (Application-focused):** Three benefit application options - VA Health Care, VA Disability Compensation, and VA Education Benefits
- **Modal Version B (Action-focused):** Three action options - My VA, My HealtheVet, and Discover Your Benefits Tool

**Testing Protocol:**
- Participants will interact with both versions in **randomized order** to prevent order bias
- After viewing each modal, participants will attempt a task completion activity (e.g., initiating an action based on modal guidance rather than simply dismissing the modal)
- Participants will provide preference feedback with reasoning and complete a brief satisfaction rating
- Focus on language preferences (application vs. action-oriented), readiness state alignment, and confidence impact

### Location

- [X] **Remote**
- [ ] **In-person**

## Recruitment üéØ	

### Recruitment approach

We will use Perigean to recruit participants using a maximum variation sampling approach via their recruitment partner, with targeted outreach to recently transitioned Veteran organizations. We are specifically targeting Veterans who are either completely new to VA.gov or have very limited experience with the site (created account within 3 months, fewer than 10 total visits).

   - Qualifying response: Never used it OR created account within 3 months with fewer than 10 visits

3. **Have you completed any of the following on VA.gov: enrolled in VA health care, filed a disability claim, or applied for education benefits?**
   - Qualifying response: No to all three
