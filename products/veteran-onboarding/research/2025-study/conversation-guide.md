# Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is David and **[NOTETAKER NAME]** will be joining us to take notes. Today we're going to talk about some possible new updates to help new Veterans get started on VA.gov.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to confirm with you:

**Screener Confirmations**

Confirming you are on [device]?
If no: If possible, can you join from your [device] please? I can help you re-join, or we can continue if you're more comfortable on the device you're on now.

I have written down that you transitioned from service within the past 2 years. Is that correct?
If no: When did you transition from service?

I have written down that you [have never used VA.gov before / recently created a VA.gov account]. Is that correct?
If no: Can you tell me about your experience with VA.gov?

I'll now go over a few details about today's session...

**This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

**In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.

**Your participation is completely voluntary.** If for any reason you want to stop, or do not want to answer a question, please let me know. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know. You'll be compensated no matter how much of the session we complete today.

**I want to be transparent that my co-workers and I are here in a research capacity only.** We want to hear about your experiences, good or bad, in case there are processes we can improve upon in the future, but we cannot directly impact your benefits in any way.

Knowing this, I have **[#]** teammates who would like to observe our session but are optional. Would that be okay, or do you prefer to keep the session to just the three of us?

If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.

If yes: Admit observers.

Then, ask the observer(s) to give a brief, camera-on introduction, first name and position with VA.gov.

Once complete, ask the notetaker and observer(s) to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth.

Are you ok if I record my screen and audio for analysis and reporting purposes? We like to record to confirm that we've captured your opinions accurately and sometimes share video or audio clips with our colleagues at the VA. Nothing is ever shared outside of the VA. If we do share video or audio we don't share anything that identifies you, such as your name or face.

If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

**Start recording.**

I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?

# Warm-up Questions - 10 minutes

> - Differences between never-users and recent account creators

## First Task: Modal Version A - Application-Focused - 12 minutes

I'm going to show you a popup that appears after logging into VA.gov for the first time. Please share your screen and I'll send you a link.

**Step 1.** Take a look at this popup and tell me your initial thoughts. (RQ3, RQ4)

**Step 2.** Walk me through what each option means to you:
- "VA health care" - are you ready to apply for this?
- "VA disability compensation" - how does this feel as an option?
- "VA education and training benefits" - what's your reaction to this?

**Step 3.** Which option would you choose and why? (RQ3, RQ5)

**Step 4.** The text says "you can apply for VA benefits" and "Most people start with one of these benefits." How does that messaging feel? (RQ3, RQ5)

**Step 5.** Does presenting these as applications feel like the right approach for where you are right now? (RQ3, RQ5)

**Step 6.** Does this feel helpful or like it's in your way? (RQ3)

**Step 7.** On a scale of 1-5, how confident does this make you feel about your next steps? (RQ3)

> [!NOTE]
> ### Things to watch for:
> - Does the participant understand what each option means?
> - Which option appeals to them most and why?
> - Do they see this as helpful guidance or an obstacle?
> - Any confusion about the language or options?

## Second Task: Modal Version B - Exploration-Focused - 12 minutes

Now I'll show you a different version of that popup.

**Step 1.** What are your initial thoughts about this version? (RQ3, RQ4)

**Step 2.** How does the messaging "start exploring VA benefits" feel different from the previous version? (RQ3)

**Step 3.** Walk me through what each option means:
- "Go to My VA" - what would you expect to find there?
- "Manage your health care" - what does this suggest to you?
- "Discover your benefits" - how is this different from applying?

**Step 4.** Which option would you choose and why? (RQ3, RQ5)

**Step 5.** Does "exploring" and "discovering" feel like the right approach for where you are right now? (RQ3, RQ5)

**Step 6.** Does this feel helpful or like it's in your way? (RQ3)

**Step 7.** On a scale of 1-5, how confident does this make you feel about your next steps? (RQ3)

> [!NOTE]
> ### Things to watch for:
> - How do they respond to the exploration-focused language?
> - Do they prefer the specificity of these options?
> - Does this version align better with their current needs?

## Third Task: Comparison - 8 minutes

**Step 1.** Now that you've seen both versions, which one do you prefer and why? (RQ3)

**Step 2.** What specifically about the language appealed to you in your preferred version? (RQ3)

**Step 3.** One version focuses on applying for specific benefits, the other on exploring and managing. Which better matches your current stage? (RQ3, RQ5)

**Step 4.** How ready do you feel to "apply" versus "explore" and "discover"? (RQ5)

**Step 5.** Which version makes you feel less overwhelmed? Why? (RQ3, RQ4)

**Step 6.** The first version says "Most people start with one of these benefits" - how does that guidance feel versus the more open exploration approach? (RQ3)

**Step 7.** If you could change anything about either version, what would it be? (RQ4)

**Step 8.** On a scale of 1-5, how much does each version reduce decision paralysis for you?

> [!NOTE]
> ### Things to watch for:
> - Clear preference and reasoning
> - What specific elements they prefer from each version
> - Whether they see value in guided experiences
> - Any suggestions for improvement

# Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

- What are your overall thoughts on these popup designs we shared with you today?

- Is there anything else you'd like to share about these designs or your experience getting started with VA online?
- Observers, do you have any additional questions?
- Any questions for me?

## Consent to use video clips

I want to circle back and re-confirm that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners? Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.

If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

We'd love to hear what you think about your overall experience of being scheduled and participating in the research session. Could we have done anything differently/better?

Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again and enjoy the rest of your day!
