**Intro - 5 minutes**

Thanks for joining us today! My name is David and **[NOTETAKER NAME]** will be joining us to take notes. Today we're going to talk about some possible new updates to help new Veterans get started on VA.gov.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to confirm with you:

**Screener Confirmations**

Confirming you are on a (laptop-desktop/phone)? Great

- If no: If possible, can you join from your (laptop-desktop/phone) please? I can help you re-join, or we can continue if you're more comfortable on the device you're on now.

I'll now go over a few details about today's session...

**This entire session should take about an hour.** I want to be mindful of your time so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic to keep us moving.

**In this session, I want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; this is not a test of your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.

**Your participation is completely voluntary.** If for any reason you want to stop, or do not want to answer a question, please let me know. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. 

- **If observers**: Knowing this, I have **[#]** teammates who would like to observe our session but are optional. Would that be okay, or do you prefer to keep the session to just the three of us?
    - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
    - If yes: Admit observers.

Then, **ask the observer**(s) to give a brief, camera-on introduction, first name and position with VA.gov.

Are you ok if I record my screen and audio for analysis? We like to record to ensure that we've captured your opinions accurately. Nothing is ever shared outside of the VA. If we do share video or audio we don't share anything that identifies you, such as your name or face.

- If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

**Start recording.**

I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

**Warm-up Questions - 10 minutes**

Before we look at the website, let's start with a few warm-up questions.

**For ALL participants:**

1. What branch of service did you serve in, and when did you transition out?
2. What is your experience with VA.gov?
3. Have you heard of VA.gov? What have you heard?
4. What VA benefits are you most interested in?
5. Are you ready to apply for benefits today, or are you still figuring out what's available? (RQ5)
6. When approaching a new government website, do you prefer to explore first or jump into tasks? (RQ2)
7. What would be most helpful when you first visit VA.gov? (RQ2)

**FOR PARTICIPANTS WHO RECENTLY CREATED VA.GOV ACCOUNTS:**

1. How many times have you visited VA.gov since creating your account?
2. What typically happens when you visit VA.gov? (RQ1)
3. What's been most challenging about navigating VA.gov? (RQ1, RQ2)
4. Are you ready to apply for benefits, or are you still researching what's available? (RQ5)
5. Do you prefer to explore options first or jump into applications? (RQ2)

**First Task: Modal Version A - Apply-Focused - 12 minutes**

I'm going to show you a popup that appears after logging into VA.gov for the first time. Please share your screen and I'll send you a link.

**Step 1.** Take a look at this popup and tell me your initial thoughts. (RQ3, RQ4)

**Step 2.** Walk me through what each option means to you:

- "VA health care" - are you ready to apply for this?
- "VA disability compensation" - how does this feel as an option?
- "VA education and training benefits" - what's your reaction to this?

**Step 3.** Missing?

**Step 4.** The text says "you can apply for VA benefits" and "Most people start with one of these benefits." How does that messaging feel? (RQ3, RQ5)

**Step 5.** Does presenting these as applications feel like the right approach for where you are right now? (RQ3, RQ5)

**Step 6.** Does this feel helpful or like it's in your way? (RQ3)

what would x do? 

**Step 7.** On a scale of 1-5, how confident does this make you feel about your next steps? (RQ3)

**Note**

**Things to watch for:**

- Does the participant understand what each option means?
- Which option appeals to them most and why?
- Do they see this as helpful guidance or an obstacle?
- Any confusion about the language or options?

**Second Task: Modal Version B - Exploration-Focused - 12 minutes**

Now I'll show you a different version of that popup.

**Step 1.** What are your initial thoughts about this version? (RQ3, RQ4)

**Step 2.** How does the messaging "start exploring VA benefits" feel different from the previous version? (RQ3)

**Step 3.** Walk me through what each option means:

- "Go to My VA" - what would you expect to find there?
- "Manage your health care" - what does this suggest to you?
- "Discover your benefits" - how is this different from applying?

**Step 4.** Which option would you choose and why? (RQ3, RQ5)

**Step 5.** Does "exploring" and "discovering" feel like the right approach for where you are right now? (RQ3, RQ5)

**Step 6.** Does this feel helpful or like it's in your way? (RQ3)

**Step 7.** On a scale of 1-5, how confident does this make you feel about your next steps? (RQ3)

**Note**

**Things to watch for:**

- How do they respond to the exploration-focused language?
- Do they prefer the specificity of these options?
- Does this version align better with their current needs?

**Third Task: Comparison - 8 minutes**

- Now that you've seen both versions, which one do you prefer and why? (RQ3)
- What specifically appealed to you in your preferred version? (RQ3)
- One version focuses on applying for specific benefits, the other on exploring and managing. Which better matches your current stage? (RQ3, RQ5)
- Which version makes you feel less overwhelmed? Why? (RQ3, RQ4)

**Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes**

- Is there anything else you'd like to share about these designs or your experience getting started with VA online?
- We were considering other things for this pop up like a tour. What do you think of tours when you get to a new website?
- So imagine you click on one of these, but it’s not the one you meant to click on. What would you do?
    - Do you like the pop up or would you prefer a page?
- Could something like this pop up be used elsewhere on the site?
- On a scale of 1-5, where 1 is Very Unlikely and 5 is Very Likely, how likely would you be to use a feature like this? Why or why not?
- Observers, do you have any additional questions?
- Any questions for me?

**Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes**

Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again and enjoy the rest of your day!
