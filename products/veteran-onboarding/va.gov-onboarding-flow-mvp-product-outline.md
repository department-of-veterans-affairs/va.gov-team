# **VA.gov Onboarding Flow - MVP**

### **Overview** 
The Iterate, Innovate, and Run (IIR) team is leading an initiative to build out a net new onboarding experience for va.gov users. The IIR team plans to create a welcome/onboarding modal that is shown to first time LOA 3 users to help them more easily find, access, and manage the benefits they care about.

### **Problem Statement(s)**
- When Veterans sign up for VA.gov, they aren't told what to do next making it complicated and overwhelming to find and access the benefits they earned.
- The lack of an onboarding experience does not meet government goals of having digital experiences that are “consistent with [the public’s] favorite consumer websites and mobile apps.”

How might we statement: How might we help Veterans take their first step towards applying for benefits. 

### **Desired User Outcomes**
- Reduce user confusion and decision paralysis when they come to VA.gov for the first time
- Users are able to quickly find and apply for the benefits they need

### **Undesired User Outcomes**
- Users don't find the welcome/onboarding modal helpful

### **Desired Business Outcomes**
- Increasing action toward benefit application
- This flow contributes to OCTO's Objective #1: VA's digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits. This flow makes things easier and more efficient for users.

### **Undesired Business Outcomes**
- CSAT scores drop
- Decrease action toward benefit application

### **Measuring Success**
#### 1. Majority of users who see the modal, click on one of the links.

#### 3. No significant drop in CSAT on pages we are linking out to. We don't want our flow to be burdensome to users so we will be tracking CSAT closely.

### **Launch Strategy**

We plan for every user to see this flow - whether they are brand new to VA.gov or not. We will do a slow rollout behind a feature flag so we can closely monitor traffic, usage, and potential bugs. No notifications or comms at this time.

### **Launch Dates**

1. TBD but estimating April 2026
