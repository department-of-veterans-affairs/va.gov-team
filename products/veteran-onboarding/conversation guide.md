**Confirm the participant is ready and begin session**   

### Intro - 5 minutes   

**Moderator:** Thanks for joining us today! My name is Liza and I will be joined by some colleagues who will be taking notes. But before we get to them...Today we're going to talk about your first experience logging into your account on VA.gov. Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:
* This entire session should take about an hour. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
* In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
* Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
* I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?
    * [_If no] Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom._
    * [_If yes] Admit observers._
    * _Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)_
    * _Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth_   

**Moderator:** You'll be interacting with a prototype today. This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. If there’s anything that doesn’t work, please let us know what you’d expect it to do. And since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits. 

Likewise, as a researcher, I cannot provide any advice or guidance around your benefits or experience with VA.   
Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.  
* Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
* Once I hit record, I will ask again, so that we have the recording of the confirmation.
  
_Start recording._

**Moderator:** I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

### Section 2: [My VA: LOA1 Message] - 10 minutes
#### Review
**Moderator:** Now I’d like you to take a moment to review this page. It is a prototype, so in case something doesn’t work like it might on a real site, just go ahead and share with us how you think it should work.   

Please take as long as you’d like to read and explore. If you’re comfortable, I’d love to hear you “think out loud” as you go and share any thoughts. Remember, there are no wrong answers and I will not be offended by anything you share.   

**Questions:**   
1. Does this page look familiar to you? [If Yes] How often have you used or visited this page?     
2. What, if anything, about this page stands out to you?   
3. What were you hoping to find here?
4. Is the information provided what you expected to see here? Why or why not?   
5. What do you imagine this page is used for?   
6. Is there anything here you don’t see that you would find valuable?   

#### Task
**Moderator:** Now that you’ve taken a look at the page, what would you do from here?   

_If the participant would like to verify, tell them to go ahead and do so and encourage them to continue through the simulated "verification" screens, then move on to Section 3 questions. If the participant clicks on the other links, ask them “Where would you expect that link to go?”_   

---
### Section 3: [LOA3 Task List] - 10 minutes
#### Review   
_If the user did not attempt to verify:_    
**Moderator:** Now we’re going to pretend that you’ve gone through the identity verification process that was called out by the green box. Go ahead and click on the “Verify your identity” link.   

_Encourage participant to continue through the simulated "verification" screens_

_If the participant has already ‘verified’ as part of the previous section, move on to probing questions._   

**Questions:**   
1. What, if anything, about this page stands out to you now?

### Section 4: [[Profile Completion](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/profile-completion/discovery-research/conversation-guide.md)] - 15-20 minutes   
#### Review - Entry Point   
_If the participant has not yet moved to add their contact info, prompt them to click the “Add your contact information link” in the task list._   
**Moderator:** Now imagine this was your profile on the website, what would you do from here?   

* _If participant says they’d click on the first task, tell them to go ahead_
* _If the partictipant says they'd click on the "Go to my Profile link, tell them to go ahead._
* _If participant says anything else, ask why that thing, and then guide them to click on the alert_

#### Task - Evaluate steps 0-2 [Add Contact Info Page, Add Email, Add Phone] of the Profile Completion Flow   
NOTE: Entry point could be from Task List OR Profile Page   
**Moderator:** Go ahead and take a look at this page, and tell me what you make of it. Don’t click on anything yet, but I’m curious to know what you’d do from here.   

_Depending on whether they entered via the “Profile” link or the task prompt, they might end up on Profile with the alert or the Add your Contact Information “pre-flow” page with instructions._   

**Questions for Profile Page and Alert**   
1. Does this page look familiar to you? [if Yes] How often have you used or visited this page?
2. What, if anything about this page, stands out to you?
3. Based on what you see on this page, what might you do next and why?

**Questions for Add Contact Information Page**
1. Based on what you see and read here, are you required to provide this information?   
2. What would you expect to happen if you clicked on “remind me later”?   
3. When should “later” be?   
4. How would you expect to be reminded?   

**Moderator:** Thanks for that. Now you can click on things as you normally would, and please remember to think out loud as much as possible so I can understand how this works for you.   

_If needed, instruct participant to click on the "Add your contact information" action link._   
_When participant is on step one (email address) and step two (mobile phone):_ **Moderator:** Since this is a prototype, these fields won't actually allow information to be entered. You can just click on the field to populate text before moving on.   

 _Allow participant to go through the flow. As needed, ask:_   
1. Is the information here required?
2. What would happen if you decided to continue without providing the information?      
3. Do you know how much information you will need to enter or how many screens you'll need to review this task? (Trying to evaluate if they notice and understand Step X of X heading)  
 
 **Things to note**
* Does the participant believe the information is required to move to the next step?   
* What did the participant expect from “remind me later”?
* Was anything unclear or confusing?

#### Task - Evaluate dismissing workflow and remind me later [Mailing Address]   
_Pause participant on step 3 (mailing address)._

**Moderator:** I’m going to pause you here for just a moment to ask a few questions.   
 
**Questions**:   
1. If you changed your mind and wanted to get out of this workflow, would the email and phone number be saved to your profile?
2. On this step, what do you expect will happen if you choose "remind me later" instead of finishing?   
3. If you wanted to return to a previous screen to change information that you’ve already entered, what would you do?    

**Things to note**   
* What did the participant expect from “remind me later”?   
* Did they understand or expect that any information previously entered would be saved to their profile if they exited?

#### Task - Evaluate confirmation page content and return to My VA [Your Contact Information is Updated and Return to My VA]
_If the participant has not yet completed the form to get to the final page, prompt them to go ahead and do so._

**Questions**:  
1. After reviewing the information here, how do you expect VA to reach you with updates?
2. Where would you go from here?
3. If next time you log in, you wanted to review or edit the information you just entered, what would you do?
4. If you wanted to return to the My VA page, where you first saw the task list, what would you do?

**Things to note**   
* Is the participant curious about notification settings as it relates to what they just entered?
* Do they believe they will be prompted to go through the flow again?

_Once the participant has reviewed the page, prompt them to return to My VA by clicking the link, if they have not already done so._   

**Moderator:** Take a look at this page again.   

1. Do you notice anything different about it, now that you have added your contact information?
2. Is there anything else you would do on this page?
3. Once you have completed the second task here, what do you expect would happen to the task list?

**Things to note**   
* Does the participant notice the status has changed?
* Are they interested in completing the second task?
* Do they expect the list to vanish once all the tasks are done or re-populate with new tasks?

### Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes
**Moderator:** Thank you so much for the feedback so far! We're getting close to the end so I have just a few more questions for you about the overall experience today.   

**Questions**:   
1. If you had a magic wand and could fix anything about the overall process for new Veterans setting up their account with VA.gov, what would you do?
2. If you could wave your magic wand and change anything specifically about our process today, what would you do?   
3. Is there anything we didn’t cover today that you’d like to share with me?   
4. Any questions for me about what we covered today?

### Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes
**Moderator:** We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.   
Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

### Emergency Exit   
[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
