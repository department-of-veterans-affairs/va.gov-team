## Overview
The VA.gov authenticated experience thus far has been primarily focused on the user journey for existing Veterans or other VA beneficiaries - i.e. Veterans or beneficiaries who are already active in and relatively familiar with VA.gov by way of claim submission, applying for health care and engaging with other VA-sponsored benefits. We will be performing research and discovery to gather a baseline understanding of the transition process from active duty military to Veteran status, the impact VA.gov can have on the transition process, how a distinct onboarding experience could improve the transition process and what that might look like on VA.gov.
This is in alignment with OCTO objective 1 for 2024: Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.

## Problem Statement
We do not have a defined onboarding experience on VA.gov. We hypothesize that a lack of digital onboarding guidance for newly transitioning Veterans presents challenges in efficiently and effectively getting Veterans the relevant services and resources they need, leading to potential frustrations, delays, and missed opportunities for support and access to eligible benefits

## Desired User Outcomes

- Basic understanding of challenges associated with the transition process, specifically with regard to how VA.gov could remedy those pain points

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Scope creep: we cannot solve all challenges between DoD and VA regarding the process of transitioning from active duty to Veteran status
IIR and AuthExperience team will not be interfering with VES ongoing benefit recommendation work or welcome package


## Desired Business Outcomes

- Before embarking on a large development effort to build an onboarding solution, we need to validate our hypothesis and learn more about the transition process as well as define what a good onboarding experience looks like.
We need to answer the following questions:
- What role does VA.gov play in how people onboard to VA as a whole?
- How can we update VA.gov to make it easier to onboard at VA?
- What does successful onboarding to the authenticated experience on VA.gov look like?
- Benefit eligibility
- Benefit access
- Profile completion
- ???
Does the scope of our approach solely focus on transitioning Veterans or any "new" to VA.gov users (e.g. transitioning MHV users, Veterans who have never used VA.gov) as well?
Other groups and stakeholders, including but not limited to the groups listed below, will likely be interested in our findings. We will need to consult with these groups to share knowledge about onboarding processes so that we are not duplicating efforts.

## Measuring Success


### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
* _What are the most important metrics that track with this product/initiative's success?_
* _Include links to Domo or Google Analytics Dashboards/Reports_
* _**Limit 5-6 KPIs per product**__

| Category | Ease of use | Service completion | Trust/Satisfaction | Health |
|----------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------|
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |

#### Baseline KPI Values
* _Baseline values for those most critical metrics. These may come from other systems other than VA.gov e.g. eBenefits._

## Assumptions
- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumption w/your initial set of functionality*

## Solution Approach

We need to answer the following questions:
What role does VA.gov play in how people onboard to VA as a whole?
How can we update VA.gov to make it easier to onboard at VA?
What does successful onboarding to the authenticated experience on VA.gov look like?
Benefit eligibility

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*
