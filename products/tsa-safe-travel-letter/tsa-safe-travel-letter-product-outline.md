# **Benefit Letter**

## **TSA Safe Travel Letter**

### **Overview**

The Iterate, Innovate, and Run (IIR) team is leading a project that will allow certain Veterans to download and print a net new letter on the /download-va-letters/letters/letter-list page. This letter will allow Veterans who meet certain eligibility critera to enroll in TSA PreCheck for free.


### **Problem Statement(s)**

1. A new law is taking effect that will allow certain Veterans to enroll in TSA PreCheck for free but TSA needs proof of the Veteran's eligibility before enrolling them.


How might we statement: How might we enable Veterans who meet eligibility requirements to prove their eligibility to TSA?


### **Desired User Outcomes**

1. Veterans can self sufficiently download and print a letter to take to TSA via va.gov.


### **Undesired User Outcomes**

1. The only way Veterans can get this letter is by calling the help desk and having them check their eligibility and send it.


### **Desired Business Outcomes**

1. The VA has this functionality on va.gov by January 4th (which is the deadline for when they are legally required to have this in place)


### **Undesired Business Outcomes**

1. VA.gov does not have this functionality by January 4th.
