## **TSA Safe Travel Letter**

### **Overview**

The Iterate, Innovate, and Run (IIR) team is leading an project to allow va.gov users to download and print a net new letter on the /download-va-letters/letters/letter-list page. This letter will allow Veterans who meet certain eligibility critera to enroll in TSA PreCheck for free.


### **Problem Statement(s)**

1. A new law is taking effect that will allow certain Veterans to enroll in TSA PreCheck for free but TSA needs proof of eligibility before enrolling the Veteran.


How might we statement: How might we enable Veterans who meet eligibility requirements prove their eligibility to TSA?


### **Desired User Outcomes**

1. Veterans can self sufficiently download and print a letter to take to TSA


### **Undesired User Outcomes**

1. Veterans have no way to prove eligibility to TSA


### **Desired Business Outcomes**

1. The VA has this functionality on va.gov by January 4th (which is the deadline for when they are legally required to have this in place)


### **Undesired Business Outcomes**

1. VA.gov does not have this functionality by January 4th.
