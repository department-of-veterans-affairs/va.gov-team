# Research Plan for [Education Data Migration, WEAMS Public, 1/14/25]
*Questions about how to set up your research study? Reach out in the #research-ops Slack channel.* 

## Background
Briefly describe the background of your product. Consider:
- What problem is your product trying to solve? WEAMS Public is working to consolidate licenses and certifications, national exams, and programs details for institutions into the Comparison Tool. This will allow users to access education benefits information quickly and easily. 
- Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth) In Comparison Tool and unauthenticated.
- What is Veterans’ familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one? Veterans are familiar with WEAMS Public. We are migrating the information from WEAMS Public into Comparison Tool.

### OCTO Priorities 

Which [OCTO priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202025.md) does this research support? 
- This research supports all three objectives.

### Veteran Journey
Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)?
Are there moments that matter? 
1. Life stage - Putting down roots and moments that matter include engaging VA to access benefits and services.
2. Life stage - Reinventing myself and moments that matter include acquiring the appropriate education, new skills, and credentials.

## Research Goals	
What are you trying to learn from this research? 
With this research goal, we will learn scenarios where users aren't able to find what they are looking, their pain points. From there, we will know how we can provide a more optimal solution.

*Pro tip: Limit 3 goals per study. If you have more than 3 goals, consider how to break up your research into iterative studies.* 

**Here are our research goals:**
1. Identify if users can find the content they are seeking.
2. Validate if users will benefit from the presentation of the WEAMS Public in CT.
3. Discover pain points or aspects of the design that need to be altered to improve the user experience. 

### Outcome
How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?
The next phase is to launch WEAMS Public information within CT. The research will allow us to get feedback from users regarding the language, presentation, functionality, accessibility and we will make changes to our designs from the learnings.

### Research questions
Consider bucketing research questions under research goals. For each question, think about:
- What will I do with what I learn from this question?
- Does this question serve the goals of my study?
- Do not write out all questions you plan to ask participants -- that should go in the [conversation guide.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/conversation-guide-template.md) 

**Here are our research questions:**
1. Are the users able to find what they are looking for?
2. Will the users benefit from the updated presentation of the WEAMS Public in CT?
3. What are the current pain points that users are facing?
  
### Hypothesis
What do you intend to learn and measure from this study? Think through these prompts to develop a strong hypothesis.
- What do you already know about this problem space?
- What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the study, so don’t skip this step!)
- Write a generalized statement that combines what you know + what you think will happen during the study. 
- Remember to constrain the hypothesis to the goals of your study!

**Here is our hypothesis:**
Participants will easily find the information they are seeking if the presentation is intuitive and well-organized. A clear and user-friendly format should enhance the participants comprehension and overall satisfaction with the WEAMS Public functionality within Comparison Tool, ultimately improving their ability to make informed decisions and participate in the program. Participants will share potential gaps or areas for improvement in the presentation that could better meet their needs and enhance their experience. 

## Methodology	
Qualitative usability testing is the research method we plan to execute to test the feasibility of the solution. We will focus on users behaviors, preferences, and overall experiences while interacting with the prototype. This method will involve a small group of participants who represent the target audience. 

Participants will be guided through tasks in the staging environment and will be asked open-ended questions to gather their thoughts and detailed responses about their experience. We will also note down any issues, frustrations, or successes along the way.

### Recruitment approach
Our intended audience is Veterans, Veteran's family member, Veteran's caregiver, or service member.
We plan to work with Perigean for recruitment.

### Screener Questions
1. How often do you go online to access VA benefits and services?
2. Have you looked up a program within an institution in WEAMS Public?
3. Have you ever used WEAMS Public? 
4. Are you comfortable joining the session on mobile or desktop?

### Recruitment criteria
List the total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study.
- Total 15 participants

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study? 
- 10 who have used WEAMS Public national exam search, licenses and certification search, looking up programs within institutions
- 3 who have never used WEAMS Public
- 2 users with PTSD
- 8 users join through desktop
- 7 users join through mobile

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
What criteria would strengthen your results? No secondary criteria.

## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email: Will provide to Perigean 
* Date and time of pilot session: 2/7/25 between 1-3pm EST

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research: 2/10/25 - 2/12/25

### Length of sessions
* Session length: 60 minutes 
* Buffer time between sessions: 30 minutes 
* Maximum Sessions per day: 5 sessions per day

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. *Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.* 

Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.

For all planned dates of research we are available between 9:30am to 4pm EST.
