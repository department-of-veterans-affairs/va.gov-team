*Iterating on a product? Have a new feature? Check out the [Initiative Brief Template.](https://bit.ly/initiative-brief-template)*

---

## Overview
*After you've explored the problem and through testing / hypothesis have identified the ideal solution, write up one sentence describing the solution you'll be creating.*
The Statement of Benefits (SOB) Tool is designed to provide detailed benefit utilization and entitlement information to Veterans awarded Post-9/11 GI Bill education benefits, as well as to surviving spouses or dependents utilizing transferred benefits from qualifying Veterans and active-duty service members meeting specific service criteria.

## Problem Statement
*In a couple of sentences, describe the Who, What, Why, and Where of the challenge / pain point you seek to address. [Here's a sample problem statement definition activity you can try on your team to help generate this](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/problem-framing)*
As a Veteran, I want to determine my education benefit eligibility. 
As a content resource, I want to:
•	Ensure that SOB is enhanced to provide 24/7 access to veterans. 
As a data producer, I want to resolve login, calculation, and data issues.


*Follow your problem description up with a "How might we... _______" statement re-framing that challenge as an opportunity. Don't hint too much at what the solution might be, you should have enough of a focal point here to guide your ideas, but plenty of freedom to think laterally and innovatively as you experiment and prototype later.*

## Measuring Success


### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
* _What are the most important metrics that track with this product/initiative's success?_
* _Include links to Domo or Google Analytics Dashboards/Reports_
* _**Limit 5-6 KPIs per product**__

| Category | Ease of use | Service completion | Trust/Satisfaction | Health |
|----------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------|
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |

## Assumptions
- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumption w/your initial set of functionality*

## Solution Approach

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
- Discover, analyze, and evaluate SOB for functionality.
- Reolve login, calculation, and data issues.
- Dsicover, analyze, and evaluate SOB data and system integrations.
- We're starting here because OIT contracted us to do this work 
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- This approach is best because it will allow us to restore functionality to Statement of Benefits for users and make the website 508 compliant. 
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- Right now we're focusing on restoring funcitonality and effectiveness to SOB. We've opted out of other, asthetic changes to the website and extra features to get a working version out to users as soon as possible. 
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*
- We will make changes based on user testing and CAIA feedback until SOB relaunches. 

### Initiatives
*Include initiatives (iterations, new features, etc.) to improve this product. See the [Initiative Brief Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/product/initiative-brief-template.md)*
