# Research Plan for [Education Data Migration, Yellow Ribbon Tool, 12/23/24]

*Questions about how to set up your research study? Reach out in the #research-ops Slack channel.*

## Background
Briefly describe the background of your product. Consider:
- What problem is your product trying to solve? Yellow Ribbon Program information in CT cards is working to consolidate education benefits into the CT tool. This will allow users to access education benefits information quickly and easily. 
- Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth) In comparison tool and unauthenticated.
- What is Veterans’ familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one? Veterans are familiar with the Yellow Ribbon Tool. We are migrating the Yellow Ribbon Program information from the yellow ribbon tool into comparison tool.

### OCTO Priorities
Which [OCTO priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202024.md) does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed. This research supports all three objectives.


### Veteran Journey
Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)?
Are there moments that matter?

1. Life stage - Putting down roots and moments that matter include engaging VA to access benefits and services.
2. Life stage - Reinventing myself and moments that matter include acquiring the appropriate education, new skills, and credentials.

  
## Research Goals        
What are you trying to learn from this research?
Are the users able to find what they are looking for?
With this research goal, we will learn scenarios where users aren't able to find what they are looking, their pain points. From there, we will know how we can provide a more optimal solution. Within the Institution details page in CT, are users able to find the YR program info and their experience in navigating to that section.
Will the users benefit from the presentation of the YR program information?

*Pro tip: Limit 3 goals per study. If you have more than 3 goals, consider how to break up your research into iterative studies.*

**Here are our research goals:**
1. Identify if users can find the content they are seeking.
2. Validate if users will benefit from the presentation of the YR program information in CT.
3. Discover pain points or aspects of the design that need to be altered to improve the user experience. 

### Outcome
How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?
The next phase is to launch the YR program information within CT. The research will allow us to get feedback from users regarding the presentation, functionality, accessibility and we will make changes to our designs from the learnings.

### Research questions
Consider bucketing research questions under research goals. For each question, think about:
- What will I do with what I learn from this question?
- Does this question serve the goals of my study?
- Do not write out all questions you plan to ask participants -- that should go in the [conversation guide.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/conversation-guide-template.md)

**Here are our research questions:**
1. Are the users able to find what they are looking for?
2. Will the users benefit from the updated presentation of the YR program information in CT?
3. What are the current pain points that users are facing?

### Hypothesis
What do you intend to learn and measure from this study? Think through these prompts to develop a strong hypothesis.
- What do you already know about this problem space?
- What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the study, so don’t skip this step!)
- Write a generalized statement that combines what you know + what you think will happen during the study.
- Remember to constrain the hypothesis to the goals of your study!

**Here is our hypothesis:**
This study aims to assess the effectiveness of the presentation of the YR program information in helping users accomplish two main objectives: (1) determining whether users can easily find the information they are seeking, and (2) evaluating if the structure and delivery of the information are beneficial to users in understanding and engaging with the YR program information in its new location.

Based on previous observations and trends, it is expected that users will find it easier to locate the necessary information if the presentation is intuitive and well-organized. Additionally, a clear and user-friendly format should enhance users' comprehension and overall satisfaction with the YR program, ultimately improving their ability to make informed decisions and participate in the program. Through this study, we aim to identify any potential gaps or areas for improvement in the presentation that could better meet users' needs and enhance their experience.


## Methodology        
Qualitative usability testing is the research method we plan to execute to test the feasibility of the solution. We will focus on users behaviors, preferences, and overall experiences while interacting with the prototype. This method will involve a small group of participants who represent the target audience. 

Participants will be guided through tasks and will be asked open-ended questions to gather their thoughts and detailed responses about their experience. We will also note down any issues, frustrations, or successes along the way.


### Location
This will be a remote research study and we will use Zoom.

### Research materials
*Note: your OCTO/VA lead must review and approve all research materials – including this plan –  prior to submitting a recruitment request.*
Provide a link to any materials you need to run your study, including any materials needed for set up and recruitment.

### Recruitment approach
Our intended audience is Veterans, Veteran's family member, Veteran's caregiver, or service member.
We plan to work with Perigean for recruitment.

### Screener Questions
1. How often do you go online to access VA benefits and services?
2. Have you ever applied for the Yellow Ribbon Program or any other GI Bill benefits?
3. On a scale of 1-5, 1 being satisfactory and 5 being not satisfactory, what was your experience using the Yellow Ribbon Program?
4. Are you comfortable joining the session on mobile or desktop?

### Recruitment criteria
List the total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study.
- Total 15 participants

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study?
- 8 who have used the Yellow Ribbon tool and 7 who haven't used the Yellow Ribbon tool
- 7 who are comfortable joining via mobile, 8 who are comfortable joining via desktop (For mobile users, we would like a separate mobile session. For desktop users, we would like to separate mobile session)
- 25-50 age group

Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants. Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question.
Example: Have you been to a VA urgent care facility in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]
> Tip: The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria. Consider how you could leverage the [lean maximum variation sampling (MVS) approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md#lean-mvs-strategy) by breaking up criteria for your study into multiple cohorts that each isolate one primary criteria. Perigean will consider each cohort as a separate recruitment effort, increasing the chances of meeting all criteria for your study. [Go to an example of the multiple cohort approach.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/research/generative-research-study-1/2020-12.research-plan1.md#participants-and-recruitment)

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
What criteria would strengthen your results? No secondary criteria.

## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person.

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).
A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session.
* Pilot participant email: 
* Date and time of pilot session: 1/3/25 between 1-3pm EST 

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research: 1/8/25 - 1/15/25

### Length of sessions
* Session length: 45 minutes (e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours)
* Buffer time between sessions: 30 minutes (30 minutes recommended to reset between sessions, debrief with team, if a participant arrives late, or a session goes slightly over time)
* Maximum Sessions per day: We can do 5 sessions per day (We all have limits - how many sessions can you and your team conduct in one day considering the session length, the mental strain of conducting sessions, other work you still need to complete in a day, etc?)

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. *Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.*
Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.

For all planned dates of research we are available between 9:30am to 4pm EST.


## Team Roles        
**Please do not include email addresses in this section.** We previously required email addresses. VA's GitHub policy ([see announcement](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/discussions/13)) has changed. VA.gov email addresses cannot be in public repositories.
**Please list the names of people in each role.** In the Slack study channel, send an email and primary phone number for the moderator. Send emails only for the notetaker, accessibility specialist, and observers. If you need Perigean to take notes for you, indicate that next to Notetaker.
