## Overview
This project's objective is to allow State and Tribal Organizations to claim interment (plot) allowances for eligible Veterans buried in a State Veteran's cemetery or on Tribal Trust land, where the burial costs are not covered by other means.

## Problem Statement
VA Form 21P-530a is required to request interment allowance. Current process:  
- Entirely paper-based  
- Delays reimbursements  
- Inconsistent submissions

**How might we allow State and Tribal organizations to submit interment allowance requests online?**

## Desired User Outcomes

- State and Tribal organizations can submit an interment allowance request digitally.

## Undesired User Outcomes

- State and Tribal organizations will prefer submitting a paper request.


## Desired Business Outcomes

- Employees at the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) are able to process requests quicker

## Undesired Business Outcomes

- There is an increased time in processing requests
