# Research Plan for VA Seamless, Live Agent Chatbot, June-August, 2023

## Background
The Thoughtworks team (in partnership with VES, Seamless CX leaders, and VA Call Center stakeholders) are exploring how integrations of chat-based Live Agent services may enhance and enable the experiences of Veterans and their caregivers while interacting with the VA. 

The Thoughtworks team is looking to gather and review any existing research and data and conduct interviews with Live Agents to understand their experiences, the current landscape at the VA and any technical challenges that exist. 

The goal is to identify the gaps and potential gains, and work to develop a playbook that consists of best practices for integrating chat-based Live Agent communications across different departments at the VA. 

### OCTO Priorities 

The following research will support the following objectives:

  - Analyze the current landscape of Live Agents at the VA by consolidating existing research and conducting interviews

  - Understand the reasons why Veterans and their families turn to chat based communication (versus a phone call or email) and the pain points they experience

  - Veterans feel they have a successful experience with a Live Agent (i.e., their concern is resolved, the exchange between the Veteran or family member and the Live Agent is positive)

The research will also help increase these measures:
  - Veterans access to information and benefits

The research will also help decrease these measures:
  - Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution

### Veteran Journey

The need for assistance and clarity from the VA can happen at any time for a Veteran. Veterans and their caretakers have the option of contacting the VA by phone or through VA.gov. The Live Agent chatbot is a part of the Veteran’s user journey as a way in which a Veteran may interact with a VA representative. It allows an additional method of communication.

## Research Goals	

  1. Gain insight into how our current contact center agents who are using text-based live chat today with Veterans are finding the experience.
  2. To understand more about the pain points, potential gains, and areas for improvement. 


### Outcome

We intend for this research to shed light on the current use of text-based live agent chat to communicate with Veterans across different departments.

The goal is for this research to lead to developing a guide of best practices for text-based live chat across the VA.

We will consider what additional technology would be beneficial to enhance the chat-based communication experience and the way in which information is securely stored and accessed.

### Research questions

**Context/warm up questions:**
  - How long have you been a contact center agent?
  - How long have you been working with text-based live chat? do you have prior experience with enterprise chat products (at a call center, outside the gov, at other agency, etc)  Where you doing voice support before text-based chat? If so what do you feel are the tradeoffs?  
  - How would you describe your overall experience in communicating with Veterans through text-based live chat?

**Journey map exploration questions:**
  - Can you walk us through the last time or a recent memorable time you conducted a text-based live agent chat; what happened a) before, b) during and c) after it. What are some of the hard/frustrating parts at each stage and what where the more positive/successful parts at each stage? [The moderator will break this question down and walk the interviewee through it in stages]
  
**Sub question prompts:**  
- What are some common issues or difficulties you face when trying to understand and resolve Veteran inquiries or problems in a text-based format?  
  - Are there any communication or language barriers you commonly encounter while assisting Veterans via live chat? How do you navigate or overcome these challenges? 
  - Have you ever encountered situations where Veterans misunderstood or misinterpreted your responses in live chat? If so, how do you typically handle such misunderstandings?
  - How do they handle "misrouted" (for lack of a better term) chats. That is, if the chat isn't something that's within their purview to handle? Or if the conversation takes a turn? E.g. A homelessness conversation turns into a Benefits conversation.  
  - Do they currently keep notes / data points that they enter into other systems? If previous chats were authenticated, would they find seeing previous chat transcripts helpful on their call (whether from a previous chat in their own or another Contact Center)?

**Holistic perspective questions, if not covered in the journey map discussion:**
  - Are there any additional limitations or constraints of the live chat platform that hinder your ability to provide effective Veteran support?
  - Have you noticed any recurring patterns or themes in Veteran complaints or negative feedback regarding the live chat communication?
  - On a positive note, what aspects of the text-based live chat system do you find most helpful or beneficial in your interactions with Veterans?
  - Are there any specific features, tools, or resources you wish were available to you while engaging with Veterans through live chat? How would these additions improve your workflow or effectiveness?
  - Do you have to manage multiple chat conversations simultaneously? And/or do you have to switch between being ‘on a voice call’ to being on a ‘text based chat’?  How do you manage this context/channel switching? Do you think there are areas where managing this could be improved?  
  - In your opinion, what strategies or approaches could be implemented to enhance the overall Veteran experience in text-based live chat interactions?  
  - What metrics or indicators do you believe should be used to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of text-based live chat interactions? Are there any areas of measurement that you feel are currently overlooked or underutilized? 
  - Are there any particular Veteran interactions or situations that you find more challenging or stressful when handling through live chat? If yes, could you describe them?
  - Do you have access to a knowledge base or resources that assist you in providing accurate and timely information to Veterans during live chat sessions? How effective do you find these resources? if the KB is integrated with their other systems or if it's all swivel chair? What would better integration look like?
  - Do you receive sufficient training or guidance on how to handle various Veteran scenarios and challenges specific to live chat interactions? If not, what areas would you like to see more support or training in?

### Hypothesis

  1. There will be some consistency across each live agent’s journey in how they conduct text-based chat with Veterans and their families 
  2. There will be a number of challenges faced by VA live agents in regards to effectively leveraging the technologies they use for conducting text-based chat
  3. There will be some scenarios where text-based chat works really well and others where is not an ideal channel to use to solve a specific problem or issue. 


## Methodology	

The interviews will be conducted remotely via Teams with participants and will consist of the structured interview questions shared above.
