# Research Plan for VA Seamless, Live Agent Chatbot, June-August, 2023

## Background
The Thoughtworks team (in partnership with VES, Seamless CX leaders, and VA Call Center stakeholders) are exploring how integrations of chat-based Live Agent services may enhance and enable the experiences of Veterans and their caregivers while interacting with the VA. 

The Thoughtworks team is looking to gather and review any existing research and data and conduct interviews with Live Agents to understand their experiences, the current landscape at the VA and any technical challenges that exist. 

The goal is to identify the gaps and potential gains, and work to develop a playbook that consists of best practices for integrating chat-based Live Agent communications across different departments at the VA. 

### OCTO Priorities 

The following research will support the following objectives:

  - Analyze the current landscape of Live Agents at the VA by consolidating existing research and conducting interviews

  - Understand the reasons why Veterans and their families turn to chat based communication (versus a phone call or email) and the pain points they experience

  - Veterans feel they have a successful experience with a Live Agent (i.e., their concern is resolved, the exchange between the Veteran or family member and the Live Agent is positive)

The research will also help increase these measures:
  - Veterans access to information and benefits

The research will also help decrease these measures:
  - Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution

### Veteran Journey

The need for assistance and clarity from the VA can happen at any time for a Veteran. Veterans and their caretakers have the option of contacting the VA by phone or through VA.gov. The Live Agent chatbot is a part of the Veteran’s user journey as a way in which a Veteran may interact with a VA representative. It allows an additional method of communication.

## Research Goals	

  1. Gain insight into how our current contact center agents who are using text-based live chat today with Veterans are finding the experience.
  2. To understand more about the pain points, potential gains, and areas for improvement. 


### Outcome

We intend for this research to shed light on the current use of text-based live agent chat to communicate with Veterans across different departments.

The goal is for this research to lead to developing a guide of best practices for text-based live chat across the VA.

We will consider what additional technology would be beneficial to enhance the chat-based communication experience and the way in which information is securely stored and accessed.

### Research questions

Overarching Research Questions: 
1. What do Live Agents at contact centers experience while communicating with Veterans using text-based chat?
2. What are the common scenarios (both positive and negative) that Live Agents agents navigate while interacting with Veterans through text-based chat?

**Methods**
- Primary research → Interviews with 3-6 Live Agents
- Secondary research → Existing artifacts, research, etc.

**Desired Outcome**
- Greater understanding of the Live Agent’s user journey during common interactions with Veterans
- Learn which technology and systems currently support Live Agent chat-based communications
- Understand the ways in which the Live Agent communications fit into the greater VA ecosystem
- Identify the anomalies or unique challenges that occur
- Learn what are the top pain points, barriers, and areas for optimization
- Learn what enhancements or resources would be valuable to Live Agents and to Veterans
- Gather recommendations for what would improve the Live Agent’s workflow or the Veteran’s experience
- Identify which metrics or indicators would demonstrate success



### Hypothesis

  1. There will be some consistency across each live agent’s journey in how they conduct text-based chat with Veterans and their families 
  2. There will be a number of challenges faced by VA live agents in regards to effectively leveraging the technologies they use for conducting text-based chat
  3. There will be some scenarios where text-based chat works really well and others where is not an ideal channel to use to solve a specific problem or issue. 


## Methodology	

The interviews will be conducted remotely via Teams with participants and will consist of the structured interview questions shared above.

### Recruitment

We would like to schedule interviews with 3-6 participants in order to achieve 3-6 completed sessions. We would like all participants to be Live Agents from the National Call Center for Homeless Veterans. We have worked with one of the Operation managers at the call center to recruit for us. 

  **Recruitment criteria** 
    -  All have a computer, tablet, or smartphone and be willing to be complete their session on one of those devices
    -  During the session, be willing to share a web browser window on their device
    -  Have a working microphone on their device
    -  Have Teams downloaded to their device prior to the session and know how to share their screen

## Timeline
  Beginning June 30th, until 3-6 sessions are complete.
