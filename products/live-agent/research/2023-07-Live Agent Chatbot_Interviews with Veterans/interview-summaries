## Veterans: Interview Summaries

## Interview 1
The Veteran is a 54 year old, white female. She was in the Air Force for 25 years and retired 11 years ago. Currently she is working in a position for the military. 
She has reached out to VA to ask medical related questions and schedule appointments. 
“I typically look online first and I might call, it really just depends if I want to Chat because sometimes it can just be a longer process than you might have anticipated when you are trying to gather some quick information.”
She uses MyHealtheVet to communicate with her care team through the secure message system. When she accesses MyHealtheVet she authenticates her ID through VA.gov login. 
She shared she knows many Veterans who prefer not to deal with VA, especially when it concerns medical care, due to inefficiencies and how the quality of care varies. Her father only began to receive care from VA a couple of years ago. She believes since his generation had the impression that care from VA was inadequate, but this feeling is changing.
When would they like to use Live Chat?
For instances that require an immediate response (such as, acute illness)
For example, the Veteran had a respiratory infection. She asked her local VA medical center if she could come in for medication. Eventually a representative responded through a secure message and advised her to go to Urgent Care. The Veteran already had gone at that stage due to the severity.
She feels Live Chat is preferable if questions are generalized, but Chat may be challenging if someone has a specific question
Suggested use case: Do I qualify for a VA home loan?
When would they prefer not to use Live Chat?
Chat is challenging if it is regarding private information 
She would feel comfortable asking if there is a neurologist close by versus a private medical question
She would feel more comfortable is she authenticated her ID
Areas for optimization:
Veteran encounters different login processes → opportunity to standardize?
Transition to retirement is a stressful time when Veterans are overloaded with information → can Live Chat be an asset during this time period for a Veteran?

Additional Quotes:
“I think [Live Chat] would be helpful, I think it might be a staffing issue for [VA] – having people available to answer the calls and the knowledge to respond (not just medical, burial benefits, or something else). There is just so much they are responsible for. It would be a challenge.”
When commenting on whether Live Chat would be a benefit she shared, “my generation is more tech savvy, my Dad doesn’t like anything on the computer, and the younger generation is way ahead of us so I think [Live Chat] would be very helpful”.

## Interview 2
The Veteran is a 66-year-old, black man, who is retired from the Air Force. He is currently working fulltime in an IT related position. He has been involved with VA due to health issues and a disability.
The Veteran regularly calls VA to check on his benefits claims. He can see a certain amount of information on VA.gov, but since the information is not updated in real time, he calls VA once a month to see if there is any progress that is not visible in the system. He has found his own ways to manage the inefficiencies that he comes across.
He has experience with Live Chat since recently VA sent him an email inviting him to try out the revised Chat. He logged on and talked with a nurse in cardiology. He was pleased to learn information that was valuable for an upcoming doctor's appointment. For this interaction, the Veteran had used his fingerprint to sign in through ID.me.
He voiced that he feels VA is in a better place now. For example, before community care existed, it was challenging to get a medical appointment. He feels VA is evolving and he notices a marked improvement. He feels that he is able to get the help that he needs but feels it requires a lot of work on the Veteran’s side. 
He shared, “I believe they take care of you, but you need to know how to use the system.”
He shared that he found his way to VA benefits because a friend of his wife works as an RN and they encouraged him to apply. His entry point to VA benefits was through knowing someone who was connected to VA. He felt he may not have found out about the benefits otherwise.
When would they like to use Live Chat?
Wait times can be very long, usually on call when he is at home, and can be 35-1hr until they hear from someone
Veteran would give the pharmacy’s phone line an A+ , due to short wait times, they locate the Veteran automatically and they thoroughly answer questions (would give the rest of VA a C-)
When would they prefer not to use Live Chat?
When he finds something out through Live Chat, he validates the information by reaching out to his PCP through a secure message 
Areas for optimization:
Save and send a transcript of conversation to the Veteran
Challenging to consolidate medical records from different VA centers and civilian providers

Additional Quotes:
“I do not want to talk to someone, I want to get onto the system and get what I need”
“To get to the Chat I have to do some kind of authentication – would not be comfortable without that happening – you do not know who is on the other side. If they mention something you haven’t told them”

## Interview 3
The Veteran is 66 year old, biracial (Latino, Black, and Caucasian) man, who retired from the Army in 1998. Since that time the Veteran feels that interactions with VA have been relatively great, especially, he feels he has increased access to VA. He commented that he often will get a reply from VA within 24 hours, when it used to take months.
_“From ‘98 to today it has been a journey, it is awesome in the last few years, the interactions with VA has been awesome, because the communication channels they have opened up.”_
He is in contact with VA almost weekly for medical related concerns. He reaches out to VA anytime he needs something concerning his medical equipment, appointments, tests, imaging, etc. 
He feels fortunate to be a Veteran and have access to VA medical care and benefits. He feels that the care he receives from VA is superior to his wife who sees civilian providers.
He appreciates having MyHealtheVet and other avenues to reach out. He has noticed improvements VA has made since he has retired.
The Veteran shared his experience with Live Chat. He has often shifted to Chat out of frustration with calling into VA. With phone calls he found that he was on hold for quite a while and sometimes it would 
take an unreasonable amount of time to connect with a representative.
He finds it is convenient to have the option to Chat versus call since he can multitask while Chatting. Even though it takes longer to type everything out, with Chat he has time to read his message and make sure it is what he wants to say. Talking on the phone takes longer for him due to the language barrier and his accent, along with other factors. The downside to Chat is that he is not able to change or edit what he has sent and that he doesn’t get to see the reaction of the other person.
When would they like to use Live Chat?
It all depends on the situation whether a Chat or call is preferable for quick answers, or for needing more detailed help 
He feels he is an open book and open to talk about any topic (outside of health)
When would they prefer not to use Live Chat?
If it is something very specific about their health – the Veteran would rather be face to face 
Areas for optimization:
Community care letters process – snail mail vs secure message

Additional Quotes:
“I am glad I am a Veteran..I get better service than my wife does, she uses civilian insurance”
“We have quick access to VA, where I’m upset if I don’t get answer in 24 hrs, when it used to take months”

## Interview 4
The Veteran is a 73 year old, biracial (american indian or alaska native and caucasian) man, who retired from the Army in 2004. Due to a disability he enrolled in VA healthcare services directly after he was discharged.
He primarily reaches out to VA for healthcare related matters, although he has also reached out for information regarding a mortgage and small business loan.
Due to moving to different parts of the country, he has had difficulties with his medical record being spread out across different medical centers. He has felt that he has almost needed to start over from scratch when he has moved to a new place. 
The Veteran has had two experiences with Live Chat at VA. When visiting a VA webpage a bubble popped up with a message from a Live Agent offering help. He also had a Live Chat with a nurse when he had COVID regarding his eligibility for the antibodies treatment. In both instances he learned relevant information and felt as though he had a positive experience.
Since he does not live directly close to a VA center, he feels it is beneficial to have multiple methods of communication to be able to reach out to VA. He appreciates that he was able to access Live Chat after standard hours and reach someone at 8pm on a Sunday.
He shared that “with Chat there may be more opportunities to be successful if you get someone who is dedicated to what they are doing – they may run around and do some research for you, versus if you walked into someone’s office (a Chat message may be more of an impetus to seek out resources)”.
When would they like to use Live Chat?
To source information on various VA offerings 
To learn about details that may not be clearly displayed on VA.gov
For time sensitive matters (when he had COVID he was able to talk with a nurse about the antibodies treatment and if he was eligible, the Live Agent did not know but said he would get back to him, the Live Agent called an hour later to let him know he should move forward with treatment)
Use case: Reschedule appointments (Veteran spent 45 minutes on the phone during a vacation to try to reschedule an appointment)
When would they prefer not to use Live Chat?
No use cases provided 
Areas for optimization:
Challenging to consolidate medical records, the Veteran had to make copies and physically hand them to a doctor at another hospital → Is there a way to send medical records as an attachment through Live Chat or through secure message?
Would like to be able to save a record of the Chat (though he can take a screenshot)

Additional Quotes:
“If Chat can eliminate the burden for some patients and providers that would be terrific”
“VA offices are fairly regional, anything that can save someone from driving to Richmond to sign a form, or talk with someone face to face, etc, would be well worth it for someone living in northern VA”

## Interview 5
The Veteran is a 35 year old, biracial (Asian and Black) woman, who is retired from the Army. She has been receiving medical care from VA since 2021. She visits VA website to refill prescriptions, schedule appointments, and message her PCP team. 
She didn’t realize Live Chat existed until a couple months ago, when she noticed that you can talk with someone via Chat when she was on MyHealtheVet. She was glad to see this as an option since when she calls VA the line is often busy. She feels she would be able to schedule an appointment much more quickly through Chat, than if she were to call.
She appreciated how a record of her Chat was automatically saved to her account in MyHealtheVet. When she entered the Chat, the Live Agent’s name popped up and she could see the status of the wait time. She spoke with a nurse who did a pre-screen and asked her triage questions, so when she got to her appt, the majority of the information was already filled out.
_“I enjoyed being able to connect with someone live right away and that it wasn’t a robot. 	Someone on the other end is there to help you.”_
She is happy with VA communications overall and would score VA an 8/10. She notices that sometimes the system is down for maintenance mode or the system is busy, and it can be tedious to navigate VA’s online environment because of all of the different links. However, overall she is happy.
When would they like to use Live Chat?
Appreciates she can message her PCP and care team for appointments, refills, etc.
Also feels Live Chat is beneficial for scheduling medical care, help with claims, questions about the PACT act
Suggested use case: checking on the status of a claim
When would they prefer not to use Live Chat?
Anything medical wise she would like to hear directly from her physician or nurse since they are familiar with her and her history. It is more comfortable to hear directly from her health care team simply because usually within certain tones that you can hear inflections in their voice
When it comes to pay, because you need to disclose your acct and routing #, she would prefer a phone call
Areas for optimization:
When the Live Chat is closed, the link is grayed out → is there an opportunity to display Live Chat more prominently so that Veterans can’t miss it as an option?

Additional Quotes:
“Phone is always my number one option, but the other day I was waiting for a while”
“[Live Chat] sort of shocked me since the person answered so quickly”
