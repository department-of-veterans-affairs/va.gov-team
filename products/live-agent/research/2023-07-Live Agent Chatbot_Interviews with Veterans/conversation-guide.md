# Conversation Guide 

## Intro - 5 minutes

My name is Emma and Taylor is taking notes. We are Experience Designers, we are part of a research team at the VA who have been tasked with envisioning what the future of chatting with a Live Agent would be at the VA. And to do this we wanted to talk to Veterans who have first hand experience in communicating through chat with Live Agents at the VA. We want to learn about each step of the process and what has been positive about this way of communicating with the VA but also what could be better in the future. Specifically for you as an Veteran, how could the VA deliver a better experience for you?   

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.**  I want to be sure not to keep you any longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic. Really appreciate time you taking out of your day to meet with us. 
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**
    - We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.
    - The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - We are not sharing screens or using video recording.
    - If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

- I  have a couple of other colleagues here who would like to observe, if that is okay?
- Thatâ€™s ok? If so, I'll go ahead and admit them into the room.

**Start recording.**

- **OK, I am going to hit the record button.**.
- I wanted to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 
- Great, let's begin.
