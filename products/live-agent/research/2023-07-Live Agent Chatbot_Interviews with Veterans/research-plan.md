# Research Plan for VA Seamless, Live Agent Chat, Interviews with Veterans, July 2023

## Background
The Thoughtworks team (in partnership with VES, Seamless CX leaders, and VA Call Center stakeholders) are exploring how integrations of chat-based Live Agent services may enhance and enable the experiences of Veterans and their caregivers while interacting with the VA. 

The Thoughtworks team is looking to gather and review existing research and data and conduct interviews with Live Agents and Veterans. Through interviews with Veterans we are hoping to understand their experiences, pain points, and recommendations for improving interactions with text-based live agents and enhancements to the systems or technology.

The goal is to learn about gaps and areas to optimize from Veterans to inform recommendations for best practices for how to integrate chat-based Live Agent communications across different departments at the VA and to develop recommendations for effective and successful interactions between a Veteran (or their caregiver) and a Live Agent.


### OCTO Priorities 

The following research will support the following objectives:

  - Analyze the current landscape of text-based chat communications with Live Agents the VA by consolidating       existing research and conducting interviews with Live Agents and Veterans
    
  - Understand the reasons why Veterans and their families turn to chat based communication (versus a phone call   or email) and the pain points they experience
    
  - For Veterans to feel they have a successful experience with a Live Agent (i.e., their concern is resolved,     the exchange between the Veteran or family member and the Live Agent is positive)


The research will also help increase these measures:
  - Veterans access to information and benefits

The research will also help decrease these measures:
  - Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution

### Veteran Journey

The need for assistance and clarity from the VA can happen at any time for a Veteran. Veterans and their caretakers have the option of contacting the VA by phone or through VA.gov. The Live Agent chat is a part of the Veteran’s user journey as a way in which a Veteran may interact with a VA representative. It allows an additional method of communication.

## Research Goals	

  1. Understand how Veterans and their families would want to leverage a chat experience, how it works for them       today [in the VA and outside of the VA], and in what instances they would not want to use a chat experience.
  2. Map out what a Veteran’s experience journey would look like if they were to leverage a live chat                 experience; considering the different archetypes and variance in the problems to be solved, what does the        happy path look like?  


### Outcome

The goal is for this research to lead to developing a guide of best practices for text-based live chat across different departments at the VA.

We will consider what additional technology would be beneficial to enhance the text-based chat communication experience and the way in which information is securely stored and accessed.


### Research questions
1. What are the reasons why Veterans and their caregivers reach out to the VA for resources? What are the positive and negative aspects they experience when sourcing information through text-based chat with a Live Agent?

- **Research Method**: 1x1 Interviews with Veterans
  
- **Desired Outcomes**: 
  - Map out the common reasons why Veterans and their caregivers are reaching out for information or resources
  - Learn about the advantages and disadvantages of communicating with Live Agents through chat

2. Where is there room for improvement in text-based chat interactions with VA Live Agents? What would indicate a successful experience?

- **Research Method**: 1x1 Interviews with Veterans
  
- **Desired Outcomes**: 
  - Gather recommendations from Veterans on whether they feel anything could be improved in text-based chat conversations with Live Agents or with the technology 
  - Learn what a successful interaction looks like to a Veteran and what indicators may be used to measure success


### Hypothesis

1. There will be some consistency across each Veteran’s journey in how they reach out for help to find information from the VA 
2. There will be a number of challenges Veterans experience in regards to effectively sourcing information or resources that they need
3. There will be some scenarios where text-based chat works really well and others where it is not an ideal channel to use to solve a specific problem or issue. 



## Methodology	

The interviews will be conducted remotely via Zoom with Veteran participants and will consist of the semi-structured interview questions shared in the conversation guide.
