## Research Goals

The Thoughtworks team (in partnership with VES, Seamless CX leaders, and VA Call Center stakeholders) are exploring how integrations of chat-based Live Agent services may enhance and enable the experiences of Veterans and their caregivers while interacting with the VA.

The need for assistance and clarity from the VA can happen at any time for a Veteran. Veterans and their caretakers have the option of contacting the VA by phone or through VA.gov. The Live Agent chat is a part of the Veteran’s user journey as a way in which a Veteran may interact with a VA representative. It allows fod an additional method of communication.

The Thoughtworks team is looking to gather and review existing research and data and conduct interviews with Live Agents and Veterans. Through interviews with Veterans we are hoping to understand their experiences, pain points, and recommendations for improving interactions with text-based live agents and enhancements to the systems or technology.

The goal is to learn about gaps and areas to optimize from Veterans to inform recommendations for best practices for how to integrate chat-based Live Agent communications across different departments at the VA and to develop recommendations for effective and successful interactions between a Veteran (or their caregiver) and a Live Agent.

* Understand how Veterans and their families would want to leverage a chat experience, how it works for them today [in the VA and outside of the VA], and in what instances they would not want to use a chat experience.

* Map out what a Veteran’s experience journey would look like if they were to leverage a live chat experience; considering the different archetypes and variance in the problems to be solved, what does the happy path look like?

## Research Questions

* What are the reasons why Veterans and their caregivers reach out to the VA for resources? What are the positive and negative aspects they experience when sourcing information through text-based chat with a Live Agent? 
* Where is there room for improvement in text-based chat interactions with VA Live Agents? What would indicate a successful experience

## Methodology 

We conducted a lean qualitative study to understand how Veterans and Contact Center Live Agents experience live chat. We combined the ‘Jobs to be Done’ methodology with qualitative interview methods. Enabling us to build journey maps and pinpoint the positive and negative moments along the Veterans and Contact Center Live Agent journey. These journey highlights will help us prioritize the areas for further analysis in phase 2. 

We spoke to a limited number of Veterans due to time constraints on the engagement duration, but through the lean principle of diminishing returns, meaning from even just speaking to 5 participants, you may learn the same number of insights as compared to interviewing 30; however, the larger number would enable you to validate your learnings. As such, we recommend validating the learnings found here as part of phase two. 


## Hypotheses and Conclusions

H1: There will be some consistency across each Veteran’s journey in how they reach out for help to find information from the VA
   * Definitely True; Veterans contacted VA through a similar process and through similar channels.

H2: There will be a number of challenges Veterans experience in regards to effectively sourcing information or resources that they need
   * Definitely True; Veterans voiced a number of obstacles with communicating with VA (long wait times, siloed VA departments)

H3: There will be some scenarios where text-based chat works really well and others where it is not an ideal channel to use to solve a specific problem or issue.
   * Definitely Tue; Veterans prefer communicating through chat for most issues, but prefer other methods of communciation for certain scenarios, such as medical care.

## Key Findings

1. Veterans prefer Live Chat to calling in the majority of scenarios

2. All Veterans raised concerns about privacy and security

3. Veterans wish for fast access to support

4. Veterans and Live Agents desire a more connected experience

5. Authenticating Live Chat interactions builds trust


## Details of Findings 


**Veterans prefer Live Chat in the majority of situations**

A hypothesis we had was that Veterans may find Live Chat to be inadequate in sensitive or stressful situations. However, we found Veterans prefer Live Chat in the majority of situations they tend to reach out to VA for. 

Matching what we heard from Live Agents, Veterans shared that sensitive topics can actually be easier to discuss through Chat than by phone since it allows the Veteran the ability to take their time responding as needed, yet there is still a human on the other side who can empathize with their situation.
Calling in to VA can take up to an hour or more at times, and the Veteran may have to sacrifice this time while on hold. However, if the Veteran is on Live Chat, they are able to multitask, which is advantageous to Veterans who are engaged in their workday or caring for their families.
Veterans shared some inquiries are complex or very detailed and may require a discussion over the phone. There was consensus among the Veterans that they would prefer to hear directly from their medical providers since they have awareness of their history. 

> _“During work hours it is more convenient to Chat versus wait on the phone. I can do other things while I’m on Chat.” - Veteran Interview 3_

> _“Anything medical wise I would like to hear directly from my physician or nurse since they know me…It’s more comfortable for me to hear directly from my health care team because I can hear tones and inflections in their voice.” - Veteran Interview 5_

**All the Veterans raised concerns about privacy and security.**

Veterans voiced that they feel more comfortable discussing certain topics through Chat if they are asked to authenticate their ID prior to starting the Chat. Veterans place a high value on their privacy and expect VA to have systems in place to protect their information. 
Additionally, Veterans expect for Live Chat at VA to perform similarly to Live Chat they come across on other websites. They wonder why VA is not able to locate who they are automatically, since this is a feature, they often run into on Live Chat.


**Veterans wish for fast access to support.**

Live Chat is key to improving Veteran satisfaction as it is the most effective way to reduce contact wait times. In a 2021 survey, nearly 40% of Americans reported experiencing wait times of more than five minutes when calling a federal agency [Rogerson, Comm100]. Contact centers at VA have reported that call wait times can be up to an hour at times. Instead, Veterans can often reach a Live Agent through Chat in under a minute. Live Chat increases the ability for Veterans to access VA and request support. Veterans appreciate being able to reach someone and resolve their inquiry in much less time than by phone or secure message.

**Veterans and Live Agents desire a more connected experience.**

Veterans desire a universal VA Live Chat experience. Veterans encounter a different Live Chat experience depending on what department they reach, based on the Chat software the Contact Center is using and their protocols. 
Veterans would prefer a standard log-in process, the ability to be transferred to another department when needed, and for the system to locate who they are automatically, among other features.

> _"It needs to be tailored to my information and VA information, but I've never found that. Where is my payment, when is my next appointment?... If they could do that, that's what I want them to do." -MCT Omnichannel Experience Co-Design_

On the Live Agents side, they juggle multiple systems. They have the Chat program, CRM, VA intranet, and other resources open on their screens. They desire a more streamlined, integrated workflow that does not require as many programs and manual steps.

**Authenticating Live Chat interactions builds trust.**

Concerns with privacy and security surface frequently in interviews with Veterans. Authenticating the Chat interaction helps to increase the trust Veterans have to share information. Authenticated Chat is not appropriate for all departments at VA, but there is opportunity to consider where and when to authenticate to enhance Veteran trust and satisfaction.

Furthermore, authenticated Chat allows the Live Agents to locate and access the user’s profile and information. Veterans prefer when they do not need to share as many personal details and the Live Agent can personalize the Chat to their unique needs. [See: VHA Virtual Agent Research]


## Recommendations

* Given the research performed and the insights gleaned, stronger integration across Contact Centers would greatly aid the Veteran experience across the entire VA landscape.

* Enabling this is a matter of creating a platform that provides strong connections to consumers of the data, and allows Contact Centers to independently, and through self-service, create more enriching Chat experiences.
  
* Similarly, a closer integration of Live Chat between Channels is something Veterans have told us they desire. This aligns with the goals of the Seamless CX program.
