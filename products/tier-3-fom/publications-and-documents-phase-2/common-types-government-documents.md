# Common types of government documents and publications

Not all of these will necessarily map to what's common at VA. However, it's another way to start tackling this. We know that VA has "handbooks," "fact sheets," "policy manuals," and "annual reports." We know there are others yet to be discovered. There appears to be multiple database sources for publications and documents; it's also likely that many documents are not managed from a repository but individually uploaded to TeamSite pages, the way leadership bios are today.

### VA appears to have multiple 'consolidated' experiences and backend data respositories or databases for documents, as well as having ad hoc individually uploaded documents by each office directly to their site pages.
