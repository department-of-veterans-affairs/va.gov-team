- Product Outline

# Product Outline

## Overview
The Online Offices Directory will provide a searchable structure on which to build Tier 3 content in addition to making the organizational structure of the VA accessible to all visitors.

## Problem Statement
Main drivers for creating an online Offices Directory:
1) The bulk of content sought by non-Veteran visitors from other government bodies (i.e., Tier 3 content) needs to be modernized in order to make it more useful and findable, thus indirectly serving Veterans.
2) Some content that was known to most directly affect Veterans (i.e., Tiers 1 & 2) remains on the less-accessible legacy TeamSite platform due to the modernized CMS's perceived lack of support for some 3 content types.
3) Visitors trying to understand how the VA is structured can only find that information in a PDF called the Functional Organizational Manual (FOM) – see bottom of [this page](https://www.va.gov/VA-Functional-Organization-Manual-2020-4.pdf).

How might we create a more usable office-finding experience, and at the same time create a foundation for the migration of important content listed above?
 
## Desired User Outcomes

- Visitors of all kinds can find VA organizations and Offices easily.
- All Tier 1 & 2 content is unified and organized under a unified, consistent user experience.

## Undesired User Outcomes


## Desired Business Outcomes

- Office stakeholders perceive a foothold on the modernized CMS platform from which to modernize content they consider important.

## Measuring Success


### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- Reduced downloads of FOM PDF (functional org manual)
- Increase in % of users clicking-through to an Office landing page compared to existing traffic on [About VA > VA Organization page](https://www.va.gov/about_va/organizations.asp)
- Increased user flow from clicking "About VA" menu option through to an Office detail page (i.e., within our Online Directory; many such detail pages will offer a link out to an Office's existing/legacy landing page if it exists)


#### Baseline KPI Values

TBD

### Objectives and Key results (OKRs)

- Objective: Modernize remaining VA.gov content to promote clarity, accessibility, and governance in a manner that optimally serves Veterans.
  - Key result: TBD
  - Key result: TBD

## Assumptions

TBD

## Solution Approach

- We will first build a proof-of-concept Office Directory based on an integration with the FOM database. Change management and disruption to user experiencd should be minimal. Also we can start understanding our users, whose behavior today is largely unknown since the information is in a PDF.
- As we monitor user behavior, we expect to add content types that will enable a first group of 3-4 "Pilot Offices" to migrate remaining Tier 1 & 2 content to the modern (Drupal) CMS.

### Initiatives
*Include initiatives (iterations, new features, etc.) to improve this product. See the [Initiative Brief Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/product/initiative-brief-template.md)*

- TBD

## Go-to-market Strategy

For the first iteration of the Office Directory we don't expect any go-to-market requirements, since we will integrate with an existing data source and process (the FOM) and we're replacing an existing web page with another in-place.
