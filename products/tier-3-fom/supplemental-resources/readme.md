## Supplemental resources

This folder contains examples of tier 3 document types found on VA.gov such as announements/remarks, policy statements, directives, notices, manuals, annual and other kinds of mandated reports (like financial/budget, etc.). These are common government publication types and some, not all, are mandated to be pulicly available (e.g. annual financial reports must be public). 

The folder also includes supplemental information related to the FOM data in Salesforce - like how authorities are formatted by FOM content coordinators.

## Types of tier 3 documents/contents

Tier 3 document/content types include announements/remarks, policy statements, directives, notices, manuals, annual and other kinds of mandated reports (like financial/budget, etc.). 

Most of these are today published as Word, Excel, or PDF documents. Phase 2 of tier 3 content strategy will be to find a way to help consolidate the IA for how these types of mandated contents are access online; and provide a way to begin publishing these types of information as web pages rather than as PDFs/Word (while, likely, still providing a way for users to save the page as a PDF).  Today, much of these types of contents are ad hoc uploaded page by page in a dispersed, decentralized manner. 

Ex: Most people would have no idea that the annual VA budget to Congress (legally required) is located on the [Office of Budget web page](https://www.va.gov/budget/products.asp), as there is no centralized search/library for finding 'corporate' agency contents of this type today.

### Examples of how governament sites digitize and/or centralized tier 3 contents

VA regulations - OALC regs page: https://www.va.gov/oal/library/vaar/index.asp

Gov.UK - can search for all or link to a pre-filtered documents/contents search index page for a particular office: https://www.gov.uk/search/all?organisations%5B%5D=the-coal-authority&order=updated-newest&parent=the-coal-authority  and 
https://www.gov.uk/search/guidance-and-regulation?order=updated-newest

Canada VA - https://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/about-vac/publications-reports/reports  (appears manually curated)

U.S. State Department reports - https://www.state.gov/department-reports/ - appears manually curated - in the IA but hard to find: About> Administration > Departement reports and publications
