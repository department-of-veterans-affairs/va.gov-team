## Action Items
 - [ ] Kristen work with design team for other research methods that don't require 1:1 facilitated moderation with veterans
 - [ ] Kristen to discuss with Leadership and Perigean to see what options are being done to improve no show rates - as too many hours /team members time is waisted with a less than 50 % show rate.
 - [ ] Keep asking in all team meetings with our partners what their timelines are for any dependencies and blockers we have to ensure they know we are waiting for them and to align our roadmaps for a target go live date.
 - [ ] Ming scheduling SMEs to meet with team for HealthRecords discovery and priorities.
