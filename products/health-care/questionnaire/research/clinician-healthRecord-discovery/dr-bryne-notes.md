# Dr. Bryne-specific Interview Questions
We only got through the Demo, Medications, and Immunizations questions.

## Demo
Just getting general feedback

## Health Record Questions
### Warm-up Questions
- We’ve talked before about how patients share updates with you during their appointment and how your office uses the PVS. Is there anything else about how patients currently report changes to their allergies, medications, and immunizations to you that we should know about? This could include a new allergy, medication, or immunization that was diagnosed/prescribed/given outside the VA…maybe even the COVID vaccine. This could also include knowing that a Veteran stopping taking a medication.
- What have you noticed Veterans struggle with when communicating medication, allergy, and immunization changes with you?
  - Are there any types of information that you wish Veterans shared with you more, such as immunizations from outside the VA, supplements or OTCs that they are taking? We are asking, because we heard from Veterans that these are topics that sometimes don’t cross their mind to share with their VA providers. Has that been your experience or has your experience differed?
- If you had a magic wand, what would you want to improve about the process of getting updates to medications, allergies, and immunizations from your patients?
- Can you discuss what you might do differently or be improved in your workflow if you knew a patient had received their COVID vaccine from outside the VA (so that information isn’t in Vista)?

### Medications
- When a Veteran is reviewing their medication list, what compliance (if the Veteran is taking their medication as prescribed or not) information is important for you to know?

  - If yes, what pieces of data should they be able to request edits for?

## Check-in Questions
- Where do your patients check-in? At a central check-in? At a primary care only area?
- What check-in methods are available to your patients? (Kiosk, in-person, etc)
- What have you heard from patients about their check-in experiences?
- Can you describe the rooming process in your office? (Rooming is what I’m used to clinical staff calling this portion of the appointment process - everything from check-in until the doctor actually seeing the patient. Since our pre-visit questionnaire exists in this space, we already covered parts of this with him, but not the entire rooming process.) 
  - Who is involved?
  - What systems do you and/or your staff utilize? 
  - How do you know when a patient is in the room ready to see you? 
- What do you like about the current rooming process? 
- What don’t you like about the current rooming process?
- What could we do to improve the rooming process for you? For Veterans?

## Wrap-up Question
- In the context of a digital pre-visit questionnaire, do you think we are missing anything about immunizations, allergies, and medications? Currently, we are allowing Veterans to edit and add, but should they be able to do anything else?****
