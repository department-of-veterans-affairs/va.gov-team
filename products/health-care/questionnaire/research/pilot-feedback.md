# Feedback from Pilot 
This is a list of all feedback from internal team members, pilot site staff members, and Veterans about the pilot launch. The feedback is not categorized or prioritized. This is just a place to capture all feedback.

1. When I look at the Completed tab on the Questionnaire Manager, it only has the date I submitted my questionnaire. It does not show the date of my appointment. If you have submitted your questionnaire responses, the user does not have context of which appointment the completed questionnaire is associated with.  You don't know the Appointment date until you click and view the PDF.
It would be helpful for the user if they can see the appointment date and the submission date on cards in the Completed tab.
