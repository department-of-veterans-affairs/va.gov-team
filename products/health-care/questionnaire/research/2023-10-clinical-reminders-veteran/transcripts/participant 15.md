Participant 15 BHL, email 
[Brackets are notetaker comments/observers] 

Moderator (M): Past questionnaire experience? 

Participant (P): Yes. I have. 

M: How were you notified about these questionnaires? 

P: A text message link. 

M: Only way? 

P: I don’t remember getting an email at all. 

M: How far in advance? 

P: Two days prior.  

M: Types of questions? 

P: If my emergency contact changed. If I lived where I lived? Any symptoms of COVID? 

M: Standard pre-check-in questions? Any questions that didn’t seem like they were standard questions? 

P: I don’t recall. I may have last time, but I don’t know. What I have been noticing is the pre-check-in questions. 

M: Enough time? 

P: Yes, but I don’t like it. What is the person at the front desk doing then? You did all the work for them. It isn’t personable. When you go to the doctor’s office, they greet you and ask if anything changed. It doesn’t take more than a minute and a half, but it is a person-to-person interaction.  

M: Didn’t check in with anyone at the desk? 

P: Yes. I didn’t have to. It was so impersonal. 

M: What else went through your head? 

P: Do they even care? I can’t think of another word to explain my feelings, but impersonal. I’m just another cog. I’d prefer a face-to-face with another receptionist. 

M: Enough time? 

P: Plenty of time. 

M: Would you want to receive at a different time than you did? 

P: Nah. That doesn’t matter. 

M: Was two days enough for you? 

P: Yeah. 

M: [Shares BHL email] 

P: My overall impression is due to spam issues unless that I knew this was coming from VA. I’m going to go to my secure messaging and make sure that this is coming through there. I’m going to check that they did send this. Now that I can see at top that it says that it is coming from va.gov. That would assure me that it definitely came from them.  

M: Anything that you would change? 

P: No. It is giving me that it is 96 hours to do this and other information. Probably within 72 hours would be good. 

M: Estimated time to complete? 

P: I would hope not more than 10 minutes. If it is longer, then I may not do it. If it is that important, then why aren’t they making an appointment with me? I would like to know more about what this pertains to. Your health, this condition. I know that they want to be careful in case you get hacked, but something. 

M: [Shares prototype] 

P: [Reads intro page] I would add any questions during the process.  

M: Scale 1 -5? 

P: Very very easy, so it is a 1. [Reads sexual orientation question] To me, they need to know if you are a biological female or male to take care of you. Rating 1. [Reads homelessness question] No (comments). Rating 1. [Reads food insecurity questions] Easy. Still a 1. It is good because they can call social services if you don’t have money for food. [Reads second food insecurity question] This is redundant. This is asking the same thing in a different way. 

M: Rather not see it? 

P: Doesn’t matter if it is the second question or the first question. Rating 1. [Reads toxic exposures (TES) intro page]….[Notetaker missed this due to answering questions from social worker. Reads second TES question] Easy. 1. It isn’t overly worded.  

M: Comprehensive enough? 

P: Yes. It is an overview. It should be an overview because you are going to meet with your provider. They will do those details. It is ok because it is specific and general at the same time. I don’t want it to go further into symptoms. [TES follow-up question] It is self-explanatory. It is a 1, but these aren’t follow-up questions if I’m going to be seeing my provider about it. Maybe it is something that I want my provider to look up before an appointment. But why where I do benefits, enrollment, or registry questions with my doctor. Unless I totally misunderstood this.  

M: Wouldn’t want to see those options? 

P: Yes. Because they aren’t relevant to my appointment with my doctor. They don’t’ deal with enrollment. That is my VSO. Maybe there is another question about “have you signed up for the registry yet?” The only one that really applies is health questions. Rating 1. [Reads TES last page]  

M: Feel about this page? 

P: Confused? At the beginning, it says that we are preparing for your appointment. I understand why you are asking why you are exposed, and it isn’t in your history already, then the doctor is preparing you for. Why I’m asked these questions, because I was preparing for my appointment. It is confusing. 

M: Any terms? 

P: It seems like it just doesn’t belong here. 

M: Where would it belong? 

P: Not in these questions, because this is just information. It is understandable. Rating 1. It is just confusing. Maybe at the bottom of the other questions, when it asked you the question there could be something that comes up saying that you’ll receive more information. [Reads tobacco] Why not include these [speaking to the text about vaping, etc.]. It almost makes the Veteran say that these don’t affect my health, but there are studies out there that they do. Rating 1. [Reads TBI] Rating 1. Straight forward. [Reads embedded fragments] I think that it is good that it mentions it ahead of time. You already know and you don’t need another slide to show it.  

M: Any terms that are confusing? 

P: No. Rating 1. I would maybe put another category and a space to put other.  

M: Would you say that it isn’t comprehensive enough? 

P: Yes. Rating 1. [See loading symbol] Is it supposed to do that? [Final page] That worries me. Why did I go through this for seven minutes and my care team might not have it. That worries me.  

M: What do you think would happen? 

P: Within 24-48 hours, I would hope that my care has that response. Why did I go through this if they didn’t get it? Or don’t comment on it? 

M: Has that happened in the past? 

P: Yes. The doctors just asked the question again. Why am I repeating myself? I just wasted my time when I did that beforehand, so why do it again? 

M: Changes? 

P: Change the wording to “your doctor will discuss these responses with you at your appointment.” Don’t put it on the Veteran. I’m not going to remember. A week later, I’m going to go we didn’t talk about it. If they see something concerning, then they should bring it up. They should say “I see that you just asked that. I expect these to be reviewed before my appointment and my provider to bring anything concerning up. Don’t put it on me. I’m not going to remember when I’m there. If I answered to something that is concerning and they don’t bring it up, there is a problem there. In readability, it is easy. It is a 1.  

M: Happen next? 

P: I’ll go to my appointment a day or two later and only with how it is worded that some of my problems might not get addressed, because I may not remember. It has happened.  

M: If you could change one thing about any of the questions or content? 

P: I think just that the questions that are redundant…consolidate them. 

M: Did answering questions beforehand impact quality of the appointment? 

P: I’m not sure. I understand how this could help. The one time that I answered questions and I left the appointment, then I realized that we didn’t talk about it. I had to send a secure message. I had to ask what do we do now. Quality then…no my whole health wasn’t taken care. I didn’t think about it until 24 hours later. 

M: Impact on responses? 

P: No.  

M: Too many? Not enough?  

P: Just right. As long as it doesn’t take more than 10 minutes of my time, then it is ok. 

M: Ideal time for you is ten minutes? 

P: Yes. In the old days, they told you to arrive 10-15 minutes early to answer the questions.
