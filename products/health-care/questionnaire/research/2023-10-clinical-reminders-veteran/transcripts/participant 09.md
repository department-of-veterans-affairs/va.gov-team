# Participant 9 BHL, Text 
[Brackets are notetaker comments/observers] 

M: Past questionnaire experience? 

P: I think so. Not any of my recent appointments. I have a lot of appointments. I go to a lot of different appointments. I remember answering questions over the phone. 

M: Anything via text or email? 

P: I’m trying to think because I get all of the appointment texts. I just started going to the endocrinology appointment, but I didn’t have it yet. 

M: [Probes on the phone questions.] 

P: The provider actually called me. I scheduled the appointment for like a month out and the provider called me a month out. 

M: Do you remember what types of questions? Something like your past history? 

P: Not recently. 

M: Do you feel that you were given enough time to answer these questions prior to your appointment? 

P: Yes. 

M: Would you have wanted more time to answer these questions? 

P: I don’t think so, but I didn’t know the questions before they call me. The provider called me themselves, which is unusual. 

M: Received at a different time? 

P: That would be helpful. Maybe a week before hand.  

M: Would you have like to see those questions beforehand? 

P: Yes. I’m I think that my response would have been more well-rounded. I sometimes have difficultly recalling information quickly over the phone. 

M: [Shares BHL text message] 

P: Immediately, It looks like other texts that I get from the VA. I generally don’t look super close at them. The majority of the texts that I get are links to virtual appointments. This is longer, so I would probably stop and read it. I see that there is a link, so that is easy to follow. 

M: Anything unclear? 

P: The BHL.va.gov.  

M: You want the acronyms spelled out? 

P: Yes. If it was my first time interacting with this clinic, then I wouldn’t know what it was. [Spelling it out] would let me know that what this was. 

M: Any changes? 

P: The Msg&Data rates may apply isn’t useful to me. I’m sure that it is required. Msg frequency varies as well. It doesn’t mean anything to mean as well. 

M: Knowing how long this would take in advance? 

P: That would be helpful. If it is an hour that would be good to know compared to an hour. 

M: [Shares BHL prototype link] 

P: [Reads sexual orientation question] I have seen this question before. 

M: Any opinions? 

P: No. 

M: Anything confusing? 

P: No. 

M: Scale 1-5? 

P: This one was very easy, so 1. [Reads housing screeners. No comments or suggested changes. Rates as a 1. Moves onto next housing questions] I don’t think that I’ve ever been asked this question before, so it is making me think about the future. Pivoting from my usual answers to thinking about the next two months. It just takes a little bit more to think about. Rating 1. [Moves into food insecurity questions] I would select never true.  

M: Anything unfamiliar? 

P: No 

M: Scale 1 -5? 

P: 1 [Moves onto next food insecurity questions. Nothing confusing. Rates as a 1. Moves onto toxic exposure] It seems unnecessary to click ok. 

M: Can you elaborate on why? 

P: It is not a choice. It is an acknowledgment. Maybe it would be better to say “I acknowledge” this. 

M: What do you think of the list on this page? 

P: I have heard about all of these things. They are all things that I would think would be here. 

M: Scale 1- 5? 

P: 2, because I’m annoyed at the ok. [Goes to next page] Oh no, it is another ok. [Reads, then clicks ok] 

M: Anything confusing or unfamiliar? 

P: I’m trying to figure out what is going on from the last slide to this. It is already clear that I’m answering a survey about toxic exposure. It helped me know that this section is about toxic exposure. I would like maybe a section or title at the top. I like the % completion at the top, but I didn’t know how this fits into the overall flow. I would just change the title or better flow. 

M: Anything confusing? 

P: No. Rate as a 2. [Reads first toxic exposure (TES) question] I would say “Don’t know” I’ve never been categorized into any of these specific things, but I do think that during my time in service that I was exposed to things, but I don’t know. 

M: How could it be more helpful? 

P: Expand on the other such exposures? Do you think that there were other such exposures. I can’t think of examples. 

M: Scale 1 -5? 

P: 2 [reads TES follow-up questions] First, I’m wondering if you can select multiple. It would be good if it said that you can select multiple or select all that apply. I don’t know what registry questions are. It is the first time that I’ve seen registry questions. 

M: Scale 1-5? 

P: 2 [Reads TES final page] I’m assuming that by clicking ok that I’m acknowledging. It is weird that that acknowledgment instruction is in the middle of the paragraph, but that is what I’m actually doing. It is confusing by having it in the middle of the paragraph. [Moves onto tobacco screener] I’m assuming that is a typo [referring to dup]. I’m assuming that you mean dip. I’m familiar with everything else. Rating 1. [Moves onto next tobacco question] Rates as a 1. [Moves onto TBI]  

M: Anything confusing here? 

P: Ummm…I feel like I’m recalling. It should maybe be more clear what this means. Like a timeframe or a location. If it is “Did you deploy after Sept 11, 2001,” then yes. But, it could be more detailed. Rating 1. [Reads TBI question. Nothing confusing. Moves onto event question.]  

M: Anything confusing? 

P: No. rating 1 [Moves onto embedded fragments screening] maybe since I’ve already gone through a different subsection, it is more clear to me that I’m entering another subsection. Having something at the top to let me know that would be good.  

M: Anything confusing? 

P: I have never heard of this program [TEFSC]. 

M: Do you feel like you need to know that to better answer these questions? 

P: Yeah, I think that is good to know, but I think this information is good enough. It says that you’ll get more information. Rating 1. [Reads first embedded fragments question. Not comments. Rating as a 1. Get a loading page.] This is strange. [Gets Thank you page] That is pretty standard. Standard reminder. 

M: Any additions to the final page? 

P: I would like to see more information from the questions that said that were was going to be more information. There was the one program that said that I was going to get more information here. 

M: What manner? 

P: In a link, because it would be helpful to be all in one screen. 

M: Anything else? 

P: More information about my care team. Just to bring it back around that these responses were for a pre-review with this care team. I assume next is that I’m have an appointment or would speak with my care team. 

M: Expectations on what happens next? 

P: From this screen nothing.  

M: From the whole survey? 

P: I’ll have an appointment with my care team. 

M: Where will this go? 

P: To my care team, but I’m not sure. In the survey, it talked about a registry and some other things. It makes me wonder if my name is going on another list somewhere. I wonder if I’m going to hear from another team or department. If my name is going somewhere, I would like to know if I’m going to hear from them or a link to whatever information. 

M: Would this match with what happened in real life? Did provider acknowledge those questions? 

P: I don’t know that any provider has ever acknowledged my answers to questions like this. 

M: Change anything about the whole experience, then what would you change? 

P: The time expectation at the beginning of the survey and an overview of the questions. 

M: You noticed that there was progress bar. How helpful or not helpful was that? 

P: It was helpful. I’m thinking about the differences between some sections having a time expectations and other sections not. I don’t know where I am on the progress bar with that time expectation. 

M: Would you expect these questions to impact the quality of the appointment with your provider? 

P: No. I feel like a provider has never directly discussed my answers to questions like this. I wouldn’t anticipate it changing anything. 

M: Answering questions online compared to office? 

P: Probably. In the office, it is never fun to sit and wait. When you have to answer questions too, there is too much going on. I find at home that I have more time to answer thoughtfully. 

M: How far in advance would you want to answer these questions? 

P: A couple of days to a week. I want it to be close to the appointment. I can think about the appointment and be thoughtful. Knowing how long this would take, then I can plan when you answer the question. Maybe it is a week ahead that you can answer these questions and there is a reminder a day to two before that you haven’t answered the questions. 

M: Ideal number of questions? 

P: It depends. In this scenario, I’m taking it before I go to a new clinic or provider. I would say no more than 5 to 10 minutes. 

M: Any final thoughts?
