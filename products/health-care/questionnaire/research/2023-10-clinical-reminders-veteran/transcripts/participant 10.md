Participant 10, eScreening, Text 
[Brackets are notetaker comments/observers] 

Moderator (M): Past questionnaire experience? 

Participant (P): Yes. I have. 

M: How were you notified? 

P: I received a text message and I’m pretty sure and email. I’d have to go back and check.  

M: Do the normally send both? 

P: Yes 

M: Like both? 

P: Yes, because sometimes it is easy to lose a text message. I can go back and look in my email. 

M: Timing? 

P: [Notetaker missed answer] 

M: Types of questions? 

P: How I’m feeling? Am I in any pain? It helped, because he was able to ask some specific questions as a follow-up. 

M: Timing? 

P: I was given plenty of time. It was current too. A couple days was plenty of time. If it is specific questions about the appointment, then 48 hours/a few days is a good about of time. That is also normally when I get a reminder that I have an upcoming appointment, so it syncs well. 

M: [Shares eScreening email] Anything unclear? 

P: Not at all. I think that it is good that it identifies that it is a VA eScreening. VA things tend to come from the same number. Identifying VA eScreening first lets you know that it isn’t a hoax or something. The link also has va.gov in there. It isn’t something else outside, like medical.com. I do look for that. It is basic security stuff. 

M: Estimate on time to complete? 

P: It depends upon what I’m going to. I would say that it would depend upon 7-10 minutes. If it is longer than 10 minutes, then I’m probably answering a lot of questions. It depends upon what they want to know. If it is a follow-up then I would be expecting it. If it is an initial meeting, then I’d probably get bored or not do it. 

M: [Share eScreening prototype] 

P: [Reads homelessness screener] Do you want me to hit “Save and exit”? 

M: Terms that are unfamiliar? 

P: Not at all. 

M: Scale 1 -5? 

P: I think a 1. Very easy. [Reads food insecurity questions] I don’t think anything is missing from there. Rating 1. [Reads toxic exposure (TES) intro page] I think that see that this won’t change your benefits. This is commented on in a lot of channels, so it is good to see that. I know that nobody cares about the paperwork reduction act, but you have to have it in there. This is a little repetitive for me. We already have to register for the fire pit exposure, so I would maybe ask if you were already signed up for the burn pit exposure. This does annoy me, because you already asked me those questions when I went through the burn pit registry. It seems like it is duplicative in this second question. The burn pit survey was very long. You had to provide where and when there. If you put “did you register for the burn pit exposure,” then I could answer these if I only answer no to that question.  

M: Opinions on these choices? 

P: What defines radiation? What is considered an exposure? [They mention providing dates as an example] I have gone through the burn pit registry, so I know what all of these are, but someone who goes through this the first time might not know what these are. I do, but maybe not everybody does. There information sources…it doesn’t really say what these are. What is the purpose of these links? Maybe it is something that if you want to provide more information. I’ve been down most of them. Am I supposed to click on them in the middle of the survey or not? There is nothing saying what they are there for. [Talks about “All patients who report…” wording] isn’t the purpose of this a pre-questionnaire for an appointment with my provider. This wording is more for a registry. This experience is supposed to be followed up with by my provider. In the beginning, it said that this information is going to go to my doctor. This information is kind of annoying. It is just more information for me to read. I’d probably just blow it off. In my head, I’d be like people aren’t talking to each other. It is similar to the burn pit registry comment. If I did that already, why am I getting this again. I wonder why it is telling me to call the Veterans Benefits Administration when this is for an appointment. It makes me question the system. Is this truly a pre-appointment thing or is it taking me down another path? 

M: How easy? 

P: Very easy. Well, that is not true. When you spoke about these categories, I understand, but what if others don’t. It needs more information. If I have follow-up questions, why are you asking me now and not at the end of the survey. 

M: Scale 1 -5? 

P: 2 or 3. From a system standpoint, I’d say a 5. It doesn’t follow flow in how a normal survey goes. [Reads embedded fragment screener] Is this an initial event for me? This makes me feel much like the last one. If I’m going to my annual appointment, then I have already been screened by the VA, which is how I got my benefits. Why are you asking me again? So maybe the questions should be and it depends upon when you are asking me. If I’m doing my annual physical and I’ve been out of the army for 5 years, then I’ve already answered this. Why are you asking me again? I’m now questioning how is the VA medical records tracking each other. If I had my physical and determining my disability rating, then these are already answered. Maybe this is something like “do you have any retained fragments are that weren’t previously reported?” This doesn’t seem like a pre-visit question.  

M: Do you find it weird in a pre-visit questionnaire? 

P: Yes. They should know this. 

M: Would you rather not see this? 

P: Yes. If this is a pre-appointment screening, has there been any changes to your health? Have you already registered for the pit burn exposure? Do you have any new retained fragments that haven’t been previously recorded? 

M: Scale 1 -5? 

P: It is super easy to understand. I don’t worry about what it means. I’m just trying to understand the logic in asking it. [Goes to TBI screener] Again, why are you asking me this? It is in my medical record. I’m trying to understand the logic in asking this question. I feel like you are wasting my time. I do have TBI. Should it be in my record? These seem like they are very generic. It isn’t getting at my individual care and any new changes. Maybe going into my very first appointment, then I would ask these questions. If I got this for my February appointment, then I don’t know why I’m wasting my time with this. I’m not naïve; I’m sure these are stock questions. I want these personalized to the appointment. I want a list of questions that really focuses on what has changed since my last appointment. These just seem like I’m filling out my initial claim. 

M: Rating 1 -5? 

P: 1. It is very easy, but not logical. [Reads about tobacco screener] This one is different because there could be a change. This is a pretty common question. This could change, but it makes more sense. It is still a 1. Really simple and easy. This is a good example that something changed since my last appointment that would be important for the doctor to understand. [Clicks finish] I like how it says that my next appointments are. It is getting me starting to think about it. The “You may ask to meet with your provider…” at the bottom doesn’t make sense, because I thought that I was filling this out because I have an appointment. Maybe there is a final question, is there anything that you would like to talk to your provider about at this appointment? When you click yes, then here is a link that you can go to. This wording makes me question, because I’m already meeting with my provider. If I click on this, then shouldn’t they already be ready to meet about it. I’d like to check off what I’d like to talk to them about. [Wants the list on this last page to be a checklist that they can let the provider know more about what they want to talk about].  

M: Knowing all of this, what do you think will happen next? 

P: It will go to my doctor. Whatever I put in here will help tailor my appointment to my up-to-date concerns. If I say that we need to talk about my hearing aids, then we can talk about it or they can give me more information on who to talk to about that. This list is just other things that can happen. It should be more proactive in its statement and question. It should help better prepare the intake nurse or doctor. In some places, if I’m at [certain VA locations] then they get me more information on where to go in get more information in the building. This is just information instead of a proper interaction with your provider and you to get proper care. 

M: Change one thing what would it be? 

P: I’d change the logic of the survey. It could be more interactive and not be about things that I’ve already done. Except for tobacco, it isn’t about anything new.  

M: Impact quality of the appointment? 

P:100% I do. If the questions are done properly, then I feel that my doctor can tailor a little more what is going on. What are my changes in health? What are my concerns? This way they don’t have to go over administrative stuff. It is a change that we need to address instead there is no change in my hearing. We could not waste time with things that we could preemptively avoid. 

M: Answering online or in-person? 

P: It would be the same. 

M: Too many or just right? 

P: Based upon the questions asked, it was too many. Nothing that I’ve answered here do I feel would help me in my appointment. If it changed and it asked me questions that were pertinent, then I think that it would be helpful. In its current form, it is too many questions. 

M: Amount of time? 

P: 5-10 minutes. Anything more than 10 minutes is probably too long.
