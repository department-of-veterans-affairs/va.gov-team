# Participant 6 BHL, Email 
[Brackets are notetaker comments/observers] 

 
Moderator (M): Past questionnaire experience? 

Participant (P): I don’t recall. My last appointment was last May or June. 

M: [Probes more.] 

P: They may have. A letter was sent in the mail. They may have sent something at that time. 

M: [Shares email] 

P: [Reads the email. No comments.] 

M: How far in advance would you expect to receive this? 

P: If the appointment is already set up, then I would expect a notification about a week in advance and one closer to the appointment (a day or two before). 

M: Anything unclear? 

P: No. It makes perfect sense. I’m familiar with MyHealtheVet. I have used that for a while to send messages. 

M: When do you think that you would click on the link? 

P: If I needed to renew prescriptions or message my provider. 

M: How do you understand this notification? 

P: I think that it is just a reminder that help is there when I need it. 

M: Add or delete anything to the notification? 

P: No, I don’t think that there is anything that I would change about it. [Doesn’t understand the meaning of the email] 

M: [Shares BHL prototype] 

P: [Reads sexual orientation] What a shame has the country come to this that this is a question for a medical appointment? Whether it… 

M: You find it frustrating, because I don’t think that it is relevant to my medical appointment? 

P: When I signed up to for the VA, it was obvious that I was a male. I don’t know why I need to keep answering these questions. 

M: Scale 1-5? 

P: 1. I see no purpose of the question, because when I signed up I was obviously a male, so why do I need to keep asking these questions like this. 

M: Scale 1- 5 after first page? 
 
P: 1. [Reads next page] No, I’m not worried about housing. 
 
M: Relevant to healthcare appointment? 

P: That is a difficult question and hard to decide. I guess that it has more to do with the Veterans that don’t have stable housing. I think that it has more to do with them and the VA can get them resources. 

M: Scale 1 -5. 

P: 1. [Reads food insecurity questions] 

M: Any terms confusing? 

P: No, I think that it is really straight forward. 

M: Scale 1 -5? 

P: 1 [Moves onto second food question]. This is straightforward with good terminology. [Moves onto toxic exposure]  

M: Thoughts on TES intro page? 

P: It is ok. I’m on the Agent Orange registry. It has been documented and I’m receiving disability for it. Other Veterans have gotten burn pit exposure. I wonder if there are any Veterans who haven’t been made aware of this. It is good terminology and easy to understand. I’ve seen other PACT Act notifications in other documents. 

M: Scale 1 -5? 

P: 1 also. [Keeps reads toxic exposure]  

M: What do you think of all of this? 

P: I don’t know if it is all necessary. For legal reasons, I guess that they need to know about the paperwork reduction act. I always get confused when there is an email address until I have a pen and paper that I have around to write it down. 

M: What would you take away? 

P: I’d write down the phone number and I’d move the email address to the end of the survey where I can leave comments at the end. 

M: Scale 1 -5? 

P: 3.  

M: Why? Anything else that you haven’t mentioned? 

P: No 

M: [Continues reading toxic exposure] 

P: Yes. All straight forward terms here. Rating as a 1. [Reads the next toxic exposure question] I’d chose Agent Orange. Some trash was burned when I was there. I’m not aware of any health-related affects. [Reviews each choice. Thinks it might be hard for others and explains what they think that they might have been exposed to.] 

M: Would you like Asbestos to be one of the options here? 

P: Yes. For anyone in the Navy, there are lots of asbestos used in the ships. 

M: Any changes? 

P: Specifically list asbestos. [Goes to the next page] Here is where I would enter asbestos. I think that it needs to be here. If you add asbestos to the other list, then you would still need other for other exposures. If you had it on the other screen also, then the screen will get cluttered and be too much. I would rate this screen as a 1, because it should follow the other screen. [Goes to TES follow-up question screen] There are a lot of choices, but they are all important questions. Now, would be the time to let them know that you have questions. In that regard, I think that is a good screen for myself if I was getting ready for my appointment. I’d click “no questions at this time.”  

M: Anything confusing? 

P: No. You might be trying to group too many things together. If this is for a medical appointment, then benefits/claims questions might not be answered at my appointment. If this is for an appointment, then I’m already enrolled, so I don’t understand the healthcare enrollment question. I’m not sure why the other questions are available here. I’d keep the “health/medical questions,” but get rid of the benefits and health care enrollment options.  

M: You think that they are irrelevant in this context? 

P: Yes. 

M: Does it bother you that they are here now? 

P: They are irrelevant. 

M: You’d rather not see them at all? 

P: I’d give them a 5. 

M: 5 is very difficult to understand. 

P: I’d give it a 1 then. They are easy to understand, but I don’t think that they should be there. [Reads TES last paragraph]. It is a straight forward explanation. Good reassurance and well worded. I’d give it a 1. [Moves onto tobacco] I don’t think that should be dup. This is a standard question when you seek any type of medical care. You need to change dup. 

M: So that is an unfamiliar word. 

P: Yes [Former user question] Rate as a 1. [last time used tobacco question] Straightforward question. I’d rate it as a 1. [TBI screener] No. rate as a 1. [Embedded fragments screener] That is the first that I’ve heard of this embedded fragment screening. It makes sense. If you answer this positively that you will receive some follow-up. It is easy to understand what it is about even though I’m not familiar about it. Even if you never heard of it, then you understand what they are referring to. Always in the military, they use acronyms. It is good that they spelled it out. Rate as a 1. [Have embedded fragment question]  

M: How do you feel about the acronyms there? 

P: I’m familiar with those. Any military dealing with enemy fire would understand those. Again, a 1. It is an easy-to-understand question. [Got an error that the questions weren’t sent to the provider] 

M: How do you feel about getting this screen? 

P: Good, because it lets you know that the questionnaire is finished. It also lets me know that it didn’t send to the provider and I have to try again. 

M: How do you feel about it? 

P: It doesn’t have to do about the questionnaire. It has to do with the connection, so it isn’t the questionnaire’s fault. 

M: Would you try again? 

P: Yes. If it tells me this, then I would try again. 

M: Pretend that it was sent to your provider. What would you expect to happen next? 

P: I would think that it would go to my specific provider. I go to community care, so this would somehow transfer electronically to my provider. 

M: You expect that they would talk about it at your next appointment? 

P: Yes. I would expect them to follow through depending upon how I answered. 

M: Past experience? 

P: I don’t recall specifically having the questionnaire sent to me before my last appointment. If I had questions about prescriptions or vaccines. I have always used the secure messaging and they have always gotten back to me in a few days. I would expect that they would follow through with this as well. 

M: Overall rating 1 – 5? 

P: 1. I’m retired, so I got all kinds of time. It was easy. Except for the wording in the few places that we talked about. 

M: Impact quality of appointment? 

P: It should impact it in a positive way. It gives me time to think about what I want to bring to their attention. I can explain some things. It might save some time. I don’t have to fill it out on a clipboard. I could spend more time in a face-to=face discussion. 

M: Like having it before the appointment? 

P: Yeah. I’m an old curmudgeon that I like things face-to-face, but this could help. So, I need to get with the times and do things online. I’m not surprised that VA is going to this. I also go to the Mayo Clinic and they went completely to this where I can check-in online and fill out these things online. 

M: How soon before appointment would you want to receive this? 

P: Email is good. As long as email provider and get it to me in a smooth trouble-free fashion. Maybe a week ahead of time. 

M: Would answer on own time impact responses compared to answering with provider? 

P: I think that it would allow me to take my time. 

M: # of questions? 

P: There were a lot of questions, but it is similar to any other medical questionnaires that I have had to fill out. It was ok. 

M: Ideal time? 

P: If it goes past 10-15 minutes, then it is too long. Unless it is something that I could save and come back to at a later time. 

M: If you were able to save, would that impact how much you’d answer? 

P: Yes, but 10-15 minutes at most.
