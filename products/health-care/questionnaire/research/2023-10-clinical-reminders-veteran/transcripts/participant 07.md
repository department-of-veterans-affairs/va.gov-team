# Participant 7 BHL Heath Questionnaire Veteran Pilot

Notetaker:Peter Russo peter.russo@adhocteam.us

_Start recording._

* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

Yes it is.


## First Task: Notifications - 10 minutes

* Prior to your appointment, did you answer questions online to help your provider prepare for your appointment?

Yes. An email and a text asking about a brief questionnaire in prep for a visit in Oct, and I’m assuming I’ll get another one soon. They had a link to a questionnaire in prep for meeting with PCP

If yes,
* How were you notified, such as a text or email, that your provider wanted you to answer some questions prior to your appointment?
* How far in advance of your appointment did you receive this notification?

Maybe a week? In a window that felt appropriate. There’s a window of 2 weeks to 5 days before that is best, too soon and I’ll put it off, too late and it’s too late. The timeline that it’s been sent to me in the past - it acts as a helpful reminder.

* Do you feel that you were given enough time or not enough time to answer the questions prior to your appointment?

Yes, I was given enough time.

**Nina:** What q’s do you remember?

COVID-like symptoms, if I’m sick, if I need to reschedule, are you taking medication, has anything changed, contact information. For the most part it felt like an all-encompassing health care questionnaire, but also asking if contact info is correct.

**Nina:** Were you given enough time ahead of the appt to answer questions?

I didn't have to write an essay, so I had plenty of time and thought they were the right kind of questions.

* How much time do you estimate it took you to complete the questions after clicking on the [text or email]?
* Share your screen with the example that they mentioned. This is also determine what prototype you share with them.:
    * [eScreening email](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/questionnaire/research/2023-10-clinical-reminders/eScreening%20Email.png)
    * [eScreening text message](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/questionnaire/research/2023-10-clinical-reminders/eScreening-text.jpg)
    * [BHL email](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/questionnaire/research/2023-10-clinical-reminders/BHL%20Email.png)
    * [BHL text message](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/questionnaire/research/2023-10-clinical-reminders/BHL%20Text.png)

**Nina:** shares BHL email example.

* Would you want to receive this notification at a different time prior to your appointment than you did, such as earlier to later? Why?
* Please review the information in this notification and share your overall impressions. Think aloud as you review.
* [Notetaker: Note any observations about the following things: What do they comment on as confusing or valuable without prompting?]
* Was there anything about the notification that is unclear?
* Would you add, delete, or change about the content within the notification?

96 hours seems weird. It’d be better to say days so I don’t have to do the math. “In 3 days” would be clearer. 96 hours is just a strange thing to say.

I think it’s pretty clear and concise. It’s setting up your expectations. Other than the 96 hours. I think saying this personalized link will expire in 4 days or something. 96 hours, you’re asking someone to do math, someone who has health care needs you’re asking them to do another thing.

**Nina:** In 4 days at 10:00 pm would work?

Yes, because you have the time stamp up there, so if you say 4 days from now, that’s pretty self-explanatory.

So this email is a questionnaire in prep for upcoming appointments. Maybe it should say that. Why does my VA provider want to know how I’m doing? Because you have an appointment. Tell me the reason I’m getting the email. Maybe I don’t remember I have an upcoming appointment. This might be an opportunity to remind me.

Other than that it’s good. It says do not reply - maybe that’s another opportunity to remind them how they can get in touch with someone.

I’d expect to get this about a week before my appointment. That’d give me time to check my schedule and make sure I don’t have any conflicts, and give me an opportunity to reschedule if needed.

## Second Task: Complete the clinical reminders - 20 minutes

* Next, pretend that you are answering the pre-appointment questions again. We also call these clinical reminders, so you may hear me refer to them as such. Some of the questions will be familiar to you as you answered them before your appointment, while others may not. Please think a loud as you review the screens. I’ll ask you a few questions as you move though too.
    * [eScreening and BHL links](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/OCTOOCCSelf-ScreeningQuestionnairePilot/Shared%20Documents/General/Pilot%20documents%20(Eval%20plan,%20Project%20Plan,%20etc)/Tool%20Links%20for%20Veteran%20Interviews.docx?d=w50a92e8a483e4bbaaaffc5b4f9717cc6&csf=1&web=1&e=bOG38Q)
* [Notetaker: Note which questionnaire branching logic they follow and if the clinical reminders end in a positive or negative result. Write down any comments shared without prompting from the Moderator.]
* [On each screen] Are there any terms that seem unfamiliar or confusing to you?
* [At the end of each clinical reminder] On a scale from 1 to 5 (with 1 being very easy and 5 being very difficult), how easy or difficult was it to answer these questions about [clinical reminder topic]?
* [At the end of all the clinical reminders]
    * What do you expect to happen next, since you answered these questions?
        * [Skip if they haven't filled out a questionnaire] Does that match what actually happened next at your appointment with your provider knowing that they reviewed your answers? Why or why not?
    * If you could change one thing about this question experience, what would that be?

_Starts on “Welcome! Your provider has some questions for you to complete how you’re doing” page._

Again, this might be an opportunity to say why: that these are regarding an upcoming appointment. It’s a little language to give me insight into why I’m going through this questionnaire.

_Clicks Start. Sexual orientation question_.

**Nina:** Anything confusing?

No, this does a good job of saying the “why” - so I can meet my health care goals. And gives me my options right up front. This is better than the previous page.

**Nina:** Difficulty on 1-5 scale?

Very easy. I’d say 1 to 1.5 It’s a mouthful to read this but it’s easy to understand once you get to the end. It’s probably about right, it’s asking me a question and telling me why the question is being asked. That’s appropriate.

_“In the past 2 months have you been living in stable housing” question._

“Stable” is kind of a subjective question. If I’m coming straight out of the military I’m living in barracks, in between deployments, stable might be a roof over my head. Now that I live in a house with kids, “stable” is default; I’m just operating in my normal behaviors every day. It depends on the person you ask.

What’s a better word than stable? I don’t know. Acceptable, or brings you satisfaction? I don’t know. When I got out of the army what I saw as stable compared to my life now was wildly different.

This is a 3, 3.5 in difficulty. If I’m trying to breeze through I’ll just push whatever [option/button], but if I’m fresh out of the military using VA benefits, “stable” is going to give me pause.

_“Worried or concerned may not have stable housing” question - 6%._

This is a little easier. After reading this I might go back. Maybe I’m not so stable. This is probably the right follow-up question to the last one. Difficulty, between 1-2.

_“Food situation - 12 months worried if your food would run out” question - 21%._

I think this is self-explanatory. It’s asking questions about stability in general, housing and food. I almost wish there was a line where you could add your own language to provide context to your answer. Because you might want your health provider to know about it, like if you recently got a job. 

_“12 months, did food last?” question - 26%._

This question is asking about a longer period, the past year. I think a text box might be helpful here. What if I was going from duty station to duty station in the last 12 months - it might be helpful for the healthcare provider to know if I’m moving a lot. Just because of the long-term nature of the question, now you’re asking about a year. That’s a big timeframe. 

Difficulty is pretty easy, between 1-2

_“DHA Toxic Exposures” question - 34%._

Maybe here you could link out to that law, in case someone wants to learn more about the PACT Act. The items in the possible exposures list is pretty common terminology in our lexicon, I just think the PACT Act is something folks might not be familiar with. Maybe the part where it says “Public Law 117-168” could be a link.

Difficulty is a 2. It’s not the easiest to understand and read, especially if you’re not familiar with it. I deployed to Bosnia, so I don’t know if the PACT Act has any impact on my healthcare. So I might want to learn a little more about how this has bearing on my healthcare. 

If it said “Learn more about PACT act”, the VA has links in their website that have very good information about it. If you’re staying in VA to read more about it, not going to some random website, I think that’d be helpful.

_“Participation in this survey is voluntary” page - 36%._

I’d have to get to the end to understand what this survey is. I didn’t even know I was going to another survey. At the end, based on this email address, I assume it’s about PACT. It looks like there’s a survey but I don’t know what it is.

“Our Office of Management and Budget number…” - this is irrelevant to my personal health care so I’m assuming it has to be there. Other than that it’s pretty easy, probably a 2, 2.5. Just a little confusion at the top.

_Next page - 38%._

I’m assuming I’m starting the survey at this point? Maybe at the top I’d say something about “Question number 1 of this survey.” I don’t know. I’m assuming I went to a new site. Is this a 1 question survey or a 20 question survey? A number of pages might be helpful.

Other than that it’s easy to understand, the language is pretty familiar to the Veteran community. 1-2 difficulty level.

_“Thank you for answering the questions” page - 47%._

It was obviously just a 1 question survey. I didn’t answer “question_s_” I answered 1 question. I think this is easy to understand, self-explanatory, it’s managing my expectations, something will be coming to my text/email in the future. Difficulty 1-2.

_Smoking/tobacco question - 51%._

Dup - I’m assuming that means dip? This is a great question, it really provides clarity on what tobacco is and is not. Right in the good language window, difficulty between 1-2. 

In baseball people always said they had “dip” in their mouth, not “dup”. Other than that it’s all very easy to read.

_“Have you ever used tobacco” question - 53%._

Difficulty of 1. Very easy question. Maybe a text box to add context. “Yes, I tried a cigarette once in high school” But that’s a 1. Maybe just add an opportunity to add context.

_Post-9/11 question - 57%._

Easy question, difficulty of 1. Coming from the Veteran community. I don’t know what the next question is; if I say yes is it going to ask about deployments? What’s next if I say yes? Is a “no” answer going to then ask if I use alcohol? If the answer is yes and I’m not going to put context around it, that’s a lot of info they still need. Being deployed in Afghanistan for 15 months is different than going to Poland and doing paperwork. 1, 1.5 difficulty. It's a yes or no question, but my brain thinks of what’s next.

_Embedded Fragment Screening - 74%._

I’m assuming because I answered no that’s why I’m getting this. If I’d have answered yes, I would have been able to provide details about my deployments.

I think this question is a lot of text, but appropriate for what it’s asking you. I wonder if  this positive response is going to be talked about with my health care team, or is it just going into a registry that I have shrapnel in my leg from a grenade? But this is also very text heavy, so I don’t know if adding more text would be helpful. I think it’s good, maybe a 2 or 3 difficulty. It’s very text heavy and very different from what I was asked before. It’s about an embedded fragment, it’s going to take me 2-3 minutes to complete, that’s good.

The language being used is pretty common in the military and Veteran community.

_“Do you have or suspect that you have retained fragment or shrapnel” question - 77%._

Really good question, pretty self-explanatory. I’d say it’s a 1. It’s giving good examples of why you might have fragments or shrapnel left in your body. Pretty easy to understand.

_Submission page_

Again, it’s a good way to end it, I’m done, I’m complete, I can move on with my day. Some surveys give you the opportunity to go back or review your questions, I don’t know if that’s necessarily appropriate here. That’s how some I completed in the past were done. I might like to have that option. It’s not just asking me about light and breezy stuff, it’s asking things that are more personal. So let me go back and give me a chance to read through and hit submit, that might be a better option.

After I finished this I would hope my PCP was given the answers to these questions, and I would receive, based on the answers, or either way, it’d be nice if my PCP provider, or their team, would call and say I’d like to review your survey submission you completed to see if there’s anything you want to add. I’d expect a follow-up of some kind from my provider. It doesn’t say that in the survey though - it’d be nice to manage expectations at the end, “You’ve submitted it, expect a follow-up in x days”


## Post-Task Interview - 10 minutes

**Nina:** How does this compare to the previous survey?

No, this wasn’t the same survey. When I met with my PCP they asked me about the PACT act stuff. And because I deployed to Bosnia. But some were repeats; tobacco use, sexual orientation. 

* Now, I have just a few more questions for you.
* On a scale from 1 to 5 (with 1 being very easy and 5 being very difficult, how easy or difficult was it to answer these questions?

Overall difficulty is a 2, clarity difficulty is a 3, some parts were jumping all over the place a bit. And that survey, it took a minute to understand that I was taking a survey. I was already in a survey, it felt like a survey within a survey. But once you’re there and in it, it wasn’t hard to understand. It’s more the clarity. Again I think some text boxes would be helpful, some opportunities to provide some insight.

* Would you expect answering these questions online prior to your appointment to impact the quality of your appointment with your provider in any way? If so, how?

Not quality, but the conversations - what we end up talking about. Maybe the length, you might spend more time with your PCP and get some referrals out based on your answers to those questions. If I answered questions in a way to make it look like I was at risk, then I assume my appointment would be a little longer than if I was the healthiest human alive. 

* Would answering the questions on your own time impact your responses compared to answering them with your provider? If so, how?

If that’s sent a week before, rather than a doctor handing me paper at the appointment, my answers would be different. At the appointment I’m just doing it to check off some boxes. If I had some time to breathe I’d be more apt to take it more seriously. The privacy of my own office or home, vs a doctor’s office where other people might be around, they might be seeing what I’m writing. Some of those questions deserve privacy I think.

* Were the number of questions you answered online today:
    * Too many
    * Not enough
    * Just right

Just right. It jumped all over a bit with where I was going, but the amount of questions were fine.

* What would you estimate the ideal number of minutes or question sets to complete at one time prior to one appointment?

If this is leading up to an appointment, maybe a half an hour, that’s fine. But if it’s over an hour…unless I’m putting a lot of context in, anything over a half hour would be too much. 

**Nina:** If you had to change one thing, what would you change?

The survey can do a better job of being two things; clear and concise in the language being used and managing expectations. Answer the why’s - why the questions are being answered. Or why I’m taking the survey - what itn the world is this even about?

* And lastly, do you have any questions for me?
* Okay, great! That is all the questions I have for you today.
