# Participant 5, BHL email and eScreening prototype 

Notetaker: Kristen M.  
[Brackets are notetaker comments/observers] 
 
Moderator (M): Past experience? 

Participant (P): Yes. 

M: Was it through text or email? 

P: I think that I got both. 

M: How far in advance did you get the text? 

P: It was right after that I set up the appointment. It said that you have an appointment and you can pre-register before your appointment. I don’t remember, but I think that it said that I could do it a few days before my appointment. It was around the time that I got the packet of information. 

M: What is in the packet? 

P: It is like the same thing. Pre-appointment questions. Do you have diabetes, eye problems? Anything that they want to know before the appointment. 

M: No questions about toxic exposure of anything that like? 

P: They ask that all the time due to the PACT Act. They asked that recently. 

M: Enough time to complete? 

P: I think that I was given enough time. 

M: Changes to time? 

P: I don’t have a preference. I see benefit to both. If you send it right after I make the appointment, then I can fill it out with everything about why I made the appointment. I see benefit filling it out right before the appointment. I would share what changed. 

M: [Shares notification.] Share overall impression? 

P: My initial is 96 hours. I think that is 4 days or something. I think that is too short of a time. It depends upon what I’m doing. I try to do it immediately, but sometimes…It creates a sense of urgency….most doctors don’t look at everything that you put on there. Is it really important that you fill out everything. They might ask you the same questions again. I think that they keep it as a preemptive appointment. Does the doctor really review this before I get there and follow-up with anything when I get there. I haven’t experienced that. I haven’t had a doctor follow up. If I write that my family has a history of diabetes, he is still going to ask me at my appointment. 

M: Anything unclear? 

P: This is before the appointment correct? It doesn’t say that. I would think that this is a post appointment survey… It doesn’t seem like a fill this out before you get to your appointment… It doesn’t seem like an intake form. 

M: Would you think to fill this out after your appointment? 

P: If I had no knowledge of why they were sending this to me. Say that I don’t check out my email until a week later and it is after my appointment, then I would think that this is the after-appointment survey. I would probably still fill this out. I’m pretty tech and security savvy and I would click on that link, but some Veterans would worry that the link is gathering their information…I like surveys, because I like to give my opinion. I like to complain if it is necessary. I would fill this out, but I think others won’t. They might think what is this for? why didn’t it say that it is a registration form? 

M: Estimated time to complete? 

P: 5-10 minutes. 15 minutes max if they want people to fill this out. 

M: [Shares prototype link.] 

P:  This is not super mobile friendly. I noticed that the words are cut off and I have to scroll the page. It is a pet peeve for me. This page is a little messy. I can tell immediately…I wish that they would say how you would answer the questions. Give a little introduction first, then tell them that the questions expand upon each other. [Moderator sharing story about uncles] They wouldn’t know that these build on each other. They would think that it goes to another page. [Sees the “Save and Exit” button], that is nice that you don’t have to fill it all out right now. 

M: Scale 1-5 questions for homelessness? 

P: You said 5 was difficult? 

M: Yes 

P: Probably a 2. 

M: Any changes? 

P: Introduction and tell them about the save and progress. I know that some surveys that you have to fill it out all at once otherwise the link is used up…I want to know that you can come back or if I would get a new link…If you are having people doing this mobilely, then fix that box. Don’t have anyone scroll over. I don’t know. I question a lot of people’s technological savvy stuff. I think people will have difficultly filling this out. 

M: Continue to review. 

P: Particularly this small wording.  

M: What words are giving you the most trouble? 

P: For accessibility, I have the letters tried up higher. It didn’t accept my accessibility feature. I know to Zoom in, but I like to have the letters bigger on my phone. 

M: Continue to review. 

P: [Reviews food insecurity questions] This is so weird as an option [referring to the switches at the bottom of the page]. Also, I can’t scroll over to see the rest of the ones at the bottom. I do like the brightness, however. I don’t like when they make is a dark background and light words, so I like this. The background does have contrast. It is just weird at the end. I’m not used to switches. It looks like a subscription or a notification. It looks like you are turning on and off notifications. I would have used a box [I think they mean a checkbox] where you can check more than one. 

M: Scale 1 -5? 

P: Still a 2. [Reviews the next page about toxic exposure. Reads about the numbers] Why do I need to know that? What happens if you say Yes? If I notice that it changes what comes next, then I click yes to see what you get if you select yes. 

M: Confusing terms? 

P: What is a registry question? 

M: [Probes about registry.] 

P: We register for a lot of stuff, so what does this mean? Is this for VA benefits or for an appointment. I guess that it means about an appointment. It is vague. 

M: How could we clarify? 

P: What are you registering for? Am I registering for healthcare or for this particular appointment? I might try to message someone to get clarity. [Scrolls and reviews more of the page. Comments on the links at the bottom of the page] Those are nice. [Doesn’t click on them. Goes onto embedded fragments] It is good that they explain what embedded fragments are, because some people might not know what that is. I’m glad that they give examples, because that is a lot of words in that question. Also, retained? I find that is a weird way to explain what is in your body. When I think of retained, I think of water. If you have shrapnel, then it is a part of your body. I don’t think it isn’t accessible though. 

M: What would you say instead? 

P: I would say “Do you have or suspect that you have fragments or shrapnel still inside of you from when you were deployed?” Keep the language super basic. Retained…that is giving SAT. There are so many walks of life in the military. Some are functionality illiterate. Especially, if you are enlisted and not an officer. 

M: Scale 1 – 5? 

 P: 2. [Reads TBI screener and has no comments. Goes onto Tobacco] 

M: Any confusion? 

P: I’m glad that they gave the examples about tobacco. Some people divorce the form of what they are smoking from tobacco. I would add cigarillo and fava leaves. There are more ways to smoke. I would add more. [Reads about electronic cigarettes] Why doesn’t this include e-cigarettes? What about hookah? There are so many ways to smoke now a days. I can’t believe that they don’t include vaping. They are smoking tobacco.  

M: If they say “anything with Nicotine,” would that help? 

P: Yes.  

M: Scale 1 -5? 

P: 1. It is pretty comprehensive, but I just noticed some stuff. [ Goes to next page. Got a notification that they were incomplete and clicked on the link] Oh that is nice that it takes you right to what you missed...It gets you moving to right where you need to be. Sometimes they make you scroll through the entire survey to figure out the mistake. I like that they take you right to the mistake. [Reads the Thank you page] This thank you page is too long. I’m thinking it…like where you need a confirmation or stuff. None of this information is necessary for my next appointment. Reading this…it is nice, but why do I need that. If they have information about more services, then it should be somewhere else. This should be succinct like a newsletter. As soon as I see, here are some more services, then I stop reading. Put the important stuff first and put the other stuff on another page. 

M: What do you think will happen next? 

P: Probably get an email confirming that I completed it. Another appointment confirmation with information on where my appointment is and the doctor that I’m seeing. I expect that it is added to my chart. If my address changed or if I have concerns about my embedded fragments. 

M: Doctor reviewed? 

P: I would be surprised if they do. I think that it will be looked at, but not by the doctor. It might be looked at by the nurse. I’m thinking about the other questions like “Do you have any eye problems?” The doctor is going to look at your chart. He might not look at this form, but he might look at what the person enters into the chart. It is connected, but it isn’t always there. I think that it is important to fill these out as fast as possible, because that is more likely to connect.  

M: Answer prior to appointment? 

P: No…it seems like more connected to a disability appointment, but not a regular appointment. If I don’t have a fragment, then that doesn’t change. I think that you should ask about food every time, but the deployment stuff, then it isn’t connected to my appointment.  

M: Match with what happened at your appointment? Similar to past experience? 

P: Similar. I know what they were getting at, particularly the PACT ACT stuff. They have been really on that. For the rest of it, I’m not sure.  

M: Overall, scale 1-5? 

P: 2 overall. 

M: Answering these question online impact appointment with provider? 

P: Yes. The questions in the beginning should signal a social worker that I might need other resources. The doctor or someone else might reach out and say that you answered the questions in a certain way and we have some resources. The other questions are the same. It can point you in the right directions. I think that it can be very helpful in that respect. 

M: Just right, not enough. 

P: I expected more for a regular appointment about my health. What is your family history? Have you had a survey in the last 6 months? More questions like that. 

M: How many minutes? 

P: With this interface, then I can see it take 15 minutes. If you have diabetes, then you would get more questions. If you say no, then I can move through it quicker. If I don’t have a lot of updates, then I can see you getting through it in 5 minutes. I would say max 15 minutes. 

M: Answering at home vs. doctors? 

P: Yes. I’m rushing through those questions [at the doctor’s office]. I think that you can take your time and really answer at home. 

M: Timing? 

P: Give me at least a week. 7 days.
