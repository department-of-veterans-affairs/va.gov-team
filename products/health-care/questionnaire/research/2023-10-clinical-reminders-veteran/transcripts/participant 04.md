# Participant 4 eScreening Prototype, Didn’t see a text or email 
[Brackets are notetaker comments/observers] 
 
Moderator (M): Prior to your appointment, did you answer questions online? 

Participant (P): I didn’t get them online, but I answered them when I arrived for the appointment. I was asked to come early to fill it out. 

P: The past two visits I did that. It seems kind of new. 

M: What kinds of questions did you answer? 

P: food security, where you live, that kind of thing. 

M: How long? 

P: I would say one or two minutes. I didn’t have any issues. I kind of knew everything. 

M: How was the experience filling out before appointment? 

P: Fine. If it helps the doctor, then yes. If it helps the social worker, then it is good for that too. 

M: Impact to quality of visit? 

P: Because I gave negative answers, the provider might have said that they might deal with the health issues instead. 

M: Timing? 

P: It was ok. I can deal with it either way. If I had issues, then I would like to receive the questionnaire early via mail or text. 

M: [Probes more into timing.] 

P: A few days. They review them pretty quick at the clinic. 

M: [Tries to get more clarity on timing] 

P: Maybe two days, preferably. 

M: Method of receiving questionnaire? 

P: A text link might be good. 

M: [Sends link to Participant. Sent eScreening on an Android mobile device] 

P: [Reads Homeless screening…hesitated that they had to scroll down for next question, but quickly corrected. Quickly, review the options on where they lived and selected other, because I live in my own home.] Would I click “Save and exit. 

M: What do you think that you’d do next? 
 
P: I think that I’d actually click Next. Give it a 1, because that is very easy. 

M: Anything confusing? 

P: I thought that your own house would be listed instead of other. I’ll go back. Navigated back. I would select no government subsidy, which would be more appropriate. I went to fast. 

M: [Has them review food insecurity screener. Might need to go back to video and review] 
 
P: [Reads toxic exposure intro page] Pretty wordy, but the legal department might have gotten a hold of this. I wasn’t exposed to any Agent Orange. But I worked in a shop, so was I exposed to anything? I answered no. I’d give it a 2, because I had to think about it a little bit. 
 
M: Why a 2? 
 
P: I had to consider all of these situations. I had to quickly think through all of my service history. The question was clear, but I had to think about it to answer it. 
 
M: Make it better to comprehend? 
 
P: Maybe all that legalize was a lot. Maybe ask the question first and put the legalize after. It was clear, but it was verbose. The preface information was distracting, but I understand that you need to have it. If it is second, then it makes me think about the question and not the legalize to prepare for the question. 
 
P: [Reads embedded fragment screener]. That is really clear. It does have the preface information, but it is really clear.  
 
M: Scale 1 -5? 
 
P: 1. 
 
P: [Reads TBI Screener] Very clear. Not confusing. I’d give it a 1. [Reads tobacco screener] That was clear and easy. I’d give it a 1. 
 
M: What do you expect to happen next now? 
 
P: I have no idea. No clue. 
 
M: Click the next button.  
 
P: Oh, finish, so we are at the finish line. I’d give that a 1. Should I read the thank you screen? 
 
M: Yes.  
 
P: That was good. It tells me what I finished doing and what to expect if I needed help in those areas. 
 
M: What would you expect after filling this out? 

 

P: It would go into my electronic health record, then before my next appointment that they would  

M: What actually happened? 

P: I did it in the waiting room and I brought it in with me. The intake nurse went over it with me. Since there was nothing wrong in the answer, she confirmed that I answered the questions accurately. 
 
M: Overall scale 1 to 5? 

P: 1. Very easy to answer. It was pretty clear. 
 
M: Answering on own time compared to answering them with provider or in waiting room? 

P: Considering my current situation, no, but if I was more complicated, then I would want to take more time and think about how I was to interact with my provider. 

M: Time? 

P: The time to fill it out would be the same, but I would want to think about how the information would be received. 

M: Number of questions? 

P: Just right. 
 
M: Ideal minutes or questions? 

P: If they are easy like these, then 10-20 questions would be fine. I’d say 20 would be good. Whatever would get a good picture of the patient. I would do whatever. Based upon the questions, you could probably drill down more with the patient. 

M: Anything missing? 

P: No. 

M: Anything else? 

P: Drug abuse. Illegal drugs like meth, fentanyl. I would want to have that and be sure of that. From a social standpoint, I was to know if they had any convictions. Something beyond a misdemeanor. It is pretty invasive. If I had a recent conviction, then I might be offended. If you had a meeting with a social worker, then this information might be helpful.
