# Participant 12 eScreening Heath Questionnaire Veteran Pilot

Notetaker: Jamine Yohannan

Q1: Remembered receiving a couple different questions, one of them says Yes, and then if he answers No to that one, he will receive an email asking for the schedule. And then also the covid one.

Q2 : Notified through text, and letters. I get some emails but usually because I go to the text. Sometimes on emails I get notified that i have an MHV message to check. 

Q3: Maybe 3 days out at most I get notifications, usually its 2. Sometimes I get a message when I go to Community Care I'll get a message 15 mins ahead of time saying your appt is in 15 mins to check-in. 

Q4: I was given enough time to answer these questions, maybe because I filled them out quickly. Doesn't seem to time-out.

2-3 days is good for ahead of time. Because as soon as my appointment is verified I put it on my calendar. 

Sometimes the timing of receiving physical  letters for notifications have a mix-up 

Reaction to email:

- electronic questionairre will not be reviewed immediately - it goes to a bank somewhere and someone just looks at it when its ready to be reviewed 

 Doesn't know how many questions are on that questionairre yet 

Reaction to questionairre:

- Did not realize that they had to scroll
- Information is a 1 difficulty level (aka very easy)

Demographics & Social Information 
first screen 
- I can hit the Save & exit and go back to it 
- the only time I've used save & exit is when there are long kindof questions
- I know that if I go to a VA appointment some of their pre-appointment invovles safety, so I'm unfamiliar with this particular screen but I understand why it would be part of the process. So even though I've never seen it, I would fill it out and hit next
- This would be a 1 (relatively 1)
- I'm assuming there will be more questions about this 
food
- you can change the gramma of the first question r to change it to "were you worried"
-1(relatively easy)

Service History 
- On this page right now, no confusing questions, anything missing? 
- I can imagine some other Veterans migth want to see more detail under Other exposures 
- there are Veterans who have never applied they are not aware of what they should be looking for. I don't know how you can't be aware, I might be more still with it.
- I am assuming not everybody understands presumptive conditions, but pretty clear to me 

- for me a 1, maybe for other veterans a 2

embedded fragment
- 1


-1
health habits
- 1

thank you
-2 - it's pretty wordy, i can get a copy of my qeustions/answers 
-changed to 1 after thinking about the text 

What do you think happens next?

- maybe depending on the answers if I need more information, maybe it triggers something at the VA that would give me info separate from my appointment 

- Because any Veterans don't even know they can qualify for, this questionairre maybe helpful for them 

if i can change anything:
- would love for more Veterans to be able to know about this
- Yes I would expect it to impact my appointment if this goes to my VA provider 
- unclear on where it goes but thinks it will go to my VA provider, would not expect a lot to happen because all of my VA providers are familiar with my situation
- If I have an appointment with community care they would not get this info 

- not too many questions, just right

- 5 minutes should be maximum for the survey 

- my answer questions would not be different if I were in person with my doctor, they would be the same

- no questions, one thing that is concerns me, when I go to an outside community care doctor, they can't get VA material, now they are having less issues with that, several years ago I know from the questions I answered for VA the doctor wouldn't know that I needed certain tests. In the last 5 years that hasn't really been an issue 
- only the specialists take a long time
