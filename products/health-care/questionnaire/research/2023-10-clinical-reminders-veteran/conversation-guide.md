## Intro - 5 minutes 

  

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Kristen] and we have our notetaker on for taking notes. 

I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...  

  

Today we're going to talk about an experience receiving a text or email, then answering health questions online. These questions can help your primary care provider prepare for your medical appointment. 

  

Before we start, a few things I want to mention: 

  

- **This entire session should take about [an hour].** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic. 

- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. 

- **You'll be interacting with a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may look and function like the live site but since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA healthcare.

- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**  

- Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I want to be sure before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?** 

   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom. 

   - If yes: Admit observers.  

    - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant) 

   - Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth 

- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete the analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this) or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7. Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Second Task: Complete the clinical reminders - 20 minutes 

- Next, pretend that you are answering the pre-appointment questions again. We also call these clinical reminders, so you may hear me refer to them as such. Some of the questions will be familiar to you as you answered them before your appointment, while others may not. Please think a loud as you review the screens. I’ll ask you a few questions as you move though too.

- [**Notetaker:** Note which questionnaire branching logic they follow and if the clinical reminders end in a positive or negative result. Write down any comments shared without prompting from the Moderator.] 

- [On each screen] Are there any terms that seem unfamiliar or confusing to you? 

- [At the end of each clinical reminder] On a scale from 1 to 5 (with 1 being very easy and 5 being very difficult), how easy or difficult was it to answer these questions about [clinical reminder topic]? 

- [At the end of all the clinical reminders] 

  - What do you expect to happen next, since you answered these questions? 

    - [Skip if they haven't filled out a questionnaire] Does that match what actually happened next at your appointment with your provider knowing that they reviewed your answers? Why or why not? 

  - If you could change one thing about this question experience, what would that be?

## Thank-You and Closing - 3 minutes 

  

Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on these experiences and make sure it really works for Veterans. 

Before you go, I wanted to iterate that everything we did today wasn’t real. The questions that you answered were not submitted to your provider or anywhere.  

Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies. 

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day! 

  

## Emergency Exit 

  

- Out of questions: We have covered all the questions I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback. 

- Blame technology: I am so sorry, but I just learned that the thing I wanted to test with you today is unexpectedly not working. I apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your time.
