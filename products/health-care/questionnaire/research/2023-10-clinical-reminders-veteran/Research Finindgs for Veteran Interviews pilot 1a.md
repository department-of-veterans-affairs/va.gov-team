# Research Findings for Health Questionnaire, Clinical Reminders Veteran Interviews pilot 1a, November 2023
The volume of clinical reminders has been impacting the quality of the time the patient spends with the provider. Providers have also reported increased burden due to data entry and notification fatigue. Therefore, Veteran Health Administration (VHA) is in search of a tool that allows customizable and standardized health forms, screeners, and questionnaires to be sent to the patient to collect responses asynchronously. Through an earlier evaluation, it was identified that VA already has two digital questionnaire tools within our ecosystem, Behavioral Health Labs (BHL) and eScreening, that can meet many, but not all our process and technological needs. OCC, OCTO, and VHA program offices agreed to complete a pilot to gather more insight to compare the tools. This study will collect Veteran feedback on the tools.

## How this research maps to the Veteran journey
- Taking care of myself
- Putting down roots
- Retiring
- Aging
   <br> 
 <br>

## Research goals
The goal of this researh is to discover the following:
-  Would Veterans change anything about the timing of when they receive the questionnaire notification/link?
-  Did Veterans feel that they were given enough time to complete the questionnaires prior to their appointment?
-  How easy was the tool to utilize?
-  How much time do Veterans estimate it took them to complete the questionnaires?
-  How easy are the questions to understand?
-  Did answering these questionnaires impact the quality of their appointment with their provider in any way?
-  Did answering these questions online from anywhere impact Veterans’ responses compared to answering these questions with their provider? How?
-  What is Veteran’s preference for the number of clinical screeners to complete at one time via these experiences?
   <br> 
 <br>
 
## Hypothesis
-  Veterans will identify areas to improve the ease of use within the tool.
-  The questions within each clinical reminder will be understandable.
-  Answering the questionnaires will allow help to optimize the Veteran’s time with their care provider.

## Key findings

**Finding 1:** Most Veterans do not differentiate between the many pre-visit products/questionnaires currently available.

-  Past Experience with pre-visit questionnaires
    - Pre-visit-summary: Unclear
    - Pre-check-in: 6
    - Clinical reminders: Unclear
      
-  Modality
     - Online with notification: 4
     - Phone call: 2
     - Waiting room: 2
     - PCP in room: 1
       
**Recommendation:** Combine the pre-visit-summary, clinical reminders, and pre-check-in into one digital experience for the Veteran to complete before their appointment.
  <br> 
 <br>

**Finding 2:** 14 out of 15 participants found their past experience answering pre-appointment questions to be adequate; they spoke about the time required to answer questions, the timeframe the notification was received, and the notification modality.

> P14: *"I did feel pressured when I was given them (questionnaires) on a clipboard, so when you get them in advance, at least you have a chance to give it a little more thought."*

> P7: *"I would say… a week before my appointment...And that's just to give [me] more flexibility…And also it gives me time to think."*

> P10: *"Sometimes it's easy to lose a text message; but…if it's in your email, it's there.”*

**Recommendation:** Send Veterans their first pre-appointment questionnaire notification 5-7 days prior to their appointment. Ask Veterans for their questionnaire notification preference (email, text, etc.) and utilize the preference when sending the questionnaires.
  <br> 
 <br>

**Finding 3:** Over 7 out of 15 participants found at least one screener to not apply to their appointment. Many thought the VA had the information on file, thus making the questions redundant and a waste of their time.
 
> P6: *"You might be trying to lump too much together, because if it's I don't know like I go round and round in my mind, because if this is prior to a medical appointment then benefits or claims questions wouldn't really be dealt with at the medical appointment enrollment. If I'm already going for an appointment, then I'm already enrolled."*

> P8: *"The toxic exposure questions should be asked to Veterans specifically that those questions pertain to…For anyone that hasn’t been injured by a blast, this is a redundant question. It doesn’t apply to every Veteran. This should be a personalized question.“*

> P10: *"If I’m doing my annual physical and I’ve been out of the army for 5 years, then I’ve already answered this. Why are you asking me again?"*

> P15: *"They're not relevant to my appointment with my doctor... the doctor does not deal with benefits."*

**Recommendation:** Take Veteran feedback into account when determining the frequency that the reminders are sent; or inform Veterans that this is a general screening that captures information on all Veterans, who maybe at risk for certain conditions, even if certain questions do not pertain to their healthcare appointment.
  <br> 
 <br>
 
**Finding 4:** Some participants didn’t understand why they would get VA healthcare enrollment and eligibility questions, since they were already enrolled. In addition, they were confused on how benefits/claims questions were going to be addressed in their healthcare appointment.

> P10: *"I wonder why it is telling me to call the Veterans Benefits Administration when this is for an appointment. It makes me question the system. Is this truly a pre-appointment thing, or is it taking me down another path?”*  eScreening

> P1: *"How is ‘ Benefits and claims’ different from ‘Enrollment and eligibility’ in this context?“…Is registry different? What does it mean?”* BHL

**Recommendation:** This question needs to be reevaluated to make sense to the Veteran or it should be removed.
       <br> 
 <br>

**Finding 5:** 5 out of 15 expressed the TES list isn't comprehensive, because it excludes many tours of duty and doesn’t explicitly name all possible toxic exposures.

> P7: *"It's not the easiest thing to understand and read, especially if you're unfamiliar with it…I deployed to Bosnia, and so I don't know if the PACT Act has any bearing on my healthcare…I would be interested to know…maybe I was exposed to something. So, I think, for someone like me, who didn't go to Iraq or Afghanistan but did deploy somewhere. For someone like [me, I] might want to learn a little bit more about this."*BHL

> P2: *"I guess my problem with this is. I think it needs to differentiate between Vietnam, Korean, Gulf War, Iraq, and Afghanistan. That's because all of our experiences are going to be different. They're trying to lump everybody's experience into one question which to me doesn't make a lot of sense.”[Responses might be different] if they think it only relates to Camp Lejeune."* Vietnam Veteran eScreening

**Recommendation:** Reevaluate how to ease Veterans understanding of what could qualify as “other exposures“ and inform them on why not all enlistments are included.
  <br> 
 <br>

**Finding 6:** 7 out of 15 Veterans did not know what “registry” meant.

> P14: *"Well, I'm in the system. So, I wouldn't click on that registry. I don't know what that means. ‘Registry’ for what?”* eScreening

> P3: *"The only things that I would question is 'Registry questions.'” I don’t know what that means. Does that mean something related to benefits? If it means how to register, then…I don’t know what it means. I would like more clarification on that section.”* eScreening

> P9: *“I don’t know what registry questions are. It is the first time that I’ve seen registry questions."* BHL

**Recommendation:** Evaluate how to provide more context for “registry."
 <br> 
 <br>
 
**Finding 7:** In both tools, the thank you message content made some Veterans concerned that their care team may not review responses in time for their appointment. Wording in eScreening Interface: “You may ask to meet with your provider to discuss any issues presented in this screen. You can also call the VA team at any point in the future for assistance. Their contact information is listed on your personalized summary.” 

> P10: *“…I thought that I was filling this out because I have an appointment…This wording makes me question, because I’m already meeting with my provider. If I click on this, then shouldn’t they already be ready to meet about it. I’d like to check off what I’d like to talk to them about.”* [Wants the list on this last page to be a checklist that they can let the provider know more about what they want to talk about]. eScreening

Wording in BHL Interface: “Your responses are not reviewed in real time You are encouraged to discuss your responses with your care team.”

> "P15: *I would hope by the time I got my care team they already have them; that worries me. Why did I go through this the last 7 minutes? And my care team may not have this because this is given to me prior to my appointment? So that right there sends a little alarm to me the way it's worded.”*BHL

**Recommendation:** Reevaluate the terminology used to reassure users that their care teams will address their responses during their healthcare appointment.
 <br> 
 <br>

**Finding 8:** 6 out 15 found the questionnaire was "just the right amount" in length. 5 out of 15 Veterans were frustrated with the length mostly due to not seeing the questions as relevant to their appointment. Most stated the questionnaire should be kept to 10 minutes in length. 

> P9: *"It depends. In this scenario, I’m taking it before I go to a new clinic or provider. I would say no more than 5 to 10 minutes."*

> P8: *"There wasn’t too many. It was just questions that needed to be answered. If there were more questions that needed to be answered, then I would answer them."*

**Recommendation:** Keep the survey to 10-15 minutes to avoid frustrations or questionnaire abandonment.
 <br> 
 <br>
 
**Finding 9:** Overall, no usability issues were observed with the BHL tool. In eScreening, 2 out of 7 people initially thought the “Save and Exit” button is how you continued to the next page. 1 participant had extreme difficulty utilizing the eScreening mobile UI.

> P10: *"Do you want me to hit 'Save and exit”?'"* (he believed that to move to next screen you have to save this screen and exit.)

> P5 (Assistive Tech User): *"Tell them that you can save and exit...So you know they know that they don't have to fill it out all at once."*

> P5 (Assistive Tech User): *"Immediately, this is like not super mobile friendly… I noticed that the words were cut off, and I had to scroll in the box instead of on the page…for my screen,…for accessibility,…I have the letters turned up really high. So, naturally, everything is bigger for me, and these are way smaller than what is on my screen. So, it didn't even adapt to the accessibility feature on my phone."*

**Recommendation:** Prioritize design work to explore UI or content solutions to address the eScreening concerns.
 <br> 
 <br>

## Secondary Findings

**Secondary Findings 1:** 5 out of 15 participants mentioned they would like to either review or print out a summary of their responses, so they can share with them their non-VA providers.

> P2: *"I probably would ask for a printout what of what my responses are, simply because I have what they call dual coverage with the VA. And private health insurance...I see some doctors outside of the VA.” *eScreening

> P1: *"It would be nice to see the answers I had flagged, like a summary report, or answers that you may follow up with. I would like a copy of these answers in my file that I answered these questions."* BHL 
 
**Recommendation:** Investigate additional ways for Veterans to receive a summary of their responses.
 <br> 
 <br>
 
**Secondary Findings 2:** 4 out of 15 participants mentioned they’d like see their provider’s information listed in the notification and “Welcome" screen, not only for security reasons, but also, to help them identify which of their many appointments the questionnaire pertains to.

> P5: *"I have cyber security awareness…I would know that this is probably really coming from the VA just based on everything that's on here...But if somebody’s… [is] not as tech savvy… they can't like tell us that's something legit or not...They might not immediately click on that link. They might just ignore it completely. I would know it's legit, but at the same time…I still would hesitate to just click on and filling my personal information.”*

> P1: *"I would like to know which provider this is for; Sometimes I see 2 providers per week.”*

**Recommendation:** Explore opt-in capabilities that VeText has for appointment reminders to show an additional data point in SMS message. Revisit the content displayed on the Welcome screen.
 <br> 
 <br>

**Secondary Findings 3:** Some participants, 3 out of 15, would like both the notification, and the questionnaire, to contain information on the length of the questionnaire and whether it can be resumed once started.

> P9: *"Having a busy schedule…I need to answer these questions. [It would be helpful to know] it's going to take…X amount of time. I could plan a little bit better.”*

> P5: *“Talk about the ‘save and exit’ at the bottom…tell people…if you start this at any time… you don't necessarily have to finish it [in one sitting]. Cause I know filling out some surveys…you have to do it all at once. I want to know that before I started, because sometimes you can't do it again or [if] the link expires.”*

**Recommendation:** In the notification, include the estimated time to take the questionnaire and whether link can be reused once the link has been clicked on.
 <br> 
 <br>

**Secondary Findings 4:** 2 out of 8 BHL participants found the sexual orientation to be very sensitive information that should only be shared with their healthcare providers.

> P13: *"Very sensitive...I would like a disclaimer saying this information will only be shared with your provider."*

**Recommendation:** Explore adding a disclaimer with the question stating that sexual orientation info will only be shared with healthcare team.
 <br> 
 <br>

**Secondary Findings 5:** 2 out of 8 BHL participants believed the sexual orientation questions were irrelevant to their healthcare appointment. One participant believed that gender identity was part of sexual orientation, and they did not differentiate between the two.

> P8: *"I don’t know what the purpose of this question is...I’m not sure what their sexual orientation has to do with their preventative care."*

> P6: *“What a shame has the country come to this that this is a question for a medical appointment?... When I signed up to for the VA, it was obvious that I was a male. I don’t know why I need to keep answering these questions.”*

**Recommendation:** Explore adding a brief disclaimer as to why sexual orientation questions are relevant within this context.
 <br> 
 <br>
 
**Secondary Findings 6:** 2 out 15 participants believe the word "stable" is subjective and can mean different things for different people.

> P7: *"'Stable' is kind of a subjective question. If I’m coming straight out of the military, I’m living in barracks, in between deployments, stable might be a roof over my head. Now that I live in a house with kids, 'stable' is default; I’m just operating in my normal behaviors every day. It depends on the person you ask...When I got out of the army what I saw as stable compared to my life now was wildly different."*

**Recommendation:** Explore content changes to provide more clarity on what stable means.
 <br> 
 <br>
 
**Secondary Findings 7:** 2 out of 15 Veterans mentioned that not all forms of smoking are listed, such as hookah, and vaping, etc.., but should be included.

> P5: *“[This does] not include electronic cigarettes, vaping devices, really? Wow…why doesn't it include electronic cigarettes?...why didn't they ask [about] hookah…? People smoke hookah. There's so many ways to smoke nowadays. And I can't believe they're not including vaping.”* eScreening

> P15: *“Why not include these [speaking to the text about vaping, etc.]. It almost makes the Veteran say that these don’t affect my health, but there are studies out there that they do.”* BHL

**Recommendation:** Look into why vaping, hookah, and other forms of smoking are not mentioned in the questionnaire.
 <br> 
 <br>
**Secondary Findings 8:** 4 out of 8 BHL users mentioned that "Dip" is misspelled as "Dup".

**Recommendation:** Correct BHL's "dup" spelling.
 <br> 
 <br>
 
**Secondary Findings 9:** The “Post 9/11 injuries” screen does not have an option to choose other injuries that may be relevant to Post 9/11.

> One participant reluctantly chose *“I did not experience any of these events,"* however, they felt that they was forced to choose an incorrect response because they had no other option:

> P11: *"I did not experience any of these events. I was looking for option to just say ‘any events,' but it said 'other injury to the head,' so I didn't have any head injuries, but I did get other injuries...it didn't expand outside of that, whereas I needed to expand. Beyond these answers given."*

**Recommendation:** Evaluate whether to add an "other injuries" option, or a text box so Veterans can provide more context for their injures.
 <br> 
 <br>

**Secondary Findings 10:** Many participants believe that answering the questionnaire a few days before their appointment would have an impact on the responses. (They were speculating about their future behavior and not reflecting on past behavior.)

> P5: *"I’m rushing through those questions [at the doctor’s office]. I think that you can take your time and really answer at home.”*

> P1: *“Answering them on my own time, I might be more honest about the severity or depth of what I'm going through; If I answered these questions, I would get push back, ‘You look fine... its really not bad’. I would probably downplay my symptoms, because I don't think they will take me seriously."*

**Recommendation:** Send the clinical reminders before the appointment so that Veterans can have ample time to reflect on the questions, formulate genuine, and more accurate responses.
