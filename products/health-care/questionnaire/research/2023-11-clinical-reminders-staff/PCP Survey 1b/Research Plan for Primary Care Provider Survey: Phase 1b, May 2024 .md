# Research Plan for Health Questionnaire, Clinical Reminders Pilot – Primary Care Provider Survey: Phase 1b, April 2024 

 [Research Repo Ticket #520](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/520)

“The Clinical Reminder system helps caregivers deliver higher quality care to patients for both preventive health care and management of chronic conditions, and helps ensure that timely clinical interventions are initiated. 

 

Reminders assist clinical decision-making and also improve documentation and follow-up, by allowing providers to easily view dates when certain tests or evaluations were performed and to track and document when care has been delivered. They can direct providers to perform certain tests or other evaluations that will enhance the quality of care for specific conditions. The clinicians can then respond to the reminders by placing relevant orders or recording clinical activities on patients’ progress notes. 

 

Clinical Reminders may be used for both clinical and administrative purposes.”

The volume of clinical reminders has been impacting the quality of the time the patient spends with the provider. Providers have also reported increased burden due to data entry and notification fatigue. Therefore, Veteran Health Administration (VHA) is in search of a tool that allows customizable and standardized health forms, screeners, and questionnaires to be sent to the patient to collect responses asynchronously. Through an earlier evaluation, it was identified that VA already has two digital questionnaire tools within our ecosystem, Behavioral Health Labs (BHL) and eScreening, that can meet many, but not all our process and technological needs. OCC, OCTO, and VHA program offices agreed to complete a pilot to gather more insight to compare the tools.  

 

## Research Goals	 

This study will collect data using a survey questionnaire that will be emailed to a VA primary care physician whether the clinical reminders health questionnaire pilot yielded noticeable improvements to the following: 

Improved the quality of the time providers spent with  patients during the appointment. 

- Reduced notification fatigue.  

- Reduced provider burnout. 

- Maintains an appropriate level of safety and clinical integrity?  

 

### Hypothesis 

- The tool will reduce overall clinical reminder burden for providers, including data entry and notification fatigue.  

- Providers will perceive digital questionnaires to be a safe way to gather this information from Veterans.  

 

## Methodology	 

Multiple choice survey emailed to all primary care providers who participated in the Health Questionnaire: Clinical Reminders pilot.
