0:0:5.850 --> 0:0:18.70

Moderator:
So I just like to confirm that you used the BHL in the first phase and then you switched over to the E screening in the second phase, is that yeah.
0:0:16.850 --> 0:0:22.610

Participant 5:
I I honestly though didn't have much with the HL, I just didn't.
I think there was a there was a delay of getting me access and then by the time I had access.
I used.
I had was just figuring out the elearning.
So, or the E screening. So I didn't.
Never really use HL to be honest.
0:0:43.30 --> 0:0:49.280

Moderator:
So and  I think you used mostly power BI with when you did use the BHL.
Is that correct?
0:0:50.280 --> 0:0:51.280

Participant 5:
Yeah, absolutely.
0:0:51.950 --> 0:0:56.980

Moderator:
So can you just just for the record, can you just tell me how you were involved with the pilot?
0:0:58.340 --> 0:1:9.980

Participant 5:
I was the Minneapolis Rep that was doing the toxic exposure navigator the roles of the toxic exposure screening reminder.That's the only one that I do that I deal with.
0:1:15.750 --> 0:1:23.300

Moderator:
So can you tell me how your experience with the E screening tool and were you trained on that at all?
0:1:24.490 --> 0:1:26.820

Participant 5:
The training opportunity was provided for me.
Umm, but I was not able to make that call.
We were meeting weekly Thursdays, 11:30 and the the one Thursday that they had the training.
I wasn't able to be there, so I had the other (Redacted PII) who goes by Jack.
I can't remember his name right now.
He's a social worker.
I believe he called me and he walked me through with how to pull reports.
The parts that I missed and things like that so I could use it better and but before before talking to Jack, I couldn't figure out a polar report.
0:2:1.580 --> 0:2:11.170

Moderator:
Can you talk to me about your process, about how to pull the reports in with the East screening and do and all the processes and steps involved?
0:2:12.740 --> 0:2:19.910

Participant 5:
Well, I I don't have it by memory like I do the umm power BI.
I can do that.
My eyes closed, but I'd have to.
I I'd have to like go through it and tell you where, where I click.I wouldn't be able to.
That one.
0:2:28.910 --> 0:2:33.0

Moderator:
No,  just generally you don't have to be very specific.
0:2:33.410 --> 0:2:37.530

Participant 5:
No, I just go to the pool reports and then you've gotta.
Ohh gosh.
Been like 2 weeks since I did.
Oh yes, please do so.
Can I just look at it because I want to be able to use some proper lingo.
That's my pen.
No, OK there.
It must have hit the wrong button.
Oh yeah, so.
Had to go to.
Export data, yeah, export data.
I think what I was doing wrong was the clinics.
I had too many clinics.
I put all and I had to just put one per time on export data.
And then the export deidentified data.
I think that's how I did it.
0:3:47.430 --> 0:3:53.780

Participant 5:
With the with the month of the month I I only did April month away in the month of March.
I pulled the month of March and there were never very many toxic exposure E screenings done.
It was only the month of March.
I think it was like 9 E screens.
I'm going off memory.
I sent the.
I sent that to (Redacted PII).
There are nine TS screenings down through the screening and like 4 required follow up and they were all four of them were done by the provider.
0:4:21.110 --> 0:4:22.410

Participant 5:
That's what he wanted me to track.
0:4:25.640 --> 0:4:28.430

Moderator:
Could you tell me, have you heard any feedback? Umm, about the toxic exposure screening from providers or other VA staff?
0:4:38.750 --> 0:4:41.250

Participant 5:
I mean, I do the thing that's tricky.
I might be like.
I'm a toxic exposure screening navigator to so I think I'm more involved than most people at this, so I might be I might give too much feedback and I'm not sure.
Umm, a lot of, I think the biggest thing right now VA wide for us is that the screening people like veterans don't know they had a screening.
0:5:6.520 --> 0:5:10.810

Participant 5:
They say they say things like they call the EH clinic here and they go.
I'm calling to see the results of my toxic exposure screening.
Umm and like, well, you.
Yeah, you did your exposures.
You did your TS screening at your primary care appointment.
You know the LPN did it.
And then if you said you had any health concerns or needed any registry information, then that tags the doctor or the provider and then they discussed that with you at their primary at that same visit, was supposed to be the same visit, not not out all the primary cares are doing it on the same visit.
Those are the ones that I finish, but then they the the veteran doesn't really know they did it.
They don't.
They don't know it's complete.
0:5:52.200 --> 0:5:58.220

Participant 5:
They don't really know what it is and I don't know if that's on the veteran or the primary care providers.
To me it seems like the primary care might not even know what they're asking in the reminder, and then I because I had a TS console created.
0:6:7.220 --> 0:6:26.370

Participant 5:
So if primary cares didn't know how to answer a question in regards to the veterans exposure, it flagged me so I could call them because I, as I told (Redacted PII) at the beginning until I started to figure this all out, it's like I don't think the right amount of information is getting to the right people.
0:6:27.890 --> 0:6:35.690

Participant 5:
In in this toxic exposure, navigate or screening reminder, umm, it either just gets closed out or it went to it. It went nowhere. And so that console was created.
That's kind of a standard nationwide now for.
And in Minneapolis did not have it. I had to like pull teeth to give it to get it to be in there.
So now I'm getting more positive.
TES screens, so the ones who actually did have an exposure and no compensation for it.
Don't know how to get a VSO.
I'm actually getting those people from that console button, not from any sort of east screening or power BI.
Either one, I think that console has been the most effective thing on getting positives to me now.
I would say 20 to 30% of those didn't.
I didn't need to have a console placed for.
For me, they just.
I didn't know what to do and they just saw, you know, a button.
And they said, oh, this looks fine to you, has console.
I'll do it and it's in.
And then the veterans.
Confused cause I think they're getting another screen or they had a positive, you know to whatever positive exposure means to them, which as a veteran you could imagine uh, it sound, it doesn't sound pretty.
So they don't know what we did.
Do you know what I mean?
0:7:51.20 --> 0:8:2.980

Moderator:
And so do you feel like the the nurses as well has have the same experience as the primary cares, like in terms of not knowing what questions they're asking? Is that happening with the nurses too?
0:8:4.160 --> 0:8:8.940

Participant 5:
Yes, but I I can imagine because I've been in healthcare for 20 years.
So I'm and that is, I don't work over in primary care.
I do have an LPN that I work with now who did work in primary care and her and I have discussed that she does believe it's probably starts with the LPN not knowing what they're asking.
0:8:22.710 --> 0:8:30.760

Participant 5:
Umm, you know, like I'll get a positive Camp Lejeune water exposure and then I get the consult sent to me and the kids. 22.
So they don't even know the dates of the water exposure, but he was stationed at Camp Lejeune.
And then thinks that since he was there in 2019 that he had exposure to contaminated water, but the, you know, so it probably could have just been stopped right there.
If the LPN had like something in front of her that said if you were in at station at Camp Lejeune from 54 to 86, I think it is or 64 to 86.
Yes.
And then it would have just been like no health concerns related to like I got a console today for a liver cancer, an 84 year old with liver cancer with asbestosis.
With significant asbestos exposure, well asbestos exposure, presumptive to asbestos exposure is not liver cancer.
0:9:20.450 --> 0:9:22.500

Participant 5:
So and the PCP sent that to me.
0:9:23.240 --> 0:9:26.550

Participant 5:
Uh, now, of course I have to follow up because the guys probably like.
Oh, should I should have been getting some sort of service connected disability, or at least call my VBA.
Or I mean and it's not my job to I have to be very careful because when I say can't be legal, I can't make recommendations and that's where I'm saying I might be saying too much.
As the navigator and the CMP provider, I can't.
I can't say ohh I have to say well, just because it's not on the presumptives if you believe it's, you know connected to your you know exposures you've had in the military, you should contact your VSO.
I have to be very careful with what I say, so some of those conversations wouldn't have to happen if they were stopped at that level.
You know the LPN and primary variable.
0:10:5.290 --> 0:10:11.200

Moderator:
So actually the questions really should be have to be rewritten, right?
0:10:11.530 --> 0:10:11.770

Participant 5:
So you think so in like maybe add the dates to the questions instead of just asking, were you at Camp Lejeune?
0:10:18.410 --> 0:10:19.50

Moderator:
So is. Is that what you're essentially saying?
0:10:20.160 --> 0:10:37.70

Participant 5:
Yeah, you know, cause it does do that like and then I got, you know, I get some silly ones that I'm not silly cause the veteran's concerned, but then the the, the, the PCP just goes toxic exposure console and then the reason is for fumes.
I mean, I I've been practicing for 20 years and I've been in many consults.
And if I've put a consult in something like that, like that specialty provider calls me and is like, what is this? That's not how you put in. Consults.
I I don't know.
Please be details.
0:10:54.120 --> 0:11:3.900

Moderator:
OK, so (Redacted PII)so what's the difference between, UM, BHL in in screening in terms of all these issues? Because I did watch your initial interview with Redacted PII.
0:11:9.980 --> 0:11:10.160

Participant 5:
Yeah.
0:11:10.450 --> 0:11:19.170

Moderator:
You have you noticed a difference or are you getting the same types of, uh, errors between people?
Uh, I cause I know you mentioned, you know, you'd like to educate the providers and the the LPN's more, but do you find like they're they're making the same errors as they did with PHL with the E screening where they like pretty consistent or did you notice a difference between the two screeners?
0:11:44.470 --> 0:11:52.120

Participant 5:
I would say it's probably pretty consistent, hard to hard to track that because there's so fewer E screenings for TS. So I mean, it's kind of hard to give. I mean, you're you're this, you know this.
0:11:59.410 --> 0:11:59.730

Moderator:
Right.
0:11:56.830 --> 0:12:0.810
Participant 5:
It's kind of hard to give correct data or accurate data when you only have 9 of them.
0
Uh and power BI.
I feel like it's just easier to find.
I pulling the reports off E screening.
I was just like, of course, once you.
You know, do something enough, it just becomes muscle memory.
So it could be a little, you know, skewed because of that.
I'm just more comfortable with the power BI reports and the power.
I'd be BI reports are only telling me so.
Yeah. So a backpedal on that? A little bit. They're only telling me what provider didn't follow up. Umm, didn't. Not even follow up. I should say didn't close the reminder.
That's all I know from that, so I have to go looking for that eye screening.
Told me what it was. They were. What the exposure was, what the questions they had so had I figured out East screening better.  I probably would have liked these screening tool reports better, because then I could see what the veteran actually said.
0:13:6.60 --> 0:13:9.70

Moderator:
(Redacted PII) actually has a follow up question for you. I believe it's a follow up, I'm sorry.
0:13:12.640 --> 0:13:14.720

Observer 1
It it's tangentially related. So, so talking about educating providers and stuff and then that's that's kind of a you know that's a a larger issue that I think is outside the scope of our pilot.
But I wanted to get your opinion at the TS Navigator one that's been involved in our pilot.
So our next phase of of this pilot we're planning to.
Talked to get enlisted, a couple of toxic exposure navigators, and we.
We're narrowing down the list of of potential sites and basically empowering them with the BHL tool and in building a kind of a way to port information from the power BI to find or identify, you know, several 100 patients at a time that have not had their first testing exposure screening and then having the the test navigator themselves be able to send that report out to them and and then be also responsible for following up for that second stage.
So wanted to get your thoughts on on that.I guess that construct.
0:14:21.100 --> 0:14:34.370

Participant 5:
I mean, I think it more is probably better in this situation in regards to what the VA is trying to do as a nation and and informed care, informed environmental exposure.
What is the? What is the push? Say it for me. Exposure. Informed care.
0:14:39.750 --> 0:14:39.870

Observer 1
Yes.
0:14:38.430 --> 0:14:52.770

Participant 5:
Umm, so I think the more information is better the opportunity to be able to provide that and and then a lot of people are data hungry you know they wanna see it cuz right.
You know, a lot of times with primary care. It's like, oh, God, it's another ICD 10 code I've got to put in.It's another question I got to ask. Is another thing to slow me down during the day, so if you had more, you know, education, it would make their job easier too. Would be 1 less button. They'd have to push if they just knew the dates to camp June or. Know how to answer it? I don't even know if that answers your question, but. I I do think I'm obviously. I'm always a advocate for educational opportunities, but I just don't know.
After I did an educational opportunity with Minneapolis primary care.
90 No, that's pretty high.Half and half were thank you for the the we didn't know anything about this.
We didn't understand what that even meant and the others were, you know, there was there was kickback because it was one more ICD 10 code.They had to put in for exposure to hazardous substances.
It was one more.
Consult they had to place.
0:15:57.90 --> 0:15:57.300

Observer 1
Sure.

Participant 5:
Well, we're not going to do that, are you?
Know what I'm saying?
So yeah, I mean it just.
0:15:57.310 --> 0:16:0.670

Observer 1
Yeah, yeah, it it.
0:16:3.270 --> 0:16:3.430

Participant 5:
Yeah.
0:16:5.720 --> 0:16:5.900

Participant 5:
Yeah.
0:16:0.680 --> 0:16:12.250
Observer 1
It it you know not my job jar and and honestly the the primary care folks have so many so many things that get piled into their job jar from all the different specialty clinics and reminders and things like that.
So I think the way that we're planning to pilot it, at least the workflow that we're that we're planning to exercise should address some of your issues you brought up as far as the PCP is not knowing when when those things happened because the that follow up TES reminder would now be being accomplished by a trained TES navigator professional.

But that shouldn't that should be able to address those in between the 1st and the 2nd.
0:16:39.900 --> 0:16:46.270

Observer 1
You know, when they when they called it complete, the reminder they should be able to to say Oh no, you're 22 years old. You weren't. You weren't campus you at the right time, so I think I'm gonna use that as another point and possibly another bit in our research questions as we develop our evaluation plan.
0:16:59.90 --> 0:16:59.720

Observer 1
So thank you.
0:17:0.220 --> 0:17:1.150

Participant 5:
Yeah, of course.
0:17:3.190 --> 0:17:8.810

Moderator:
(Redacted PII), I'm just gonna ask you questions now comparing E screening to having no tool at all.
So do you feel the east greeting tool has an appropriate level of safety in clinical integrity?
0:17:22.180 --> 0:17:22.730

Participant 5:
Yes.
Yeah, I can't think of, you know. No.
Yeah, of course.
Huh.
0:17:26.920 --> 0:17:27.220

Moderator:
OK.
0:17:28.590 --> 0:17:29.520

Moderator:
Why?
0:17:29.610 --> 0:17:30.70

Moderator:
I'm sorry.
0:17:32.710 --> 0:17:35.720

Participant 5:
Or because there's nothing I can't think of.
I was trying to the reason why I answered that way is I can't think of anything that was I can't think of any conduit other other than the difficulty of learning how to use it.
0:17:46.160 --> 0:17:46.480

Moderator:
OK.
0:17:46.470 --> 0:17:46.920

Participant 5:
I mean it.
It asked the right questions.
There's nothing.
There's no reading between the lines.
That's it's cut and dry.
0:17:53.210 --> 0:17:58.960

Moderator:
OK, so was your data simplified with the second tool?
0:18:0.410 --> 0:18:9.230

Moderator:
Sorry, your data entry was it simplified with the E screening tool where where did you notice more work?
0:18:14.520 --> 0:18:21.90

Participant 5:
Probably notice more work, but like I said, I don't think it's a fair assessment because I didn't get enough exposure to it.
I'd I'd have to have if everything takes time.
I think once Iknew what I was doing, I think it wouldn't have been challenging.
0:18:31.510 --> 0:18:41.820

Moderator:
Umm have you noticed an increase or decrease in the notifications you received about clinical reminders by switching to E screening versus no tool at all?
0:18:42.620 --> 0:18:43.990

Participant 5:
No, I haven't noticed any difference.
0:18:45.80 --> 0:18:45.790

Moderator:
OK.
0:18:46.240 --> 0:18:49.140

Moderator:
Would you agree or disagree with the following statement?
Overall clinical reminder burden has been reduced by switching to East Greening versus having no tool.
0:19:1.270 --> 0:19:4.240

Participant 5:
And it has to have been decreased over, yeah.
0:19:5.260 --> 0:19:6.130

Moderator:
OK, OK.
0:19:7.430 --> 0:19:22.360

Moderator:
Is there a way that you can estimate the time that it took for you to collect these clinical reminder responses versus having no tool? Is that possible for you to do? Knowing what you told me.
0:19:28.470 --> 0:19:30.490

Participant 5:
I think the the screening was a little.
0:19:57.670 --> 0:19:57.990

Moderator:
OK.
0:19:33.410 --> 0:20:0.230

Participant 5:
Maybe one too many steps because you've got to have CPRS open and then you've got to look to see what provider you know, you've got to read through the note, umm, and you got extra steps to take, although you got more information from what it is they were exposed to and if there was questions or no questions you had more but it it you still had an extra step like there was is back and forth through different programs.
0:20:1.470 --> 0:20:6.240

Moderator:
So how can the this the East screening tool be improved or changed?
0:20:6.290 --> 0:20:6.560

Moderator:
Finished.
0:20:11.600 --> 0:20:12.590

Participant 5:
No, I'm not IT. I'm the only one here too that knows how to do an Excel spreadsheet.
So a lot.
0:20:14.770 --> 0:20:17.580

Moderator:
In terms, yeah, in terms of your workflow?
0:20:22.650 --> 0:20:25.820

Participant 5:
I would just say there's gotta be a faster way.
I don't like the the the program dropped down with the MSP allergy.
The 4F clinic 4 E clinic 4D.
I just don't.
To me that seems cumbersome and I don't I should.

I should feel like I should just be able to separate it with reminders, like the kind of reminder I'm looking for. Umm.
And I'm not computer illiterate, I feel power BI.
I learned how to do it on my own and I could not figure this out on my own.
0:20:57.600 --> 0:20:59.770
Participant 5:
I feel like this program dropped down.
Maybe should go by reminder.
It should say reminder and then I can click on reminder T yes, the reminder that I'm looking for the date they were pulled, I suppose by clinic, but that doesn't really matter to me.
When I pulled Power BI reports, I would just delete the clinic and the provider who started it.
0:21:16.980 --> 0:21:17.280

Moderator:
OK.
0:21:15.400 --> 0:21:17.570

Participant 5:
Or it was sent to so I don't even look at that.
I'm not in the business of keeping track of that too, so I prefer just to have a have a drop down that separates the reminders that the person's looking for are tracking on their own.
0:21:28.520 --> 0:21:38.400

Moderator:
OK, if you can change one thing about this, what would it be about the east screening process and workflow for you?
0:21:40.470 --> 0:21:47.290

Participant 5:
Separate the remind be able just to get all the the only reminder I'm looking for on its own and then.
You know, keeping the want I can.
The one veteran ID like being able to put a DoD ID in or something.
I don't need the clinic.
The dates, of course, are fine.
I can do monthly, but I really just need a TS screen at ES positive first aid to 2nd to end date with the ability to search per social.
I don't.

0:22:13.820 --> 0:22:14.130
Moderator:
OK.

0:22:14.600 --> 0:22:16.60
Participant 5:
I don't like the clinic break up.
0:22:18.260 --> 0:22:18.580

Moderator:
OK.
0:22:18.190 --> 0:22:25.410

Participant 5:
Because a lot of people that are TS navigators that do this job, they don't even know their social workers a lot.
They're providers are not providers and they don't even know what those clinics mean.
0:22:30.400 --> 0:22:30.660

Moderator:
OK.
0:22:30.210 --> 0:22:37.720

Participant 5:
I mean where they are or anything, so it could, I think just per reminder instead of program or where their physically located.
0:22:39.570 --> 0:22:40.160

Moderator:
OK.
0:22:40.270 --> 0:22:47.440

Moderator:
Did you notice a difference in the quality of time you spend with patients after implementing the tutorials?
The screening tool.
0:22:49.760 --> 0:22:51.450

Participant 5:
No, it takes the same amount of time.
0:22:51.950 --> 0:22:52.280

Moderator:
It takes.
0:22:51.600 --> 0:22:55.580

Participant 5:
If you have a positive, you still have a 10 to 20 minute call with the patient.

Yeah, sometimes more.
0:22:56.550 --> 0:22:58.540
Moderator:
OK, alright.
0:22:59.210 --> 0:23:4.270

Moderator:
So I'm just going to compare this again with the.
So you had no no access to BHL but so, but you did use the power BI.
So we're going to compare Power BI with E screening.
Did you notice in difference in how long it took you to to in terms of increasing your workflow between the both tools?
0:23:35.480 --> 0:23:35.600

Participant 5:
Yes.
0:23:28.480 --> 0:23:38.470

Moderator:
So would you say that E screening has increased your time versus BHL or Power BI second?
0:23:37.660 --> 0:23:39.790

Participant 5:
Yeah, I can pull power BI.
Get here at 7.
OK. I pull power BI report of ITS screens and I can be done with the 15 that need follow up it by 8:00 o'clock by my first appointment, the East screening it, it would take me quite a bit longer to weed through those.

Moderator:
Can you just give me a rough estimate of how much longer it is?
0:24:3.410 --> 0:24:5.480

Participant 5:
Twice the amount, yeah.
0:24:1.720 --> 0:24:6.30

Moderator:
But was versus the power BI twice the amount?
0:24:6.40 --> 0:24:7.730

Moderator:
So maybe 2 hours then?
0:24:7.740 --> 0:24:8.930

Moderator:
Is that what you're saying?
0:24:7.630 --> 0:24:9.460

Moderator:
Is there anything else that you want to let me know about the east screening or the power BI that we haven't covered?
0:25:33.270 --> 0:25:48.800

Participant 5:
You know, I don't really even know this is kind of embarrassing, but I as I had my first primary care patient appointment myself at the VA, I never got any notification to complete screening for my reminders it with my very first one. So and I went through that with the LPN.
0:25:54.50 --> 0:25:54.340

Moderator:
OK.
0:25:51.170 --> 0:25:59.790

Participant 5:
I went through every single reminder with her and I never got any connection or link on to complete it before my appointment.
0:25:59.800 --> 0:26:6.650

Participant 5:
And was that random at first, who was getting those options to ease screen or how did that work?
0:26:6.490 --> 0:26:8.400

Observer 1
We're we we only we only.
0:26:14.630 --> 0:26:15.210

Observer 1
It's we only recruited 3 primary care clinics at Minneapolis, so it wasn't everybody.
0:26:19.480 --> 0:26:19.720

Participant 5:
I see.
0:26:15.840 --> 0:26:21.270

Observer 1
It was just, I don't know, the doctor's names off the top of my head, but it was it was only the three pack teams.
0:26:22.0 --> 0:26:22.490

Participant 5:
OK. Yeah, no worries. I just kind of wondered, you know it is kind of more my generation and younger that could figure that out and I was wondering I kind of figured it out you know but I didn't get it.
So I wondered how that worked.
I have anything else?
0:26:37.390 --> 0:26:37.860
