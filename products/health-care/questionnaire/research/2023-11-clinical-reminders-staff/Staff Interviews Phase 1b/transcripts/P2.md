0:0:0.0 --> 0:0:1.220
Participant 2: 
Yes, I am.
0:0:1.120 --> 0:0:1.570

Moderator:
Great.
0:0:1.860 --> 0:0:3.50

Moderator:
Thank you very much.
0:0:3.320 --> 0:0:4.840

Moderator:
So I just like to confirm. That you use the BHL tool in in the first part of the pilot and now you the second part you had switched to the E screening, is that correct?
0:0:16.610 --> 0:0:17.620

Participant 2: 
Yes, that's correct.
0:0:18.990 --> 0:0:23.260

Moderator:
Can you tell me how you were involved in in the pilot please?
0:0:24.250 --> 0:0:24.860

Participant 2: 
Sure. I’m the [redacted], on [redacted], so I worked with a one of LPN staff member that had volunteered mostly for the first uh part of the pilot with the BHL and the between the two of us, we sent out screening reminders for our clinic on four off.And then I also sent it out for [redacted],  as they don't have a manager right now, so I'm helping cover for that area. And so I sent them out. And then for the second part of the pilot I sent. Them out.
0:1:18.150 --> 0:1:18.450

Moderator:
OK.
0:1:0.600 --> 0:1:18.970

Participant 2: 
I did not involve the LPN cause the program was pretty complicated and we were running into a lot of IT issues and other issues, so it just I didn't see it to be a lot of value time added to spend doing that.
We're also very short LPN, so it didn't really seem to make sense.
0:1:24.560 --> 0:1:25.150

Moderator:
OK, good.
0:1:23.490 --> 0:1:33.400

Participant 2: 
So and I was encountering too many issues to expect staff to spend extra time navigating that I'm, you know, in addition to their regular workload, so.
0:1:34.390 --> 0:1:34.770

Moderator:
Hey, great.
0:1:34.780 --> 0:1:47.320

Moderator:
(Redacted PII), we'll go into those issues in a little bit later, but if you can first tell me, can you describe your onboarding process with the E screening tool?
0:1:49.80 --> 0:1:49.450

Participant 2: 
Sure. Like how I got started with the screening.
0:1:51.560 --> 0:1:53.970

Moderator:
Yes and yes, exactly. And the training.
0:1:57.570 --> 0:2:6.490

Participant 2: 
So there were, there were some issues with getting the program to load and getting into it.But I mean, I believe it was a video, maybe that watch for training, I, you know, kind of just worked through the system to on my own. And then I think we set up a teams meeting with someone to help troubleshoot some of the issues, which led to being connected with other staff to see about trying to fix some of the other issues as well. Umm, so I guess a series of meetings.
0:2:28.450 --> 0:2:36.320

Moderator:
So did you get so, did you get the program before you started the videos?
Just to play around with it or.
0:2:39.980 --> 0:2:41.160

Participant 2: 
I can't remember for sure.
0:2:42.50 --> 0:2:42.370
Moderator:
But you had the program in your possession and you were able to interact with it while you were while you were watching the videos. Is that correct?
0:2:50.980 --> 0:2:56.50

Participant 2: 
Yeah, but I don't believe all of our clinics were uploaded into the system, you know? So you could kind of see how it looked, but I couldn't really do.
0:3:1.460 --> 0:3:1.760

Moderator:
OK.
0:3:2.920 --> 0:3:3.480
Participant 2: 
Anything.
0:3:4.280 --> 0:3:7.210

Moderator:
How long did it take you to learn each screening?
0:3:8.690 --> 0:3:9.580

Participant 2: 
Ohm. It took weeks to get it up and running for sure. So I guess weeks because it couldn't really learn it until we could start using it. And then, yeah.
0:3:23.20 --> 0:3:25.560

Moderator:
So why did? Why do you suppose it took weeks? Was it something technical or that it was something else?
0:3:33.170 --> 0:3:35.100

Participant 2: 
Yeah, there was various issues. You know, it wasn't just like ready to go. So I felt like I had to do quite a bit of work on my end to like figure out who could help me. Problem solve?
0:3:47.840 --> 0:4:2.610

Participant 2: 
And then, you know, like we didn't have teams and then we, you know, someone was able to get some of those added and then there was, you know, issues with checking the patient in and not having a non uncounterable clinic, umm.
0:4:2.620 --> 0:4:9.510

Participant 2: 
And then there was just issues with the system, not sometimes not working like it would just not the site wouldn't load.
0:4:12.900 --> 0:4:13.70

Moderator:
It's.
0:4:12.480 --> 0:4:14.110

Participant 2: 
So you know there be days. I'd try to get on to the system once we did get all those other issues worked out, there would be days I'd tried to log on to the system and it would just spin and then I would try a couple hours later and it would just spin. So it felt like a really long process. Then there was maybe like a week and 1/2 or two weeks that it worked pretty good. And then it kind of stopped working again and to be honest, I was just didn't have any more time to keep going in there to try and use it. So I didn't use it anymore.
0:4:43.750 --> 0:4:49.40

Moderator:
So did you like a POC for onboarding and training initially? Did you not receive one?
0:4:50.990 --> 0:5:5.20

Participant 2: 
No, there is definitely people that contacts, but it was still a lot of legwork for our ourselves as managers to figure things out or someone might help us with something they could. And then they would recommend someone else for that part of it. Or you know, so it was a lot of just jumping around to different people who are all able to help eventually, but that's a lot of time and.
0:5:28.420 --> 0:5:28.730

Moderator:
So I.
0:5:19.110 --> 0:5:34.970

Participant 2: 
You know, ideally it would have been nice if it was just all set up, ready to go and then we could have utilized it that way, which is the reason I didn't involve other staff because it really there was a lot of issues and it wasn't really ready to go so.
0:5:37.530 --> 0:5:45.140

Moderator:
I think I know the answer to this question, but on a scale of one to five, with one being very easy and five being very difficult.
0:5:45.470 --> 0:5:50.690

Moderator:
How easy or difficult was it to learn and to use E screening?
0:5:52.660 --> 0:5:54.650

Participant 2: 
I would say a 5. I think that you know now that I know how to do it it's fine, but the system doesn't seem to work and I don't think I would ever choose to roll it out to staff. I think it would end up being more time for them and it would not be a time saver, and I think there's a lot of room for error, especially with the part of how you have to create have to choose the non count clinic when you're trying to save your data. I think we'll have a lot of staff who have a lot of cuz. It's not like you just pick it, you have to also hit save and then you have to go.There's go. There are a couple steps in there which are clinics are really busy and I could see that getting missed a lot with our staff, which would create, which would, you know, we don't want patients getting checked in for appointments which we figured out what's happening at the beginning of the pilot and that's why we had to create the Noncount clinic.  So there's just some things in there.
There's a lot of room for error and I think also with how often this system wasn't working, my staff just don't have time to go in and keep trying. So I would say it's very difficult to use.
0:7:5.920 --> 0:7:8.190

Moderator:
OK, go.
0:7:6.110 --> 0:7:9.130

Participant 2: 
So I mean, yeah.
0:7:8.720 --> 0:7:21.390

Moderator:
Going back to the onboarding and training, how did that the E screening differ from the BHL on boarding and training and which a training process do you prefer and why?
0:7:23.600 --> 0:7:37.830

Participant 2: 
Umm, I think that you know, there was still some issues with BHL took a little bit to get a few things fixed too, but it was not nearly as complicated and time consuming. And it was much easier for me to spend 15 minutes with my staff member here to show her how to do it. Once I got all that set up stuff figured out with people. And so that was much more manageable as far as what I would envision. You know the education it. It's easier. It was easy for me to provide my own hands on education, to staff so that they could just. Learn that way too. So.
0:8:9.300 --> 0:8:13.230

Moderator:
Are you are you referring to the 2nd or the 1st tool?
0:8:13.670 --> 0:8:14.520

Participant 2: 
First tool.
0:8:15.130 --> 0:8:16.800

Participant 2: 
Yeah. Yep.
0:8:14.670 --> 0:8:24.920

Moderator:
First two of the BHL OK if you could change one thing about onboarding and training that you received within E screening, what would it be?
0:8:34.880 --> 0:8:35.220

Participant 2: 
I guess.  don't know about the. The training was kind of.I don't know.
0:8:50.800 --> 0:8:52.660

Moderator:
What would you have liked to see (Redacted PII)?
0:9:3.670 --> 0:9:4.530

Moderator:
Yes, of course.
0:8:49.550 --> 0:9:14.190

Participant 2: 
I just that the system, I guess that that it just worked from the start and that things were ready to go because it's really hard to learn something if this systems not working if that makes sense because then you're not really, you know, you're more than all of a sudden you're putting a I guess I felt like I was putting it in a troubleshooting role for a system that I hadn't. Wasn't didn't really know how to use if that makes sense. So I was kind of felt like I was leading the. Yeah, the process of trying to make this system work for us, but yet I really didn't know the system myself. So that's a hard spot to be put in.
0:9:30.820 --> 0:9:47.480

Moderator:
So now just you kind of mentioned that your experience with using E screening, but if you can just walk me through your final process for sending, receiving and reviewing the questionnaires with E screening?
0:9:49.440 --> 0:9:54.0

Participant 2: 
Yeah, I'd have to go back to it because I don't really remember. It's been several weeks. Let's see if I can get load here. So I would go to the east screening and then trying to get it to load right now.But I would do create a battery, Choose my dates, And my the clinic. So that was a part of the beginning. We had to get clinics added and .That sort of thing. Trying to find a clinic that will load so I can go to the next step.
And then would have, you know, patients that would result under the search and then for whatever day Orange I pick then you can select those veterans. And so I'm doing it for a clinic here, and it's just spinning.
.
0:11:51.700 --> 0:11:56.470

Moderator:
So these are patients that that have appointments that you need to send them out, OK.
0:11:56.10 --> 0:11:59.0

Participant 2: 
Yeah, within the time I just picked the next week. So as an example, so within there or next three days so. And then.
0:12:4.480 --> 0:12:5.500

Moderator:
And so would you do that? So would you do that once a week or how often did you do this every day or?
0:12:13.310 --> 0:12:19.650

Participant 2: 
Umm I would so this one is different than the other program and that it sends it out right away. Whereas the other one sent it out. I think 2 days before if I can remember correctly, so I did this well when I was able to use it, I would try and do it every couple of days. Or like a Monday and. Monday for the week, I'm on our Friday for the next week or kind of just depended when I had time or when it actually loaded.
So here, now it just finally loaded the next screen. And then you would pick your. Your program, your note title, the clinician.
0:13:12.610 --> 0:13:12.910

Moderator:
OK.
0:13:13.270 --> 0:13:15.960

Participant 2: 
And then yeah, like right now it's not it's. I'm waiting for it to load the reminder part still, so this is what would happen a lot. It was, you know, it would take a long time for this.
0:13:25.530 --> 0:13:32.590

Moderator:
So when you sent them out, how did you review when you reviewed what was the process for that when you were reviewing?
0:13:35.260 --> 0:13:35.630

Participant 2: 
Yeah. Then I would just go back into the dashboard and keep an eye on things coming back and then go through the process of things that. We're complete and then upload them into that chart. And then making sure that I didn't check them into their appointments and so forth.
0:14:2.370 --> 0:14:2.550

Moderator:
OK.
0:14:2.270 --> 0:14:3.550

Participant 2: 
And then umm.And that was like under the dashboard you could see like I could see the ones that Alice and the other person doing it. So sometimes I would be like a long a big group of them and I would have to filter through to just see my own as well.
0:14:22.620 --> 0:14:29.510

Moderator:
So how well did the E screening integrate into your existing software and processes?
0:14:31.750 --> 0:14:33.10

Participant 2: 
Umm, not well.
0:14:34.610 --> 0:14:39.220

Moderator:
Did you have to create work arounds for ease screening?
0:14:40.840 --> 0:14:42.40

Participant 2: 
Uh, definitely. Just definitely. Had to. I mean, it's hard to I guess create I, I just used it one in the system was working and then didn't use it when it wasn't and just did our traditional check in process. So how?
0:15:1.520 --> 0:15:2.610

Moderator:
What do you estimate? How? How many times have you used it? Would you say throughout the second part of the pilot?
0:15:10.970 --> 0:15:12.0
Participant 2: 
Not exactly. I don't know for sure the data. There is a probably a week or two that I sent quite a few of them out, but then I would say I tried at least 15 times or more in the following weeks and it never.
It just wouldn't load or it was just spinning and taking too long and I'd have to go do something  I was not able to send anything else out in the last part of the pilot because the system wasn't efficient enough to be able to work it with my current day.
0:15:43.800 --> 0:15:44.750

Moderator:
You remember when? When was the last time you sent out?
0:15:49.620 --> 0:15:50.480

Participant 2: 
I can see if it's.I can see from the system but. No where would find that in there for sure.Umm, I don't know. It might have been early April. I don't.
0:16:22.770 --> 0:16:24.610

Moderator:
Early April. Good.
0:16:22.810 --> 0:16:27.150

Participant 2: 
I'm sorry I don't know a specific date, but it's probably realistically really wrong.
0:16:26.500 --> 0:16:29.220

Moderator:
Yeah, just a rough estimate.
0:16:29.320 --> 0:16:29.500

Participant 2: 
Yeah.
0:16:29.230 --> 0:16:30.730

Moderator:
It doesn't have to be detailed.
0:16:31.890 --> 0:16:32.230

Participant 2: 
Umm.
0:16:31.0 --> 0:16:33.470

Moderator:
Thank you so early April.
0:16:34.320 --> 0:16:42.880

Moderator:
So how would you say this stream work stream with the E screening compared to the BHL work stream?
0:16:44.820 --> 0:16:50.190

Participant 2: 
I think I definitely would prefer the BHL it. It was more user friendly. I didn't run into as many areas of issues related to like loading things. There was things about BHL that were much it saved time.
I could pull create a clinic pack group of multiple doctors and create, you know, and send reminders out for a larger group of patients and teams. Whereas in East screening I could only pick one doctor at a time, they're also wasn't a lot of different steps to remember to send things out under BHL.
0:17:31.670 --> 0:17:34.460

Moderator:
And in east, screening required several steps for you.
0:17:34.280 --> 0:17:35.510
Participant 2: 
Yes, correct.
0:17:35.520 --> 0:17:36.810

Participant 2: 
Yeah. Yep.
0:17:35.420 --> 0:17:37.50

Moderator:
OK, right.
0:17:37.860 --> 0:17:43.800

Moderator:
So I'm just going to ask you to compare ease screening with just having no tool in general Umm did you notice a difference in the quality time you spend with patients after implementing E screening?
0:17:53.890 --> 0:18:2.330

Participant 2: 
Umm, I would say I spent more time trying to get E screening to work than what the actual value that was. You know of the amount that actually came back, which is why you know it in my role, I wouldn't choose to roll it out to staff for that reason unless there were some very huge dramatic improvements.
But I think they would spend it would be more time efficient for them just to ask the patients the question in person.
0:18:25.40 --> 0:18:30.870

Moderator:
So is it fair to say that your data entry wasn't simplified then with the eye screening?
0:18:30.110 --> 0:18:31.770

Participant 2: 
Correct. Yeah.
0:18:31.580 --> 0:18:40.660

Moderator:
OK, have you noticed an increase or decrease in the notifications you received about the clinical reminders?
0:18:43.740 --> 0:18:45.470

Participant 2: 
Probably just the. Same, I guess, yeah.
0:18:48.680 --> 0:18:52.410

Moderator:
Same as no, as not having a tool. Right.
0:18:53.290 --> 0:18:53.510

Participant 2: 
Yeah.
0:18:54.460 --> 0:18:54.780

Moderator:
OK, would you agree or disagree with the following statement? Overall clinic reminder Burden has been reduced by implementing E screening tool.
0:19:6.590 --> 0:19:6.920

Participant 2: 
Uh, It on unchanged? Yeah.
0:19:11.580 --> 0:19:12.290

Moderator:
Unchanged.
0:19:11.980 --> 0:19:18.590

Participant 2: 
Or yeah, or the burden was not changed, or I increased. I guess I found the system to be more work.
0:19:22.140 --> 0:19:26.160
.
Moderator:
How much time would you estimate that it added to? Your uh to your process in comparison to having no screening tool at all.
0:19:42.220 --> 0:19:43.300

Participant 2: 
I don't know what I mean. We are only doing reminders for a small amount of reminders, so the value added was very, you know, small for those who they did successfully go out and completed it.So I don't really know for sure what the answer you know time wise specifically would be but umm.
0:20:14.510 --> 0:20:15.810

Moderator:
OK, that's fine.
0:20:15.520 --> 0:20:16.290

Participant 2: 
Yeah, sorry.
0:20:16.350 --> 0:20:23.630

Moderator:
So do you feel that E screening did maintain an appropriate level of safety in clinical integrity?
0:20:27.80 --> 0:20:27.290

Participant 2: 
Sure.
0:20:26.750 --> 0:20:29.110

Moderator:
In comparison to not having a screening tool.
0:20:32.380 --> 0:20:37.0

Participant 2: 
Umm, I mean I think it was. It’s probably safe. When it went out but not having a screening tool would just be staff asking in person, which is just also safe. So I don't know that it was safer, if that makes sense, you know.
0:20:50.620 --> 0:20:52.620

Moderator:
Yes, OK.
0:20:52.860 --> 0:20:59.460

Moderator:
If you could change one thing about the east screening process clinical reminder process, what would it be?
0:21:2.840 --> 0:21:5.220

Participant 2: 
Umm, I think having a. I mean. The ability to choose more than one. Doctor or team and to have it all loaded in.One ideally you should only have to click a few things and then you can send it out.
The system requires so simplifying I guess and improving the functionality of the actual system itself. So I know that's a big thing. Not, and not just one thing, but yeah.
0:21:52.90 --> 0:21:53.500

Moderator:
Kristen, 
Do you have any questions on this part or (Redacted PII) or like I can move on?
0:22:4.380 --> 0:22:6.130

Notetaker
I don't have any questions on that part.
0:22:6.590 --> 0:22:7.100
Moderator:
OK.
0:22:7.150 --> 0:22:21.280

Moderator:
So, (Redacted PII), I'm going to ask you now your opinion on comparing the difference in quality of time you spend with your patients after implementing E screening versus BHL Did you notice the difference between the two?
0:22:27.20 --> 0:22:28.70

Participant 2: 
Umm, you know? So I don't check patients in on a regular basis. But I supervised the staff that do and I'll help if they need help. So I don't have, you know, a lot of. Uh personal feedback to provide on, you know, the time spent with patients, but I can just share that my staff when using the BHL reported patients, providing them positive feedback when they were being checked in regarding. The what they received during that first part of the pilot, there was a lot of positive feedback from patients that it was go ahead, yes.
0:23:10.130 --> 0:23:17.650

Moderator:
And did you get from patients OK and how about staff, how did they feel about the HL?
0:23:18.310 --> 0:23:23.430

Participant 2: 
I'm very positive when it we had to switch to the other system, people noticed. Yes.
0:23:24.610 --> 0:23:27.750

Moderator:
They noticed the difference between DHL and E screening. What were some comments about the E screening in comparison to BHO?
0:23:33.50 --> 0:23:47.570

Participant 2: 
I think more that we were able to successfully send more out via BHL so they notice an improvement in their workload, whereas we are not able to successfully send as much out through E screening.
0:23:48.990 --> 0:23:50.60

Moderator:
So it didn't. So the escreening didn't lessen their burden with the time, the quality of time.
0:23:56.10 --> 0:23:57.670

Participant 2: 
Correct, yes.
0:23:58.110 --> 0:24:7.240

Moderator:
OK, do you know if their data was simplified versus a screening in BHL like?
0:24:9.680 --> 0:24:16.740

Participant 2: 
I mean, I think it just took what you know, I can't remember if it was four or five reminders off the list. So it's certainly helps. Ideally, if we were able to get a program, it would be nice to add other reminders to the east screening if we can to help. There's, there's a lot of reminders and staff have a lot of reminders, so even.
0:24:46.390 --> 0:24:47.60

Moderator:
How many?
0:24:33.240 --> 0:24:47.450

Participant 2: 
What the positive feedback from BHL staff expressed, it would be nice if we could add additional reminders to the east screening to cause there's still they still have to come in and they still need to ask a lot of questions in addition to what we sent out so.
0:24:47.70 --> 0:24:50.410

How many reminders would you like to see sent out?
0:24:50.860 --> 0:24:57.70

Participant 2: 
It certainly would be nice to send out as many as we are allowed to that are appropriate for that.
0:24:57.710 --> 0:24:57.990

Moderator:
Right.
0:24:57.460 --> 0:25:14.660

Participant 2: 
You know, obviously there are some that probably need to be asked in person, but if we could maximize and send out anything that, you know the facility would deem appropriate for a E screening type tool, I think that would be ideal because we did have pretty good response rate. I think especially with HLS and patients seemed to say it was easy for them to complete, so that would definitely save on the check in time if we can get as many done as we can prior to the appointment.
0:25:30.500 --> 0:25:40.140

Moderator:
Have you noticed a decrease or increase in notifications you received an in screening you screening versus BHO, I'm sorry.
0:25:40.950 --> 0:25:42.30

Participant 2: 
Yeah, no problem. BHL did have a lot of emails that would come through and you're.
Umm, when things were ready to be uploaded, I think it would be great if we went with BHL if we could make a way so that it automatically just goes. That email could be removed and it could just automatically go to CPRS because you have to review the note anyway before you sign and see progress.
So we if there was and it seemed like when I talked to people about BHL in the beginning, that that was something they were working on, but if there was a way to skip that middle step that would streamline it even more for staff and reduce like the email burden because you would just go on to CPRS and see that you have an unsigned note and then you can review it and sign it if it's appropriate.
And that would work better for staff's workflow because they work out of CPS all day anyway, so they would be seeing those come through throughout the day and could just take care of them.
Umm so that could reduce that notification.

0:26:48.700 --> 0:26:48.980
Moderator:
So.

0:26:48.430 --> 0:26:49.940
Participant 2: 
Piece as far as the email goes.
0:26:50.960 --> 0:26:52.270

Moderator:
So how about escreen? Did there? Was there are a lot of notifications from that tool?
0:26:57.750 --> 0:27:0.180

Participant 2: 
No, I don't think I got any emails. I'm trying to remember if I did. I don't think I did.
I would just go to the dashboard, but that might have been how I had my settings set up.
I can't remember.
0:27:12.670 --> 0:27:12.920

Moderator:
So.
0:27:12.530 --> 0:27:13.310

Participant 2: 
But maybe I didn't.
0:27:14.920 --> 0:27:20.850

Moderator:
So again, I know the answer to this question, but would you agree or disagree with the following statement? Overall clinical reminder burden has been reduced by implementing E screening versus PHL.
0:27:31.220 --> 0:27:34.70

Participant 2: 
Umm, which one? I think reduced it or what's?
0:27:37.800 --> 0:27:42.490

Moderator:
I mean, if I were to say to you E screening is better at reducing?
0:27:45.640 --> 0:27:47.850
Moderator:

Yeah, staff burden.
0:27:49.960 --> 0:27:54.780

Moderator:
Would you agree with that in comparison to PHL, or would you disagree?
0:27:55.870 --> 0:27:57.360

Participant 2: 
I wouldn't disagree.
0:28:1.590 --> 0:28:1.850

Moderator:
OK.
0:27:57.370 --> 0:28:8.300

Participant 2: 
I did not did not feel E screening helped with the clinical reminder burden I did feel BHL helped with the clinical reminder Bird.
0:28:8.670 --> 0:28:10.570

Moderator:
Think so?
0:28:10.920 --> 0:28:17.770

Moderator:
How much time did you would you estimate that the BHL, umm, saved
In a staff members versus he screening.
0:28:27.30 --> 0:28:31.940

Participant 2: 
OH, it's hard to say because every patient has a different reminders. Do, but you know potentially could say 5 to 10 minutes per patient if they had all of the available options do, I guess. But that varies 
You know, some patients might have only had one or they might not have had any of them.
But if they had all of them in like, including the toxic exposure, that could save 5 to 10 minutes per patient. And I guess it would. You know, I could send a batter or said wasn't isn't called a battery, but I could send a BHL. I could send a list of screenings out to. Umm, you know, six doctors and I could do that. And you know, within a couple minutes. So that piece was certainly very time efficient.
0:29:20.570 --> 0:29:21.750

Participant 2: 
As far as sending it out.
0:29:23.740 --> 0:29:24.670

Moderator:
Right, (Redacted PII).
And if you had a choice on which tool would you like to implement a nationwide? Which one would you choose and why?
0:29:35.570 --> 0:29:43.630

Participant 2: 
Have definitely choose the first tool BHL for a lot of the reasons mentioned earlier.
It was just work. It was easy to learn and it would be easy for me to teach my staff personally.
And was effective in it, you know, patients reported it was easy for them to respond.
I would not choose the second tool as I couldn't. I couldn't get it to consistently or reliably work myself, so I would never expect or ask staff to use that or work that into their workflow because they're already very busy. So it just it would be a large dissatisfactory I think for their jobs and it also just wouldn't result in good patient care. Would be better for them to just take care of what's in front of them.

Moderator:
Right, right.
0:30:39.920 --> 0:30:40.920

Participant 2: 
Correct. Yeah.
0:30:34.50 --> 0:30:45.330

Moderator:
And it's actually doing the opposite of what it was intending to do, right, Kristen, do you have anything before we close out today?
0:30:46.200 --> 0:30:48.480
Notetaker
No, thank you for sharing all your insights.
0:30:48.840 --> 0:30:50.230

Participant 2: 
Yeah, of course.
0:30:49.860 --> 0:30:56.570

Moderator:
Is there anything you'd like to talk about or mention before we go (Redacted PII)?
0:30:57.480 --> 0:30:59.450

Participant 2: 
No, I think no.
0:30:59.610 --> 0:31:0.170

Participant 2: 
I think I'm.
0:31:1.130 --> 0:31:1.450

Moderator:
OK.
0:31:1.450 --> 0:31:2.540

Participant 2: 
Are they said it all?
0:31:2.550 --> 0:31:5.250

Participant 2: 
Do we know when they're going to decide or how?
0:31:7.70 --> 0:31:8.200

Participant 2: 
How the?
0:31:7.440 --> 0:31:9.970

Moderator:
I'm going to let Kristen answer that question.
0:31:12.850 --> 0:31:13.150

Participant 2: 
OK.
0:31:10.780 --> 0:31:18.390

Notetaker
Well, we still have some more interviews to do here, and then we'll take all that and synthesize it and make our final recommendations and then start those conversations.
0:31:21.30 --> 0:31:21.310

Participant 2: 
OK.
0:31:18.400 --> 0:31:26.10

Notetaker
So I still think it'll be a little bit, but we are on the path to having all the data from everything that you've helped us with.
0:31:26.20 --> 0:31:26.750

Notetaker
So thank you.
0:31:26.760 --> 0:31:30.190

Notetaker
It'll definitely make us make a informed decision.
0:31:30.910 --> 0:31:32.100

Participant 2: 
OK, awesome.
0:31:32.410 --> 0:31:33.690
