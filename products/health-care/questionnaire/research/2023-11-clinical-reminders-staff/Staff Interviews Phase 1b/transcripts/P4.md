0:1:3.510 --> 0:1:13.260

Moderator:
So just to confirm that you use the eScreening in the beginning of the pilot and you switch to the BHL tool, is that correct?
0:1:12.170 --> 0:1:13.560

P4:
Yes. Yeah.
0:1:14.390 --> 0:1:19.400

Moderator:
Can you tell me how you were involved in the clinical reminders pilot, please?
0:1:21.870 --> 0:1:27.190
P4:
I'm an LPN and here in the Butler VA, the LPN's room, the patients.
0:1:30.260 --> 0:1:31.150

Moderator:
And you. Get them ready for the providers.
0:1:32.170 --> 0:1:33.890

P4:
Go through all the health prevention questions.
0:1:35.660 --> 0:1:35.930
Moderator:
OK.
0:1:39.300 --> 0:1:43.760

So you actually room with the patients and asking the questions, is that correct?
0:1:44.370 --> 0:1:44.530

P4:
Yes.
0:1:45.460 --> 0:1:45.950

Moderator:
OK.
0:1:46.320 --> 0:1:51.960

Moderator:
So can you describe your onboarding process with BHL please?
0:1:54.150 --> 0:1:56.740

P4:
When you say onboarding, I don't know. I think I was just volunteered for him.
0:2:17.0 --> 0:2:18.690

P4:
Let me try to see if I can go in a room.
0:2:55.500 --> 0:2:58.870

Moderator:
Alright, so you're onboarding process.
0:2:58.880 --> 0:3:0.950

Moderator:
You said that you're not sure. Did you? Were you introduced to BHL?
0:3:4.310 --> 0:3:13.410

P4:
No, I think I was told that I was going to participate in it, and it was just given instructions on how to, you know, get ready for it and all that.
0:3:14.920 --> 0:3:17.210

Moderator:
Did you receive any training on BHL?
0:3:19.420 --> 0:3:25.270

P4:
Think I was gone when the training occurred, so it was very self explanatory. It wasn't very difficult for me to catch on to it at all.
0:3:30.560 --> 0:3:37.750

Moderator:
So on a scale of 1 to 5, how easy or difficult was it to learn to use the BHL tool?
0:3:37.760 --> 0:3:40.550

Moderator:
One being very easy and five being very difficult.
0:3:41.230 --> 0:3:41.610

P4:
1.
0:3:45.570 --> 0:3:53.980

Moderator:
How did the how did this training or learning the tool differ from the EScreening?
0:3:55.370 --> 0:3:56.140

P4:
It was a lot easier.
0:3:54.800 --> 0:3:56.850

Moderator:
Can you compare and contrast the two?
0:3:57.320 --> 0:3:58.930

P4:
It was a lot easier to navigate.
0:4:0.70 --> 0:4:8.510

Moderator:
Can you provide a little bit more detail and specifics on what you found easier and what you found more difficult in the in the Screening tool?
0:4:9.340 --> 0:4:18.90

P4:
The steps there was way less steps in doing BHL than what there was with E screening plus the I don't know the escreening, I just didn't really like it. It is very hard. It was very it was not user friendly.
0:4:28.130 --> 0:4:29.620

Moderator:
Do you remember specifics? What you didn't like about the eScreening?
0:4:35.720 --> 0:4:40.390

P4:
I'm thinking it was more like they had to have the email address. I don't think the tax message thing had ever gone through with that one. And it was, I mean, a lot of our veterans are older. They don't check their emails every day. We would get sometimes them responding to it after the appointment already occurred. 
0:5:2.870 --> 0:5:18.60

Moderator:
Alright, so if you could change one thing about the training that you received on BHL and you had mentioned that you really didn't receive any training, but what would you like to see in the future on BHL in terms of training and on boarding?
0:5:24.600 --> 0:5:27.500

P4:
 Because I don't think it was that easy that hard to navigate at all. So it was kind of self explanatory. I remember some person showed me one thing on how to add my clinics altogether, and that was probably the hardest part, but that wasn't difficult either.
0:5:41.180 --> 0:5:44.100

Moderator:
OK, can So what was hard about it?
0:5:45.510 --> 0:5:49.870

P4:
Just trying to figure out how to add the all your teams into one group. So like when I went in there and hit pack nine, they all fell under the same thing.
0:5:57.260 --> 0:6:0.180

Moderator:
What role did this person play in your clinic? 
0:6:0.810 --> 0:6:6.410

P4:
I think it actually was just one of the other girls that are doing the BHL along with me.
0:6:7.590 --> 0:6:8.940

Moderator:
Is she an LPN too?
0:6:9.250 --> 0:6:10.930

P4:
Now I think she's an MSA.
0:6:15.560 --> 0:6:23.860

Moderator:
Can you walk me through your final process for sending, receiving and reviewing the questionnaires and BHL?
0:6:25.60 --> 0:6:27.830

P4:
I go in every Thursday, I set up. I don't know the BHL to go out to everybody the following week on Monday for the week and I it's so simple. I just had pack nine, hit health prevention, and send, and it goes out to all the veterans that are scheduled. And then I by Monday, I start getting them in. So it's real simple. I review them once I go into CPRS to sign them off.
0:7:6.840 --> 0:7:14.110

Moderator:
what do you recall anything in particular that you like about BHL?
0:7:14.120 --> 0:7:15.320

Moderator:
Other than that was simple. I mean, I like the fact that they can answer some of the questions before the appointment ahead of time. I mean, I don't see it really saving a whole lot of time yet because there's not a whole lot of questions on it. So it really doesn't save me a whole lot of time yet. It would be nice if it. Probably had a lot more questions on it to save me more time.
0:7:46.320 --> 0:7:50.700

Moderator:
I also do you recall anything that you don't like about the tool?
0:7:52.430 --> 0:7:56.270

P4:
The only thing I don't like is if I'm not here, like yesterday. Somebody covered for me because I had a call off because my I just stay at home with a kid that was sick. So all those came through under my name and they were already seen. There's not a way, that if I call off, to inform somebody else that there's BHL in there to complete; I get the notification. Nobody else gets the notification, so when the nurse is covering me, goes into the chart, she's not going to look and see that there's an unsigned note. So it gets skipped if the person on that team is not there for the day.
0:8:42.740 --> 0:8:43.790

Moderator:
OK, get skipped.
0:8:43.800 --> 0:8:49.250

Moderator:
So that means they asked the question, do they veteran the same question? Yeah.
0:8:46.970 --> 0:8:54.250

P4:
They review all the questions and then when I come back in, I have to sign off on all those.
0:8:55.520 --> 0:8:55.790

Moderator:
OK. So OK, so that's very good feedback. Thank you for that.

0:9:0.950 --> 0:9:9.360
Moderator:
So you would like a way that's that if someone calls it like if you call in sick essentially that someone else can just take over.
0:9:9.350 --> 0:9:13.300

P4:
Or if I was on vacation, like if I would send it out on a Thursday. But I'm gone the next week. It's not going to get completed. So I there has to be something that's kind of universal I guess.So I guess other people are notified that it's there, maybe not just the LPN or the person that puts in the BHL, maybe the whole team.
0:9:39.780 --> 0:9:40.180

Moderator:
OK.
0:9:41.560 --> 0:9:42.10

P4:
I don't know.
0:9:43.520 --> 0:9:45.490

Moderator:
Redacted PII Redacted PII has a question.

0:9:45.500 --> 0:9:48.260

Moderator:
So I'm going to have him just ask it.
0:9:50.810 --> 0:9:55.90

Observer 1
So I just wanted to see the were you aware of the surrogate function? In in inside of BHL?
0:9:59.90 --> 0:10:3.870

P4:
I'm saying like I would understand that as a surrogate function if. But here's the thing about Butler and how it works. You never know who's going to cover you that day. That LPN's have no idea who's going to cover them while they're on vacation. So it's kind of hard to have a surrogate.
0:10:22.590 --> 0:10:34.660

Observer 1
Yeah, that that makes sense that we, we've dealt with this this feedback before and we're they're trying to the vendors are trying to find, you know, elegant solutions to fix it. But I do know not a lot of people are aware of the surrogate function inside of BHL where you can say I'm going on vacation next week and I'm going to have somebody else cover my load. So those people will also get the notifications.
0:10:50.370 --> 0:10:55.290

P4:
So the only people that have surrogates here at the VA are the RN's and the providers. That's it.
0:10:57.350 --> 0:10:58.780

Observer 1
So I'm not talking about surrogate in the in CPRS, you can actually do it inside the [BHL] tool to where they'll get the emails that, yeah.
0:11:8.570 --> 0:11:12.630

P4:
That that LPNS don't have anybody that takes over their team when they're on vacation. We don't have a specific person. And the AMSAs don't have a specific person to take care of their load whenever they're going to.

0:11:23.430 --> 0:11:23.830
Observer 1
Got it.
0:11:24.350 --> 0:11:28.200

Moderator:
This is unique to Butler, in particular, right?
0:11:28.210 --> 0:11:31.140

Moderator:
Not necessarily?
0:11:28.870 --> 0:11:33.620

P4:
I don't know if it is or if, but I that's why I said.
0:11:33.630 --> 0:11:43.260

P4:
Maybe if the team, every team member was on the BHL were not all off on the same time, you know at the same time. So somebody on the team is going to get it.
0:11:53.280 --> 0:11:55.350

Moderator:
Redacted PII, do you have any additional follow ups?
0:11:58.620 --> 0:12:3.510

Moderator:
On a scale one to five, with one being very easy and five being very difficult.
0:12:3.520 --> 0:12:6.950

Moderator:
How easy or difficult was it to use BHL?
0:12:8.130 --> 0:12:8.410

P4:
1.
0:12:9.130 --> 0:12:17.90

Moderator:
Want very easy and how well did BHL integrate into your existing software and processes?
0:12:18.900 --> 0:12:20.510

P4:
I think it integrated very well. I don't think we had any difficulties really.

0:12:23.460 --> 0:12:27.460

Moderator:
Did you have to create any workaround processes because of the BHL?
0:12:28.240 --> 0:12:29.80

P4:
No, I didn't.
0:12:29.860 --> 0:12:34.390

Moderator:
OK, so how did that compare to the E screening Did that integrate into your software well, or not?
0:12:40.100 --> 0:12:44.210

P4:
EScreening we had some issues with eye screening. I'm trying to think it's been so long ago now.  I can't recall, but I know there was some issues that came up.
0:13:3.530 --> 0:13:12.690

Moderator:
So did you notice a difference in the quality of time you spend with patients after implementing the BHL in comparison to having no tool at all?
0:13:14.940 --> 0:13:26.920

P4:
 2 minutes. I mean with maybe saving 4 questions, it maybe would save me like a few minutes, maybe a 2 minutes, because I can get through the questions pretty quickly. I've been here 13 years, I know them off the top of my head so I can get put through them pretty fast and. I think the only downside to the questions is if sometimes the veterans will do them right before I bring them in a room and I don't notice them being completed, so that sometimes is a problem. I think there should be a time out a certain amount of time prior to an appointment coming into an appointment that it should time out that they shouldn't be able to do it anymore. 
0:14:14.420 --> 0:14:19.900

Moderator:
So another words it could have been the veteran completed those questions while they were waiting to see you.
0:14:20.580 --> 0:14:20.840

P4:
Yeah.
0:14:19.910 --> 0:14:24.700

Moderator:
And then by the time you saw that, OK, so you'd like to have? Yeah.
0:14:22.810 --> 0:14:30.900

P4:
Yeah, I think there should be at least a time out at least maybe a couple hours prior to appointment or an hour.
0:14:33.770 --> 0:14:39.180 

Moderator:
And is that the only scenario where you would miss those questions? What's another scenario?
0:14:40.30 --> 0:14:49.120

P4:
Those two where I missed where I missed work and yeah, if they were already on the schedule and I was doing my work for the day and bringing them in. And it's I think it's more of me having to get used to just looking at the notifications prior to bringing a veteran in the room, but I still think it should time out. Maybe you know an hour or half hour prior to their appointment.
0:15:6.600 --> 0:15:12.580
b
0:15:11.370 --> 0:15:14.790

P4:
And it's still, we're still getting our feet wet with it. You know, so it's still a learning process.
0:15:21.860 --> 0:15:24.790

Moderator:
Was did you notice whether your data was simplified With implementing BHL at all?
0:15:34.100 --> 0:15:37.270

P4:
I don't know so much the data being simplified as it was. Just maybe taking a little time off of me spending in the room.
0:15:45.660 --> 0:15:51.820

Moderator:
Have you noticed a decrease or increase in the notifications that you received about clinical reminders?
0:15:55.30 --> 0:15:56.770

P4:
Yeah, I'm not sure of actually.
0:16:1.400 --> 0:16:7.260

Moderator:
Is it because you think it was just such a small difference or because?
0:16:7.570 --> 0:16:13.80

P4:
Well, well, maybe, but our teams really, really good about making sure all the notifications are done.
So we've never really had an issue on our team with reminders not being completed.
0:16:23.850 --> 0:16:27.820

Moderator:
And would you agree or disagree with this following statement? Overall clinical reminder burden has been reduced by implementing the BHL screening tool.
0:16:37.800 --> 0:16:38.220

P4:
Slightly.
0:16:39.960 --> 0:16:41.980

Moderator:
How much would you estimate?
0:16:43.230 --> 0:16:47.980

P4:
Well, sometimes these [Veterans] will only answer one question. Sometimes I'll answer all four and I think there was a problem with the veterans getting this and not knowing what it was. They thought that it was spam. And a lot of them were really hesitant about doing it. So they would come in the room and then ask me is this something you guys sent? And I was like, well, yeah, it is part of the A. So I think it's it was just a matter of them not being notified correctly that it was going to occur. Or we have the issue too of veterans getting mail and not reading it. So if there was something sent, they kind of just throw stuff away. So that was a big issue.
0:17:34.400 --> 0:17:39.650

Moderator:
So did you send out letters to veterans before the screenings?
0:17:38.250 --> 0:17:41.550

P4:
We were not told to send anything out to our team. I was told that something was being sent out nationally. So I don't know if they did receive it or if they didn't look at it or you know.
0:17:56.430 --> 0:18:0.80

Moderator:
OK, So what do you recommend? Anything to help prevent that from occurring again, to ease veterans.
0:18:7.470 --> 0:18:9.410

P4:
I think more advertisement about it.
0:18:11.640 --> 0:18:15.660

Moderator:
And it's in terms of in what modality would you say?
0:18:15.530 --> 0:18:22.580

P4:
Maybe in the facilities because of veterans are in and out of here all the time going to specialty clinics wherever it may be. If they start to see it, then maybe they would or a little pamphlets or something to notify them of it. Or a mass email to you. The veterans that have emails, or maybe put it on the VA national website.
0:17:34.400 --> 0:17:39.650

Moderator:

0:17:38.250 --> 0:17:41.550

0:19:30.70 --> 0:19:35.790

Moderator:
Then the notification just notifying them that they will be receiving these screening.
0:19:36.740 --> 0:19:37.60

P4:
Right.
0:19:38.440 --> 0:19:42.360

Moderator:
How could be BHL be improved or changed in your opinion?
0:19:43.790 --> 0:19:55.60

P4:
I think just maybe adding more of the questions that we do, I mean we there are so many notifications or notifications. [I could spend ] 20 minutes with [asking just the reminders].
0:20:9.300 --> 0:20:11.950

P4:
See if the veterans just come on time. We always put on the letter. Could you come 15 minutes prior to your appointment time? But that doesn't happen a whole lot.
0:20:19.470 --> 0:20:24.560

Moderator:
So the whole the extra 20 minutes would be at actually asking the clinical reminders.
0:20:25.100 --> 0:20:25.500

P4:
Oh yeah.
0:20:27.320 --> 0:20:31.40

P4:
Or maybe I keep saying get rid of some of them.
0:20:32.500 --> 0:20:34.280

Moderator:
Which ones would you get rid of if you?
0:20:34.410 --> 0:20:35.640

P4:
Like, how do you learn?
0:20:36.110 --> 0:20:42.220

P4:
Like the majority of veterans and the majority of people on Earth learn from all kinds of different ways.
They don't learn specifically on one. They learn by, you know, watching, reading, listening, everybody does. So I think that kind that question the majority of my veterans are like I learned through all those you know. So I just think that question is kind of like null and void at this point.
0:21:4.670 --> 0:21:17.260

Moderator:
OK, so were your workflows affected either positively or negatively using BHL and how-I know you covered this a little bit before. 
0:21:17.750 --> 0:21:29.990

P4:
I mean, I think I'm going to neutral stage right now just because I have to do, which is really easy to go in there and do a BHL and get everybody for the week that takes me like 2 minutes maybe. And like I said, on average it might be saving Me 2 minutes in a room. So it actually. So it it's kind of like even out I guess at this point, yeah.
0:21:40.340 --> 0:21:46.860

Moderator:
OK, at this point but so but if you added more clinical reminders, do you think that?
 0:21:46.830 --> 0:21:53.210

P4:
It would save me a whole lot more time and it would be very beneficial if there was way more questions on there.
0:21:54.500 --> 0:21:55.480

Moderator:
That's great feedback. Thank you, Redacted PII.
0:21:57.600 --> 0:22:3.250

Moderator:
So I also do you feel that the tool maintains an appropriate level of safety?

0:22:5.570 --> 0:22:6.460
P4:
I think so.
0:22:3.260 --> 0:22:7.290

Moderator:
And integrity in comparison. Yes.
0:22:6.920 --> 0:22:7.880

P4:
Yeah, I think so.
0:22:7.300 --> 0:22:9.370

Moderator:
OK, right.
0:22:9.960 --> 0:22:15.10

Moderator:
If you could change one thing about BHL, what would it be? And you may have already answered this.
0:22:17.350 --> 0:22:20.850

P4:
 Yeah, that's basically just adding more questions to save more time.
0:22:23.360 --> 0:22:33.820

Moderator:
So do you think you'll be able to contrast these next questions by using BHL contrasting with E screening?
0:22:33.830 --> 0:22:39.270

Moderator:
Do you think you'll remember, like, whether your data entry was more simplified with The BHL versus EScreening?
0:22:43.340 --> 0:22:45.440

P4:
Uh, yeah, yeah, it was definitely.
0:22:46.300 --> 0:22:48.150

Moderator:
Can you elaborate more on that please?
0:22:49.560 --> 0:23:3.390
P4:
The escreening took more effort in preparing to send it out and then you would have to go in there and click on the person's name to get that put into the notifications. Whereas BHL just automatically does it; they send you an email to remind you too, because we didn't get any notification with escreening. You had to try to remind yourself and you get caught up in day to day stuff all day and it would you would forget about it. BHL sends you an email to remind you, ‘hey, people, [the Veteran] answered questions go in there and like load them’, which is really nice and it's nice that you can load them all at one time instead of individually.
0:23:38.300 --> 0:23:40.550

Moderator:
Was that the difference in eScreening?
0:23:41.40 --> 0:23:49.180

I think he screening if I can remember, we had to load them individually and then you had to do something else and send them over. It just wasn't user friendly, especially when you're working in a busy office.

Moderator:
So Redacted PII, you mentioned that in in the morning when you load it, it took you just 2 minutes, right roughly to do BHL.
0:24:3.910 --> 0:24:5.600

P4:
It maybe less than that. It would be like I would click on the email, go into BHL out and hit upload and it would upload them all. It was very simple.
0:24:13.690 --> 0:24:17.250

Moderator:
Do you remember how long it took you for the E screening to do that process?
0:24:18.160 --> 0:24:19.10

P4:
OH was longer. It was definitely longer than BHL. I don't remember how long, but it took more of an effort.
0:24:25.880 --> 0:24:28.900

Moderator:
Would you say it was considerably longer if you can?
0:24:32.100 --> 0:24:33.880

P4:
Yeah, it might have been a couple minutes. BHL might be like 30 seconds.
0:24:38.660 --> 0:24:46.720

Moderator:
Did you notice an increase or decrease in notifications with the Escreening in comparison to BHL?
0:24:47.630 --> 0:24:47.900
P4:
No. The Screening the veteran's Harley did it all because it was email. There was no text messages. So we wouldn't get very many responses with Escreen. Everybody has a cell phone nowadays. They live on them, so that's the best. A text message is the best way.

0:25:12.970 --> 0:25:18.40
Moderator:
So you think you would have gotten a better response rate with a text message?
0:25:18.800 --> 0:25:19.680

P4:
Maybe yeah.
0:25:28.680 --> 0:25:33.150
Moderator:
And I think you've answered the some of these questions indirectly.
0:25:34.300 --> 0:25:34.540

P4:
Yeah.
0:25:35.120 --> 0:25:36.170

Moderator:
How can we?
0:25:36.340 --> 0:25:42.570

Moderator:
How could you, if you could improve these screening, how could you improve it?
It versus BHL?
0:25:45.270 --> 0:25:47.850

P4:
Same answer, just more notifications.
0:25:49.0 --> 0:25:49.850
Moderator:
Notifications.
0:25:49.780 --> 0:25:50.20

P4:
Yeah.
0:25:51.100 --> 0:25:59.680

Moderator:
And lastly, if you had a choice in which tool you would implement nationwide, which of the two would you choose and why?
0:26:0.800 --> 0:26:3.120

P4:
The BHL, hands down, it's just simpler.
0:26:2.590 --> 0:26:5.390
Moderator:
OK, simpler and.
0:26:4.950 --> 0:26:6.620

P4:
It's less time consuming.
0:26:8.260 --> 0:26:8.580

Moderator:
OK.
0:26:10.260 --> 0:26:10.890

Moderator:
OK.
0:26:11.10 --> 0:26:12.630

Moderator:
That's it for my questions today.
0:26:12.640 --> 0:26:15.950

Moderator:
Redacted PII, do you have any follow up questions that you'd like to ask?
0:26:18.770 --> 0:26:19.540

Observer 1
I don't.
0:26:19.590 --> 0:26:22.660

Observer 1
I just like to say thank you for taking the extra half hour.
