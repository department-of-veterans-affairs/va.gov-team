Moderator:
Alright, that's that's fine.
0:1:17.860 --> 0:1:21.770

0:1:23.820 --> 0:1:24.110

P20:
OK.
0:1:24.120 --> 0:1:24.410

Can it?
0:1:28.240 --> 0:1:29.400

Moderator:
Exactly, yes.
0:1:24.450 --> 0:1:30.310


P20:
So kind of the the way I was brought on or OK, alright.
0:1:30.420 --> 0:1:36.580

P20:
I was asked to be as the one of the cats I was asked to be part of the pilot.
0:1:38.570 --> 0:1:43.550

P20:
Because they they've done one the first half of it and they were switching tools.
0:1:44.310 --> 0:1:51.260

P20:
And so I was asked to be the the cat representative to kind of set up the get everything set up in.
0:1:53.720 --> 0:1:56.630

P20:
And CPRS and for the screening tools?
0:1:59.250 --> 0:1:59.990

P20:
For our facility.
0:2:2.50 --> 0:2:2.490

Moderator:
OK.
0:2:1.830 --> 0:2:2.860

P20:
And so I was.
0:2:3.30 --> 0:2:5.380
P20:
I was given the list of.
0:2:7.820 --> 0:2:17.910

P20:
List of the the nurses, the nurses and nurse managers that were involved in the pilot, and I went through and made sure that each of them hadn't had an account set up.
0:2:18.900 --> 0:2:38.750

P20:
And then the screening tools were uploaded, I believe by John, but they're they were uploaded by somebody else and then I went through and made sure that each each person was assigned or assigned and had availability to get to the the screening tools that they were using.
0:2:39.620 --> 0:2:40.170
Moderator:
OK.
0:2:41.20 --> 0:2:48.690

Moderator:
Can you summarize the training portion that was provided for you on the screening tool during the onboarding process?
0:2:49.280 --> 0:3:2.520

P20:
It's the the training that I ended up using was the online online recorded sessions I to time to be to act as the administrator.
0:3:3.510 --> 0:3:3.920

Moderator:
OK.
0:3:3.930 --> 0:3:6.950
Moderator:
And how long were those online recording sessions for?
0:3:7.190 --> 0:3:7.850

P20:
Ohh.
0:3:10.480 --> 0:3:11.370
P20:
I'm thinking totally.
0:3:11.380 --> 0:3:12.810

P20:
I was like an hour or two hours.
0:3:13.810 --> 0:3:14.190

Moderator:
OK.
0:3:14.200 --> 0:3:14.860

Moderator:
And did you?
0:3:14.910 --> 0:3:19.620

Moderator:
Did you watch them in one session or did you have several sessions?
0:3:19.630 --> 0:3:21.210

Moderator:
How how did you go about?
0:3:20.380 --> 0:3:28.660
P20:
I think I think I if I, if I remember correctly, I think there was two of them that I watched and I ended up watching them in two different two different times.
0:3:29.470 --> 0:3:35.860

Moderator:
OK, so after watching them, how long did it take you to learn how to to configure the tool?
0:3:37.170 --> 0:3:43.980
P20:
Ah, probably probably about 15 minutes of just work actually working around in the tool.
0:3:46.280 --> 0:3:46.440

P20:
So.
0:3:51.580 --> 0:3:51.760

P20:
Yeah.
0:3:44.790 --> 0:4:0.860

Moderator:
OK, so so you actually use the tool after you watch the training in order to learn OK, on a scale of one to five, with one being very easy and five being very difficult.
0:4:1.120 --> 0:4:4.230

Moderator:
How easy or difficult was it to learn?
0:4:4.240 --> 0:4:6.360

Moderator:
How did you configure the tool? The?
0:4:8.270 --> 0:4:8.730

P20:
Umm.
0:4:15.270 --> 0:4:16.720

Moderator:
2 1/2 and why could?
0:4:11.80 --> 0:4:27.820

P20:
Probably I'd say about a, a I'd say about 2 1/2 yeah, because it was what's kind of once I once I understood or kind of got understood the way that it worked, it was real easy from that point on.
0:4:28.720 --> 0:4:28.900

Moderator:
OK.
0:4:28.650 --> 0:4:35.850

P20:
Who is a little bit little bit of a learning curve kind of putting the the pieces that were outside of my view.
0:4:36.600 --> 0:4:45.530

P20:
Uh, you know, like the the screening tools, which the kind of is the the tools themselves were set up.
0:4:46.280 --> 0:4:51.260

P20:
Uh, we're set up and uploaded into the system and then I would assign them to the users.
0:4:52.350 --> 0:4:52.650

Moderator:
OK.
0:4:52.700 --> 0:4:54.760

P20:
The kind of kind of once I once I figured out.
0:4:54.770 --> 0:5:0.430

P20:
OK, the little pieces because it was when I first started working with it.
0:5:0.550 --> 0:5:7.910

P20:
Uh, the I was able to set up the the people, the accounts, but the tools hadn't.
0:5:7.990 --> 0:5:30.160

P20:
The actual tools that they were using hadn't been uploaded yet, and so when I came back, as you know, came back little bit later, I saw OK here they were and then got through and was able to sign him to the nurses and make sure like that, like the nurse managers had the were given.
0:5:30.610 --> 0:5:32.360

P20:
I gave them a higher level of of.
0:5:35.740 --> 0:5:42.300

P20:
Account so that way they could, if they needed to make some changes or do things for their people that they could.
0:5:43.480 --> 0:5:44.30

Moderator:
OK.
0:5:44.600 --> 0:5:46.600

Moderator:
Could you tell me what it means to?
0:5:51.540 --> 0:5:51.760

P20:
Yeah.
0:5:48.510 --> 0:5:52.890

Moderator:
You, you said uploading the tools you said you weren't, could you?
0:5:52.900 --> 0:5:56.40

Moderator:
Could you provide more detail on that a little bit?
0:5:57.860 --> 0:5:58.170

P20:
OK.
0:5:58.180 --> 0:5:58.390

P20:
Yeah.
0:5:58.400 --> 0:6:0.680

P20:
The kind of the I think the actual.
0:6:7.720 --> 0:6:7.900
Moderator:
Yeah.
0:6:3.970 --> 0:6:11.940

P20:
Questionnaires that were sent out to the to the veterans, those those were all created by somebody else.
0:6:12.850 --> 0:6:13.190

Moderator:
OK.
0:6:21.920 --> 0:6:22.610

Moderator:
So when you say.
0:6:13.590 --> 0:6:23.130

P20:
And then and kind of put into the system and then I could assign them to the nurses to to be able to have access to the tools, to the, to those.
0:6:23.640 --> 0:6:24.780

P20:
Yeah, to those questionnaires.
0:6:25.260 --> 0:6:28.870

Moderator:
So when you say, put them in the system, what does that mean?
0:6:29.0 --> 0:6:30.150

Moderator:
Could you explain that to me?
0:6:33.240 --> 0:6:41.0

P20:
I'm not sure exactly how how they did it, but they they made it so that that the questionnaires were available to be assigned.
0:6:41.940 --> 0:6:44.730

Moderator:
OK, so where did you retrieve them from?
0:6:45.460 --> 0:7:11.520

P20:
I they actually kind of showed up in the when I go into the accounts, when I go into the nurse account or that, you know, the count for that nurse, I would have, I could, I could pull up a list of all the available screening tools or questionnaires and then I could assign them, you know, give them a sign up so that they were visible or available to to that nurse.
0:7:12.170 --> 0:7:12.660

Moderator:
OK.
0:7:12.910 --> 0:7:13.840

Moderator:
OK, great.
0:7:14.60 --> 0:7:16.440

Moderator:
I'm going back to the onboarding.

0:7:16.650 --> 0:7:24.190

Moderator:
If you could change one thing about your onboarding or the training that you received, what would it be?
0:7:26.710 --> 0:7:27.50

P20:
Umm.
0:7:34.820 --> 0:7:36.320

P20:
I think if I could change one thing.
0:7:39.70 --> 0:7:49.550

P20:
And probably it probably give a little bit of time with me being being able to work with uh, work with somebody that, yeah, I said use the system, but kind of.
0:7:51.600 --> 0:7:53.550

P20:
To help kind of point me.
0:7:53.560 --> 0:7:56.980

P20:
OK, here's where this is, and here's hi.
0:7:57.960 --> 0:7:58.890

P20:
You know, here's the tools.
0:7:58.900 --> 0:8:0.80

P20:
Here's how the tools are created.
0:8:1.620 --> 0:8:3.890

P20:
Uh, you know, here's other questions are created.
0:8:3.900 --> 0:8:5.470

P20:
Here's how we're uploading them.
0:8:5.480 --> 0:8:6.30

P20:
Here's how they're.
0:8:15.880 --> 0:8:16.470

P20:
Yeah.
0:8:16.520 --> 0:8:18.330

P20:
Yeah, because it's just. It happened.
0:8:9.310 --> 0:8:18.360

Moderator:
OK, so like are you referring to you'd prefer something in real time versus recorded or is is that what you?
0:8:18.340 --> 0:8:18.720
P20:
H
appened.

0:8:18.760 --> 0:8:20.790
P20:
Yeah, it happened that I wasn't.
0:8:20.840 --> 0:8:22.640

P20:
I wasn't available at the times that were.
0:8:23.270 --> 0:8:26.840

P20:
Uh, that it was occurring, that the training was occurring live.
0:8:27.760 --> 0:8:28.190

Moderator:
OK.
0:8:28.240 --> 0:8:30.930
Moderator:
So yes, so the training was occurring live.
0:8:37.570 --> 0:8:37.890

Moderator:
OK.
0:8:31.800 --> 0:8:37.920

P20:
Yeah, I think there was a couple of training sessions, but none of them worked out with my schedule at the time.
0:8:39.140 --> 0:8:39.750

Moderator:
And did you?
0:8:40.60 --> 0:8:44.330

Moderator:
Did you contact any one while you were going through the onboarding?
0:8:44.520 --> 0:8:50.800

Moderator:
Did you contact anyone to to answer any questions or anything that you were stuck on?
0:8:53.10 --> 0:8:54.10

P20:
Ah, no, I hadn't.
0:8:54.240 --> 0:8:54.660

P20:
No, I didn't.
0:8:54.720 --> 0:8:54.930

Moderator:
No.
0:8:55.880 --> 0:9:0.800

Moderator:
So you were able to troubleshoot everything with just the videos that were assigned to you.
0:9:1.200 --> 0:9:1.960
P20:

Yeah, yeah.
0:9:2.620 --> 0:9:4.740

Moderator:
OK, alright.
0:9:5.110 --> 0:9:12.690

Moderator:
So I guess I'm going back to configuring the the tools.
0:9:13.680 --> 0:9:19.550

Moderator:
So you you had mentioned you were you created user accounts for the nurses, right?
0:9:19.180 --> 0:9:19.960

P20:
Yeah. Yep.
0:9:19.680 --> 0:9:21.350

Moderator:
And and the and then you.
0:9:21.400 --> 0:9:26.80

Moderator:
So for the typical for, for for nurses, you just.
0:9:40.40 --> 0:9:40.430

P20:
Questions.
0:9:40.440 --> 0:9:40.890

P20:
Yeah.
0:9:41.200 --> 0:9:43.640

P20:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
0:9:28.710 --> 0:9:44.340

Moderator:
Set up just standard accounts and you gave more more, I guess administrative type of not power but more access to the nurse managers, right. I.
0:9:43.650 --> 0:9:52.610

P20:
I think there was two or three nurse managers that that I gave kind of that next that next level permissions to.
0:9:53.940 --> 0:9:54.220

Moderator:
OK.
0:9:57.560 --> 0:9:59.910

Moderator:
So can you?
0:10:0.240 --> 0:10:1.90

Moderator:
Let's see.
0:10:1.470 --> 0:10:2.310

Moderator:
So how is that?
0:10:6.650 --> 0:10:6.880

Moderator:
Right.
0:10:6.890 --> 0:10:10.470

Moderator:
So So what steps were easy in that whole process in that?
0:10:12.530 --> 0:10:15.230

Moderator:
Assigning the user accounts what was easy.
0:10:16.780 --> 0:10:20.880

P20:
It's kind of once I got into the kind of the program and worked with little bit.
0:10:21.510 --> 0:10:27.350

P20:
Uh, it was actually pretty easy to to assign the assign the different roles in the system.
0:10:28.640 --> 0:10:28.860

Moderator:
OK.
0:10:29.640 --> 0:10:34.560

P20:
They are the the account setups were actually pretty easy to to do.
0:10:33.300 --> 0:10:40.440
Moderator:
OK, so did you, did you run into any challenges at that point at if any, no?
0:10:38.980 --> 0:10:40.750
P20:
Uh, no, no, not really.
0:10:40.810 --> 0:10:45.760

P20:
They yeah, I was able to pretty much go through and set up all the, get all the accounts setup for the nurses.
0:10:46.770 --> 0:10:55.760

P20:
Uh, they probably within for I spent maybe an hour total from start to finish getting out, getting the account set up.
0:10:56.970 --> 0:10:57.470

Moderator:
OK.
0:10:58.170 --> 0:11:10.610

Moderator:
And can you please go over the steps again and adding the reminders if you could go through that if you can summarize the steps in details again.
0:11:10.80 --> 0:11:12.150
.
P20:
They're kind of the yeah, kind of the steps.
0:11:12.200 --> 0:11:14.290

P20:
Steps where I'd set up the accounts.
0:11:16.870 --> 0:11:18.340

P20:
In a second, let me get back to you here.
0:11:18.350 --> 0:11:22.10

P20:
Sorry, another screen popped Doctor, so ah.
0:11:23.430 --> 0:11:24.500

P20:
Kind of I once.

0:11:24.510 --> 0:11:39.90
P20:
Once I got the account, the account set up, then I would go in and kind of ah load in the different clinics that were that were available to be assigned in the system.
0:11:40.180 --> 0:11:48.810

P20:
And then I would go to go to each nurse, you know, each nurse and I would assign them the the screening tools that were appropriate to them.
0:11:49.990 --> 0:11:50.270
Moderator:
OK.
0:11:50.0 --> 0:12:2.270

P20:
And I think we just had, I think we said one or two areas, so that promised that they counts that I'd set up all had the same team sets of screening tools available to them.
0:12:4.10 --> 0:12:5.960
Moderator:
And how many did you load?
0:12:6.50 --> 0:12:6.720

Moderator:
Do you remember?
0:12:11.460 --> 0:12:13.480

Moderator:
Yes, the screening tools, I'm sorry.
0:12:8.570 --> 0:12:15.270

P20:
Uh, as far as screening tools or I that's OK. Uh.
0:12:20.300 --> 0:12:22.760

P20:
I think there were like 5 or 6 screening tools that.
0:12:25.110 --> 0:12:26.230

P20:
That I set up for the nurses.
0:12:27.260 --> 0:12:27.660

Moderator:
OK.
0:12:30.500 --> 0:12:31.550

Moderator:
If you can.
0:12:32.600 --> 0:12:37.290

Moderator:

0:12:38.820 --> 0:12:42.760

P20:
Uh, no, not really. Tell.
0:12:41.660 --> 0:12:46.490

0:12:46.680 --> 0:12:47.590

Moderator:

0:12:47.600 --> 0:12:49.420

Moderator:
Either positively or negatively.
0:12:53.180 --> 0:12:54.750

P20:
Uh, there was.
0:12:55.610 --> 0:12:56.320

P20:
There wasn't actually.
0:12:56.330 --> 0:12:59.220

P20:
That is from for my piece of it, there wasn't a lot of.
0:13:1.720 --> 0:13:7.900

P20:
Wasn't a big time consuming or you know, time constraints, I say constraints but didn't take a lot of time it was.
0:13:10.330 --> 0:13:16.430

P20:
Something I was kind of, they're able to take care of and get set up or, you know, do my piece.
0:13:17.860 --> 0:13:19.590

P20:
It's still within the same within.
0:13:21.540 --> 0:13:23.200

P20:
All my you know, within my regular duties.
0:13:24.280 --> 0:13:25.10

Moderator:
OK.
0:13:25.160 --> 0:13:30.130

Moderator:
And so did you just do this at the beginning of the pilot or did you do this?
0:13:30.200 --> 0:13:32.210

Moderator:
Did you set this up on a weekly?
0:13:32.260 --> 0:13:35.660

Moderator:
Did you have to do any administration on a weekly basis?
0:13:36.650 --> 0:13:39.200
P20:
No, it was pretty much set up.
0:13:39.710 --> 0:13:43.710
P20:
Probably the first two probably a week or two.
0:13:44.550 --> 0:14:9.330

P20:
Once we get everything set up and uh, I think throughout the why we're doing the pilot, I think there was once or twice that I believe they added a couple clinics in and it was probably 5 minutes go in, make sure that that that I updated this that I you know did a download of the of clinics again to just add that clinic in.
0:14:10.240 --> 0:14:10.830
Moderator:
OK.
0:14:11.380 --> 0:14:15.470

Moderator:
Initially, so the for the first few, then initial setup.
0:14:15.700 --> 0:14:18.460

Moderator:
How long did each step take you the initial setup?
0:14:19.130 --> 0:14:19.670
P20:
Umm.
0:14:19.990 --> 0:14:22.280

P20:
Preacher's for each nurse account.
0:14:22.830 --> 0:14:35.460

P20:
Let's say for each nurse account to set up the account and to assign them the tools was probably maybe 5 minutes for each nurse, if that, yeah.
0:14:34.30 --> 0:14:36.940

Moderator:
For each nurse and how many nurses total?
0:14:36.950 --> 0:14:41.90

Moderator:
I know you mentioned two or three nurse managers, right? But.
0:14:41.90 --> 0:14:42.490

P20:
Yeah, I think, yeah.
0:14:42.570 --> 0:14:44.100

P20:
For nurses, I think they were.
0:14:47.920 --> 0:14:52.30

P20:
I'm thinking I had a list of maybe like 15 or 20, yeah.
0:14:50.820 --> 0:14:52.50

Moderator:
15, OK.
0:14:52.110 --> 0:14:56.990

Moderator:
So, so would you say 15 or 20 * 5 minutes?
0:14:57.260 --> 0:14:59.960

Moderator:
Would that be a fair assessment and the time it took?
0:15:1.80 --> 0:15:1.300

P20:
Yeah.
0:15:3.60 --> 0:15:3.360

Moderator:
OK.
0:15:4.550 --> 0:15:8.390

Moderator:
And did the the nurse managers that that that their accounts take longer?
0:15:9.610 --> 0:15:13.140

P20:
Uh, no, there are actually took the same amount of time.
0:15:13.860 --> 0:15:14.180

Moderator:
OK.
0:15:13.630 --> 0:15:18.190

P20:
It was just a case of setting a different permission level on the drop down box is all.
0:15:19.20 --> 0:15:19.340

Moderator:
OK.
0:15:21.30 --> 0:15:28.480

Moderator:
If if you could change one thing, either about configuring the tool or the administration of the tool, what would it be?
0:15:33.120 --> 0:15:41.510

P20:
Umm I could change one thing it it uh seemed like when I was uploading or you know, done.
0:15:43.410 --> 0:15:45.570

P20:
Getting the clinics downloaded into the system.
0:15:46.600 --> 0:15:54.710

P20:
Uh, that problem that seemed that that probably took the most amount of time and that was just waiting time for it to communicate back and forth.
0:15:55.680 --> 0:15:58.990

Moderator:
Could you explain a little bit more in detail what that means?
0:15:59.450 --> 0:16:0.180

P20:
It's uh.
0:15:59.600 --> 0:16:0.700

Moderator:
Like what did it entail?
0:16:2.280 --> 0:16:3.590

P20:
It entailed I'd be going.
0:16:3.600 --> 0:16:14.490

P20:
I go into the settings and basically just click it, you know, click on a button to tell it to to go out and pull in the clinics.
0:16:15.570 --> 0:16:15.880

Moderator:
OK.
0:16:15.630 --> 0:16:16.610

P20:
Well, inelastic clinics.
0:16:19.470 --> 0:16:19.980

P20:
Uh.
0:16:15.890 --> 0:16:24.670

Moderator:
So when you say settings and what tool were you so, so the Screener tool or other tools that you were using other?
0:16:23.920 --> 0:16:26.190

P20:
The the the administrative tools.
0:16:26.900 --> 0:16:27.200

Moderator:
OK.
0:16:28.950 --> 0:16:31.890

P20:
So if you would when the same one that I set up the accounts in.
0:16:32.490 --> 0:16:32.770

Moderator:
OK.
0:16:34.240 --> 0:16:34.620

Moderator:
All right.
0:16:38.80 --> 0:16:48.80

Moderator:
So lastly, if you had a choice in implementing this tool nationwide versus not implementing any tool, which would you choose and why?
0:16:52.110 --> 0:17:20.140

P20:
Umm, it's from kind of my understanding and kind of what I saw on my end was I would say that it that it's something that would be very that is was very useful it it it allowed the nurses to kind of get some of the some of the preliminary screening that we do every you know every year, every regularly availability to to get that out to the to the veteran.
0:17:20.150 --> 0:17:26.840

P20:
So the veteran would have the opportunity to kind of fill that stuff out and then they could get it back.
0:17:26.970 --> 0:17:28.160

P20:
Take a look at it and see.
0:17:28.170 --> 0:17:28.550

P20:
OK.
0:17:28.560 --> 0:17:29.580

P20:
You know, is it?
0:17:29.590 --> 0:17:30.870

P20:
Yep, everything looks OK.
0:17:34.180 --> 0:17:34.460

Moderator:
OK.
0:17:38.620 --> 0:17:39.220

Moderator:
Great, Steven.
0:17:39.230 --> 0:17:39.580

Moderator:
So.
0:17:34.230 --> 0:17:39.660

P20:
Or or is it something that needed needed more follow up on so.
0:17:39.650 --> 0:17:51.70

Moderator:
So that's that's great that you you have you got some feedback from the nurses, umm it it was there any other staff members that you got feedback and how how did the feedback come about?
0:17:51.620 --> 0:17:52.70

P20:
Uh.
0:17:52.80 --> 0:17:56.740

P20:
Kind of the feedback that I heard was, uh, I attended the kind of the weekly check in meetings.
0:17:57.530 --> 0:17:57.970

Moderator:
OK.
0:17:57.950 --> 0:18:2.20

P20:
Ah, and just kind of hearing that hearing them report back.
0:18:2.110 --> 0:18:2.320

P20:

0:18:2.330 --> 0:18:7.360

P20:

0:18:7.370 --> 0:18:9.920

P20:
Yeah, we're getting the getting the results.
0:18:10.30 --> 0:18:16.150

P20:
You know the the questionnaires back and seemed to be and able to process them.
0:18:17.200 --> 0:18:17.460

Moderator:
OK.
0:18:17.0 --> 0:18:20.260

P20:
That sounds like they didn't have any issues on their end of things.
0:18:21.220 --> 0:18:25.360

Moderator:
They said, who attended the weekly sessions beside your yourself and the nurses.
0:18:27.600 --> 0:18:28.440

P20:
The nurse says I didn't.
0:18:28.480 --> 0:18:29.970

P20:
John was, I think usually there.
0:18:30.710 --> 0:18:30.970

Moderator:
OK.
0:18:31.420 --> 0:18:31.950

P20:
I.
0:18:34.280 --> 0:18:35.720

P20:
And not sure what I'm trying to think of.
0:18:35.730 --> 0:18:36.270

P20:
Who else was there?
0:18:38.50 --> 0:18:38.450

P20:
Ah.
0:18:41.400 --> 0:18:46.590

Moderator:
So so from what you've heard during the weekly check in sessions.
0:18:48.820 --> 0:19:1.850

Moderator:
Uh, did the nurses or nurse managers express whether the tool was a positive addition to their workflow, or was it negative in some aspects?
0:19:1.980 --> 0:19:4.740

Moderator:
Was there any negative acts aspects to it?
0:19:5.250 --> 0:19:6.880

P20:
Uh, you know, I didn't.
0:19:6.930 --> 0:19:8.900

P20:
I didn't hear any complaints about that.
0:19:9.50 --> 0:19:11.960

P20:
The system wasn't working or that there was issues with it.
0:19:12.790 --> 0:19:13.220

P20:
Huh.
0:19:14.420 --> 0:19:15.210

P20:
Same everything.
0:19:15.340 --> 0:19:23.280

P20:
See kind of the the feedback that I that I heard was that things were that it was working the way it was supposed to and.
0:19:25.720 --> 0:19:28.640

P20:
They were able to to use the tool effectively.
0:19:29.620 --> 0:19:30.350

Moderator:
OK.
0:19:30.460 --> 0:19:31.540

Moderator:
When was the last?
0:19:31.550 --> 0:19:38.250

Moderator:
So can you do you remember the dates you started with the tool and the dates you ended with?
0:19:38.860 --> 0:19:42.710

Moderator:
You know the the the your last day of administrating the tool.
0:19:44.280 --> 0:19:44.890
P20:
Uh.
0:19:42.720 --> 0:19:45.380

Moderator:
To remember the dates roughly.
0:19:48.170 --> 0:19:55.720
P20:
I'm thinking you we started like, I keep thinking like the beginning of January is when I first got involved.
0:19:57.210 --> 0:20:6.350

P20:
Ah, and I know we are having the the weekly meetings up until I think about let's say I was gone last week, but like 2 weeks before that, I think we had.
0:20:7.420 --> 0:20:9.280
P20:
So I had a meeting and we're kind of wrapping things up.
0:20:10.400 --> 0:20:11.710

0:20:14.640 --> 0:20:14.960

Moderator:

Moderator:
OK.
0:20:20.290 --> 0:20:33.330

Moderator:
So from our understanding that the pilots was to end on April 12th, do you know if if for some reason the pilot ended early or not in your facility?
0:20:35.0 --> 0:20:37.490

P20:
You know what I that I'm not sure of.
0:20:37.660 --> 0:20:38.190
