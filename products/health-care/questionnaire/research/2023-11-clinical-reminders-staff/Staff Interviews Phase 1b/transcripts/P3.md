0:0:0.0 --> 0:0:0.780

P3:
Yes, I am.
0:0:1.860 --> 0:0:2.420

Moderator
Thank you.
0:0:4.980 --> 0:0:5.920

Moderator
OK so.
0:0:9.410 --> 0:0:10.520

Moderator
And you tell me.
0:0:10.810 --> 0:0:16.10

Moderator
It just for the regular to how you were involved in the clinical reminders pilot.
0:0:17.940 --> 0:0:24.460

P3:
So our our primary care team was part of the pilot for the clinical reminders.

0:0:24.920 --> 0:0:43.40
P3:
And as far as my responsibilities and that I would send out the screenings every week to the veterans, and then we get email alerted that they've responded to the reminders and then we would save them into their chart.
0:0:44.640 --> 0:0:46.750

P3:
And that was pretty much.
0:0:50.110 --> 0:0:51.580
Moderator
OK. Uh.
0:0:48.770 --> 0:0:53.270

P3:
My involvement building the screenings weekly, sending them out.
0:0:53.940 --> 0:0:54.550
Moderator
OK.
0:0:54.870 --> 0:1:2.870

Moderator
And and so just to confirm, you use the E screening tool 1st and then you use the BHO after.
0:1:2.120 --> 0:1:3.380

P3:
Yes, yes.
0:1:3.400 --> 0:1:4.170

Moderator
OK.
0:1:4.480 --> 0:1:10.200

Moderator
So were you involved in the in both parts of the pilots the same way?
0:1:10.930 --> 0:1:11.50

P3:
Yes.
0:1:12.0 --> 0:1:12.590

Moderator
OK.
0:1:13.560 --> 0:1:20.70

Moderator
So can you describe your onboarding process with the second tool being BHL?
0:1:22.290 --> 0:1:25.500

P3:
Umm, we had the as far as onboarding.
0:1:25.510 --> 0:1:30.280

P3:
We had like a A teams meeting where we all got together.
0:1:31.990 --> 0:1:34.930

P3:
You know, like this on zoom and discussed.

0:1:37.140 --> 0:1:41.600

P3:
You know the pilot as far as the on boarding, there was a brief.
0:1:43.260 --> 0:1:54.620

P3:
I'm trying to remember that was so long ago, I think he pretty much walked us through what we needed to do, shared his screen and it was very simple to pick it up from there.
0:1:54.630 --> 0:2:0.210

P3:
I think there were more training tools available if you need it and he said to reach out.
0:2:0.970 --> 0:2:4.940

P3:
We always had weekly meetings scheduled.
0:2:4.950 --> 0:2:9.450

P3:
We could join in if we felt necessary to ask any questions at any time.
0:2:9.460 --> 0:2:22.90

P3:
That was always available through the teams chat, but there wasn't really a a big need for umm, you know, training once we had already done the first one.
0:2:22.130 --> 0:2:23.610

P3:
The second one came very easy.
0:2:24.590 --> 0:2:25.0
Moderator
OK.
0:2:25.10 --> 0:2:33.490
Moderator
So you mentioned that you could get more trainings if needed with those live trainings or are they prerecorded like video trainings?
0:2:34.520 --> 0:2:47.920

P3:
I I think they were recorded trainings but I'm not sure I I honestly it's been a while since he mentioned, you know if you needed more training to reach out through the the teams chat.
0:2:48.330 --> 0:2:50.380
Moderator
OK, excellent.
0:2:50.780 --> 0:2:50.980

P3:
Yeah.
0:2:50.390 --> 0:2:55.20

Moderator
Redacted, do you remember how long it took you to learn the second tool?
0:2:55.30 --> 0:2:55.830

Moderator
The BHO?
0:2:56.220 --> 0:2:57.290

P3:
I mean, it was.
0:2:57.300 --> 0:2:58.610

P3:
It was within minutes.
0:2:58.620 --> 0:3:2.990

P3:
Probably it was very simple like I said because it was the second one.
0:3:3.900 --> 0:3:4.240

Moderator
OK.
0:3:3.440 --> 0:3:6.920

P3:
Maybe if it was the first one you were starting with, it would take a little more.
0:3:8.650 --> 0:3:9.300

P3:
Training.
0:3:15.530 --> 0:3:16.230

Moderator
What was it?
0:3:9.310 --> 0:3:17.740

P3:
But we kind of knew what was involved just based off of the first one, this one was actually easier.
0:3:17.750 --> 0:3:21.20

P3:
I think you know to build your screenings and everything.
0:3:21.620 --> 0:3:22.50
Moderator
Yeah.
0:3:21.610 --> 0:3:22.570

P3:
Then the first one.
0:3:22.60 --> 0:3:22.620

Moderator
Can you?
0:3:22.850 --> 0:3:24.560

Moderator
Can you tell me about that?
0:3:24.940 --> 0:3:29.990

Moderator
When you say eat more easily, can you elaborate on that?
0:3:31.40 --> 0:3:32.930

P3:
I mean, it was just pretty intuitive.
0:3:33.500 --> 0:3:33.780

Moderator
OK.
0:3:32.940 --> 0:3:40.550

P3:
You just go into the system and then you just had to type in the clinics that you wanted to send the screenings out to.
0:3:41.40 --> 0:3:50.670

P3:
So I would just type in my 3 clinics, save that and so once it was saved originally they were in there for the, you know, they're still in there now.
0:3:50.680 --> 0:4:2.720

P3:
So now when I go in to send I just have to put in the date range of when I want the screenings to go out, send it and I mean it's just yeah, it it really just took minutes to pick up.
0:4:4.50 --> 0:4:4.490
Moderator
OK.
0:4:4.500 --> 0:4:16.170

Moderator
So on a scale of one to five, with one being very easy and five being very difficult, how easy or difficult was it to learn the BHO tool?
0:4:18.400 --> 0:4:24.330

P3:
Going off of it being the second one, I would say it was a one as it was very easy.
0:4:24.590 --> 0:4:28.370

P3:
I don't know if that would be the same answer if it hadn't been my first.
0:4:28.460 --> 0:4:34.730

P3:
You know, if it had been the first one of the two, it may have, maybe have been a three at that point.
0:4:35.960 --> 0:4:39.130

Moderator
Uh, can you talk a little bit about how the?
0:4:41.310 --> 0:4:41.480

Moderator
Uh.
0:4:41.870 --> 0:4:49.50

Moderator
Initial onboarding with the E screening may have differed from the BHL on boarding.
0:4:49.790 --> 0:5:2.480

P3:
Mainly we all got together in person here at our facility and discussed what was gonna be involved with, you know, because this was an entirely new thing for us.
0:5:2.650 --> 0:5:6.540

P3:
And there were just going to be three teams involved in it.
0:5:6.550 --> 0:5:9.20

P3:
So the three teams were brought in together.
0:5:9.30 --> 0:5:10.20

P3:
We discussed it.
0:5:10.30 --> 0:5:14.550

P3:
Some of the concerns and things were voiced out loud.
0:5:14.610 --> 0:5:20.540

P3:
None of that happened the second time because we were already, you know, we were all familiar with what to expect.
0:5:20.550 --> 0:5:28.670

P3:
So really the first time that onboarding was just more of laying out why we were doing this, what was, you know, involved?
0:5:29.520 --> 0:5:34.250
Moderator
So can you distinguish the the training process between the two?
0:5:34.260 --> 0:5:37.240

Moderator
Can you say which one you would prefer over the other?
0:5:39.780 --> 0:5:51.660
P3:
Well, that's hard to do only because I don't feel that we really I I can't even remember if there was training available for the second one because we I didn't need it.
0:5:52.120 --> 0:5:52.420

Moderator
OK.
0:5:51.670 --> 0:5:55.600

P3:
So I didn't pursue getting any additional training.
0:5:55.610 --> 0:5:58.820

P3:
I don't know if anyone else you know did so.
0:6:0.90 --> 0:6:9.120

Moderator
If you could change one thing about the onboarding or training that you received for this tool, the the last tool, what would it be?
0:6:11.340 --> 0:6:11.840

P3:
Umm.
0:6:14.990 --> 0:6:15.930

P3:
There really wasn't.
0:6:15.940 --> 0:6:18.320

P3:
There really wasn't anything that I would change.
0:6:18.390 --> 0:6:22.180

P3:
I mean they it we had the weekly meetings.
0:6:22.190 --> 0:6:29.280

P3:
Like I said that we could join, they were always at lunchtime, that kind of cut into participation.
0:6:40.360 --> 0:6:40.560

Moderator
So.
0:6:29.290 --> 0:6:41.810

P3:
I feel as far as like joining and having, you know, live chat questions answered, having it be during the lunch hour was a little difficult for participation sake.
0:6:45.800 --> 0:6:46.30

P3:
Yes.
0:6:42.530 --> 0:6:46.140

Moderator
So would you have preferred it at a different time and?
0:6:48.70 --> 0:7:1.280

P3:
I mean, I'm sure it was done because they figured that's when everyone has a break from their work, but also a lot of people leave the building and so they're not there sitting at their desk to have a meeting at, you know, 12:30.
0:7:3.650 --> 0:7:4.260

Moderator
OK.
0:7:4.330 --> 0:7:5.20

Moderator
So.
0:7:5.150 --> 0:7:6.360

Moderator
So we're gonna go over.
0:7:6.950 --> 0:7:12.280

Moderator
So what was your overall experience using the BHL 20?
0:7:12.290 --> 0:7:17.780

Moderator
Can you walk me through your final process for sending, receiving and reviewing the questionnaires?
0:7:18.720 --> 0:7:19.570

P3:
Sure, the.
0:7:21.180 --> 0:7:25.990

P3:
So every Friday I would pull up the BHL.
0:7:26.0 --> 0:7:30.870

P3:
I have it saved in my favorites, so it's right there I entered.
0:7:32.490 --> 0:7:41.360

P3:
The clinics that I want to send these screenings for my clinics were already, you know, they'd been built from day one in there.
0:7:41.370 --> 0:7:44.620

P3:
So all I have to do is click on that set of clinics.
0:7:44.630 --> 0:7:46.350

P3:
I don't have to type them in or anything.
0:7:46.360 --> 0:7:47.610

P3:
They're already saved in there.
0:7:48.530 --> 0:7:56.600

P3:
Then I put the date range I want, so I would do Monday through Friday of the following week unless I knew my provider was off for a couple of days.
0:7:56.610 --> 0:8:4.980

P3:
I you know, if he was off Monday and Tuesday, I would send them for Wednesday through Friday and then you just hit send.
0:8:5.50 --> 0:8:11.100

P3:
It would ask if you wanna review who they were going to and I would rarely review them.
0:8:11.210 --> 0:8:12.720

P3:
You know, maybe the first week or two.
0:8:12.730 --> 0:8:16.70

P3:
I did review just to make sure they were in there and working.
0:8:16.410 --> 0:8:19.480

P3:
After that I would just send them and then it was.
0:8:19.490 --> 0:8:28.460

P3:
The funny thing is, is literally seconds and you would start getting responses, so you knew that you know it would go through.
0:8:29.930 --> 0:8:30.210
Moderator
OK.
0:8:28.470 --> 0:8:31.0

P3:
So, umm yeah.
0:8:32.280 --> 0:8:33.390

Moderator
Uh, do you recall?
0:8:33.600 --> 0:8:34.640

Moderator
Ohh go on, I'm sorry.
0:8:32.560 --> 0:8:49.480

P3:
And I was just going to say then, you know, just for the whole process, then we as soon as a screening is answered, you get an email sang and I set up our team, set up the LPN and myself.
0:8:57.300 --> 0:8:57.580

Moderator
OK.
0:8:49.530 --> 0:9:13.120

P3:
She's the surrogate, so we both would get an email letting us know that there was a screening in there to be reviewed, and then we we got into, we learned as we went that it was best for her to go in and save it because she is the one that's going in with the patients and asking all the intake questions and signing the notes.
0:9:14.140 --> 0:9:16.290

P3:
So if I went in and saved.
0:9:17.270 --> 0:9:21.720

P3:
Umm, the BHL screening I would have to tell her.
0:9:21.790 --> 0:9:25.910

P3:
Ohh hey, we have a screening in there otherwise you know it.
0:9:25.920 --> 0:9:34.580

P3:
It just worked better to have the person that's actually going in the room and asking the other intake questions to Avast, you know.
0:9:36.980 --> 0:9:41.40

Moderator
I'm do you recall what you liked about the tool?
0:9:43.360 --> 0:9:45.290

P3:
The ease of use, definitely.
0:9:47.330 --> 0:9:52.140

P3:
Umm, we got a lot more participation from this one than the first one.
0:9:52.150 --> 0:9:55.150

P3:
And I think that was just based off of it being the text messages.
0:9:57.0 --> 0:9:57.790

P3:
To the veterans?
0:9:57.860 --> 0:10:1.960

P3:
Means umm, so yeah yeah.
0:10:3.100 --> 0:10:5.90

Moderator
So the ease of use.
0:10:5.100 --> 0:10:7.670

Moderator
What in particular, what did you find easy?
0:10:8.520 --> 0:10:12.920

P3:
Just sending the screenings was very easy and then saving them to the chart.
0:10:14.120 --> 0:10:18.640

P3:
As you know, all seemed to go very smoothly, at least for our team.
0:10:20.390 --> 0:10:24.640

Moderator
Was there anything that you did you run in run into any problems or any?
0:10:24.950 --> 0:10:27.150

Moderator
Was there anything that you didn't like about the tool?
0:10:28.920 --> 0:10:39.670

P3:
Our biggest thing, we don't we don't like and it's the same as the E screening is that there weren't enough questions built in.
0:10:40.160 --> 0:10:45.950

P3:
So it really didn't save the nurses much time when they went in the room.
0:10:46.220 --> 0:10:50.690

P3:
They still have to go through all the other questions they have.
0:10:50.840 --> 0:10:56.610

P3:
And so, you know, it only some veterans were only given, like one question.
0:10:57.630 --> 0:10:58.110

Moderator
OK.
0:11:13.970 --> 0:11:14.270

Moderator
OK.
0:10:56.840 --> 0:11:14.660

P3:
You know, they only had one reminder of the for five that are in there, only one was due for them and so the time that it takes you know to send the screen and get the email go in the chart, save the chart, the nurse could have easily asked that question in less time.
0:11:14.970 --> 0:11:23.410

P3:
But we we said numerous times, if all the the reminders were built into the system, it would be a huge time saver.
0:11:24.400 --> 0:11:33.680

P3:
But the way it is now with just a few questions per screening, it's not really saving any time the way it is right now.
0:11:36.770 --> 0:11:37.330

P3:
That's OK.
0:11:34.970 --> 0:11:39.610

Moderator
OK, I'm sorry my my, my, my camera so.
0:11:39.0 --> 0:11:42.790

P3:
We had, like we had, we had one of my screens being weird too.
0:11:43.40 --> 0:11:44.480

P3:
We had one veteran.
0:11:46.460 --> 0:11:51.970

P3:
You know, he got one question and it was the sexual orientation question.
0:11:52.800 --> 0:11:53.70

Moderator
OK.
0:11:52.540 --> 0:11:57.430

P3:
And as soon as he got the screening, he was on the phone to us and asking why we were sending out.
0:11:57.440 --> 0:12:3.20

P3:
Quit asking him why he was gay and he was all, you know, bent out of shape over that.
0:12:9.950 --> 0:12:10.180

Moderator
Umm.
0:12:3.170 --> 0:12:15.740

P3:
And I think just the way that you know, if there had been multiple questions and that was one of 10, he wouldn't have been offended by that, but just the fact that he got this text message that asked him, how does he identify?
0:12:16.50 --> 0:12:22.140

P3:
He just took that the wrong way and we had problems with that question with the first, with the E screening as well.
0:12:22.790 --> 0:12:23.520

Moderator
Dude, OK.
0:12:22.150 --> 0:12:29.860

P3:
So it it's just a a difficult question to ask for the nurses and even in the screenings so.
0:12:30.860 --> 0:12:40.660

Moderator
So did it have anything to do that he was maybe on mobile and there were some technical issues where the he couldn't see all of the answer choices or?
0:12:40.600 --> 0:12:46.250

P3:
He he only he just didn't like being asked that one question.
0:12:46.180 --> 0:12:46.340

Moderator
OK.
0:12:46.260 --> 0:12:53.850

P3:
He couldn't understand why were we sending him a special text message to ask him his sexual orientation.
0:12:55.980 --> 0:12:56.320

Moderator
OK.
0:12:55.740 --> 0:12:59.240

P3:
Because he only got the he was only due the one clinical reminder.
0:12:59.630 --> 0:13:2.60

P3:
So he got the one question sent to him.
0:13:3.60 --> 0:13:8.610

P3:
You know, some of them are due three or four tobacco use.
0:13:8.620 --> 0:13:15.980

P3:
You know the different food insecurity, the different questions that were built in there, but he must not have been due for those.
0:13:15.990 --> 0:13:18.710

P3:
So he was just asked about that.
0:13:20.600 --> 0:13:27.890

Moderator
Alice and how many questions would you have liked to see in this screening tool sent out?
0:13:27.960 --> 0:13:28.640

Moderator
What would you think?
0:13:28.490 --> 0:13:30.980
P3:
I I I think around 10 would be great.
0:13:30.900 --> 0:13:31.260

Moderator
10.
0:13:34.350 --> 0:13:36.0

Moderator
And so how many minutes do you think?
0:13:36.10 --> 0:13:38.480

Moderator
10 minutes would save your staff.
0:13:40.300 --> 0:13:41.170

Moderator
10 questions.
0:13:41.180 --> 0:13:41.510

Moderator
I'm sorry.
0:13:43.460 --> 0:13:46.100

P3:
Would probably save 5 minutes in a room.
0:13:49.470 --> 0:13:49.840

Moderator
OK.
0:13:51.250 --> 0:14:0.630

Moderator
So on a scale from one to five, again with one being very easy and five being very difficult, how easy or difficult was it to use the BHL screening?
0:14:2.710 --> 0:14:5.780

P3:
Umm, I would say A1 being the easiest, yes.
0:14:6.940 --> 0:14:15.770

Moderator
OK, so how well did you find that the tool integrated with your existing software and processes?
0:14:16.20 --> 0:14:19.50

Moderator
I think the E screening was a little different for you.
0:14:19.910 --> 0:14:21.680

P3:
Yeah, it seemed to work really well.
0:14:21.690 --> 0:14:39.880

P3:
As far as it took off, the clinical, I think we had trouble with the screening not removing the clinical reminder questions and so then they got asked again, even though then the veterans would say I just answered that in my email and that did not happen with this one.
0:14:39.970 --> 0:14:46.190

P3:
It removed the clinical reminder from, you know, the list of questions that the nurse had to ask.
0:14:47.50 --> 0:15:2.450

P3:
So we didn't get that, you know, the only time we ran into problems and this would go, this would not be a problem if everyone was on board was when we had team LPN's from other teams who weren't aware of the pilot.
0:15:3.360 --> 0:15:14.960

P3:
And then you know, we would, I would have to save the eye screenings and then they would go in the room and they would ask the same questions, not realizing that that had been taking care.
0:15:14.970 --> 0:15:17.90

P3:
Whoops, that that have been taken care of.
0:15:17.460 --> 0:15:22.210

P3:
So we ran into a little problem with that just when we had covering staff members.
0:15:22.220 --> 0:15:25.710

P3:
But I think if everyone was on board, everyone was educated.
0:15:25.720 --> 0:15:27.720

P3:
It would be, you know, second nature.
0:15:28.450 --> 0:15:29.40

Moderator
OK.
0:15:29.550 --> 0:15:36.220

Moderator
And so do you feel like did you have to create any work around processes with the BH tool?
0:15:36.310 --> 0:15:37.810

Moderator
BHL tool excuse me?
0:15:38.900 --> 0:15:39.880

P3:
Now, now.
0:15:39.860 --> 0:15:40.0

Moderator
Yeah.
0:15:41.800 --> 0:15:48.130

Moderator
So can you just briefly mention how that compares to the second to to the first tool, hey?
0:15:50.580 --> 0:15:54.490

P3:
Umm, it's so hard to even remember the first one, honestly.
0:15:58.70 --> 0:15:59.740

P3:
Yeah, I don't really remember that.
0:15:59.750 --> 0:16:2.740

P3:
We had a work around with the first one.
0:16:3.960 --> 0:16:16.310

P3:
It just seemed to, you know, we we didn't get the same satisfaction level because it wasn't taking those clinical reminders away, but there was no real work around with that.
0:16:16.320 --> 0:16:21.560

P3:
It just didn't save us any time because the questions were being asked twice. Yeah.
0:16:22.820 --> 0:16:23.490

Moderator
OK.

0:16:24.300 --> 0:16:39.410

Moderator
So did you notice a difference between the quality of time you spend or your your staff spend with space with patients after implementing the second tool in comparison to having no tool?
0:16:39.520 --> 0:16:43.350

Moderator
So let's just compare BHL with having no tool.
0:16:43.770 --> 0:16:47.340

P3:
Hmm, not honestly, not really.
0:16:47.430 --> 0:17:0.20

P3:
And I talked to my nurses about this only because the time that it does take to send the screening to, even though that's very quick get, that'll email alert.
0:17:0.30 --> 0:17:20.120

P3:
You then have to go into CPRS, into the patients chart, open up the screening, review it, sign it and the time that it takes to do those steps, the nurses can easily ask those for, you know, two to four questions at the veterans might have.
0:17:20.130 --> 0:17:43.350

P3:
That's why we said if there were about 10:00 or so questions that, that, that then it would become your saving time because the questions would take longer than the sending the screening right now with the number of questions there are, you're not, you know it's it's a wash pretty much the time that would have been saved as being taken up by sending the screenings so.
0:17:43.750 --> 0:17:51.940

Moderator
And how have you noticed a decrease or increase in the notifications you received about the clinical reminders?
0:17:55.380 --> 0:17:56.330

P3:
What do you mean the?
0:17:59.0 --> 0:18:1.430

Moderator
The notifications UM.
0:18:3.400 --> 0:18:5.120

Moderator
Kristen did do you?
0:18:5.600 --> 0:18:7.170

Moderator
Can you elaborate on that?
0:18:7.180 --> 0:18:7.580

Moderator
I'm sorry.
0:18:8.600 --> 0:18:10.150

Mcconnell, Kristen A.
Umm, it could.
0:18:10.200 --> 0:18:16.440

Mcconnell, Kristen A.
It could be the amount of emails you got or the amount of like sayings and CPRS that had to be dealt with.
0:18:17.530 --> 0:18:20.50

Mcconnell, Kristen A.
Has that increased or decreased?
0:18:21.90 --> 0:18:29.70

P3:
That's hard for me because I don't do the clinical reminders the LPN's do, so they would be probably a better question for them.
0:18:29.780 --> 0:18:37.10

P3:
Umm for their interviews because I don't do the clinical reminders. Umm.
0:18:38.930 --> 0:18:45.350

P3:
The only thing I could say is we definitely had better their participation with the BHL.
0:18:46.540 --> 0:18:50.30

P3:
Umm, but I don't know if it cut down on their reminders.
0:18:50.80 --> 0:18:50.590

P3:
I don't.
0:18:51.960 --> 0:18:52.650

Moderator
OK.
0:18:53.360 --> 0:18:56.290

Moderator
And I know the answer to this question, but I'm just gonna ask it.
0:18:56.300 --> 0:18:59.550

Moderator
Would you agree or disagree with the following statement?
0:18:59.600 --> 0:19:6.200

Moderator
Overall clinical reminder, Burton has been reduced by implementing the BHL screening tool.
0:19:9.120 --> 0:19:11.660

P3:
Umm, clinical reminder.
0:19:14.700 --> 0:19:16.730

P3:
That's a yes and no actually.
0:19:17.560 --> 0:19:18.30

Moderator
OK.
0:19:18.40 --> 0:19:19.680

Moderator
Can you elaborate on that please?
0:19:19.380 --> 0:19:30.0

P3:
UM, it is nice that you know something like the sexual orientation question is taken off of the LPN not having to ask that because it's answered for her.
0:19:30.100 --> 0:19:34.210

P3:
I know that's a hard question for them to ask. Umm.
0:19:36.110 --> 0:19:41.900

P3:
But that question aside, it you know it really there was not.
0:19:41.910 --> 0:19:44.920

P3:
It does not take a lot of time to ask the questions.
0:19:44.930 --> 0:19:46.140

P3:
Are you still smoking?
0:19:46.150 --> 0:19:51.400

P3:
You know, are you just the three questions that were built in were real quick? Yes.

P3:
No answers.
0:19:54.510 --> 0:19:54.870

P3:
So.
0:19:55.670 --> 0:20:0.320
Moderator
OK, how could BHL be improved or changed?
0:20:0.370 --> 0:20:0.690

Moderator
Changed.
0:20:4.340 --> 0:20:4.620

Moderator
OK.
0:20:1.830 --> 0:20:4.960

P3:
Just by adding more questions, I'm more reminders.
0:20:4.970 --> 0:20:5.360

P3:
More.
0:20:5.370 --> 0:20:6.680

P3:
Yeah, that would be.
0:20:6.810 --> 0:20:11.270

 P3:
I think it would be a great tool once it has a lot of the questions in there.
0:20:13.260 --> 0:20:19.690

P3:
Because it would be a time saver if if they do the screening for sure, yeah.
0:20:19.850 --> 0:20:26.950

Moderator
And do you feel that the HL maintains an appropriate level of safety and clinical integrity?
0:20:27.650 --> 0:20:28.390

P3:
Yes, yes.
0:20:30.10 --> 0:20:30.540

Moderator
OK.
0:20:30.610 --> 0:20:40.430

Moderator
And could you, do you have any comments on that on what on what part, what aspects of safety or clinical integrity?
0:20:42.80 --> 0:20:47.200

P3:
Well, when you say clinical integrity, I assume you meant like the privacy of the veteran and?
0:20:49.420 --> 0:20:52.790

P3:
So yeah, I I we didn't have any trouble with that.
0:20:53.180 --> 0:20:53.500

Moderator
OK.
0:20:52.800 --> 0:21:1.150

P3:
I think the system worked really well and umm, it definitely makes sure that the questions are asked.
0:21:1.160 --> 0:21:13.450

P3:
You know, it's not something then that somebody could just skip over and check off and say that they did ask, you know, they're definitely that's on the onus of the veteran.
0:21:13.460 --> 0:21:14.750

P3:
Then to answer the question.
0:21:17.450 --> 0:21:18.810

Moderator
Are you able to answer?
0:21:20.970 --> 0:21:34.330

Moderator
Whether you noticed a difference in the quality of time stuffs spent with patients after implementing the second tool in comparison to E screening, are you able to remember that?
0:21:35.570 --> 0:21:37.400

P3:
That the staff spent with the veteran.
0:21:37.580 --> 0:21:38.10

Moderator
Yeah.
0:21:38.20 --> 0:21:45.930

Moderator
Whether they get, whether there was an an increase in the quality of time with one tool versus the other.
0:21:47.710 --> 0:21:52.280

P3:
No, the only feedback at like I said, I'm never in the room with the veterans.
0:21:52.290 --> 0:21:55.820

P3:
As far as the with the intake, that's on the LPN side.
0:21:55.830 --> 0:21:57.620

P3:
When they room the veterans.
0:22:8.630 --> 0:22:8.930

Moderator
OK.
0:21:58.100 --> 0:22:9.520
P3:
And so I just have gotten their feedback of saying that it really was not a time saver because it does not take them long to ask those few questions.
0:22:9.960 --> 0:22:21.920

P3:
If all the intake questions were built in and, they could just, you know, they didn't even have to do that portion, it would just be the provider reviewing the note before he goes into the room.
0:22:25.10 --> 0:22:25.310

Moderator
OK.
0:22:23.440 --> 0:22:27.90
P3:
It would be quicker, it would save the LPN some time for sure.
0:22:28.680 --> 0:22:28.980

Moderator
Right.
0:22:28.560 --> 0:22:33.930

P3:
The provider was still have to review the note, so I don't know that it would save him a lot of time.
0:22:33.940 --> 0:22:34.690

P3:
I'm sure it is.
0:22:45.740 --> 0:22:46.160

Moderator
OK.
0:22:34.700 --> 0:22:46.230

P3:
It's a lot quicker to read the answers, and if there's a flag about something, discuss it then to have to go through, you know, each response yourself. So.
0:22:46.220 --> 0:22:52.160

Moderator
How, once there was a positive screen or how were the consults directed?
0:22:55.570 --> 0:22:56.160

P3:
I can't.
0:22:53.270 --> 0:22:56.840

Moderator
Could can you explain that process a little bit?
0:22:56.170 --> 0:22:57.600

P3:
I can't answer that.
0:22:57.420 --> 0:22:58.260

Moderator
No. OK.
0:22:57.610 --> 0:22:59.400

P3:
Yeah, that's that's above.
0:22:59.410 --> 0:22:59.640

P3:
Yeah.
0:23:0.190 --> 0:23:1.320

Moderator
OK.
0:22:59.650 --> 0:23:1.480

P3:
What I would do, yeah.
0:23:2.290 --> 0:23:6.600

Moderator
Kristen, do you have any questions that you like to ask, Redacted?
0:23:11.140 --> 0:23:15.590

Mcconnell, Kristen A.
About comparing just the first tool to no tool, no, not really.
0:23:15.600 --> 0:23:16.890

Mcconnell, Kristen A.
I think there's some questions about.
0:23:18.890 --> 0:23:21.640

Mcconnell, Kristen A.
Comparing like just directly comparing the two tools.
0:23:25.130 --> 0:23:46.380

P3:
Umm, I think they were very similar but for whatever reason we got a lot more response from the second one from the BHL that it was about the same amount of time on our end with both tools and with the same questions built in.
0:23:46.390 --> 0:23:50.480

P3:
So it's saved, you know, it took about as much time saved about as much time.
0:23:50.490 --> 0:23:58.260

P3:
So it was really just more that we saw such a better response rate and the second tool and I don't know what the reason is.
0:23:58.270 --> 0:24:1.470

P3:
Like I said, maybe just the text message works better.
0:24:2.440 --> 0:24:4.970

P3:
I think that's how they received these.
0:24:5.480 --> 0:24:9.60

P3:
The BHL was that it was via text, right?
0:24:11.620 --> 0:24:12.940

Moderator
I'll let Christian answer them.
0:24:11.920 --> 0:24:13.860

Mcconnell, Kristen A.
Yes they can, yes.
0:24:17.860 --> 0:24:18.110

Mcconnell, Kristen A.
Umm.
0:24:14.870 --> 0:24:26.590

P3:
And the first one was an email and so and I think that getting a text message, almost everyone has a cell phone now and they go as soon as they get a text message.
0:24:26.600 --> 0:24:27.90

P3:
Alert.
0:24:27.100 --> 0:24:31.490

P3:
They go out in and look at it where his emails sometimes not always like that.
0:24:36.160 --> 0:24:36.440

Moderator
OK.
0:24:32.440 --> 0:24:36.590

P3:
So we did get a better response rate for sure I would.

Mcconnell, Kristen A.
So if you had a choice in which tool you would implement nationwide, what would you choose?
0:24:41.250 --> 0:24:42.540

P3:
They'll be at the beach.
0:24:42.550 --> 0:24:45.110

P3:
All I think you would get a better response rate with it.
0:24:48.140 --> 0:25:1.440

P3:
If there was a tool that could send it both, I mean email and text maybe, but yeah, I I think the BHL would since we got probably I don't know, 40% response rate.
0:25:1.450 --> 0:25:7.530

P3:
I don't know if you have any statistics on it, but for our team it seemed around 40%.
0:25:11.800 --> 0:25:12.150

Moderator
So if.
0:25:12.50 --> 0:25:13.890

Mcconnell, Kristen A.
And then we'll go ahead, Nina.
0:25:14.370 --> 0:25:14.900

Moderator
No.
0:25:14.950 --> 0:25:18.700

Moderator
If I was just going to ask if you had any more questions, Kristen, but please go ahead.


Mcconnell, Kristen A.
Umm I'm looking.
0:25:25.870 --> 0:25:26.740

Mcconnell, Kristen A.
No, because you did.
0:25:26.750 --> 0:25:32.690

Mcconnell, Kristen A.
You did already ask if like if you could change one thing you did ask that one I.
0:25:31.210 --> 0:25:40.140

Moderator
I did and and A and a lot of these questions I did ask in a in an implicit I I think Redacted gave me an implicit answer to these.
0:25:38.780 --> 0:25:40.220

Mcconnell, Kristen A.
Yeah, I agree.
0:25:41.510 --> 0:25:43.30

Mcconnell, Kristen A.
So now I don't think I have anything else.
0:25:44.460 --> 0:25:45.50

Moderator
OK.
0:25:45.100 --> 0:25:48.810

Moderator
So Redacted, thank you so much for joining us again.
0:25:48.820 --> 0:25:55.950

Moderator
I know this was, you know, a lot for you to come to two different sessions and we really appreciate you spending the time with us.
0:25:55.70 --> 0:25:56.630

P3:
Ohh sure sure.
0:25:56.710 --> 0:25:58.310

P3:
I hope some of the nurses talk to you.
0:26:0.510 --> 0:26:2.200

Moderator
Yes. Yeah.
0:25:58.320 --> 0:26:9.340
P3:
'Cause, I know they would be better at you know that the way that because I'm not real familiar with the the whole intake and I'm never in a room to see how the veterans respond.
0:26:9.350 --> 0:26:11.40

P3:
So they would be a lot better.
0:26:14.310 --> 0:26:14.470

Moderator
We.
0:26:12.580 --> 0:26:15.970

P3:
Ah, to ask those questions too, for sure.
0:26:16.870 --> 0:26:22.40

Moderator
Yeah, we did get some great feedback from a nurse manager earlier today.
0:26:22.530 --> 0:26:23.390

P3:
Oh, good, good.
0:26:22.50 --> 0:26:24.630

Moderator
So yes, it was very helpful.
0:26:26.290 --> 0:26:26.540

P3:
That.
0:26:25.850 --> 0:26:26.620

Mcconnell, Kristen A.
We did.
0:26:26.630 --> 0:26:34.520

Mcconnell, Kristen A.
I don't think we've had everybody reached back out to sign up, so if you want, if you wanna talk to your colleagues who you know, we're part of the pilot just to be like, hey, you should really give your feedback.
0:26:34.530 --> 0:26:35.700

Mcconnell, Kristen A.
That would help us out too.
0:26:39.40 --> 0:26:39.400

P3:
OK.
0:26:35.790 --> 0:26:41.110
Mcconnell, Kristen A.
I know we do have a lot of people signed up though, but it if you wanna double check that would be very helpful.
0:26:42.590 --> 0:26:43.130

P3:
OK.
0:26:44.240 --> 0:26:44.780

Mcconnell, Kristen A.
Thank you.
0:26:45.230 --> 0:26:46.80

P3:
Alright, sure.
0:26:45.500 --> 0:26:47.50

Moderator
Have a good day, Redacted.
0:26:47.340 --> 0:26:47.560

Moderator
Bye. Bye.
0:26:47.110 --> 0:26:48.80

P3:
All right, you too.
