## Intro - 5 minutes 

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Kristen] and I'm a researcher at OCTO working on this health questionnaires, clinical reminder pilot. There are also a few of my colleagues on the call who will be observing and take notes.  
  
Today we're going to talk about your experience using [BHL or eScreening] to send out clinical reminders as well as the process to review the screener responses. Our goal is to listen and use your feedback to evaluate BHL and eScreening and improve the clinical reminder process for Veterans and staff like yourself.
 
Before we start, I want to mention a couple things:
- We want to hear your honest opinions. We will not be offended by any opinions you express. We welcome your feedback.
- If for any reason, and at any time, you want to stop this session, just let me know.

- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We just use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. None of your comments will be attributed to you directly. If we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information. Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
