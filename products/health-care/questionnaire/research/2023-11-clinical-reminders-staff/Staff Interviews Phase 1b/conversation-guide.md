## Intro - 5 minutes  

### For participants who were interviewed in Phase 1a: 
Thanks for joining us again for the second part of the pilot!  

- As you may recall from our last interview session, my name is [Nina] and I'm a researcher at OCTO working on the health questionnaires, clinical reminder pilot.  

- There are also a few of my colleagues on the call who will be observing and taking notes. I’ll have them introduce themselves. 

- Today we're going to talk about your experience using the BHL and the eScreening screening tools to send out clinical reminders to Veterans, and we will have you compare and contrast using the tools. 

- Before we start, I want to mention a couple things: 

- We want to hear your honest opinions. We will not be offended by any opinions you express. We welcome your feedback. 

- Today’s session should take about 30-45 minutes. If for any reason, and at any time, you want to stop this session, just let me know. 

- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?  

- We just use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.  

- None of your comments will be attributed to you directly. If we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information.  

- Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? 

- Okay, great. 

**Note to Moderator:** Record Session and move on to questions. 

- Once again for the record, are you comfortable if we record this session?

-  And lastly, we’d like to get your opinion on which of the two tools is the most efficient to use, so we can improve the clinical reminder process for Veterans and staff like yourself. Does that sound good to you? Great.
