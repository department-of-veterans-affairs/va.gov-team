# Research Findings for Clinical Reminders: Health Questionnaire Tools Staff Interviews 1a

The volume of clinical reminders has been impacting the quality of the time the patient spends with the provider. Providers have also reported increased burden due to data entry and notification fatigue. Therefore, Veteran Health Administration (VHA) is in search of a tool that allows customizable and standardized health forms, screeners, and questionnaires to be sent to the patient to collect responses asynchronously. Through an earlier evaluation, it was identified that VA already has two digital questionnaire tools within our ecosystem, Behavioral Health Labs (BHL) and eScreening, that can meet many, but not all our process and technological needs. OCC, OCTO, and VHA program offices agreed to complete a pilot to gather more insight to compare the tools.

The following reminders will be completed by Veterans and reviewed by staff during the pilot:
-  VA-EMBEDDED FRAGMENTS SCREEN
-  VA-HOMELESSNESS/FOOD INSECURITY SCREENING
-  VA-MH TOBACCO USE SCREENING (OUTPT)
-  VA-SEXUAL ORIENTATION
-  VA-TBI SCREENING
-  VA-TOXIC EXPOSURE SCREENING

These reminders were chosen due to their shorter workflows that do not require any changes to convert them to a digital questionnaire. With the PACT Act’s expansion of benefits, there is also a more immediate need for a digital questionnaire to collect responses from Veterans for conditions related to toxic exposure. 

Work to confirm the digital workflows for each reminder has already been completed by OCC in collaboration with each program office overseeing each reminder.

   <br> 
 <br>

## Research goals
The goal of this research is to discover the following:
-  To gather staff feedback during Phase 1a (before crossing over to the other tool)
-  How easy was it to learn to use the tool?
-  How easy was the configuration/set up process for the tool?
-  How long did it take to learn to use the tool?
-  Would providers change anything about the training they received? If yes, what?
-  How easy is the tool to utilize?
-  Was data entry simplified?
-  Was notification fatigue reduced?
-  Was overall clinic reminder burden reduced?
-  Did the quality of the time providers spend with patients improve?
-  How much time do providers estimate was saved by collecting these clinical reminder responses prior to the appointment?
-  Were providers workflows affected either positively or negatively? If yes, how?
-  Do providers feel this process maintains an appropriate level of safety and clinical integrity?
-  How does BHL compare to eScreening for each requirement? Which tool is preferred?
-  How could the tools or experience be improved or changed?
-  what was the final process for sending, receiving, and reviewing these questionnaires implemented at each location?
 <br> 
 <br>
 
## Hypothesis
The tool will reduce overall clinical reminder burden for providers, including data entry and notification fatigue.
Providers will perceive digital questionnaires to be a safe way to gather this information from Veterans.
Provider will identify areas to improve the ease of use within the tool.

## Key findings

**Finding 1:** 6 out of 6 participants stated that learning how to utilize both BHL and eScreening was easy, but they relied on different channels to ask follow-up questions for the first few weeks of the pilot.

-  6 stated formal training consisted of one presentation that took 30-60 minutes via Teams.
-  1 stated they watched the presentation in a conference room.
-  6 mentioned it took them a few minutes up to 20 minutes to learn the tool. 
-  Some mentioned that they asked numerous follow-up questions via weekly huddles or Teams channels for the first few weeks of the pilot.

> P4: *“Tried it twice and caught on.”* (eScreening)

>P7: *“I think I caught on pretty quickly…After learning the tool a lot of questions came up. So, it wasn't like you learned it and it is was smooth from that point on…there was a lot of communication back with the team on how to handle things.”* (BHL)
       
**Recommendation:** While onboarding future sites, make sure they set up a mechanism for questions during the first few weeks.
  <br> 
 <br>

**Finding 2:** 4 out of 6 participants suggested improvements to the training, such as access to the tool during training, a step-by-step guide on what to do about positive results, and a frequently asked question document.

> P7: *“What if a Veteran says that he is having some housing insecurity, but is not ready or doesn't want to have a consult placed…For the smoking, what do we do if that comes up positive?”* (BHL)

> P1: *“[I would like to have a] hands-on portion with the training, [and] to be able to use the tool as they're talking, because I learned better that way.”* (BHL)

> P3: *“We had a meeting with everyone, but it was very vague, and everyone was confused. A week later, everything got loaded, and we kind of taught ourselves at our desk. It made a lot more sense once everything was loaded, and we were able to practice with actual patients, and not test patients.“* (eScreening)


**Recommendation:** Provide staff with clear guidance on the next steps for a positive result. Look into giving trainees access to the tool during the training sessions. Create an FAQ document.

       <br> 
 <br>

**Finding 4a:** All 3 eScreening staff had to devise workarounds to address the following problems: appointment statuses were changed to checked in when the screener was pushed to VistA and appointments were checked out if the clinical note with screener information was reviewed in VistA.

> P3: *"At first, MSA pushed the note to VIstA right away, but that would check patients into their appointment. It also caused problems if the patient cancelled, because then you had a note in there.. Later, we would wait until the Veteran checked in to save the note to VistA. Waiting until someone checked in meant that it would get forgotten sometimes. When the LPN signed the note, the appointment would be checked out. This caused confusion to central scheduling, because they would think the Veteran was checked out before they even checked in. They printed a list of all the appointments for the day and marked which ones had eScreening results, so they would know to push it when the Veteran checked in."*

> P3:*“We have this note saved, and the veteran either rescheduled or no showed…We were messaging into the eScreening huddle…the support group in the Teams chat. We would just ask them to get rid of the note for us, because they were able to do that out of the CPRS side.”*

**Recommendation:** Advise new sites on how to configure eScreening and how best to set up their workflow, so these problems with check-in and check-out don't occur. 
  <br> 
 <br>

**Finding 4b:** 1 participant mentioned their team sent letters out informing Veterans that they will be receiving clinical reminder screeners in their email before their appointment.

> P3:  *"We were also having to send out letters letting the Veterans know that they're going to be getting an email."* eScreening

**Recommendation:** Investigate adding a sentence or two to the appointment reminder letters that the Veteran may receive digital screeners to complete prior to their appointment.

 <br> 
 <br>

**Finding 6:** 2 out of 3 BHL participants agreed that this pilot saved them time during their day, while all 3 eScreening participants didn't see time-saving or data entry benefits.

-  Reasons eScreening participants aren't seeing time-saving or data entry benefits:
    - Reminders were not being removed from the eScreening lists after the screeners are uploaded to VistA.
    - Not all clinical reminders are asked digitally.
    - BHL participants also mentioned this improvement.
    - Notifications about completed screeners are intermingled with other notifications.
 
> P2: *"Yes, it was [simplified]. It was nice to have the information ahead of time; a few less questions to ask."* BHL

>P6: *"It definitely…added, I wouldn't say it decreased honestly at all. I'd say more so it added…With totaling between what I'm doing, and what the LPN's doing…I'd say at least half an hour [per day].”* eScreening

P6: *“Things weren't getting cleared off. So, she could sign in CPRS after I uploaded it, but it wasn't taking off for the clinical reminder even when she would do the refresh in CPRS. So, it was still more work for her.”* eScreening

P3> *“The way the pilot was set up with just a few clinical reminders… it didn't save us anytime; it made us spend more time…We said if all the clinical reminders were in there, and the veterans actually completed all the reminders…that could be a great tool.”* eScreening

>P4: *“I have to go through my notifications and weed out what's new and what's my unsigned health prevention eScreening notes that are just there waiting for me."* eScreening

 
**Finding 7:** 5 out 6 participants believed both tools maintained an appropriate level of safety and integrity. They most often associated safety and integrity with more genuine answers from the Veteran.

-  Participants theorized that Veterans would be more likely to answer the screeners more genuinely on their own than with a staff member in the office. 
-  The pilot uncovered at least one instance where the digital screener for the same Veteran came back positive, while the same in-person screener was negative. 

**Recommendation:** Try to digitalize as many clinical reminders as possible.
 <br> 
 <br>


**Findings:** When discussing email and CPRS clinical reminder notifications, 2 out of 3 BHL participants experienced a decrease in notifications and 1 BHL participant experienced an increase.

> P7: *“A decrease. If they are taking care of it on their end, when I get them in the room, I might have like 4 to over with them.”* BHL

**Note***2 out 3 eScreening participants stated that they didn't deal with notifications due to their role as ASMAs, while the eScreening LPN didn't comments on notification increases or decreases. They just saw reviewing the notifications in CPRS as a key part of their position, so they would address anything notifications that came in.


**Findings 9:** 3 out 6 participants mentioned that adding other clinical reminders would greatly improve staff processes and current clinical reminder burden, but they expressed concern about being able to appropriately address mental health responses when answered digitally prior to an appointment.

> P3: *"If all the clinical reminders were in there and the Veterans actually completed all of the reminders before, that could be a great tool.”* eScreening

> P2: *"It would be wonderful to see if there's a way to expand what we are asking; the LPNs still have a lot of reminders to ask in addition to the ones we're sending out. But at least it takes a little but off their plate…the biggest concern would be obviously the mental health ones and making sure that would require separate follow up process for those things that are positive...it sounds like another team uses it for that, so they must have figured it out...[how to] ensure patient safety.”* BHL


**Recommendation:** To increase efficiency, send as many clinical reminders digitally to the Veteran prior to an appointment as possible.


**Finding 10:** 4 out of 6 users suggested automatically sending the screener responses to CPRS, because it would decrease their workloads and prevent forgetting to push the answers to CPRS.

> P2: *"I don't believe there was any time that myself, or any of the others, didn't end up pushing something through to CPRS. It seems...an unnecessary step; you would still have the opportunity to delete the note if you thought for some reason, you didn't want it to be in their chart."*

> P7: *“It would be great if you didn't have to do upload all results! If it just blew right into CPRS, I could come in in the morning, I could take a look. I could see all the view alerts. I could just click on it right, take a quick look at them, sign them off, and then I could get started with my day...It's another thing like to think about when you come in in the morning and I have to be honest, sometimes I come in and I'm like, oh, I forgot to do BHL.”*

We hypothesize that some eScreening participants didn't mention this improvement due to the workflow challenges experienced, which included checking in the appointment when pushing answers to CPRS.

**Recommendation:** Explore automatically creating an historical clinical note in CPRS when the Veteran submits their answers.

**Finding 11:** Staff recommendations for improving tools:

**BHL**
-  1 participant would like for screeners to be automatically sent to Veterans depending on when their appointment was scheduled for. They don't want to have to set up the clinical reminders each week to be sent out.
-  1 participant proposed positive reminders could auto-populate for the nursing staff to complete, when MSAs send out the reminders.

**eScreening**
-  1 participant recommended anyone covering for a LPN should have access to sign the note.
-  1 participant wanted to see pending batteries to help decrease them forgetting what they already started or completed. 
-  1 participant wants screeners for past appointments removed from their eScreening dashboard. 
-  1 participant wanted the ability to transfer screener to rescheduled appointments.

  
## TES Navigator Findings

**TES Navigator Finding 1:** Clinical Reminder Pilot Awareness

-  No knowledge of the screening tool until 2 weeks before this interview.
-  Didn't have access to screening tool or know what the tool really did.
  
> “I don't think I need anything else. Power BI is awesome. I don't know what BHL will do for me if I have access.”


**TES Navigator Finding 2:** TES Navigator Workflow

[TES Navigator Workflow]( https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/questionnaire/research/2023-11-clinical-reminders-staff/Staff%20Interviews%20Phase%201a/TES%20Navigator%20Workflow.jpg)

> *“The letter and My HealtheVet have really helped.”*
> "Nobody really answers their phone anymore."*


**TES Navigator Finding 3:** Improvement ideas and challenges encountered

-  Wants access to the follow-up question responses in the clinical reminder for all Veterans (even screeners closed by providers) to double check all Veterans with questions are getting their questions answered.
-  Reported some Veterans becoming "scared" when hearing the word "toxic" mentioned during phone calls.
Concerned about false positives/negatives and coding hazards improperly.
-  "A LPN asked a Vet if he had any embedded fragments, and he said yes. He had a metal in his wrist (surgically implanted) and the LPN listed that the Veteran had embedded fragments. When in fact he didn't, he had metal hardware implanted in his wrist.”
-  Screener question that the TES Navigator would like to see all responses for.
