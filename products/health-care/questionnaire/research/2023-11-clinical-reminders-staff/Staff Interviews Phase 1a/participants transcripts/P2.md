Just use the recordings to confirm that we captured your opinions accurately. 

0:0:3.980 --> 0:0:15.10 
Moderator: 
None of your comments will be attributed to you directly, and if we do quote you in the research study, we'll take away any identifying information and we'll just say like staff one umm. 

0:0:15.840 --> 0:0:28.80 
Moderator: 
So with that, my very first question is on a scale from one to five with one being very easy and five being very difficult. 

0:0:28.280 --> 0:0:32.130 
Moderator: 
How easy or difficult was it to learn how to use BHL? 

0:0:35.40 --> 0:0:35.460 
P2: 
Umm. 

0:0:36.540 --> 0:0:37.130 
P2: 
I'm sorry. 

0:0:37.140 --> 0:0:37.810 
P2: 
What one was easy. 

0:0:39.40 --> 0:0:41.120 
Moderator: 
11 is very crazy, yeah. 

0:0:39.770 --> 0:0:42.30 
P2: 
One, I would say one. 

0:0:43.380 --> 0:0:43.830 
Moderator: 
OK. 

0:0:44.320 --> 0:0:47.170 
Moderator: 
And then how long did it take you to learn to use the tool? 

0:0:49.590 --> 0:0:57.360 
P2: 
Umm, I'm pretty comfortable with programs and computers, but I would say 20 minutes. 

0:0:58.180 --> 0:0:58.630 
Moderator: 
OK. 

0:0:59.540 --> 0:1:1.520 
Moderator: 
And can you describe your onboarding process? 

0:1:3.550 --> 0:1:4.170 
P2: 
With the program? 

0:1:4.700 --> 0:1:4.990 
Moderator: 
Umm. 

0:1:5.600 --> 0:1:6.990 
P2: 
Umm sure. 

0:1:7.0 --> 0:1:14.500 
P2: 
I attended a teams UMM and I believe someone shared their screen and showed. 

0:1:16.130 --> 0:1:23.280 
P2: 
Maybe a physician from Aldi's showed how he utilizes it in his daily practice and then I just kind of figured it out on my own. 

0:1:24.150 --> 0:1:24.480 
Moderator: 
OK. 

0:1:25.140 --> 0:1:29.750 
P2: 
I would say it took I in teaching other staff depending on the staff members. 

0:1:29.760 --> 0:1:33.560 
P2: 
It took some people longer than it took me personally, but. 

0:1:33.410 --> 0:1:36.170 
Moderator: 
So you were in, you were involved with training the other people there. 

0:1:36.830 --> 0:1:37.500 
P2: 
Yeah. 

0:1:37.510 --> 0:1:37.820 
P2: 
Yep. 

0:1:39.860 --> 0:1:40.0 
Moderator: 
Yeah. 

0:1:37.870 --> 0:1:40.600 
P2: 
So I'm a manager of one of the clinics here so. 

0:1:41.630 --> 0:1:42.920 
Moderator: 
So how many? 

0:1:43.390 --> 0:1:45.960 
Moderator: 
What was the impact to that you training other people? 

0:1:45.970 --> 0:1:47.270 
Moderator: 
So how long did it take? 

0:1:47.280 --> 0:1:48.490 
Moderator: 
Roughly how many people? 

0:1:50.60 --> 0:1:51.870 
P2: 
I mean, it was just me. 

0:1:51.880 --> 0:1:55.470 
P2: 
I would say and then we also all attended that same teams meeting. 

0:1:56.120 --> 0:1:56.600 
P2: 
Umm. 

0:1:56.880 --> 0:2:6.200 
P2: 
But probably a couple hours or several hours over a span of time. 

0:2:6.910 --> 0:2:8.740 
P2: 
Just kind of through the course of when. 

0:2:10.240 --> 0:2:12.200 
P2: 
Screen screenings were returned. 

0:2:12.210 --> 0:2:18.730 
P2: 
Then they would ask me to come to their office to help them figure out how to process that. 

0:2:26.310 --> 0:2:26.590 
Moderator: 
OK. 

0:2:18.920 --> 0:2:26.690 
P2: 
So if that so I would say like 3 hours if you know kind of all lumped together over. 

0:2:27.180 --> 0:2:29.260 
P2: 
Yeah, course of a couple weeks. 

0:2:31.10 --> 0:2:35.780 
Moderator: 
And if you could change one thing about onboarding or the training you received, what would it be? 

0:2:38.970 --> 0:2:39.650 
P2: 
Ah. 

0:2:42.670 --> 0:2:44.630 
P2: 
I don't think anything too much. 

0:2:44.640 --> 0:2:46.870 
P2: 
I think the meetings are a little bit confusing. 

0:2:47.280 --> 0:2:49.480 
P2: 
Umm, who? 

0:2:49.490 --> 0:2:56.950 
P2: 
Actually, I'll take that back at the beginning, it was a little bit I had to put in a little bit of effort to get access to the program. 

0:2:56.960 --> 0:3:5.10 
P2: 
So ideally, if the staff involved had access to the program, that might save a little bit of time for people participating. 

0:3:6.470 --> 0:3:13.430 
P2: 
So I had to reach out to a couple different people and screen share and that sort of thing to get people access. 

0:3:13.730 --> 0:3:16.340 
P2: 
So I don't know if there's a way to streamline that part. 

0:3:16.540 --> 0:3:18.460 
P2: 
And then I think there's a little bit of confusion. 

0:3:21.290 --> 0:3:21.620 
Moderator: 
Umm. 

0:3:18.470 --> 0:3:30.140 
P2: 
We didn't realize this was like a two part pilot program, so there was sometimes myself and then other staff in my area were a little bit confused on meetings of what was going on or what's going to happen next. 

0:3:30.150 --> 0:3:32.700 
P2: 
I think we all just thought this was the one we were using, so. 

0:3:33.590 --> 0:3:34.40 
P2: 
Umm. 

0:3:34.610 --> 0:3:40.430 
P2: 
So maybe a little bit more clarity about what the overall goal was there. 

0:3:40.440 --> 0:3:41.310 
P2: 
Maybe that's on purpose. 

0:3:43.540 --> 0:3:44.10 
Moderator: 
OK. 

0:3:41.320 --> 0:3:44.860 
P2: 
I'm not sure, I guess, but yeah. 

0:3:44.20 --> 0:3:45.410 
Moderator: 
Sounds very good feedback. 

0:3:45.480 --> 0:3:46.0 
Moderator: 
So I was like. 

0:3:45.410 --> 0:3:50.600 
P2: 
Sometimes in the meetings we weren't quite sure if we were still supposed to be on or what was going on. 

0:3:50.750 --> 0:3:53.790 
P2: 
A little out of the loop, if that makes sense, but it was OK. 

0:3:53.30 --> 0:4:6.580 
Moderator: 
As it from our research purpose I can tell you so we definitely do want to compare since you are crossing over to the other one at the end of that I would we would love to interview you again to see how they experience went with the two tools. 

0:4:6.590 --> 0:4:11.200 
Moderator: 
Then you can compare and contrast of the training and how easy it is to use and things like that. 

0:4:11.210 --> 0:4:13.770 
Moderator: 
So I'm at the end of the flip. 

0:4:15.560 --> 0:4:16.30 
P2: 
OK. 

0:4:16.40 --> 0:4:16.250 
P2: 
Yeah. 

0:4:13.780 --> 0:4:16.850 
Moderator: 
You'll be hearing again from you know, myself. 

0:4:16.260 --> 0:4:25.590 
P2: 
So I don't think we knew there was gonna be two programs so that but we made it just missed a meeting or something. 

0:4:25.600 --> 0:4:26.260 
P2: 
So yeah. 

0:4:26.70 --> 0:4:26.500 
Moderator: 
OK. 

0:4:26.970 --> 0:4:32.980 
Moderator: 
Do you think everybody there understands that now or do you think they would still benefit from? 

0:4:32.160 --> 0:4:36.110 
P2: 
Yes, we figured it out because at the last meeting they said to stop using it. 

0:4:36.880 --> 0:4:37.100 
Moderator: 
OK. 

0:4:36.560 --> 0:4:39.160 
P2: 
So that we that we figured it out. 

0:4:40.20 --> 0:4:40.430 
Moderator: 
OK. 

0:4:40.680 --> 0:4:43.180 
Moderator: 
Any other things you would change about onboarding or training? 

0:4:45.360 --> 0:4:47.580 
P2: 
Umm. No. 

0:4:47.590 --> 0:4:47.990 
P2: 
Nope. 

0:4:48.0 --> 0:4:54.410 
P2: 
I think the biggest thing was just be making sure that, umm, people have access to the program. 

0:4:54.420 --> 0:5:3.40 
P2: 
A little bit of that seemed to kind of fall to our OSS to figure out what we weren't quite sure because we're not familiar with the program, how that all worked out so. 

0:5:5.240 --> 0:5:7.400 
P2: 
Back it was easy enough. 

0:5:6.320 --> 0:5:7.640 
Moderator: 
And he said it serious. 

0:5:8.520 --> 0:5:11.860 
Moderator: 
To get people access, you just contacted a few. 

0:5:11.870 --> 0:5:14.520 
Moderator: 
You reach out to a few different people and screen and shared. 

0:5:14.530 --> 0:5:15.230 
Moderator: 
That was the. 

0:5:15.270 --> 0:5:16.860 
Moderator: 
That was the process of how you figured it out. 

0:5:17.100 --> 0:5:17.500 
P2: 
Yeah. 

0:5:17.510 --> 0:5:24.460 
P2: 
And then I had to put in a request to believe to get some people added to the program. 

0:5:32.390 --> 0:5:32.590 
Moderator: 
OK. 

0:5:26.720 --> 0:5:35.400 
P2: 
So a few things that maybe if there was any way that part could be done, I had a time that might help streamline it a little bit. 

0:5:38.410 --> 0:5:38.770 
P2: 
That's all. 

0:5:38.290 --> 0:5:42.80 
Moderator: 
Were you part of configuring the tool for your site at all? 

0:5:44.320 --> 0:5:46.450 
P2: 
No, no, no. 

0:5:46.840 --> 0:5:47.170 
Moderator: 
And then. 

0:5:46.560 --> 0:5:54.450 
P2: 
Just gave feedback on like site specifics that might be great adjustments for the future, but nothing. 

0:5:54.460 --> 0:5:55.170 
P2: 
Yeah, nothing. 

0:5:56.870 --> 0:5:59.120 
Moderator: 
Could you share a little bit more about some of those? 

0:5:59.410 --> 0:6:0.520 
Moderator: 
Things that you suggested. 

0:6:1.140 --> 0:6:1.570 
P2: 
Sure. 

0:6:1.580 --> 0:6:8.470 
P2: 
Yeah, I think the main things I noticed in Umm, I sent a lot of them out because we were very short LPN stuff. 

0:6:8.480 --> 0:6:11.310 
P2: 
So trying to help the LPNS out with getting some of the reminders done. 

0:6:11.320 --> 0:6:12.620 
P2: 
I think the biggest. 

0:6:15.40 --> 0:6:27.130 
P2: 
Thing I saw was if there was a way for the incoming when the veteran completes the screen instead of having to go back to BHL, it would be nice if it just went in to see Paris automatically. 

0:6:28.560 --> 0:6:33.910 
P2: 
Umm that was a bit of a extra step and so I had sent a lot of them out. 

0:6:33.920 --> 0:6:41.690 
P2: 
So I was kind of having to go in both programs all the time and it would have been nice if it just cause ultimately you kind of just go in to be HL and push it to CPRS. 

0:6:41.700 --> 0:6:53.920 
P2: 
So if that was just automatic, then you would only have to go into CPRS and it would save one step and a lot of people in my role and in the LPNS are doing direct patient care all day long. 

0:6:53.930 --> 0:6:56.740 
P2: 
So they're always in CPRS, so that would maybe save them a little bit of time. 

0:6:57.880 --> 0:7:1.820 
P2: 
Umm, so I think that could be a great improvement. 

0:7:2.350 --> 0:7:13.170 
P2: 
Umm, because I don't believe there was any time that myself or any of the other options didn't end up pushing something through to see Piras umm, that went to BHL. 

0:7:13.180 --> 0:7:21.290 
P2: 
So it seems like kind of an unnecessary step and you would still have the opportunity to delete the note if you thought for some reason you didn't want it to be in their chart. 

0:7:22.280 --> 0:7:22.810 
P2: 
Umm. 

0:7:23.40 --> 0:7:52.10 
P2: 
And then the other feedback I had was if there's a way when that reminders come back positive, if there's a way that our local generated consults could automatically populate for the nursing staff to complete, I think that would be really helpful because that's what happens now is when we go through a reminder and it's positive, umm, the, the console kind of populates that they need to complete and that helps the LPN's in their workflow. 

0:7:52.20 --> 0:8:3.40 
P2: 
It's a lot quicker than having to dig through and find the right console, which is kind of what they had to do when they were positive through a BHL, and it sounded like from some of the meetings they were looking at at that already. 

0:8:3.750 --> 0:8:10.560 
P2: 
But that I think those would be the two biggest things that would certainly help our alpian staff to learn it a little bit easier. 

0:8:10.570 --> 0:8:15.490 
P2: 
And I think it would help us to not miss the necessary follow up. 

0:8:15.500 --> 0:8:19.80 
P2: 
We need to do when something's positive, if it kind of generated automatically. 

0:8:20.70 --> 0:8:20.270 
Moderator: 
OK. 

0:8:20.760 --> 0:8:22.330 
P2: 
If that doesn't make sense, love, you know. 

0:8:22.730 --> 0:8:24.80 
Moderator: 
No, I think that makes sense to me. 

0:8:24.570 --> 0:8:24.850 
P2: 
OK. 

0:8:25.270 --> 0:8:25.900 
Moderator: 
Yeah. 

0:8:26.730 --> 0:8:32.410 
Moderator: 
So I know you shared some of the ways to update it, but can you walk me through the final process? 

0:8:32.420 --> 0:8:38.690 
Moderator: 
So after you do this a couple times, your final process for sending, receiving and reviewing these questionnaires. 

0:8:42.350 --> 0:8:43.520 
Moderator: 
Yes, but you already, yes. 

0:8:40.750 --> 0:8:44.200 
P2: 
With what we did, yeah. 

0:8:44.210 --> 0:8:56.640 
P2: 
So we, you know, the LPN's out participated in the pilot had certain teams that they sent them out to once a week for the whole like for the follow the upcoming week. 

0:8:56.760 --> 0:9:0.720 
P2: 
And then I sent it out for a lot of the remainder of the teams. 

0:9:1.510 --> 0:9:14.470 
P2: 
And then we would receive an email when a patient had responded to the reminders that there was answers available and BHL. 

0:9:14.480 --> 0:9:33.540 
P2: 
And then you would go on to BHL and then you would hit push it over to CPRS and then you would go into CPRS and you would review the note and either sign it or take action if there's something that needs to be completed that would either be alerting the PCP or putting in. 

0:9:35.470 --> 0:9:42.510 
P2: 
The correct consult depending on whatever what might a screened positive. 

0:9:43.910 --> 0:9:44.20 
Moderator: 
Yeah. 

0:9:45.50 --> 0:9:46.780 
Moderator: 
Umm, a couple of questions based on that. 

0:9:47.150 --> 0:9:47.370 
P2: 
Yeah. 

0:9:46.790 --> 0:9:55.780 
Moderator: 
So first though it's a you sent out a lot of stuff for the other, so that's when you were sending out for other clinics when an LPN wasn't a part of the pilot. 

0:9:55.790 --> 0:9:57.760 
Moderator: 
Is that what you meant by sending out to others? 

0:9:58.520 --> 0:10:0.570 
P2: 
No, we just have a lot of different teams. 

0:10:4.480 --> 0:10:4.700 
Moderator: 
OK. 

0:10:0.620 --> 0:10:7.370 
P2: 
So I sent out to some teams and they sent out to some teams, so we kind of shared shared the team workload. 

0:10:7.380 --> 0:10:10.880 
P2: 
There was two LPNS and then myself between the three clinics. 

0:10:12.890 --> 0:10:15.210 
Moderator: 
And then you were talking about an email that was sent. 

0:10:15.220 --> 0:10:20.470 
Moderator: 
So is that the the one that came directly from the system of BHL or do you do something else email wise? 

0:10:23.950 --> 0:10:24.930 
Moderator: 
OK, that you get. 

0:10:21.330 --> 0:10:26.100 
P2: 
No, just the one we receive when a patient completes a survey. 

0:10:26.110 --> 0:10:30.170 
P2: 
Yeah, the automated one that gives you the link to go into the system. 

0:10:31.890 --> 0:10:36.550 
Moderator: 
And then you've mentioned the consults that happen at the end a couple times. 

0:10:36.700 --> 0:10:45.270 
Moderator: 
So those are really the consults that tend to not be related to the appointment that they actually have scheduled that triggered this Screener, correct? 

0:10:45.280 --> 0:10:51.270 
Moderator: 
So that's like if it would need to talk to a social worker or some other type of specialty, is that correct? 

0:10:52.620 --> 0:10:53.190 
P2: 
Yeah. 

0:10:53.200 --> 0:10:57.810 
P2: 
Yeah, but those are all things that we try to take care of the same day. 

0:10:57.820 --> 0:11:1.300 
P2: 
So they are kind of a part of them for a part of the appointment. 

0:11:4.10 --> 0:11:17.20 
P2: 
So yeah, so it would be like either place in most often the ones that I saw come through or placing a nutrition appointment for food insecurity or placing a social work console for housing and security. 

0:11:17.80 --> 0:11:18.330 
P2: 
Those are two of the main ones. 

0:11:21.800 --> 0:11:26.830 
Moderator: 
On a scale from one to five, again, one being very easy and five being very difficult. 

0:11:27.20 --> 0:11:31.190 
Moderator: 
How easy or difficult was it to actually use PHL? 

0:11:33.560 --> 0:11:38.510 
P2: 
Ah, I would say very I. 

0:11:38.560 --> 0:11:40.330 
P2: 
I mean, I think it is very easy. 

0:11:40.340 --> 0:11:45.300 
P2: 
I think it could be even easier if a few of those things were streamlined. 

0:11:45.310 --> 0:11:45.550 
P2: 
I don't. 

0:11:45.560 --> 0:11:50.580 
P2: 
That's not really number, but I'm. 

0:11:53.20 --> 0:11:53.480 
P2: 
I'm sorry. 

0:11:53.490 --> 0:11:54.950 
P2: 
What was one is very easy. 

0:11:56.530 --> 0:11:57.140 
P2: 
OK. 

0:11:55.580 --> 0:11:57.630 
Moderator: 
Yes, once daily. 

0:11:57.210 --> 0:12:2.50 
P2: 
I I guess I would say to just cause there's room for improvement. 

0:12:2.870 --> 0:12:7.330

OK, has the quality of the time well. 

0:12:9.380 --> 0:12:12.890 
Moderator: 
Quality of the time of the appointment with the patient. 

0:12:13.200 --> 0:12:16.250 
Moderator: 
Do you think that improved or worsened due to this process? 

0:12:18.520 --> 0:12:19.650 
P2: 
Umm, improved. 

0:12:20.720 --> 0:12:21.10 
Moderator: 
And why? 

0:12:21.960 --> 0:12:28.410 
P2: 
Umm, just because we often our patients show up right at the time of their appointment. 

0:12:28.420 --> 0:12:34.340 
P2: 
So a lot of the appointment can be spent doing the check in rather than spending time with their clinicians. 

0:12:34.350 --> 0:12:40.530 
P2: 
So in theory, this should improve the amount of time they get to spend there with their clinician. 

0:12:40.540 --> 0:12:41.660 
P2: 
If they're spending less time. 

0:12:43.560 --> 0:12:47.350 
P2: 
Being checked in it would be great to expand the. 

0:12:47.360 --> 0:12:50.540 
P2: 
I mean, not sure how familiar are. 

0:12:50.550 --> 0:12:59.330 
P2: 
We have a lot of reminders, like much more than a more included in this pilot, so it would be wonderful to see if there's a way to expand what we are asking. 

0:12:59.920 --> 0:13:5.420 
P2: 
The LPM still have a lot of reminders to ask in addition to the ones we're sending out, but at least it takes a little bit off their plate. 

0:13:6.350 --> 0:13:16.720 
Moderator: 
Is there any particular ones that you think would significantly help improve like the ones that you find are longer or more difficult and think could be digitized? 

0:13:16.730 --> 0:13:18.30 
Moderator: 
So what, in your opinion would you add? 

0:13:21.420 --> 0:13:28.810 
P2: 
You know, it seems like I I'd have to go through the whole list 1 by 1 to look at them. 

0:13:28.970 --> 0:13:42.50 
P2: 
I think most of them could be sent through that the biggest concern would be obviously the mental health ones and making sure that would require separate follow up process for those things that are positive. 

0:13:42.60 --> 0:13:46.230 
P2: 
So that would be something I think the whole team would have to explore. 

0:13:46.240 --> 0:13:55.930 
P2: 
It sounded like from another team that was on that call, they do use it for that, so they must have figured out, OK, this is, I believe someone out is they they figured out a way to. 

0:13:57.190 --> 0:13:59.910 
P2: 
Umm, ensure patient safety with that sort of thing. 

0:13:59.920 --> 0:14:2.950 
P2: 
So that would be something I think would be worth exploring. 

0:14:5.540 --> 0:14:12.960 
P2: 
But certainly it seems like some of the other reminders could be included too, or most of the other ones. 

0:14:15.810 --> 0:14:16.160 
P2: 
So. 

0:14:19.500 --> 0:14:23.350 
Moderator: 
How has your personal workflow been affected? 

0:14:23.360 --> 0:14:26.10 
Moderator: 
Either positive or negatively by this process. 

0:14:27.780 --> 0:14:28.750 
P2: 
Umm, I would. 

0:14:28.760 --> 0:14:35.170 
P2: 
I mean, I would and anticipate if this was rolled out that most people in my role wouldn't be sending them themselves. 

0:14:35.690 --> 0:14:46.850 
P2: 
Umm, so it was a little bit disruptive to my work day, but it was certainly still worth it because it was helpful to my team so. 

0:14:49.180 --> 0:14:53.710 
P2: 
But I would based on the feedback of my staff, it sounds like it was. 

0:14:54.200 --> 0:14:55.820 
P2: 
They were able to. 

0:14:57.420 --> 0:15:3.500 
P2: 
Process things that came through during down times throughout the day, so it wasn't too disruptive. 

0:15:7.770 --> 0:15:8.150 
P2: 
Great. 

0:15:5.250 --> 0:15:13.860 
Moderator: 
And I know we're talking to more people at your site too, but what is the feedback that you have been hearing from your team that you feel that you can share? 

0:15:15.100 --> 0:15:16.470 
P2: 
I mean, I think everyone liked it. 

0:15:16.480 --> 0:15:20.480 
P2: 
They were disappointed to hear we had to stop, so I think it was good. 

0:15:20.520 --> 0:15:26.530 
P2: 
I think it mostly it's the same same piece about if there's. 

0:15:27.810 --> 0:15:30.400 
P2: 
Ohh way to automate some of that. 

0:15:30.710 --> 0:15:31.740 
P2: 
That would be great. 

0:15:31.750 --> 0:15:38.420 
P2: 
We obviously have a lot of staff with viewing comfortability with new programs and computers and that sort of thing. 

0:15:39.230 --> 0:15:43.720 
P2: 
So anyway, we can streamline things as best as possible. 

0:15:43.730 --> 0:15:44.590 
P2: 
Then we were juice. 

0:15:44.600 --> 0:15:54.650 
P2: 
Our risk of missing something, so I think that piece would make it even better, but everyone seems to really like it. 

0:15:54.660 --> 0:15:56.990 
P2: 
Morse didn't wanna have to stop sending them out, so. 

0:15:58.20 --> 0:15:58.350 
Moderator: 
OK. 

0:15:59.160 --> 0:16:4.800 
Moderator: 
Do you feel this process maintains an appropriate level of safety and clinical integrity and why? 

0:16:7.300 --> 0:16:8.430 
P2: 
Yeah, I believe so. 

0:16:8.440 --> 0:16:15.970 
P2: 
I think that, uh, at least the opinions told me patients reported positive feedback about it. And we had a couple, we had one or two instances where a patient, it sounds like after talking to the program staff, it's a little bit of a glitch that sometimes happens, but they were screened in person, but also umm, they are reminders didn't come back till after their appointment that they had completed before the appointment. And we did see that there was a a difference. So in the one case, the patient told the person in person that he had adequate resources for food at home, but then when he was screened online, he said he didn't. 

0:16:52.960 --> 0:16:55.60 
P2: 
And then we ended up putting a social work console. 

0:16:55.70 --> 0:17:3.180 
P2: 
So like you know some, it just maybe some people feel more comfortable in answering questions. 

0:17:5.120 --> 0:17:6.510 
P2: 
Not in person. 

0:17:6.520 --> 0:17:20.540 
P2: 
More honestly, I don't know what the data really shows on that, but at least in this one example we were able to provide a patient services that we might not have been able to based on his answering of the questions in person. So. 

0:17:22.910 --> 0:17:26.440 
Moderator: 
Was there any other trends to those ones that were in the glitch? 

0:17:26.450 --> 0:17:26.800 
Moderator: 
Did they? 

0:17:28.20 --> 0:17:34.80 
Moderator: 
Were they closer to the appointment time that the veteran entered them or I don't know if you notice anything else? 

0:17:34.630 --> 0:17:35.910 
P2: 
No, it's on the step. 

0:17:35.990 --> 0:17:37.710 
P2: 
The BHL staff thought. 

0:17:37.770 --> 0:17:40.220 
P2: 
I believe it was something to do with. 

0:17:40.750 --> 0:17:45.200 
P2: 
It sometimes happens when they, when they are, don't have signal. 

0:17:45.210 --> 0:17:45.680 
P2: 
I don't know. 

0:17:45.690 --> 0:17:48.20 
P2: 
It sounded like it occasionally happens. 

0:17:48.90 --> 0:17:48.890 
P2: 
I'm not quite sure. 

0:17:49.650 --> 0:17:50.20 
Moderator: 
OK. 

0:17:50.380 --> 0:17:53.310 
Moderator: 
And how often do you remember that happening? 

0:17:55.590 --> 0:17:55.790 
Moderator: 
OK. 

0:17:53.560 --> 0:17:55.880 
P2: 
I think it was just one or two so. 

0:17:59.100 --> 0:18:3.980 
Moderator: 
Now you kind of talked about this a little bit, but was your data entry simple side? 

0:18:6.500 --> 0:18:6.780 
P2: 
Yeah. 

0:18:9.760 --> 0:18:10.270 
P2: 
Yeah. 

0:18:10.280 --> 0:18:12.280 
P2: 
I mean, it's still. 

0:18:14.700 --> 0:18:15.630 
P2: 
Yes, it was. 

0:18:15.640 --> 0:18:16.120 
P2: 
It was. 

0:18:16.180 --> 0:18:18.250 
P2: 
It was nice to have the information ahead of time. 

0:18:18.260 --> 0:18:20.240 
P2: 
A few last questions to ask. 

0:18:28.300 --> 0:18:28.800 
Moderator: 
You could tell. 

0:18:20.860 --> 0:18:29.560 
P2: 
I think it could be simplified more so just with removing that step of going into the BHL platform, yeah. 

0:18:31.390 --> 0:18:36.730 
Moderator: 
Have you noticed a decrease or increase in the notifications that you receive about clinical reminders? 

0:18:40.0 --> 0:18:41.830 
P2: 
I'm definitely a lot of emails. 

0:18:44.100 --> 0:18:46.320 
P2: 
Got a lot of emails about it so. 

0:18:47.290 --> 0:18:49.30 
Moderator: 
Some more notifications than before. 

0:18:49.710 --> 0:18:51.660 
P2: 
Yeah, but it's hard. 

0:18:51.670 --> 0:18:59.120 
P2: 
It's hard because I don't typically check in patients, so I am, but they the LPN staff wouldn't really get notifications about it. 

0:18:59.130 --> 0:19:2.480 
P2: 
They would just happen when they're checking people in. 

0:19:2.840 --> 0:19:5.390 
P2: 
So yeah, some more. 

0:19:6.420 --> 0:19:6.620 
Moderator: 
OK. 

0:19:8.960 --> 0:19:13.730 
Moderator: 
And would you agree or disagree with the following statement? 

0:19:13.800 --> 0:19:16.640 
Moderator: 
Overall clinical reminder burden has been reduced. 

0:19:21.940 --> 0:19:22.460 
P2: 
Umm. 

0:19:25.850 --> 0:19:31.550 
P2: 
I I guess neutral the clinical reminders are still there and we're still doing the follow up. 

0:19:34.330 --> 0:19:37.430 
P2: 
So I don't know that the burdens really changed. 

0:19:38.150 --> 0:19:38.530 
P2: 
Umm. 

0:19:39.110 --> 0:19:48.990 
P2: 
However, I guess the way the platform works allows for some of the work to be done at other times when the clinic is less busy. 

0:19:50.720 --> 0:19:50.930 
Moderator: 
No. 

0:19:51.120 --> 0:19:54.150 
P2: 
Umm, since it allows us to have a little bit of. 

0:19:56.770 --> 0:20:8.290 
P2: 
You know, we don't have control over when the patient show up for their appointment, so it does allow us a little bit of flexibility in that and we can process some of those things at less busy times. 

0:20:8.370 --> 0:20:8.630 
P2: 
Things. 

0:20:10.500 --> 0:20:18.670 
Moderator: 
Do you think that some of your suggestions on ways to improve would impact your like the clinical reminder burden? 

0:20:22.750 --> 0:20:23.90 
Moderator: 
So like. 

0:20:22.380 --> 0:20:23.460 
P2: 
Yeah, definitely. 

0:20:23.470 --> 0:20:38.520 
P2: 
I mean, yes, yeah, definitely like the overall, I mean I think it would be, it's a different subject, but it would be great if we got our reminder list down to some a little bit. 

0:20:38.530 --> 0:20:40.670 
P2: 
There's a lot of questions in there. 

0:20:40.740 --> 0:20:41.990 
P2: 
I just had a new patient. 

0:20:42.0 --> 0:20:44.430 
P2: 
I think it took me 25 minutes to check him in. 

0:20:44.440 --> 0:20:56.90 
P2: 
He had so many clinical reminders, so it would be great to maybe simplify some of those as some of them are a little repetitive, but that's I guess, a different conversation. 

0:20:56.100 --> 0:21:0.780 
P2: 
But yes it, I mean it certainly helps I guess with the time. 

0:21:2.600 --> 0:21:3.300 
P2: 
Peace. 

0:21:6.50 --> 0:21:6.230 
Moderator: 
Yeah. 

0:21:3.540 --> 0:21:9.30 
P2: 
I think it still takes time, but it would reduce time if we can. 

0:21:9.580 --> 0:21:14.990 
P2: 
If it just automatically pushed to CPRS, and especially if the consults generated then that would help as well. 

0:21:16.190 --> 0:21:16.360 
Moderator: 
Thank. 

0:21:16.560 --> 0:21:18.660 
Moderator: 
So maybe it's more we're ohh God. 

0:21:16.600 --> 0:21:19.930 
P2: 
I found even with, oh, I was just. 

0:21:19.980 --> 0:21:24.650 
P2: 
I with the two options I did it even when there was a positive screen. 

0:21:24.720 --> 0:21:28.430 
P2: 
You know, they would ask me to come and help them to find the right consult. 

0:21:28.440 --> 0:21:43.610 
P2: 
And so I think it just kind of highlighted that we would probably rolling it out to all of the LPNS that would be tough to, we would have a lot of people needing help to try and locate the consults cause those are consults that are typically automatically generated for them. 

0:21:43.620 --> 0:21:45.810 
P2: 
So they never really have to pull them in that manner. 

0:21:48.160 --> 0:21:56.810 
P2: 
So that would definitely be a piece that would need to be improved to him to improve the burden, if that makes sense. 

0:21:57.230 --> 0:21:57.390 
Moderator: 
Yeah. 

0:21:56.950 --> 0:22:2.640 
P2: 
Otherwise it might create more work for management to help begins with that process. 

0:22:3.960 --> 0:22:13.540 
Moderator: 
And umm, so you mentioned maybe digitizing more but then also taking a look and which ones are needed in some seems very similar. 

0:22:17.640 --> 0:22:17.810 
P2: 
Yeah. 

0:22:13.550 --> 0:22:21.330 
Moderator: 
So maybe doing a critical review of the reminders, is there any particular ones that you think overlap? 

0:22:24.510 --> 0:22:28.780 
P2: 
Umm, I can't say for sure. 

0:22:28.850 --> 0:22:29.740 
P2: 
I guess that would have to. 

0:22:31.220 --> 0:22:44.220 
P2: 
Uh, look at a along look at the list of all of them, or to see I guess, how often they, how often the screens for some of them come up to. 

0:22:46.120 --> 0:22:46.420 
P2: 
So. 

0:22:51.10 --> 0:22:51.270 
Moderator: 
OK. 

0:22:49.370 --> 0:22:51.560 
P2: 
I can't say for sure right now. 

0:22:51.570 --> 0:22:53.720 
P2: 
Just got the sound my usual daily workflow. 

0:22:54.310 --> 0:22:54.840 
P2: 
But. 

0:22:54.720 --> 0:22:55.120 
Moderator: 
That's OK. 

0:22:56.270 --> 0:22:58.90 
Moderator: 
That's great. Umm. 

0:23:1.540 --> 0:23:3.550 
Moderator: 
How could be HL? 

0:23:3.560 --> 0:23:9.940 
Moderator: 
I know you gave a couple ideas of ways to improve, but do you have any other suggestions on how the tools might be improved or changed? 

0:23:12.400 --> 0:23:20.170 
P2: 
No, I think just, I mean things, anything's I mentioned already it it seem it's very user friendly. 

0:23:21.530 --> 0:23:22.70 
P2: 
Umm. 

0:23:22.860 --> 0:23:25.650 
P2: 
And it seems like it's easy for the patients to understand. 

0:23:25.660 --> 0:23:29.890 
P2: 
It seemed like a decent amount of patients responded. 

0:23:29.900 --> 0:23:36.100 
P2: 
So, and everyone seemed to in general have positive feedback patient wise, so I think. 

0:23:39.10 --> 0:23:40.930 
P2: 
Nothing else other than what I already mentioned. 

0:23:42.70 --> 0:23:50.980 
Moderator: 
If you could put a time like create a time estimate on how much time has been saved, if any, by collecting these reminder responses, what would that be? 

0:23:53.690 --> 0:23:53.930 
P2: 
Umm. 

0:23:54.100 --> 0:23:56.210 
Moderator: 
Maybe like power appointment or? 

0:23:56.100 --> 0:23:56.340 
P2: 
Yeah. 

0:23:57.630 --> 0:24:4.300 
P2: 
Uh, it'd be, you know, some people just had one reminder do, and some people had a bunch. 

0:24:4.310 --> 0:24:11.590 
P2: 
So probably for the ones who had, because we really only sent it out for a handful probably 5 minutes at the most, and then. 

0:24:13.340 --> 0:24:17.150 
P2: 
Less than a minute for the 1/2 just had like one do or something. 

0:24:17.870 --> 0:24:18.150 
Moderator: 
OK. 

0:24:19.620 --> 0:24:20.250 
Moderator: 
And you mentioned. 

0:24:19.530 --> 0:24:23.720 
P2: 
But certainly for a 30 minute appointment slot that makes a difference, so. 

0:24:25.430 --> 0:24:34.760 
Moderator: 
You mentioned a bunch of ways to improve or change, but if you can only pick one, what would be that one thing about this process that you would wanna change? 

0:24:36.800 --> 0:24:37.710 
P2: 
Yeah, great question. 

0:24:37.720 --> 0:24:45.420 
P2: 
I think probably just from a management viewpoint, probably the automation of the consults would be. 

0:24:47.10 --> 0:24:57.870 
P2: 
Umm my biggest priority to make sure that things don't positive screens don't get missed. Umm. 

0:25:1.980 --> 0:25:3.60 
P2: 
Would probably be the biggest thing. 

0:25:6.50 --> 0:25:9.240 
Moderator: 
And is there anything else that we haven't talked about that you would like to share? 

0:25:11.270 --> 0:25:13.130 
Moderator: 
About the complementary. 

0:25:11.320 --> 0:25:14.220 
P2: 
No, nothing else that I can think of. 

0:25:14.230 --> 0:25:14.720 
P2: 
I think it was. 

0:25:16.890 --> 0:25:20.570 
P2: 
Seemed great, but looking forward to trying the next one too.
