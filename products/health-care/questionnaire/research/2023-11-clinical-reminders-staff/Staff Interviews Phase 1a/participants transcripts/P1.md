Tool: BHL 

0:0:0.0 --> 0:0:1.500 
Moderator:  
You know, start on my side. 

0:0:5.30 --> 0:0:11.400 
Moderator:  
The first group of questions that I actually have for you are all about learning the tool and how that process went. 

0:0:12.100 --> 0:0:12.500 
P1: 
Yeah. OK. 

0:0:12.110 --> 0:0:20.840 
Moderator:  
So first on a scale from one to five, with one being very easy and five being very difficult. 

0:0:21.50 --> 0:0:24.170 
Moderator:  
How easy or difficult was it to learn how to use BHL? 

0:0:26.710 --> 0:0:26.950 
Moderator:  
OK. 

0:0:24.760 --> 0:0:27.430 
P1: 
Like a 1.5, it's pretty easy. 

0:0:27.440 --> 0:0:27.880 
P1: 
It's. 

0:0:27.890 --> 0:0:34.40 
P1: 
Yeah, I mean ohh the the only part where it gets tricky is when you're setting up the clinical packages. 

0:0:34.550 --> 0:0:34.820 
Moderator:  
Umm. 

0:0:34.530 --> 0:0:40.410 
P1: 
But when you have somebody that knows how to do it, walk you through, it wasn't that hard so. 

0:0:39.960 --> 0:0:42.10 
Moderator:  
OK, what made that part slightly difficult? 

0:0:42.490 --> 0:0:44.180 
P1: 
Walk us like ohm. 

0:0:46.370 --> 0:0:46.500 
P1: 
The. 

0:0:48.310 --> 0:0:59.730 
P1: 
Trying to work, it's been so long since I didn't, but when you set up when you had the I was having a hard time the first time adding ohh the clinic names. 

0:1:0.260 --> 0:1:9.30 
P1: 
They're the packed names into my clinic screening, but I didn't have access the first time and so someone had to go back and fix that. 

0:1:9.140 --> 0:1:14.430 
P1: 
And once that was in, the only took me like 30 seconds to figure out how to do it. 

0:1:14.990 --> 0:1:15.350 
Moderator:  
OK. 

0:1:14.740 --> 0:1:16.230 
P1: 
It's pretty intuitive. 

0:1:16.240 --> 0:1:21.840 
P1: 
Yeah, it it just took a second cause like it didn't work right the way it was supposed to the first time. 

0:1:21.850 --> 0:1:24.680 
P1: 
And so I thought it was operator error, but it wasn't. 

0:1:24.900 --> 0:1:25.690 
Moderator:  
And something just wasn't. 

0:1:24.690 --> 0:1:26.800 
P1: 
It turns out I right. 

0:1:27.400 --> 0:1:27.680 
Moderator:  
OK. 

0:1:28.730 --> 0:1:31.780 
Moderator:  
And how long did it take you to learn to use the tool? 

0:1:33.720 --> 0:1:34.160 
P1: 
Minutes.I mean, because then all you do is once you have your clinics in, then you determine what screenings you're sending.And then you just add it and send them and it was, I mean it was. 

0:1:48.830 --> 0:1:50.290 
P1: 
I really liked using it. 

0:1:51.460 --> 0:1:51.630 
Moderator:  
Hey. 

0:1:53.470 --> 0:1:57.30 
Moderator:  
Can you summarize the training that was provided to you? 

0:1:57.650 --> 0:2:4.430 
P1: 
So we had a it was like a PowerPoint presentation meeting thing over teams. And was it John Lauser.I think is his name. 

0:2:8.870 --> 0:2:9.10 
Moderator:  
Yeah. 

0:2:8.710 --> 0:2:19.760 
P1: 
He went over all the stuff and uh and then when I got hands on uh, I had, uh, one of my colleagues with me. 

0:2:19.830 --> 0:2:22.260 
P1: 
Help me because she was also Delinda. 

0:2:24.400 --> 0:2:24.660 
Moderator:  
Umm. 

0:2:22.270 --> 0:2:49.940 
P1: 
She was one of the other people that was using it in a different clinic and we sort of figured it out, but it was, I mean it like you have the training that was like ohh half hour or 45 minute teams thing and a lot of it wasn't just how to use the tool, it was about the tool and what it's gonna be for and all this other information but the the training to actually use it didn't take that long and then. 

0:2:52.470 --> 0:2:54.550 
P1: 
Yeah, it was like step by step. 

0:2:54.560 --> 0:3:1.60 
P1: 
There were slides like how to add your clinic packs and then how to determine your screenings. 

0:3:1.70 --> 0:3:1.970 
P1: 
It was super easy. 

0:3:3.290 --> 0:3:3.940 
Moderator:  
OK. 

0:3:4.240 --> 0:3:9.660 
Moderator:  
And you did say when you did run into problems after that training, you kind of like met with somebody at your facility. 

0:3:9.940 --> 0:3:10.220 
P1: 
Yeah. 

0:3:9.910 --> 0:3:17.290 
Moderator:  
Was there any any need to reach out to the team and ask questions to do that happen throughout? 

0:3:17.220 --> 0:3:18.990 
P1: 
That's what I did is I'm trying to. I can't remember who it was that I talked to me. Opened my team thing or I can Scroll down to our conversation cause. 

0:3:30.760 --> 0:3:31.720 
P1: 
Really sorry about this. 

0:3:33.10 --> 0:3:33.980 
Moderator:  
No, no, that's OK. 

0:3:34.470 --> 0:3:35.450 
Moderator:  
Thanks for looking this up. 

0:3:59.610 --> 0:4:0.290 
P1: 
That wasn't it. 

0:4:0.300 --> 0:4:1.970 
P1: 
I'm really sorry, I'm trying to find it. 

0:4:3.250 --> 0:4:5.70 
P1: 
Ohh April Aiello. 

0:4:6.570 --> 0:4:6.790 
Moderator:  
OK. 

0:4:7.230 --> 0:4:8.110 
P1: 
Is who I reached out to. 

0:4:7.860 --> 0:4:10.570 
Moderator:  
And it was, and it was always through teams. And that what seemed to get your responses quickly. 

0:4:13.580 --> 0:4:25.840 
P1: 
It was one question I said I'm I was getting a privacy error when I tried to log in and it was just a thing I had to close it out and then restart it and it was fine. 

0:4:27.920 --> 0:4:28.80 
P1: 
Yeah. 

0:4:27.150 --> 0:4:29.200 
Moderator:  
OK, so you literally only did that once. 

0:4:29.620 --> 0:4:30.110 
P1: 
Once. 

0:4:29.210 --> 0:4:30.620 
Moderator:  
There was no other need to reach out. 

0:4:30.340 --> 0:4:30.630 
P1: 
Yep. 

0:4:30.630 --> 0:4:31.760 
Moderator:  
It was pretty soon, OK. 

0:4:32.30 --> 0:4:33.420 
P1: 
No, I mean it was. 

0:4:33.910 --> 0:4:36.150 
P1: 
I wish video game launches with that smooth. 

0:4:37.210 --> 0:4:38.150 
P1: 
It was super easy. 

0:4:39.530 --> 0:4:45.560 
Moderator:  
If you could change one thing about onboarding or training that you received, what would it be? 

0:4:46.890 --> 0:4:55.610 
P1: 
The hands- on portion like with the training to be able to use the tool with you know as they're talking because I learned better that way. 

0:4:56.650 --> 0:4:56.930 
Moderator:  
OK. 

0:4:59.30 --> 0:4:59.430 
Moderator:  
Great. 

0:5:0.180 --> 0:5:3.890 
Moderator:  
My next set of questions are all about actually utilizing the tool now. 

0:5:4.560 --> 0:5:7.470 
Moderator:  
So can you walk me through your final process? 

0:5:7.540 --> 0:5:14.580 
Moderator:  
So maybe not the first week or so when you're still figuring things out, but can you walk me through the process of sending and receiving and reviewing these questionnaires? 

0:5:14.900 --> 0:5:46.830 
P1: 
So what I did is I Monday morning before clinic even started, I would add my packs and ship my questionnaires, you know, send them and then whenever I got an almost always if time allowed whenever I got an email saying that I'm had a response and I would review it and add it right then so that so I didn't forget you know but sometimes you're not able to and then you come back and there are like three or four of them and then you have to review them and sequence. 
But I never had to send it because I never had to refer to social work, I didn't have any problems like it was all super easy. 

0:5:59.320 --> 0:6:2.680 
Moderator:  
Can you tell me more when you sent it out, did you send out like, a week at a time? 

0:6:2.850 --> 0:6:3.330 
P1: 
Yes. 

0:6:2.690 --> 0:6:4.920 
Moderator:  
So you did it every Monday morning and you only get like. 

0:6:3.340 --> 0:6:5.760 
P1: 
Uh, sorry, yes, Monday through that week. 

0:6:5.770 --> 0:6:6.160 
P1: 
Yep. 

0:6:6.720 --> 0:6:6.990 
Moderator:  
Cool. 

0:6:6.330 --> 0:6:17.20 
P1: 
So starting for that Monday through that Friday and then the next Monday, I would do it all over again and I did it on 6 * 5 times where we're doing it something like that. 

0:6:17.30 --> 0:6:17.330 
P1: 
I don't know. 

0:6:18.760 --> 0:6:19.580 
Moderator:  
I think it would be. 

0:6:19.670 --> 0:6:22.560 
Moderator:  
It was a real like 60 days, so it's probably like six. 

0:6:23.150 --> 0:6:24.140 
P1: 
Yeah, yeah. 

0:6:22.570 --> 0:6:24.550 
Moderator:  
Yeah, six times, yeah. 

0:6:25.330 --> 0:6:30.600 
Moderator:  
Umm can you tell me more about what you said about not having problems with referring to social work? Was that because nobody needed that? 

0:6:31.760 --> 0:6:32.990 
P1: 
None of the questioners came. Yeah, nobody needed it.nIt's so like it just lucked out that everybody had reached. 

0:6:37.160 --> 0:6:38.570 
P1: 
He was like, Nope, doesn't apply. 

0:6:38.580 --> 0:6:38.790 
P1: 
Nope. 

0:6:40.60 --> 0:6:42.820 
P1: 
OK, but it saved time on the back end. There were so many questions in the screening that we didn't have to do face to face. It was pretty nice. 

0:6:50.80 --> 0:6:50.530 
Moderator:  
Great. 

0:6:55.90 --> 0:6:55.440 
P1: 
Yeah, sure. 

0:6:50.540 --> 0:7:1.890 
Moderator:  
That definitely, that's one of my later questions of, yeah, I'll, I'll bring it up later too, on a scale from one to five, with one being very easy and five being very difficult. 

0:7:2.130 --> 0:7:7.70 
Moderator:  
How easy or difficult was it to use PHL so the actual like interface? 

0:7:5.720 --> 0:7:8.530 
P1: 
One that's yeah. 

0:7:9.880 --> 0:7:13.130 
Moderator:  
And this gets my my next question gets what you were just talking about? 

0:7:13.380 --> 0:7:19.580 
Moderator:  
Has the quality of the time you spend with patients approve or worsen due to this process and why? 

0:7:19.500 --> 0:7:35.100 
P1: 
I would say improved because then you're able to spend more time face to face on stuff that's like, you know, pain or their, you know, mental health, the stuff that we can't ask through the screen for obvious reasons. 

0:7:38.30 --> 0:7:39.560 
Moderator:  
And then accounting for all the other stuff. 

0:7:39.570 --> 0:7:43.450 
Moderator:  
So like you said, like you have to check the notifications and actually send out the stuff. 

0:7:43.490 --> 0:7:46.280 
Moderator:  
So the whole workflow taking that into account. 

0:7:47.180 --> 0:7:50.740 
Moderator:  
Have your workflows been affected either positively or negatively? 

0:7:51.410 --> 0:7:53.500 
P1: 
Oh, when I was using it positively for sure. 

0:7:55.650 --> 0:7:56.210 
Moderator:  
And how? 

0:7:57.80 --> 0:8:10.490 
P1: 
Because it cut down on the time the face to face sign that we had to spend asking questions, then I was able to get stay, keep the clinics on time easier or yeah much more that way. 

0:8:12.930 --> 0:8:14.0 
Moderator:  
So you feel that? 

0:8:12.660 --> 0:8:23.750 
P1: 
Because sometimes some of these guys come in with to 15-20 reminders that we have to go through and by using that screening I can take out three or four of them. 
You know, it saves time and when you have, you know you do 15-20 intakes a day and if you can hit half those guys with the screening ahead of time, you've saved yourself many minutes. 

0:8:41.440 --> 0:8:41.890 
Moderator:  
OK. 

0:8:42.520 --> 0:8:50.270 
Moderator:  
Yeah, I do have that as a question of how much time would you estimate has been saved, if any, by collecting these clinical reminders responses prior to an appointment. 

0:8:50.280 --> 0:8:53.610 
Moderator:  
So could you could think about minutes per appointment? 

0:8:53.620 --> 0:8:54.590 
Moderator:  
Minutes per week. 

0:8:54.650 --> 0:8:56.830 
Moderator:  
What is the 10? 

0:8:55.860 --> 0:8:58.690 
P1: 
Or I would easily say that it's minutes per appointment. 

0:8:58.700 --> 0:9:3.80 
P1: 
A few, which I mean doesn't sound like a lot, but that adds up for sure. 

0:9:10.720 --> 0:9:10.860 
P1: 
Yes. 

0:9:4.260 --> 0:9:12.120 
Moderator:  
OK, so these the fact that there were six been part of this pilot made in it impact, OK. 

0:9:14.80 --> 0:9:18.530 
Moderator:  
Do you feel this process maintains an appropriate level of safety and clinical integrity? 

0:9:20.180 --> 0:9:21.150 
P1: 
I do. 

0:9:22.260 --> 0:9:30.970 
P1: 
I mean we the patients are obviously properly identified on their end because we have their contact information and it's a secure thing. 

0:9:31.20 --> 0:9:41.90 
P1: 
I mean, I we can't obviously ascertain, you know, what the patients do with it when it comes to them, if they're, you know, showing everybody on the bus or whatever. 

0:9:41.100 --> 0:9:48.970 
P1: 
But like it seems to work fine and I mean it's it's secure as any of the other programs or utilities that we use. 

0:9:49.270 --> 0:9:51.120 
P1: 
You know, on our computers here. 

0:9:51.270 --> 0:9:52.490 
P1: 
So it seemed fine. 

0:9:53.240 --> 0:9:53.530 
Moderator:  
No. OK. 

0:9:55.200 --> 0:9:55.600 
Moderator:  
Umm. 

0:9:56.700 --> 0:10:2.0 
Moderator:  
And then have you noticed a decrease or increase in the notifications you receive about clinical reminders? 

0:10:2.70 --> 0:10:2.260 
Moderator:  
There's. 

0:10:4.410 --> 0:10:6.640 
P1: 
Probably a decrease because there's fewer. 

0:10:6.650 --> 0:10:7.930 
P1: 
They're done ahead of time. 

0:10:9.650 --> 0:10:10.90 
Moderator:  
Yeah. 

0:10:10.150 --> 0:10:14.940 
Moderator:  
And you're particularly talking about the ones that are in the notifications and CPS when you're commenting in that on that. 

0:10:15.70 --> 0:10:15.930 
P1: 
Correct. Yeah. 

0:10:18.760 --> 0:10:22.570 
Moderator:  
So would you agree or disagree with the following statement? 

0:10:22.800 --> 0:10:27.620 
Moderator:  
Overall clinical or clinic reminder burden has been reduced. 

0:10:28.410 --> 0:10:29.10 
P1: 
I would agree. 

0:10:32.660 --> 0:10:36.300 
Moderator:  
And then how could it be HL be improved or changed? 

0:10:37.930 --> 0:10:38.290 
P1: 
Umm. 

0:10:39.580 --> 0:10:49.220 
P1: 
Maybe if there were automated, like if it automatically sent the screenings to the patients, you know, we just like checked up on it every now and make sure everything's working right. 

0:10:49.280 --> 0:10:59.170 
P1: 
But if the appointments were somehow able to load into BHL so it would trigger sending the reminders to them automatically when their appointments get scheduled, that would be awesome. 

0:10:59.850 --> 0:11:0.70 
Moderator:  
OK. 

0:11:0.970 --> 0:11:2.510 
Moderator:  
What about on the other end? 

0:11:5.980 --> 0:11:6.350 
P1: 
See. 

0:11:2.520 --> 0:11:7.430 
Moderator:  
About the fact that you have to review them first, like once they come in. 

0:11:6.760 --> 0:11:16.120 
P1: 
But I mean, you can't really automatically load those because we have to read them to make sure if they need a second or third step. 

0:11:16.130 --> 0:11:20.570 
P1: 
Like if you know that needs to be escalated to social work or an appointment or whatever. 

0:11:24.270 --> 0:11:25.210 
P1: 
Our dear, I do? 

0:11:21.630 --> 0:11:25.830 
Moderator:  
OK, so you like to read those and BHL first before you push them over. 

0:11:27.40 --> 0:11:31.70 
P1: 
Yep, because then it then you know, because there's a is a nurse. 

0:11:31.80 --> 0:11:37.490 
P1: 
Like whatever I sign in that chart has my name on it and I wanna see it before it's in there with my stamp, you know. 

0:11:38.320 --> 0:11:38.450 
Moderator:  
I. 

0:11:40.550 --> 0:11:42.610 
Moderator:  
Any other suggestions for improvements or changes? 

0:11:43.70 --> 0:11:46.460 
P1: 
No, I mean the it's intuitive, it's quick. 

0:11:46.470 --> 0:11:48.280 
P1: 
It's yeah, it works great. 

0:11:50.560 --> 0:11:53.830 
Moderator:  
And there's no, because it comes in when you do push it. 

0:11:53.840 --> 0:11:55.890 
Moderator:  
It comes in as a historical note. 

0:11:56.690 --> 0:11:57.840 
P1: 
Correct. Yep. 

0:11:55.900 --> 0:12:0.530 
Moderator:  
Correct on the BHL so that doesn't impact check in or any other process. 

0:12:0.540 --> 0:12:1.470 
Moderator:  
And in the clinic. 

0:12:1.960 --> 0:12:2.510 
P1: 
No, ma'am. 

0:12:2.520 --> 0:12:5.860 
P1: 
Other than reducing the amount of questions we have to ask the patient. 

0:12:7.70 --> 0:12:19.180 
Moderator:  
If we were to add more screeners, is there a particular ones that you would absolutely want added or absolutely not presented to a veteran digitally? 

0:12:21.880 --> 0:12:30.600 
P1: 
No, I don't think we can add anymore because the other ones, like most of the other ones have like that's escalation thing that we have to do. 

0:12:30.610 --> 0:12:31.820 
P1: 
Like you can't ask about. 

0:12:32.920 --> 0:12:34.590 
P1: 
Ohh drinking. 

0:12:34.600 --> 0:12:42.440 
P1: 
Because if they you know, if they come back positive for alcohol, we have to, you know, we have a workflow or a person, you know, an SOP for that. 

0:12:42.450 --> 0:12:46.340 
P1: 
The same with thoughts of suicide or depression. 

0:12:46.390 --> 0:12:49.490 
P1: 
So those I wouldn't wanna present to them digitally. 

0:12:50.200 --> 0:12:50.670 
Moderator:  
OK. 

0:12:50.940 --> 0:12:51.920 
Moderator:  
Well, what's on the other ones? 

0:12:51.930 --> 0:12:53.460 
Moderator:  
Like the flu shot and. 

0:12:55.650 --> 0:12:56.230 
Moderator:  
Some of those. 

0:12:57.660 --> 0:13:3.710 
P1: 
Well then, because no, because unless they were able to like somehow put in where? 

0:13:3.720 --> 0:13:4.680 
P1: 
When? Who? 

0:13:4.690 --> 0:13:5.510 
P1: 
You know how they got? 

0:13:9.390 --> 0:13:9.580 
Moderator:  
Umm. 

0:13:5.520 --> 0:13:10.40 
P1: 
Because we have to enter that into CPRS, we have to ask them more questions like ohh I got my flu shot. 

0:13:10.50 --> 0:13:11.30 
P1: 
Well, where did you get it? 

0:13:11.100 --> 0:13:11.990 
P1: 
When did you get it? 

0:13:12.680 --> 0:13:12.920 
Moderator:  
OK. 

0:13:12.470 --> 0:13:14.500 
P1: 
Because that stuff has to be logged in there. 

0:13:20.150 --> 0:13:20.390 
P1: 
Yeah. 

0:13:16.130 --> 0:13:20.980 
Moderator:  
But if we were able to enter all of those things as well, then maybe. 

0:13:20.400 --> 0:13:21.460 
P1: 
Then that would be great. 

0:13:21.570 --> 0:13:22.510 
P1: 
That'd be fantastic. 

0:13:23.460 --> 0:13:25.420 
Moderator:  
OK, great. 

0:13:26.340 --> 0:13:27.760 
Moderator:  
Any other ones that you could think of? 

0:13:30.70 --> 0:13:31.500 
Moderator:  
That maybe we shouldn't or should. 

0:13:32.290 --> 0:13:32.720 
P1: 
Ohh. 

0:13:35.520 --> 0:13:39.880 
P1: 
No, because the housing and the food one would need to be escalated. 

0:13:39.970 --> 0:13:48.240 
P1: 
I'm just trying to think of all the reminders there are, and then there's other shots, but that's just like the flu shot, yeah. 

0:13:48.590 --> 0:13:49.690 
Moderator:  
Hey, how's it? 

0:13:49.700 --> 0:13:50.490 
Moderator:  
How's it influ? 

0:13:50.500 --> 0:13:54.550 
Moderator:  
We're actually in this pilot, I guess maybe nobody just had those out of your patients. 

0:13:55.30 --> 0:13:55.540 
P1: 
Oh no. 

0:13:55.550 --> 0:13:55.820 
P1: 
Huh. 

0:13:55.500 --> 0:13:56.650 
Moderator:  
So you didn't see any of those? 

0:13:57.440 --> 0:13:57.890 
P1: 
Ohh no. 

0:13:57.650 --> 0:13:58.400 
Moderator:  
What were the one? 

0:13:57.900 --> 0:13:59.730 
P1: 
Yeah, housing is it is cause. 

0:13:59.740 --> 0:14:0.460 
P1: 
Yes, you're right. 

0:14:1.260 --> 0:14:3.780 
P1: 
Umm, no. 

0:14:3.790 --> 0:14:10.140 
P1: 
Yeah, that's all I can think of is the the shot ones and then mental health suicide. Umm. 

0:14:13.210 --> 0:14:13.410 
P1: 
Yeah. 

0:14:14.490 --> 0:14:16.540 
Moderator:  
OK, great. 

0:14:21.10 --> 0:14:29.960 
Moderator:  
Then is there anything else that we haven't talked about today that you like, maybe took a note to bring up during this or anything? 

0:14:29.390 --> 0:14:30.140 
P1: 
Oh no. 

0:14:29.970 --> 0:14:30.630 
Moderator:  
You also want to share. 

0:14:30.150 --> 0:14:42.320 
P1: 
Other than how pleased I was in in using it like I was worried, you know, cause you used other programs you know with when I was active duty used. 

0:14:42.330 --> 0:14:44.600 
P1: 
Uh, what does that essentris? 

0:14:44.710 --> 0:14:49.60 
P1: 
That one wasn't fun, and like Altair's a pain. 

0:14:49.70 --> 0:14:50.120 
P1: 
So I was like, oh, here we go. 

0:14:50.130 --> 0:14:52.180 
P1: 
This is gonna be, you know, whatever. 

0:14:52.190 --> 0:14:53.260 
P1: 
And it worked fine. 

0:14:53.270 --> 0:14:53.850 
P1: 
It was great. 

0:14:55.180 --> 0:14:56.560 
Moderator:  
What were some of the things that? 

0:14:58.830 --> 0:15:1.730 
Moderator:  
You were concerned about there that this one solved. 

0:15:4.800 --> 0:15:6.420 
Moderator:  
With those plastic spans. 

0:15:4.710 --> 0:15:11.820 
P1: 
Well, I I was worried it was gonna be cumbersome and then that there would be push back from the patients. 

0:15:11.830 --> 0:15:13.740 
P1: 
Like, why are you blowing up my phone now? 

0:15:13.750 --> 0:15:16.550 
P1: 
A little, you know, but we never had any of that. 

0:15:17.320 --> 0:15:17.600 
Moderator:  
OK. 

0:15:19.180 --> 0:15:24.730 
Moderator:  
Is there anything else you've heard from the MSA or the rest of the pack team that you work with in regards to this? 

0:15:26.600 --> 0:15:26.910 
P1: 
No. 

0:15:24.740 --> 0:15:27.270 
Moderator:  
Any other feedback from the group? 

0:15:26.920 --> 0:15:33.430 
P1: 
Only a Delinda had a couple of questions, but it was minor stuff and she seemed to have no trouble with it. 

0:15:33.440 --> 0:15:36.680 
P1: 
Really either so like everyone seemed to happy with it. 

0:15:39.800 --> 0:15:40.510 
Moderator:  
Thank you. 

0:15:40.750 --> 0:15:40.930 
P1: 
Yeah. 

0:15:40.520 --> 0:15:42.350 
Moderator:  
Like we, that's all my questions. 

0:15:42.640 --> 0:15:42.990 
P1: 
Awesome. 

0:15:42.360 --> 0:15:49.40 
Moderator:  
So at this time I just wanna let you know though, since we're doing, you're about to actually start with the screening, correct? 

0:15:50.930 --> 0:15:51.110 
P1: 
Yes. 

0:15:55.710 --> 0:15:57.220 
P1: 
We'll do another one, sure. 

0:15:49.50 --> 0:16:0.790 
Moderator:  
So we're doing the flip and they'll do the second part that I just wanted to let you know at the end of that, we would like to do another, yeah, to that way we'll be able to compare and contrast and actually evaluate the two tools. 

0:16:1.240 --> 0:16:1.450 
P1: 
Perfect. 

0:16:0.920 --> 0:16:8.820 
Moderator:  
So just wanna give you heads up that in a couple a month or a couple of weeks we'll reach out to do and like put another meeting on the calendar. 

0:16:9.480 --> 0:16:9.920 
P1: 
You've got. 

0:16:9.160 --> 0:16:13.60 
Moderator:  
So it should just be these same questions just again with the other tool. 

0:16:13.620 --> 0:16:14.100 
P1: 
Sure. 

0:16:14.220 --> 0:16:14.590 
P1: 
Fair enough. 

0:16:15.440 --> 0:16:17.710 
Moderator:  
So, and we really appreciate you taking your time. 

0:16:18.730 --> 0:16:18.870 
P1: 
Yeah. 

0:16:19.920 --> 0:16:20.280 
P1: 
Thank you. 

0:16:17.720 --> 0:16:24.890 
Moderator:  
The time today to share your thoughts, it'll definitely help us as we, yeah, compare the tools and make sure this works for all staff and veterans. 

0:16:25.330 --> 0:16:25.530 
P1: 
Cool. 

0:16:25.420 --> 0:16:26.430 
Moderator:  
So enjoy the rest of your day. 

0:16:26.890 --> 0:16:27.920
