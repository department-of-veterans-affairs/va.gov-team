There we go. 

0:0:6.540 --> 0:0:6.910 
Moderator:  
I am. 

0:0:6.920 --> 0:0:12.20 
Moderator:  
I know that you don't have limited time, so I'm just gonna get going and then hopefully I can try and take notes for the rest. 

0:0:12.30 --> 0:0:12.950 
Moderator:  
Otherwise I have to record. 

0:0:13.820 --> 0:0:14.160 
P6:  
OK. 

0:0:17.100 --> 0:0:24.890 
Moderator:  
On a scale, so all the first, this first group of questions is going to be about the process you went through to learn the tool and to learn. 

0:0:24.900 --> 0:0:32.720 
Moderator:  
Learn this process overall, so on a scale from one to five, with one being very easy and five being very difficult. 

0:0:32.780 --> 0:0:36.690 
Moderator:  
How easy or difficult was it to learn how to use screening? 

0:0:38.190 --> 0:0:39.520 
P6:  
What were what was the scale? 

0:0:39.530 --> 0:0:41.430 
P6:  
Again, I'm sorry it got little patchy. 

0:0:41.60 --> 0:0:44.390 
Moderator:  
1 is easy, five is difficult. 

0:0:46.0 --> 0:0:52.980 
P6:  
I say one, it it was its user friendly, like to set up, and for us to use. 

0:0:55.130 --> 0:0:55.350 
Moderator:  
OK. 

0:0:57.30 --> 0:1:0.120 
Moderator:  
How long did it take you to learn to use the tool? I'd also say 1. It was. I mean, I'm also, I guess a quick learner, but I thought it was very easy to, you know, learn the ins and outs of it and how to use it properly. 

0:1:16.130 --> 0:1:16.660 
Moderator:  
Great. 

0:1:16.770 --> 0:1:19.490 
Moderator:  
Let me just check with Nina any progress on audio. 

0:1:26.450 --> 0:1:27.900 
Moderator:  
No, I don't think so. 

0:1:28.330 --> 0:1:29.20 
Moderator:  
OK. 

0:1:29.350 --> 0:1:32.390 
Moderator:  
Can you describe your on boarding process? 

0:1:36.940 --> 0:1:37.200 
Moderator:  
Yeah. 

0:1:35.100 --> 0:1:37.980 
P6:  
With the E screening right? 

0:1:37.210 --> 0:1:39.280 
Moderator:  
What steps did you go through, hmm. 

0:1:39.820 --> 0:1:45.550 
P6:  
Umm, so we we're pretty much just told we were going to try it. 
And to obviously give honest feedback. Umm, that we were gonna do it for a few weeks? so we had like this big meeting with some other PACT teams that we were gonna be doing it. 

0:2:1.450 --> 0:2:12.510 
P6:  
And the first meeting, they explained it,and then we had another meeting, I'd say maybe like 2 weeks later, and actually got kind of like a training on it. And then after that, I'd say like a week after that, then we started the process with it. 

0:2:22.40 --> 0:2:29.240 
Moderator:  
What was the process or how often would you say you had questions after that that training meeting? 

0:2:31.270 --> 0:2:35.380 
P6:  
I'm honestly I'd say quite a few. I mean, I am one of the AMSA, so I don't do the rooming like I don't do like the questionnaire, the screenings or clinical tasks like whatever. so I was the one that sent it out, but I noticed a lot of like the LPN's who do the rooming. 

0:2:53.710 --> 0:2:55.80 
P6:  
There was issues with getting it to sign off. And getting it uploaded to 
When we save it to save the Vista, it would automatically check out the appointment. 

0:3:21.60 --> 0:3:29.840 
P6:  
So  my team, I waited until I saw that they checked in, but even after. I tell the LPN that they're checked in and I'm gonna upload the E screening, it checks them out, but for someone,  in the beginning of the day, and their routine was,  we have this many today, I'm going to upload them, and then there are issues. 
So I think in the beginning of learning it, there were a lot of questions, and get I think there was a question and like issues with getting it to link or getting the proper encounter. I think there was a fairly good amount of questions, I'd say. 

0:4:11.940 --> 0:4:16.610 
Moderator:  
Can you tell me more about getting like the problem of getting it to sync to the proper encounter? Do you have any more details on that? 

0:4:18.720 --> 0:4:19.790 
P6:  
I don't know. That's something one of the other LPN's. She was more so, bringing up and trying to get it fixed, instead of like all of us coming in, and giving multiple answers everywhere [to everyone]. 

0:4:31.600 --> 0:4:36.340 
P6:  
It was like it we were trying to come in like 1, I guessSo it didn't get kind of oh scrambled all over the place Umm, but I don't know the extent of how it was fixed. or I'd have to go back and we have like a teams group chat, I'd have to go back like I don't know. 

0:4:51.570 --> 0:4:56.820 
P6:  
I think what we were doing this like two months or something, but I'm sure I have it in there, I can find it. If you really need me to. 

0:5:2.930 --> 0:5:12.860 
Moderator:  
What was happening though, with it and like, not necessarily how it was solved, so when you push the note over, it was creating a whole other appointment for this veteran. Is that what was happening? 

0:5:14.600 --> 0:5:16.870 
P6:  
Not a whole another appointment. I think just having to sign it twice. you'd have to like put it, save it through the eScreening website, and having to save to Vista; and then I think whenever they go to actually room, then they had to bring up the other clinical screening reminders [within CPRS]. 

0:5:38.910 --> 0:5:42.350 
Moderator:  
within CPRS? 

0:5:45.940 --> 0:5:49.720 
Moderator:  
We’re going to go back, we're going to finish the learning about the tool. 

0:5:49.840 --> 0:5:54.920 
Moderator:  
If you could change one thing about onboarding or training that you received, what would it be? 

0:6:1.60 --> 0:6:1.770 
P6:  
I'm not sure. I don't really think anything with the on boarding per se. 

0:6:8.320 --> 0:6:13.420 
Moderator:  
OK, so now we'll go to all these other questions about actually utilizing the tool. 

0:6:14.30 --> 0:6:30.500 
Moderator:  
So can you walk me through your final process so you know not the first couple weeks when you were working out the kinks of this whole thing, but the final process that you have for sending and receiving, and it sounds like the LPN's not you or reviewing. So what was your final process? 

0:6:33.770 --> 0:6:40.610 
P6:  
My final process was just save on the eScreening website just to click, you know, make sure it's saved to VistA. 

0:6:43.310 --> 0:6:53.40 
Moderator:  
So that was you made sure they were from going off of what you talked about earlier, as soon as they checked in, then you saved it to Vista. 

0:6:54.230 --> 0:7:19.660 
P6:  
Yes, just to make sure that we knew that they checked in, because if know that morning of, for those who did complete them, if I saved all of them to Vista, then it would show everyone's checked out, and you can't go back, to undo the checking or anything. They're checked out, and when they're actually checked in, you don't see it.  so it's obviously then it's extra, extra work for the LPN to have to keep going in and out, in and out, to see if they're out in the waiting room. 

 

 

0:7:34.420 --> 0:7:39.410 
Moderator:  
And then can you tell me a little bit more about your create creating the screeners? So did you do it like once a week, Daily? what was your process for checking the appointments and creating? 

0:7:47.660 --> 0:7:57.0 
P6:  
I sent them out once a week. so I would sign in to actually send out for the veterans once a week. And it just kind of varied on when I sent it out.  
My provider took some time off, so like I couldn't say I sent it out every Friday,  cause  his schedule kind of bounces around, so I didn't have anything like set like every Tuesday or anything. I tried to get either the beginning or the end of the week, just so they were sent out, and they were done with. But yet we didn't get a lot of responses anyways, so I mean, I would go in periodically throughout the week, of for those appointments to see if anyone else completed them.  

0:8:39.820 --> 0:8:43.360 
P6:  
Umm, but yeah, that's that's pretty much. 

0:8:42.800 --> 0:8:46.290 
Moderator:  
Did you try to give like veterans at least a week Or always at least a couple days. What was your gauge there for them? 

0:8:49.850 --> 0:8:51.380 
P6:  
I would send it out a week prior to their appointment. 

0:8:56.920 --> 0:9:7.210 
Moderator:  
So on a scale, again from one to five, one being very easy, 5 being very difficult, how easy or difficult was it to use he screen? 

0:9:11.130 --> 0:9:11.600 
Moderator:  
Yes. 

0:9:9.330 --> 0:9:12.720 
P6:  
Like the website you mean, I'd say. 

0:9:12.30 --> 0:9:15.50 
Moderator:  
Yeah, not the whole process, but like the actual tool itself. 

0:9:15.910 --> 0:9:17.50 
P6:  
I'd say one. 

0:9:17.120 --> 0:9:17.830 
P6:  
Yeah, it was. 

0:9:17.880 --> 0:9:18.340 
P6:  
It was easy. 

0:9:20.180 --> 0:9:33.770 
Moderator:  
And umm, with any I I think this might be second hand from if you heard anything from LPN, did the quality of the time spent with veterans improve or worsen due to this process and life? 

0:9:34.640 --> 0:9:35.450 
P6:  
Worsen, because they so like for example, the LPN told me this that she has to go through all these other screening questions, or clinical reminders, that they have to do. Escreening only hit  2 or 3 clinical reminders Where, and also, I believe it was the toxic exposure, that that veteran completed, and it was a negative result. She still had to go through. It was still having her go through and ask it and document it again. So  whatever they the clinical reminder that was sent to the veteran, didn't always get taken off the clinical reminder and their chart. So then the LPN is just going through everything again anyways. 

0:10:33.300 --> 0:10:38.40 
Moderator:  
Hey, did that happen more than once, or was that just like, a one time thing that happened? 

0:10:38.610 --> 0:10:40.330 
P6:  
That was a more than once deal. 

0:10:40.740 --> 0:10:44.640 
Moderator:  
That's was it always toxic exposure or was it other ones as well? 

0:10:45.120 --> 0:10:47.590 
P6:  
I believe it was just the toxic exposure. but along with what? Escreening what  
The clinical reminders that we sent out ?I asked her what else that they have to ask and you know she has to ask about the alcohol intake and exposure, whatever ACOVE and immunizations like with E screening, I'm sure immunization isn't really like ideal to add on there anyways, but it's just like to the point that it's still more work for them to have to. Go through. I mean, they just go through it all again anyways. 

0:11:20.600 --> 0:11:21.890 
Moderator:  
Did they say anything about Like if we added more, then, this would be beneficial. 

0:11:26.630 --> 0:11:31.900 
P6:  
Umm honestly, I would not say it would be in the sense of we also did not have a great turn out, so it's more so like she's doing it anyways, than not doing it. 

0:11:44.620 --> 0:11:47.910 
Moderator:  
OK, how about your workflow? Has your work flow been affected either positively or negatively and? 

0:11:58.970 --> 0:12:13.600 
P6:  
I wouldn't really say anything like positive or negative, just the sense of having to keep going in there to make sure, if someone completed, it like a little bit later than the last time I logged into the website. 
I don't know if this is like going off course, but like something that kind of bothered me with the website, is that there were appointments that didn't like, so something that I sent out like 2 weeks ago, it still shows as the report on there. I wish that after their appointment was done it, after that week, they would just disappear. 
Or else you're just scrolling and scrolling and you know it just it gets to be kind of annoying, and the appointments are not in order of date and time. 

0:12:50.320 --> 0:12:53.230 
Moderator:  
OK, what is the order that you see the sort order? 

0:12:54.20 --> 0:12:55.690 
P6:  
I'm gonna look real quick I believe it might be alphabetical. 
So it looks like it actually goes by when. Yeah, it goes by when it was actually sent out. So the day that I sent it to them. 

0:13:42.240 --> 0:13:47.940 
Moderator:  
But ideally it sounds like you want it by appointment, like date and time, to review it. 

0:13:47.870 --> 0:13:48.860 
P6:  
Yeah, that. 

0:13:48.870 --> 0:14:6.780 
P6:  
Yeah, that would make a lot more sense cause so then like sit, I mean, we did have a few this week and I had to write it all out and like I had to print it out and then cross off to make sure I didn't like double write down a time. 

0:14:7.70 --> 0:14:12.840 
P6:  
But to write down like in order so I knew like OK, I need to go in at this time. 

0:14:12.850 --> 0:14:14.500 
P6:  
And this time they're like upload. 

0:14:14.710 --> 0:14:29.20 
P6:  
And that was that created more work for me, so I I would say that would be a negative because it just was scrambled and it's just like double, triple, quadruple and checking to make sure I have every one written down an accounted for. 

0:14:29.810 --> 0:14:30.300 
Moderator:  
Yeah. 

0:14:30.310 --> 0:14:31.230 
Moderator:  
So you just knew. 

0:14:38.30 --> 0:14:38.410 
P6:  
Correct. 

0:14:39.500 --> 0:14:40.100 
P6:  
Correct. Yeah. 

0:14:33.910 --> 0:14:41.770 
Moderator:  
So that I can help you determine when I push it to CPRS you looked at their appointment time, did you OK? 

0:14:41.920 --> 0:14:48.110 
Moderator:  
So it's not like, umm, you physically saw them came in and then would do it. 

0:14:52.60 --> 0:14:52.470 
P6:  
So I. 

0:14:48.120 --> 0:14:54.190 
Moderator:  
Your trigger is that that list of oh, I'm trying to go ahead. 

0:14:58.430 --> 0:14:58.770 
Moderator:  
Umm. 

0:14:54.700 --> 0:15:3.710 
P6:  
I would check our scheduling like system to see if they checked in and I would write down as the. 

0:15:3.720 --> 0:15:14.90 
P6:  
You know, I would check every day to see if anyone else completed their E screening, but as each day went on like for the day prior. 

0:15:14.180 --> 0:15:18.110 
P6:  
So like today I would write down for tomorrow and write down. 

0:15:18.120 --> 0:15:21.350 
P6:  
OK, so tomorrow the 9:45 did it. 

0:15:25.180 --> 0:15:25.380 
Moderator:  
OK. 

0:15:21.580 --> 0:15:31.660 
P6:  
The 11:15 did it or, you know, like just to remind myself, and I put it on a sticky note to remind myself as if they checked in for me to upload it. 

0:15:40.630 --> 0:15:40.870 
Moderator:  
Yeah. 

0:15:31.750 --> 0:15:41.290 
P6:  
That's what I did, but that's where, like on East screening it like it's just like all over the place and doesn't really make sense. 

0:15:42.300 --> 0:15:42.600 
Moderator:  
OK. 

0:15:43.630 --> 0:15:44.340 
Moderator:  
That is helpful. 

0:15:44.350 --> 0:15:45.490 
Moderator:  
That was a great explanation. 

0:15:46.770 --> 0:15:53.900 
Moderator:  
So do you feel this process maintains an appropriate level of safety and clinical integrity? My. 

0:15:55.500 --> 0:15:56.200 
P6:  
Alarm. 

0:15:59.130 --> 0:15:59.680 
P6:  
I don't know. I would say maybe no, to be honest with you. Because A part of me sometimes thinks that when it's, it's like a screening on someones phone, they're just clicking, clicking, clicking and they're not really reading it or like a few of them would start it and it would say incomplete. So if that incomplete means like if they started it and they just didn't finish it. 

0:16:25.420 --> 0:16:38.820 
P6:  
So I don't know if that's like they get upset about that or I don't know how it works on there and where say if they put down their phone for so long, does it lock them out.   
                    

0:16:44.230 --> 0:16:50.50 
P6:  
Logged in where someone could then access that you know, like I I don't know. 

0:16:50.60 --> 0:16:52.510 
P6:  
Like on their end, really, I guess. 

0:16:52.530 --> 0:16:52.670 
Moderator:  
Like. 

0:16:52.520 --> 0:16:53.460 
P6:  
Like what to expect? 

0:16:54.530 --> 0:16:54.830 
Moderator:  
OK. 

0:16:56.890 --> 0:16:57.290 
Moderator:  
Umm. 

0:16:59.230 --> 0:17:7.220 
Moderator:  
Was well this I think might be for more LPN, but I'll ask you what is your data entry simplified and how? Or you heard anything from the LPN's about their data entry. 

0:17:14.260 --> 0:17:16.30 
P6:  
I don't think so. Just because of the sense that they're still, she was still asking cause things weren't getting cleared off. So she could sign in CPRS after I uploaded it, but it wasn't taking off for the clinical reminder even when she would do the refresh in CPRS.  
 So I mean it was, it was still more work for her. 

0:17:38.880 --> 0:17:41.990 
Moderator:  
Would you agree or disagree with the following statement? Overall clinical reminder burden has been reduced. 

0:17:46.710 --> 0:17:47.260 
P6:  
Disagree. 

0:17:49.150 --> 0:17:56.820 
Moderator:  
And then how much time would you estimate has been added or saved by collecting these clinical reminder responses prior to the appointment? 

 

0:17:58.180 --> 0:18:0.460 
P6:  
I definitely say added, I wouldn't say it decreased honestly at all, I'd say more so added On an average, I'd say maybe like for when they did it. With totaling between what I'm doing and what the LPN's doing. Honestly, I'd say at least half an hour. I mean adding half an hour like just like. 

0:18:26.130 --> 0:18:29.530 
Moderator:  
To like a week or two, OK. 

0:18:28.510 --> 0:18:30.630 
P6:  
Yeah, I yeah, yeah. 

0:18:30.640 --> 0:18:30.930 
P6:  
Yeah. 

0:18:30.940 --> 0:18:40.470 
P6:  
Just like saying in the sense of like from me sending them out, me going in and, you know, writing down the times to make sure I remember to upload them. 

0:18:40.820 --> 0:18:51.120 
P6:  
Her rooming each veteran and like asking each question, I mean, I would say it's at least half an hour to 45 minutes with all that combined and one lump sum. 

0:18:51.470 --> 0:18:55.280 
P6:  
I I mean I it's it's it. 

0:18:55.290 --> 0:18:56.270 
P6:  
It's adds more work. 

0:18:56.990 --> 0:18:57.420 
Moderator:  
OK. 

0:18:57.550 --> 0:18:57.750 
Moderator:  
Yeah. 

0:18:59.620 --> 0:18:59.780 
P6:  
Yeah. 

0:18:57.760 --> 0:19:2.640 
Moderator:  
I just want to clarify the time cause like 30 minutes a month it's different than 30 minutes a week or day, right? 

0:19:2.120 --> 0:19:2.720 
P6:  
Oh yeah. 

0:19:2.730 --> 0:19:3.500 
P6:  
I'm so sorry. Yeah. 

0:19:5.440 --> 0:19:9.410 
Moderator:  
Umm, how could he screening be improved or changed? 

0:19:12.50 --> 0:19:13.280 
P6:  
Improved, I would. 

0:19:13.890 --> 0:19:23.660 
P6:  
Excuse me, I would say what I added a little bit ago with how it lines up on the entry with date and time. it would be nice if it for those who did complete it, that would come up like first and then it would go by appointment date or time and then it would go to incomplete and then. 

0:19:42.520 --> 0:19:42.700 
Moderator:  
Yeah. 

0:19:38.850 --> 0:19:42.780 
P6:  
Like clean where you you know, that means that you sent it out and they received it. 

0:19:53.710 --> 0:19:53.990 
Moderator:  
OK. 

0:19:43.490 --> 0:19:55.70 
P6:  
Umm that I would say that would be very helpful in the like in the future or for someone else who would use it. 

0:19:56.0 --> 0:19:57.630 
P6:  
But yeah, I I don't know. 

0:19:57.640 --> 0:20:1.300 
P6:  
I I don't think it's something for Butler to necessarily use. 

0:20:1.370 --> 0:20:1.500 
P6:  
This. 

0:20:2.480 --> 0:20:10.640 
Moderator:  
And then you said the encounter thing was fixed, though the encounter problem over the course of the pilot was corrected, though. 

0:20:11.730 --> 0:20:12.900 
P6:  
I believe so. 

0:20:12.910 --> 0:20:14.620 
P6:  
I'm I'm not positive. 

0:20:14.930 --> 0:20:15.170 
Moderator:  
OK. 

0:20:14.670 --> 0:20:18.790 
P6:  
More teams had more responses than we did. 

0:20:26.30 --> 0:20:26.410 
Moderator:  
Hmm. 

0:20:19.470 --> 0:20:38.890 
P6:  
Umm my team not that all of them are homeless, but we're part of the H pack, so we have, you know, some homeless vets who, you know, not all of them have phones or want phones or, you know, umm, so I don't I I honestly don't know. 

0:20:38.900 --> 0:20:41.740 
P6:  
I think someone else from another team would know better. 

0:20:42.850 --> 0:20:43.130 
Moderator:  
OK. 

0:20:44.340 --> 0:20:44.660 
Moderator:  
And then? 

0:20:47.270 --> 0:20:48.580 
Moderator:  
You you mentioned a couple things. 

0:20:48.590 --> 0:20:50.130 
Moderator:  
So there was a problem with the encounters. 

0:20:50.140 --> 0:21:0.830 
Moderator:  
There was problem with check in and the sort order, but if you could just pick one of those things about this whole digital clinical reminder process to change, what would it be? 

0:21:2.140 --> 0:21:4.210 
P6:  
Definitely the whole check in issue. 

0:21:6.790 --> 0:21:6.960 
Moderator:  
OK. 

0:21:9.720 --> 0:21:9.940 
Moderator:  
3. 

0:21:9.500 --> 0:21:10.260 
P6:  
Or check out. 

0:21:10.270 --> 0:21:11.700 
P6:  
I'm sorry the check in check out. 

0:21:13.760 --> 0:21:20.280 
Moderator:  
Now, is there anything else that we haven't talked about and I haven't asked you about that you wanted to share with me today? 

0:21:21.850 --> 0:21:22.460 
P6:  
Umm. 

0:21:26.490 --> 0:21:26.910 
P6:  
Let's see. 

0:21:26.960 --> 0:21:28.10 
P6:  
He. 

0:21:32.120 --> 0:22:3.30 
P6:  
I guess maybe the only other thing is like for, I just thought of for an improvement with E screening is if obviously if like you have access to upload, if someone did cancel or no show, it would be nice to be able to delete their response and their or you know like with the whole like you know if it was the toxic exposure screening or the you know suicide risk screening or anything like that. 

0:22:3.940 --> 0:22:7.910 
P6:  
Just so it's not like hanging out in there. Umm. 

0:22:10.200 --> 0:22:18.890 
P6:  
But I mean other than that, I honestly I I don't think I've heard one really like good thing about E screening. 

0:22:19.370 --> 0:22:19.550 
Moderator:  
And. 

0:22:19.20 --> 0:22:24.120 
P6:  
 

0:22:24.560 --> 0:22:24.780 
Moderator:  
Umm. 

0:22:24.880 --> 0:22:25.580 
P6:  
Umm. 

0:22:25.900 --> 0:22:39.0 
P6:  
And at least my team did not even have a good turn out with how many patients the provider saw to how many people filled it out was pretty minimal.  

0:22:38.800 --> 0:22:39.150 
Moderator:  
Yeah. 

0:22:46.30 --> 0:22:46.500 
P6:  
Correct. 

0:22:46.510 --> 0:22:47.100 
P6:  
Yeah. 

0:22:39.160 --> 0:22:47.500 
Moderator:  
So the ratio of people responding, we need to be higher and you would need more clinical reminders in there to make it worth while, OK. 

0:22:47.190 --> 0:22:49.510 
P6:  
And for the clinical reminders that even like. 

0:22:51.360 --> 0:22:54.760 
P6:  
Register that they were completed by the veteran. 

0:22:56.370 --> 0:22:56.550 
Moderator:  
Yeah. 

0:22:57.970 --> 0:22:58.350 
Moderator:  
Umm. 

0:23:0.600 --> 0:23:4.40 
Moderator:  
You said there were some learning question I had in my head that and I lost it. 

0:23:4.100 --> 0:23:7.160 
Moderator:  
Let's see if it comes back. Ah. 

0:23:9.70 --> 0:23:10.230 
Moderator:  
No. Well. 

0:23:10.500 --> 0:23:10.610 
P6:  
I. 

0:23:12.330 --> 0:23:25.560 
Moderator:  
Ohm to let you know too, since this is a we're hoping to do what's called a crossover study is that you should be getting, I think, training soon on the other tool BHL. 

0:23:25.370 --> 0:23:25.590 
P6:  
OK. 

0:23:26.430 --> 0:23:31.220 
Moderator:  
And then we would hope to do these interviews again with you. 

0:23:31.940 --> 0:23:32.250 
P6:  
OK. 

0:23:31.290 --> 0:23:34.140 
Moderator:  
So again, it'll be like 20-30 minute interview. 

0:23:35.190 --> 0:23:35.470 
P6:  
OK. 

0:23:34.150 --> 0:23:37.580 
Moderator:  
Actually it's very similar what you just said today about the other tool. 

0:23:40.440 --> 0:23:40.710 
P6:  
OK. 

0:23:37.590 --> 0:23:43.0 
Moderator:  
So we can compare and contrast the experience and to see if anything's changed or improved or gotten worse. 

0:23:43.30 --> 0:23:44.150 
P6:  
OK, OK. 

0:23:43.700 --> 0:23:46.880 
Moderator:  
I'm at the end of that crossover time period. 

0:23:47.200 --> 0:23:47.670 
P6:  
OK. 

0:23:48.560 --> 0:23:56.830 
P6:  
Yeah, I one thing I would also like to bring up, I don't really know if this even like deals with like the interview portion of it or like bringing it up. 

0:23:57.380 --> 0:23:59.150 
P6:  
That's where someone I know. 

0:24:2.380 --> 0:24:2.590 
Moderator:  
Umm. 

0:23:59.160 --> 0:24:29.560 
P6:  
Someone else had an interview last week and you know we I feel like us who were piloting it didn't get great communication with like in the sense of when it's gonna be done or I guess that was the big issue as when it was gonna be done because some people didn't send out, you know, at first we were told at least that I remember was early to mid January that we were gonna be done with it. 

0:24:29.910 --> 0:24:30.220 
Moderator:  
Mm-hmm. 

0:24:30.10 --> 0:24:36.930 
P6:  
So I know for me, like I personally I didn't send one out for last week's appointments because I thought. 

0:24:36.960 --> 0:24:37.410 
Moderator:  
That was. 

0:24:37.420 --> 0:24:38.760 
Moderator:  
That's correct, yeah. 

0:24:38.760 --> 0:24:48.970 
P6:  
Right for for the mid January, you know to be done and meanwhile like someone else is saying no, keep going until we tell you. 

0:24:49.300 --> 0:24:53.850 
P6:  
So we kept going until we were told, but we were never told. 

0:24:53.900 --> 0:25:6.830 
P6:  
So that's what last week, the other girl who had the interview brought it up and said Ohh, you'll we're gonna talk about it today or I don't know who she talked to or like what happened with that. 

0:25:23.350 --> 0:25:23.570 
Moderator:  
Yeah. 

0:25:6.950 --> 0:25:25.660 
P6:  
But then it was like two or three days later, and I actually had asked for someone to delete one of the entries in E screening because they no showed and the one guy, I think John John Louser, he had said please, please don't send them out anymore. 

0:25:34.30 --> 0:25:34.250 
Moderator:  
Right. 

0:25:26.550 --> 0:25:35.260 
P6:  
Umm, we're in the process of going over the next step, but like we didn't get an end date, we weren't told, you know? 

0:25:35.270 --> 0:25:45.640 
P6:  
So I I think that I would honestly say it's like a big issue is like we're not getting like really good communication with when it's supposed to end, when it's supposed to start. 

0:25:45.650 --> 0:25:50.320 
P6:  
I know, like right now, like we're still going through the works with transitioning. 

0:25:50.950 --> 0:25:51.90 
Moderator:  
Yes. 

0:25:50.330 --> 0:25:52.370 
P6:  
We got a little bit of training today for it. 

0:25:52.430 --> 0:25:53.340 
Moderator:  
Oh, good, good. 

0:25:52.900 --> 0:25:54.340 
P6:  
Umm so. 

0:25:56.590 --> 0:25:57.130 
P6:  
I but. 

0:25:55.560 --> 0:25:57.880 
Moderator:  
OK, that was like the thank you for that. 

0:25:57.890 --> 0:26:3.670 
Moderator:  
The information should come from John for throughout the second phase two he'll be the main point of contact. 

0:26:4.100 --> 0:26:4.380 
P6:  
OK. 

0:26:6.160 --> 0:26:6.480 
P6:  
OK. 

0:26:3.780 --> 0:26:7.400 
Moderator:  
I actually have a meeting with him after this so I can bring this up and share it with him. 

0:26:8.140 --> 0:26:8.400 
P6:  
OK. 

0:26:8.110 --> 0:26:10.100 
Moderator:  
Umm, share your feedback as well. 

0:26:10.210 --> 0:26:11.600 
Moderator:  
So you're at the right point. 

0:26:12.300 --> 0:26:12.590 
P6:  
OK. 

0:26:17.150 --> 0:26:17.390 
P6:  
OK. 

0:26:21.220 --> 0:26:21.520 
P6:  
OK. 

0:26:22.550 --> 0:26:22.880 
P6:  
Gotcha. 

0:26:24.790 --> 0:26:25.540 
P6:  
Gotcha. OK. 

0:26:11.610 --> 0:26:29.600 
Moderator:  
Yeah, you should have stopped the current usage and you should be training to prepare for the next which things which we want to run for approximately 60 days once it's actually you know once we say go live, I'm tell you a little more information, but any official timings and stuff should come from John. 

0:26:30.240 --> 0:26:30.690 
P6:  
OK. 

0:26:30.740 --> 0:26:32.470 
P6:  
Yeah, we didn't get like an official. 

0:26:32.480 --> 0:26:43.810 
P6:  
Like if you know like stop sending them On this date or don't send them the week of this date or you know, like just it was just like, please stop sending them. 

0:26:44.120 --> 0:26:49.230 
P6:  
You know, we're in the transition and it's like, well, we didn't know, we didn't have a date. 

0:26:49.240 --> 0:26:50.760 
P6:  
We didn't have it. 

0:26:50.770 --> 0:27:6.580 
P6:  
We were just told beginning to mid January and we didn't hear anything, so I I didn't send for like a week and then someone else said, Oh well, I'm still sending them because they didn't tell us when to stop and I was like, OK, well then I'll send out for next week. 

0:27:6.590 --> 0:27:17.760 
P6:  
So then that was like this week and then he said no, it, you know, we're in the transition and it's like, well, that just kind of would been nice to know. Bye. 

0:27:16.930 --> 0:27:18.400 
Moderator:  
I completely understand that. 

0:27:18.410 --> 0:27:19.310 
Moderator:  
Yeah, I hear that. 

0:27:19.470 --> 0:27:23.180 
Moderator:  
So it sounds like you're OK, though at this point, though, everybody OK? 

0:27:22.150 --> 0:27:23.650 
P6:  
Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

0:27:24.20 --> 0:27:25.380 
Moderator:  
OK. OK. 

0:27:25.450 --> 0:27:30.400 
Moderator:  
I will still let John know that, and I remembered my question. 

0:27:30.670 --> 0:27:39.720 
Moderator:  
So with the cancelling out like removing the reminder of somebody cancelled or something, I did hear from somebody else that I wanted to get your feedback on this. 

0:27:42.380 --> 0:27:42.620 
P6:  
Mm-hmm. 

0:27:39.990 --> 0:27:50.910 
Moderator:  
If a veteran reschedules, would it be beneficial to transfer that or have it available for some time period in the in the instances of that reschedule? 

0:27:52.180 --> 0:27:54.840 
P6:  
Umm, I don't know what it would be like on. 

0:27:56.710 --> 0:28:5.690 
P6:  
Like the computer end of it, it would be kind of nice, like if like for us, if we reschedule it, if somehow. 

0:28:15.820 --> 0:28:15.990 
Moderator:  
OK. 

0:28:8.750 --> 0:28:21.760 
P6:  
Like NE screening in the website, if you can like change the date so that you're not removing it and then it's not wasting the veteran's time to have to go through it again. 

0:28:48.130 --> 0:28:48.410 
Moderator:  
Mm-hmm. 

0:28:22.210 --> 0:28:48.830 
P6:  
So on like I just, I feel like the website needs a little bit of tweaking like in that sense I I don't think it's something for Butler to use, but like as someone who had to use it and messaging about you know excuse me removing it or issues with uploading or anything like that, it's just it it would be nice to be able to actually I guess do a little bit more what the website. 

0:28:49.780 --> 0:28:53.280 
P6:  
So I think that would help so that the veteran doesn't have to go through it again. 

0:28:53.290 --> 0:28:54.610 
P6:  
We don't have to send it out again. 

0:28:54.620 --> 0:28:57.390 
P6:  
We don't have to watch to make sure it comes back in. 

0:28:57.680 --> 0:29:4.710 
P6:  
It'd be nice if you can like change the appointment date on it for the upload if that makes any sense. 

0:29:4.720 --> 0:29:5.30 
P6:  
I don't. 

0:29:4.950 --> 0:29:5.790 
Moderator:  
That does make sense. 

0:29:8.640 --> 0:29:8.940 
P6:  
Right. 

0:29:5.800 --> 0:29:11.140 
Moderator:  
And then we have to make sure it actually connected to the right encounter and CPRS, but OK, OK. 

0:29:11.210 --> 0:29:11.650 
Moderator:  
Thank you. 

0:29:12.220 --> 0:29:12.800 
P6:  
You're welcome. 

0:29:12.550 --> 0:29:16.420 
Moderator:  
So thank you for taking the time today to talk to us and share your thoughts. 

0:29:20.800 --> 0:29:21.40 
P6:  
Umm. 

0:29:16.590 --> 0:29:23.490 
Moderator:  
Like I said, your feedback will definitely help us as we evaluate these two tools and make sure that this process works for staff and veterans. 

0:29:24.370 --> 0:29:24.610 
P6:  
OK. 

0:29:24.400 --> 0:29:27.470 
Moderator:  
So hearing your feedback of it not working is is excellent. 

0:29:27.480 --> 0:29:28.200

Thank you so much. 

0:29:28.520 --> 0:29:29.280

I'll you'll hear from me in a couple months as the end of the next phase come so close. 

0:29:37.510 --> 0:29:37.790 
P6:  
Perfect. 

0:29:38.710 --> 0:29:38.940
