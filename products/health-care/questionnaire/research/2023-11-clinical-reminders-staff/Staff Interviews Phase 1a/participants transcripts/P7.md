Directly. 

0:0:1.140 --> 0:0:7.40 
Moderator:  
If we do wanna quote you, since this is more of a like research type of study, we'll just say like staff #3 or something like that. 

0:0:8.980 --> 0:0:9.180 
OK. 

0:0:11.120 --> 0:0:19.270 
Moderator:  
Now the first series of questions are going to be all about the process you experienced learning how to use VHL. 

0:0:19.770 --> 0:0:26.50 
Moderator:  
So first on a scale from one to five, with one being very easy and five being very difficult. 

0:0:26.60 --> 0:0:29.400 
Moderator:  
How easy or difficult was it to learn how to use PHL? 

0:0:30.740 --> 0:0:31.660 
P7: 
In the very beginning. 

0:0:33.120 --> 0:0:34.370 
Moderator:  
Yes, the very beginning. 

0:0:35.110 --> 0:0:38.90 
P7: 
Umm, I would say probably a four. 

0:0:38.890 --> 0:0:40.780 
Moderator:  
Before being like pretty difficult. 

0:0:41.820 --> 0:0:42.410 
P7: 
Oh no. 

0:0:42.420 --> 0:0:42.860 
P7: 
Pretty easy. 

0:0:43.830 --> 0:0:44.50 
Moderator:  
OK. 

0:0:45.460 --> 0:0:46.50 
Moderator:  
So then with that. 

0:0:45.540 --> 0:0:47.270 
P7: 
So then like I guess like a two of them. 

0:0:47.970 --> 0:0:48.190 
Moderator:  
OK. 

0:0:50.0 --> 0:0:54.110 
Moderator:  
And how long did it take you to learn to use the tool? 

0:0:58.380 --> 0:0:59.10 
P7: 
Uh. 

0:0:58.200 --> 0:0:59.300 
Moderator:  
Like a time frame estimate. 

0:1:1.650 --> 0:1:11.860 
P7: 
Well, so I attended the meeting and then right after the meeting, you know, we went in to be BHL and we were playing with it kind of figuring out how to how to start doing it. 

0:1:12.290 --> 0:1:15.840 
P7: 
I think we kinda, I think I caught on pretty quickly. 

0:1:16.30 --> 0:1:19.460 
P7: 
I mean, so I would say probably after the first meeting. 

0:1:20.630 --> 0:1:20.950 
Moderator:  
OK. 

0:1:22.640 --> 0:1:25.150 
Moderator:  
So can you tell me a little bit more about your onboarding process? 

0:1:25.160 --> 0:1:27.170 
Moderator:  
So you had a meeting and then you just start to use it. 

0:1:27.180 --> 0:1:28.110 
Moderator:  
Was there anything else? 

0:1:28.120 --> 0:1:29.610 
Moderator:  
Any other document shared? 

0:1:30.90 --> 0:1:30.580 
P7: 
Yeah. 

0:1:29.850 --> 0:1:32.0 
Moderator:  
Umm any anything else? 

0:1:30.590 --> 0:1:38.80 
P7: 
So after after learning just to use the BHL, a lot of questions came up. 

0:1:38.90 --> 0:1:41.440 
P7: 
After that you know, so it was a little bit. 

0:1:41.450 --> 0:1:50.550 
P7: 
So it wasn't like you learned it and that it was just like smooth, you know, from that point on, I mean, a lot of questions came up about consults, a lot of. 

0:1:51.300 --> 0:1:58.20 
P7: 
Umm, so there was a lot of communication back with the team, you know, kind of how to handle these kind of things. 

0:2:1.800 --> 0:2:3.450 
P7: 
Yeah, and that help. 

0:2:4.250 --> 0:2:5.90 
Moderator:  
Yeah, sure. 

0:2:5.840 --> 0:2:6.0 
P7: 
OK. 

0:2:6.220 --> 0:2:14.740 
Moderator:  
And then if you looking back at the whole training experience could change one thing about onboarding or training, what would it be? 

0:2:18.420 --> 0:2:19.210 
P7: 
Umm. 

0:2:31.90 --> 0:2:31.310 
Moderator:  
Umm. 

0:2:20.80 --> 0:2:42.390 
P7: 
I guess if I was the trainer, I guess I would kind of try to problem solve a little bit and have answers kind of to everything that might come forward like questions and kind of address them in the beginning of the training just to save time in the future to having to communicate back and forth. 

0:2:42.440 --> 0:2:43.190 
P7: 
You know what I mean? 

0:2:43.200 --> 0:2:48.650 
P7: 
Just because we're trying to do this in a busy clinic and you know everything else going on here too. 

0:2:48.660 --> 0:2:50.910 
P7: 
So this is just another thing. 

0:2:58.830 --> 0:2:58.990 
Moderator:  
When? 

0:2:51.60 --> 0:3:0.400 
P7: 
So I think with that being said, you know, just kind of having everything out front in the beginning and maybe resources. 

0:3:0.410 --> 0:3:6.430 
P7: 
So then if we did have a question, we could look back at that paperwork can be like, Oh yeah, this is what you do, you know. 

0:3:6.550 --> 0:3:12.940 
Moderator:  
So when when you say resources, you mean some you said paperwork like can you share a little bit more of what you mean by that? 

0:3:10.920 --> 0:3:13.730 
P7: 
Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

0:3:13.900 --> 0:3:15.210 
Moderator:  
What type of resources would you want? 

0:3:17.600 --> 0:3:21.670 
P7: 
Umm, so basically answers to questions right? 

0:3:21.680 --> 0:3:27.720 
P7: 
So umm, I'm the type of learner that I always think of. 

0:3:27.730 --> 0:3:50.200 
P7: 
Like, OK, so if we're rolling out this, what if, like what if this doesn't roll out smoothly and what are some questions that might come up and and what if a veteran says that he is having some housing insecurity, but he has not ready or doesn't want to have a consult placed? 

0:3:50.210 --> 0:3:52.40 
P7: 
How do we handle those kind of things? 

0:3:52.290 --> 0:3:58.550 
P7: 
You know, so those, those are the questions that kind of came forward after we started the BHL. 

0:3:58.680 --> 0:4:5.90 
P7: 
So that was a lot of like time behind the scenes trying to figure out these answers. 

0:4:16.40 --> 0:4:16.350 
P7: 
Yeah. 

0:4:6.570 --> 0:4:16.760 
Moderator:  
And besides the housing scenario that you just shared, is there any other specific questions or scenarios that came up that you could tell us about like? 

0:4:16.360 --> 0:4:20.310 
P7: 
So, so housing insecurity, food insecurity. 

0:4:21.170 --> 0:4:24.910 
P7: 
Umm, the smoking was one. 

0:4:25.80 --> 0:4:27.700 
P7: 
You know, there was like ohh, So what do we do? 

0:4:27.760 --> 0:4:32.980 
P7: 
Like if it's positive and and for the toxic exposure. 

0:4:33.50 --> 0:4:34.800 
P7: 
So what do we do with that? 

0:4:44.910 --> 0:4:45.190 
Moderator:  
OK. 

0:4:34.810 --> 0:4:48.750 
P7: 
And and then after a while they came back and said, well, it's going to alert the clinician when they go in with the the veteran like to do the second part right of the toxic exposure. 

0:4:48.870 --> 0:4:51.410 
P7: 
But we didn't have that information in the beginning. 

0:4:52.370 --> 0:4:52.630 
Moderator:  
OK. 

0:4:52.300 --> 0:4:57.250 
P7: 
So kind of where it's at right now is Jessica, the nurse manager. 

0:4:57.260 --> 0:4:59.430 
P7: 
She had, like her own verbiage. 

0:4:59.440 --> 0:4:59.880 
P7: 
Of what? 

0:4:59.890 --> 0:5:2.570 
P7: 
She would how she would document on that. 

0:5:2.720 --> 0:5:8.790 
P7: 
She shared that with me and and then I came back to her and I said, you know, that. 

0:5:8.800 --> 0:5:19.90 
P7: 
I mean, it sounded great, but I said, but what if we just sign them as an additional signer on to that positive note, right? 

0:5:19.260 --> 0:5:28.0 
P7: 
And then the clinician looks at that and says, you know, oh, I'm getting assigned to this because right this veteran's positive for toxic exposure. 

0:5:28.10 --> 0:5:30.150 
P7: 
And I need to take care of, you know, the next step. 

0:5:30.760 --> 0:5:30.960 
Moderator:  
Yeah. 

0:5:35.320 --> 0:5:35.620 
Moderator:  
OK. 

0:5:31.580 --> 0:5:35.870 
P7: 
So I feel like that was all kind of worked out after you know what I mean. 

0:5:36.80 --> 0:5:38.410 
P7: 
It's like things are things are getting better. 

0:5:38.420 --> 0:5:40.600 
P7: 
Kind of as we kind of figure stuff out. 

0:5:42.50 --> 0:5:44.800 
Moderator:  
Yeah, it sounds like it is there. 

0:5:44.810 --> 0:5:53.360 
Moderator:  
So a lot of those what you mentioned here is kind of interpreting the results of the screeners and that that's the part you had to work through. 

0:5:53.500 --> 0:5:53.720 
P7: 
Yeah. 

0:5:53.410 --> 0:6:2.990 
Moderator:  
Was there anything that you had hoped or had questions about actually like utilizing the tool or you know using the interface or anything? 

0:6:5.160 --> 0:6:11.980 
P7: 
No, I think you know, downloading the BHL and all that, I think that was fine. Umm. 

0:6:15.0 --> 0:6:30.350 
P7: 
Umm, I don't know if this is your exact question, but one thing I think that would work better is if when you open up CPRS it would really be nice if BHL was in CPRS and could just pop open right because it's another. 

0:6:30.360 --> 0:6:33.310 
P7: 
It's another thing when you come in in the morning, right? 

0:6:33.320 --> 0:6:36.390 
P7: 
You got to open up CPRS, you got to open up this. 

0:6:36.940 --> 0:6:47.960 
P7: 
Then you got to go to BHL and you need to take care of BHL before you start seeing your patients, because those veterans might be out in your lobby, that you're going to see today, right? 

0:6:47.260 --> 0:6:48.360 
Moderator:  
OK. Yeah. 

0:6:48.30 --> 0:6:49.560 
P7: 
So that's just something. 

0:6:49.570 --> 0:6:55.50 
P7: 
So if that all opened up like at the same time, that would just save, that would just save time. 

0:6:55.760 --> 0:6:56.140 
Moderator:  
OK. 

0:6:57.140 --> 0:6:58.530 
Moderator:  
So that actually rolls right into. 

0:6:58.540 --> 0:7:2.130 
Moderator:  
My next question, which was can you walk me through? 

0:7:2.140 --> 0:7:13.90 
Moderator:  
So once you worked out the kinks in the beginning a little bit, your final process for sending, receiving and reviewing these questionnaires, so similar to how you send you, you came in every morning and would pull up PHL. 

0:7:13.100 --> 0:7:15.200 
Moderator:  
What was your final process from start to finish? 

0:7:17.60 --> 0:7:20.680 
P7: 
Umm, so I would open up the BHL. 

0:7:21.320 --> 0:7:23.40 
P7: 
Then you have to go under. 

0:7:25.110 --> 0:7:26.200 
P7: 
Uh, let me do this. 

0:7:26.210 --> 0:7:26.990 
P7: 
Why we're talking? 

0:7:27.250 --> 0:7:30.510 
P7: 
I'm you would have to open up. 

0:7:39.500 --> 0:7:39.720 
Moderator:  
Mm-hmm. 

0:7:30.960 --> 0:7:39.790 
P7: 
Umm, I think it says charts in progress or something and then you click there and then those are all the responses from the veterans, right? 

0:7:39.800 --> 0:7:42.490 
P7: 
That we sent out and they all responded back. 

0:7:42.610 --> 0:7:51.310 
P7: 
So then those you have to say upload all into CPRS, then you have to come over to CPRS and you have to go over to your view alerts. 

0:7:51.600 --> 0:7:55.110 
P7: 
Your view alerts are then going to have all unsigned. 

0:7:55.160 --> 0:7:56.750 
P7: 
They're all going to say unsigned. 

0:7:56.860 --> 0:7:59.210 
P7: 
So all of those you have to click them open. 

0:7:59.260 --> 0:8:0.180 
P7: 
Look at them. 

0:8:0.260 --> 0:8:7.140 
P7: 
If there's nothing for you to do, you right, but consign if there's something for you to do, then you have to put in the consult to everything. 

0:8:7.250 --> 0:8:9.750 
P7: 
And again, this is all before your clinic starts. 

0:8:10.180 --> 0:8:10.380 
Moderator:  
Mm-hmm. 

0:8:11.460 --> 0:8:11.740 
P7: 
So. 

0:8:12.830 --> 0:8:18.250 
Moderator:  
Did pushing that for everybody for the day in the beginning have any impact on check in? 

0:8:20.580 --> 0:8:20.950 
P7: 
I'm sorry. 

0:8:20.960 --> 0:8:22.110 
P7: 
One more time with the question. 

0:8:27.810 --> 0:8:28.240 
P7: 
Mm-hmm. 

0:8:22.310 --> 0:8:30.100 
Moderator:  
So pushing everything from BHL to CPRS at the beginning of the day for everybody that that generated a note did that. 

0:8:30.610 --> 0:8:34.490 
Moderator:  
Having that note there impact the check-in flow in any way. 

0:8:34.930 --> 0:8:38.790 
P7: 
Most definitely, yes, much better. 

0:8:41.140 --> 0:8:41.690 
Moderator:  
Great. 

0:8:41.920 --> 0:8:57.180 
Moderator:  
Umm, we did hear from other sites who were using the other tool that the fact that a note actually appeared automatically check the veteran in for their appointment even though it was multiple hours in advance that that happened at your location. 

0:8:59.710 --> 0:9:2.30 
P7: 
That it actually checked the patient in. 

0:9:2.570 --> 0:9:3.790 
Moderator:  
Yeah, into the appointment. 

0:9:4.530 --> 0:9:5.400 
P7: 
I did not see that. 

0:9:6.380 --> 0:9:6.580 
Moderator:  
OK. 

0:9:8.530 --> 0:9:16.530 
Moderator:  
And umm, can you tell me a little bit about the process of prior to the day of the appointment? 

0:9:22.910 --> 0:9:23.610 
P7: 
Yes. 

0:9:16.540 --> 0:9:23.750 
Moderator:  
You're so like when the actual act of sending them out, so before them aren't now. 

0:9:24.360 --> 0:9:30.660 
P7: 
So usually what we're doing is we're sending them out like like a week's worth. 

0:9:32.520 --> 0:9:40.940 
P7: 
So if I was to send out so say like for this week, I would send out on the 19th through the 25th. 

0:9:41.830 --> 0:9:42.30 
Moderator:  
OK. 

0:9:43.40 --> 0:9:52.890 
P7: 
So, but the one of the problems that we were noticing is we have a provider here who's covering one of the providers that left and she's a temporary, right? 

0:9:53.210 --> 0:9:53.450 
Moderator:  
Umm. 

0:9:52.900 --> 0:9:56.970 
P7: 
So she is a nurse practitioner, so she gets a lot of add ONS. 

0:9:57.240 --> 0:10:0.590 
P7: 
So a lot of her patients, because they're Adams. 

0:10:0.670 --> 0:10:15.740 
P7: 
I don't know if it's because they were added short term, like maybe yesterday or the day before that they did not get captured in this BHL so those any addons which can be quite a few on her schedule. 

0:10:15.820 --> 0:10:20.540 
P7: 
You know you'll look and there will be, you know, 10-12 reminders on her patients. 

0:10:20.750 --> 0:10:29.560 
P7: 
And so I brought that to Redactted attention and asked her, and she said that she thinks it's because they're being scheduled, you know, just so quickly. 

0:10:37.840 --> 0:10:38.80 
Moderator:  
OK. 

0:10:30.290 --> 0:10:39.720 
P7: 
So then for her, I tried to not do like a whole stretch of a week and just do like two and three days at a time, and that seemed to, and that seemed to be better. 

0:10:41.160 --> 0:10:41.500 
Moderator:  
OK. 

0:10:42.920 --> 0:10:53.610 
Moderator:  
On a scale from one to five, with one being very easy and five being very difficult, how easy or difficult was it to use the BHL tool? 

0:10:53.620 --> 0:10:56.350 
Moderator:  
So not the whole process, just like the tool itself. 

0:10:58.720 --> 0:10:59.480 
P7: 
Umm one. 

0:11:1.960 --> 0:11:7.210 
Moderator:  
And has the quality of the time you spend with patients improved or worsened due to this process? 

0:11:8.520 --> 0:11:9.770 
P7: 
Oh, I would say improved. 

0:11:11.700 --> 0:11:11.830 
Moderator:  
Why? 

0:11:13.570 --> 0:11:40.970 
P7: 
Because when you have, when you have a busy clinic and every veteran has like several things that you have to go over plus give shots plus you know there's like a lot going on in that check in time and then not to mention if you get a veteran in here that has like super high blood pressure or super low blood pressure, their blood sugars are off, they're not feeling well. 

0:11:41.160 --> 0:11:42.970 
P7: 
They're having acute chest pain. 

0:11:45.50 --> 0:11:45.290 
Moderator:  
Umm. 

0:11:49.820 --> 0:11:49.960 
Moderator:  
Yeah. 

0:11:43.20 --> 0:12:4.950 
P7: 
All of that right, I mean your visit can be you can be in here for a while now when you take and you go from 12 reminders down to four, I mean that quality of time that you are spending with that veteran not having to go over all of those questions that really don't need attention if they're all negative, right? 

0:12:4.810 --> 0:12:5.60 
Moderator:  
Umm. 

0:12:5.610 --> 0:12:8.460 
P7: 
Umm are it's better right? 

0:12:8.470 --> 0:12:21.510 
P7: 
Because then you don't feel so rushed and you can answer questions and you can, you know, not feel like the doctor is, you know, not going to be happy because they're running 15 minutes behind or whatever. 

0:12:23.680 --> 0:12:28.320 
Moderator:  
Do you feel this process maintains an appropriate level of safety and clinical integrity? 

0:12:30.810 --> 0:12:31.460 
P7: 
Umm yes. 

0:12:33.180 --> 0:12:35.30 
Moderator:  
And can you elaborate on that as well? 

0:12:36.150 --> 0:12:36.540 
P7: 
Yeah. 

0:12:36.550 --> 0:12:42.240 
P7: 
So I think so right now, it sounds like they're giving us permission to send out certain ones. 

0:12:42.310 --> 0:12:47.800 
P7: 
Like I don't have that list right here in front of me, but you probably have it, so I'm not. 

0:12:48.10 --> 0:12:53.340 
P7: 
I'm not sure if they get the suicide one or the depression. 

0:12:53.350 --> 0:12:57.400 
P7: 
Those are probably ones that we still do here, but like a lot of. 

0:12:56.930 --> 0:12:58.620 
Moderator:  
Currently they don't. 

0:12:58.630 --> 0:13:1.880 
Moderator:  
That's part there were six part of the pilot and that was not. 

0:13:1.930 --> 0:13:2.810 
Moderator:  
Those weren't part of it. 

0:13:3.180 --> 0:13:3.850 
P7: 
Yeah. 

0:13:3.860 --> 0:13:8.410 
P7: 
So and then there was another one, too, that sexual orientation. 

0:13:8.730 --> 0:13:9.40 
Moderator:  
Umm. 

0:13:8.880 --> 0:13:19.200 
P7: 
So that was a little bit of a issue when we first started because it kept populating and I I kept saying to Jess, I don't think we're supposed to be doing that one right. 

0:13:20.890 --> 0:13:24.120 
P7: 
So I'm sorry, back to the question I got cut. 

0:13:26.560 --> 0:13:28.10 
Moderator:  
I was like, I definitely want to hear that too. 

0:13:28.20 --> 0:13:31.880 
Moderator:  
Your thoughts on and expansion and the impact and like is there any? 

0:13:33.850 --> 0:13:38.410 
Moderator:  
Any clinical reminders that you wouldn't want to have delivered to veterans digitally? 

0:13:41.40 --> 0:13:41.780 
P7: 
On behalf. 

0:13:45.720 --> 0:13:49.950 
P7: 
I feel like, you know, I always try to put myself like in their shoes. 

0:13:49.960 --> 0:13:50.850 
P7: 
Like, how would I? 

0:13:53.470 --> 0:13:53.820 
Moderator:  
Umm. 

0:13:50.900 --> 0:13:53.830 
P7: 
How would I feel if this came to my phone right? 

0:13:53.840 --> 0:14:4.610 
P7: 
And how and you know, sometimes I feel like people are maybe more willing to answer things honestly if they are just by themselves, right. 

0:14:4.660 --> 0:14:8.710 
P7: 
And on their phone and they can just click, you know, whatever their comfort level is. 

0:14:9.190 --> 0:14:9.480 
Moderator:  
Umm. 

0:14:9.120 --> 0:14:29.520 
P7: 
And but I think like the suicide, you know, just like when we used to scrub the schedules, you know, we were really cautious about asking about suicide or depression because the problem is if a veteran says they're, they're thinking about suicide and say, I get that BHL result. 

0:14:29.530 --> 0:14:29.990 
P7: 
Right. 

0:14:30.480 --> 0:14:30.640 
Moderator:  
Yeah. 

0:14:30.110 --> 0:14:32.540 
P7: 
And I see that it's positive, right? 

0:14:32.770 --> 0:14:35.650 
P7: 
Well, what if that patient is a notional? 

0:14:36.910 --> 0:14:37.240 
Moderator:  
Umm. 

0:14:38.70 --> 0:14:44.960 
P7: 
Then it creates like a whole nother and then I'd be like, Oh my gosh, like I need to give this to someone, right? 

0:14:44.970 --> 0:14:54.940 
P7: 
Someone needs to follow up on this so then you know it's getting the RN involved letting the doctor know you know, and then they try to reach out to the patient and you know what I mean? 

0:14:54.950 --> 0:14:59.30 
P7: 
So like something like that I would think is probably better served than the clinic. 

0:14:59.880 --> 0:15:0.100 
Moderator:  
OK. 

0:15:1.240 --> 0:15:8.910 
P7: 
But like a depression, one I think is probably OK, but the suicide one I just feel like I don't know. 

0:15:9.0 --> 0:15:11.300 
P7: 
You know, we do get veterans that do tell us. 

0:15:12.440 --> 0:15:12.670 
Moderator:  
Umm. 

0:15:11.310 --> 0:15:27.740 
P7: 
Yes, you know, so in it it is kind of nice when we do come across them that we do have resources and you know a lot of times they can be seen that same day to try to get help and you know it's just hard when if you were to do that on your phone. 

0:15:32.120 --> 0:15:32.340 
Moderator:  
Yeah. 

0:15:27.750 --> 0:15:34.120 
P7: 
And like I said, if you have a no show appointment or something, it just you know, it's just a lot more concern there. 

0:15:34.130 --> 0:15:35.90 
P7: 
So so yeah. 

0:15:37.0 --> 0:15:45.270 
Moderator:  
Uh, any other screeners besides mental health that you think shouldn't be involved or will flip that too? 

0:15:45.420 --> 0:15:51.550 
Moderator:  
Anyones that were not part of the pilot that you definitely think should be digitized? 

0:15:52.130 --> 0:15:52.700 
P7: 
Yes. 

0:15:52.710 --> 0:15:54.750 
P7: 
So tell me the six that were again. 

0:15:56.320 --> 0:16:6.150 
Moderator:  
Umm tobacco sexual orientation, embedded fragments, TBI, toxic exposure. 

0:16:8.520 --> 0:16:10.460 
Moderator:  
Ohh, missing the last one. 

0:16:12.820 --> 0:16:14.250 
Moderator:  
Nina, do you remember the last one? 

0:16:17.240 --> 0:16:18.680 
Anusavice, Nina R. 
Did we give food security? 

0:16:19.400 --> 0:16:21.590 
Moderator:  
No, that one food security and housing security. 

0:16:26.780 --> 0:16:35.10 
P7: 
So like questions like UM, so ideally we're all over the spectrum with immunizations, right? 

0:16:35.170 --> 0:16:35.420 
Moderator:  
Mm-hmm. 

0:16:35.340 --> 0:16:37.390 
P7: 
So those kind of questions. 

0:16:39.780 --> 0:16:45.30 
P7: 
I I mean me personally, I think those would be fine if if those got sent out. 

0:16:45.40 --> 0:16:49.80 
P7: 
Like if you're due for a shingle shot, you're due for an ammonia, tetanus. 

0:16:49.90 --> 0:16:50.390 
P7: 
You know all of that. 

0:16:50.500 --> 0:17:1.990 
P7: 
You know if if that gets sent out to the veteran and they are an anti vaxxer and they're not going to get vaccinated for them to be like, no, no no, you know and click all of those buttons. 

0:17:2.130 --> 0:17:10.720 
P7: 
So when I get them in the room, I don't even like that is something that just would save a lot of time, right? 

0:17:9.590 --> 0:17:10.960 
Moderator:  
Yes. Yeah. 

0:17:10.810 --> 0:17:22.320 
P7: 
Because a lot of times people just aren't going to change their mind just by you talking to them because obviously they're doctor is, you know, working on trying to, you know, encourage them to do so. 

0:17:24.20 --> 0:17:27.320 
P7: 
So I feel like that would be that would be helpful. 

0:17:28.560 --> 0:17:28.800 
Moderator:  
Yeah. 

0:17:30.980 --> 0:17:31.370 
Moderator:  
Right. 

0:17:32.390 --> 0:17:41.680 
Moderator:  
Was your data entry simplified with just the scope of the six for this pilot, and if so, or if not, how am I? 

0:17:43.730 --> 0:17:45.990 
P7: 
Was it simplified by doing it? 

0:17:45.660 --> 0:17:46.790 
Moderator:  
Yeah. Yes. 

0:17:48.660 --> 0:17:48.860 
P7: 
Yes. 

0:17:51.350 --> 0:17:54.830 
P7: 
And you know, just like I just said, it was simplified because. 

0:17:55.610 --> 0:18:3.350 
P7: 
Umm, because those things are all questions that we need to go over with the veteran when they come in. 

0:18:5.370 --> 0:18:11.400 
Moderator:  
And then I mean notice a decrease or increase in the notifications you receive about clinical reminders? 

0:18:14.300 --> 0:18:15.570 
P7: 
Oh, a decrease. I mean, if they're, if they're taking care of it on their end when I get them in the room, I might have like 4.To go over with them. 

0:18:27.380 --> 0:18:31.210 
Moderator:  
Would you agree or disagree with the following statement? 

0:18:31.300 --> 0:18:34.130 
Moderator:  
Overall clinical reminder burden has been reduced. 

0:18:36.850 --> 0:18:37.830 
P7: 
It's, I agree. 

0:18:40.360 --> 0:18:48.10 
Moderator:  
And how much time would you estimate has been saved, if any, by collecting these clinical reminder responses prior to the appointment? 

0:18:50.320 --> 0:18:52.780 
P7: 
Seemed when though I mean. 

0:18:52.410 --> 0:18:56.710 
Moderator:  
Yeah, it could be per appointment per week you can pick. 

0:19:5.850 --> 0:19:6.80 
Moderator:  
Umm. 

0:18:58.500 --> 0:19:12.800 
P7: 
Well, so it's saving, it's saving on the intake with the patient, but it's more time for me behind the scenes to take care of that in order to make it easier for the intake. 

0:19:13.960 --> 0:19:15.90 
Moderator:  
It is, yeah. 

0:19:12.810 --> 0:19:15.600 
P7: 
Does that make sense? So. 

0:19:15.100 --> 0:19:21.460 
Moderator:  
So would you say holistically is a an increase slight increase or slight decrease or you know more? 

0:19:22.640 --> 0:19:22.960 
P7: 
So. 

0:19:25.470 --> 0:19:27.450 
P7: 
Overall, UM. 

0:19:47.460 --> 0:19:47.740 
Moderator:  
Yeah. 

0:19:29.600 --> 0:19:48.270 
P7: 
I would say it's probably still a decrease even with, you know having to do the paper or the, you know, the prep for the BHL what now that it's up and running, I feel like everybody who has a pack team, I mean it's pretty easy to do, right? 

0:19:48.340 --> 0:20:8.940 
P7: 
So I everybody who has a pack team really should just get in the routine of doing it for their team and it, you know, it's like I was telling Jess, it's it's encouraging because you want to do the extra work because it's like it makes your life and the veteran's life easier. 

0:20:9.0 --> 0:20:11.150 
P7: 
And check in when the clinic is very busy. 

0:20:11.980 --> 0:20:12.160 
Moderator:  
Yeah. 

0:20:13.260 --> 0:20:14.170 
P7: 
Does that make sense? 

0:20:14.490 --> 0:20:15.240 
Moderator:  
It does. 

0:20:14.180 --> 0:20:15.650 
P7: 
I mean it's. Yeah. 

0:20:15.850 --> 0:20:22.300 
Moderator:  
If you had to put a number on like when the patients in the room, how is this impacted the time? 

0:20:22.450 --> 0:20:27.340 
Moderator:  
So has it saved anything when they're in the actual the the intake of the appointment? 

0:20:28.110 --> 0:20:29.70 
Moderator:  
What would that number be? 

0:20:32.450 --> 0:20:33.610 
P7: 
Oh, you mean minute wise? 

0:20:34.250 --> 0:20:34.450 
Moderator:  
Yeah. 

0:20:38.380 --> 0:20:42.100 
P7: 
Oh, I would say I would say it's improved by probably. 

0:20:44.550 --> 0:20:46.510 
P7: 
5-7 minutes maybe. 

0:20:47.390 --> 0:20:47.530 
Moderator:  
And. 

0:20:50.120 --> 0:20:53.840 
Moderator:  
Now, how could be HL be improved or changed? 

0:20:55.500 --> 0:21:1.500 
P7: 
Umm, so when you open it up in the when you open up CPRS BHL automatically opens up. 

0:21:3.70 --> 0:21:9.140 
P7: 
Now it would be great if you didn't have to do upload all results, right? 

0:21:9.150 --> 0:21:13.160 
P7: 
If it just blew right into CPRS, I could come in in the morning. 

0:21:13.170 --> 0:21:15.620 
P7: 
I could take a look, I could see all the view alerts. 

0:21:15.630 --> 0:21:21.430 
P7: 
I could just click mopin right, take a quick look at them, sign them off, and then I could get started with my day. 

0:21:22.460 --> 0:21:22.680 
Moderator:  
OK. 

0:21:23.170 --> 0:21:29.760 
P7: 
I mean it's, you know, it's another thing like to think about when you come in in the morning and I have to be honest, sometimes I come in. 

0:21:29.770 --> 0:21:32.260 
P7: 
I'm like, oh, I forgot to be HL, right? 

0:21:32.270 --> 0:21:33.720 
P7: 
It's like ohh I forgot to do that. 

0:21:34.480 --> 0:21:34.700 
Moderator:  
Yeah. 

0:21:35.190 --> 0:21:35.960 
P7: 
So. 

0:21:36.950 --> 0:21:42.340 
P7: 
So yeah, if it can become more of a A ah. 

0:21:44.460 --> 0:21:48.310 
P7: 
A part of what we already do, you know what I mean? 

0:21:48.320 --> 0:22:3.200 
P7: 
As far as like opening things up, like you know, opening up this, we have to open up CPRS, we have to umm we have to open up our VSE for the schedule you know and umm. 

0:22:5.920 --> 0:22:6.330 
P7: 
Yeah. 

0:22:6.380 --> 0:22:12.330 
P7: 
And then on top of that then it would be then it would be my healthy vet BHL you know. 

0:22:12.340 --> 0:22:15.580 
P7: 
So again, it's just one more thing that you have to think of to do. 

0:22:16.930 --> 0:22:17.130 
Moderator:  
OK. 

0:22:19.520 --> 0:22:32.650 
Moderator:  
Is there actually any other notes that you had or any topics that you were hoping to cover about the pilot in your experience that you would that you wanted to share with us that I haven't already asked about today? 

0:22:35.320 --> 0:22:36.490 
P7: 
I don't think so. 

0:22:36.500 --> 0:22:38.710 
P7: 
I mean, I think I think it's great. 

0:22:38.720 --> 0:22:49.850 
P7: 
I mean, I was super excited to be a part of this pilot just because me working in the clinic, it's like it directly affects like what I do so. 

0:23:4.380 --> 0:23:4.620 
Moderator:  
Yeah. 

0:22:51.560 --> 0:23:11.570 
P7: 
I was very optimistic that this was gonna be a positive change for us and, you know, even the nurse manager has said that, I mean, our response is a lot of veterans are responding, you know, and I think the biggest thing we're talking about now is it would be nice if they opened it up besides the six. 

0:23:11.680 --> 0:23:12.180 
P7: 
Right. 

0:23:12.460 --> 0:23:13.280 
Moderator:  
OK. Umm. 

0:23:12.230 --> 0:23:18.610 
P7: 
I mean, let's let's really open our opportunities to have them answer as much as they can, right. 

0:23:18.620 --> 0:23:24.900 
P7: 
And if they can't, and if they can't and aren't able to answer, then we just take care of it when they're in here. 

0:23:25.860 --> 0:23:27.320 
Moderator:  
OK, great. 

0:23:28.270 --> 0:23:30.780 
Moderator:  
Thank you so much for taking time to talk to us today. 

0:23:30.790 --> 0:23:31.600 
Moderator:  
So there is. 

0:23:31.870 --> 0:23:35.560 
Moderator:  
So this is a crossover, so you're going to be experiencing the other tool. 

0:23:35.650 --> 0:23:45.300 
Moderator:  
So you screening is coming to your site soon, so we are hoping to let you know to do a similar, you know half hour interview at the end of the crossover. 

0:23:45.530 --> 0:23:45.830 
P7: 
OK. 

0:23:45.310 --> 0:23:47.750 
Moderator:  
That way we'll be able to compare contrast. 

0:23:48.520 --> 0:23:48.780 
P7: 
OK. 

0:23:48.420 --> 0:23:48.830 
Moderator:  
Umm. 

0:23:49.40 --> 0:23:52.450 
Moderator:  
Which tool and how did it impact you and which one did you like better or worse? 

0:23:52.460 --> 0:23:53.140 
Moderator:  
And how did it go? 

0:23:53.900 --> 0:23:56.860 
P7: 
OK, perfect. And. 

0:23:54.410 --> 0:23:59.990 
Moderator:  
So so that, you know, I know that I'll probably be in a couple months while reaching back out to schedule another one of these. 

0:24:0.660 --> 0:24:1.90 
P7: 
OK. 

0:24:1.100 --> 0:24:1.870 
P7: 
And when do we? 

0:24:1.880 --> 0:24:3.220 
P7: 
When does the other one roll out? 

0:24:4.310 --> 0:24:9.480 
Moderator:  
Umm, I know there's been conversations with with people at Minneapolis. 

0:24:9.490 --> 0:24:11.930 
Moderator:  
We're trying to work on the next week or two. 

0:24:14.860 --> 0:24:17.370 
Moderator:  
To do the flip, but I don't know. 

0:24:17.380 --> 0:24:22.20 
Moderator:  
I haven't been in the actual the meetings to discuss the timeline so soon. 

0:24:21.680 --> 0:24:22.20 
P7: 
OK. 

0:24:24.100 --> 0:24:26.120 
Moderator:  
But other people in Minneapolis should know about that. 

0:24:27.820 --> 0:24:29.620 
P7: 
OK, alright. 

0:24:30.960 --> 0:24:32.670 
Moderator:  
So thank you so much. 

0:24:32.800 --> 0:24:38.730 
Moderator:  
And like I said, all of this will help us evaluate the tools and make sure that we can have this process work for both staff and veterans. 

0:24:39.390 --> 0:24:39.730 
P7: 
Perfect. 

0:24:39.60 --> 0:24:40.180 
Moderator:  
So enjoy the rest of your day. 

0:24:40.690 --> 0:24:41.550 
P7: 
Thank you so much. 

0:24:41.560 --> 0:24:42.360 
P7: 
You too. 

0:24:43.370 --> 0:24:43.620 
P7: 
Bye bye. 

0:24:43.900 --> 0:24:44.0 
Moderator:  
Bye.
