I'm just gonna let you know that we just use the recordings to confirm we captured your opinions accurately. 

0:0:7.0 --> 0:0:15.960 
Moderator: 
None of the comments will be attributed to directly, so if we do in any reports that I have, it'll just be like staff member one or you know something like that ohm. 

0:0:19.690 --> 0:0:20.60 
Moderator: 
That was. 

0:0:20.70 --> 0:0:23.20 
Moderator: 
The whole feel. So really. 

0:0:23.100 --> 0:0:24.350 
Moderator: 
Yeah, let's go into. 

0:0:26.330 --> 0:0:29.200 
Moderator: 
Tell me a little bit more about how you were involved in this pilot. 

0:0:30.340 --> 0:0:30.800 
P5: 
Umm. 

0:0:30.840 --> 0:0:33.350 
P5: 
I was asked to be involved in the pilot. 

0:0:33.880 --> 0:0:40.250 
P5: 
We worked in compensation and pension, so we are a part of primary care, but we don't really. 

0:0:40.970 --> 0:0:43.980 
P5: 
I have much, uh. 

0:0:46.570 --> 0:0:49.320 
P5: 
Connection with the with the Medical Center. 

0:0:59.590 --> 0:0:59.780 
Moderator: 
Umm. 

0:0:49.710 --> 0:1:8.940 
P5: 
So you know there is a slew of reminders, clinical reminders, and but our main focus is the toxic exposure screening follow UPS on that can only be done by a licensed provider, not an RN and NP, PA, doctor, licensed clinical social worker or something like that. 

0:1:9.630 --> 0:1:22.110 
P5: 
And we were asked because and I started working here September 25th and there was a backlog of like 3000 TES follow up reminders. 

0:1:22.120 --> 0:1:25.660 
P5: 
That's the second phase where the provider needs to sign off on those. 

0:1:26.140 --> 0:1:26.360 
Moderator: 
Yeah. 

0:1:25.930 --> 0:1:29.820 
P5: 
And no, I mean it just no one had been doing them. 

0:1:31.220 --> 0:1:31.700 
P5: 
Uh. 

0:1:31.740 --> 0:1:39.550 
P5: 
And so I got that list down to zero or down at 0% being greater than 30 days is actually like a day to day operation. 

0:1:39.740 --> 0:1:42.270 
P5: 
So I think they just kind of wanted to know how someone. 

0:1:44.190 --> 0:1:48.790 
P5: 
Could do that, or had the time or what they did to do that and be involved in that way? 

0:1:50.40 --> 0:1:51.910 
P5: 
Umm, so then that's how I got involved. 

0:1:54.320 --> 0:2:3.490 
P5: 
Uh, my experience, you know, it's kind of, you know, I'm or so focused on the toxic exposure, I think it's been productive. 

0:2:3.500 --> 0:2:5.960 
P5: 
I think umm, it's helpful. 

0:2:5.970 --> 0:2:7.830 
P5: 
It's a better way of. 

0:2:10.490 --> 0:2:10.850 
P5: 
Uh. 

0:2:13.390 --> 0:2:15.40 
P5: 
Maintenance health maintenance. 

0:2:15.50 --> 0:2:16.370 
P5: 
It's the reminders. 

0:2:16.380 --> 0:2:18.240 
P5: 
Are I? 

0:2:18.440 --> 0:2:24.320 
P5: 
Worked primary care, so I can imagine that they would be helpful for me having if I was doing primary care, they're just there. 

0:2:24.330 --> 0:2:29.490 
P5: 
It's a click, just sometimes there's so many different datas systems. 

0:2:31.20 --> 0:2:31.200 
Moderator: 
Yeah. 

0:2:29.780 --> 0:2:36.280 
P5: 
So it's like 1 reports to this one source of data and you gotta pull it up from that system. 

0:2:36.290 --> 0:2:41.840 
P5: 
And then the other one and umm, so I think that's probably the hardest part. 

0:2:41.850 --> 0:2:47.50 
P5: 
And I think that John and the and and the team have been able to point those things out. 

0:2:47.170 --> 0:2:50.950 
P5: 
I think by by doing the pilot I think, yeah. 

0:2:52.830 --> 0:2:53.480 
Moderator: 
So then where? 

0:2:55.860 --> 0:3:7.300 
Moderator: 
Can you tell me a little bit more about how you use BHL in your workflow now versus do you still get most of everything that you do just in the outer CPRS or? 

0:3:9.150 --> 0:3:9.730 
Moderator: 
Which are that? 

0:3:8.880 --> 0:3:10.670 
P5: 
I don't even have access to BHL. 

0:3:10.680 --> 0:3:11.850 
P5: 
John tried to get me it. 

0:3:11.860 --> 0:3:13.730 
P5: 
I don't know what's happening with that. 

0:3:13.840 --> 0:3:15.210 
P5: 
Umm, I use everything. 

0:3:18.650 --> 0:3:18.890 
Moderator: 
OK. 

0:3:15.260 --> 0:3:22.650 
P5: 
All my data is pulled off power BI, umm, and there's tons of different ways to pull reports from there. 

0:3:23.400 --> 0:3:27.150 
P5: 
Filtering your you know the the data you get. 

0:3:27.420 --> 0:3:29.630 
P5: 
I I don't think I need anything else. 

 

0:3:31.140 --> 0:3:32.910 
P5: 
Any other system, but I'll get it. 

0:3:32.920 --> 0:3:39.520 
P5: 
When when I get access to it, I'll check it out and see if it becomes more beneficial, but I have everything I need. 

0:3:39.530 --> 0:3:40.690 
P5: 
Power BI is awesome. 

0:3:40.940 --> 0:3:41.340 
P5: 
I don't. 

0:3:42.720 --> 0:3:43.240 
P5: 
I can't. 

0:3:43.290 --> 0:3:46.660 
P5: 
I I don't know what BHL would do for me if I had it, so I've never used it. 

0:3:48.490 --> 0:3:56.90 
Moderator: 
Really, you just worry about the list of the positive screens where you have to take the next step so that that's the part you're interested in. 

0:3:56.740 --> 0:3:57.770 
P5: 
Yeah, I'm only. 

0:3:57.780 --> 0:4:9.780 
P5: 
I'm only interested in the positive screens and the ones that don't get closed because then that creates uh, you know, veterans aren't getting the connections that they need and. 

0:4:11.880 --> 0:4:13.990 
P5: 
You know, it's it doesn't look good on the VA. 

0:4:14.0 --> 0:4:19.590 
P5: 
I mean, uh, I think they get, you know, the primary care doctors, so to speak. 

0:4:20.500 --> 0:4:22.370 
P5: 
They are aware rewarded. 

0:4:24.520 --> 0:4:31.430 
P5: 
With having closed those and when they don't get that, that's when big VA notices, you know, so. 

0:4:34.390 --> 0:4:38.380 
Moderator: 
Did you go through any training related to BHL at all? 

0:4:38.470 --> 0:4:42.190 
Moderator: 
Even though I know you didn't actually get access, you have have any involve. 

0:4:41.140 --> 0:4:44.670 
P5: 
I just learned what it was probably 2 weeks ago and I didn't even. 

0:4:44.760 --> 0:4:46.250 
P5: 
I still don't even really know what it is. 

0:4:48.240 --> 0:4:51.240 
Moderator: 
OK, so like. 

0:4:51.830 --> 0:4:53.500 
P5: 
Nobody in my department knows what it is. 

0:4:54.800 --> 0:4:55.750 
Moderator: 
Can't be HL. 

0:4:57.370 --> 0:4:58.270 
Moderator: 
Well, we are. 

0:4:58.340 --> 0:5:8.510 
Moderator: 
So that is the reminders that you're getting in your power BI report were looking at a different way to actually gather that feedback. 

0:5:8.520 --> 0:5:12.950 
Moderator: 
So most of the time it's the veteran comes in and sits with the provider, right? 

0:5:13.20 --> 0:5:15.40 
Moderator: 
And is actually physically in the appointment. 

0:5:15.50 --> 0:5:17.10 
Moderator: 
It's face to face in the answer the question. 

0:5:17.300 --> 0:5:17.540 
P5: 
Mm-hmm. 

0:5:25.520 --> 0:5:25.840 
P5: 
Umm. 

0:5:17.380 --> 0:5:28.410 
Moderator: 
That's one of the ways we can gather the toxic exposure answers with your BHL will send a text or an email to the vendor and maybe like a week beforehand, right? 

0:5:28.500 --> 0:5:30.310 
Moderator: 
And they answer those questions at home. 

0:5:30.420 --> 0:5:36.820 
Moderator: 
And then that day that that data comes into the BHL and they can actually move that over to CPS and make a note. 

0:5:36.830 --> 0:5:37.960 
Moderator: 
So it's it's testing. 

0:5:39.30 --> 0:5:52.20 
Moderator: 
No, it's that electronic workflow and the impact of veteran staff and also does that help the LPN's or not help the you know the clinical staff with going through all the clinical reminders. 

0:5:55.370 --> 0:5:55.570 
P5: 
Yeah. 

0:5:52.230 --> 0:5:56.280 
Moderator: 
So I know we've heard that clinical reminders take up a lot of time during an appointment. 

0:5:56.590 --> 0:5:57.880 
Moderator: 
We can move it beforehand. 

0:5:57.890 --> 0:5:58.720 
Moderator: 
It's not helpful. 

0:5:58.810 --> 0:6:5.210 
Moderator: 
So BHL is this is one of the systems we're testing to see how that does impact that process. 

0:6:4.410 --> 0:6:7.0 
P5: 
Yeah, yeah, I that's right that that makes sense. 

0:6:7.10 --> 0:6:8.170 
P5: 
Yeah, that's nice. 

0:6:8.180 --> 0:6:15.830 
P5: 
I mean, as a veteran, I mean I I mean or even a patient myself, I would prefer not to be sitting in a lobby or you know. 

0:6:18.190 --> 0:6:24.470 
P5: 
I mean or even a patient myself, I would prefer not to be sitting in a lobby or you know. 

 

0:6:25.450 --> 0:6:26.160 
P5: 
I like those. 

0:6:26.160 --> 0:6:26.320 
Moderator: 
Yeah. 

0:6:27.0 --> 0:6:27.530 
P5: 
Those are good. 

0:6:30.230 --> 0:6:38.560 
Moderator: 
So have you heard any received or heard any feedback about this toxic exposure screening from providers or other VA staff? 

0:6:39.820 --> 0:6:40.950 
P5: 
Yeah, I mean, I got a. 

0:6:43.70 --> 0:6:43.460 
P5: 
Mr. 

0:6:43.470 --> 0:6:47.910 
P5: 
Kelly, he's the director of Minneapolis VA, scheduled a call with me. 

0:6:48.590 --> 0:6:58.700 
P5: 
I've got Many thanks for from the chief of staff and and from him and multiple leadership and primary care. 

0:6:59.490 --> 0:7:8.140 
P5: 
If I've heard tons of feedback, I mean umm, it was something that this hot list was uh, causing a lot of. 

0:7:11.500 --> 0:7:12.130 
P5: 
Scrutiny. 

0:7:12.140 --> 0:7:18.970 
P5: 
I can't think of a better word right now, but it was a lot of issues for a long time, so it's something that they don't even have to monitor anymore. 

0:7:18.980 --> 0:7:21.330 
P5: 
So I've gotten a lot of feedback, positive feedback. 

0:7:24.410 --> 0:7:24.940 
Moderator: 
Great. 

0:7:24.990 --> 0:7:27.700 
Moderator: 
What are some of the steps you take so the ones that aren't closed? 

0:7:28.700 --> 0:7:30.690 
Moderator: 
How can you tell me about your process there? 

0:7:31.310 --> 0:7:32.410 
P5: 
Yeah. 

0:7:32.810 --> 0:7:35.620 
P5: 
So the ones that aren't closed, I just pulled that from Power BI. 

0:7:35.630 --> 0:7:42.590 
P5: 
I have my excel sheet of people that had questions, people that didn't know of concerns. 

0:7:42.600 --> 0:7:44.600 
P5: 
Those are the two that you have to call back. 

0:7:44.670 --> 0:7:47.80 
P5: 
So I just go in and make an addendum. 

0:7:48.250 --> 0:7:49.810 
P5: 
Umm answer. 

0:7:49.820 --> 0:7:50.930 
P5: 
Yes, they have questions. 

0:7:50.940 --> 0:7:53.670 
P5: 
Registry questions, exposure related questions. 

0:7:53.900 --> 0:8:0.970 
P5: 
And then if they're in red, meaning they have questions or don't know, I put them on my excel sheet and then I make attempts to call them. 

0:8:1.440 --> 0:8:9.860 
P5: 
I also have a generated letter I could show you our email it to you if you're interested in what it is that has all the hyperlinks. 

0:8:10.680 --> 0:8:26.30 
P5: 
Umm, all the presumptive conditions of these toxic exposures that were passed through the packed act links to the VBA links to the VA, the VSO and I if they have my healthy vet, I send that to them through my healthy vet. 

0:8:26.200 --> 0:8:26.900 
P5: 
And then I also. 

0:8:27.80 --> 0:8:27.290 
Moderator: 
Umm. 

0:8:28.320 --> 0:8:28.830 
P5: 
Umm. 

0:8:29.920 --> 0:8:35.40 
P5: 
If they don't, I just put it in USPS and then I I do that first thing in the morning. 

0:8:38.530 --> 0:8:38.760 
Moderator: 
Alright. 

0:8:35.50 --> 0:8:40.860 
P5: 
when I get in at 7 so I I pull that list and then around you know around 11. 

0:8:41.590 --> 0:8:42.720 
P5: 
Don't wanna call too early. 

0:8:42.730 --> 0:8:50.920 
P5: 
Sometimes 10 to by the end of the day, I make those phone calls and the majority 97% of the time people are like, yeah, I got your letter. 

0:8:51.310 --> 0:8:52.100 
P5: 
It's like I wait. 

0:8:52.110 --> 0:9:1.260 
P5: 
I I make that call a one to two day leg because I want them to get the letter and have a chance to review it because I was doing it too early and they're like I didn't get a chance to read it yet, you know. 

0:9:2.330 --> 0:9:2.780 
Moderator: 
The yeah. 

0:9:3.480 --> 0:9:3.820 
P5: 
Uh. 

0:9:3.830 --> 0:9:7.910 
P5: 
And so then they're like, ohh, half the time that I got that letter, it was great. 

0:9:7.920 --> 0:9:8.930 
P5: 
I was able to got. 

0:9:8.940 --> 0:9:10.280 
P5: 
I got your nurses number. 

0:9:10.380 --> 0:9:11.590 
P5: 
I called her to schedule. 

0:9:11.880 --> 0:9:14.650 
P5: 
I found out that I wasn't actually in the registry. 

0:9:14.660 --> 0:9:16.480 
P5: 
I did that, but that was before January. 

0:9:17.280 --> 0:9:19.370 
P5: 
Umm of January 2024. 

0:9:19.380 --> 0:9:20.380 
P5: 
They don't have to do that anymore. 

0:9:23.190 --> 0:9:27.0 
P5: 
The letter and my healthy vet I have really helped. 

0:9:28.90 --> 0:9:30.20 
P5: 
I'm not have to have those. 

0:9:30.320 --> 0:9:32.570 
P5: 
Those people, you can't get a hold of cause I call. 

0:9:32.760 --> 0:9:52.440 
P5: 
I leave a voicemail and I say I did send you a very detailed a lot of information, all the information you need is there, including my number, my email, my healthy vet, my nurses and maybe one out of 100 calls back because that letter has so much information, calls back with a further question, they call back to schedule based off that letter. 

0:9:52.450 --> 0:9:54.10 
P5: 
So I don't have to do the constant phone tag. 

0:9:54.670 --> 0:9:55.10 
P5: 
Umm. 

0:9:55.360 --> 0:9:55.560 
Moderator: 
Yeah. 

0:9:56.290 --> 0:10:11.680 
P5: 
And that's just kind of one of the reasons why these things weren't getting done because of the attempts to do phone calls, which nobody really answers their phone anymore, you know, I mean, it seemed unrealistic to, UM, to keep doing those. 

0:10:11.690 --> 0:10:13.110 
P5: 
I mean, you're not going to get anywhere. 

0:10:13.120 --> 0:10:16.900 
P5: 
You have to find it in 2024 way to do things you know. 

0:10:18.320 --> 0:10:18.480 
Moderator: 
Yeah. 

0:10:19.190 --> 0:10:24.370 
P5: 
And people don't really bother on the phone, so I feel like the letter I'm sometimes too. 

0:10:24.380 --> 0:10:28.120 
P5: 
I'll do both the letter and a phone call if I see they're like over 70. 

0:10:29.100 --> 0:10:37.70 
P5: 
You know, just because they don't, they're gonna be confused if they get something like that in the mail, they'll they just won't understand what it is. 

0:10:37.280 --> 0:10:40.10 
P5: 
You know what is when you say the word toxic 

0:10:40.20 --> 0:10:44.840 
P5: 
People get scared, you know, like, so if I see they're older. 

0:10:45.580 --> 0:10:46.700 
P5: 
I always tried to do both. 

0:10:48.140 --> 0:10:56.60 
Moderator: 
OK, so that all of those people that you just talked about were ones that did the first Screener and were positive. 

0:10:56.620 --> 0:10:56.840 
P5: 
Yep. 

0:10:57.90 --> 0:10:57.820 
Moderator: 
What about the? 

0:10:58.0 --> 0:10:59.640 
Moderator: 
What does it look like on your end? 

0:10:59.690 --> 0:11:8.150 
Moderator: 
If a Screener was sent out but they didn't reply to like it was supposed to, fill out the toxic exposure, but they didn't. 

0:11:9.680 --> 0:11:10.990 
Moderator: 
What does that look like to you? 

0:11:11.0 --> 0:11:12.430 
Moderator: 
If if you see that at all. 

0:11:13.680 --> 0:11:14.780 
P5: 
The Screener. 

0:11:15.120 --> 0:11:16.530 
P5: 
Can you can you word that again? 

0:11:18.170 --> 0:11:21.900 
Moderator: 
So within like the VHL, so the. The system that actually sends out the screeners digitally? 
Maybe that veteran was supposed to fill out the toxic exposure Screener, but they just didn't actually do it. Or I guess what does that look like to you? They would still have the appointment later where the doctor would ask them do you? Is that scenario? Do you see that in any of the screens that you look at? 

0:11:49.820 --> 0:11:51.290 
P5: 
No, I don't think. 

0:11:51.300 --> 0:11:53.370 
P5: 
I don't think I have a way to get that information. 

0:11:55.830 --> 0:11:55.990

OK. 

0:11:56.790 --> 0:11:56.980 
P5: 
So. 

0:11:56.950 --> 0:12:0.490 
Moderator: 
I just want to double check that was actually my assumption, but I wanted to double. 

0:11:59.580 --> 0:12:7.690 
P5: 
Yeah, yeah, there's quite a few things you can pull there, but I don't think on Power BI can I have the capability to do that? 

0:12:8.40 --> 0:12:12.200 
P5: 
I do have some issues like what I'd like to see with the the. 

0:12:12.210 --> 0:12:13.540 
P5: 
Is it be HDL or VHDL? 

0:12:15.420 --> 0:12:15.890 
Moderator: 
B. 

0:12:15.940 --> 0:12:16.300 
Moderator: 
As in boy. 

0:12:16.330 --> 0:12:16.690 
P5: 
OK. 

0:12:16.740 --> 0:12:17.820 
P5: 
Yeah. PHL. 

0:12:17.830 --> 0:12:21.850 
P5: 
So I thought, but sometimes it sounds like you're saying V, but it would make sense for it to be V too. 

0:12:24.190 --> 0:12:25.300 
P5: 
Sometimes I worry that. 

0:12:27.800 --> 0:12:32.510 
P5: 
I would say good 60 70% of the contact I make on the phone. 

0:12:32.900 --> 0:12:35.50 
P5: 
The ohh no I didn't have any questions. 

0:12:35.640 --> 0:12:36.210 
P5: 
I didn't. 

0:12:40.800 --> 0:12:41.10 
Moderator: 
I. 

0:12:36.280 --> 0:12:41.30 
P5: 
I thought I didn't know what they were asking me, so that's one of them. 

0:12:41.100 --> 0:12:49.980 
P5: 
And so the majority of my note on my Excel sheet said actually had no questions, knows what the registry is already you know, I can see sometimes I can. 

0:12:51.350 --> 0:12:52.220 
P5: 
See that coming? 

0:12:52.230 --> 0:12:57.780 
P5: 
Because their service connected disability for vasomotor rhinitis, which is a presumptive. 

0:12:57.790 --> 0:13:7.620 
P5: 
So they've already done all this and they just probably the LPN didn't know how to ask them or didn't really understand what she was asking because she doesn't have the experience with it. 

0:13:8.590 --> 0:13:9.660 
P5: 
So that's one of the things too. 

0:13:9.240 --> 0:13:11.280 
Moderator: 
That's great, yeah. 

0:13:9.670 --> 0:13:27.870 
P5: 
And then, yeah, so I think that there's some sort of barrier with the education that LPN's have bait on toxic exposure like we had a good example depleted uranium fragments, umm, embedded fragments. I think what happened was the LPN said. Do you have any embedded fragments and the guy? I mean, he's just like a 38 year old guy. He had a hardware in his wrist from a a wrist injury, and so he's like, yeah, you know, and so she responded. Yes, and that created a whole. Yes, there this can go two ways. The staff over here who just kind of does whatever they want. Sometimes I don't. 
	Instead of confirming that before you order a $4000 test and send it to Baltimore overnight mail, maybe confirm, the guy really needs it before you do that. So that goes, it goes both ways. But so that initiated this. He comes in, he's like, I don't even really know why I'm here. Then the LPN spent takes at least 30 minutes to fill out the paperwork. He had to come in and he's here because not for depleted uranium embedment fragments for. But it hardware and his wrist. So that's kind of those are the kind of the frustrations with the reminders. I'm as a TS navigator. I need to figure out how to do training and how to get time with LPN's and the primary care doctors because they're not coding the hazards properly and it's not linked to a snowbed code, and that's a whole nother backlog I have, but I'm not. 

0:14:46.760 --> 0:14:49.790 
P5: 
I can only do so much, so I'm not gonna worry about that too much. 

0:14:58.450 --> 0:14:58.660 
Moderator: 
Umm. 

0:14:50.40 --> 0:14:59.370 
P5: 
And then the other one is, is that maybe BHL would have if it gets closed out, I don't know, they had questions. 

0:14:59.420 --> 0:15:0.430 
P5: 
So I asked. 

0:15:0.480 --> 0:15:13.850 
P5: 
I did a leaf request about a month ago now to have in my template or in the the reminder template to have a a a button to click on a tsk TSK navigator console. 

0:15:14.180 --> 0:15:23.680 
P5: 
So I'm I'm only getting the ones who haven't been closed because I can pull those from Power BI, but I'm not getting the ones that have questions that are closed. 

0:15:32.660 --> 0:15:32.800 
P5: 
Yeah. 

0:15:24.900 --> 0:15:36.410 
Moderator: 
Because there is a there in BHL, there is a question where it has like, do you have any follow up questions related to a whole series of topics, so that those are not getting. 'm not getting those. If that provider closed his fault, his TES follow up. I'd have to go in so I have I I give these numbers to John. I'd have to go into. Yesterday was 100. The 19th was 112 appointments on the 19th and look at every single closed encounter or TS follow up that was closed to see if that better and had questions. 
So I don't have a good way of finding out who's getting missed that I could be sending this letter to sending the my health evet information so they could contact me when they're ready. So we don't do phone tag thing. I wish there was a way, which that's how my solution for that which Kirsten Mains highly recommends. Almost every VA has it. I don't know what the holdup is. 
	A TES navigator console so when that when that primary care is with their patient and they do have questions, they can still close their follow up reminder and they can click TS Navigator console and then it shows up for me and CPRS. I put them in my excel, I call them, send them the letter. 
I don't have a way of doing that right now other than going through Power BI to closed one. 

0:16:52.260 --> 0:16:53.530 
P5: 
All 118 a day. 

0:16:55.70 --> 0:16:56.950 
Moderator: 
Alright, let me. 

0:17:0.950 --> 0:17:1.130 
Moderator: 
That. 

0:16:55.750 --> 0:17:1.200 
P5: 
So that would be maybe BHL offers that you know, I don't know, I should this come out now. 

0:17:1.210 --> 0:17:1.800 
P5: 
It's getting annoying. 

0:17:3.350 --> 0:17:5.340 
Moderator: 
Yeah, I was like, that's good feedback. 

0:17:5.430 --> 0:17:10.280 
Moderator: 
I have a question about so the ones that you do actually see what types of questions they have. 

0:17:10.350 --> 0:17:12.940 
Moderator: 
You commented that you call and sometimes they say no. 

0:17:14.40 --> 0:17:14.160 
P5: 
Yes. 

0:17:12.950 --> 0:17:14.220 
Moderator: 
I don't have any questions. 

0:17:14.530 --> 0:17:19.60 
Moderator: 
Is there particular topics that cause more veteran confusion? 

0:17:19.210 --> 0:17:27.600 
Moderator: 
So is it because I know there's registry, there's enrollment, there's different types that do you see any trends to the veteran feedback? 

0:17:33.300 --> 0:17:49.260 
P5: 
No, most of the the, the, the common trend is ohh I just thought she was asking me if I had any exposures and then when I said yes she must have clicked that I had the the trend is they were just saying yes I've had exposures and what they are but no no trend like. 

0:17:51.220 --> 0:17:53.60 
P5: 
To a specific exposure. 

0:17:55.130 --> 0:17:55.980 
Moderator: 
OK. 

0:17:56.90 --> 0:17:57.120 
Moderator: 
OK or. 

0:17:55.950 --> 0:17:57.220 
P5: 
So it was probably in my head. 

0:17:57.230 --> 0:17:59.580 
P5: 
It was rushed through and he the the veterans like. 

0:18:3.710 --> 0:18:4.0 
Moderator: 
OK. 

0:18:5.320 --> 0:18:8.30 
Moderator: 
And then the I check book. 

0:17:59.590 --> 0:18:8.750 
P5: 
Oh yeah, I've been exposed to the burn pits and yeah, I mean, I just had my first via appointment and the only reason why, yeah. 

0:18:8.760 --> 0:18:15.430 
P5: 
The only reason why I knew what she was talking about is cause I do this, but the way she asked me, I probably would have been like, well, what do you mean? 

0:18:15.840 --> 0:18:22.530 
P5: 
You know, if I wasn't, if I didn't know what she was talking about, but sometimes people just don't ask questions there, you know. 

0:18:24.700 --> 0:18:27.730 
Moderator: 
And yeah, that makes sense. 

0:18:31.610 --> 0:18:32.530 
Moderator: 
I'll go through my list. 

0:18:32.570 --> 0:18:38.220 
Moderator: 
Most of the questions that I had were if you actually utilize BHL, so let me see if there's anything else that applies. 

0:18:39.340 --> 0:18:40.890 
P5: 
If you can get me access, I'll use it. 

0:18:43.960 --> 0:18:46.180 
Moderator: 
I was like I I see John tomorrow. 

0:18:47.100 --> 0:18:49.940 
Moderator: 
I can talk to him, but he would be the one but. 

0:18:49.160 --> 0:18:53.40 
P5: 
Yeah, I he knows that I want it, but I haven't heard any anything back for a while. 

0:18:54.800 --> 0:18:59.990 
Moderator: 
So this is a crossover study, so your site is actually causing the VHL. 

0:19:0.0 --> 0:19:0.390 
Moderator: 
We're gonna. 

0:19:0.400 --> 0:19:3.270 
Moderator: 
There's another tool called E screening and flip it. 

0:19:3.660 --> 0:19:3.840 
P5: 
Yeah. 

0:19:3.340 --> 0:19:6.840 
Moderator: 
So we're gonna enter that phase two soon. 

0:19:7.620 --> 0:19:7.780 
P5: 
Yeah. 

0:19:8.530 --> 0:19:12.600 
Moderator: 
So it would be we can maybe reach out and working through that process. 

0:19:12.610 --> 0:19:15.630 
Moderator: 
I'm gonna talk to John and maybe we could try again once the screening when it's coming. 

0:19:16.180 --> 0:19:19.990 
P5: 
I think I I think I remember an email him saying something about that as well. 

0:19:20.0 --> 0:19:21.520 
P5: 
So I think he might be doing that already. 

0:19:28.470 --> 0:19:28.910 
P5: 
OK, cool. 

0:19:22.840 --> 0:19:29.50 
Moderator: 
Yeah, we're in the he's in the process of getting you and Butler set up perfect too. 

0:19:31.130 --> 0:19:31.650 
Moderator: 
Great. 

0:19:32.10 --> 0:19:37.220 
Moderator: 
I was like, I don't think any of the other questions that I have specifically apply to your experience. 

0:19:37.230 --> 0:19:41.200 
Moderator: 
Is there anything else that you wanted to share with me that you haven't? 

0:19:47.210 --> 0:19:48.990 
P5: 
Kind of looking at it and note looking at. 

0:19:51.590 --> 0:19:52.800 
P5: 
No, just say my best. 

0:19:52.810 --> 0:19:57.0 
P5: 
I guess my biggest concern is I would like a way to generate a report. 

0:19:57.50 --> 0:19:57.280 
P5: 
Or. 

0:19:59.430 --> 0:20:5.600 
P5: 
On the ones that did have questions, they're they're not coming to me or like that leaf request to get that console added. 

0:20:5.610 --> 0:20:19.670 
P5: 
So they could I I can get that contact cause I'm I imagine I don't have any numbers to prove this, but I imagine it's a pretty high, you know over you know 50 at least 50% of those people have had questions aren't hearing back from a TS navigator. 

0:20:21.620 --> 0:20:21.800 
Moderator: 
OK. 

0:20:21.280 --> 0:20:23.50 
P5: 
Because the the provider closed them. 

0:20:23.540 --> 0:20:25.200 
P5: 
So I I don't, I don't see those. 

0:20:27.890 --> 0:20:28.290 
Moderator: 
Great. 

0:20:28.650 --> 0:20:28.830 
P5: 
Yeah. 

0:20:28.960 --> 0:20:32.580 
Moderator: 
So no other no other changes that you have made to the work. 

0:20:32.590 --> 0:20:34.560 
Moderator: 
So that's a really good suggestion on that one. 

0:20:35.390 --> 0:20:37.710 
P5: 
No, no, I don't think so. 

0:20:37.800 --> 0:20:38.150 
P5: 
It's a. 

0:20:38.160 --> 0:20:51.940 
P5: 
It's a really once you once I got this, I gave myself like a month or two to like, take it all in and like, learn CPRS and listen get into the meetings and listen to what people are doing. 

0:20:51.950 --> 0:20:56.130 
P5: 
And it was just a matter of staying focused and getting it done. 

0:20:56.180 --> 0:20:58.210 
P5: 
And then now it's just the day to day operation. 

0:20:58.220 --> 0:21:2.270 
P5: 
It takes me about 2 hours tops and and do it in between patients eating. 

0:21:2.280 --> 0:21:3.200 
P5: 
It's it's not hard. 

0:21:7.210 --> 0:21:9.310 
Moderator: 
OK, great. 

0:21:9.360 --> 0:21:10.470 
Moderator: 
Well, thank you so much. 

0:21:10.480 --> 0:21:11.880 
Moderator: 
I really appreciate you taking the time. 

0:21:11.890 --> 0:21:13.0 
Moderator: 
I'll give you a bunch of time back. 

0:21:13.550 --> 0:21:14.70 
P5: 
No worries. 

0:21:16.330 --> 0:21:16.800 
P5: 
Yeah. 

0:21:15.230 --> 0:21:17.240 
Moderator: 
That it's a. 

0:21:16.810 --> 0:21:19.60 
P5: 
My they didn't book me a 10:00 o'clock. 

0:21:19.70 --> 0:21:26.210 
P5: 
So I had time here to do this, so just going through my list, making calls, so no worries. 

0:21:27.740 --> 0:21:33.110 
Moderator: 
Thanks, this will help us evaluate the tools and make sure this process works for all the different staff roles and veterans. 

0:21:33.500 --> 0:21:34.510

So enjoy the rest of your day. 

0:21:35.50 --> 0:21:36.310

You too, be safe. 

0:21:36.410 --> 0:21:36.680

Yeah, bye. 

0:21:37.800 --> 0:21:38.250
