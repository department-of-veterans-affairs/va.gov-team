Role: LPN 

Tool: eScreening 

 

0:0:0.0 --> 0:0:0.240 
P4: 
OK. 

0:0:-6.-450 --> 0:0:1.450 
  
Maybe directly since this is like a research study, and if we quote you, we'll just say like staff #2 and something like that. 

0:0:2.850 --> 0:0:10.50 
Moderator: 
OK, so my first group of questions are about how you learn to use the tool. 

0:0:10.460 --> 0:0:17.120 
Moderator: 
So first on a scale from one to five, with one being very easy and five being very difficult. 

0:0:17.180 --> 0:0:21.530 
Moderator: 
How easy or difficult was it to learn how to use escreening? 

0:0:23.120 --> 0:0:23.780 
P4: 
Maybe a 2? 

0:0:25.140 --> 0:0:26.330 
Moderator: 
OK, why? 

0:0:28.650 --> 0:0:42.510 
MODERATOR: 
It I mean it's kind of self-explanatory when you go into there, I mean as long as you know what the verbiage is like creating a battery and you know as long as you know what that stuff is it it's pretty easy to navigate. 

0:0:45.70 --> 0:0:47.300 
Moderator: 
How long did it take you to learn to use the tool? 

0:0:49.230 --> 0:0:52.300 
P4: 
Umm do you think it of maybe two times? 

0:0:52.370 --> 0:0:54.380 
P4: 
I was pretty much caught on to it. 

0:0:56.770 --> 0:0:57.0 
P4: 
I. 

0:0:56.160 --> 0:1:2.360 
Moderator: 
They can you describe your onboarding process though, and your trainings or things you read or anything. 

0:1:3.690 --> 0:1:12.930 
P4: 
I think the trainings actually listening to people say stuff and doing it yourself was two totally different things. 

0:1:14.200 --> 0:1:20.990 
P4: 
It was just easier, I feel, to navigate on my own and get a feel for it and learn how to use it. 

0:1:21.0 --> 0:1:22.880 
P4: 
Then it was to actually go through the training. 

0:1:23.630 --> 0:1:23.870 
Moderator: 
OK. 

0:1:25.170 --> 0:1:28.680 
Moderator: 
How much time did the more you know the training take though? 

0:1:31.550 --> 0:1:36.750 
Moderator: 
So not the part that you did yourself exploring, but the like the last part, whatever. 

0:1:34.30 --> 0:1:38.200 
P4: 
Ah, I don't remember. 

0:1:38.320 --> 0:1:40.780 
P4: 
Maybe it was like 1/2 hour? 

0:1:40.910 --> 0:1:42.160 
P4: 
I'm I can't remember though. 

0:1:45.120 --> 0:1:52.280 
Moderator: 
And if you could change one thing about the on boarding or the training process that that you received, what would it be? 

0:1:55.470 --> 0:1:55.710 
P4: 
Umm. 

0:1:58.270 --> 0:2:0.160 
P4: 
Everything just really hard to follow. 

0:2:0.170 --> 0:2:4.640 
P4: 
I think it was hard to follow when we were doing it through teams. 

0:2:6.240 --> 0:2:10.190 
P4: 
There is a lot of confusion, I think. 

0:2:10.380 --> 0:2:12.910 
P4: 
I think what needed to happen more was. 

0:2:15.480 --> 0:2:20.360 
P4: 
They were doing it and just showing us, and I think we needed to actually have. 

0:2:22.300 --> 0:2:28.470 
P4: 
The process already done where we can go in with them and kind of do it along with them to get a better understanding. 

0:2:30.780 --> 0:2:31.100 
P4: 
Yeah. 

0:2:29.370 --> 0:2:31.200 
Moderator: 
And follow along as I go through it. 

0:2:31.210 --> 0:2:31.320 
Moderator: 
OK. 

0:2:32.940 --> 0:2:36.760 
Moderator: 
Is there anything else that was confusing or just because you couldn't follow along? 

0:2:37.460 --> 0:2:40.640 
P4: 
Yeah, it was just hard to follow along when you didn't really know what. 

0:2:42.540 --> 0:2:44.230 
P4: 
But it's going to be happening. 

0:2:44.300 --> 0:2:45.460 
P4: 
It was just confusing. 

0:2:48.10 --> 0:2:54.320 
Moderator: 
And I know you are an LPN there, so all this I I'm pretty sure the next question is a no. 

0:2:54.330 --> 0:2:55.440 
Moderator: 
But I want to ask you anyway. 

0:3:0.210 --> 0:3:0.470 
P4: 
Now. 

0:2:55.690 --> 0:3:1.310 
Moderator: 
Were you involved in helping configure the tool at your site in any way? OK. 

0:3:3.840 --> 0:3:7.710 
Moderator: 
Then my next group will be about actually utilizing these screening. 

0:3:8.230 --> 0:3:8.430 
P4: 
OK. 

0:3:8.100 --> 0:3:9.710 
Moderator: 
So can you walk me through? 

0:3:9.720 --> 0:3:13.20 
Moderator: 
So maybe after you know the first couple times. 

0:3:14.0 --> 0:3:21.320 
Moderator: 
Umm, when you actually got a process going, can you walk me through your final process for sending, receiving and reviewing these questionnaires? 

0:3:23.770 --> 0:3:34.720 
P4: 
So that had to become another habit and just kind of trying to remind myself to go in and do it until you got into your habit. 

0:3:34.730 --> 0:3:50.150 
P4: 
I like would on Fridays I would create a battery umm to go out on Saturday through I I would pick people for the entire week for their appointments. 

0:3:51.900 --> 0:3:52.130 
Moderator: 
Yeah. 

0:3:52.120 --> 0:4:6.230 
P4: 
And then I think then you have to remember to go in on Monday for the appointments and try to complete the task so that it shows in Vista, us in CPRS. 

0:4:8.50 --> 0:4:14.940 
P4: 
That became like a little that was a little difficult and a little hard to remember sometimes because sometimes I come in here. 

0:4:18.940 --> 0:4:19.80 
Moderator: 
Yeah. 

0:4:14.950 --> 0:4:20.330 
P4: 
My day starts at 8:00 o'clock and I'm getting charts ready and doing all that and I start at 7:30. 

0:4:20.430 --> 0:4:27.220 
P4: 
It takes me 1/2 hour to just do that process and then I'll go in a room and start doing the the questions I'm like. 

0:4:27.230 --> 0:4:33.220 
P4: 
Oh jeez, I forgot to go into E screening and see if anybody you know did that today. 

0:4:33.570 --> 0:4:34.670 
P4: 
So it was a little. 

0:4:36.880 --> 0:4:40.40 
P4: 
It was just another thing added on to the daily task, you know. 

0:4:41.10 --> 0:4:41.660 
Moderator: 
And you did. 

0:4:41.670 --> 0:4:44. 

410 
Moderator: 
Every morning you went in and did a little check. 

0:4:43.990 --> 0:4:50.240 
P4: 
I try to remember to go in every morning and recheck and actually it got to the point where I wasn't remembering to go in every morning. 

0:4:50.630 --> 0:4:53.930 
P4: 
So I was going in and completing everybody for the week. So it would save to my CPRS which created other issues for me. So it these E screenings create encounters. So I was getting emails from other departments saying you have encounters that need completed and they're really not encounters. They shouldn't be creating encounters because they're going along with the appointment. It was just something it just created different issues and then they sit there in my notifications the entire week waiting for them to come in. And then if they didn't show for the appointment or they rescheduled, I had to go in and delete it or it would sit there forever showing in encounter. 

0:5:46.390 --> 0:5:52.440 
Moderator: 
OK, so if you are, if you automatically push it through, then that comes problems to revert it if needed. 

0:5:51.830 --> 0:5:55.100 
P4: 
And I also could not even go in and look at it. 

0:5:55.190 --> 0:5:58.20 
P4: 
It would uncheck them for their appointment So it would check them out.So say I went and looked at somebody like today's Wednesday and tomorrow's their appointment. If I went in and I clicked on that and just looked at it, it would check them out for their appointment. Then I would have to have somebody uncheck the appointment. 

0:6:24.140 --> 0:6:25.10 
P4: 
You know what I mean? 

0:6:25.390 --> 0:6:25.620 
Moderator: 
Yeah. 

0:6:25.60 --> 0:6:27.740 
P4: 
It caused a lot of different problems. 

0:6:29.150 --> 0:6:29.750 
P4: 
So. 

0:6:29.460 --> 0:6:32.170 
Moderator: 
Did it did it just? 

0:6:32.520 --> 0:6:34.630 
Moderator: 
It wasn't the act of you. 

0:6:34.680 --> 0:6:35.790 
Moderator: 
I just want to clarify something. 

0:6:41.980 --> 0:6:42.300 
P4: 
Right. 

0:6:35.800 --> 0:6:43.390 
Moderator: 
So would you send it the reminder and responses into CPRS and that didn't actually check them out? 

0:6:43.400 --> 0:6:46.600 
Moderator: 
It's when you clicked on the encounter to review it, the check them out. 

0:6:46.220 --> 0:6:48.210 
P4: 
Now just me clicking on the note. 

0:6:48.30 --> 0:6:49.280 
Moderator: 
Just click and send it OK. 

0:6:49.490 --> 0:6:52.920 
P4: 
Yeah, . 

0:6:53.50 --> 0:6:57.250 
P4: 
Check them out of their appointment like they were like they checked in. 

0:6:57.480 --> 0:6:58.270 
P4: 
You know what I mean? 

0:6:57.910 --> 0:6:58.710 
Moderator: 
Yeah, yeah. 

0:6:59.260 --> 0:7:4.360 
P4: 
So then I'd have to send an email to somebody else to uncheck the appointment because I didn't mean for that to happen. 

0:7:5.730 --> 0:7:7.520 
P4: 
So I couldn't even review them. 

0:7:7.910 --> 0:7:13.720 
P4: 
The only way I could review them was doing it in the escreening 
Health assessment in the dashboard. 

0:7:19.510 --> 0:7:25.600 
Moderator: 
Though you would prefer to review them in where it sounds like. 

0:7:25.370 --> 0:7:25.840 
P4: 
It would. 

0:7:25.990 --> 0:7:27.970 
P4: 
It would be better that if. 

0:7:29.990 --> 0:7:32.240 
P4: 
It wouldn't create an encounter at all. 

0:7:32.750 --> 0:7:33.660 
P4: 
You know what I mean? 

0:7:40.320 --> 0:7:40.630 
Moderator: 
Hmm. 

0:7:34.230 --> 0:7:45.470 
P4: 
Because I know they did this process to do the questions and you know, have them sit in the notifications.But then it's causing problems with our people that monitor our encounters and say we're not doing our encounters. And I'm like, well, they weren't here yet. 

0:7:55.30 --> 0:7:59.580 
P4: 
And I got a lot at sit there so people get antsy about that. 

0:7:59.590 --> 0:8:0.310 
P4: 
Well, why? 

0:8:2.170 --> 0:8:2.400 
Moderator: 
Yeah. 

0:8:0.500 --> 0:8:4.460 
P4: 
Like you know, it's just a whole, right? 

0:8:2.410 --> 0:8:4.940 
Moderator: 
They're metrics are off, yeah. 

0:8:4.660 --> 0:8:14.360 
P4: 
So it'd be nice if it would actually just get created as a notification, but not cause an encounter. 

0:8:15.720 --> 0:8:15.920 
Moderator: 
No. 

0:8:18.370 --> 0:8:25.10 
Moderator: 
So on a scale from one to five, would again, one being very easy and five being very difficult. 

0:8:25.130 --> 0:8:28.60 
Moderator: 
How easy or difficult is it to use these screening? 

0:8:30.530 --> 0:8:33.440 
P4: 
It's not difficult to use the events the screening. 

0:8:40.530 --> 0:8:40.700 
Moderator: 
No. 

0:8:33.450 --> 0:8:43.930 
P4: 
It just crops caused a lot more issues than should have been caused, I think because it was causing me more. 

0:8:43.940 --> 0:8:45.230 
P4: 
It's causing me more work. 

0:8:45.240 --> 0:8:49.220 
P4: 
It's not actually making things easier on me. 

0:8:49.230 --> 0:8:50.670 
P4: 
It made things more difficult. 

0:8:52.870 --> 0:9:1.620 
P4: 
Because it would cause an encounter, and not only that, when they come in for the appointment, I have to do my health prevention questions, sign that. 

0:9:1.630 --> 0:9:5.960 
P4: 
Then I have to go sign the other one and I can't sign either one of them. 

0:9:5.970 --> 0:9:10.180 
P4: 
Now when an escreenings in there sitting waiting because it's showing an encounter. 

0:9:10.350 --> 0:9:16.110 
P4: 
So I have to wait for the provider to do their note sign off, do the encounter, and then I can sign my notes. 

0:9:18.110 --> 0:9:18.800 
Moderator: 
Ohh OK. 

0:9:22.300 --> 0:9:26.780 
Moderator: 
But what's all of the other screeners that you're the other way you were able just to sign immediately? 

0:9:28.830 --> 0:9:29.460 
P4: 
Yeah. 

0:9:29.510 --> 0:9:40.900 
P4: 
So when they come in for an appointment and I'm just doing a health screening, I go through my questions, I sign my note, then the provider goes in and does their process with the E screening. 

0:9:40.950 --> 0:9:42.440 
P4: 
I'm not able to sign the note. 

0:9:43.30 --> 0:9:57.570 
P4: 
I have to wait until cause it's creating an encounter, have to wait for the provider to do their notes so multiple encounters aren't done so they all become one cohesive encounter. 

0:10:2.500 --> 0:10:3.280 
P4: 
It wants me. 

0:9:59.530 --> 0:10:4.700 
Moderator: 
OK, so if you would sign it beforehand then the IT would look like the patient had two appointments. 

0:10:5.240 --> 0:10:5.610 
P4: 
Right. 

0:10:5.660 --> 0:10:12.500 
P4: 
It wants me to do umm and encounter for diagnosis and procedure. 

0:10:13.570 --> 0:10:13.830 
Moderator: 
Alright. 

0:10:14.670 --> 0:10:23.970 
P4: 
Which we know should not be done because they're having an appointment with the provider, and they'll be the ones doing an account or for the appointment. 

0:10:25.280 --> 0:10:33.200 
Moderator: 
And though has the quality of the time spent with the patient improved or worsened due to this process? 

0:10:34.670 --> 0:10:45.730 
P4: 
I mean, I don't think it's really changed anything too much because the most the most questions are doing are maybe three and I can do three questions within a minute or two. 

0:10:46.940 --> 0:10:48.190 
Moderator: 
What do you think? 

0:10:48.200 --> 0:10:52.360 
Moderator: 
If there were more clinical reminders, part of this that that would have an impact. 

0:10:53.830 --> 0:10:55.100 
P4: 
Oh yeah, if there was a lot more. 

0:10:57.440 --> 0:11:9.120 
P4: 
Reminders it would, it would make a huge impact and as long as it didn't create an encounter and didn't check people out and people touch that note beforehand, you know what I mean? 

0:11:9.750 --> 0:11:9.930 
Moderator: 
Yeah. 

0:11:10.500 --> 0:11:22.480 
P4: 
So like if I wanted to go in in the morning and say they were coming in in the morning and I wanted to review the health prevention questions, I can't even review them in CPRS because then it's going to check them out. 

0:11:26.290 --> 0:11:31.930 
P4: 
So if those things weren't an issue, it would be a wonderful tool. 

0:11:34.850 --> 0:11:35.10 
Moderator: 
And. 

0:11:32.0 --> 0:11:49.600 
P4: 
But I mean, I think the process maybe could be different like when like when I create a battery if I forgot I created battery, it didn't show me in there either that I already recreated one because they don't pop up. 

0:11:54.320 --> 0:11:54.500 
Moderator: 
OK. 

0:11:50.730 --> 0:11:59.370 
P4: 
It doesn't show you that you created a battery that's pending, so if so, I had to start marking my calendar to remind myself that I already did it. 

0:12:1.300 --> 0:12:1.610 
Moderator: 
Umm. 

0:12:0.150 --> 0:12:3.500 
P4: 
You know, because you have a lot going on in a day and you're like, oh my gosh, I did that. 

0:12:3.510 --> 0:12:3.880 
P4: 
Do that? 

0:12:3.690 --> 0:12:4.140 
Moderator: 
Of course. 

0:12:3.890 --> 0:12:4.770 
P4: 
Or did I not do that? 

0:12:5.690 --> 0:12:14.730 
P4: 
So there needs to be something saving that a create a battery was created in pending for whatever week or whatever days. 

0:12:15.540 --> 0:12:21.220 
P4: 
Umm, there also needs to be like maybe some kind of. 

0:12:24.670 --> 0:12:25.190 
P4: 
I don't know. 

0:12:32.50 --> 0:12:32.250 
Moderator: 
OK. 

0:12:26.400 --> 0:12:35.510 
P4: 
Reminder, maybe when somebody completes a questionnaire that you, you could go in and be like, oh, OK, I got to complete that. 

0:12:35.520 --> 0:12:35.970 
P4: 
You know what? 

0:12:35.980 --> 0:12:37.720 
P4: 
Or finalize it or whatever. 

0:12:39.590 --> 0:12:57.350 
P4: 
And also there are now like I have 4 pages of umm dashboards, and it'd be nice if they like fell off after the patient's appointment date and time that they didn't just still sit in there. 

0:12:59.770 --> 0:12:59.950 
P4: 
Yes. 

0:12:58.360 --> 0:13:1.120 
Moderator: 
Within the E screening system that they OK. 

0:13:3.110 --> 0:13:4.60 
Moderator: 
So you want to see? 

0:13:4.70 --> 0:13:8.550 
Moderator: 
It sounds like the ones that are more actionable that you need to do something are still the ones that you want to see. 

0:13:8.330 --> 0:13:9.880 
P4: 
Right, right. 

0:13:11.180 --> 0:13:11.320 
Moderator: 
Yeah. 

0:13:12.610 --> 0:13:19.860 
Moderator: 
Is there not back to what we talked about, and you said it would be helpful if more clinical reminders were in the product. 

0:13:19.980 --> 0:13:23.760 
Moderator: 
Is there any particular ones that you think would really improve? 

0:13:22.90 --> 0:13:31.630 
P4: 
There's so many clinics, there's so many clinical reminders that patients could do on their own that we have that would benefit. 

0:13:34.450 --> 0:13:34.700 
Moderator: 
OK. 

0:13:34.510 --> 0:13:40.480 
P4: 
Umm, I'm just trying to get a feel for I know what's on there like that. 

0:13:42.490 --> 0:13:43.360 
P4: 
The homeless? 

0:13:43.570 --> 0:13:44.0 
P4: 
Umm. 

0:13:44.10 --> 0:13:48.230 
P4: 
Wine, like if they have shelter and stuff like that. Umm. 

0:13:50.310 --> 0:13:51.260 
P4: 
Have another meeting. 

0:13:52.130 --> 0:13:52.680 
P4: 
Let me see. 

0:13:53.530 --> 0:13:59.580 
P4: 
So how about their sexual orientation is on there? 

0:13:59.590 --> 0:13:59.820 
P4: 
I know. 

0:14:3.600 --> 0:14:3.890 
Moderator: 
Umm. 

0:14:3.670 --> 0:14:6.490 
P4: 
The homeless food insecurity screen is on there. 

0:14:7.790 --> 0:14:8.990 
P4: 
What was the third one? 

0:14:11.250 --> 0:14:12.520 
Moderator: 
Toxic exposure. 

0:14:14.0 --> 0:14:14.570 
P4: 
Argyra. 

0:14:14.580 --> 0:14:18.230 
P4: 
OK, the toxic exposure, I think those are the only three that I've been seeing. 

0:14:18.720 --> 0:14:20.180 
P4: 
We have ones that are like. 

0:14:22.10 --> 0:14:22.390 
P4: 
Umm. 

0:14:25.120 --> 0:14:27.490 
P4: 
Trying to find a patient where I can like go in there and look. 

0:14:29.850 --> 0:14:30.670 
P4: 
They try this one. 

0:14:40.440 --> 0:14:48.170 
P4: 
That RHS screen, the intimate partner violence screen and tobacco screen alcohol screen. 

0:14:48.180 --> 0:14:51.650 
P4: 
I know people can lie about that, but they're going to lie to us, to our face anyways. 

0:14:51.890 --> 0:14:53.350 
P4: 
So you know. 

0:14:56.700 --> 0:15:3.90 
P4: 
The education evaluation the fall like, have you fallen in the past 12 months? 

0:15:3.100 --> 0:15:5.950 
P4: 
You know the health care hardship question. 

0:15:9.860 --> 0:15:23.390 
P4: 
The move, like if that if they well, I guess the move we have to kind of do a height and weight so that one that primary care skin evaluation like have I had any pressure ulcers in the past. 

0:15:26.260 --> 0:15:30.360 
P4: 
I mean, there are things that we just asked when they come in them directly because it's. 

0:15:33.990 --> 0:15:37.130 
P4: 
You know their word on what they're telling us anyways. 

0:15:38.550 --> 0:15:39.200 
Moderator: 
Yeah. 

0:15:39.570 --> 0:15:40.240 
Moderator: 
Is there any? 

0:15:42.700 --> 0:15:43.40 
P4: 
Now. 

0:15:40.250 --> 0:15:48.640 
Moderator: 
So you mentioned like the move one wouldn't really work because you have to how you are there any other ones that you would be worried about patient filling it out at home? 

0:15:50.340 --> 0:15:55.50 
P4: 
I mean, those are ones we ask them and when they come in, we just mark what they tell us, you know. 

0:15:56.30 --> 0:15:56.220 
Moderator: 
OK. 

0:15:57.0 --> 0:16:10.820 
P4: 
Now, I think the depression and suicide one we should ask, maybe I think the PTSD one we should ask, umm, the military sexual trauma one. 

0:16:10.830 --> 0:16:14.280 
P4: 
We should probably keep for ourselves. Uh. 

0:16:19.970 --> 0:16:21.180 
P4: 
Also, are you now? 

0:16:21.190 --> 0:16:21.780 
P4: 
I don't know. 

0:16:23.540 --> 0:16:25.150 
P4: 
I don't really see anymore that I can. 

0:16:38.210 --> 0:16:38.350 
Moderator: 
Yeah. 

0:16:45.590 --> 0:16:45.840 
Moderator: 
Mm-hmm. 

0:16:28.510 --> 0:16:47.930 
P4: 
You know, because I think because the intimate partner violence, when some people don't, maybe they would be more apt to answer that in private on their own anyways than for us to be asking them at that person because, you know, some people have shame in that kind of thing and won't be truthful about it when you're asking them directly to their face anyhow. 

0:16:50.450 --> 0:16:51.110 
Moderator: 
Good insight. 

0:16:53.270 --> 0:16:58.860 
Moderator: 
My next question, I thank you kind of already covered, but I'm going to ask you and see if you want to expand upon it. 

0:16:58.930 --> 0:17:2.270 
Moderator: 
Have your workflows been affected either positively or negatively? 

0:17:4.970 --> 0:17:5.330 
Moderator: 
And how? 

0:17:5.90 --> 0:17:12.740 
P4: 
I don't think it's interfered with my workflow as just I've had more steps that I've had to do. 

0:17:13.940 --> 0:17:14.190 
Moderator: 
Yeah. 

0:17:14.330 --> 0:17:17.890 
P4: 
Because of the problems that it had created. 

0:17:22.670 --> 0:17:26.510 
Moderator: 
And come up with some more grounds to make it a system work. 

0:17:26.70 --> 0:17:27.330 
P4: 
Yeah, yeah. 

0:17:28.700 --> 0:17:34.100 
Moderator: 
Do you feel this process maintains an appropriate level of safety or clinical integrity and why? 

0:17:35.870 --> 0:17:36.240 
P4: 
Yeah. 

0:17:36.250 --> 0:17:52.890 
P4: 
I mean, I think it they're very capable of answering these questions in private on their own and some people probably may be more honest with answering the questions than having to answer to a nurse asking them it. 

0:17:55.310 --> 0:17:55.470 
Moderator: 
And. 

0:17:55.120 --> 0:18:0.980 
P4: 
Like a, especially if they wanted help with alcohol or tobacco, I don't know. 

0:18:0.990 --> 0:18:2.770 
P4: 
They might be more apt to be like. 

0:18:4.770 --> 0:18:9.180 
P4: 
Go better or more secure answering it privately, I don't know. 

0:18:9.980 --> 0:18:12.490 
Moderator: 
Umm, right. 

0:18:13.240 --> 0:18:17.80 
Moderator: 
And then was your data entry simplified? 

0:18:18.800 --> 0:18:18.970 
P4: 
No 

0:18:23.130 --> 0:18:29.60 
Moderator: 
And did you notice a decrease or increase in the notifications you receive about clinical reminders? 

0:18:32.490 --> 0:18:33.420 
P4: 
I don't really. 

0:18:33.430 --> 0:18:34.110 
P4: 
I've never really. I don't really ever see notifications about clinical reminders needing to be done. 

0:18:41.430 --> 0:18:41.690 
Moderator: 
Yeah. 

0:18:41.190 --> 0:18:42.120 
P4: 
It's just what? 

 
What I do every day with everybody that comes in, you know, in their chart. 

0:18:51.650 --> 0:18:52.160 
P4: 
Right. 

0:18:46.750 --> 0:18:53.420 
Moderator: 
So like even in CPRS of like you need to do these things, I would count that as a notification to. 

 
I mean, that's just part of my job.I know when I take them in the room, that's what I need to. 
That's my accomplishment when I'm in there. 

0:18:58.850 --> 0:19:7.460 
Moderator: 
OK, though those things that pop up, did this have any impact in those, the number of things that you said to see in CPRS to do? 

0:19:14.650 --> 0:19:16.40 
P4: 
And me, I don't know. 

0:19:16.610 --> 0:19:27.310 
P4: 
I guess with my notifications I have to just weed through now because these unsigned health prevention E screen notes sit in there for me.So I just have to let them sit there, see if they're coming in for the day.If they're not, then let them sit there and try not to look at them so they don't uncheck them. 

0:19:44.170 --> 0:19:48.870 
Moderator: 
So it sounds like that's a little more complicated because then you have to check and tell a couple places. 

0:19:49.660 --> 0:19:57.490 
P4: 
Yeah, I have to go through my notifications and weed out what's new and what's my unsigned health prevention any screen notes are sitting there waiting for me. 

0:20:0.730 --> 0:20:4.300 
Moderator: 
So overall, would you agree or disagree with the following statement? 

0:20:4.640 --> 0:20:7.400 
Moderator: 
Overall clinical reminder burden has been reduced. 

0:20:8.550 --> 0:20:8.730 
P4: 
Now. 

0:20:11.180 --> 0:20:15.800 
Moderator: 
And how much time would you estimate has been saved or added? 

0:20:17.300 --> 0:20:21.570 
Moderator: 
She it to your workflow by collecting these clinical reminder responses prior to the appointment. 

0:20:23.410 --> 0:20:23.910 
P4: 
Umm. 

0:20:26.200 --> 0:20:27.620 
P4: 
It's staggeringly added more work. 

0:20:29.530 --> 0:20:30.200 
P4: 
It hasn't. 

0:20:29.400 --> 0:20:30.390 
Moderator: 
And if you had a. 

0:20:30.210 --> 0:20:31.570 
P4: 
It hasn't improved it. 

0:20:32.880 --> 0:20:35.620 
Moderator: 
If you had to put a time estimate on that, and so how much has it added? 

0:20:35.260 --> 0:20:36.180 
P4: 
Ah. 

0:20:38.50 --> 0:20:41.180 
P4: 
Well, every day I go in there and I tried it. 

0:20:41.190 --> 0:20:50.730 
P4: 
Well, I was doing that every day going into the escreen and seeing who had an appointment for the day and which ones I needed to send to my notifications. 

0:20:52.490 --> 0:20:56.320 
P4: 
  

0:21:1.890 --> 0:21:3.300 
P4: 
Ever out my workload. 

0:21:6.850 --> 0:21:8.110 
P4: 
Maybe 10 minutes daily. 

0:21:9.200 --> 0:21:9.460 
Moderator: 
OK. 

0:21:10.250 --> 0:21:11.670 
P4: 
And it's not significant. 

0:21:13.870 --> 0:21:14.990 
Moderator: 
Put it in something, OK? 

0:21:15.180 --> 0:21:15.440 
P4: 
Yeah. 

0:21:16.930 --> 0:21:24.920 
Moderator: 
So you already mentioned about making sure that we don't trigger an encounter, but how else could you screening be improved or changed? 

0:21:28.110 --> 0:21:29.200 
P4: 
Like I had mentioned earlier. 

0:21:33.0 --> 0:21:41.340 
P4: 
Taking off the peoples that are sitting there pending that have already been passed their appointment date and have not completed the screen. 

0:21:42.40 --> 0:21:45.40 
P4: 
Umm, I don't have a lot of people doing the escreening. 

0:21:45.610 --> 0:21:55.240 
P4: 
I maybe on average when I send a week out, maybe get five people that completed it out of 25. 

0:21:55.830 --> 0:21:56.30 
Moderator: 
OK. 

0:21:57.160 --> 0:21:57.810 
P4: 
Umm. 

0:22:0.490 --> 0:22:8.750 
P4: 
And then it just if they reschedule, then we have to delete that onside health prevention escreening note. 

0:22:8.840 --> 0:22:13.140 
P4: 
Then we have to, you know, then they have to get another one. 

0:22:15.190 --> 0:22:23.100 
P4: 
Because if we don't delete the East screen note it sits there like it's an encounter, and then they're redoing work that's unnecessary. 

0:22:26.590 --> 0:22:26.770 
Moderator: 
No. 

0:22:25.630 --> 0:22:27.90 
P4: 
You know, because we have to resend it. 

0:22:28.680 --> 0:22:29.210 
P4: 
And. 

0:22:33.750 --> 0:22:35.500 
P4: 
That would be that's an issue. 

0:22:36.70 --> 0:22:36.900 
P4: 
What else? 

0:22:36.990 --> 0:22:38.380 
P4: 
Uh, did I say earlier? 

0:22:47.530 --> 0:22:49.240 
P4: 
Oh, there was an issue in East screen. 

0:22:49.250 --> 0:22:53.300 
P4: 
So if I wanted to resend and E screen. 

0:22:56.270 --> 0:22:56.610 
P4: 
Umm. 

0:22:57.790 --> 0:22:59.890 
P4: 
And they only had their cell number in there. 

0:23:1.0 --> 0:23:7.460 
P4: 
It won't let you resend one without the cell phone or phone number and an email address. 

0:23:8.780 --> 0:23:9.140 
Moderator: 
OK. 

0:23:9.430 --> 0:23:10.880 
P4: 
Both of them have to be in there. 

0:23:10.890 --> 0:23:12.100 
P4: 
It won't let you resend. 

0:23:12.570 --> 0:23:17.40 
P4: 
Then I started thinking I'm like, well, this is only going to people's email addresses. 

0:23:17.50 --> 0:23:20.320 
P4: 
It's not going to their cell phones, correct? 

0:23:21.830 --> 0:23:22.770 
Moderator: 
It was supposed to be. 

0:23:22.110 --> 0:23:23.860 
P4: 
Like through like a text. 

0:23:23.870 --> 0:23:26.350 
P4: 
If they're not getting text to finish these questionnaires. 

0:23:26.970 --> 0:23:28.530 
Moderator: 
They were supposed to be able to get both. 

0:23:30.820 --> 0:23:31.330 
P4: 
OK. 

0:23:31.540 --> 0:23:33.550 
P4: 
So then that must be the issue. 

0:23:33.560 --> 0:23:37.470 
P4: 
If they don't have an email or a cell phone, it won't, and both of them are in there. 

0:23:37.480 --> 0:23:38.640 
P4: 
It won't let you resend one. 

0:23:39.240 --> 0:23:45.940 
Moderator: 
But that only happened for reason you didn't get anything for the first time, like the first time around when you first created it was OK and I went. 

0:23:45.270 --> 0:23:52.40 
P4: 
Well, right, and this was on, I was just resetting on because they didn't complete it. 

0:23:52.540 --> 0:23:52.900 
Moderator: 
Aye. 

0:23:52.590 --> 0:23:54.820 
P4: 
So I don't know if they were getting it at all. 

0:23:55.230 --> 0:23:56.140 
P4: 
You know what I mean? 

0:23:56.980 --> 0:23:57.140 
Moderator: 
Yeah. 

0:23:56.310 --> 0:24:0.660 
P4: 
What it you don't know if one was one made it to them or not. 

0:24:1.750 --> 0:24:3.180 
Moderator: 
Did you hear any? 

0:24:3.610 --> 0:24:8.630 
Moderator: 
Well, in general either about this or anything, what was the veteran feedback that you heard? 

0:24:10.470 --> 0:24:10.850 
Moderator: 
If any. 

0:24:9.930 --> 0:24:14.70 
P4: 
I actually got no feedback from any of that Terrans in regard to it. 

0:24:15.70 --> 0:24:15.230 
Moderator: 
And. 

0:24:19.490 --> 0:24:22.180 
Moderator: 
Any other improvements are change ideas? 

0:24:26.980 --> 0:24:27.230 
P4: 
Me. 

0:24:27.240 --> 0:24:29.430 
P4: 
Look here I wrote some notes down. 

0:24:53.300 --> 0:24:55.230 
P4: 
No, I really can't think of anything else. 

0:24:55.920 --> 0:24:56.240 
Moderator: 
Right. 

0:24:55.360 --> 0:24:57.50 
P4: 
That that I haven't mentioned already. 

0:24:58.530 --> 0:25:7.720 
Moderator: 
OK, so out of everything that you listed for changes or improvements, if you can only pick one of those to actually do umm, what would it be? 

0:25:8.810 --> 0:25:10.370 
Moderator: 
What would make the biggest impact to you? 

0:25:11.870 --> 0:25:13.330 
P4: 
Not creating that encounter. 

0:25:17.780 --> 0:25:23.340 
Moderator: 
Now, is there anything else that we haven't talked about today about this pilot that you wanted to share with me? 

0:25:25.860 --> 0:25:28.200 
P4: 
Now, now I think I covered everything. 

0:25:29.670 --> 0:25:30.40 
Moderator: 
OK. 

0:25:30.990 --> 0:25:34.510 
Moderator: 
Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. 

0:25:34.670 --> 0:25:45.940 
Moderator: 
So I will umm, the plan for the pilot is you're going to flip to the other tool and then we were hoping at the end of that period to do another interview. 

0:25:48.170 --> 0:25:49.630 
P4: 
The two OK. 

0:25:45.950 --> 0:25:50.540 
Moderator: 
So we'll be able to compare and contrast, yeah, compare the two. 

0:25:50.710 --> 0:25:56.580 
Moderator: 
So you'll probably be hearing out for me in a, you know, a couple months again to do something similar like this just on the other tool. 

0:25:57.200 --> 0:25:57.460 
P4: 
OK. 

0:25:58.840 --> 0:26:8.120 
Moderator: 
So this is really, really helpful and this will help us evaluate the different tools and make sure that we can improve the process and make sure it works for staff and veterans. 

0:26:8.540 --> 0:26:8.760 
P4: 
Yeah. 

0:26:8.130 --> 0:26:9.30 
Moderator: 
So thank you so much. 

0:26:9.620 --> 0:26:10.20 
P4: 
All right. 

0:26:10.30 --> 0:26:10.390 
P4: 
Thank you. 

0:26:10.400 --> 0:26:10.980 
P4: 
You're welcome. 

0:26:11.520 --> 0:26:12.840 
Moderator: 
Enjoy the rest of your day. Bye. 

0:26:12.680 --> 0:26:13.600 
P4: 
You too. Bye.
