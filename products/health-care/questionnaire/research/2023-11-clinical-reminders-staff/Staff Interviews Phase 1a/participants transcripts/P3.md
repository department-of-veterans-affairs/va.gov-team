Burning the tool and what that was like for you. 

0:0:3.880 --> 0:0:4.240 
P3:  
OK. 

0:0:3.740 --> 0:0:14.920 
Moderator: 
So on a scale from one to five, with one being very easy and five being very difficult, how easy or difficult was it to learn how to use E screening? 

0:0:16.510 --> 0:0:17.530 
P3:  
I would give it A2. 

0:0:19.330 --> 0:0:19.660 
Moderator: 
OK. 

0:0:21.270 --> 0:0:24.800 
Moderator: 
And how long would you say it took you to learn how to use the tool? 

0:0:26.920 --> 0:0:29.740 
P3:  
Ohh probably 15 minutes. 

0:0:32.980 --> 0:0:35.110 
Moderator: 
And can you describe your onboarding process? 

0:0:37.990 --> 0:0:51.620 
P3:  
Umm, so we had a meeting with everyone in the beginning explaining what E screening was, but the questions I think had not been loaded into the system. 

0:0:51.630 --> 0:0:56.980 
P3:  
So it was very vague and everyone was very confused as what was this gonna be all about? 

0:1:5.570 --> 0:1:5.750 
Moderator: 
OK. 

0:1:13.620 --> 0:1:13.940 
Moderator: 
Umm. 

0:0:57.300 --> 0:1:14.500 
P3:  
But then about a week later, everything got loaded in and we kind of taught ourselves at our desk, you know, with its, I think for everyone it was easier to learn by doing rather than just being talked to about it in a conference room. 

0:1:14.830 --> 0:1:23.30 
P3:  
And it made a lot more sense once everything was loaded in and we were able to practice with actual patients and not like test patients. 

0:1:24.10 --> 0:1:24.250 
Moderator: 
OK. 

0:1:32.940 --> 0:1:33.160 
P3:  
Mm-hmm. 

0:1:26.500 --> 0:1:37.10 
Moderator: 
And if you could change one thing and you already mentioned that you wanted to have actual examples, but if you could change one thing about onboarding or training that you received, what would it be? 

0:1:40.200 --> 0:1:49.550 
P3:  
Umm just I guess that it have been more definitive, more set up when we had our original training really that's all. 

0:1:51.220 --> 0:1:57.30 
Moderator: 
Has there been any point in the process past that initial part that a training or a document or something? 

0:1:58.140 --> 0:1:58.680 
Moderator: 
Umm. 

0:1:59.60 --> 0:2:1.580 
Moderator: 
What have been helpful to solve a problem that came about? 

0:2:2.750 --> 0:2:18.540 
P3:  
No, I think we had the we had the teams chat that we used and anytime a question came up, we could just jump on that and put in our question and somebody was always pretty quick to respond. 

0:2:18.970 --> 0:2:20.880 
P3:  
You know how we should address that issue? 

0:2:22.390 --> 0:2:25.180 
P3:  
So I think that for me at least, that was plenty. 

0:2:25.190 --> 0:2:30.560 
P3:  
I did not need, you know, any kind of written manual or anything like that. 

0:2:30.570 --> 0:2:36.960 
P3:  
Just having people out there, we could reach out to I think was really helpful and we had the weekly huddles too. 

0:2:36.970 --> 0:2:42.550 
P3:  
If we had questions, we could save up umm in the beginning. 

0:2:42.560 --> 0:2:45.470 
P3:  
I think a lot of the people use those huddles. 

0:2:45.480 --> 0:2:54.320 
P3:  
I I know in the last few weeks we haven't been, you know, going on them because everybody's got it down by now, yeah. 

0:2:53.40 --> 0:2:59.250 
Moderator: 
You feel good now, so then how many weeks would you say that that was really super helpful to have those huddles? 

0:3:1.740 --> 0:3:2.100 
Moderator: 
Person. 

0:3:0.340 --> 0:3:3.880 
P3:  
The first two definitely, yeah, yeah. 

0:3:4.0 --> 0:3:11.940 
Moderator: 
And how often would you say that you actually put something in that Channel to get feedback on or to have somebody answer a question? 

0:3:11.890 --> 0:3:14.550 
P3:  
I personally probably did about three times. 

0:3:15.610 --> 0:3:17.960 
Moderator: 
And I just wanted. 

0:3:17.470 --> 0:3:18.880 
P3:  
But you know, then you also. 

0:3:19.860 --> 0:3:20.500 
Moderator: 
Oh no, the Hun. 

0:3:18.990 --> 0:3:25.430 
P3:  
Sorry, you have your coworkers around you, and I know, like my LPN and the other MSA across from me. 

0:3:25.440 --> 0:3:29.410 
P3:  
They probably used it another three times as well, so. 

0:3:31.320 --> 0:3:31.770 
Moderator: 
Great. 

0:3:32.60 --> 0:3:33.880 
Moderator: 
Now I just want to confirm. 

0:3:32.260 --> 0:3:34.10 
P3:  
I think I was. 

0:3:34.160 --> 0:3:39.730 
P3:  
Sorry, I was just gonna say I think just one person from each team was going to do an interview. 

0:3:39.740 --> 0:3:47.0 
P3:  
So that's why I kind of wanted to give you, umm, what they, you know, probably as much as they have used it as well. 

0:3:48.200 --> 0:3:48.540 
Moderator: 
Yeah. 

0:3:51.40 --> 0:3:51.300 
P3:  
OK. 

0:3:48.550 --> 0:3:52.470 
Moderator: 
Any feedback that you have heard from other people in your group? 

0:3:52.480 --> 0:3:53.320 
Moderator: 
Yes, definitely. 

0:3:53.330 --> 0:3:54.490 
Moderator: 
Feel free to share that with us. 

0:3:54.500 --> 0:3:55.710 
Moderator: 
That would be tremendously helpful. 

0:3:55.860 --> 0:4:4.180 
Moderator: 
We are interviewing a couple other people, but I think they're like LPNS and different roles in your at your location. 

0:4:4.640 --> 0:4:6.290 
P3:  
Right at our location. 

0:4:8.810 --> 0:4:8.970 
Moderator: 
Yeah. 

0:4:6.300 --> 0:4:15.200 
P3:  
But just for each like pack team, there's four of us in a pack team, and then they wanted at least one from each pack team to do an interview. 

0:4:18.660 --> 0:4:19.380 
Moderator: 
The pack team. 

0:4:15.560 --> 0:4:21.480 
P3:  
So if I say we I'm talking about our whole team, the four of us, yes, yes. 

0:4:21.170 --> 0:4:21.780 
Moderator: 
Great. 

0:4:21.790 --> 0:4:22.870 
Moderator: 
That's that's great. 

0:4:22.880 --> 0:4:23.550 
Moderator: 
Yeah, definitely. 

0:4:30.490 --> 0:4:30.790 
P3:  
OK. 

0:4:24.920 --> 0:4:33.10 
Moderator: 
Let me know when you're speak to everything from the acting, but let me know when it's something that you've personally observed versus something that came feedback from them too. 

0:4:33.700 --> 0:4:33.960 
P3:  
OK. 

0:4:33.280 --> 0:4:34.50 
Moderator: 
But we wanna hear it all. 

0:4:36.260 --> 0:4:39.960 
Moderator: 
I just want to confirm to you I'm pretty sure cause of your role. 

0:4:40.10 --> 0:4:43.270 
Moderator: 
You weren't involved in the configuring of the tool, correct? 

0:4:43.820 --> 0:4:44.160 
P3:  
Correct. 

0:4:47.140 --> 0:4:52.90 
Moderator: 
My next set of questions is going to be actually utilizing the tool and how that go. 

0:4:52.210 --> 0:4:53.820 
Moderator: 
So can you walk me through? So after a couple of weeks and you'll get used to the system.What was your final process that you used for sending, receiving and reviewing these questionnaires? 

0:5:3.850 --> 0:5:8.440 
P3:  
I put a a calendar reminder on for every Friday. I would create to create my battery and I would go into the Escreening, have that saved in my favorites, bring up the page, create my battery for all the clinics that I wanted, the E screening to go out to. I would do that on Friday and then it was funny. 
Immediately you would get responses and most of our responses came in that day. I would say that the battery went out. I don't know if because they get an email on their phone or notification and then they open it and they do it, pretty much the ones that that completed their E screening. It was done that day and then so that would be for the following week. then you would wait until Monday, uh, before patients are coming in to open up the tool. Check the dashboard to see if anyone's completed and if anyone had completed it that day then we would and this is where the process changed a little from the beginning to the end. 
	In the beginning, we would save the note right away to Vista. Yeah, save the note and wait for the LPN to sign it. When she had the patient there, But we ran into problems later on down the road where if patients cancelled and they had completed an east screening and we had saved it to their chart, then you had that note in there. it also would check patients in to their appointment on our scheduling platform. It looked like they had checked in for their appointment, so that didn't work very well for us. then we would wait until the veteran actually had checked in for their appointment at central scheduling, and then we would save the note to Vista just to avoid that. Is he here? Is he not here? Is it because we completed the note? So that would then I would save it to Vista and then the LPN who you know that's I kind of wasn't involved in that part of it at all. She would sign that note, and then she wouldn't have to ask those intake questions when she had the veteran and the room. 

0:7:42.170 --> 0:7:49.860 
Moderator: 
So before you made this switch, how did you correct like the notes that were pushed that caused that?Did you like delete the note did you just deal with it? Like what was the process before? 

0:7:53.950 --> 0:7:55.380 
P3:  
Yeah, we had to reach out. You know in the chat and say, hey, we have this note saved and the veteran either rescheduled or no showed or can you get rid of it and? So that that's pretty much what we did for that process. Umm. 

0:8:11.390 --> 0:8:12.380 
Moderator: 
And who are you messaging? 

0:8:12.390 --> 0:8:15.770 
Moderator: 
The LPN or the OR or the PCP to. 

0:8:15.610 --> 0:8:16.80 
P3:  
No. 

0:8:23.960 --> 0:8:24.210 
Moderator: 
Umm. 

0:8:16.90 --> 0:8:25.530 
P3:  
We were messaging into the the E screening huddle in the teams like the the the support, uh group in the teams chat.We would just ask them to get rid of the note for us. Because.And they were able to do that out of the CPRS side. 

0:8:34.650 --> 0:8:35.740 
P3:  
Yes, yes. 

0:8:35.750 --> 0:8:37.160 
P3:  
We just didn't want it in there. 

0:8:37.170 --> 0:8:49.720 
P3:  
If he wasn't, you know, coming to the appointment to have that E screening note made it look like, I don't know, we just didn't want it in there because most of them they rescheduled. 

0:8:49.730 --> 0:8:53.570 
P3:  
And so then we wanted the E screening note attached to that appointment. 

0:8:55.660 --> 0:8:55.790 
Moderator: 
And. 

0:8:55.200 --> 0:8:56.470 
P3:  
So it got a little. 

0:8:56.480 --> 0:8:59.750 
P3:  
Yeah, that part of it was difficult for sure. 

0:9:0.930 --> 0:9:5.570 
Moderator: 
But then once you made this switch, how did that impact workflow? 

0:9:5.580 --> 0:9:9.980 
Moderator: 
Because that meant that you had to do something closer to the appointment time, correct? 

0:9:10.50 --> 0:9:10.680 
P3:  
Yeah. 

0:9:10.730 --> 0:9:15.340 
P3:  
So that's you know, that's where it would get forgotten sometimes. 

0:9:16.100 --> 0:9:16.260 
Moderator: 
OK. 

0:9:15.670 --> 0:9:22.540 
P3:  
So the so I think we had one yesterday where the LPN said Ohh I forgot to do his E screening. 

0:9:22.550 --> 0:9:34.410 
P3:  
No, because you know you get rushed in the day the veteran checks in, she runs, you know, and then it just is forgotten, even though we've written it on our schedule that he has a completed E screening. 

0:9:45.280 --> 0:9:45.420 
Moderator: 
Yeah. 

0:9:35.370 --> 0:9:49.690 
P3:  
We would forget to save it to Vista because we had to wait until they were physically in the building to save it to Vista because it was checking them in on the scheduling program. 

0:9:51.300 --> 0:9:55.550 
P3:  
I don't know if you're familiar with the Vista scheduling package. 

0:10:0.10 --> 0:10:0.260 
P3:  
Yes. 

0:10:0.320 --> 0:10:0.400 
P3:  
Yes. 

0:10:0.320 --> 0:10:1.780 
Moderator: 
The LPN, or BSN, ECS. 

0:10:4.620 --> 0:10:5.360 
Moderator: 
Yeah. OK. 

0:10:2.360 --> 0:10:5.790 
P3:  
Yes, the Vista gooey VSC era. 

0:10:5.840 --> 0:10:6.490 
P3:  
Yeah. 

0:10:6.540 --> 0:10:9.360 
P3:  
So when you check in it, it turns yellow. 

0:10:10.750 --> 0:10:23.130 
P3:  
So if I saved the note to Vista, it would turn them yellow like they've checked in, and when the LPN signed the note, they would turn orange like they were checked out. 

0:10:23.480 --> 0:10:34.560 
P3:  
So if she did that ahead of time, they would come in to their appointment to central scheduling and it was confusing to the girls up there because they would say ohh he's checked out of his appointment. 

0:10:34.570 --> 0:10:35.190 
P3:  
Well, what is? 

0:10:36.580 --> 0:10:36.780 
Moderator: 
Yeah. 

0:10:35.200 --> 0:10:37.950 
P3:  
You know, it was it caused a lot of confusion. 

0:10:38.490 --> 0:10:44.20 
P3:  
So we did have to wait until we saw they were checked in and then we would go through the process. 

0:10:44.30 --> 0:10:51.850 
P3:  
But by doing that, a couple of them did get missed because it when the business of the day you would mess a few of them. 

0:10:52.410 --> 0:11:3.150 
Moderator: 
Where in BSCS or or VSC GUI where you writing that they had one because you said you were nodding and scheduling. 

0:11:1.450 --> 0:11:8.170 
P3:  
On we actually print a schedule in the morning and we all keep one at our desk. Oops. 

0:11:19.100 --> 0:11:19.760 
P3:  
That was weird. 

0:11:21.180 --> 0:11:21.940 
P3:  
I lost you. 

0:11:22.480 --> 0:11:24.510 
Moderator: 
Oh, I was like, you looked OK to me. 

0:11:24.900 --> 0:11:25.790 
Moderator: 
I'm glad you. 

0:11:26.820 --> 0:11:27.280 
Moderator: 
We're back. 

0:11:25.0 --> 0:11:27.430 
P3:  
Ohh OK yeah, no. 

0:11:27.480 --> 0:11:31.110 
P3:  
OK, So what we're what were you asking? 

0:11:31.520 --> 0:11:32.80 
P3:  
Umm. 

0:11:31.840 --> 0:11:35.240 
Moderator: 
The where do you actually know in the scheduling that they had something? 

0:11:32.600 --> 0:11:36.690 
P3:  
Ohh yeah, we just wrote it on our schedule for the day. 

0:11:36.700 --> 0:11:51.900 
P3:  
We always make little notes and we have a morning huddle and we would get together and say, OK, these three patients completed their E screening today and we would just write it on there and then it would have to be just us remembering between myself and the LPN. 

0:11:52.790 --> 0:11:52.990 
Moderator: 
OK. 

0:11:54.980 --> 0:12:3.870 
Moderator: 
So on a scale from one to five, again, one being very easy and five being very difficult, how easy or difficult was it to use E screening? 

0:12:5.720 --> 0:12:7.130 
P3:  
Oh, I would give it a one. 

0:12:7.140 --> 0:12:7.840 
P3:  
It's very easy. 

0:12:9.950 --> 0:12:18.270 
Moderator: 
And do you think that the has the quality of the time spent with the patient improved or worsened due to this process and why? 

0:12:30.280 --> 0:12:30.520 
Moderator: 
OK. 

0:12:20.300 --> 0:12:34.780 
P3:  
I would say the way the pilot was set up with just a few clinical reminders that were in there, it worsened that as far as it didn't save us anytime, it it made us spend more time. We talked about it, we said if all the clinical reminders were in there, and the veterans actually completed all the reminders before and did their rescreening, that could be a great tool. But the way the pilot was set up with just maybe they answered two questions, the amount of work that goes into just getting, you know your tobacco use or you know the questions that were asked and answered. My LPN said, that â€˜takes me 10 seconds to ask, document move on, so and then you also have the two notes in there, the eScreening note plus her note S0 two separate notes in there to be reviewed. So we felt like it really it didn't save any time just because of the way the pilot didn't have enough questions built in. 

0:13:29.920 --> 0:13:32.20 
Moderator: 
Right now, did you just? 

0:13:35.110 --> 0:13:35.330 
P3:  
Mm-hmm. 

0:13:32.300 --> 0:13:35.400 
Moderator: 
You said if it had all of them, but is there. 

0:13:35.630 --> 0:13:37.0 
Moderator: 
Did you talk amongst your group? 

0:13:37.10 --> 0:13:40.240 
Moderator: 
Is there any that you wouldn't want in there and want to do in person? 

0:13:41.430 --> 0:13:43.20 
P3:  
No, we thought it. 

0:13:43.70 --> 0:13:44.820 
P3:  
No, we didn't really talk like that. 

0:13:44.830 --> 0:13:54.600 
P3:  
We just said if there had been more of the questions built in, so she didn't have to ask so many in the room, it would have saved time. 

0:13:55.70 --> 0:14:1.290 
P3:  
But because you know they only used like two or three questions, I think in the beginning there were four questions. 

0:14:2.740 --> 0:14:2.970 
Moderator: 
Umm. 

0:14:2.370 --> 0:14:9.690 
P3:  
There was the sexual orientation question, which it was our patient that had a problem with that question. 

0:14:9.700 --> 0:14:15.10 
P3:  
Then it got taken out and so then there were only three possible three questions that were being asked. 

0:14:15.880 --> 0:14:19.480 
P3:  
So you know, and they're only asked if they're due to be asked. 

0:14:28.190 --> 0:14:28.330 
Moderator: 
Yeah. 

0:14:19.490 --> 0:14:30.710 
P3:  
So if he's coming in for a 6 month follow up and he just had one or two clinical reminders, you know, then it just didn't save a lot of time. 

0:14:30.730 --> 0:14:32.520 
P3:  
With those just answering 2 questions. 

0:14:33.400 --> 0:14:33.770 
Moderator: 
OK. 

0:14:34.380 --> 0:14:35.70 
Moderator: 
That makes sense. 

0:14:35.300 --> 0:14:41.610 
Moderator: 
So but besides what you just mentioned, was there any other impacts to your workflow, either positive or negatively? 

0:14:43.930 --> 0:14:47.540 
P3:  
Umm, I mean again negative, negatively. 

0:14:47.550 --> 0:14:49.900 
P3:  
Another issue, I'm sorry. 

0:14:50.380 --> 0:14:50.730 
Moderator: 
Oh, no. 

0:14:50.740 --> 0:14:52.270 
Moderator: 
That's why we're doing these interviews. 

0:14:49.910 --> 0:15:0.890 
P3:  
Another issue, Umm was and maybe this would be different if the entire organization was using a screening. 

0:15:1.180 --> 0:15:13.730 
P3:  
I think it would have definitely been different, but the way it's set up with just the pack team, we're the only ones built into there that could sign the notes. 

0:15:13.830 --> 0:15:25.490 
P3:  
So it had to be if my LPN, who works four of the five days on the day she was off Tuesday, the LPN covering for her could not sign her notes. 

0:15:25.500 --> 0:15:35.550 
P3:  
It had to be our RN who was built in to sign a note and if RNRN wasn't around, you know she's off doing an infusion or something. 

0:15:42.580 --> 0:15:42.910 
Moderator: 
Thank you. 

0:15:42.920 --> 0:15:43.620 
Moderator: 
Check your problem. 

0:15:35.560 --> 0:15:44.750 
P3:  
She's not there to sign the note, and again we couldn't do the notes in the morning because of the toll check in and. Yeah. 

0:15:44.830 --> 0:15:45.360 
P3:  
Yeah. 

0:15:45.370 --> 0:15:45.920 
P3:  
So. 

0:15:47.480 --> 0:15:47.870 
Moderator: 
And then. 

0:15:46.890 --> 0:16:0.940 
P3:  
So I think if if if the whole you know VA was using it then anyone covering for our LPN would have access to go in and sign the E screening note, whoever was rooming that patient. 

0:16:1.480 --> 0:16:2.90 
Moderator: 
That makes sense. 

0:16:0.990 --> 0:16:3.230 
P3:  
But just the way the the pilot. 

0:16:3.240 --> 0:16:5.580 
P3:  
Yeah, was caused a few issues. 

0:16:5.590 --> 0:16:8.210 
P3:  
Just by the way you know it was set up. 

0:16:9.50 --> 0:16:12.580 
Moderator: 
OK, now for the questions that didn't get answered. 

0:16:12.590 --> 0:16:19.180 
Moderator: 
The responses that were filtered in, do you feel this process maintained an appropriate level of safety or clinical integrity? 

0:16:21.910 --> 0:16:22.710 
P3:  
Yes, yes. 

0:16:24.860 --> 0:16:25.10 
Moderator: 
Why? 

0:16:24.990 --> 0:16:25.150 
P3:  
Yeah. 

0:16:27.380 --> 0:16:36.670 
P3:  
Well, I, I mean, I'm not really involved in that, that aspect where when a question is asked, I see how they react. 

0:16:36.780 --> 0:16:42.570 
P3:  
But I think they probably are more truthful when they're at home with an email answering. 

0:16:42.580 --> 0:16:44.290 
P3:  
That's what we thought anyway. 

0:16:44.300 --> 0:16:52.280 
P3:  
Then how they might answer umm to the LPN face to face so. 

0:16:53.860 --> 0:16:57.590 
Moderator: 
Now this I think I'm gonna ask you again, but I'm pretty sure you've already covered it. 

0:16:57.700 --> 0:16:59.840 
Moderator: 
Was your data entry simplified? 

0:17:2.840 --> 0:17:3.410 
P3:  
Umm. 

0:17:3.420 --> 0:17:4.790 
P3:  
As far as versus? 

0:17:13.130 --> 0:17:13.390 
P3:  
No. 

0:17:6.720 --> 0:17:14.460 
Moderator: 
Versus the process that you used to have to be involved in with clinical reminders, did this streamline down our entry? 

0:17:15.470 --> 0:17:16.590 
Moderator: 
No, no, because really it's just to ask a question. Click the box, move on to the next question. 
So I don't think it's any simpler than that. 

0:17:27.210 --> 0:17:35.300 
Moderator: 
And have you noticed it decrease or increase in the notifications that you receive about clinical engineers from any system you deal with? 

0:17:42.120 --> 0:17:42.280 
Moderator: 
Yeah. 

0:17:36.610 --> 0:17:45.350 
P3:  
Unfortunately, I don't get the notification, so that's more on the LPN you when you interview with the LPN's, they'll be able to answer that better than I can. 

0:17:46.510 --> 0:17:46.630 
Moderator: 
And. 

0:17:48.620 --> 0:17:49.60 
Moderator: 
Umm. 

0:17:51.780 --> 0:17:56.420 
Moderator: 
How could ease screening tools be improved or changed? 

0:17:59.20 --> 0:18:16.600 
P3:  
Well, the whole check in that I mentioned so that if they if they complete the E screening and we save it to their chart, it doesn't check them into their appointment, that would be a, A the biggest change that would be positive change. 

0:18:17.430 --> 0:18:33.960 
P3:  
And then if there were all the clinical reminders built into the system and everyone using them in the VA so that multi, you know, different people could sign the notes, then I think it would be a, a, a good tool to use. 

0:18:43.480 --> 0:18:43.830 
Moderator: 
Umm. 

0:18:33.970 --> 0:18:52.220 
P3:  
But the way it just the pilot with you know was very limiting limiting and we could see where the benefits would be, but we just didn't really get to you know appreciate you know be able to use it to its full potential really with the pilot. 

0:18:54.470 --> 0:19:1.800 
Moderator: 
How much time would you estimate has been saved or added by collecting these clinical reminder responses? 

0:19:4.730 --> 0:19:9.380 
P3:  
Ohh I I mean it's under 15 minutes a day. 

0:19:9.390 --> 0:19:12.80 
P3:  
I would say that it added to us. 

0:19:12.960 --> 0:19:13.150 
Moderator: 
OK. 

0:19:14.750 --> 0:19:18.70 
Moderator: 
And but it definitely added some didn't subtract anything. Alright. 

0:19:17.280 --> 0:19:18.410 
P3:  
Right, right. 

0:19:19.980 --> 0:19:28.790 
Moderator: 
And you didn't list 2 ideas, but if you had to pick one for ways to improve, which one would you pick as the most important? 

0:19:30.110 --> 0:19:31.420 
Moderator: 
Or maybe there's nothing. Yeah. 

0:19:30.560 --> 0:19:33.510 
P3:  
Umm yeah, let me just looking over my notes. 

0:19:45.410 --> 0:19:56.660 
P3:  
Well, we haven't talked at all about U and I don't know if that for this question if this is appropriate, but a different way of sending the E screening out than email. 

0:19:59.40 --> 0:19:59.200 
Moderator: 
And. 

0:19:57.540 --> 0:20:2.790 
P3:  
Umm, like we've talked about text messaging or just a lot of people. 

0:20:8.860 --> 0:20:9.90 
Moderator: 
Umm. 

0:20:2.910 --> 0:20:13.800 
P3:  
We noticed a lot of ease screenings where they open the E screening and then closed it and didn't do anything with it or they answered one question. 

0:20:13.810 --> 0:20:18.120 
P3:  
So it was partially completed and I don't know why that is, but. 

0:20:19.240 --> 0:20:20.210 
P3:  
Uh, probably. 

0:20:26.0 --> 0:20:26.320 
Moderator: 
OK. 

0:20:20.220 --> 0:20:33.140 
P3:  
I would go back to them being the most helpful would be that whole check in not checking the veteran into the appointment by completing any screening by saving it to Vista I should say, yeah. 

0:20:34.660 --> 0:20:35.70 
Moderator: 
OK. 

0:20:35.120 --> 0:20:40.440 
Moderator: 
Was there any other trends that you saw on your side besides them clicking on it and doing 1? 

0:20:43.130 --> 0:20:44.380 
Moderator: 
Any veterinary notice? 

0:20:43.60 --> 0:20:52.110 
P3:  
Just the one trend I set about 95% of them, did it within an hour of the battery being sent out. 

0:20:52.950 --> 0:20:58.140 
P3:  
If we were, yeah, they didn't like, you know, it wasn't like, hey, did anymore do it throughout the week? 

0:20:58.190 --> 0:21:0.940 
P3:  
No, it was all like that Friday. 

0:21:5.70 --> 0:21:5.390 
Moderator: 
OK. 

0:21:1.330 --> 0:21:6.820 
P3:  
That would be where we got all our answers from so that we thought that was pretty interesting. 

0:21:9.350 --> 0:21:10.250 
Moderator: 
That is interesting. 

0:21:9.640 --> 0:21:14.770 
P3:  
Answer and surprised that a lot of veterans don't have email addresses. 

0:21:14.780 --> 0:21:18.800 
P3:  
So then not all the veterans were getting the E screening. 

0:21:18.890 --> 0:21:20.160 
P3:  
That was another thing. 

0:21:20.610 --> 0:21:29.900 
P3:  
So I think if this was gonna going to definitely be something we were going to do, we would have to make an effort to get email addresses in the system. 

0:21:30.310 --> 0:21:37.80 
P3:  
I think some veterans registered years ago and they've never updated and added email addresses. 

0:21:37.340 --> 0:21:37.620 
Moderator: 
Umm. 

0:21:37.490 --> 0:21:42.190 
P3:  
It's never really been a problem because that's not how we communicate here with veterans. 

0:21:42.590 --> 0:21:45.330 
P3:  
We use my healthy vet secure messaging. 

0:21:48.200 --> 0:21:51.960 
P3:  
You know, and telephone we we're not allowed to email a veterans. 

0:21:51.970 --> 0:21:59.570 
P3:  
So so a lot of them maybe don't have up to date email addresses in the system. 

0:22:0.630 --> 0:22:7.260 
Moderator: 
And is there anything else that you want to share with us that I haven't covered today? 

0:22:8.370 --> 0:22:9.0 
P3:  
Umm. 

0:22:11.490 --> 0:22:12.120 
P3:  
Think. 

0:22:21.250 --> 0:22:35.620 
P3:  
One thing was UM, if a veteran reschedule had completed the E screening but then rescheduled their appointment, the E screening, the date for the E screening never changed. 

0:22:35.630 --> 0:22:43.920 
P3:  
You know, it remained that original appointment date, so it they could be lost because we would forget that. 

0:22:43.930 --> 0:22:46.240 
P3:  
Ohh, that guy from 5 days ago. 

0:22:46.250 --> 0:22:51.440 
P3:  
He completed his E screening, but now he's coming in, you know, two weeks from now. 

0:22:51.450 --> 0:22:54.170 
P3:  
So to go back and find disease screening. 

0:22:55.180 --> 0:22:56.230 
P3:  
So that was another. 

0:22:58.790 --> 0:22:58.970 
Moderator: 
Was. 

0:22:56.240 --> 0:23:1.170 
P3:  
That was another thing we ran into is maybe if the system could update. 

0:23:13.590 --> 0:23:14.880 
Moderator: 
That was going to be my question. 

0:23:1.220 --> 0:23:15.610 
P3:  
I don't know how it could be linked, but if they if they rescheduled their appointment, of course they would get another ease screening if it went, you know, to the next week, but it would be, yeah. 

0:23:14.890 --> 0:23:16.190 
Moderator: 
I was like, is there a cut off? 

0:23:16.200 --> 0:23:20.780 
Moderator: 
Like if it was like 2 weeks out, did you not send the next one or? 

0:23:20.880 --> 0:23:27.310 
P3:  
No, we always just, I didn't get in to trying to filter out who completed and not send them another one. 

0:23:27.320 --> 0:23:31.450 
P3:  
We just sent the whole, you know, put in the date range from Monday to Friday. 

0:23:31.460 --> 0:23:34.730 
P3:  
Send not looking back to see. 

0:23:34.740 --> 0:23:36.500 
P3:  
Ohh, maybe I shouldn't send his. 

0:23:36.510 --> 0:23:37.560 
P3:  
He's already done it. 

0:23:37.570 --> 0:23:47.400 
P3:  
We honestly didn't get all because that would start adding too much time to the day trying to figure, you know, figure that out so. 

0:23:46.750 --> 0:23:54.100 
Moderator: 
Yeah, though I do wonder like, how long would that information be clinically relevant? 

0:23:58.320 --> 0:23:58.550 
P3:  
Mm-hmm. 

0:23:54.200 --> 0:24:0.140 
Moderator: 
So like is there if there's something we can do on our end to make that automatically do it.Like would you want it to be sent out every week? And because things can change, or it could it be 2 weeks? I don't know if you have any thoughts on that. 

0:24:9.910 --> 0:24:20.230 
P3:  
Well, with the questions that were being asked, I mean, I think 2 weeks would be fine that I don't think much is gonna change in two weeks. 

0:24:21.100 --> 0:24:24.960 
P3:  
 you know the tobacco abuse? 

0:24:24.970 --> 0:24:29.480 
P3:  
Maybe they've quit smoking within the last two weeks, but you know. 

0:24:29.490 --> 0:24:31.240 
P3:  
So yeah, I've two weeks. 

0:24:31.250 --> 0:24:33.740 
P3:  
I I don't think I would make a big difference. 

0:24:34.300 --> 0:24:36.620 
P3:  
So no. 

0:24:36.410 --> 0:24:36.740 
Moderator: 
Good. 

0:24:37.190 --> 0:24:44.870 
P3:  
Yeah, we did have like the first week, probably our biggest problem was that sexual orientation question. 

0:24:44.880 --> 0:24:50.470 
P3:  
And we had an older veteran get very offended, go up to our patient advocate. 

0:24:50.980 --> 0:25:1.0 
P3:  
And so then the question had to was taken out of the whole screening, I don't know if it was just for our facility, but yeah, they they took it out. 

0:25:1.10 --> 0:25:7.810 
P3:  
And so that was one that our LPN's were looking forward to ohgi don't have to ask that anymore. 

0:25:8.310 --> 0:25:22.560 
P3:  
And we felt that they would answer more honestly through any screening versus face to face with, you know, a 25 year old female, some of the older men would not feel comfortable answering that question face to face. 

0:25:22.570 --> 0:25:33.430 
P3:  
But he screening we thought was good for for the the more difficult questions, but then it had to get taken out because somebody took offense at the at the wording of the question. 

0:25:38.550 --> 0:25:38.750 
P3:  
Umm. 

0:25:34.10 --> 0:25:40.830 
Moderator: 
Yeah, I also know there was some technical things related to that question was also led to it being taken out as well. 

0:25:42.650 --> 0:25:42.900 
Moderator: 
Yeah. 

0:25:43.320 --> 0:25:43.500 
P3:  
Yeah. 

0:25:44.620 --> 0:25:46.90 
Moderator: 
Any other final thought? 

0:25:47.740 --> 0:26:13.250 
P3:  
Now, just mainly reiterating again if all of the reminders were in there, we think it could be a really nice tool, really a size, a time saver and if everyone was on board using it at the same time, it got to be a thing that you know, because we were also having to send out letters letting the veterans know that they're going to be getting an email. 

0:26:13.260 --> 0:26:20.0 
P3:  
But if it became over time, just something they got used to seeing, I think you would see him improvement there as well. 

0:26:20.730 --> 0:26:22.870 
Moderator: 
So actually tell me more about those letters. 

0:26:22.880 --> 0:26:24.650 
Moderator: 
When did you send those? 

0:26:24.660 --> 0:26:25.210 
Moderator: 
Like? How? 

0:26:27.240 --> 0:26:33.10 
Moderator: 
Did the veterans need to have scheduled so many days in advance to be set or what was the what was the process? 

0:26:33.510 --> 0:26:34.100 
P3:  
Yeah. 

0:26:34.110 --> 0:26:42.710 
P3:  
So we send out appointment reminder letters about three weeks before their appointments, telling them whether they need to get lab work or not. 

0:26:42.830 --> 0:26:45.460 
P3:  
And we just put it in with that letter. 

0:26:45.620 --> 0:26:49.620 
P3:  
So about they would get it two to three weeks before their appointment. 

0:26:49.630 --> 0:26:53.360 
P3:  
Just telling them that, hey, look out for this email. 

0:26:53.370 --> 0:26:54.740 
P3:  
It's a pilot project. 

0:26:54.750 --> 0:26:56.650 
P3:  
Would just like you to answer these questions. 

0:26:56.660 --> 0:26:58.700 
P3:  
That helps us, you know, for your healthcare. 

0:27:0.40 --> 0:27:0.610 
P3:  
Umm. 

0:27:0.50 --> 0:27:2.50 
Moderator: 
Yeah, with. 

0:27:1.330 --> 0:27:15.70 
P3:  
But like I said, I think 1 sippy came, something that with new patients you could say, hey, we do this and this is what this is about and explain it, it would just become second nature so. 

0:27:15.790 --> 0:27:16.360 
Moderator: 
Yeah. 

0:27:22.700 --> 0:27:22.950 
P3:  
How? 

0:27:22.960 --> 0:27:23.990 
P3:  
Sure, sure. 

0:27:16.450 --> 0:27:24.950 
Moderator: 
Would you by any chance be able to email me a copy of what the wording is in the letter, or just a like what the template was? 

0:27:24.40 --> 0:27:26.50 
P3:  
Yeah, it got built into our. 

0:27:26.140 --> 0:27:28.610 
P3:  
Yeah, I can print one and upload it to you. 

0:27:29.570 --> 0:27:29.710 
Moderator: 
Yeah. 

0:27:28.620 --> 0:27:31.370 
P3:  
If sure, do I have your email? 

0:27:31.420 --> 0:27:31.670 
P3:  
I'm not. 

0:27:35.110 --> 0:27:35.370 
P3:  
OK. 

0:27:32.300 --> 0:27:38.670 
Moderator: 
Umm, I think I'm I'm on the meeting invite, so I think if you just reply like any Nina, both of us would probably like to see it. 

0:27:39.360 --> 0:27:39.620 
P3:  
OK. 

0:27:38.680 --> 0:27:41.280 
Moderator: 
So you can just reply to the meeting invite and we'll we'll get it. 

0:27:41.310 --> 0:27:42.240 
P3:  
OK. Sure. 

0:27:42.730 --> 0:27:46.90 
P3:  
Yeah, we were just afraid they would be like, what is this? 

0:27:46.140 --> 0:27:49.30 
P3:  
A lot of them didn't know, you know, what is this? 

0:27:49.40 --> 0:27:50.340 
P3:  
What am I getting this for? 

0:27:50.350 --> 0:27:55.80 
P3:  
Because all of a sudden, out of the blue, they started getting the, you know, an email. 

0:27:55.350 --> 0:28:4.210 
P3:  
Some of them were a little leery and afraid to click on it as the spam, as the so we wanted to give them a little heads up that you're gonna be getting this. 

0:28:4.220 --> 0:28:5.850 
P3:  
And this is what it is and. 

0:28:6.580 --> 0:28:6.720 
Moderator: 
Yeah. 

0:28:7.960 --> 0:28:8.260 
P3:  
So. 

0:28:8.260 --> 0:28:17.290 
Moderator: 
Did you hear any other trends from the veterans of what they're they were saying about their experience related to filling these out? 

0:28:18.20 --> 0:28:19.800 
P3:  
I I really wasn't on that. 

0:28:19.810 --> 0:28:25.210 
P3:  
Again, that was probably the LPN's in the room, except for the one that had the issue. 

0:28:25.220 --> 0:28:26.680 
P3:  
The for it right in the beginning. 

0:28:27.90 --> 0:28:32.360 
P3:  
You know, he he brought it up to me that he was so offended by that question. 

0:28:32.430 --> 0:28:39.80 
P3:  
So I had that, but otherwise I didn't really have any interaction with the veterans saying, oh, this was the. 

0:28:39.90 --> 0:28:40.380 
P3:  
So I just would thank them. 

0:28:40.390 --> 0:28:42.520 
P3:  
Hey, thanks for doing the screening for us. 

0:28:42.530 --> 0:28:46.730 
P3:  
It really helps us and ohh sure you know, no problem. 

0:28:46.740 --> 0:28:50.80 
P3:  
I didn't really know what it was about, but I answered the questions. 

0:28:52.610 --> 0:28:52.770 
Moderator: 
Yeah. 

0:28:50.90 --> 0:28:53.520 
P3:  
You know, that's kind of the response, yeah. 

0:28:54.790 --> 0:28:54.990 
Moderator: 
OK. 

0:28:56.340 --> 0:28:58.990 
Moderator: 
Well, that is actually all the questions I have for you today. 

0:28:59.0 --> 0:29:0.910 
Moderator: 
So I can give you some time back. 

0:29:1.120 --> 0:29:5.610 
Moderator: 
So thank you so much and we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. 

0:29:5.960 --> 0:29:6.470 
Moderator: 
Your feedback? 

0:29:5.930 --> 0:29:6.870 
P3:  
Oh, sure, sure. 

0:29:7.440 --> 0:29:16.360 
Moderator: 
Yeah, I was like this will definitely help us as we continue to evaluate the tools in this pilot and make sure that the process works for staff and veterans. 

0:29:17.210 --> 0:29:17.470 
P3:  
OK. 

0:29:17.480 --> 0:29:18.80 
P3:  
And I did have. 

0:29:17.360 --> 0:29:18.210 
Moderator: 
So we do. 

0:29:18.700 --> 0:29:19.210 
Moderator: 
Yeah, go ahead. 

0:29:19.10 --> 0:29:23.340 
P3:  
I'm sorry I had one more question was how much longer is the program? 

0:29:23.430 --> 0:29:25.520 
P3:  
Do we continue to do the batteries? 

0:29:25.530 --> 0:29:32.260 
P3:  
We weren't sure how many we were told sometime like the end of January, but there was never a date really given an end date given. 

0:29:33.90 --> 0:29:40.40 
Moderator: 
I will go and talk to our coordinator because there will be an end date and then we, umm, we're talking about flipping to the other tool. 

0:29:40.470 --> 0:29:40.890 
P3:  
Right. 

0:29:43.800 --> 0:29:43.980 
P3:  
OK. 

0:29:40.250 --> 0:29:44.560 
Moderator: 
So then you would experience the other tools so you could do a comparison and see which one. 

0:29:44.570 --> 0:29:49.130 
Moderator: 
Actually, if the process is better or worse with one or the other, umm. 

0:29:49.450 --> 0:29:55.260 
Moderator: 
So I will reach out and make sure that somebody at the next sync with your site brings that up and reiterates that. 

0:29:55.570 --> 0:29:56.850 
Moderator: 
So there isn't there? 

0:30:4.980 --> 0:30:5.440 
P3:  
OK. 

0:30:5.490 --> 0:30:8.420 
P3:  
And then will there be like a new training for that new tool? 

0:30:9.50 --> 0:30:9.170 
Moderator: 
Yes. 

0:30:10.140 --> 0:30:11.250 
P3:  
OK, OK. 

0:30:11.490 --> 0:30:11.610 
Moderator: 
Yeah. 

0:30:11.760 --> 0:30:17.390 
P3:  
So we just weren't sure because like I said, we were told the end of February or end of January. 

0:30:17.400 --> 0:30:20.650 
P3:  
So we weren't sure this Friday, do we send it out again? 

0:30:20.660 --> 0:30:21.450 
P3:  
Do we? Yeah. 

0:30:21.750 --> 0:30:22.110 
Moderator: 
Alright. 

0:30:21.460 --> 0:30:24.360 
P3:  
So I was curious after this interview to find out. 

0:30:28.470 --> 0:30:28.790 
P3:  
OK. 

0:30:24.900 --> 0:30:32.830 
Moderator: 
I have a meeting in half, half an hour with that person I will make sure that the official channels and that that information comes back to you. 

0:30:32.960 --> 0:30:39.310 
Moderator: 
So, since we are interested in the other tool too, at the end of that, we would like to do another interview like this. 

0:30:39.860 --> 0:30:40.120 
P3:  
OK. 

0:30:39.320 --> 0:30:42.170 
Moderator: 
So we can definitely get that comparison of. 

0:30:42.240 --> 0:30:46.60 
Moderator: 
Maybe that process went better, or maybe it was worse to hear that. 

0:30:45.780 --> 0:30:46.510 
P3:  
Right, right. 

0:30:48.300 --> 0:30:48.530 
Moderator: 
OK. 

0:30:48.250 --> 0:30:55.350 
P3:  
And is it going to be built the same way with just a few questions in there for the same questions or? 

0:30:56.50 --> 0:30:57.40 
Moderator: 
It is. 

0:30:57.90 --> 0:31:0.460 
Moderator: 
Umm, you're flipping to be a gelled of pot. 

0:31:0.470 --> 0:31:1.350 
Moderator: 
It will be 6. 

0:31:2.470 --> 0:31:3.0 
P3:  
Ohh OK. 

0:31:3.270 --> 0:31:4.550 
Moderator: 
Six different ones. 

0:31:5.310 --> 0:31:20.900 
P3:  
So then I feel like already I would say that ones going to be more helpful just because there's more questions being asked more of a time saver on the other end for those that do complete it, because the LPN wouldn't have to ask so many questions in the room. 

0:31:24.610 --> 0:31:24.770 
Moderator: 
OK. 

0:31:22.670 --> 0:31:25.870 
P3:  
So that'll be interesting. 

0:31:25.980 --> 0:31:28.110 
P3:  
Yeah, you know. 

0:31:32.220 --> 0:31:32.680 
P3:  
OK. 

0:31:26.630 --> 0:31:32.910 
Moderator: 
Yeah, but I will make sure that somebody reaches out and shares more meeting. 

0:31:32.690 --> 0:31:35.600 
P3:  
And I will upload that letter for you guys so you can see it. 

0:31:36.340 --> 0:31:38.250 
Moderator: 
Thank you so much and enjoy the rest of your day. 

0:31:37.800 --> 0:31:39.850 
P3:  
Alright, alright, thank you. 

0:31:39.860 --> 0:31:40.60 
P3:  
Bye bye. 

0:31:40.280 --> 0:31:40.590 
Moderator: 
Bye.
