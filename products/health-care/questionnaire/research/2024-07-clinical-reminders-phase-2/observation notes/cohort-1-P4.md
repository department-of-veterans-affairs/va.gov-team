Intro - 5 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is Jenny/Nina [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes. I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. Are you okay with them joining this session?

Okay, great. I’ll let them know. I’ll have them turn on their cameras and introduce themselves to you and then they’ll turn their cameras back off for the remainder of the session. Let’s start with X.

In this session, we are looking for your feedback on your experience with receiving and answering VA healthcare questionnaires.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, so I won't be offended by any opinions you express.

Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to.

Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in anyway with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.

I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?

If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.

If yes: Admit observers.

Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)

Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth.

(If applicable) You'll be interacting with a prototype today. This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not.

Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.

Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.

Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
Yes
Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences?

One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image.

Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products.

These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not, but we like to ask ahead of time. At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.

Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?

If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.

Start recording.

I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? Yes

Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?

Moderator: Questions asked are based on the participant’s cohort.
a. Cohort 1-Participants from Phase 1 start at Warm-up questions
b. Cohort 2-Newly recruited participants start at Continuation of warm-up question
Warm-up questions for Cohort 1 only - 5 minutes
Before we start looking at the prototype, do you recall some of the pre-appointment questions my colleague asked you back in January during your last session with us?
Moderator: If participant does not recall any Phase 1 questions, move to question 2. If participant recalls the questions, then ask:
No I don’t. 
1a. Do you recall what was your experience going through those questions? 
1b. Do you recall if the experience was positive or negative? Why?
1c. Do you recall anything in particular about those questionnaires that stood out to you?
We are going to go through a similar process again, but this time I’ll only show revised questions from the toxic exposure questions reminder. These revisions are based on the feedback we received from the usability sessions you participated in back in January. But before we move on to the prototype, I have a few more questions.
Moderator: move to Continuation of warm-up questions…
Continuation of warm-up questions for Cohort 1 and 2 – 10 minutes
Since your enrollment in VA healthcare, do you recall ever receiving notifications from the VA asking you to fill out healthcare related questionnaires that were not related to a specific healthcare appointment?
Moderator: If participant answers no, move to question 2.

If participant answers yes, then ask the following questions:

1a. How did you receive this notification, was it through a text messaging, or email?
1b. Do you recall if you were ever hesitant, or you ever felt uneasy to click on the VA notification, or its content due to it potentially being spam, or not from the VA? Why or why not?
1c. What would you add, delete, or change about the notification, or the link, to make you feel more confident the notification was from the VA?
1d. Did any of these notifications include a link to a healthcare related questionnaire?

1f. What was the length of time it took you to respond to the actual questionnaire(s)?
1g. Do you think that is it took a reasonable amount of time to complete it, just the right amount of time, or an unreasonable amount of time?
1h. How do you feel about answering healthcare related questionnaires-do you feel that they are worth your time to fill out, not worth your time, or you have neutral feelings about filling them out? Why or why not?
1i. What did you expect to happen after you filled out the questionnaire(s).Do you recall about how many times between healthcare appointments, or within a 6-month period, you received similar questionnaire(s)?
1j. Do you recall the cadence as being infrequent, just the right amount of time, or too frequent?-What cadence do you consider to be reasonable amount of time?
1k. How do you feel about receiving a skin cancer screening questionnaire even if you don’t have any upcoming healthcare appointments in the near future?
1l. Would you prefer to answer this type of questionnaire online or in-person at the time of your healthcare appointment? Why?
1m. Suppose the VA sent you a batch of 3-6 healthcare related questionnaires all at once?
1n. How would you like to receive the batch, via email or text notification?
How many questionnaires in a batch would you consider to be a reasonable amount to respond to at once?
1p. What cadence would you expect to receive a batch of 3-6 questionnaires and why?
Moderator: move to Task 1.

Imagine a scenario where you are enrolled in VA healthcare, and you intermittently receive notifications from the VA asking you to fill out healthcare related questionnaires that aren’t directly related to any healthcare appointment:
2a. . How do you feel about receiving a skin cancer screening questionnaire even if you don’t have any upcoming healthcare appointments in the near future?
2b. Would you prefer to answer this type of questionnaire online or in-person at the time of your healthcare appointment.
2c. How would you like receive this notification, is it through a text messaging or email?
2d. What would make you hesitant, or uneasy to click on the VA notification, or its content due to it potentially being spam, or not from the VA?
2e. What would you add, delete, or change about the notification, or the link, to make you feel more confident the notification is from the VA?
2f. How long would the questionnaire have to be for you to consider it to be a reasonable amount of time to complete?
2g. How do you feel about answering healthcare related questionnaires-do you feel that they are worth your time to fill out, not worth your time, or you have neutral feelings about filling them out? Why or why not?
2h. What do you expect to happen after you fill out healthcare related questionnaire(s).
2i. What cadence in receiving a questionnaire do you consider to be just the right amount of time?
2j. Suppose the VA sent a batch of 3-6 healthcare related questionnaires all at once?
2k How would you like to receive the batch, via email or text notification?
2l. How many questionnaires in a batch would you consider to be:
2m. a reasonable amount to respond to at oncce?
2n. What cadence would you expect to receive a batch of 3-6 questionnaires and why?
Moderator: move to Task 1.
Task 1: Notifications - 5 minutes
Moderator: Share your screen with image of text or email notification; which modality you show participant depends on what device they are using during session.
Ok great, we will move on to an image of a notification. Would you please tell me what device you are using for this session-are you using a desktop/laptop, tablet, or a mobile phone?

I will be sharing my screen of an/or (email or text) that you may receive, please read it out loud and share your thoughts and overall impressions. Also, please think aloud as you review.

Notetaker: Note any observations about the following things: What do they comment on as confusing or valuable without prompting?

2a. Is there anything about the notification that is unclear?
2b. Would you add, delete, or change anything about the content within the notification?
2c. How much time do you estimate it will take you to complete this questionnaire?
If you received this notification via email (or text), would you trust that it was sent from the VA? Why or why not? I’m going, to be honest, probably not. I am very weary of links that get text to me because of phishing. I would go to my portal first to see if they are requesting information. Like, my VA benefits or my health portal. If it says they want me to fill out a form that is when I would feel comfortable.
3a. What would you add, delete, or change about the content to make you feel more confident that this notification came from the VA? If the VA had established text messaging with me I would be more comfortable. Of like if they sent it multiple times then I would know it’s the VA because they get annoying when they want you to do something. 
What about the message it’s self? I don’t know what BHL means. 
On a scale from 1 to 5 (with 1 being very easy and 5 being very difficult), how easy or difficult is it to read or understand this notification?
I would say a 1.
Moderator: move to Task 2.
Task 2: Prototype Welcome screen-5 minutes
Okay, great. Now I’m going to send you the prototype link in the Zoom chat. If you would please click on the link and share your screen.- But please, don’t click on anything on the questionnaire page until I give you further instructions.
Moderator: Send participant BHL link via chat.
Okay, I sent you the link in the Zoom chat, did you receive it?
Moderator: Assist user with finding the chat, clicking on link, and sharing their screen.
Next, pretend that you are answering health questionnaires that the VA has sent you. We also call these clinical reminders, so you may hear me refer to them as such. These questions may or may not be familiar to you.

Please read the questions out loud and share your overall impressions of the entire content on each page. I would expect this like, for an appointment or like you know when you sit down at the doctors with a clip board, but in electronic form.

As you’re moving through the questionnaire, please wait to click on anything, or before moving on to the next screen until I ask you to do so. -Also, just a reminder, this is a prototype, so we will not be offended by your candid feedback.

Is there anything on this page that is unclear?
It’s very clear, It’s clear it’s a screening.
Would you add, delete, or change any of the content in anyway?

Please move on.

Moderator: move to Task 3.
Task 3: Screen 1-Toxic exposure screening intro- 3 minutes
Without clicking on anything, please read out loud and share your overall impressions as you move through the entire page. 
So, I’m guessing this is just like a general screening for your doctor. So it’s not connected to disability compensation, it has nothing to do with that whole process. They are trying to catch people who may have been exposed to this. Because of the PACT Act they are now granting more benefits because of their toxic exposure. 
Notetaker: Note if the Veteran’s understanding coincides, or not, with what the content is trying to convey.
What does screening mean to you here? 
It means they are trying to get a feel bout how their patients are doing. You can talk to them and catch anything they might be feeling. It’s not testing but prepping. 
What does the Veteran comment on as confusing or valuable without prompting?
Which questionnaire branching logic does the Veteran follow? Note if the clinical reminders end in a positive or negative result. Write down any comments shared without prompting from the moderator.
Is there anything on here that is unclear.
No nothing is unclear.
Is it clear or unclear as to why the VA is asking you toxic exposure questions and Why?

In the second paragraph, the sentence, ‘This screening is optional, what do you think of the content?

Without clicking on anything, in the question Do you want to continue with this toxic exposure screening, can you to tell me what the word “screening’ means to you?

5a. Is there anything about the question that is unclear.
You can go ahead and scroll down to the section that says “Note:The PACT Act law...”.

6a. Can you tell me what this content means to you?
They were taken to court because they need to create a better way to identify veterans that were exposed to those toxins. This is saying they expanded VA health care for that to identify those problems and you can receive benefits for that exposure. 
Can you tell me your thoughts about the “View Privacy Act Statement”?
It’s always good to have disclaimers and the actual statement. It is probably just talking about what they can and cannot share based on your answers to this survey. I think it is pretty standard. 
On a scale from 1 to 5 (with 1 being very easy and 5 being very difficult), how easy or difficult was it to answer these questions?
A 1
Okay you may answer the question and please move on from this page.

Moderator: move to Task 4.
Task 4: Screen 2-Exposure to toxins or hazards while serving - 3 minutes
Again, please read out loud and share your overall impressions.

Is there anything on here that is unclear?

What is your impression of the toxic exposure examples given in this list?
3a. Are there enough options for you to answer this question accurately, or do you believe there are not enough? Why or why not? I think so. 
3b. Do you feel that this question relates to you and your time of service, or not? Why or why not? I don’t think so. I think there wasn’t anything during my service related to these toxins. I would think other stuff like cleaning agents that we used in the motor pool. 
Moderator: If the Veteran feels that the question does not relate to them or their time of service:

3c. What would you add, delete, or change about this question to make it more relatable to you and your time of service? Cleaning agents, and stuff in the motor pool like gas and things of that nature. 
3d. Without clicking on anything, how would you answer this question? Probably would have said no, because everything I said seems like an exposure but I don’t think they were asking about those. Things like Agent orange is more serious, but cleaning agents can still be bad. There is no indication that they are looking for minor exposure. Maybe they should put job related exposure. This seems pretty straightforward they are looking for these exposures. 
Moderator: If participant answers I am not sure, ask the following:

3e. Why did you choose I am not sure? I just be answering the question. If we didn’t have a conversation that is what I would have chosen. 
Changed to yes after talking to facilitator. 
3f. Is there anything in the question that made you feel unsure? If so, what?
3g. What information would you like to see to make your more confident to select either a Yes or a No?
On a scale from 1 to 5 (with 1 being very easy and 5 being very difficult), how easy or difficult was it to answer these questions about?

Go ahead and answer the question and please move on.

Moderator: Note what answer participant selects on this screen, since the answer will determine whether user goes to either screen 3a or screen 4a.
If yes, go to task 5 “Which toxins or hazards were you exposed to”
If no, go to task 8, “Thank you” page and the end of questionnaire.
If I’m not sure, go to task 7, “Do you want more information”
Task 5: Screen 3a-Which toxins or hazards were you exposed to - 3 minutes
You may begin reading please.

Is there anything on here that is unclear?`
I think everything is clear. I would change my answer, because I haven’t been exposed to these so if I click other and it doesn't expand on these I would go back and say no. 
What about the first paragraph, anything confusing or unclear?

What is your impression of this question and the list of options that you’re given?
I think the answers are un-useful but not the question. 
4a. Do you feel that the question relates to your time of service, or not? Why or why not?
Moderator: If the Veteran feels that the question does not relate to their time of service ask:

4b. What would you add, delete, or change about this question to make it more relatable to you?
4c. Are the options you are given in this question adequate for you to answer this accurately, or not? Why or why not?
Moderator: If the Veteran feels that question does not provide enough options to answer accurately, then ask:

4d. What would you add, delete, or change about this question so that you answer it accurately?
On a scale from 1 to 5 (with 1 being very easy and 5 being very difficult), how easy or difficult was it to answer these questions? I think a 2. 

Is there anything else that you would add, delete or change on this page?
I don’t think it’s the question, I think it’s the answers that are available. I would like when I click other  a box pop up for me to put in my answer. I don’t think I am going to get information about my exposure. 
Go ahead and answer the question.

Moderator: If the Veteran selects “other exposures” then they will be directed to Task 6 screen 3b-“Please describe the other exposures”.
This is what I was expecting. 
Moderator: If the Veteran selects any of the 5 “exposures”, then they will be directed to the next screen, Task 7, screen 4a-“Do you want more information about any of these topics”.

Task 6: Screen 3b- -Please describe the other exposures – 1 minute
What do you think of this page?
The box is small and doesn’t even allow a sentence.
What would you add, delete, or change about this question?

Go ahead and answer the question and please move on.

Task 7: Screen 4a-Do you want more information- 7 minutes
You may begin reading please.
It seems straight forward.
Is there anything on here that is unclear? If so, why?
Nothing is unclear.
Without clicking on anything, what do you think about the first question “Do you want more information about any of these topics?

3a. Is there anything unclear? Nothing’s unclear
3b. Do you think this question is useful or not useful within this context? Why or why not?
Yeah I think it’s a helpful question. The answers are geared towards possible effects and what the VA can offer. 
3c. What do expect to happen after answering this question? It said you will send a text or email. So a follow up. 
3d. What do you anticipate will happen if you select any of the options?
Please scroll down to the “What to know about VA environmental health registry exams section”. 
4a. Is there anything unclear? No this is good. 
4b. Is it clear, or not, on what a health registry is after reading this paragraph?
4c. Would add, delete, or change any of the content in anyway? Why or why not? No
4d. Is it clear to you why a registry exam is different from a claim exam? Yes because these are just related to your service. From my understanding registry exams are for someone who might have been exposed so they are offering a free chance to find out at no cost to you. 
On a scale from 1 to 5 (with 1 being very easy and 5 being very difficult), how easy or difficult is it to answer these questions?

Okay, please go ahead and make your selection and move on.

Moderator: move to Task 8.
Task 8: Screen 4b or 4c Thank you page- 3 minutes
8 sub-task 4b

Moderator: If the Veteran selects,” I don’t have any questions at this time, then they will be directed to screen 4b-Thank you for completing this screener…,” then ask the following:

a. Is there anything unclear? No
b. How soon after you submit this questionnaire do you expect to receive a text or email with toxic exposure information and resources? Probably within 24 hours or the next week. 
c. What do you expect to find in the information and resources? Everything that was listed before, where to get the exam, the process of registering for the exam. Different types of exposure more information about toxins in general. 
d. What else would you like to receive after completing this questionnaire?
e. What do expect to happen next as a result of completing this questionnaire? I would get more information or they are going to alert someone that I need an exam and following up to make sure I am not exposed. 
f. Do you expect this questionnaire to affect your future healthcare in anyway, yes or no? Why or why not? Yes. I think it would probably be put in my chart if I was exposed and add it to the list of things that are affecting me. I would also be able to file another claim related to this exposure. 
g. Do you expect your provider to mention this questionnaire during your next encounter? Why or why not?
h. Are you satisfied or unsatisfied with the information on this page? Why or why not? Satisified
i. Would add, delete, or change any of the content in anyway?
j. On a scale from 1 to 5 (with 1 being very easy and 5 being very difficult), how easy or is it to understand this page? ONE
8 sub-task 4c

Moderator: If the Veteran selects “additional information”, then they will be directed to the next screen 4c- “Thank you for completing this screener…” page, then ask the following:
a. Is there anything unclear?
b. How soon after you submit this questionnaire do you expect to receive a text or email with toxic exposure information and resources?
c. What do you expect to find in the information and resources?
d. What else would you like to receive after completing this questionnaire?
e. What do expect to happen next as a result of completing this questionnaire?
f. Do you expect this questionnaire to affect to affect your future healthcare in anyway, yes or no? Why or why not?
g. Are you satisfied or unsatisfied with the information on this page? Why or why not?
h. Would add, delete, or change any of the content in anyway?
i. On a scale from 1 to 5 (with 1 being very easy and 5 being very difficult), how easy or is it to understand this page?
Task 9- Frequency, cadence, and questionnaire limits per batch
1. Now that you’ve gone through a toxic exposure questionnaire, you have a good idea of what a health questionnaire or clinical reminder may be like. Please keep in mind that the VA has a vast amount of health questionnaires on a wide range of mental and physical health concerns. Which questionnaire you will receive will depend on VA’s health initiative directives, your service history, and your current health status.
2. So next, I’ll ask you hypothetical questions on receiving with type of questionnaire in the future from the VA. Imagine a scenario where you are enrolled in VA healthcare, and you intermittently receive notifications from the VA asking you to fill out healthcare related questionnaires that aren’t directly related to any healthcare appointment: They are not priority. If I don’t have an upcoming appointment, I don’t see a need to do this screening unless I have an upcoming appointment that we could further talk about it. 
If you had a choice, how you would like to receive a link for a similar questionnaire in the future? (ask them about modality, email, text Both message or email, the more notification he better.
How do you feel about answering healthcare related questionnaires-do you feel that they are worth your time to fill out, not worth your time, or you have neutral feelings about filling them out? Why or why not? I think they are valuable. 
Would you say this questionnaire took a reasonable or an unreasonable amount of time to complete? Why? 5 minutes or less
How do you feel about receiving a skin cancer screening
questionnaire, or any other health screening questionnaire, even if you don’t
have any upcoming healthcare appointments in the near future?
Would you prefer to answer this type of questionnaire online or in-person at the time of your healthcare appointment. ). No online or in person preference just before the appointment.
How would you like receive this notification, is it through a text messaging or email?
How long would the questionnaire have to be for you to consider it to be a reasonable amount of time to complete?
How do you feel about answering healthcare related questionnaires-do you feel that they are worth your time to fill out, not worth your time, or you have neutral feelings about filling them out? Why or why not?
What cadence in receiving a questionnaire do you consider to be just the right amount of time?
Suppose the VA sent a batch of 3-6 similar questionnaires all at once?
How many questionnaires in a batch would you consider to be a reasonable amount to respond to at once?
How would you like to receive the batch, via email or text notification?
What cadence would you expect to receive a batch of 3-6 questionnaires and why? (weekly, monthly, bi-monthly, etc..)
After completing this questionnaire, did it change your trust in the VA in anyway? No
Can you explain why you chose _____? I don’t expect them to do anything. It’s going to take a long time, it’s just another thing to do and wait around for. You can answer this questionnaire and not get an appointment for several months. 
How can the VA increase your trust with this questionnaire?
