• Review VA Platform's Research Checklist.

• Complete any project-specific setup tasks for this study (List them below) Day of the session

• Use #feedback-backchannel in Slack for real-time feedback from observers.

• Mute your Slack notifications.

• Send out the observer instructions to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into #feedback-backchannel).

Starting the session
• In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute.

• In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked

• Check your [screensharing setup] and share permissions for participants.

• When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*

Intro - 5 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is Jenny/Nina [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes. I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. Are you okay with them joining this session?

Okay, great. I’ll let them know. I’ll have them turn on their cameras and introduce themselves to you and then they’ll turn their cameras back off for the remainder of the session. Let’s start with X.

In this session, we are looking for your feedback on your experience with receiving and answering VA healthcare questionnaires.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, so I won't be offended by any opinions you express.

Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to.

Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in anyway with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.

I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?

If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.

If yes: Admit observers.

Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)

Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth.

(If applicable) You'll be interacting with a prototype today. This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not.

Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.

Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.

Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
Sure
Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences?

One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image.

Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products.

These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not, but we like to ask ahead of time. At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.

Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?

If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.

Start recording.

I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? Yes.

Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?

Moderator: Questions asked are based on the participant’s cohort.
a. Cohort 1-Participants from Phase 1 start at Warm-up questions
b. Cohort 2-Newly recruited participants start at Continuation of warm-up question
Warm-up questions for Cohort 1 only - 5 minutes
Before we start looking at the prototype, do you recall some of the pre-appointment questions my colleague asked you back in January during your last session with us?
Moderator: If participant does not recall any Phase 1 questions, move to question 2. If participant recalls the questions, then ask:

1a. Do you recall what was your experience going through those questions?
1b. Do you recall if the experience was positive or negative? Why?
1c. Do you recall anything in particular about those questionnaires that stood out to you?
We are going to go through a similar process again, but this time I’ll only show revised questions from the toxic exposure questions reminder. These revisions are based on the feedback we received from the usability sessions you participated in back in January.
Moderator: move to Task 1.
Task 1: Notifications - 5 minutes
Moderator: Share your screen with image of text or email notification; which modality you show participant depends on what device they are using during session.
Ok great, we will move on to an image of a notification. Would you please tell me what device you are using for this session-are you using a desktop/laptop, tablet, or a mobile phone? Apple desktop, Macintosh.

I will be sharing my screen of an/or (email or text) that you may receive, please read it out loud and share your thoughts and overall impressions. Also, please think aloud as you review.

Notetaker: Note any observations about the following things: What do they comment on as confusing or valuable without prompting?
What’s your overall impression of this notification? It seems to me like a generic notification. 
2a. Is there anything about the notification that is unclear? 
2b. Would you add, delete, or change anything about the content within the notification? Yeah, I probably would. Normally, you can hover over it and see if it is a real URL. I would hover over the email address at the top I don’t know about that email address; that might make me suspicious and not want to click on it. 
2c. How much time do you estimate it will take you to complete this questionnaire?
If you received this notification via email (or text), would you trust that it was sent from the VA? Why or why not?
3a. What would you add, delete, or change about the content to make you feel more confident that this notification came from the VA? If I knew that this is something that the VA is doing, if I hadn’t heard they are doing this I probably wouldn’t click on this. 
What else would you add or change to make you feel like this is from the VA? I don’t know I am not sure there is anything else I would do.
On a scale from 1 to 5 (with 1 being very easy and 5 being very difficult), how easy or difficult is it to read or understand this notification? Well the first 2 sentences it’s pretty much a 1, it’s pretty easy. Having something at the end of this telling you how long it is going to take would be good. That way I know if it is good to start or wait until I have time. 
Is there anything else you would add or change? I would put the expires in 96 hours in bold. 
Moderator: move to Task 2.
Task 2: Prototype Welcome screen-5 minutes
Okay, great. Now I’m going to send you the prototype link in the Zoom chat. If you would please click on the link and share your screen.- But please, don’t click on anything on the questionnaire page until I give you further instructions.
Moderator: Send participant BHL link via chat.
Okay, I sent you the link in the Zoom chat, did you receive it?
Moderator: Assist user with finding the chat, clicking on link, and sharing their screen.
Next, pretend that you are answering health questionnaires that the VA has sent you. We also call these clinical reminders, so you may hear me refer to them as such. These questions may or may not be familiar to you.

Please read the questions out loud and share your overall impressions of the entire content on each page.

As you’re moving through the questionnaire, please wait to click on anything, or before moving on to the next screen until I ask you to do so. -Also, just a reminder, this is a prototype, so we will not be offended by your candid feedback.

Is there anything on this page that is unclear?

Would you add, delete, or change any of the content in anyway?

Please move on.

Moderator: move to Task 3.
Task 3: Screen 1-Toxic exposure screening intro- 3 minutes
Without clicking on anything, please read out loud and share your overall impressions as you move through the entire page.
Notetaker: Note if the Veteran’s understanding coincides, or not, with what the content is trying to convey.
What does the Veteran comment on as confusing or valuable without prompting? No.
Which questionnaire branching logic does the Veteran follow? Note if the clinical reminders end in a positive or negative result. Write down any comments shared without prompting from the moderator.
Is there anything on here that is unclear.

Is it clear or unclear as to why the VA is asking you toxic exposure questions and Why?
Fairly clear, the screening is optional we will use your answers to connect you with information. 
In the second paragraph, the sentence, ‘This screening is optional, what do you think of the content?

Without clicking on anything, in the question Do you want to continue with this toxic exposure screening, can you to tell me what the word “screening’ means to you? I assume it is like burn pits, or asbestos e military service is exposed to all kind of things, I assum it is all of the above.
I assume it means it is asking me about my experience. 

5a. Is there anything about the question that is unclear.
You can go ahead and scroll down to the section that says “Note:The PACT Act law...”.
Would you add or change anything to the content in the note section, in other words is everything you need to know on this screen or do you need more information. Yeah if I didn’t know what it is  I would open a new tab and google it. 
6a. Can you tell me what this content means to you.
Can you tell me your thoughts about the “View Privacy Act Statement”?

On a scale from 1 to 5 (with 1 being very easy and 5 being very difficult), how easy or difficult was it to answer these questions?
How would you rate this page for understanding? 1-5?
I would put a 1. 
Okay you may answer the question and please move on from this page.

Moderator: move to Task 4.
Task 4: Screen 2-Exposure to toxins or hazards while serving - 3 minutes
Again, please read out loud and share your overall impressions.

Is there anything on here that is unclear?
I would think pit would be plural, but you know I was at Camp Lejeune but not during those years, I would put years next to camp Lejeune otherwise you would get a lot of false positives. 
What is your impression of the toxic exposure examples given in this list?

3a. Are there enough options for you to answer this question accurately, or do you believe there are not enough? Why or why not? You have a catch all at the end, other exposures so yeah that covers everything else. There is enough options there. 
3b. Do you feel that this question relates to you and your time of service, or not? Why or why not? Yes
Moderator: If the Veteran feels that the question does not relate to them or their time of service:

3c. What would you add, delete, or change about this question to make it more relatable to you and your time of service? Anything else you would add or change? No
3d. Without clicking on anything, how would you answer this question?
Moderator: If participant answers I am not sure, ask the following:

3e. Why did you choose I am not sure?
3f. Is there anything in the question that made you feel unsure? If so, what?
3g. What information would you like to see to make your more confident to select either a Yes or a No?
On a scale from 1 to 5 (with 1 being very easy and 5 being very difficult), how easy or difficult was it to answer these questions about?
As written, I would put a 2. Because of the dates not being clear for Camp Lejeune. Airborne hazards and open burn pit should be separated. I don’t remember seeing it listed like that before. 
Go ahead and answer the question and please move on.

Moderator: Note what answer participant selects on this screen, since the answer will determine whether user goes to either screen 3a or screen 4a.
If yes, go to task 5 “Which toxins or hazards were you exposed to”
If no, go to task 8, “Thank you” page and the end of questionnaire.
If I’m not sure, go to task 7, “Do you want more information”
Task 5: Screen 3a-Which toxins or hazards were you exposed to - 3 minutes
You may begin reading please.

Is there anything on here that is unclear?`

What about the first paragraph, anything confusing or unclear?

What is your impression of this question and the list of options that you’re given?
Again here with Camp Lejeune I would click on that if I didn’t know better. I think that that part is confusing. I think you need to put the years after Camp Lejeune.
4a. Do you feel that the question relates to your time of service, or not? Why or why not?
Moderator: If the Veteran feels that the question does not relate to their time of service ask:

4b. What would you add, delete, or change about this question to make it more relatable to you?
4c. Are the options you are given in this question adequate for you to answer this accurately, or not? Why or why not?
Moderator: If the Veteran feels that question does not provide enough options to answer accurately, then ask:

4d. What would you add, delete, or change about this question so that you answer it accurately?
On a scale from 1 to 5 (with 1 being very easy and 5 being very difficult), how easy or difficult was it to answer these questions?

Is there anything else that you would add, delete or change on this page?

Go ahead and answer the question.

Moderator: If the Veteran selects “other exposures” then they will be directed to Task 6 screen 3b-“Please describe the other exposures”.

Moderator: If the Veteran selects any of the 5 “exposures”, then they will be directed to the next screen, Task 7, screen 4a-“Do you want more information about any of these topics”.

Task 6: Screen 3b- -Please describe the other exposures – 1 minute
What do you think of this page?

What would you add, delete, or change about this question?

Go ahead and answer the question and please move on.

Task 7: Screen 4a-Do you want more information- 7 minutes
You may begin reading please.

Is there anything on here that is unclear? If so, why?

Without clicking on anything, what do you think about the first question “Do you want more information about any of these topics?

3a. Is there anything unclear?
3b. Do you think this question is useful or not useful within this context? Why or why not?
3c. What do expect to happen after answering this question?
3d. What do you anticipate will happen if you select any of the options?
Please scroll down to the “What to know about VA environmental health registry exams section”.
Can you tell me what registry exams means to you?
Well it would have something to do with toxic exposure issues. 
How would you find out what registry of exams are? I would go to VA. Gov
After prompting noted the Registry Exam Drop down. 
How would you make it stick out more. A hyper link or bigger font. 
4a. Is there anything unclear?
4b. Is it clear, or not, on what a health registry is after reading this paragraph?
4c. Would add, delete, or change any of the content in anyway? Why or why not? I wouldn’t use “isn’t I would use is not”. 
4d. Is it clear to you why a registry exam is different from a claim exam?
On a scale from 1 to 5 (with 1 being very easy and 5 being very difficult), how easy or difficult is it to answer this page? It’s pretty easy, I’ll go with a 2.

Okay, please go ahead and make your selection and move on.

Moderator: move to Task 8.
Task 8: Screen 4b or 4c Thank you page- 3 minutes
8 sub-task 4b

Moderator: If the Veteran selects,” I don’t have any questions at this time, then they will be directed to screen 4b-Thank you for completing this screener…,” then ask the following:

a. Is there anything unclear? No
b. How soon after you submit this questionnaire do you expect to receive a text or email with toxic exposure information and resources? I would think within a couple of days.
What’s the best way you would like to receive this information? Email.
c. What do you expect to find in the information and resources?
d. What else would you like to receive after completing this questionnaire?
e. What do expect to happen next as a result of completing this questionnaire?
f. Do you expect this questionnaire to affect your future healthcare in anyway, yes or no? Why or why not?

8 sub-task 4c
Sent to a screen that said your answers were not sent to your provider.
How does that make you feel? It makes me feel like all my work was for nothing. I would try resending and hope it goes through, if nothing else I think it would make me start over. 
Okay go ahead and do what you would do if I wasn’t here. I would click retry, which I did but it’s not doing anything. 
Moderator: If the Veteran selects “additional information”, then they will be directed to the next screen 4c- “Thank you for completing this screener…” page, then ask the following:

i. On a scale from 1 to 5 (with 1 being very easy and 5 being very difficult), how easy or is it to understand this page?
Task 9: Frequency, cadence, and questionnaire limits per batch
Now that you’ve gone through a toxic exposure questionnaire, you have a good idea of what a health questionnaire or clinical reminder may be like. Please keep in mind that the VA has a vast amount of health questionnaires on a wide range of mental and physical health concerns. Which questionnaire you will receive will depend on VA’s health initiative directives, your service history, and your current health status.

So next, I’ll ask you hypothetical questions on receiving with type of questionnaire in the future from the VA. Imagine a scenario where you are enrolled in VA healthcare, and you intermittently receive notifications from the VA asking you to fill out healthcare related questionnaires that aren’t directly related to any healthcare appointment:

If you had a choice, how you would like to receive a link for a similar questionnaire in the future? (ask them about modality, email, text,) 

How do you feel about answering healthcare related questionnaires-do you feel that they are worth your time to fill out, not worth your time, or you have neutral feelings about filling them out? Why or why not?
It’s probably worth my time. What do you mean probably? If the link works. I want to help out, I want to maximize my benefits, but I also want to help. 
Would you say this questionnaire took a reasonable or an unreasonable amount of time to complete? Why? Well because I was reading it out lout and we were discussing it I say an unreasonable amount of time, but if I had done it on my own it would have been reasonable.

How do you feel about receiving a skin cancer screening questionnaire, or any other health screening questionnaire, even if you don’t have any upcoming healthcare appointments in the near future?

Would you prefer to answer this type of questionnaire online or in-person at the time of your healthcare appointment. I have no preference, though I would be less skeptical if I was at the provider.

How would you like to receive this notification, is it through a text messaging or email?

How long would the questionnaire have to be for you to consider it to be a reasonable amount of time to complete?

How do you feel about answering healthcare related questionnaires-do you feel that they are worth your time to fill out, not worth your time, or you have neutral feelings about filling them out? Why or why not?

What cadence in receiving a questionnaire do you consider to be just the right amount of time?

Suppose the VA sent a batch of 3-6 similar questionnaires all at once, how many questionnaires in a batch would you consider to be a reasonable amount to respond to at once?
How would you feel about receiving a batch of these at one time? Do they all have the time limit of 96 hours? Yeah. I would be okay with it.
Why did you mention the time limit? If it didn’t have a time limit, I might get distracted by life. But the time limit helps me to keep on track. 

How would you like to receive the batch, via email or text notification?
How long do you expect these would take?  If there was 9 of them I would say a couple of hours. 
Would you be okay with them taking a couple of hours? Yeah if I had 96 hours I wouldn’t mind. I do these things, my wife gets them and sends them to me. I like to help, I see the value. Like here I get $50 to do this.
What cadence would you expect to receive a batch of 3-6 questionnaires and why? (weekly, monthly, bi-monthly, etc…)? I’m retired so I don’t mind taking these once a week. If I wasn’t retired I probably wouldn’t do these. 
If I wasn’t retired I would say once a month. 
So do you have to see value. Yeah I like to see the value but it doesn't have to be a gift card or something, it can be just knowing I am helping and making a difference. 

After completing this questionnaire, did it change your trust in the VA in anyway?

Can you explain why you chose _____?

How can the VA increase your trust with this questionnaire?

Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes
Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies. Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

Emergency Exit
[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an emergency exit strategy. Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]

Additional link:
Participant is reading the screen out loud. Please retain this email so the resources can be accessed in the future. That doesn't make sense to me.
Can you please elaborate on what doesn’t make sense? (Rereads the section that doesn’t make sense) second time around that makes sense. 
On a scale of 1-5 how would you rate this notification as far as understanding? 
3-4 probably closer to 4. I just wasn’t expecting that.  And now I have to hold on to an email. 
3-4 which one are you leaning towards? If we hadn’t discussed it, I would say 4. Because we discussed it maybe a 2.
What would you change to make it clearer? Maybe the first paragraph. The second sentence I would reword “please visit the following link to view more information”. I don’t know what’s at the link, maybe I would explain that more. Why does it have to say based on my response. I can’t just get information. I guess it’s why I was confused it says based on your responses, I was expecting to see a summary of my responses. Again, why am I retaining my email, if I could just book mark the link. I hate it with the VA it takes so long to get anywhere. It is so redundant, and here it is again in a notification. 

3rd Link: Toxic Exposure Educational Materials:
This is the page you would get if you clicked on the link. What do you think? 
Umm, just so you know the one you showed earlier, it had 6 examples and this one only has 4 examples of exposure. 
Clicking on these links, is this what you expect to see?
It’s not what I expected, but I don’t know.
What would you like to receive and how would you like to see it? This is fine.
So it does meet your expectations or not? Yeah. Yeah I guess the only other thing I would add is, here it says here’s a form… I would like to see the link to a form so I don’t have to go find it. 
At the end of the highlighted sentence “you should file a claim for disability compensation”, it would be helpful to have a link there for me to file the claim.
