## Intro - 5 minutes
1.	Thanks for joining us today! My name is Jenny/Nina [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes. I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. Are you okay with them joining this session?
   
2.	Okay, great. I’ll let them know. I’ll have them turn on their cameras and introduce themselves to you and then they’ll turn their cameras back off for the remainder of the session. Let’s start with X.

3.	In this session, we are looking for your feedback on your experience with receiving and answering VA healthcare questionnaires.

4.	Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:
   
5.	This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
   
6.	In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, so I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
    
7.	Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to.
    
8.	Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in anyway with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
    
9.	I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?
	
    - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.

    - If yes: Admit observers.

    - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)

    - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth.

    - (If applicable) You'll be interacting with a prototype today. This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not.

    - Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.

    - Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. You bet. 

    - After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.

    - Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

    - Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences? 

    - One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image. 

    - Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. 

    - These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not, but we like to ask ahead of time. At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.

    - Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?

    - If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.

    - Start recording.

    - I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? Yes.

    - Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?

- Moderator: Questions asked are based on the participant’s cohort. 
    - a.	Cohort 1-Participants from Phase 1 start at Warm-up questions
    - b.	Cohort 2-Newly recruited participants start at Continuation of warm-up question

## Warm-up questions for Cohort 1 only - 5 minutes 
1.	Before we start looking at the prototype, do you recall some of the pre-appointment questions my colleague asked you back in January during your last session with us? 

- Moderator: If participant does not recall any Phase 1 questions, move to question 2.
If participant recalls the questions, then ask:

    - 1a. Do you recall what was your experience going through those questions?
    - 1b. Do you recall if the experience was positive or negative? Why?
    - 1c. Do you recall anything in particular about those questionnaires that stood out to you?

2.	We are going to go through a similar process again, but this time I’ll only show revised questions from the toxic exposure questions reminder. These revisions are based on the feedback we received from the usability sessions you participated in back in January.

- Moderator: move to Task 1.


## Task 1: Notifications - 5 minutes
- Moderator: Share your screen with image of text or email notification; which modality you show participant depends on what device they are using during session.
  
1. Ok great, we will move on to an image of a notification. Would you please tell me what device you are using for this session-are you using a desktop/laptop, tablet, or a mobile phone?
   
2. I will be sharing my screen of an/or (email or text) that you may receive, please read it out loud and share your thoughts and overall impressions. Also, please think aloud as you review.
   Tell me your thoughts about this email? Is there a way of putting who your provider is? The health care team I have no idea who the health care team is. I see my provider and a few other specialists. My provider can see what they are doing, and I assume they are able to see what my provider is doing. I don’t know if they are the team.
I am not very experienced with this stuff. I can’t even get on my healthy vet. 
The person writing this assumes the reader knows what they are talking about. They use acronyms and abbreviations that someone may not know. 
- Notetaker: Note any observations about the following things: What do they comment on as confusing or valuable without prompting? 

    - 2a. Is there anything about the notification that is unclear?
    - 2b. Would you add, delete, or change anything about the content within the notification?
    - 2c. How much time do you estimate it will take you to complete this questionnaire?
  
3. If you received this notification via email (or text), would you trust that it was sent from the VA? Why or why not? Yes, I know there is a lot of phishing but if it says VA I trust it. I have no idea what BHL is but it says VA.gov and that is what I trust. 
- 3a. What would you add, delete, or change about the content to make you feel more confident 	that this notification came from the VA?
  
4. On a scale from 1 to 5 (with 1 being very easy and 5 being very difficult), how easy or difficult is it to read or understand this notification? It is relatively easy, I would say a 1 but I would want to know which provider they are talking about. 

- Moderator: move to Task 2.

## Task 2: Prototype Welcome screen-5 minutes

1. Okay, great. Now I’m going to send you the prototype link in the Zoom chat. If you would please click on the link and share your screen.- But please, don’t click on anything on the questionnaire  page until I give you further instructions.
   
- Moderator: Send participant BHL link via chat.

2. Okay, I sent you the link in the Zoom chat, did you receive it?

- Moderator: Assist user with finding the chat, clicking on link, and sharing their screen.

3. Next, pretend that you are answering health questionnaires that the VA has sent you. We also call these clinical reminders, so you may hear me refer to them as such. These questions may or may not be familiar to you.
   
4. Please read the questions out loud and share your overall impressions of the entire content on each page.
   
5. As you’re moving through the questionnaire, please wait to click on anything, or before moving on to the next screen until I ask you to do so. -Also, just a reminder, this is a prototype, so we will not be offended by your candid feedback.
   
6. Is there anything on this page that is unclear?
   I would assume that this is just how I am doing. If the provider is sending it for any specific reason that should be in there. If it is just, how are you doing it should be like hay it’s been so long since we have seen you and we have a meeting in so many days is there anything we need to talk about. 
7. Would you add, delete, or change any of the content in anyway?
  
8. Please move on.
    
- Moderator: move to Task 3.

## Task 3: Screen 1-Toxic exposure screening intro- 3 minutes
1. Without clicking on anything, please read out loud and share your overall impressions as you move through the entire page. If this is what’s going to come up this is great. I say this because I was exposed to agent orange multiple times during my time, as well as other chemicals, and that area is now called a brown field. 
- Notetaker: Note if the Veteran’s understanding coincides, or not, with what the content is trying to convey.
    - What does the Veteran comment on as confusing or valuable without prompting?
    - Which questionnaire branching logic does the Veteran follow? Note if the clinical reminders end in a positive or negative result. Write down any comments shared without prompting from the moderator.
      
2. Is there anything on here that is unclear. I would want to be able to list where I was at and a list of what chemicals were stored there. 
   
3. Is it clear or unclear as to why the VA is asking you toxic exposure questions and Why?
   What does toxic exposure screening meant to you? It want’s to know what I have been around.
What does screening mean to you here? 
It just wants to know if I want to continue, I assume it is going to get into toxins I have been exposed to. 
4. In the second paragraph, the sentence, ‘This screening is optional, what do you think of the content?
   
5. Without clicking on anything, in the question Do you want to continue with this toxic exposure screening, can you to tell me what the word “screening’ means to you?
    - 5a. Is there anything about the question that is unclear.
      
6. You can go ahead and scroll down to the section that says “Note:The PACT Act law...”.
    - 6a. Can you tell me what this content means to you.
7. Can you tell me your thoughts about the “View Privacy Act Statement”?
8.  On a scale from 1 to 5 (with 1 being very easy and 5 being very difficult), how easy or difficult was it to answer these questions? I would have one question, why is it that veterans who are not enrolled and who meet eligibility requirements… I would say it is easy to understand once you think about it. 
I would say it is about a 2 or a 3. 
Are you referring to the whole screen or just the note section? Just the note section. 
How would you rate the whole screen? I would say a 1. 
9. Okay you may answer the question and please move on from this page.

- Moderator: move to Task 4.

## Task 4: Screen 2-Exposure to toxins or hazards while serving - 3 minutes
1. Again, please read out loud and share your overall impressions.
   
2. Is there anything on here that is unclear?
   There’s one thing that is not there that we experienced but it would fall under other, so that is a collect all that was not addressed. 
3. What is your impression of the toxic exposure examples given in this list?
    - 3a. Are there enough options for you to answer this question accurately, or do you believe 	there are not enough? Why or why not? I am going to assume that when it comes to next, yeah I would click yes. 
    - 3b. Do you feel that this question relates to you and your time of service, or not? Why or why 	not? Yes

- Moderator: If the Veteran feels that the question does not relate to them or their time of service: 

    - 3c. What would you add, delete, or change about this question to make it more relatable to you and your time of 
  service? 
    - 3d. Without clicking on anything, how would you answer this question?
- Moderator: If participant answers I am not sure, ask the following:
    - 3e. Why did you choose I am not sure?
    - 3f. Is there anything in the question that made you feel unsure? If so, what?
    - 3g. What information would you like to see to make your more confident to select either a Yes or a No?
      
4. On a scale from 1 to 5 (with 1 being very easy and 5 being very difficult), how easy or difficult was it to answer these questions about?
   I would say 1.   
5. Go ahead and answer the question and please move on.

- Moderator: Note what answer participant selects on this screen, since the answer will determine whether user goes to either screen 3a or screen 4a.
    - If yes, go to task 5 “Which toxins or hazards were you exposed to”
    - If no, go to task 8, “Thank you” page and the end of questionnaire.
    - If I’m not sure, go to task 7, “Do you want more information”


## Task 5: Screen 3a-Which toxins or hazards were you exposed to - 3 minutes
1. You may begin reading please.
   
2. Is there anything on here that is unclear?`

3. What about the first paragraph, anything confusing or unclear?

4. What is your impression of this question and the list of options that you’re given?
    - 4a. Do you feel that the question relates to your time of service, or not? Why or why not?

- Moderator: If the Veteran feels that the question does not relate to their time of service ask:
  
    - 4b. What would you add, delete, or change about this question to make it more relatable to you?
    - 4c. Are the options you are given in this question adequate for you to answer this accurately, or not? Why or why not? Yes because the other exposures.
- Moderator: If the Veteran feels that question does not provide enough options to answer 	accurately, then ask:
    - 4d. What would you add, delete, or change about this question so that you answer it accurately?
      
5. On a scale from 1 to 5 (with 1 being very easy and 5 being very difficult), how easy or difficult was it to answer these questions? Are you only allowed 5 minutes for these sections? You are asking me to go back over 50 years. 
You have as much time as you need. So, we need to clarify that. Anything else you would like to know? I have a hard time believing that there are only 5 toxins. 
So, are you saying these questions are not inclusive of different veteran’s experience? Yes, you have different services and different exposures. 
   
6. Is there anything else that you would add, delete or change on this page?
   
7. Go ahead and answer the question.
    
- Moderator: If the Veteran selects “other exposures” then they will be directed to Task 6 screen 3b-“Please describe the other exposures”.

- Moderator: If the Veteran selects any of the 5 “exposures”, then they will be directed to the next screen, Task 7,  screen 4a-“Do you want more information about any of these topics”. 

## Task 6: Screen 3b- -Please describe the other exposures – 1 minute
1. What do you think of this page?
   I would put in burning of the Honey Pots, and pest control. Oh, see it made me think of other things. 
2. What would you add, delete, or change about this question?
   
3. Go ahead and answer the question and please move on.
   It doesn’t give you enough room to put everything in.
Is this adequate, is this what you were expecting when you clicked other exposure?
I would be really upset if I wasn’t able to list everything.
Other than that what else would you like to see on this screen?
I can’t think of anything else.
Scale of 1-5?
The way it is, it’s difficult because you can’t put all the information in there. I would say it’s a 4.
## Task 7: Screen 4a-Do you want more information- 7 minutes
1. You may begin reading please.
Oh this is good okay!
I doubt anyone would click I don’t have any questions. I think everyone would have questions about toxic exposure. I think what is missing is do you think any of those exposures have impacted your children. I have two children that have problems. I believe my kids conditions are a result of the agent orange. So I would say biological, because adopted children wouldn’t be affected. 
2. Is there anything on here that is unclear? If so, why?
One of the problems with toxins is the mental effect. I have a friend that is in a Alzheimer’s home, and I wouldn’t be surprised if that was the cause. Even I am starting to have problems with my memory.
Do you feel the “How toxic exposures may affect my health” is not adequate enough? No I think it should say “my health and mental well being”.
How about “how toxic exposure affects my physical and mental health”? Yeah that sounds good. 
3. Without clicking on anything, what do you think about the first question “Do you want more information about any of these topics?
    - 3a. Is there anything unclear?
    - 3b. Do you think this question is useful or not useful within this context? Why or why not?
    - 3c. What do expect to happen after answering this question?
    - 3d. What do you anticipate will happen if you select any of the options?

4.  Please scroll down to the “What to know about VA environmental health registry exams section”.
    - 4a. Is there anything unclear?
    - 4b. Is it clear, or not, on what a health registry is after reading this paragraph?
    - 4c. Would add, delete, or change any of the content in anyway? Why or why not?
    - 4d. Is it clear to you why a registry exam is different from a claim exam?

5. On a scale from 1 to 5 (with 1 being very easy and 5 being very difficult), how easy or difficult is it to answer these questions?

6. Okay, please go ahead and make your selection and move on.  

- Moderator: move to Task 8.

## Task 8: Screen 4b or 4c Thank you page- 3 minutes

**8 sub-task 4b**
- Moderator: If the Veteran selects,” I don’t have any questions at this time, then they will be directed to screen 4b-Thank you for completing this screener…,” then ask the following:

    - a. Is there anything unclear?
    - b. How soon after you submit this questionnaire do you expect to receive a text or email with toxic exposure information and resources?
    - c.	What do you expect to find in the information and resources?
    - d.	What else would you like to receive after completing this questionnaire?
    - e.	What do expect to happen next as a result of completing this questionnaire?
    - f.	Do you expect this questionnaire to affect your future healthcare in anyway, yes or no? Why or why not? 
    - g.	Do you expect your provider to mention this questionnaire during your next encounter? Why or why not?
    - h.	Are you satisfied or unsatisfied with the information on this page? Why or why not?
    - i.	Would add, delete, or change any of the content in anyway?
    - j.	On a scale from 1 to 5 (with 1 being very easy and 5 being very difficult), how easy or is it to understand this page?

**8 sub-task 4c**
- Moderator: If the Veteran selects “additional information”, then they will be directed to the next screen 4c- “Thank you for completing this screener…” page, then ask the following:
    - a. Is there anything unclear?
    - b. How soon after you submit this questionnaire do you expect to receive a text or email with toxic exposure information and resources?
    - c. What do you expect to find in the information and resources?
    - d. What else would you like to receive after completing this questionnaire?
    - e. What do expect to happen next as a result of completing this questionnaire?
    - f. Do you expect this questionnaire to affect to affect your future healthcare in anyway, yes or no? Why or why not?
    - g. Are you satisfied or unsatisfied with the information on this page? Why or why not?
    - h. Would add, delete, or change any of the content in anyway?
    - i. On a scale from 1 to 5 (with 1 being very easy and 5 being very difficult), how easy or is it to understand this page?


## Task 9: Frequency, cadence, and questionnaire limits per batch 

1. Now that you’ve gone through a toxic exposure questionnaire, you have a good idea of what a health questionnaire or clinical reminder may be like. Please keep in mind that the VA has a vast amount of health questionnaires on a wide range of mental and physical health concerns. Which questionnaire you will receive will depend on VA’s health initiative directives, your service history, and your current health status.  

2. So next, I’ll ask you hypothetical questions on receiving with type of questionnaire in the future from the VA. Imagine a scenario where you are enrolled in VA healthcare, and you intermittently receive notifications from the VA asking you to fill out healthcare related questionnaires that aren’t directly related to any healthcare appointment:   

 

   - If you had a choice, how you would like to receive a link for a similar questionnaire in the future? (ask them about modality, email, text,) 

   - How do you feel about answering healthcare related questionnaires-do you feel that they are worth your time to fill out, not worth your time, or you have neutral feelings about filling them out? Why or why not? 

   - Would you say this questionnaire took a reasonable or an unreasonable amount of time to complete? Why? 

   - How do you feel about receiving a skin cancer screening questionnaire, or any other health screening questionnaire, even if you don’t have any upcoming healthcare appointments in the near future? 

   - Would you prefer to answer this type of questionnaire online or in-person at the time of your healthcare appointment. 

   - How would you like receive this notification, is it through a text messaging or email? 

   - How long would the questionnaire have to be for you to consider it to be a reasonable amount of time to complete? 

   - How do you feel about answering healthcare related questionnaires-do you feel that they are worth your time to fill out, not worth your time, or you have neutral feelings about filling them out? Why or why not? 

   - What cadence in receiving a questionnaire do you consider to be just the right amount of time?  

   - Suppose the VA sent a batch of 3-6 similar questionnaires all at once, how many questionnaires in a batch would you consider to be a reasonable amount to respond to at once? 

   - How would you like to receive the batch, via email or text notification? 

   - What cadence would you expect to receive a batch of 3-6 questionnaires and why? (weekly, monthly, bi-monthly, etc..) 

   - After completing this questionnaire, did it change your trust in the VA in anyway? 

   - Can you explain why you chose _____? 

   - How can the VA increase your trust with this questionnaire? 



## Task 10 Follow-up Email and Link 

- Moderator: Show Participant the Follow-email.


1. Please read and tell me your thoughts on this screen.

   
- Anything unclear, missing or you would add to this?


- what do you expect to happen after you click on the material resources link? 


2. Okay, so I sent you link for you to click on so you can view the material resources.


- Moderator: Send participant link of the Material resources link: https://bhl.va.gov/pe?288=BG


- Please read and tell me your thoughts on this screen.


- Go ahead and click on the links and tell me your thoughts about the information your given. 



## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes
Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.
Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit
[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an emergency exit strategy. Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
