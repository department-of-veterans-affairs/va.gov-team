• Mute your Slack notifications.

• Send out the observer instructions to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into #feedback-backchannel).

Starting the session
• In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute.

• In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked

• Check your [screensharing setup] and share permissions for participants.

• When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*

Intro - 5 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is Jenny/Nina [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes. I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. Are you okay with them joining this session?

Okay, great. I’ll let them know. I’ll have them turn on their cameras and introduce themselves to you and then they’ll turn their cameras back off for the remainder of the session. Let’s start with X.

In this session, we are looking for your feedback on your experience with receiving and answering VA healthcare questionnaires.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, so I won't be offended by any opinions you express.

Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to.

Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in anyway with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.

I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?

If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.

If yes: Admit observers.

Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)

Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth.

(If applicable) You'll be interacting with a prototype today. This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not.

Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.

Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.

Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences?

One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image.

Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products.

These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not, but we like to ask ahead of time. At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.

Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?

If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.

Start recording.

I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? I am yes. 6t

Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?

Moderator: Questions asked are based on the participant’s cohort.
a. Cohort 1-Participants from Phase 1 start at Warm-up questions
b. Cohort 2-Newly recruited participants start at Continuation of warm-up question
Warm-up questions for Cohort 1 only - 5 minutes
Before we start looking at the prototype, do you recall some of the pre-appointment questions my colleague asked you back in January during your last session with us? I do a little bit but not a ton. 
Moderator: If participant does not recall any Phase 1 questions, move to question 2. If participant recalls the questions, then ask:

1a. Do you recall what was your experience going through those questions?
1b. Do you recall if the experience was positive or negative? Why?
1c. Do you recall anything in particular about those questionnaires that stood out to you?
We are going to go through a similar process again, but this time I’ll only show revised questions from the toxic exposure questions reminder. These revisions are based on the feedback we received from the usability sessions you participated in back in January. But before we move on to the prototype, I have a few more questions.
Moderator: move to Task 1.
Task 1: Notifications - 5 minutes
Moderator: Share your screen with image of text or email notification; which modality you show participant depends on what device they are using during session.
Ok great, we will move on to an image of a notification. Would you please tell me what device you are using for this session-are you using a desktop/laptop, tablet, or a mobile phone? Laptop

I will be sharing my screen of an/or (email or text) that you may receive, please read it out loud and share your thoughts and overall impressions. Also, please think aloud as you review.

Notetaker: Note any observations about the following things: What do they comment on as confusing or valuable without prompting?
It seems really simple. It would make me want to click on the link. The link here is right up front, I feel like some of the other ones were hidden. 
2a. Is there anything about the notification that is unclear?
2b. Would you add, delete, or change anything about the content within the notification?
2c. How much time do you estimate it will take you to complete this questionnaire?
If you received this notification via email (or text), would you trust that it was sent from the VA? Why or why not? I would look at the address, if it was VA.gov I would but it if it was gmail.com I wouldn’t.
3a. What would you add, delete, or change about the content to make you feel more confident that this notification came from the VA? No I think it’s right on. 
On a scale from 1 to 5 (with 1 being very easy and 5 being very difficult), how easy or difficult is it to read or understand this notification? 1 like I said it’s easy with the link right at the top. 
Moderator: move to Task 2.
Task 2: Prototype Welcome screen-5 minutes
Okay, great. Now I’m going to send you the prototype link in the Zoom chat. If you would please click on the link and share your screen.- But please, don’t click on anything on the questionnaire page until I give you further instructions.
Moderator: Send participant BHL link via chat.
Okay, I sent you the link in the Zoom chat, did you receive it?
Moderator: Assist user with finding the chat, clicking on link, and sharing their screen.
Next, pretend that you are answering health questionnaires that the VA has sent you. We also call these clinical reminders, so you may hear me refer to them as such. These questions may or may not be familiar to you.

Please read the questions out loud and share your overall impressions of the entire content on each page.
Super simple I would just hit start.
I just want to point out the VA.gov thing is why I would trust it.
As you’re moving through the questionnaire, please wait to click on anything, or before moving on to the next screen until I ask you to do so. -Also, just a reminder, this is a prototype, so we will not be offended by your candid feedback.

Is there anything on this page that is unclear?
Not at all
Would you add, delete, or change any of the content in anyway?

Please move on.

Moderator: move to Task 3.
Task 3: Screen 1-Toxic exposure screening intro- 3 minutes
Without clicking on anything, please read out loud and share your overall impressions as you move through the entire page.
Notetaker: Note if the Veteran’s understanding coincides, or not, with what the content is trying to convey.
What does the Veteran comment on as confusing or valuable without prompting?
Which questionnaire branching logic does the Veteran follow? Note if the clinical reminders end in a positive or negative result. Write down any comments shared without prompting from the moderator.
Is there anything on here that is unclear.
No, it makes sense.
Is it clear or unclear as to why the VA is asking you toxic exposure questions and Why?
I think it is and one of the things they added that I think is helpful is where it says this won’t affect your VA eligibility. There are reported horror stories that people that did this and lost benefits. 
The PACT at part is good balance, having it below to further educate you is good. 
In the second paragraph, the sentence, ‘This screening is optional, what do you think of the content? What does the word screening mean to you? It’s basically a series of questions. 

Without clicking on anything, in the question Do you want to continue with this toxic exposure screening, can you tell me what the word “screening’ means to you?

5a. Is there anything about the question that is unclear.
You can go ahead and scroll down to the section that says “Note:The PACT Act law...”.
So it’s basically the burn pit registry that you can do and it basically allows the VA better information to what happened, that allows them to connect veterans with better resources. 
6a. Can you tell me what this content means to you. It’s basically the burn pit registry. It’s basically meant to connect veterans with resources they don’t know about.
Can you tell me your thoughts about the “View Privacy Act Statement”? I would put it above the respondent burden part. I think this is more important than that stuff. 
On a scale from 1 to 5 (with 1 being very easy and 5 being very difficult), how easy or difficult was it to answer these questions? 1 it’s like a yes or no question.
Okay you may answer the question and please move on from this page.

Moderator: move to Task 4.
Task 4: Screen 2-Exposure to toxins or hazards while serving - 3 minutes
Again, please read out loud and share your overall impressions.
Although I understand what Gulf related exposures are, I’m thinking giving other exposures. I think it an easy question but I’m thinking other people would opt. themselves out because they don’t know what other would be. 
Is there anything on here that is unclear?

What is your impression of the toxic exposure examples given in this list?
I think these are good, but other exposures what are the examples of that. 
3a. Are there enough options for you to answer this question accurately, or do you believe there are not enough? Why or why not?
3b. Do you feel that this question relates to you and your time of service, or not? Why or why not? It does, the airborne hazards and burn pits really apply. 
Moderator: If the Veteran feels that the question does not relate to them or their time of service:

3c. What would you add, delete, or change about this question to make it more relatable to you and your time of service?
3d. Without clicking on anything, how would you answer this question?
Moderator: If participant answers I am not sure, ask the following:

3e. Why did you choose I am not sure?
3f. Is there anything in the question that made you feel unsure? If so, what?
3g. What information would you like to see to make your more confident to select either a Yes or a No?
On a scale from 1 to 5 (with 1 being very easy and 5 being very difficult), how easy or difficult was it to answer these questions about? It, one. 

Go ahead and answer the question and please move on.

Moderator: Note what answer participant selects on this screen, since the answer will determine whether user goes to either screen 3a or screen 4a.
If yes, go to task 5 “Which toxins or hazards were you exposed to”
If no, go to task 8, “Thank you” page and the end of questionnaire.
If I’m not sure, go to task 7, “Do you want more information”
Task 5: Screen 3a-Which toxins or hazards were you exposed to - 3 minutes
You may begin reading please.

Is there anything on here that is unclear? Not really this is good it is giving you the option of other exposures. 

What about the first paragraph, anything confusing or unclear?
It almost just reiterates why you are doing it and to feel comfortable as to the why.
What is your impression of this question and the list of options that you’re given?

4a. Do you feel that the question relates to your time of service, or not? Why or why not?
Moderator: If the Veteran feels that the question does not relate to their time of service ask:

4b. What would you add, delete, or change about this question to make it more relatable to you?
4c. Are the options you are given in this question adequate for you to answer this accurately, or not? Why or why not?
Moderator: If the Veteran feels that question does not provide enough options to answer accurately, then ask:

4d. What would you add, delete, or change about this question so that you answer it accurately?
On a scale from 1 to 5 (with 1 being very easy and 5 being very difficult), how easy or difficult was it to answer these questions? 1 because it give you the other option, if it was just those 5 options it would be harder. 

Is there anything else that you would add, delete or change on this page?

Go ahead and answer the question.

Moderator: If the Veteran selects “other exposures” then they will be directed to Task 6 screen 3b-“Please describe the other exposures”.

Moderator: If the Veteran selects any of the 5 “exposures”, then they will be directed to the next screen, Task 7, screen 4a-“Do you want more information about any of these topics”.

Task 6: Screen 3b- -Please describe the other exposures – 1 minute
What do you think of this page?
I think it’s good it give you the opportunity to provide an answer that maybe the doctors can interpret for you. 
What would you add, delete, or change about this question?
Not at all
Go ahead and answer the question and please move on.
Oil refinery exhaust, bur pits
Task 7: Screen 4a-Do you want more information- 7 minutes
You may begin reading please.

Is there anything on here that is unclear? If so, why?

Without clicking on anything, what do you think about the first question “Do you want more information about any of these topics?

3a. Is there anything unclear?
3b. Do you think this question is useful or not useful within this context? Why or why not? I think it’s awesome, I think it’s really helpful. Although how to update my VA doesn’t seem like it fits with what we are talking about. 
3c. What do expect to happen after answering this question? That I’m going to get information about whatever I want to ask about. Not in this survey because it’s only suppose to take 5 minutes. 
3d. What do you anticipate will happen if you select any of the options?
Please scroll down to the “What to know about VA environmental health registry exams section”.
Why is this even here? That doesn’t make sense do you want more information about the following topics. I feel like this should be separate; maybe do you want a registry exam. This seems like it should be listed down here as a question.
4a. Is there anything unclear? Not the rest of the question makes sense. 
4b. Is it clear, or not, on what a health registry is after reading this paragraph?
4c. Would add, delete, or change any of the content in anyway? Why or why not?
4d. Is it clear to you why a registry exam is different from a claim exam?
On a scale from 1 to 5 (with 1 being very easy and 5 being very difficult), how easy or difficult is it to answer these questions? A 1. 

Okay, please go ahead and make your selection and move on.

Moderator: move to Task 8.
Task 8: Screen 4b or 4c Thank you page- 3 minutes
8 sub-task 4b

Moderator: If the Veteran selects,” I don’t have any questions at this time, then they will be directed to screen 4b-Thank you for completing this screener…,” then ask the following:
It seems like super simple wording. The pervious questions were not specific to toxic exposures so that should be different. It just seems like a lot of words not hitting what it is suppose to hit. 
a. Is there anything unclear?
b. How soon after you submit this questionnaire do you expect to receive a text or email with toxic exposure information and resources? I think it should be pretty instant. I am assuming there is an algorithm that can generate that. 
c. What do you expect to find in the information and resources
Do you see any value there? Zero I am going to hit next. 
d. What else would you like to receive after completing this questionnaire?
e. What do expect to happen next as a result of completing this questionnaire?
f. Do you expect this questionnaire to affect your future healthcare in anyway, yes or no? Why or why not? I do, it says it right here “at your next appointment your provider will talk to you.” I expect my doctor to say okay you filled this out tell me what your worried about what are you feeling?
g. Do you expect your provider to mention this questionnaire during your next encounter? Why or why not?
h. Are you satisfied or unsatisfied with the information on this page? Why or why not?
i. Would add, delete, or change any of the content in anyway? 
j. On a scale from 1 to 5 (with 1 being very easy and 5 being very difficult), how easy or is it to understand this page? 

Moderator: If the Veteran selects “additional information”, then they will be directed to the next screen 4c- “Thank you for completing this screener…” page, then ask the following:
a. Is there anything unclear?
b. How soon after you submit this questionnaire do you expect to receive a text or email with toxic exposure information and resources?
c. What do you expect to find in the information and resources?
d. What else would you like to receive after completing this questionnaire?  I expect to get information and when I go to my next an appointment my provider is going to talk about it.
Why is there and OK there? Why am I hitting okay?
e. What do expect to happen next as a result of completing this questionnaire?
f. Do you expect this questionnaire to affect to affect your future healthcare in anyway, yes or no? Why or why not?
g. Are you satisfied or unsatisfied with the information on this page? Why or why not?
h. Would add, delete, or change any of the content in anyway? Just what we talked about.
i. On a scale from 1 to 5 (with 1 being very easy and 5 being very difficult), how easy or is it to understand this page?
It’s a 1, it’s just a lot of words. 
After trying to hit next without hitting okay, and not being able to move forward: instead of okay how about I acknowledge. 
8 sub-task 4c

Task 9: Frequency, cadence, and questionnaire limits per batch
Now that you’ve gone through a toxic exposure questionnaire, you have a good idea of what a health questionnaire or clinical reminder may be like. Please keep in mind that the VA has a vast amount of health questionnaires on a wide range of mental and physical health concerns. Which questionnaire you will receive will depend on VA’s health initiative directives, your service history, and your current health status.

So next, I’ll ask you hypothetical questions on receiving with type of questionnaire in the future from the VA. Imagine a scenario where you are enrolled in VA healthcare, and you intermittently receive notifications from the VA asking you to fill out healthcare related questionnaires that aren’t directly related to any healthcare appointment:

If you had a choice, how you would like to receive a link for a similar questionnaire in the future? (ask them about modality, email, text,) I would choose email, because I don’t want to get blown up with text messages. 

How do you feel about answering healthcare related questionnaires-do you feel that they are worth your time to fill out, not worth your time, or you have neutral feelings about filling them out? Why or why not? It really depends on what it is and what impact I am going to see from it. Is it going to be data that will help me to receive better health care or not. If not it’s a waste of time. 
That’s what I think it would be dependent on how many I got, how often and the length of time also the topics. If you are hounding me with it every day or every week you get survey fatigue. Or if they say it takes 5 minutes but it takes 15 to 20 I’m just going to be like I’m never doing this again. 

Would you say this questionnaire took a reasonable or an unreasonable amount of time to complete? Why? Yeah.

How do you feel about receiving a skin cancer screening questionnaire, or any other health screening questionnaire, even if you don’t have any upcoming healthcare appointments in the near future? I think it would be good as long as there is something that is critical is there a feedback for the next time I go to my provider. Is there a feedback mechanism that would trigger the provider to then call me. If my response doesn’t receive a response then why am I taking it. If my answer suggests a problem. 

Would you prefer to answer this type of questionnaire online or in-person at the time of your healthcare appointment.

How would you like receive this notification, is it through a text messaging or email?
Email is better, I get so many texts in a day it would probably get lost. 
How long would the questionnaire have to be for you to consider it to be a reasonable amount of time to complete? I would say 5-8 minutes anything over 10 minutes I am probably not going to do. 

How do you feel about answering healthcare related questionnaires-do you feel that they are worth your time to fill out, not worth your time, or you have neutral feelings about filling them out? Why or why not? I would do it online. 

What cadence in receiving a questionnaire do you consider to be just the right amount of time? I would say 3-4 weeks, definitely not less than 2 weeks for sure. I’m talking about VA surveys in general. Once a month ish which is 12 times a year, which is pretty significant when you think of it as time that’s a 10-minute survey that’s 2 hours of your life if you do it once a month. I think that’s what people need to think about. Survey fatigue is a real thing because you are not the only person sending them. 

Suppose the VA sent a batch of 3-6 similar questionnaires all at once, how many questionnaires in a batch would you consider to be a reasonable amount to respond to at once? And they are all 5-10 minutes long. If you tell me it’s 3 I might do it but if you tell me it’s six I’m not doing it. 

How would you like to receive the batch, via email or text notification?
Email
What cadence would you expect to receive a batch of 3-6 questionnaires and why? (weekly, monthly, bi-monthly, etc..) It goes back to how much time per thing, once a month would be too much. Unless there is a really good reason, show the reason I would do it. In general I wouldn’t. You probably won’t get real answers because 10-15 minutes in people are just going to start hitting answers to get done.

After completing this questionnaire, did it change your trust in the VA in anyway?
Only if I get the feedback I ask for. So if it says the provider is going to follow up and I get information then I feel like the VA cares about me. If it takes time then you don’t care about me or my time. 
Can you explain why you chose _____?

How can the VA increase your trust with this questionnaire?

Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes
Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies. Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
