## Intro - 5 minutes
1.	Thanks for joining us today! My name is Jenny/Nina [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes. I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. Are you okay with them joining this session?
   
2.	Okay, great. I’ll let them know. I’ll have them turn on their cameras and introduce themselves to you and then they’ll turn their cameras back off for the remainder of the session. Let’s start with X.

3.	In this session, we are looking for your feedback on your experience with receiving and answering VA healthcare questionnaires.

4.	Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:
   
5.	This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
   
6.	In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, so I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
    
7.	Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to.
    
8.	Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in anyway with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
    
9.	I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?
	
    - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.

    - If yes: Admit observers.

    - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)

    - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth.

    - (If applicable) You'll be interacting with a prototype today. This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not.

    - Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.

    - Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

    - After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.

    - Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

    - Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences? 

    - One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image. 

    - Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. 

    - These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not, but we like to ask ahead of time. At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.

    - Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?

    - If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.

    - Start recording.

    - I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

    - Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?

- Moderator: Questions asked are based on the participant’s cohort. 
    - a.	Cohort 1-Participants from Phase 1 start at Warm-up questions
    - b.	Cohort 2-Newly recruited participants start at Continuation of warm-up question

## Warm-up questions for Cohort 1 only - 5 minutes 
1.	Before we start looking at the prototype, do you recall some of the pre-appointment questions my colleague asked you back in January during your last session with us? 

- Moderator: If participant does not recall any Phase 1 questions, move to question 2.
If participant recalls the questions, then ask:

    - 1a. Do you recall what was your experience going through those questions?
    - 1b. Do you recall if the experience was positive or negative? Why?
    - 1c. Do you recall anything in particular about those questionnaires that stood out to you?

2.	We are going to go through a similar process again, but this time I’ll only show revised questions from the toxic exposure questions reminder. These revisions are based on the feedback we received from the usability sessions you participated in back in January.

- Moderator: move to Task 1.


## Task 1: Notifications - 5 minutes
- Moderator: Share your screen with image of text or email notification; which modality you show participant depends on what device they are using during session.

## Task 9: Frequency, cadence, and questionnaire limits per batch 

1. Now that you’ve gone through a toxic exposure questionnaire, you have a good idea of what a health questionnaire or clinical reminder may be like. Please keep in mind that the VA has a vast amount of health questionnaires on a wide range of mental and physical health concerns. Which questionnaire you will receive will depend on VA’s health initiative directives, your service history, and your current health status.  

2. So next, I’ll ask you hypothetical questions on receiving with type of questionnaire in the future from the VA. Imagine a scenario where you are enrolled in VA healthcare, and you intermittently receive notifications from the VA asking you to fill out healthcare related questionnaires that aren’t directly related to any healthcare appointment:   

 

   - If you had a choice, how you would like to receive a link for a similar questionnaire in the future? (ask them about modality, email, text,) 

   - How do you feel about answering healthcare related questionnaires-do you feel that they are worth your time to fill out, not worth your time, or you have neutral feelings about filling them out? Why or why not? 

   - Would you say this questionnaire took a reasonable or an unreasonable amount of time to complete? Why? 

   - How do you feel about receiving a skin cancer screening questionnaire, or any other health screening questionnaire, even if you don’t have any upcoming healthcare appointments in the near future? 

   - Would you prefer to answer this type of questionnaire online or in-person at the time of your healthcare appointment. 

   - How would you like receive this notification, is it through a text messaging or email? 

   - How long would the questionnaire have to be for you to consider it to be a reasonable amount of time to complete? 

   - How do you feel about answering healthcare related questionnaires-do you feel that they are worth your time to fill out, not worth your time, or you have neutral feelings about filling them out? Why or why not? 

   - What cadence in receiving a questionnaire do you consider to be just the right amount of time?  

   - Suppose the VA sent a batch of 3-6 similar questionnaires all at once, how many questionnaires in a batch would you consider to be a reasonable amount to respond to at once? 

   - How would you like to receive the batch, via email or text notification? 

   - What cadence would you expect to receive a batch of 3-6 questionnaires and why? (weekly, monthly, bi-monthly, etc..) 

   - After completing this questionnaire, did it change your trust in the VA in anyway? 

   - Can you explain why you chose _____? 

   - How can the VA increase your trust with this questionnaire? 



## Task 10 Follow-up Email and Link 

- Moderator: Show Participant the Follow-email.


1. Please read and tell me your thoughts on this screen.

   
- Anything unclear, missing or you would add to this?


- what do you expect to happen after you click on the material resources link? 


2. Okay, so I sent you link for you to click on so you can view the material resources.


- Moderator: Send participant link of the Material resources link: https://bhl.va.gov/pe?288=BG


- Please read and tell me your thoughts on this screen.


- Go ahead and click on the links and tell me your thoughts about the information your given. 



## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes
Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.
Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit
[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an emergency exit strategy. Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
