•	When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*
## Intro - 5 minutes
1.	Thanks for joining us today! My name is Jenny/Nina [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes. I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. Are you okay with them joining this session?
   
2.	Okay, great. I’ll let them know. I’ll have them turn on their cameras and introduce themselves to you and then they’ll turn their cameras back off for the remainder of the session. Let’s start with X.
3.	In this session, we are looking for your feedback on your experience with receiving and answering VA healthcare questionnaires.
4.	Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:
   
5.	This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
   
6.	In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, so I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
    
7.	Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to.
    
8.	Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in anyway with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
    
9.	I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?
	
    - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
    - If yes: Admit observers.
    - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)
    - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth.
    - (If applicable) You'll be interacting with a prototype today. This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not.
    - Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.
    - Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.
 Yes
    - After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.
    - Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
    - Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences? 
    - One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image. 
    - Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. 
    - These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not, but we like to ask ahead of time. At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.
    - Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?
    - If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.
    - Start recording.
    - I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? Yes
    - Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?
- Moderator: Questions asked are based on the participant’s cohort. 
    - a.	Cohort 1-Participants from Phase 1 start at Warm-up questions
    - b.	Cohort 2-Newly recruited participants start at Continuation of warm-up question
## Warm-up questions for Cohort 1 only - 5 minutes 
1.	Before we start looking at the prototype, do you recall some of the pre-appointment questions my colleague asked you back in January during your last session with us? I remember some of them but not all of them. If you asked me the same questions it might jog my memory. 
- Moderator: If participant does not recall any Phase 1 questions, move to question 2.
If participant recalls the questions, then ask:
    - 1a. Do you recall what was your experience going through those questions? At first it made me feel a little uneasy because they were new, but as things went on, I got more comfortable answering the questions. But initially they were some tough questions. 
By tough question what do you mean by that? It wasn’t a good thing or a bad thing, but you know when you go to the VA you may not get asked those questions. 
    - 1b. Do you recall if the experience was positive or negative? Why? Definitely positive, from my understanding you used my feed back an others feed back to make things better for the VA so that is a good thing.
    - 1c. Do you recall anything in particular about those questionnaires that stood out to you? No, I can’t say I do. That was when we were in furlough so that was a weird period.
2.	We are going to go through a similar process again, but this time I’ll only show revised questions from the toxic exposure questions reminder. These revisions are based on the feedback we received from the usability sessions you participated in back in January. But before we move on to the prototype, I have a few more questions. 
- Moderator: move to Continuation of warm-up questions…
## Continuation of warm-up questions for Cohort 1 and 2 – 10 minutes
1.	Since your enrollment in VA healthcare, do you recall ever receiving notifications from the VA asking you to fill out healthcare related questionnaires that were not related to a specific healthcare appointment?
No, every time I’ve gotten asked to answer a survey question, it was because I either had an upcoming appointment or after I’ve had an appointment. So I guess that would be in line with, you know, what’s really going on. In other words, I don’t get asked to do a survey out of the blue. I don’t have a particular appointment out there or I haven’t had a recent appointment, that would just kind of send a red flag in my mind. I mean, like, why are they asking me this?
- Moderator: If participant answers no, move to question 2.
  
- If participant answers yes, then ask the following questions:
    - 1a. How did you receive this notification, was it through a text messaging, or email?
They usually come in the form of email.  What about text messaging? I believe so and if it was a text message it was short it was like a 5 questionnaire type thing. You know you would rate your experience. 
    - 1b. Do you recall if you were ever hesitant, or you ever felt uneasy to click on the VA notification, or its content due to it potentially being spam, or not from the VA? Why or why not? No, when I see those types of messages, whether it be email or text after reading, I can kind of tell it comes from the VA, where it is a reliable source vs. Spam, and I am comfortable clicking on it.
 So, are you more comfortable with email vs. text? Yes, I’d be more inclined to open an email vs. a text. 
Why is that? I get more information from email, like email address, a header things like that.
    - 1c. What would you add, delete, or change about the notification, or the link, to make you feel more confident the notification was from the VA? (text message) Maybe like the name of the doctors assistant. The doctor doesn’t have time to text me so maybe the assistant does, and being able to identify that it came from them would be good. Like maybe the work phone, and her number and name. 
    - 1d. Did any of these notifications include a link to a healthcare related questionnaire? Not that I recall, again it was more along the lines of rating my over all experience with my appointment.
Do you recall filling out these questionnaires? Yes, again it was simple, like rate your experience they were pretty short. 
    - 1e. Do you recall how many questionnaires a notification contained?
    - 1f.  What was the length of time it took you to respond to the actual questionnaire(s)? 
    - 1g. Do you think that is it took a reasonable amount of time to complete it, just the right amount of time, or an unreasonable amount of time? 5-10 minutes, more than 20 minutes would be too much. Something I can do on my lunch break would be good.
    - 1h. How do you feel about answering healthcare related questionnaires-do you feel that they are worth your time to fill out, not worth your time, or you have neutral feelings about filling them out? Why or why not? I do, for me personally a health-related questionnaire give the doctor more to go on. I may not know everything going on with me. If the questions are related to me it makes me feel like they care about what’s going on with me. 
    - 1i. What did you expect to happen after you filled out the questionnaire(s).Do you recall about how many times between healthcare appointments, or within a 6-month period, you received similar questionnaire(s)? I don’t recall, but I would like to see that information sent to my primary care and she can take a look at in and build my next appointment around those questions. 
    - 1j. Do you recall the cadence as being infrequent, just the right amount of time, or too frequent?-What cadence do you consider to be reasonable amount of time? Right amount of time. 
    - 1k. How do you feel about receiving a skin cancer screening questionnaire even if you don’t have any upcoming healthcare appointments in the near future?    I would think this doesn’t apply to me so I don’t think I need to do it. But after I read it I might decide to fill it out. 
    - 1l. Would you prefer to answer this type of questionnaire online or in-person at the time of your healthcare appointment? Why? I would prefer online because it’s a convince thing. I think of mobile device I don’t have to be tied to a computer. I don’t mind doing it at the appointment but I prefer online. 
    - 1m. Suppose the VA sent you a batch of 3-6 healthcare related questionnaires all at once?
    - 1n.	How would you like to receive the batch, via email or text notification? A combination of text and email and I will get to them when I have time. Usually the same day I don’t like having them out there to do. 
    - 10.	How many questionnaires in a batch would you consider to be a reasonable amount to respond to at once? I think between 1-3. They can get all the information they need in 1 survey but they need to get more information in another survey. Too many will make me question why they are asking all these questions.
    - 1p.	What cadence would you expect to receive a batch of 3-6 questionnaires and why? 
For me before every visit, I would expect to get at least one for each appointment. Preferably before so they can find out what’s going on before I go in. 
- Moderator: move to Task 1.
  
2. Imagine a scenario where you are enrolled in VA healthcare, and you intermittently receive notifications from the VA asking you to fill out healthcare related questionnaires that aren’t directly related to any healthcare appointment:  
    - 2a. . How do you feel about receiving a skin cancer screening questionnaire even if you don’t have any upcoming healthcare appointments in the near future?    
    - 2b. Would you prefer to answer this type of questionnaire online or in-person at the time of your healthcare appointment.
    - 2c. How would you like receive this notification, is it through a text messaging or email?
    - 2d. What would make you hesitant, or uneasy to click on the VA notification, or its content due to it potentially being spam, or not from the VA? 
    - 2e. What would you add, delete, or change about the notification, or the link, to make you feel more confident the notification is from the VA?
    - 2f. How long would the questionnaire have to be for you to consider it to be a reasonable amount of time to complete?
    - 2g. How do you feel about answering healthcare related questionnaires-do you feel that they are worth your time to fill out, not worth your time, or you have neutral feelings about filling them out? Why or why not?
    - 2h. What do you expect to happen after you fill out healthcare related questionnaire(s).
    - 2i. What cadence in receiving a questionnaire do you consider to be just the right amount of time?
    - 2j. Suppose the VA sent a batch of 3-6 healthcare related questionnaires all at once?
    - 2k	How would you like to receive the batch, via email or text notification?
    - 2l. How many questionnaires in a batch would you consider to be:
    - 2m. a reasonable amount to respond to at oncce?
    - 2n. What cadence would you expect to receive a batch of 3-6 questionnaires and why?
- Moderator: move to Task 1.
## Task 1: Notifications - 5 minutes
- Moderator: Share your screen with image of text or email notification; which modality you show participant depends on what device they are using during session.
  
1. Ok great, we will move on to an image of a notification. Would you please tell me what device you are using for this session-are you using a desktop/laptop, tablet, or a mobile phone?
   Mobile
2. I will be sharing my screen of an/or (email or text) that you may receive, please read it out loud and share your thoughts and overall impressions. Also, please think aloud as you review.
   
- Notetaker: Note any observations about the following things: What do they comment on as confusing or valuable without prompting? 
    - 2a. Is there anything about the notification that is unclear?
    - 2b. Would you add, delete, or change anything about the content within the notification?
    - 2c. How much time do you estimate it will take you to complete this questionnaire?
  
3. If you received this notification via email (or text), would you trust that it was sent from the VA? Why or why not? Yes I would, I think only the VA would have a text message like that.
- 3a. What would you add, delete, or change about the content to make you feel more confident 	that this notification came from the VA? The VA.gov is a good indicator that it is from the VA. I would like to see an actual person’s name like my provider or someone from their office. I would be hesitant to click on the link, I probably wouldn’t click on that. 
Is there anything you would change or add or delete to make the link more trustworthy?
To make it more trustworthy instead of a link say please contact the VA and they would give you instructions on what to do. 
  
4. On a scale from 1 to 5 (with 1 being very easy and 5 being very difficult), how easy or difficult is it to read or understand this notification? Oh, it’s a 1.
- Moderator: move to Task 2.
## Task 2: Prototype Welcome screen-5 minutes
1. Okay, great. Now I’m going to send you the prototype link in the Zoom chat. If you would please click on the link and share your screen.- But please, don’t click on anything on the questionnaire  page until I give you further instructions.
   
- Moderator: Send participant BHL link via chat.
2. Okay, I sent you the link in the Zoom chat, did you receive it?
- Moderator: Assist user with finding the chat, clicking on link, and sharing their screen.
3. Next, pretend that you are answering health questionnaires that the VA has sent you. We also call these clinical reminders, so you may hear me refer to them as such. These questions may or may not be familiar to you.
   
4. Please read the questions out loud and share your overall impressions of the entire content on each page.
   
5. As you’re moving through the questionnaire, please wait to click on anything, or before moving on to the next screen until I ask you to do so. -Also, just a reminder, this is a prototype, so we will not be offended by your candid feedback.
   
6. Is there anything on this page that is unclear?
   Nope it’s pretty straightforward.
7. Would you add, delete, or change any of the content in anyway?
  No I would leave it the way it is.
8. Please move on.
    
- Moderator: move to Task 3.
## Task 3: Screen 1-Toxic exposure screening intro- 3 minutes
1. Without clicking on anything, please read out loud and share your overall impressions as you move through the entire page.
- Notetaker: Note if the Veteran’s understanding coincides, or not, with what the content is trying to convey.
    - What does the Veteran comment on as confusing or valuable without prompting?
    - Which questionnaire branching logic does the Veteran follow? Note if the clinical reminders end in a positive or negative result. Write down any comments shared without prompting from the moderator.
      
2. Is there anything on here that is unclear.
   No, well I guess the PACT law a lot of people aren’t familiar with that because the VA uses a lot of acronyms, so I would like more information about that.
3. Is it clear or unclear as to why the VA is asking you toxic exposure questions and Why?
 It’s not really clear I would like for it to be a lot more clear. I would like to assume they want to know if I have been exposed to toxins, but again that is me making an assumption. 
4. In the second paragraph, the sentence, ‘This screening is optional, what do you think of the content? I think it’s good this screening is optional so if I don’t want to take this survey I don’t have to. For me I want to know if I have been exposed. 
   
5. Without clicking on anything, in the question Do you want to continue with this toxic exposure screening, can you to tell me what the word “screening’ means to you?
    - 5a. Is there anything about the question that is unclear.
      
6. You can go ahead and scroll down to the section that says “Note:The PACT Act law...”.
    - 6a. Can you tell me what this content means to you.
      
7. Can you tell me your thoughts about the “View Privacy Act Statement”? I think its’s just saying they aren’t going to share your information and do everything they can to keep your information private.
8.  On a scale from 1 to 5 (with 1 being very easy and 5 being very difficult), how easy or difficult was it to answer these questions? I give it a 2.
9. Okay you may answer the question and please move on from this page.
- Moderator: move to Task 4.
## Task 4: Screen 2-Exposure to toxins or hazards while serving - 3 minutes
1. Again, please read out loud and share your overall impressions.
   
2. Is there anything on here that is unclear?
   No that is all pretty direct and straightforward.
3. What is your impression of the toxic exposure examples given in this list? I think it’s very good and very informative. Some of us have been out 16-17 years and they are jogging my memory. 
    - 3a. Are there enough options for you to answer this question accurately, or do you believe 	there are not enough? Why or why not? Although there are more toxins than this I think they are covered under these categories,.
    - 3b. Do you feel that this question relates to you and your time of service, or not? Why or why 	not? Yes I was around burn pits, airborne hazards and I am sure when I was in the war I was exposed things too. 
- Moderator: If the Veteran feels that the question does not relate to them or their time of service: 
    - 3c. What would you add, delete, or change about this question to make it more relatable to you and your time of 
  service? 
    - 3d. Without clicking on anything, how would you answer this question?
      Yes
- Moderator: If participant answers I am not sure, ask the following:
    - 3e. Why did you choose I am not sure?
    - 3f. Is there anything in the question that made you feel unsure? If so, what?
    - 3g. What information would you like to see to make your more confident to select either a Yes or a No?
      
4. On a scale from 1 to 5 (with 1 being very easy and 5 being very difficult), how easy or difficult was it to answer these questions about?
   A 1. 
5. Go ahead and answer the question and please move on.
- Moderator: Note what answer participant selects on this screen, since the answer will determine whether user goes to either screen 3a or screen 4a.
    - If yes, go to task 5 “Which toxins or hazards were you exposed to”
    - If no, go to task 8, “Thank you” page and the end of questionnaire.
    - If I’m not sure, go to task 7, “Do you want more information”
## Task 5: Screen 3a-Which toxins or hazards were you exposed to - 3 minutes
1. You may begin reading please.
2. Is there anything on here that is unclear? Nope it’s again self explanatory, pretty direct. 
3. What about the first paragraph, anything confusing or unclear? A little I thought it was the end of the survey. I don’t think that needs to be there. 
4. What is your impression of this question and the list of options that you’re given?
    - 4a. Do you feel that the question relates to your time of service, or not? Why or why not? Yes I do, although a short list it is very detailed and I think that the toxins should fall under one of these categories. 
- Moderator: If the Veteran feels that the question does not relate to their time of service ask:
  
    - 4b. What would you add, delete, or change about this question to make it more relatable to you?
    - 4c. Are the options you are given in this question adequate for you to answer this accurately, or not? Why or why not?
- Moderator: If the Veteran feels that question does not provide enough options to answer 	accurately, then ask:
    - 4d. What would you add, delete, or change about this question so that you answer it accurately?
      
5. On a scale from 1 to 5 (with 1 being very easy and 5 being very difficult), how easy or difficult was it to answer these questions? A 1.

   
6. Is there anything else that you would add, delete or change on this page?
   
7. Go ahead and answer the question.
    
- Moderator: If the Veteran selects “other exposures” then they will be directed to Task 6 screen 3b-“Please describe the other exposures”.
- Moderator: If the Veteran selects any of the 5 “exposures”, then they will be directed to the next screen, Task 7,  screen 4a-“Do you want more information about any of these topics”. 
## Task 6: Screen 3b- -Please describe the other exposures – 1 minute
1. What do you think of this page?
   
2. What would you add, delete, or change about this question?
   
3. Go ahead and answer the question and please move on.
   
## Task 7: Screen 4a-Do you want more information- 7 minutes
1. You may begin reading please.
2. Is there anything on here that is unclear? If so, why? No, I think it’s a great follow-up question to the previous question.
3. Without clicking on anything, what do you think about the first question “Do you want more information about any of these topics?
    - 3a. Is there anything unclear?
    - 3b. Do you think this question is useful or not useful within this context? Why or why not?
    - 3c. What do expect to happen after answering this question? Just like it says I expect to get a text or email outlining where I can go to get more information about these exposures. 
    - 3d. What do you anticipate will happen if you select any of the options?
4.  Please scroll down to the “What to know about VA environmental health registry exams section”. 
    - 4a. Is there anything unclear? I didn’t know how it would relate to these particular answers.
    - 4b. Is it clear, or not, on what a health registry is after reading this paragraph? It’s clear. I would have never known what it was without clicking the dropdown. 
    - 4c. Would add, delete, or change any of the content in anyway? Why or why not?
    - 4d. Is it clear to you why a registry exam is different from a claim exam? Yeah a claim exam is when you are looking for compensation, and a registry exam is just getting information. 
5. On a scale from 1 to 5 (with 1 being very easy and 5 being very difficult), how easy or difficult is it to answer these questions? A 1 also.
6. Okay, please go ahead and make your selection and move on.  
- Moderator: move to Task 8.
## Task 8: Screen 4b or 4c Thank you page- 3 minutes
**8 sub-task 4b**
- Moderator: If the Veteran selects,” I don’t have any questions at this time, then they will be directed to screen 4b-Thank you for completing this screener…,” then ask the following:
    - a. Is there anything unclear?
    - b. How soon after you submit this questionnaire do you expect to receive a text or email with toxic exposure information and resources?
    - c.	What do you expect to find in the information and resources?
    - d.	What else would you like to receive after completing this questionnaire?
    - e.	What do expect to happen next as a result of completing this questionnaire?
    - f.	Do you expect this questionnaire to affect your future healthcare in anyway, yes or no? Why or why not? 
    - g.	Do you expect your provider to mention this questionnaire during your next encounter? Why or why not?
    - h.	Are you satisfied or unsatisfied with the information on this page? Why or why not?
    - i.	Would add, delete, or change any of the content in anyway?
    - j.	On a scale from 1 to 5 (with 1 being very easy and 5 being very difficult), how easy or is it to understand this page?
**8 sub-task 4c**
- Moderator: If the Veteran selects “additional information”, then they will be directed to the next screen 4c- “Thank you for completing this screener…” page, then ask the following:
    - a. Is there anything unclear? Everything was clear.
    - b. How soon after you submit this questionnaire do you expect to receive a text or email with toxic exposure information and resources? For me I would say I would say 24 hours.
    - c. What do you expect to find in the information and resources? A list of the toxins, definitions of the toxins and steps you can take to file a claim, or just get a screening. You know a wealth of information surrounding the toxins I have been exposed to.
    - d. What else would you like to receive after completing this questionnaire? Maybe a phone call, but I would be okay if I had the information emailed to me or a link sent to me where I can get that information. 
    - e. What do expect to happen next as a result of completing this questionnaire?
    - f. Do you expect this questionnaire to affect to affect your future healthcare in anyway, yes or no? Why or why not? I do but not in a negative way. I would expect the information I submitted in private, they could contact me or I can talk to them. I think it shouldn’t be a negative thing. 
    - g. Are you satisfied or unsatisfied with the information on this page? Why or why not? I am satisfied with it, it gives me  list of resources or I can ignore it. In my case I would use this information. 
    - h. Would add, delete, or change any of the content in anyway?
    - i. On a scale from 1 to 5 (with 1 being very easy and 5 being very difficult), how easy or is it to understand this page? This is definitely a 1. It’s great information like I said. 
## Task 9- Questionnaire burden and trust–1 minute
1.	Would you say this questionnaire took a reasonable or an unreasonable amount of time to complete and why? Yes it was a reasonable amount of time. It was nothing that I felt was too much or too long. 
2.	After completing this questionnaire, did it change your trust in the VA in anyway? For me it would make me trust in the VA even more. It gives me 3 options to be in contact with someone. That’s more then enough for me. 
- 2a. Can you explain why you chose _____?
- 2b. How can the VA increase your trust with this questionnaire?
## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes
