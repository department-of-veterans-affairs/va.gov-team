• Complete any project-specific setup tasks for this study (List them below) Day of the session

• Use #feedback-backchannel in Slack for real-time feedback from observers.

• Mute your Slack notifications.

• Send out the observer instructions to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into #feedback-backchannel).

Starting the session
• In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute.

• In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked

• Check your [screensharing setup] and share permissions for participants.

• When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*

Intro - 5 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is Jenny/Nina [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes. I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. Are you okay with them joining this session?

Okay, great. I’ll let them know. I’ll have them turn on their cameras and introduce themselves to you and then they’ll turn their cameras back off for the remainder of the session. Let’s start with X.

In this session, we are looking for your feedback on your experience with receiving and answering VA healthcare questionnaires.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, so I won't be offended by any opinions you express.

Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to.

Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in anyway with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.

I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?

If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.

If yes: Admit observers.

Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)

Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth.

(If applicable) You'll be interacting with a prototype today. This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not.

Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.

Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.
Yes
After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.

Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences?

One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image.

Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products.

These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not, but we like to ask ahead of time. At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.

Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?

If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.
Start recording.

I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? Yes

Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?

Moderator: Questions asked are based on the participant’s cohort.
a. Cohort 1-Participants from Phase 1 start at Warm-up questions
b. Cohort 2-Newly recruited participants start at Continuation of warm-up question
Warm-up questions for Cohort 1 only - 5 minutes
Before we start looking at the prototype, do you recall some of the pre-appointment questions my colleague asked you back in January during your last session with us?
Moderator: If participant does not recall any Phase 1 questions, move to question 2. If participant recalls the questions, then ask:

1a. Do you recall what was your experience going through those questions?
1b. Do you recall if the experience was positive or negative? Why?
1c. Do you recall anything in particular about those questionnaires that stood out to you?
We are going to go through a similar process again, but this time I’ll only show revised questions from the toxic exposure questions reminder. These revisions are based on the feedback we received from the usability sessions you participated in back in January.
Moderator: move to Task 1.
Task 1: Notifications - 5 minutes
Moderator: Share your screen with image of text or email notification; which modality you show participant depends on what device they are using during session.
Ok great, we will move on to an image of a notification. Would you please tell me what device you are using for this session-are you using a desktop/laptop, tablet, or a mobile phone? A MacBook

I will be sharing my screen of an/or (email or text) that you may receive, please read it out loud and share your thoughts and overall impressions. Also, please think aloud as you review.

Notetaker: Note any observations about the following things: What do they comment on as confusing or valuable without prompting?

2a. Is there anything about the notification that is unclear? No, I mean to me it seems pretty obvious just kind of a check-in. To see how I am doing, maybe something preventative, something that can be caught before going into the deep end. 
2b. Would you add, delete, or change anything about the content within the notification?
2c. How much time do you estimate it will take you to complete this questionnaire? I would hope for a few minutes, like maybe 5 minutes. If surveys are too long, I will close out of them. 
How long is too long for you? 15 minutes. 
If you received this notification via email (or text), would you trust that it was sent from the VA? Why or why not? Yes I would. I know IT people would probably be more cautious, but I would trust it. It looks similar VA things. 
Would you prefer email or text? 
I would prefer email because it looks like it is going to take a little more time. If it is something that is going to take a little longer, I prefer to use my MacBook. 
3a. What would you add, delete, or change about the content to make you feel more confident that this notification came from the VA?
On a scale from 1 to 5 (with 1 being very easy and 5 being very difficult), how easy or difficult is it to read or understand this notification?
Moderator: move to Task 2.
Task 2: Prototype Welcome screen-5 minutes
Okay, great. Now I’m going to send you the prototype link in the Zoom chat. If you would please click on the link and share your screen.- But please, don’t click on anything on the questionnaire page until I give you further instructions.
Moderator: Send participant BHL link via chat.
Okay, I sent you the link in the Zoom chat, did you receive it?
Moderator: Assist user with finding the chat, clicking on link, and sharing their screen.
Next, pretend that you are answering health questionnaires that the VA has sent you. We also call these clinical reminders, so you may hear me refer to them as such. These questions may or may not be familiar to you.

Please read the questions out loud and share your overall impressions of the entire content on each page.

As you’re moving through the questionnaire, please wait to click on anything, or before moving on to the next screen until I ask you to do so. -Also, just a reminder, this is a prototype, so we will not be offended by your candid feedback.

Is there anything on this page that is unclear?
No, to me this is I clearly clicked on to do the survey, so this is just preparing me for the questions to come. 
Would you add, delete, or change any of the content in anyway? No, not for me but for others I would add the Mental Health crisis contact information. 

Please move on.

Moderator: move to Task 3.
Task 3: Screen 1-Toxic exposure screening intro- 3 minutes
Without clicking on anything, please read out loud and share your overall impressions as you move through the entire page.
Notetaker: Note if the Veteran’s understanding coincides, or not, with what the content is trying to convey.
What does the Veteran comment on as confusing or valuable without prompting?
Which questionnaire branching logic does the Veteran follow? Note if the clinical reminders end in a positive or negative result. Write down any comments shared without prompting from the moderator.
Is there anything on here that is unclear.
No. I was glad to see this doesn’t effect my eligibility for other benefits. 
Is it clear or unclear as to why the VA is asking you toxic exposure questions and Why?

In the second paragraph, the sentence, ‘This screening is optional, what do you think of the content?

Without clicking on anything, in the question Do you want to continue with this toxic exposure screening, can you to tell me what the word “screening’ means to you?
It’s gong to be questioning, I expect after this it will be more specific questions. 
5a. Is there anything about the question that is unclear.
You can go ahead and scroll down to the section that says “Note:The PACT Act law...”.
Is there anything unclear or missing in this paragraph? 
I don’t think so, I don’t know a lot about this so I wouldn’t know what’s missing or not. 
6a. Can you tell me what this content means to you.
Can you tell me your thoughts about the “View Privacy Act Statement”?
How would you find out about your privacy? 
I don’t know. I guess it says view privacy act statement. I guess I could click on that. 
On a scale from 1 to 5 (with 1 being very easy and 5 being very difficult), how easy or difficult was it to answer these questions? I would say initially I was going to give it a 1 because it’s just a yes or no question, but then I hesitated because it is a yes or no question, but it also brings stuff up with the military. I don’t know if I want to go there or not. So, I give it a 2.
Can  you elaborate? Yes so in one respect I was around things like insulation and stuff like that, on the other side I could have been exposed to other things. So even though it is a yest or no question it brings up things maybe I don’t know about. 
How would you answer this question if you were on your own? I think I would still do yes. But it does bring up hesitation for things I have experienced, I can imagine that it brings up things for other veterans. I don’t know if everyone would want to revisit certain things. 

Okay you may answer the question and please move on from this page.

Moderator: move to Task 4.
Task 4: Screen 2-Exposure to toxins or hazards while serving - 3 minutes
Again, please read out loud and share your overall impressions.

Is there anything on here that is unclear? No, though it does make me feel like some of the stuff I could have been exposed to is not as bad as radiation and agent orange.

What is your impression of the toxic exposure examples given in this list? These are very harsh and extreme, which is fair because this means your life span is going to be shortened and disrupted due to any of these exposures.

3a. Are there enough options for you to answer this question accurately, or do you believe there are not enough? Why or why not?
3b. Do you feel that this question relates to you and your time of service, or not? Why or why not? For me it is very small, but my exposures are pretty different and not quite severe. More like asbestos exposure.
Moderator: If the Veteran feels that the question does not relate to them or their time of service:

3c. What would you add, delete, or change about this question to make it more relatable to you and your time of service? Having more options, this feels like the far end of toxins. In my view there may be some other things I was exposed to that weren’t quite as intense. I guess something less intense, I know it says other, but I would like to see some other things listed. With this list I would hesitate to say yes I was exposed. 
3d. Without clicking on anything, how would you answer this question?
Moderator: If participant answers I am not sure, ask the following:

3e. Why did you choose I am not sure?
3f. Is there anything in the question that made you feel unsure? If so, what?
3g. What information would you like to see to make your more confident to select either a Yes or a No?
On a scale from 1 to 5 (with 1 being very easy and 5 being very difficult), how easy or difficult was it to answer these questions about?

Go ahead and answer the question and please move on.

Moderator: Note what answer participant selects on this screen, since the answer will determine whether user goes to either screen 3a or screen 4a.
If yes, go to task 5 “Which toxins or hazards were you exposed to”
If no, go to task 8, “Thank you” page and the end of questionnaire.
If I’m not sure, go to task 7, “Do you want more information”
Task 5: Screen 3a-Which toxins or hazards were you exposed to - 3 minutes
You may begin reading please.

Is there anything on here that is unclear?`

What about the first paragraph, anything confusing or unclear?

What is your impression of this question and the list of options that you’re given?

4a. Do you feel that the question relates to your time of service, or not? Why or why not?
Moderator: If the Veteran feels that the question does not relate to their time of service ask:

4b. What would you add, delete, or change about this question to make it more relatable to you?
4c. Are the options you are given in this question adequate for you to answer this accurately, or not? Why or why not?
Moderator: If the Veteran feels that question does not provide enough options to answer accurately, then ask:

4d. What would you add, delete, or change about this question so that you answer it accurately?
On a scale from 1 to 5 (with 1 being very easy and 5 being very difficult), how easy or difficult was it to answer these questions?

Is there anything else that you would add, delete or change on this page?

Go ahead and answer the question.

Moderator: If the Veteran selects “other exposures” then they will be directed to Task 6 screen 3b-“Please describe the other exposures”.

Moderator: If the Veteran selects any of the 5 “exposures”, then they will be directed to the next screen, Task 7, screen 4a-“Do you want more information about any of these topics”.

Task 6: Screen 3b- -Please describe the other exposures – 1 minute
What do you think of this page?

What would you add, delete, or change about this question?

Go ahead and answer the question and please move on.

Task 7: Screen 4a-Do you want more information- 7 minutes
You may begin reading please.

Is there anything on here that is unclear? If so, why? No.
Anything you would add change or delete? No.
Without clicking on anything, what do you think about the first question “Do you want more information about any of these topics?

3a. Is there anything unclear?
3b. Do you think this question is useful or not useful within this context? Why or why not?
3c. What do expect to happen after answering this question? I guess someone would reach out to me and say hey do you want to talk about it? 
3d. What do you anticipate will happen if you select any of the options?
Please scroll down to the “What to know about VA environmental health registry exams section”.
What does registry exam mean to you? 
It would be someone that would schedule an exam that works for me and they would ask questions take samples to see if I have any health related issues.
What do you think would happen next?
I think this would close because I don’t have any questions. I think that someone would reach out to me to follow up. I would prefer a text. 
4a. Is there anything unclear?
4b. Is it clear, or not, on what a health registry is after reading this paragraph?
4c. Would add, delete, or change any of the content in anyway? Why or why not?
4d. Is it clear to you why a registry exam is different from a claim exam?
On a scale from 1 to 5 (with 1 being very easy and 5 being very difficult), how easy or difficult is it to answer these questions?
I feel that this page is a 1. So far, it’s given me, you know that other page gave me some hesitation. It was some loaded questions. This one feels like more of a relief. It talks about it too when it talks about the health registry exam. How it can help in the future or even right now if I am feeling something that could be related to this. This feels more safe.

Okay, please go ahead and make your selection and move on.

Moderator: move to Task 8.
Task 8: Screen 4b or 4c Thank you page- 3 minutes

Task 9: Frequency, cadence, and questionnaire limits per batch
Now that you’ve gone through a toxic exposure questionnaire, you have a good idea of what a health questionnaire or clinical reminder may be like. Please keep in mind that the VA has a vast amount of health questionnaires on a wide range of mental and physical health concerns. Which questionnaire you will receive will depend on VA’s health initiative directives, your service history, and your current health status.
Your answers were not sent to your provider:
What would you do if I wasn’t here? I would click the button and retry to send to your provider. 
I did click on it but it didn’t go anywhere. 
What are your thoughts on this page? It’s broken. I am glad it wasn’t 15 minutes for me to do all that and then it doesn’t send to my provider. 
Do you have any questions on the survey you just took? No, like I said I don’t feel like it applies to me. It gave me some pause and hesitation. It might be even bigger for people that were exposed to some of those things. 
So next, I’ll ask you hypothetical questions on receiving with type of questionnaire in the future from the VA. Imagine a scenario where you are enrolled in VA healthcare, and you intermittently receive notifications from the VA asking you to fill out healthcare related questionnaires that aren’t directly related to any healthcare appointment:

If you had a choice, how you would like to receive a link for a similar questionnaire in the future? (ask them about modality, email, text,) I get a bulk of my messaging through email from the VA. SO when I message my health care provider, I get VA news letters. I get most of my communication from the VA through email, so that is my preferred. 

How do you feel about answering healthcare related questionnaires-do you feel that they are worth your time to fill out, not worth your time, or you have neutral feelings about filling them out? Why or why not? I do think it is worth my time, I don’t feel like I get to see results. You fill out this information and then I never hear anything back. I do fill those things out because I like to help, and also if I have had issues maybe they will learn about them. 

Would you say this questionnaire took a reasonable or an unreasonable amount of time to complete? Why? I think it was reasonable, it was very short compared to other ones I have filled out. 

How do you feel about receiving a skin cancer screening questionnaire, or any other health screening questionnaire, even if you don’t have any upcoming healthcare appointments in the near future ?

Would you prefer to answer this type of questionnaire online or in-person at the time of your healthcare appointment. I don’t mind doing it from the comfort of my home, but if you are on site, you are usually waiting so there is time to fill it out there. There is two different mind sets between the comfort of my home and when I am at the clinic. At the clinic I might cater my answers so they know I am health, and I can get out the door. Our clinic is nice but there is good news and bad news. I think at home I would give a more open response.

How would you like receive this notification, is it through a text messaging or email?

How long would the questionnaire have to be for you to consider it to be a reasonable amount of time to complete?

How do you feel about answering healthcare related questionnaires-do you feel that they are worth your time to fill out, not worth your time, or you have neutral feelings about filling them out? Why or why not?

What cadence in receiving a questionnaire do you consider to be just the right amount of time?

Suppose the VA sent a batch of 3-6 similar questionnaires all at once, how many questionnaires in a batch would you consider to be a reasonable amount to respond to at once? I feel like I could handle more time consuming or more like 6 surveys if they gave me notice before hand. I don’t mind answering if I know it is going to help and I am prepared beforehand. So like a notification that told me how many surveys and about how long it will take me to complete, it will give me an option to opt-in or say no I don’t have time.  
How much of a notice would you like? Like a day or two. 

How would you like to receive the batch, via email or text notification?

What cadence would you expect to receive a batch of 3-6 questionnaires and why? (weekly, monthly, bi-monthly, etc..) I would be fine if it was like once a week, I could do a longer survey on my weekends. So one longer survey once a week. Or if it gave me options do you want once a month once a week, retired people might be able to do once a day. 
How long would you think is okay for a survey? Like 15 minutes 30 minutes is too long. 
So let’s say they send it to you on a Monday how long would you like the link to be active for if it was a 30 minute survey? Like a week.  Something else that would be helpful would be to have the option to add it to my calendar. 
So the ability to add to your personal calendar? Yes

Image of follow up email:
What do you think of this email? You know it gives like the resources. But I know at least for me I wouldn’t click on that I would be like well I am done. 
Why wouldn’t read that? I guess it’s because the VA brough it up and not something I am researching or something I have concerns about.
On a scale of 1-5 how valuable is this email? 
I would say 1 not very valuable.
On a scale of1-5 how difficult is this email to understand? 
1 it is very easy.
Would you add or change anything?
I would say if you want to talk to someone about possible toxic exposure here is the information to contact someone. It feels like this is basically saying good luck chuck you are on your own now. 
What would you want the VA to do for you? Like send a text or an email saying hey do you want to talk to someone about this. I think that would get more of a response then hey here is some resources. 

Additional Link sent in follow up email:
I think you know to me from what I am reading the VA is looking very specifically for these specific exposures. The survey made me feel like they were looking for a little more brooder exposure. This is saying very specific exposures.
Let’s say you had clicked yes you were exposed to one of these exposures what do you feel? This is not good enough and I would want a bigger response. This is just not enough.
Would you click on any of these? If it was related yes but no based on the last screen. 
Click on one that interests you and give me your feedback. 
Okay this is more frustrating it is just lots of clicking on links. I would rather have seen a document open right away and not a lot of links. 


After completing this questionnaire, did it change your trust in the VA in anyway?

Can you explain why you chose _____?

How can the VA increase your trust with this questionnaire?

Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes
Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies. Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

Emergency Exit
[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an emergency exit strategy. Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
