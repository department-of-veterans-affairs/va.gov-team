## Intro - 5 minutes
1.	Thanks for joining us today! My name is Jenny/Nina [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes. I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. Are you okay with them joining this session?
   
2.	Okay, great. I’ll let them know. I’ll have them turn on their cameras and introduce themselves to you and then they’ll turn their cameras back off for the remainder of the session. Let’s start with X.

3.	In this session, we are looking for your feedback on your experience with receiving and answering VA healthcare questionnaires.

4.	Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:
   
5.	This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
   
6.	In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, so I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
    
7.	Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to.
    
8.	Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in anyway with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
    
9.	I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?
	
    - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.

    - If yes: Admit observers.

    - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)

    - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth.

    - (If applicable) You'll be interacting with a prototype today. This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not.

    - Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.

    - Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

    - After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.

    - Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
Yes
    - Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences? 

    - One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image. 

    - Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. 

    - These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not, but we like to ask ahead of time. At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.

    - Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?

    - If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.

    - Start recording.

    - I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
Yes
    - Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?

- Moderator: Questions asked are based on the participant’s cohort. 
    - a.	Cohort 1-Participants from Phase 1 start at Warm-up questions
    - b.	Cohort 2-Newly recruited participants start at Continuation of warm-up question

## Warm-up questions for Cohort 1 only - 5 minutes 
1.	Before we start looking at the prototype, do you recall some of the pre-appointment questions my colleague asked you back in January during your last session with us? 
Vaguely, it’s not that I have a poor memory, it’s that I did 2 pervious and I am not sure which one it was. I remember doing it I don’t remember the details. 
- Moderator: If participant does not recall any Phase 1 questions, move to question 2.
If participant recalls the questions, then ask:

    - 1a. Do you recall what was your experience going through those questions?
    - 1b. Do you recall if the experience was positive or negative? Why?
    - 1c. Do you recall anything in particular about those questionnaires that stood out to you?

2.	We are going to go through a similar process again, but this time I’ll only show revised questions from the toxic exposure questions reminder. These revisions are based on the feedback we received from the usability sessions you participated in back in January. But before we move on to the prototype, I have a few more questions. 

- Moderator: move to Continuation of warm-up questions…


## Continuation of warm-up questions for Cohort 1 and 2 – 10 minutes

1. Since your enrollment in VA healthcare, do you recall ever receiving notifications from the VA asking you to fill out healthcare related questionnaires that were not related to a specific healthcare appointment?
I just filled out a survey about my visit or my experience with community care. I have done 3 or 4 of those they come in the mail. 
- Moderator: If participant answers no, move to question 2.
  
- If participant answers yes, then ask the following questions:
    - 1a. How did you receive this notification, was it through a text messaging, or email?
    - 1b. Do you recall if you were ever hesitant, or you ever felt uneasy to click on the VA notification, or its content due to it potentially being spam, or not from the VA? Why or why not? I would click on it if it said login to My Healthy Vet. I would know that it was safe. No one is hacking into the VA. I am so paranoid, I don’t trust anything or anybody.  
    - 1c. What would you add, delete, or change about the notification, or the link, to make you feel more confident the notification was from the VA?
    - 1d. Did any of these notifications include a link to a healthcare related questionnaire?
    - 1e. Do you recall how many questionnaires a notification contained?
    - 1f.  What was the length of time it took you to respond to the actual questionnaire(s)?
    - 1g. Do you think that is it took a reasonable amount of time to complete it, just the right amount of time, or an unreasonable amount of time? About 4-5 minutes. That is a reasonable amount of time, I don’t want to do a 15 minute one. 
    - 1h. How do you feel about answering healthcare related questionnaires-do you feel that they are worth your time to fill out, not worth your time, or you have neutral feelings about filling them out? Why or why not? How do I know if I remember what happened back in the 60’s. Someone that just got out will recall more than someone that has been out for decades. 
    - 1i. What did you expect to happen after you filled out the questionnaire(s).Do you recall about how many times between healthcare appointments, or within a 6-month period, you received similar questionnaire(s)? I don’t mind doing them, but I don’t see any result from doing them.
    - 1j. Do you recall the cadence as being infrequent, just the right amount of time, or too frequent?-What cadence do you consider to be reasonable amount of time? Every tow or three months.
    - 1k. How do you feel about receiving a skin cancer screening questionnaire even if you don’t have any upcoming healthcare appointments in the near future?   I don’t think I would have a problem with it, but I have never received one.  
    - 1l. Would you prefer to answer this type of questionnaire online or in-person at the time of your healthcare appointment? Why? I’ve gotten questionnaires before the appointment, that is his and miss. I would prefer online and in advance of the visit. I prefer an email. 
    - 1m. Suppose the VA sent you a batch of 3-6 healthcare related questionnaires all at once?
    - 1n.	How would you like to receive the batch, via email or text notification?
 Probably not!
    - 10.	How many questionnaires in a batch would you consider to be a reasonable amount to respond to at once?
    - 1p.	What cadence would you expect to receive a batch of 3-6 questionnaires and why?

- Moderator: move to Task 1.
  
2. Imagine a scenario where you are enrolled in VA healthcare, and you intermittently receive notifications from the VA asking you to fill out healthcare related questionnaires that aren’t directly related to any healthcare appointment:  
    - 2a. . How do you feel about receiving a skin cancer screening questionnaire even if you don’t have any upcoming healthcare appointments in the near future?    
    - 2b. Would you prefer to answer this type of questionnaire online or in-person at the time of your healthcare appointment.
    - 2c. How would you like receive this notification, is it through a text messaging or email?
    - 2d. What would make you hesitant, or uneasy to click on the VA notification, or its content due to it potentially being spam, or not from the VA? 
    - 2e. What would you add, delete, or change about the notification, or the link, to make you feel more confident the notification is from the VA?
    - 2f. How long would the questionnaire have to be for you to consider it to be a reasonable amount of time to complete?
    - 2g. How do you feel about answering healthcare related questionnaires-do you feel that they are worth your time to fill out, not worth your time, or you have neutral feelings about filling them out? Why or why not?
    - 2h. What do you expect to happen after you fill out healthcare related questionnaire(s).
    - 2i. What cadence in receiving a questionnaire do you consider to be just the right amount of time?
    - 2j. Suppose the VA sent a batch of 3-6 healthcare related questionnaires all at once?
    - 2k	How would you like to receive the batch, via email or text notification?
    - 2l. How many questionnaires in a batch would you consider to be:
    - 2m. a reasonable amount to respond to at oncce?
    - 2n. What cadence would you expect to receive a batch of 3-6 questionnaires and why?

- Moderator: move to Task 1.

## Task 1: Notifications - 5 minutes
- Moderator: Share your screen with image of text or email notification; which modality you show participant depends on what device they are using during session.
  
1. Ok great, we will move on to an image of a notification. Would you please tell me what device you are using for this session-are you using a desktop/laptop, tablet, or a mobile phone?

    - 2a. Is there anything about the notification that is unclear?
    - 2b. Would you add, delete, or change anything about the content within the notification? There is a lot of verbiage  in here, but I understand why they have to do it. This would be okay. 
    - 2c. How much time do you estimate it will take you to complete this questionnaire?
  
3. If you received this notification via email (or text), would you trust that it was sent from the VA? Why or why not? Because it’s https: so it is secure and it’s got dot.VA.gov so to me it’s legit.
- 3a. What would you add, delete, or change about the content to make you feel more confident that this notification came from the VA?
