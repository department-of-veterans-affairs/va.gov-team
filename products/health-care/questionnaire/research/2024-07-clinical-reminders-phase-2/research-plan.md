# Research plan for Phase 2 Health Questionnaires, Clinical Reminders Pilot: Veteran usability sessions, September 2024 

## Background 

“The Clinical Reminder system helps caregivers deliver higher quality care to patients for both preventive health care and management of chronic conditions and helps ensure that timely clinical interventions are initiated. 

Reminders assist clinical decision-making and also improve documentation and follow-up, by allowing providers to easily view dates when certain tests or evaluations were performed and to track and document when care has been delivered. They can direct providers to perform certain tests or other evaluations that will enhance the quality of care for specific conditions. The clinicians can then respond to the reminders by placing relevant orders or recording clinical activities on patients’ progress notes. 

Clinical Reminders may be used for both clinical and administrative purposes

- [Clinical Reminders Manager’s Manual](https://www.va.gov/vdl/documents/Clinical/CPRS-Clinical_Reminders/pxrm_2_mm.pdf) 

 
This pilot will focus on evaluating clinical reminders for population-based care, specifically toxic exposure screening. While the last pilot (Phase 1) included the toxic exposure screening, its focus was on reviewing the tool. This will explore a population-based clinical reminder workflow focusing on Veterans, who are unassigned (not assigned to a Primary Care team), are seen in specialty care, and are enrolled, but not active users of the VA healthcare system. This pilot will begin September 23, 2024 and will run for 8 weeks.

### OCTO Priorities 

- Enhance Veterans' personalized online experience 

### Veteran Journey 

- Taking care of myself  

- Retiring  

- Aging 

 

## Research Goals 

The purpose of this research is to gather feedback from Veterans on the revised Toxic Exposure Screening (TES) health questionnaire, using the BHL Touch questionnaire platform; additionally, we will gather Veteran feedback on the appropriate cadence of which the digital questionnaires are sent, and whether Veterans trust the that the email or text notification was sent from the VA.  And lastly, we will compare Veteran feedback from Phase 1a usability sessions to the Veteran feedback from Phase 2 Veteran usability sessions. 

 

### Research questions 

- Do Veterans trust that the clinical reminders notifications are sent from their VA provider? 
- Do Veterans find the BHL Touch’s user interface easy navigate and use, or did they have difficulties? 
- How easy are the TES questions to understand? Anything wording confusing? What would they change? 
- Do Veterans from Phase 1 find the revised questions to be an improvement, the same, or inferior to the prior version? And why? 
- Do they feel the TES questions pertained to them and their experience while they were in service? 
- Do they feel they are able to provide clarification or select options that best represents their own unique situation. 
- Do Veterans feel the revised TES questionnaire address their pain points from Phase 1.  
- Do they feel the TES questions take a reasonable amount of time to complete, or do they feel the questions are excessive and burdensome.  
- Do they feel the additional information topics are comprehensive, or would they like other of information?  
- Do Veterans feel that the TES questionnaire will help them get the appropriate healthcare services or benefits? 
- What do Veterans find is a reasonable cadence to digitally (sms text or email) receive similar questionnaires from their primary care providers. Is weekly or monthly acceptable or not? 


### Hypothesis 

- Veterans will identify areas to improve the ease of use within the questionnaire platform. 
- The questions within each clinical reminder will be understandable. 
- Veterans from Phase 1 will find the revised TES questions to be an improvement over the questions that they encountered in Phase 1. 
- Veterans will find the revised TES questions pertains to their current situation and their experience while serving. 
- Veterans will feel that the TES questionnaire will take a reasonable amount of time to complete. 
- Veterans will feel that they can request additional information that pertains to them. 
- Veterans will believe that answering the TES questions will optimize their time with their healthcare provider, will get the appropriate healthcare services they require, and obtain additional benefits the deserve.   
- Comparing Veterans responses from Phase 1 to Phase 2 will reveal an improvement in the TES questions. 
- Veterans will find a one-month cadence acceptable to receive a clinical reminder from their pcp’s. 
- Do Veterans prefer to receive the TES questions on a digital platform vs in-person.
