## Day of the Session
- Use MS Teams chat channel for real-time feedback from observers. 
- Mute your Slack notifications. 
- Send out the observer instructions to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into #feedback-backchannel).

## Introduction - 5 minutes
1. Thanks for joining us today! My name is [moderator] and I'm a researcher at OCTO working on this health questionnaires pilot.
2. There are also a few of my colleagues on the call who will be observing and taking notes. 
3. Today we're going to talk about your role as a [role], your workflow and processes using the BHL tool for sending asynchronous clinical reminder to patients.
4. Our goal is to listen and use your feedback to evaluate whether digitally sending out asynchronous clinical reminders using the BHL tool is compatible with your processes and workflows.
5. Before we start, I want to mention a couple things: 
6. We want to hear your honest opinions. We will not be offended by any opinions you express. We welcome your feedback. 
7. If for any reason, and at any time, you want to pause or end this session, just let me know. 
8. Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We just use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. None of your comments will be attributed to you directly.  
9. If we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information. Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
