P1: Well, I've never seen it, you know. Tobacco history, I think, would make more sense

163
00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:52.340
P1: rather than tobacco. Pack year. History.

164
00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:57.630
P1: tobacco history. When was the last time you smoked, do you still smoke?

165
00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.170
P1: You know. What do you smoke.

166

P1: The yeah. Toxic exposure screening.

168
00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:32.020
P1: That's a good one. I am the recipient of agent orange problems. amongst many. And then the guys Iraq Afghanistan. There they were subjected to

169
00:14:32.635 --> 00:14:41.990
P1: burn pits, toxic exposure screening. So I think those are all great categories to explore.

170
00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:46.400
Moderator: Okay, so

171
00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:53.949

Moderator: Okay, what would you like me to do if you can tell me where me to click on.

174
00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.560
P1: Okay, let's do.

175
00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:15.200
P1: Well, let's go right down the list. Homelessness, food, insecurity.

176
00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:16.000
Moderator: Okay.

177
00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:19.459

Moderator: So if you can read this out loud, please.

179
00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:52.509
P1: Okay, the Va. Is committed to ending homelessness among veterans. Our focus is threefold, conducting coordinated outreach to proactive proactively seek out veterans in need of assistance, connecting homelessness and at risk veterans with housing solutions, healthcare community employment services, and other required supports.

180
00:15:53.190 --> 00:16:05.210
P1: collaborating with Federal State and local agencies, employers, housing providers, fair based or faith-based and community nonprofits, and others to

181
00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:18.869
P1: expand employment and affordable business housing business, affordable housing options for veterans exiting homelessness. Your response to the following questions

182
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.009

00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:28.020
Moderator: Neat any comments, any.

184
00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:40.045
P1: Yeah, I homelessness is a tough one, because

185
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.180
P1: it's supplying the veteran with a place to stay.

186
00:16:47.300 --> 00:17:00.319
P1: But then there's all the rest of it. I mean, the home is just the shell. Now you've got some financial need or some financial issues to help them out.

187
00:17:01.064 --> 00:17:11.220
P1: Maybe employment issues to help out the veteran. So it's a really complicated homelessness is

188
00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:27.229
P1: a huge issue, because you just can't plunk someone in in one of those little veterans, cubicles that some communities are building. I think that's a tough one to solve. I really do.

189
00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:32.749
P1: And I've never been in that scenario, so I can't relate to it.

193
00:17:57.790 --> 00:18:09.209
P1: Are you worried or concerned that in the next 2 months you may not have stable housing, that you own rent, or stay in as part of no, not worried about housing in the near future.

194
00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:14.269
P1: I think those are good questions. The VHA.

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:14.720
Moderator: What- what do you think it is? [Redacted PII].

203
00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:18.769
P1: Veterans housing authority.

204
00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:28.420
Moderator: So it could be. But mostly it's veterans. Health administration.

205
00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:37.580
P1: Oh, okay, alright, alright, I just haven't seen that abbreviation before. So I, okay.

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:44.010
Moderator: Okay.

209
00:19:44.620 --> 00:20:03.579
P1: Yeah, because you've already put in parentheses the Food Security Office. So Vha isn't so, it's like what? And you heard my answer, it's like I was in the ballpark with veterans, but the rest, you know, housing, authority, health.

210
00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:04.680
P1: L.

222
00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:48.609

230
00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:12.049
P1: Everything else was easy.

241
00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:27.149

245
00:22:53.850 --> 00:23:01.450
P1: Oh, boy, that's right. And you're dealing with veterans in their 20 somethings. And me and my 70 somethings.

246
00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:07.000
P1: Yeah, that's frightening to think about. But

P1: we would go through the questions before I saw the doctor, I thought, well, it's a little invasive. But no, no, it's not. It's something you really need to delve in beyond the

255
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:53.699
P1: you know your temperature and your blood pressure nowadays.

256
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:59.510

263
00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:32.610
P1: Click on the tobacco.

264
00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:42.010
P1: Hey? Do you smoke? Cigarettes? Do not factor in any other tobacco usage, including e-cigarettes.

265
00:24:42.360 --> 00:25:01.199
P1: I smoke cigarettes every day. I've used cigarettes in the past, but quit, and during my currently use I've never smoked or I've smoked fewer than 100 cigarettes in my lifetime. I decline the screening, or am I okay? So I would click on. I've used cigarettes in the past, but quit.

266
00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:03.730
P1: Do not currently use them.

267
00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:13.950
P1: How long ago, great, greater than or now that's a little

268
00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:20.260
P1: I would click on greater than or equal to 15 years ago.

269
00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:26.910
P1: Oh, great, no, it it's just the

270
00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:39.559
P1: when I 1st read it I had to read it again. So greater than 15 years. Yeah, like 50, but equal to 50 years. That threw me a little bit, I mean.

271
00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:47.350
P1: I would think it would say less than 15 years, 15 years or more. You know something like that. It just

272
00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:49.720
P1: seemed a little awkward.

273
00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:56.710
Moderator: Okay. So the way it was phrased, Yeah, I didn't.

274

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:17.439
Moderator: Yes, any terms that were unfamiliar or confusing, other than the awkward phrase.

279
00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:20.250
P1: No everything else was easy.

280
00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:27.019

P1: Oi. Okay, as required by the housing or by the honoring our Pact Act.

283
00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:55.029
P1: I always. I love that term. It's just got a nice, you know. Bounce to it. The pack act. Okay the Va. Is screening, you can tell. I'm quiet and shy right.

284
00:26:55.980 --> 00:27:09.200
P1: The Va. Is screening all enrolled veterans for potential toxic exposure and offering toxic exposure, screening information at least every 5 years, which I think is great

285
00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:23.910
P1: possible exposures include airborne hazards and open burn, pit. L. 4 related exposure agent, orange radiation camp lesion contaminated water exposure. That is a

286
00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:48.520
P1: when I saw that it's like you've got to be kidding me. Other exposures. Participation in the survey is voluntary. If you choose not to answer will not change your benefits. It should take less than 5 min to complete all information is confidential is required by law. This survey follows the rules of the Paperwork Reduction Act.

P1: Well, it it's great. I mean it really.

291
00:28:13.630 --> 00:28:18.920
P1: The military is now understanding that there's a lot of

292
00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:40.629
P1: stupid things. No wrong word. A lot of things out there that can be detrimental to military personnel health where they're stationed at different places around the world. I think it's probably one of the most important

293
00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:49.460
P1: categories, because it's long term it could be. For the rest, it is for the rest of your life.

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:08.751
P1: I would click on. Yes, and

307
00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:12.779
P1: yeah, the I don't know is important, too, because

308
00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:22.319
P1: you don't know. I mean, there's {Redacted PII] that the military is going to discover. It's like, Oh, yeah.

309
00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:27.542
P1: this this specific element that we use for

310
00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:32.960
P1: computer whatever is toxic. Now, crazy.

311
00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:37.540
P1: do you believe that you were exposed to the following, while serving in the armed forces.

312
00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:55.520
P1: airborne hazards open pit occurring in the Southwest Asia. After 1990 Gulf War related exposures, agent, orange radiation camp Lejeune contaminated water exposures. Other exposures. I would click on agent orange.

313
00:30:58.510 --> 00:31:00.101
Moderator: What would you do next.

314
00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:02.140
P1: But click on, continue.

315
00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:08.329
Moderator: Before we move on. Anything unexpected or unclear.

316
00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:09.720
P1: No.

317
00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:10.665
Moderator: Okay.

318
00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:24.700
P1: Okay, these are medical conditions that have been found to be potentially related agent orange exposure.

319
00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:42.670
P1: These are called presumptive conditions. If you have any of these conditions you should file a claim for disability and compensation. Additional information will be included in the educational material you will receive to date to minimize the long term impacts of exposure

320
00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:45.180
P1: on your health and

321
00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:55.050
P1: what that on your health and what

322
00:31:55.170 --> 00:31:57.440
P1: doesn't look like. It's a word.

323
00:31:58.270 --> 00:32:00.970
P1: Oh, it's supposed to be safety.

324
00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:06.819
P1: It is important that you are engaged with ongoing Va. Health care.

325
00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:10.060
P1: Oh, oh, life! Okay. It just looked

326
00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:15.300
P1: okay, like your ha! That's what I thought the word was, but it looks

327
00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:18.659
P1: weird on the screen. I don't know why.

328
00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:26.950
P1: and then I would click on the links.

329
00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:30.419
Moderator: Okay, which one would you want to click on.

330
00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:31.440
P1: Oh, boy!

331
00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:32.070
Moderator: Okay.

332
00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:40.520
P1: I seek public health the middle one.

333
00:32:46.510 --> 00:32:49.790
Moderator: Is this what you expected or not expected?

334
00:32:53.285 --> 00:32:58.610
P1: Yes, and I've gone through the list myself. I don't. I don't really want to

335
00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:10.400
P1: read through everything. But I've gone through all of those issues, and I am registered. What is it registered for the agent? Orange

336
00:33:11.150 --> 00:33:12.290
P1: system?

337
00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:32.370
P1: so I follow. If I hear anything about the Va. Or the Va sends me something. I do get a Va email, just a general update on things. And I do check that out. Yeah. And now for the for the younger

338
00:33:32.490 --> 00:33:40.983
P1: veterans. The QR. Code is important for me. It's like, okay, fine

339
00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:50.610
P1: care less. But I like, I want to read a newspaper. I want to read a newsletter where I'm holding it.

340
00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:54.230
P1: Emails drive me nuts. So

341
00:33:54.729 --> 00:34:04.870
P1: I no, I shouldn't say emails drive me nuts, a newsletter that I have to read online. I don't care for I would rather have hard copy.

342
00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:06.530
P1: Excuse me.

343
00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:10.090
Moderator: Okay, so what would you do next.

344
00:34:12.929 --> 00:34:13.840
P1: Well

345
00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:23.979
P1: for, for though I think it's important because it's current is to click on what the pact act means for your Va. Benefits.

346
00:34:26.539 --> 00:34:29.579
P1: Do you want to click on this, then?

347
00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:30.380
P1: Yes.

348
00:34:34.199 --> 00:34:36.080
P1: and I've gone.

349
00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:40.009
P1: Can I scroll myself or no? You're going to scroll.

350
00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:42.980
Moderator: Now I'm going to scroll. Would you like me to scroll down.

351
00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:44.189
P1: Yeah. Go ahead.

352
00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:46.838
Moderator: And they just tell me when to stop.

353
00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:53.320
P1: Now I keep going. I've gone through. Keep going.

354
00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:00.860
P1: Keep going all the way.

355
00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:11.960
P1: Okay, I've gone through that, and I think it's very informative.

356
00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:20.940
P1: The questions and the answers are very informative, because I applied for the act and

357
00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:29.299
P1: actually got the another 10% for the controlled

358
00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:34.450
P1: high blood pressure or the high blood pressure with medication.

359
00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:44.849
P1: So it was very important to understand what the current benefit is under the packet.

360
00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:52.369
Moderator: Okay, so what would you want to do next? Now let's say you read through this.

361
00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:57.593
Moderator: What's what would you like to do next in terms of the prototype.

362
00:35:58.269 --> 00:36:04.460
P1: Just if that's the bottom line, then I guess I'd be done. I don't know if there's a continue there.

363
00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:05.415
P1: But

364
00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:08.909
P1: That would be it. I've

365
00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:22.229
P1: feedback. I I'm good with everything the way it was. But I like the fact that it says Feedback. Because that's what we just did here.

366
00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:27.240
P1: So somebody getting this application going through it? The hard copy?

367
00:36:28.610 --> 00:36:36.370
P1: yeah, I'm I might have answered some of the situations that we talked about, but I think it's good.

368
00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:49.937
Moderator: So do you feel like there's this questionnaire is completed, or yes, yes, yes, alright. So

369
00:36:55.950 --> 00:37:02.939
Moderator: okay. So I'm going to just ask you a few more questions. I'm going to stop sharing my screen.

370
00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:20.280
Moderator: I'm sorry.

371
00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:27.810
P1: Where are you? Where are you recording this from? Just curious.

372
00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:36.139
Moderator: So I am remotely I am from[Redacted}. Right now. I live here.

373
00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:37.640
P1: Okay. All right.

374
00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:39.330
Moderator: No, I'm.

375
00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:44.039
P1: I'm I've been to 48 of 50 States.

376
00:37:44.240 --> 00:38:00.840
P1: You could probably guess one, but not the other. And I just. I've traveled a lot over the years, so I always been curious where people are from, especially any customer service thing. Now, you could be from anywhere.

377
00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:01.500
Moderator: Right, yeah.

378
00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:11.449
P1: You know, Fidelity Fund is based in Boston. I think the customer service people are all over the place.

379
00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:13.030
P1: Okay.

380
00:38:13.370 --> 00:38:19.229
Moderator: So can you tell me overall what is your impression of this prototype?

381
00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:20.860
P1: Easy.

382
00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:22.530
Moderator: Okay.

383
00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:26.469
P1: Easy to read and pretty simple to go through.

384
00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:32.169
P1: It's pointed questions you don't. There's not a lot of ambiguity there.

385
00:38:32.652 --> 00:38:40.980
Moderator: Okay. What parts of the experience? Do you feel like it worked as expected or unexpected?

386
00:38:41.330 --> 00:38:41.990
P1: No anything.

387
00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:45.500
P1: Yeah, it was very clear.

388
00:38:46.082 --> 00:38:52.409
P1: And yeah, I think Bob was the only one for the last

389
00:38:53.040 --> 00:39:00.559
P1: topic was something where it just read. Funny, I can't remember what it was. The bottom one.

390
00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:04.770
Moderator: Would it help if we go back to the prototype.

391
00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:09.170
P1: No, no, I think we're. We're fine.

392
00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:18.800
Moderator: All right. So were there anything that that caught you off guard, or didn't match with what you expected at all?

393
00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:21.740
P1: No, no it all made sense.

394
00:39:22.090 --> 00:39:28.420
P1: And again, very simple. That's the way, you know. Yet it

395
00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:55.640
P1: all the questions is a yes or no, I mean a lot, most of them. And if it's yes, then you define in detail how you would answer that question, and I guess the only one that threw me was the sexual orientation where I don't know. It's scary for me, because there are a very few people in that category. It's like.

396
00:39:55.770 --> 00:40:00.330
P1: Oh, my God! Thank goodness, I'm where I am in life.

397
00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:06.260
P1: because I pretty much know where what I am, where I am, so.

398
00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:18.460
Moderator: So, [Redacted PII], let's say you- you were in the middle of the questionnaire, and you had to step away and maybe return later to it. What do you expect to happen to it?

399
00:40:22.350 --> 00:40:28.899
P1: that my screen would go to screensaver, and I'd have to click on it again to back. Get back to the question

400
00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:30.480
P1: that makes sense.

401
00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:31.020
Moderator: Yes.

402
00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:34.469
P1: Because it should, and I guess it actually should go to

403
00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:38.209
P1: Screensaver if I'm gone for 5 min.

404
00:40:38.310 --> 00:40:52.469
Moderator: Okay? So you would expect. So the screen saver do, can you be more specific when you mean screen saver? Do you mean the screen will be, will go back to where it was, or.

405
00:40:52.470 --> 00:41:04.270
P1: Oh, yeah, it will, after I probably just click on it or move my, my mouse it would go right back to where I left off.

406
00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:11.660
Moderator: Okay, so let's say you had to. You had to leave the questionnaire for some reason, and then.

407
00:41:12.395 --> 00:41:22.430
Moderator: several hours later, you clicked on the link again, and you went back to finish the remainder of the questionnaire. What would you expect to happen.

408
00:41:23.569 --> 00:41:28.179
P1: I know what I would like to happen is that where it would

409
00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:36.810
P1: be at where I left it, going through the questionnaire not back to the beginning again, and have to scroll through everything.

410
00:41:36.970 --> 00:41:37.450
Moderator: Okay.

411
00:41:37.450 --> 00:41:41.099
P1: I would expect that it would just freeze at that point.

412
00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:48.279
Moderator: Okay. So once you click on the link, you expect to go to the exact screen where you left off.

413
00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:56.189
P1: Yes, I it would. It would be nice to do that, you know, but I know it doesn't happen that way with

414
00:41:56.630 --> 00:42:02.759
P1: whoever is, is doing these things, you know. Surveys. A lot of them might.

415
00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:03.570
Moderator: Preference.

416
00:42:03.570 --> 00:42:05.110
P1: Yeah, it would. It would.

417
00:42:05.110 --> 00:42:22.550
Moderator: Okay, so how do you feel about using this type of tool of doing this digitally, asynchronously? How do you feel about sharing your personal health information this way. Do you feel safe? Do you feel that it's secure.

418
00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:35.049
P1: Yeah, I do. I do I can trust about as much as I can trust with the with the Va. {Redacted PII] always happens that.

419
00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:36.320
P1: you know, can

420
00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:42.929
P1: it? {Redacted PII], app {Redacted PII] goes wrong. But yeah, I'm comfortable with it. And like, I said.

421
00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:59.389
P1: maybe 10 years ago getting some of these questions thrown at me. And again, it's all always been going to the Va. Matter of fact, I'm going in about a month. A month from now is my regular checkup.

422
00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:12.370
P1: and I'll go in there and I'll get they'll do the weight, and maybe the height sometimes, and the nurse will do the blood pressure and go through a lot of

423
00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:14.999
P1: questions just like these.

424
00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:18.599
P1: And I like that. But way back, when it's like.

425
00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:27.979
P1: what matter of fact, one of the questions that they do ask there's a couple is, do you have any firearms at home?

426
00:43:29.490 --> 00:43:30.200
Moderator: Yeah.

427
00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:30.530
P1: Yeah.

428
00:43:31.170 --> 00:43:32.370
Moderator: That's an important question.

429
00:43:32.370 --> 00:43:38.560
P1: I. Yeah, it is an important question. When I 1st heard that, it's like, you know, I think.

430
00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:50.049
P1: yeah, I don't know why, but me, and probably a lot of other guys I've talked to. It's like, Oh, hell! Come on, you know, that's really getting nosy.

431
00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:58.409
P1: But it is important. I think it is important nowadays, because again, it's taking into account

432
00:43:58.550 --> 00:44:06.630
P1: really the overall health of a person physically, mentally. Yeah.

433
00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:08.130
Moderator: Exactly.

434
00:44:08.130 --> 00:44:11.860
P1: Environmentally. In other words, your environment. What's in it?

435
00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:15.980
P1: You know. It's a steady household homelessness.

436
00:44:16.130 --> 00:44:23.749
P1: You know that that one I can't address, because I haven't been there, and it scares me that there are enough

437
00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:33.289
P1: small minority of veterans that are in that situation. It's like God. I've never been in that scenario, thank goodness! So.

438
00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:44.230
Moderator: So, [Redacted PII], what did you think of the length of time that it took for you to go through the experience? Would you say it was reasonable or unreasonable.

439
00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:52.229
P1: No, it was reasonable. It was because it's a very pointed questions that you can go through it pretty quickly.

440
00:44:52.660 --> 00:45:05.829
Moderator: Okay. So you had mentioned that you had never answered a questionnaire on online via email or text, is that correct? Or is it just from your Va. Provider that you.

441
00:45:05.830 --> 00:45:08.230
P1: Oh, just from the Va Provider.

442
00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:14.620
Moderator: Okay, but you have answered them online before from others. Sources for what.

443
00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:15.000
P1: Yes.

444
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:22.559
Moderator: How do you think this prototype, compared to ones that you've experienced in the past.

445
00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:30.104
P1: Okay, let's let me just think. Here,

446
00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:44.799
P1: well, the one with my civilian doctor goes into a lot of a lot more detail

447
00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:53.739
P1: about well, family history. Your history, you know. Have you ever suffered from gout?

448
00:45:54.210 --> 00:45:56.541
P1: You know that kind of thing?

449
00:45:57.160 --> 00:46:03.160
P1: and have you traveled outside of the country in the last, whatever they say, 30 days.

450
00:46:03.350 --> 00:46:04.040
Moderator: Dumb.

451
00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:11.927
P1: So there's the civilian questionnaire that I have filled out online, which I just did

452
00:46:13.129 --> 00:46:18.880
P1: about a month ago, going backwards was a lot more detailed.

453
00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:20.120
Moderator: Okay.

454
00:46:20.250 --> 00:46:32.999
Moderator: So if you can change just one thing about the prototype or the questionnaire experience just overall, what? What would you change about what you've experienced today?

455
00:46:33.486 --> 00:46:38.410
P1: I think I would add, family history.

456
00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:42.299
P1: That's a tough one, because a lot of people

457
00:46:42.850 --> 00:46:48.820
P1: really don't know the details of mom and dad kind of the thing or your siblings.

458
00:46:48.830 --> 00:47:06.320
P1: But I think it's a good question, because it gives a good indication. Oh, yeah, my dad had cancer. Well, then, I probably am susceptible to getting prostate cancer. You know that thing.

459
00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:20.780
P1: Or my mom had congenital heart failure. Well, there's an issue that the doctor can focus on. There's an issue of heart in the family. There's an issue of cancer in the family. So I think it's good.

460
00:47:21.210 --> 00:47:27.389
P1: I think that's a good addition is especially the family history.

461
00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:37.079
Moderator: Okay? So put in the questions aside. But the actual experience of clicking through the prototype

462
00:47:37.390 --> 00:47:40.249
Moderator: and the way that the

463
00:47:40.370 --> 00:47:52.502
Moderator: the interface just the way everything was laid out. How would you feel about interacting with this prototype? Let's say each

464
00:47:53.040 --> 00:48:11.770
Moderator: every 3 months or so the Va. Would send you different questionnaires. But using the same prototype. Which did you find that it was a positive or a negative experience just going through the, you know, clicking through it, how? How our information was laid out.

465
00:48:11.770 --> 00:48:14.499
P1: Yeah, I think it would be positive.

466
00:48:14.910 --> 00:48:16.000
Moderator: Okay.

467
00:48:17.050 --> 00:48:20.139
P1: Yeah, I really do things change.

468
00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:34.160
Moderator: Okay, so would you. Would you be very dissatisfied, dissatisfied, neither dissatisfied nor satisfied, satisfied or very satisfied.

469
00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:38.640
P1: Sorry, very satisfied.

470
00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:46.510
Moderator: Very satisfied. Okay, so okay, that's all I have before we close. Do you have any questions for me, [Redacted PII]?

471
00:48:48.016 --> 00:48:51.403
P1: No, I like this. I like doing this.

472
00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:52.420
Moderator: Oh, that's.

473
00:48:52.804 --> 00:48:56.260
P1: I do. I mean, I like doing it.

474
00:48:58.020 --> 00:49:05.380
P1: I don't like doing because they screw it up. But I like doing these.

475
00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:10.700
P1: because I've done prototypes for the VA way back when

476
00:49:11.254 --> 00:49:14.486
P1: and I like to help my fellow veterans.

477
00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:25.309
P1: yeah, like, I said, I'm in my late seventies, and any way I can help for the for the youngsters, because I was there once upon a time.

478
00:49:25.921 --> 00:49:36.539
P1: And I think I think it's really important. I did a prototype like this in person with an interviewer with

479
00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:43.550
P1: who observers in other rooms for the app for the Va app.

480
00:49:45.810 --> 00:49:56.029
P1: you know how, and I was holding my smartphone, and then they put it on my smartphone. So how easy or difficult is it to do this? Oh.

481
00:49:56.580 --> 00:49:58.999
Moderator: That must have been very exciting.

482
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.679
P1: Yeah. It's worked out pretty good.

483
00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:07.223
Moderator: So I'm just going to ask my colleagues if they have any questions. I know Kristen's

484
00:50:09.260 --> 00:50:15.500
Moderator: the Kristen's audio isn't working. I don't know if she'd like to add anything in the chat

485
00:50:17.090 --> 00:50:19.770
Moderator: Chantelle. Do you have any questions.

486
00:50:22.460 --> 00:50:23.870
Notetaker: I don't think I do.

487
00:50:24.250 --> 00:50:52.779
Moderator: Okay, great. All right, [Redacted PII]. So we really appreciate you taking your time to share with us today. Your feedback is very helpful as we continue to make sure that all of our digital products work for veterans before you go, I just want to let you know that everything today was not real, and the questions that you answered were not submitted to your provider in any way.

488
00:50:52.780 --> 00:51:10.410
Moderator: And lastly, Perry, Jean will be sending you a note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other veterans that you may know to provide them with a chance to participate as you did today. So we really appreciate it. And thank you again, [Redacted PII]. Have a great day.

489
00:51:10.410 --> 00:51:12.400
