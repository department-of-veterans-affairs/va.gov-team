422
00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:42.680
P3:The questions were easy. The getting back and forth in the computer was a little difficult.

423
00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:50.789
Moderator: Maybe because I'm not familiar with the computer, or maybe going back and forth, or my computer is not answering, or I don't know how to use my computer.

Moderator: or that stood out to you.

430
00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:26.590
P3:Actually, the question was, if I ever been exposed to

431
00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:30.790
P3:any toxic exposure. But I don't know. I'm not.

432
00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:34.210
P3:Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. So.

433
00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:42.100
Moderator: Okay? So the toxic exposure question was, you had questions about that.

434
00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:45.909
P3:Because I don't know if I was exposed to anything like that, so

435
00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:49.039
P3:I never I never pay attention to that.

436
00:38:49.910 --> 00:39:06.589

439
00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:18.190

440
00:39:19.451 --> 00:39:23.680
P3:Getting in and back and forth. I probably have a little hard time getting in.

00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:27.060
P3:probably get frustrated and then leave it alone. What's that.

442
00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:31.260

P3:Because I was having problems getting in with your help.

445
00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:41.419

P3:and if I was having problems with your help. One. Next thing that I want to do it by myself. Most likely I will get frustrated, and I just like forget about it. I just leave it alone and walk away and leave it alone. Never come back.

447
00:39:54.330 --> 00:40:00.989

460
00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:58.379
Moderator: to other questionnaires that you've taken on your P3:? Do you have something to compare it to.

461
00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:00.220
P3:Yeah, they're similar.

462
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:01.710
Moderator: Similar.

463
00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:06.960
P3:They're similar. But going back and forth, going back and forth. That was kind of

464
00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:13.120
P3:the questions are just back to back. I didn't. I don't have to go back and forth, back and forth.

465
00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:21.790
Moderator: Okay. So when you say you want the questions back back to back, can you elaborate on that a little bit.

466
00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:29.270
P3:Like I didn't have to go like we finish one section. Then we go back again.

467
00:41:29.830 --> 00:41:37.350
P3:When I say back to back, I said like, instead of going back and forth all the questions in one page, instead of going.

468
00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:39.909
P3:you know, back and forth.

469
00:41:40.330 --> 00:41:43.147
Moderator: Okay, yeah, you'd like it more seamless.

470
00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:44.430
P3:Yes.

471
00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:52.380
Moderator: Okay. So if- if you could change one thing about the entire experience, what would it be.

472
00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:55.629
P3:Let me change

473
00:41:55.890 --> 00:42:00.980
P3:that one thing. Just have one thing, so I don't have to go back and forth. Just do everything

474
00:42:01.350 --> 00:42:08.330
P3:at once, not going back again, you know, not losing you, not finding you.

475
00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:30.369
Moderator: Okay? And so and and then last question, how do you feel about using the this type of prototype digital questionnaires to answer your per[Redacted PII}al health information. Do you feel like it's safe, secure? Do you feel comfortable or uncomfort?

476
00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:32.259
P3:I do feel comfortable.

477
00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:34.070
Moderator: Could you explain why?

478
00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:38.449
P3:Cause I have nothing to hide. And

479
00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.540
P3:just being honest, you guys want to know.

480
00:42:41.730 --> 00:42:46.409
P3:you guys, wanna I think you guys wanna help every veteran. So I just

481
00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:49.310
P3:being honest. What you want to know is.

482
00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:50.325
Moderator: Okay.

483
00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:59.490
Moderator: Alright, that's all that I have for today. But before I let you go, do you have any questions for me?

484
00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:03.910
P3:How do I get help for the food stamps and stuff like that?

485
00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:09.535
Moderator: Okay, I can put I can track that down for you. I do

486
00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:15.216
Moderator: get that information to you. I'll make a note of that

487
00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:19.409
Moderator: so like information on food stamps.

488
00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:27.550
P3:And also budgetary budgeting. There was another question that I say that I that's the other thing that I would like to help get help with.

489
00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:39.110
Moderator: Okay. I'll try to see if I can get a contact for you, and then will most likely relay the information back to you.

490
00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:40.430
P3:That's good man.

491
00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:49.869
Moderator: Okay? I'm just gonna ask my colleagues if they have any questions for you. Do you have any questions for [Redacted PII]?

492
00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:54.650
Observer 1: This is Sean. I don't have any questions. I just greatly appreciate your time.

493
00:43:54.810 --> 00:43:56.199
P3:Okay. Sean, thank you.
