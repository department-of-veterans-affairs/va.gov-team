00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:07.640
P4: Yes.

3
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.592
Moderator: Great. Thank you.

4
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:35.279
Moderator: So, as I mentioned before, we are going to pretend that you're at. You have a doctor's appointment in about 2 days’ time from now, and your doctor has emailed you some questionnaires for you to complete before your appointment. And so, I'm going to link a prototype in the chat.

5
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.919
Moderator: and what I'm going to do is

6
00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:48.240
Moderator: you can click on it. And then I'm going to ask you to share your screen. But then don't do anything until after I'm done.

7
00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.979
Moderator: And are you familiar with sharing your screen now.

8
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:01.950
P4: I should be able to figure it out.

9
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.349
Moderator: Okay. So, there's the link in the chat, and you can just click on it and then share your screen. Please.

10
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.300
P4: To me.

11
00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.530
Moderator: So that you should be able to figure it out. Where's the share? Button video

12
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.590
Moderator: a on the bottom? It's green.

13
00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.615
P4: Oh, green! There it is!

14
00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:38.560
P4: That works!

15
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.890
Moderator: It? Yes.

16
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.930
Moderator: So, if we can go to the prototype, it should be.

17
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.030
Moderator: it should be in one of the tabs.

18
00:01:52.160 --> 00:02:05.169
Moderator: Can we check. Yeah, there it is. Great. That's it. So, I'm going to ask you to use the information I provided for you. To

19
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.470
Moderator: to authenticate. Please.

20
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.859
P4: Where's the chat?

21
00:02:18.951 --> 00:02:22.380
Moderator: You need to go back on Zoom, I believe.

22
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.248
Moderator: Yeah, I'm trying to find it.

23
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:33.809
Moderator: Okay, I'll just tell you if you can go back to the tab of the prototype. I'll just let you. I'll give you the information.

24
00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:34.589
P4: Oh, okay.

25
00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:42.409
P4: Oh, where is.

26
00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.790
Moderator: Cute.

27
00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.954
P4: Okay.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.730

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.035
P4: 14.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.689
Moderator: 14. Yes, the number 14. Yes.

34
00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:27.400
Moderator: okay. So, before you do anything, [Redacted PII], I'm going to ask you to read everything out loud, and just give me your opinion on the screen, if you notice anything, and

35
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:34.270
Moderator: then I'll ask you to answer the questions or move on to the next thing.

36
00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.720
P4: Please answer a few questions to help the Va. Better understand your medical needs.

37
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.470
Moderator: Okay, do you have? Do you go ahead.

38
00:03:42.186 --> 00:03:45.770
P4: Homeless homelessness, food, insecurity, screen.

39
00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:55.219
Moderator: Okay, do you notice anything about the screen that you'd like to comment on?

40
00:03:55.557 --> 00:04:04.999
P4: Well, I don't know if it's a screen or a screening like below. It talks about screening. This one. Looks like it's a home screen or a

41
00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.280
P4: page.

42
00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.922
P4: I mean by having the word screen.

43
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:13.580
P4: You know, and it also.

44
00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.700
P4: I'm just looking at all 4 at the same time, too. It's like, you know, if I'm

45
00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:24.200
P4: you said I'm supposed to be setting up a meeting in 2 days or preparation.

46
00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.129
P4: This is preparation for an appointment, a scheduled appointment.

47
00:04:29.078 --> 00:04:31.389
Moderator: So, this is essential.

48
00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:49.420
Moderator: yes, it. It's essentially asking you questions about your healthcare needs or potential healthcare needs. So, it's yes. So, it's in preparation for your appointment. But it could. It's not directly

49
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:58.830
Moderator: asking you questions affiliated with your appointment. So, it may have questions that that's not directly yeah.

50
00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.160
P4: I mean, I would rephrase the top question to better understand you.

51
00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:11.280
P4: not because, you know it's not really your medical needs. It's, you know my sexual orientation has nothing to do with any medical need.

52
00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.989
P4: It's you want to understand me; do I have homelessness?

53
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.849
P4: Yeah, my do I have food insecurity. Do I use tobacco.

54
00:05:19.982 --> 00:05:22.940
P4: you know? Have I had toxic exposure?

55
00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:24.569
P4: But that's right.

56
00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:26.759
P4: That'd be the big one. I'd speak.

57
00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:39.180
Moderator: Okay. So, I'm going to ask you to just move through this, as you normally would if you were at home. And please read the question, read the entire summary, and then

58
00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:41.689
Moderator: I'll ask you again.

59
00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.710
P4: The Va. Is committed, read it out loud, or read it to myself.

60
00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.430
Moderator: I read it out loud, please.

61
00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.509
P4: Va. It is committed to ending homelessness amongst veterans. Our focus is threefold.

62
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.659
P4: conducting coordinated outreach to proactively seek out veterans in need of assistance.

63
00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:04.569
P4: connecting homeless and at-risk veterans with housing solutions, healthcare community employment services, and other required supports.

64
00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:13.789
P4: I don't know if you need that. S. Collaborating with federal, state and local agencies, employers, housing providers, faith based

65
00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:24.060
P4: community nonprofits, and others to expand employment and affordable housing options for veterans exiting homelessness.

66
00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:30.299
P4: Your response to the following questions will enable us to provide any assistance you may need.

67
00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:33.110
Moderator: There.

68
00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:38.470
Moderator: Is there anything unclear or unexpected on this page?

69
00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:51.049
P4: Oh, no, it doesn't really address the food insecurity. But that's okay.

70
00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:52.829
Moderator: What would you like it?

71
00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:57.369
Moderator: To what? In what information would you like it? To continue.

72
00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.609
P4: Well, I don't know if continuing means

73
00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:04.090
P4: there's more. Is it more coming or not. But.

74
00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:11.260
P4: Didn't the last paragraph or they didn't this whole section talk about food, insecurity, and homelessness?

75
00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:18.860
P4: Then I would expect in the title, it says, homelessness and food insecurity.

76
00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:27.849
P4: and then it had. It would have a bullet about because you can have a house and still not or have shelter and still be hungry.

77
00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:31.470
P4: So that would be the big thing.

78
00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.300
Moderator: Okay, go ahead. Please move on.

79
00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:38.690
P4: If in the past 2 months have you been living in

80
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:42.919
P4: stable housing that you own rent or stay in as part of a household.

81
00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.280
P4: Let me click both of them.

82
00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:53.239
P4: Are you worried or concerned that in the next 2 months you may not have stable housing.

83
00:07:53.640 --> 00:08:02.240
Moderator: Before you click on anything. I'm just going to ask you if there's anything unclear on this page on each page before you move on.

84
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:06.080
P4: Nope.

85
00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:09.100
Moderator: Now, okay, you can move on. Please.

86
00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:14.330
P4: The VHA. Food.

87
00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:20.639
P4: V. You may want to spell VHA, because most people don't know what that is. I think it's

88
00:08:21.206 --> 00:08:25.353
P4: veterans’ health administration. Maybe I don't know. Food Security Office

89
00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:34.869
P4: supports a veteran comprehensive health and well-being by ensuring food security. Our mission is to provide resources to Va healthcare systems

90
00:08:35.636 --> 00:08:47.433
P4: through partnerships, data, management, research, and education, to support an interdisciplinary approach to ensuring veteran food security and create an environment where all veterans are food and nutrition secure

91
00:08:48.421 --> 00:08:52.519
P4: your response to the following questions will be used to help connect

92
00:08:53.180 --> 00:09:06.770
P4: you with resources. I, looking to hearing that you bring in the food safety. I almost think that back at the beginning it ought to be 2 different sections, because and separate homelessness from food security.

93
00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.999
Moderator: Okay. So, when you say back in the beginning.

94
00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:13.010
P4: The main screen where the 4 bullets were. There.

95
00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:13.585
Moderator: Okay.

96
00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:19.599
P4: And you might want to separate those twos because they are different.

97
00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:22.003
Moderator: Okay. Alright.

98
00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:24.530
Moderator: Correct.

99
00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:31.809
P4: The past within the past 12 months. Are you? Were you worried that your food would run out before you had money to buy more.

100
00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:36.750
Moderator: Is there anything unclear on here.

101
00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:43.230
P4: Well, the way it's written, it's a yes or no question. Are you worried? Yes or no.

102
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.389
P4: as an if, and then you have 3 options. So, if you have 3 options, you'd want to say.

103
00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:56.489
P4: Do you know which blower? Which of the blue below is true just to phrase it

104
00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:58.780
P4: often sometimes never.

105
00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:00.760
Moderator: Go ahead!

106
00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.359
P4: Otherwise. You, I mean, I think

107
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:05.150
P4: just a yes or no would suffice.

108
00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:08.500
P4: Cause you're saying, within the 12 past 12 months

109
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:12.400
P4: you either had food problems or you did not.

110
00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:14.780
Moderator: Okay, and.

111
00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:17.379
P4: Then you'd want to engage the veteran from that.

112
00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.670
P4: Would you like a referral for any of the following services?

113
00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:30.629
P4: No help, no referral help obtaining food, stamps or meals on wheels.

114
00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:37.140
P4: location of nearby food pantries or soup kitchens, help planning, preparing meals, extending your food.

115
00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:40.840
P4: I'm already receiving necessary.

116
00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:43.790
P4: Oh.

117
00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.250
Moderator: Anything unclears here.

118
00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:51.440
P4: No.

119
00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:54.459
Moderator: Okay, ask you to move on.

120
00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:03.040
P4: Do you like a referral for any of the following services? Oh, I have to.

121
00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:05.389
P4: No, I have to select some.

122
00:11:06.365 --> 00:11:06.910
P4: Okay.

123
00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:10.849
Moderator: Before you move on. Is this what you expected.

124
00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.540
P4: For it to be back at the main screen.

125
00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:15.250
Moderator: Yes.

126
00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.190
P4: No.

127
00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.319
Moderator: I mean, I've right.

128
00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:26.089
P4: I mean, if I'm doing this from home.

129
00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:31.020
P4: I've and I just said I want help.

130
00:11:31.717 --> 00:11:34.589
Moderator: I would expect some kind of pop up to say.

131
00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:44.249
P4: here's a link, or we will provide this. We will provide information to you at your appointment in 2 days, or something.

132
00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:49.499
Moderator: Okay. So, you'd like a follow-up on the questionnaire.

133
00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:50.429
P4: Yeah, I mean.

134
00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:52.680
Moderator: Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead!

135
00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:53.940
P4: No, if that makes sense.

136
00:11:53.940 --> 00:12:05.246
Moderator: Yes, on a scale of one to 5, with one being very easy and 5 being very difficult. How easy or difficult was it to answer these questions.

137
00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:07.620
P4: Easing.

138
00:12:08.704 --> 00:12:10.479
Moderator: So, like 2.

139
00:12:11.535 --> 00:12:12.350
P4: Yes.

140
00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:15.339
Moderator: Okay, yeah, I'm going to ask you to move on.

141
00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:32.710
P4: To ensure. We provide a tailored care that aligns with your health goals. We ask all patients to specify their sexual orientation annually. You have the option to select one or more from the following list.

142
00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:37.029
P4: or, if you prefer, you may choose not to answer.

143
00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:41.609
Moderator: Anything confusing on here or unclear.

144
00:12:42.032 --> 00:12:46.760
P4: No, I mean, it's kind of surprised that the Va. Would care.

145
00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:53.800
P4: I mean, it's 1 thing I mean. Why would you care if I'm straighter

146
00:12:54.100 --> 00:13:06.330
P4: gay, I mean, what you really care about is I using? Am I, you know, doing unprotected sex, or doing having some kind of I don't know. How do you say it? A. You know

147
00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:10.939
P4: dangerous sex history, or whatever you call it? I can't remember. Oh.

148
00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:12.869
P4: yeah, I mean, I think it's

149
00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:16.095
P4: kind of surprising no one has ever asked me.

150
00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:27.510
P4: I feel like this is something from the new Administration to be like, oh, boy, we're getting rid of them out of the veterans. Ranks, too.

151
00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:29.230
P4: I.

152
00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:30.660
Moderator: Okay.

153
00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:36.770
P4: I mean, even like, choose not to answer. That's Oh, my God! That's a red flag! Get P4orth out of the Va. Now.

154
00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:42.559
P4: so, I mean, throw some red flags.

155
00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:46.289
Moderator: Okay, I'm going to ask you to read. Yes, too.

156
00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:48.079
Moderator: Thank you.

157
00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:52.180
Moderator: It was what you expected to happen.

158
00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:53.730
P4: All right.

159
00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:55.350
P4: Expected to

160
00:13:55.610 --> 00:14:03.930
P4: get a big red letter on my scarlet letter on my shirt for saying I was anything other than a straight veteran.

161
00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:07.670
P4: No, I mean, yeah, I'm

162
00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:12.030
P4: I'm not sure what I expected. After that, the last question.

163
00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:13.410
Moderator: Okay.

164
00:14:14.033 --> 00:14:15.280
P4: Thank you.

165
00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:18.370
P4: Yeah.

166
00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:22.920
P4: yeah, that I just I don't know. If I had an option, I'd get rid of that one.

167
00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:24.110
Moderator: Okay.

168
00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:25.889
Moderator: I'll ask you to move on. You.

169
00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:26.610
P4: Okay.

170
00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:34.280
P4: do you smoke? Cigarettes? Do not factor in any other tobacco usage.

171
00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:38.129
P4: including e-cigarettes. I smoke cigarettes every day.

172
00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:42.770
P4: I've used cigarettes in the past but quit and do not currently use them. I've never smoked

173
00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:47.199
P4: where I've smoked fewer than 100 cigarettes in my lifetime. I declined the screen.

174
00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:56.140
P4: I mean, it seems clear. Let me go back and look at the original question. Okay.

175
00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:58.829
P4: the original question is tobacco pack

176
00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:06.620
P4: year history. So, by saying, Pack, you're only talking cigarettes. You're not talking about chewing tobacco

177
00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:14.079
P4: or cigars. I mean, yeah, it seems.

178
00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:19.540
P4: Yeah, it seems relatively straightforward.

179
00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:20.930
Moderator: Okay.

180
00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:27.490
P4: Oh, how long ago did you quit smoking cigarettes? Yeah.

181
00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:30.589
Moderator: Okay, I'll ask you to move. Yeah.

182
00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:33.720
Moderator: So that was what you expected.

183
00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:34.730
P4: Oh.

184
00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:52.499
P4: I mean, if you say you're actually asking these to help my medical needs, it's kind of surprising they didn't talk about chewing tobacco, because that's so prevalent in the military. You know, the lip cancer rate's going to skyrocket in the next 2030 years.

185
00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:58.049
P4: So yeah, I'm kind of surprised. It only talked about cigarettes

186
00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:00.509
P4: when there's so much out there.

187
00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:06.481
Moderator: Were there any terms unfamiliar or confusing.

188
00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:19.280
P4: No, no, no, idols are kind of weird just to

189
00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:24.660
P4: cause. We don't talk about it. You talk about a pack here. But in the questions. It wasn't about a pack.

190
00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:26.859
Moderator: Okay, so that's.

191
00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:33.699
P4: It wasn't about a year. It was. It was just tobacco. It was just a history of cigarette smoking, not tobacco.

192
00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:38.649
P4: So, either expand it to all types of tobacco

193
00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:45.799
P4: and vaping. I guess. Probably right. I don't know what the research shows. But I would say, Yeah, tobacco use history.

194
00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:46.700
Moderator: Okay.

195
00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:57.939
Moderator: all right, thank you for that. And then on a scale of one to 5, 1 being very easy and 5 being very difficult. How easy or difficult it was to answer these questions!

196
00:16:57.940 --> 00:16:58.710
P4: Oh, easy!

197
00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:01.719
Moderator: He's moving on, please.

198
00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:08.859
P4: Sorry toxic exposure as required by the honoring act honoring our Pact Act.

199
00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:29.789
P4: The Va. It is screening all enrolled veterans for potential toxic exposure and offering toxic exposure, screening information at least every 5 years. Possible exposures include airborne hazards and open Burn Pit Gulf war, related exposures, agent Orange radiation, camp LeJune contaminated water exposure. Other exposures.

200
00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:42.120
P4: Participation in this survey is voluntary. If you choose not to enter, it will not change your benefits. It should take less than 5 min. To complete all the information. Confidential survey follows the rules of the Paperwork reduction act

201
00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.946
P4: one B.

202
00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:46.040
P4: Okay.

203
00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:50.999
Moderator: Anything in here that is unclear or unexpected.

204
00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:55.619
P4: No normal. I've done these a few times.

205
00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:57.623
Moderator: Okay, move on, please.

206
00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:04.670
P4: Do you believe that you experience any toxic exposure such as airborne hazards and open burn pit global related exposures.

207
00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:11.080
P4: agent orange radiation contaminated water at Camp Lejeune, or other such exposures.

208
00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:20.401
P4: Yes, no, seems clear. I wonder if I don't know, and yes, or the same. No.

209
00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:29.300
P4: Do you think this kind of repeats the same question, doesn't it?

210
00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:36.310
P4: Oh, do you believe that you were exposed to the following, while serving

211
00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:45.680
P4: in the Armed forces, airborne hazards. Gulf Agent orange.

212
00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:50.169
P4: Okay, you can select multiple things.

213
00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:57.660
Moderator: Okay. So, you mentioned that you believe that this question was essentially a repeat of the 1st one.

214
00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:04.449
P4: Well, yeah, because it says, do you believe it's like, yes, and then it's Do you believe

215
00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:13.990
P4: you know you were exposed? And then which ones I feel like, you know.

216
00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:20.970
P4: I feel like you could combine them and say, if you believe you were exposed to

217
00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:28.359
P4: any hazards you know, select below something like that.

218
00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:35.579
P4: I also feel like it said I don't. If you said I don't know, I feel like it ought to

219
00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:40.340
P4: prompt these to say, you know, where you were anywhere, you know.

220
00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:48.540
P4: So, you know, if you say I don't know, you could have these same questions.

221
00:19:48.730 --> 00:20:07.480
P4: you know, kind of changed right and say, if you don't know if you were exposed, you could say, did you serve in? You know, these areas are from 19 blank to 19 blank where there were open burn pits. You know. Were you in Vietnam

222
00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:11.270
P4: when did Agent Orange happen between these years?

223
00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:21.959
P4: You know where you camp with Zoom between 1956 and 1986. You know those kinds of things, because if you don't know, then you need to prompt them with the actual dates and locations

224
00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:23.660
P4: to help them.

225
00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:25.439
P4: Does that make sense.

226
00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:30.650
Moderator: Yes, absolutely. Yeah. So, you felt like the logic was a little bit off.

227
00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:35.549
P4: Yeah. Cause? Yeah, if you don't know, you're not going to know? Based on these questions.

228
00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:40.201
Moderator: Yeah, that's great feedback. Thank you, [Redacted PII].

229
00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:57.200
P4: There are medical conditions that have been found to be potentially related to airborne hazards and open burn pits exposure. These are called presumptive conditions. If you have any of these conditions, you should file a claim for disability compensation.

230
00:20:57.410 --> 00:21:07.569
P4: additional information will be included in the educational material you will receive today to minimize the long-term impacts of exposures on your health and life. It is important that you are engaged.

231
00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:10.810
P4: Oh, with the beginning no

232
00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:18.140
P4: more related.

233
00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:22.439
P4: It's a lot of reading.

234
00:21:24.398 --> 00:21:26.890
P4: Is this a real website?

235
00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:30.840
Moderator: Yes, it is the va.gov website. Yes.

236
00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:36.860
P4: Yeah. Toxic disclosure screening information.

237
00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:39.390
P4: I mean, I've.

238
00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:43.449
Moderator: What do you think of this page.

239
00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:50.375
P4: I don't know. I mean, most people don't like clicking on more links. They just like I'm just going to page on through. I mean.

240
00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:56.880
P4: So, I think if I was on the last page, if I

241
00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:04.779
P4: you know you're like, Oh, yeah, you may have had this. Now go follow this other link and figure out what to do about it.

242
00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:12.890
P4: I almost feel that this whole preparation for the appointment should be.

243
00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:17.270
P4: Thank you for highlighting this. We will talk. You know we're going to

244
00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:21.120
P4: debrief you more at your appointment in 2 days.

245
00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:29.629
P4: you know, and then you could be provided with a handout or more, based on all of this?

246
00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:39.300
P4: because then, again, this is not going in your medical record by answering these questions that I was in the Gulf War, and I was in Iraq

247
00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:45.179
P4: and then click these burn pit registries and

248
00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:53.040
P4: stuff. I mean, I would think you'd want somebody to actually sit down and explain them to them a little bit more.

249
00:22:53.760 --> 00:23:00.600
Moderator: Okay. So, what do you think of the links being on there?

250
00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:11.319
P4: I think the links are nice, I mean, but I don't think most people would do it. You're just like a dude. I'm just taking the survey here to get to the appointment. 2 days. I'm just clicking.

251
00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:12.410
Moderator: But.

252
00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:15.670
P4: But I think, go ahead.

253
00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:19.779
Moderator: So, you're saying that most people won't click on them or.

254
00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:25.470
P4: I would not think so. They're just doing this preparation to get to the appointment in 2 days.

255
00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:26.020
Moderator: Okay.

256
00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:29.841
P4: I think the key is to have the provider follow up with

257
00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:36.260
P4: what you know because you logged in. So, it's going to show your responses.

258
00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:41.889
P4: You can have the links. But say, your provider will follow up with you at your appointment.

259
00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:47.689
Moderator: Okay, let me ask you to continue.

260
00:23:58.354 --> 00:24:00.550
P4: Is that supposed to be loading that long.

261
00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:10.063
Moderator: So. So, what do you? What would you do next if you were at home doing this.

262
00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:13.929
P4: I just clicked that button, and it's just sitting there.

263
00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:15.740
P4: Oh, what would I do?

264
00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:17.470
Moderator: That's quote. Oh.

265
00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:22.019
P4: I mean I would hit backwards and then forwards and hit, refresh.

266
00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:22.835
Moderator: Okay.

267
00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:29.201
P4: And then I eventually just quit, and I'll go to the appointment 2 days.

268
00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:32.893
Moderator: Okay, so show me what you'd actually do.

269
00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:36.470
P4: I would hit, refresh.

270
00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:38.140
Moderator: Okay.

271
00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:42.499
P4: And then I have to start all over again. What was it? 3, 1545.

272
00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:49.380
Moderator: 3, 9, 1945. So, what do you think about getting the screen after the refresh.

273
00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:54.859
P4: Then I'd be, was this voluntary? Because if it's just voluntary, I'm not going to do it anymore.

274
00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:59.109
Moderator: Okay. So, if you were at home you wouldn't know.

275
00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:00.320
P4: Not at all.

276
00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:00.784
Moderator: Needed.

277
00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:01.850
P4: No.

278
00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:03.160
Moderator: Okay.

279
00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:11.049
P4: No, we get these things all you know. You get these requests for feedback after every appointment, and things like that.

280
00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:15.180
P4: Oh.

281
00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:24.000
P4: so, I hit continue. Oh, okay.

282
00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:26.290
Moderator: So, after this.

283
00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:33.899
Moderator: the after you are frozen there with the loading screen. What do you think happened to those questions?

284
00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:35.440
P4: It reloaded them.

285
00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:45.135
Moderator: Okay. So, when you say it, it loaded them. Can you be more specific in what you think

286
00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:49.349
Moderator: happen to them after they reloaded.

287
00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:56.070
P4: I just signed back in, and I could see them see it

288
00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:01.600
P4: right.

289
00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:02.050
Moderator: Yes.

290
00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:04.150
P4: Yeah, see, they're already there.

291
00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:05.340
Moderator: Okay.

292
00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:09.980
P4: So, I could tell that they were reloaded. So, I was happy with that.

293
00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:11.034
Moderator: Okay.

294
00:26:17.197 --> 00:26:20.319
P4: The second one was just about Gulf war exposures.

295
00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:24.429
P4: So, the 1st one was airborne hazards and open burn pits.

296
00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:27.319
P4: I mean, I would have added.

297
00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:40.748
P4: I would like before it mentioned something about 1990, but I would have been more specific, you know. Exposure, you know, during service, and wherever Haiti Somalia.

298
00:26:41.659 --> 00:26:59.409
Moderator: Okay. So, [Redacted PII], now I'm going to keep you on here, and we're going to talk about your overall impression of the prototype about, you know, keeping aside the actual questions, what's your impression of just using this prototype?

299
00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:06.606
P4: I mean

300
00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:20.680
P4: I don't know what I mean. I see what I mean, the system

301
00:27:21.398 --> 00:27:23.789
P4: Work. I don't know the

302
00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:33.119
P4: I don't know if they are you asking about them. Are the 4 questions at the beginning that all lead into this going to lead to the outcome? What you desire

303
00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:33.900
P4: that.

304
00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:44.879
Moderator: It could be. But mostly I'm just Con, I'm just looking for your feedback on actually like using the software.

305
00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:45.620
Moderator: Actually.

306
00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:50.110
P4: Yeah, I mean, if it comes in, it's if it comes in and says,

307
00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:56.249
P4: you know, confirm your appointment. Are you familiar with how it's done now with texting.

308
00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:06.889
Moderator: Yes, but this so I should have mentioned that sometimes the Va. Will you send me these questionnaires

309
00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:13.640
Moderator: randomly, like on an intermittent basis, even though you don't have a healthcare appointment.

310
00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:18.920
P4: Oh, okay. So those I probably just delete them. So, if you are actually.

311
00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:19.706
Moderator: Answer them.

312
00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:21.521
P4: Yeah, if you

313
00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:34.719
P4: right now, to schedule you get the text and say you have an appointment next Monday, hit by 1 or into to keep it. I've never had a Perigean

314
00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:40.810
P4: appointment survey. I get post appointments and surveys all the time.

315
00:28:43.575 --> 00:28:49.699
P4: but I think I mean, this is good for new veterans

316
00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:57.840
P4: who may not know. You know about these, you know airborne toxins and burn fits and stuff, and also good for

317
00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:12.150
P4: I guess older veterans that all of a sudden get symptoms later on in their life. And they're like, Oh, my God! You know I was, you know, breathing burn pits for 6 months. And now I have these symptoms.

318
00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:20.959
P4: So, I mean, I like it. I'm trying to think of a forcing function to make people

319
00:29:21.390 --> 00:29:22.460
P4: do it

320
00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:32.601
P4: right, and that's and if you tie it to the appointment and say, Please conduct this Perigean appointment survey. I mean, I think that'd be better off.

321
00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:36.180
P4: you'd get more results out of it.

322
00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:42.769
P4: you know. I think there could be a lot more. I mean a lot more different questions, too. I mean, you need to, you know.

323
00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:45.430
P4: can't have it go for 6 h. So, I get that.

324
00:29:45.840 --> 00:30:10.480
Moderator: Sure. So, let's say that the Va is going to implement Perigean appointment questions, how do you feel about using this actual software to answer future questions like on a on a particular cadence. Would you like to use it? Would you dislike using it? How do you feel about the actual moving through the questionnaire and

325
00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:12.140
Moderator: just the way the.

326
00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:19.730
P4: Yeah, it works fine. You know, I'd have to see how it works on a phone, because since most people use the phone, make sure it's mobile.

327
00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:21.930
P4: you know, capable.

328
00:30:22.390 --> 00:30:32.230
Moderator: How does this prototype compare to other software or prototypes that you've used to answer surveys or questionnaires that are digital.

329
00:30:34.596 --> 00:30:42.700
P4: I think it's the same, you know. It looks a little clunky by listing the exact website

330
00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:50.140
P4: Http, as opposed to click here and explain what this link shows. You.

331
00:30:50.290 --> 00:31:16.170
P4: Click here for this link, you know, or if you want to apply for benefits, right? I mean, you know, like the last one is. It says benefits in that. Pdf, but it doesn't say, you know. Click here and bring this to your appointment, you know, or fill out this survey for burn pits and bring to your point whatever. I wouldn't list the whole web address. That seems a little clunky and doesn't really explain what those.

332
00:31:17.790 --> 00:31:26.869
Moderator: What's your opinion on be, you know, clicking on these links and being sent to the Va website.

333
00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:45.080
P4: I think that's fine here on a laptop, because it's easy to toggle back and forth between screens. If you have me, do that on the phone. I couldn't jump between tabs very quickly. I don't know. People can, but I'm terrible at it. I don't think it would work well

334
00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:46.650
P4: on my phone.

335
00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:52.800
Moderator: So, if you could change one thing about this experience

336
00:31:53.710 --> 00:32:03.569
Moderator: again, not considering the questions themselves, but just the experience of the prototype. Change one thing. What would that be?

337
00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:06.620
P4: More Explanations.

338
00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:09.430
Moderator: Give me more specific.

339
00:32:09.877 --> 00:32:14.350
P4: Explanations of what the links do and explanations of the

340
00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:22.689
P4: different diagnoses to see if I actually, if you're talking to me with this Gulf war exposure.

341
00:32:22.890 --> 00:32:29.289
P4: You know, it was either in 1975 or 2025, you know, it's different.

342
00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:39.049
Moderator: All right. That's all. That's all I have. [Redacted PII], do you have any questions for me before we go.

343
00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:41.539
P4: No, that was good. I liked it. Thank you.

344
00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:46.225
Moderator: Thank you. I'm just going to ask Chantelle if she has any questions.

345
00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:48.749
Notetaker: I do not.

346
00:32:49.370 --> 00:33:06.110
Moderator: Thank you. So again, [Redacted PII], thank you so much for participating in this session for us before you go. I just want to reiterate that this wasn't real, and none of this answering this questionnaire will affect your real health care.

347
00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:07.610
P4: Oh, no issue!

348
00:33:08.182 --> 00:33:24.949
Moderator: And Perigean, is going to be sending you a thank you. Note with a little blurb for you to pass along to other veterans, that you may know that May possibly would like to participate in sessions like this again. Thank you again.

349
00:33:25.150 --> 00:33:26.150
P4: Thank you very much.

350
00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:28.350
P4: Bye-bye.
