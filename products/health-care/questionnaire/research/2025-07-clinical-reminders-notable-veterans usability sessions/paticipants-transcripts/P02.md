00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:10.039
Moderator: Great. So now that we're on the recording, just one more time to confirm. Are you comfortable with me, recording my screen and the audio. As we talk today.

2
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:10.890
{Redacted PII]: Yes.

3
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:29.459
Moderator: Perfect. So now that's all out of the way. A couple intro questions. Have you ever filled out health questionnaires that you've received from the Va. Provider, either during your appointment or through like an email or text.

4
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.710
{Redacted PII]: Yes.

5
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.509
Moderator: Okay. Could you tell me more.

6
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:45.269
{Redacted PII]: From Standard Pre OP. Stuff. Some of the stuff was questionnaires with regards to medication.

7
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.470
{Redacted PII]: that kind of thing. Nothing big.

8
00:00:49.241 --> 00:00:54.230
Moderator: Some of the other standard stuff that they do could be done ahead of time, but.

9
00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.700
{Redacted PII]: That's another issue.

10
00:00:58.621 --> 00:01:06.580
Moderator: have you ever filled these out? Via email, or text, or only in person.

11
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:11.290
{Redacted PII]: Email.

12
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.763
Moderator: Oh, okay. Could you tell me more about

13
00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.960
{Redacted PII]: Well, you know what? No, they don't do it. Well, there's no such thing as email in the Va.

14
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:28.359
{Redacted PII]: so that doesn't work. That's why I say no, because secure messaging is not

15
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.769
{Redacted PII]: via my healthy vet is not email.

16
00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.739
Moderator: Oh, okay. But have you filled these out online before an appointment.

17
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.920
{Redacted PII]: I think so.

18
00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.099
Moderator: Okay. Do you remember at all what that experience was like?

19
00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.320
{Redacted PII]: Pretty pedestrian.

20
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.970
Moderator: Okay.

21
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:56.690
Moderator: cool. Good to know. Well, today, we're going to pretend that your doctor emailed you some health questionnaires for you to complete before your upcoming appointment?

22
00:01:57.506 --> 00:02:04.789
Moderator: And so some of these questions will be familiar to you. You probably answered them before. Some {Redacted PII] seem new.

23
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.219
Moderator: and I'm going to have you as you read each screen, just think out loud. Tell me what you think about it.

24
00:02:11.805 --> 00:02:21.819
Moderator: And just a reminder that these answers aren't going to affect you or your benefits in any way? What device are you using right now.

25
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.520
Moderator: like a phone or computer?

26
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.080
{Redacted PII]: No, we tried a phone last time. No, I'm on a laptop.

27
00:02:28.812 --> 00:02:37.359
Moderator: Okay, awesome. And now I'm going to send you in the chat a link to the prototype.

28
00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.849
Moderator: But no need to click it yet.

29
00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:53.090
Moderator: First.st I'm gonna have you share your screen. So there should be a little green arrow at the bottom of your zoom.

30
00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.926
Moderator: and perfect.

31
00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.060
Moderator: Now.

32
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:05.510
Moderator: Hmm!

33
00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:12.660
Moderator: Now, if you can open up the link that I just sent you in the chat.

34
00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.220
Moderator: This looks a little unfamiliar to me.

35
00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.720
Moderator: Oh, okay, but you're seeing it fine.

36
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:34.729
Moderator: And then in the chat also, there's like a fake username and password. Could you fill those in

37
00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.309
Moderator: awesome? And before you click, sign in.

38
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.110
Moderator: Would you mind sharing just your 1st impressions after opening the link.

39
00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:56.350
{Redacted PII]: Fine.

40
00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.780
Moderator: Okay, and similarly, here

41
00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:19.050
Moderator: and on all of the following screens, I'd like you to think out loud. Tell me what you think of the page before you click anything, because we're really interested in hearing what you think of the questionnaire platform. Specifically the for{Redacted PII]ting

42
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:30.900
Moderator: and how the questions are laid out like the interaction and the logic. And we're less focused on the questions themselves and the wording.

43
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:37.188
{Redacted PII]: Sure. No, these are pretty standard on when you go. This is what I was talking about having done ahead of time. So the

44
00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.497
{Redacted PII]: nurse, practitioner, or whatever doesn't have to do this stuff. So

45
00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.339
{Redacted PII]: veterans are used to this, I think it should be more linear, meaning.

46
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.240
{Redacted PII]: I'm looking at it visually going 1, 2, 3, 4.

47
00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:54.900
{Redacted PII]: I don't think

48
00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:02.739
{Redacted PII]: you want me to start in random orders. I think we're so used to linear that it should be.

49
00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:08.520
{Redacted PII]: We need to ask a few questions. Nobody asked 4 questions at the same time.

50
00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.340
{Redacted PII]: So if it's a conversation, it should be a conversation.

51
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.840
{Redacted PII]: If we're gonna ask questions, start the questions, okay, but know what?

52
00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:27.820
{Redacted PII]: We know, what? It should almost say. These are the standard questions you get asked before

53
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.320
{Redacted PII]: every visit with a Pcp. So why don't we just go over.

54
00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:35.650
Moderator: And.

55
00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:37.490
{Redacted PII]: In a conversational {Redacted PII].

56
00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.029
Moderator: Okay. And so then what would you expect the next page to be.

57
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:49.600
{Redacted PII]: Next page. No, clean up this page and say, Hey, it should be.

58
00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.569
{Redacted PII]: We're gonna ask a few standard questions that you're kind of used to by now

59
00:05:54.850 --> 00:06:08.334
{Redacted PII]: and then the next one should be, how are you doing with homeless food, insecurity screen? Not screen. Just how are you doing with this, then ask the questions just like a conversation that you'd be having with the

60
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.120
{Redacted PII]: with a nurse.

61
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:11.360
Moderator: Yes.

62
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.820
{Redacted PII]: This is, this is extra.

63
00:06:14.497 --> 00:06:15.720
Moderator: That's good feedback.

64
00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.770
{Redacted PII]: Okay, and I'll probably have to. Well, go ahead.

65
00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:25.560
Moderator: Oh, I was just gonna say, that's great feedback and if there's nothing else on this page we can move on to the next screen.

66
00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.160
{Redacted PII]: Yep.

67
00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.150
Moderator: Awesome. So go ahead.

68
00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:30.499
{Redacted PII]: Go ahead! What.

69
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:35.240
Moderator: Oh, if you saw this page, what would you do next?

70
00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:37.909
{Redacted PII]: So he, the.

71
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:54.304
Moderator: And just again, before you move forward. Could you tell me what you thought about the screen?

72
00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:56.850
{Redacted PII]: Is standard.

73
00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:00.609
{Redacted PII]: I don't think I've ever been able to decline it, though.

74
00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:03.369
Moderator: Oh, and how do you feel about that.

75
00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:06.780
{Redacted PII]: I think it's a great option.

76
00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:12.939
{Redacted PII]: Just so, you know a nurse will just keep badgering you until she gets an answer from you.

77
00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.720
Moderator: Could you tell me more? Have you experienced that.

78
00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:22.610
{Redacted PII]: Yeah, I've never been able to say to deny the question.

79
00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:24.890
Moderator: Okay.

80
00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:28.290
Moderator: So sorry.

81
00:07:28.537 --> 00:07:30.020
{Redacted PII]: Can I go back on? Yeah.

82
00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:33.449
Moderator: Oh, how did you go back.

83
00:07:35.484 --> 00:07:36.899
{Redacted PII]: Button on my mouse.

84
00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:43.359
Moderator: Oh, I've never used this with the mouse before. That's good to know.

85
00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:50.589
{Redacted PII]: Ensure. We provide tailored care that aligns with your health goals. We ask all patients to specifically

86
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:54.419
{Redacted PII]: to specify their sexual orientation annually.

87
00:07:54.620 --> 00:08:00.880
{Redacted PII]: You have the option to select one or more of the following, or, if you prefer, you may choose not to answer.

88
00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:03.140
{Redacted PII]: Okay.

89
00:08:03.522 --> 00:08:05.050
Moderator: Yeah, any thoughts here.

90
00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:16.749
{Redacted PII]: No, I just hate the topic because you guys

91
00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:22.880
{Redacted PII]: want somebody to be honest, and then you'll punish them for it later.

92
00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:23.890
{Redacted PII]: So.

93
00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:34.199
Moderator: Same thing. Could you? Tell me what you think of the screen before you move on.

94
00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:03.630
{Redacted PII]: Okay.

95
00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:09.070
Moderator: Sorry

96
00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:15.410
Moderator: again before you go to the next screen. I'd love to hear just what you think of the page.

97
00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:18.450
{Redacted PII]: Okay?

98
00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:27.230
{Redacted PII]: well, this is just being

99
00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:35.149
{Redacted PII]: so. This right here is too much verbiage.

100
00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:39.089
{Redacted PII]: If it's threefold, it should just say 3 things.

101
00:09:40.944 --> 00:09:44.670
Moderator: Okay, that's good. Feedback.

102
00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:46.190
Moderator: Thank you.

103
00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:53.009
{Redacted PII]: I said. I've been able to live in stable housing that you own rent or stay in as part of a household.

104
00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:59.680
{Redacted PII]: This is pretty much not gonna change. This is your standard. How you have to ask the question.

105
00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:07.100
{Redacted PII]: are you worried concerned that in the next 2 months may have not have stable housing that you own.

106
00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:12.219
{Redacted PII]: Yeah, let's just do that. Okay, where have you lived? Most

107
00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:18.210
{Redacted PII]: lived for most of the past 2 months?

108
00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:24.640
{Redacted PII]: That sentence is not gram{Redacted PII]ically correct that question. So

109
00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:30.110
{Redacted PII]: you guys are horrible on who wrote the question. It's not even gram{Redacted PII]ically correct.

110
00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:31.870
{Redacted PII]: Anyway.

111
00:10:32.214 --> 00:10:34.279
Moderator: I did not write the questions.

112
00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.069
{Redacted PII]: Oh! And everybody.

113
00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:35.460
Moderator: Standard.

114
00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:38.151
{Redacted PII]: You're just the you're the facilitator.

115
00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:41.580
{Redacted PII]: Did you have?

116
00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.189
{Redacted PII]: Well, let's see if it does. Stuff.

117
00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:04.480
Moderator: Cool.

118
00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:06.479
{Redacted PII]: Like to refer to

119
00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:21.359
{Redacted PII]: again. That's not gram{Redacted PII]ically correct, man, you guys are horrible.

120
00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:26.190
Moderator: Yeah, or.

121
00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:39.890
{Redacted PII]: Okay, so here, if I get an error screen like this because it says, Hey, I would like to re like a referral to a social

122
00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.139
{Redacted PII]: to social work.

123
00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:43.930
{Redacted PII]: Okay?

124
00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:44.450
Moderator: Is it.

125
00:11:46.525 --> 00:11:51.159
{Redacted PII]: If this is a required screen, and there's only

126
00:11:51.430 --> 00:12:00.959
{Redacted PII]: 2 ways or 3 ways, or however many ways that there are for you to get in touch with this person. Then you should have lockdown

127
00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:09.599
{Redacted PII]: phone number or lockdown email address in order to move forward.

128
00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:17.180
{Redacted PII]: Do you know what I'm talking about in a database or in web ease, user experience, that it's

129
00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:23.019
{Redacted PII]: a 10 digit number or a email with an at sign in it.

130
00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:30.530
{Redacted PII]: What other way do you want? Do you think they're going to reach me? I shouldn't have to say, what's the best way to reach you? Do you want to be reached via email or phone number.

131
00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:38.120
Moderator: Okay. So you're saying, instead of this big text box, there should just be like a phone number box or an email box.

132
00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:47.830
{Redacted PII]: And if this is linked into any other database, it should be propagated with instantly with my preferred email and my preferred number already.

133
00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:50.140
Moderator: Yes. Yeah.

134
00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:59.369
{Redacted PII]: So it should be. A look should be a lookup table, and the lookup table should just be a click and shoot and say, I want email and go.

135
00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:06.480
Moderator: Yeah, yeah, that's good feedback, and then, before you move on, sorry.

136
00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:09.380
Moderator: Could you tell me what's wrong about the grammar?

137
00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:11.579
Moderator: I don't think.

138
00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:12.949
{Redacted PII]: Refer to a talk.

139
00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:18.610
{Redacted PII]: a person.

140
00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:24.160
Moderator: I see. I see. Okay, that's helpful. Okay.

141
00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:26.260
Moderator: we can move on. Thank you.

142
00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:29.309
{Redacted PII]: You wanna know what was wrong with the other one, too.

143
00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:33.144
Moderator: Yes, please. I'm just zooming through it. So I

144
00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.139
{Redacted PII]: I don't know where it was, anyway. Let's do this one.

145
00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:39.850
{Redacted PII]: Woo.

146
00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:45.049
{Redacted PII]: What was this one? This one right here?

147
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:47.240
{Redacted PII]: Wow.

148
00:13:55.740 --> 00:14:02.289
{Redacted PII]: okay, you're gonna find I'm jaded on this one because I went through the procedure over a year ago to try to

149
00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:17.819
{Redacted PII]: reassess stuff. It got stagnated with a 3rd party vendor, and they have not contacted me since and not moved the ball forward. So by you guys putting all this verbiage up here on stuff the vets probably already know.

150
00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:22.359
{Redacted PII]: I'm just wondering how you clean it up, though.

151
00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:27.670
Moderator: Yeah, what would you prefer to see here?

152
00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:34.810
{Redacted PII]: So when you have these kind of screens, if you chunk it up or do stuff that's like.

153
00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:48.940
{Redacted PII]: I'm sure there are ways for you to make this more condensed with regards to hot links

154
00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:56.680
{Redacted PII]: or things that can be compliant

155
00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:08.349
{Redacted PII]: and not be this much screen. Because here's 1 of the things you you guys have done so far broke one of the rules of you should never have to scroll down to hit a continue button.

156
00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:10.110
Moderator: Hmm.

157
00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:13.859
{Redacted PII]: So you're already visually on my screen

158
00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:17.199
{Redacted PII]: wasting real estate. See this area right here.

159
00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:22.749
{Redacted PII]: You gotta get rid of that or this in order for me to see the continue button.

160
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:24.680
Moderator: Yeah.

161
00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:26.679
{Redacted PII]: That's just ux.

162
00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:29.690
{Redacted PII]: Okay.

163
00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:30.630
Moderator: Yes.

164
00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:52.459
{Redacted PII]: Just like before. What happens if I say yes to any of these.

165
00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:57.000
Moderator: What do you think should happen.

166
00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:01.020
{Redacted PII]: Somebody should reach out to me.

167
00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:03.479
Moderator: Yeah, that's fair.

168
00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:10.340
{Redacted PII]: Okay, this probably isn't there?

169
00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:11.740
{Redacted PII]: Normally.

170
00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:13.630
{Redacted PII]: Okay.

171
00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.669
{Redacted PII]: But you know what? That's not what happened.

172
00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:21.230
{Redacted PII]: Okay, so here, I check these boxes

173
00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.579
{Redacted PII]: and nobody's calling, gonna contact me.

174
00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:28.670
{Redacted PII]: All you're doing is motherhood. And putting up these 800 numbers.

175
00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:30.390
Moderator: Yeah, what would you?

176
00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:31.000
{Redacted PII]: For my.

177
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:31.340
Moderator: Yeah.

178
00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:32.959
{Redacted PII]: For me to do more work.

179
00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:44.329
{Redacted PII]: Okay. The Va. Is very good on making me do more work in order to keep the ball moving down the street

180
00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:57.690
{Redacted PII]: or my healthcare forever progressing. It's not proactive in the other way around. This should have been somebody calling me on these 3 these 4 things instead, I can tell right now that you want me to

181
00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:04.488
{Redacted PII]: call these 800 numbers. If I have any issues with these things, I could have done that today.

182
00:17:04.849 --> 00:17:05.569
Moderator: Yeah.

183
00:17:05.569 --> 00:17:07.669
{Redacted PII]: Doesn't do anything for me.

184
00:17:07.969 --> 00:17:10.760
{Redacted PII]: This is what I would call motherhood.

185
00:17:12.369 --> 00:17:20.319
{Redacted PII]: When somebody, when somebody in a in a questionnaire does all of this, and goes through this whole thing like.

186
00:17:21.639 --> 00:17:24.979
{Redacted PII]: what was any of this going to do

187
00:17:26.039 --> 00:17:29.149
{Redacted PII]: for me by answering this questionnaire?

188
00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:35.729
Moderator: Yeah, so just to make, sure, I'm understanding you.

189
00:17:36.266 --> 00:17:42.069
Moderator: After you select those you would want someone, you'd want it to say, something like

190
00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:46.339
Moderator: someone is going to call you about these things. You checked.

191
00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.290
Moderator: and then they just call you whenever.

192
00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:52.229
{Redacted PII]: Well, I mean.

193
00:17:52.700 --> 00:18:01.739
{Redacted PII]: it's kind of interesting where you talk about homelessness, or we're trying to do these 3 things right. We're focused on these 3 things.

194
00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:04.939
{Redacted PII]: and I go through and say, Okay, how focused are you

195
00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:09.629
{Redacted PII]: if I say this stuff right? And I continue.

196
00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:22.330
{Redacted PII]: what happens.

197
00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:27.090
Moderator: Yeah, so.

198
00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:28.349
Moderator: Oh, I think you.

199
00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:31.559
{Redacted PII]: It's nice that you get. The Va. Does this for compliance.

200
00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:42.159
{Redacted PII]: but never once with me answering these questions, or bringing up stuff about mental health or anything like that. There's something proactively happen from the Va.

201
00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:45.060
{Redacted PII]: To me. It's always like.

202
00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:51.759
{Redacted PII]: well, if you haven't heard from us by 2 weeks from now. You should probably call us back.

203
00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:57.800
Moderator: Yeah, yeah, that's good to know.

204
00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:01.609
{Redacted PII]: Otherwise, this is a compliance issue.

205
00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:05.959
{Redacted PII]: This is me doing. This is me doing your work.

206
00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:09.910
Moderator: Yes, yeah, that's good feedback.

207
00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:18.049
{Redacted PII]: That's why I was saying, it's motherhood. When you're saying, Are you concerned about this? Do you have any other questions? I do.

208
00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:20.979
{Redacted PII]: But then, when I have the questions.

209
00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:23.440
{Redacted PII]: question is, I have a question.

210
00:19:24.583 --> 00:19:25.309
Moderator: It does.

211
00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:30.479
{Redacted PII]: I didn't get to ask the question I got presented with an 800 number.

212
00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:36.150
Moderator: Yes, yeah, yeah. That makes sense.

213
00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:56.479
Moderator: So in the scenario where you're filling this out right before an appointment with your Pcp, would you still want to receive a call, or would you be fine with it? Saying, Okay, we'll make sure that this is covered in your next appointment.

214
00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:57.960
{Redacted PII]: Oh, that's fine, too.

215
00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:02.620
Moderator: Okay. As long as they say that they're gonna do something with what you just filled out.

216
00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:03.730
{Redacted PII]: Right.

217
00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:05.000
Moderator: Okay.

218
00:20:06.233 --> 00:20:17.490
Moderator: that makes sense. And then, you're all done with the questionnaires. And so I do have a few more questions just about the overall experience. But do you have

219
00:20:18.075 --> 00:20:21.910
Moderator: anything else you want to say before I have you stop sharing screen

220
00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:24.040
Moderator: anything you want to point out.

221
00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:29.110
{Redacted PII]: I guess you're the biggest thing I I have a thing that is, if this is.

222
00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:33.880
{Redacted PII]: I don't know how you're going to get this to the vet.

223
00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:36.700
Moderator: Oh, could you say more.

224
00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:39.769
{Redacted PII]: You said email.

225
00:20:43.680 --> 00:21:03.550
Moderator: yeah, it could go through. I don't. I don't know exactly what the plans are, it could go through my healthy, vet, I think we're mostly concerned right now with just the actual platform, this form interface, and then we'll figure out what avenue makes the most sense. Oh, are you frozen.

226
00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:06.230
{Redacted PII]: You're no, you're probably gonna get shut down with that.

227
00:21:07.281 --> 00:21:08.740
Moderator: Can you tell me more.

228
00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:17.419
{Redacted PII]: So my healthy vet has a caveat that it's not email.

229
00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:21.779
{Redacted PII]: Not even secure messaging. And it's not

230
00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:32.429
{Redacted PII]: it. It's not accurate, it's not

231
00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:38.929
{Redacted PII]: dialogue, and it has the caveat of saying we get to take up to 3 days.

232
00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:47.110
{Redacted PII]: and then we get to take up to 3 days to give you response of Oh, I sent it to your doc.

233
00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:54.649
{Redacted PII]: and it was somebody that was just screening the emails or the it's not email secure messaging.

234
00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:57.910
{Redacted PII]: And then that Doc then has

235
00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:00.379
{Redacted PII]: a week to get back to me.

236
00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:05.559
{Redacted PII]: and then I've recently had it where the doc never got back to me.

237
00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:13.110
{Redacted PII]: So if you're saying my healthy vet and secure messaging, I'll just tell you right now. That is not a viable

238
00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:14.440
{Redacted PII]: system.

239
00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:17.209
Moderator: Because things get lost.

240
00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:22.290
{Redacted PII]: No, the it's not lost, it's

241
00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:26.859
{Redacted PII]: it's not a 3 days, is not a timely

242
00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:31.510
{Redacted PII]: response. 3 days is not email.

243
00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:36.220
Moderator: Yeah, what is a timely response for you?

244
00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:46.910
{Redacted PII]: Well, my business is 4 h, but I wouldn't expect that for so what happens in the Va is when you have somebody that screens this stuff.

245
00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:47.980
Moderator: This is.

246
00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:48.690
{Redacted PII]: Right.

247
00:22:49.250 --> 00:23:00.039
{Redacted PII]: But in this case it's not a screen. It's a questionnaire that goes into my, okay, let's how about this? What? What time, what timeliness do you think it should be prior to my appointment?

248
00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:04.449
{Redacted PII]: You're gonna have to put that out there. Please fill this out

249
00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:08.190
{Redacted PII]: 3 days or 4 days before your appointment.

250
00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:18.969
Moderator: yeah, it does that seem appropriate to you?

251
00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:25.830
{Redacted PII]: So most veterans are pretty compliant when it comes to this kind of stuff.

252
00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:26.710
Moderator: This one.

253
00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:47.600
{Redacted PII]: Once you get them in a system, they trust the system, they know it's not gonna bite them. They know that it's actually going to do something for them, and they get them to do it. Just say, Hey, look! We're trying to do this, so we don't have to. We can speed up the process. When you get here. We don't have to ask you these stupid questions, and if there is anything that's come up we can address it proactively.

254
00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:48.450
Moderator: Yeah.

255
00:23:49.780 --> 00:24:02.329
{Redacted PII]: You gotta do that in a timely manner of 3 days or 4 days, or with your text messaging. So I get a text message that says, Hey, you've got an appointment this Thursday at 2 o'clock.

256
00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:03.909
{Redacted PII]: Do you know how?

257
00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:10.920
{Redacted PII]: It's not how dumb that is? But it literally says, say yes. 37.

258
00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:14.769
{Redacted PII]: To say that you're going to confirm your appointment?

259
00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:21.030
{Redacted PII]: N. 24. To cancel your appointment? D. 37. For more infor{Redacted PII]ion.

260
00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:27.830
{Redacted PII]: Why is it that every single time I have to hit more infor{Redacted PII]ion.

261
00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:39.769
{Redacted PII]: because I don't know which appointment it's for, is it for sleep? Is it for my Pcp. Is it a new one that just got put in? Is it one that's a video call that wants to go over just

262
00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:41.680
{Redacted PII]: my lab results.

263
00:24:42.385 --> 00:24:48.789
{Redacted PII]: So yeah, I. I can see where. If you guys go into that auto{Redacted PII]ed system with a link

264
00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:56.000
{Redacted PII]: that says, Hey, prior to your appointment.

265
00:24:56.970 --> 00:25:05.959
{Redacted PII]: help us speed up the process and answer these standard questions ahead of time with that same system.

266
00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:12.660
{Redacted PII]: What I'm saying is, use a system that's already effective and timely.

267
00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:24.359
{Redacted PII]: not one trying to push the square peg in a round hole and say, Oh, let's use secure messaging where you know that it's already limited, and already has loopholes that

268
00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:29.460
{Redacted PII]: things get dropped and lost, let alone integrated with Cprs.

269
00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:30.770
Moderator: Yeah.

270
00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:47.220
Moderator: Okay. So just to make sure I understand what you're saying, you're saying for delivering this questionnaire. You want it to be through a method where, you know, you'll get like a timely response, so like text as opposed to my healthy vet.

271
00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:58.400
{Redacted PII]: I, let's put it this way, if you want this to be effective and you want it to actually do what it's supposed to do. It's gonna have to be delivered in a timely manner.

272
00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:03.369
{Redacted PII]: because I don't think your system is going to be auto{Redacted PII]ed enough for me to do in the parking lot.

273
00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:06.100
{Redacted PII]: Prior to my appointment.

274
00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:08.450
Moderator: Yeah, yeah.

275
00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:16.220
{Redacted PII]: Now that's an ideal world. I don't see why you can't dream the dream of having that happen.

276
00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:21.010
Moderator: Yes. But you're just assuming, that

277
00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:22.780
Moderator: will be delay after you, submit it.

278
00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:26.970
{Redacted PII]: So one of the things is dreaming the dream of saying, that's the ideal scenario.

279
00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:38.880
{Redacted PII]: I should be able to do it 15 min before my appointment auto{Redacted PII]edly links into Cprs. And I sit down with a Doc. Bang. It's there. Okay. Now.

280
00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:52.579
{Redacted PII]: I've had experiences in the past with programming stuff within the Va. That getting permissions and having the programmer wag the dog's tail and tell you you can't, you can't, you can't

281
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:55.750
{Redacted PII]: right instead of you saying.

282
00:26:56.010 --> 00:27:02.159
{Redacted PII]: I don't care. Make it happen. This is what my goal is. My goal is 15 min

283
00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:04.150
{Redacted PII]: prior to the appointment.

284
00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:08.670
{Redacted PII]: Auto{Redacted PII]ed hooks into Cprs and don't

285
00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:24.320
{Redacted PII]: and and stop dumbing it down, that the back says I can't do hooks into that without permissions, because things like blue dot have already solved a lot of hipaa and Va. Problems with hooks.

286
00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:25.690
Moderator: Hmm.

287
00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:29.720
{Redacted PII]: Okay, they did that 8, almost 10 years ago.

288
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.070
{Redacted PII]: So

289
00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:41.620
{Redacted PII]: that company I forget where they're out of out of California. They did like every app does where they say, if you want to give us permission.

290
00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:48.799
{Redacted PII]: deny it 9 times on the app, make sure you give us your credit card and make sure you

291
00:27:48.910 --> 00:27:52.440
{Redacted PII]: do this. So we can make sure this app works.

292
00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:56.547
Moderator: Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.

293
00:27:57.470 --> 00:28:07.389
Moderator: okay, cool. Well, I do have a few more questions to ask, and I want to make sure we don't go over time so if you could stop sharing your screen, we can just go to

294
00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:09.329
Moderator: go back to Zoom.

295
00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:13.580
{Redacted PII]: Stop sharing.

296
00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:15.870
{Redacted PII]: Oh, there we go! Stop sharing.

297
00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:26.629
Moderator: Okay, thank you. And so your answers to some of these {Redacted PII] overlap with what we've already talked about, which is okay. So just

298
00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:36.220
Moderator: back to that demo tool. What we're really trying to understand is the experience of navigating that interface.

299
00:28:36.873 --> 00:28:39.140
Moderator: So you mentioned some ux

300
00:28:39.917 --> 00:28:52.309
Moderator: and that is the kind of feedback we're really looking into, and less so about. The actual wording of like this is, this part was too wordy, or

301
00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:55.743
Moderator: we know the grammar is wrong, but

302
00:28:56.530 --> 00:28:57.950
{Redacted PII]: Use more colors done.

303
00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:08.269
Moderator: Yeah, we're less focused on that, more focused on the the interaction and the logic. So can you tell me about your overall impression of the prototype.

304
00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:19.339
{Redacted PII]: I think it was.

305
00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:30.190
{Redacted PII]: I wouldn't say it's gonna be harsh, but it seems like it was developed in the fax machine era.

306
00:29:31.705 --> 00:29:34.270
Moderator: Can you share more? Why.

307
00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:39.029
{Redacted PII]: I mean, you literally just did sentences, and

308
00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:42.079
{Redacted PII]: sometimes you even hit the continued button.

309
00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:52.350
Moderator: And how does that compare to like other questionnaire platforms you've used or what you'd want to see.

310
00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:09.360
{Redacted PII]: Use more standard web questionnaire development. I don't know what

311
00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:13.760
{Redacted PII]: I mean. It's like nobody read the book.

312
00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:16.860
Moderator: Hmm!

313
00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:30.640
Moderator: I'm not a hundred percent sure what you think of as standard, because, you know, everybody has slightly different ideas of what's normal. Could you share an example

314
00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:32.610
Moderator: of what you mean?

315
00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:45.729
{Redacted PII]: No, I think you need to move on the next question. If it

316
00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:52.460
{Redacted PII]: if if visually, you're doing black and white sentences in a font. That's

317
00:30:53.430 --> 00:31:02.139
{Redacted PII]: I wouldn't say the easiest to read or condensed, not condensed. But it's kind of that kind of thing.

318
00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:08.820
Moderator: Yeah, so you're saying, you want it to look more like visually modern polished.

319
00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:09.450
{Redacted PII]: Yeah.

320
00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:14.090
Moderator: Okay, that makes sense. And

321
00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:21.159
Moderator: was there anything? That didn't {Redacted PII]ch what you expected to happen.

322
00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:29.160
{Redacted PII]: I will take them. I will be done with this in a minute.

323
00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:31.600
{Redacted PII]: Okay, I will.

324
00:31:32.892 --> 00:31:35.880
{Redacted PII]: Trying to determine who's taking the dog out. So.

325
00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:36.520
Moderator: Okay.

326
00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:37.360
{Redacted PII]: My job.

327
00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:39.609
Moderator: Yes, it should just be like.

328
00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:39.930
{Redacted PII]: That's correct.

329
00:31:39.930 --> 00:31:41.738
Moderator: 10 min! Oh! Hi!

330
00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:43.250
{Redacted PII]: 10 min.

331
00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:44.160
Moderator: Yes.

332
00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:45.273
{Redacted PII]: 10 min.

333
00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:49.595
{Redacted PII]: Okay.

334
00:31:51.622 --> 00:32:00.880
Moderator: Yeah. So just as you were going through the questionnaire was there anything that didn't work as expected or didn't {Redacted PII]ch what you thought would happen.

335
00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:04.169
{Redacted PII]: Oh, not that we've already covered.

336
00:32:04.930 --> 00:32:15.439
Moderator: Okay, and if you were, for example, filling this out, and then you needed to take the dog out and return later, what would you expect to happen like on your screen.

337
00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:21.359
{Redacted PII]: Well, that's a

338
00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:33.700
{Redacted PII]: again a security issue and a functionality of the timing out that it would be nice to just be able to come back and hit, and to hit a link that says, Oh, verify who you are again, or quickly get back into it. But

339
00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:36.410
{Redacted PII]: I know that would probably not happen.

340
00:32:38.254 --> 00:32:40.259
Moderator: Why would it probably not happen.

341
00:32:40.770 --> 00:32:43.119
{Redacted PII]: Because your time out and security issues.

342
00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:44.310
Moderator: Okay?

343
00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:50.090
Moderator: So then the the next best case is you can sign right back in.

344
00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:51.270
{Redacted PII]: Yes.

345
00:32:51.410 --> 00:32:52.060
Moderator: Okay.

346
00:32:52.670 --> 00:33:03.579
Moderator: cool. How did you feel about using this type of platform for answering personal health questions? Did it feel like safe and secure with your infor{Redacted PII]ion?

347
00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:09.290
{Redacted PII]: Until proven, otherwise.

348
00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:16.720
Moderator: Okay, and then what do you think about the length of time to complete the experience.

349
00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:20.830
{Redacted PII]: Oh, if I can just blaze through it!

350
00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:23.150
{Redacted PII]: I'm fine with it.

351
00:33:23.510 --> 00:33:37.469
Moderator: Okay, yeah. So like, if you had to interact with this prototype to answer questions about your healthcare on a particular consistent basis, how satisfied or dissatisfied. Would you be.

352
00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:44.370
{Redacted PII]: Meaning. Could I go through it faster on the next one? Yeah.

353
00:33:44.370 --> 00:33:45.440
Moderator: Yeah, sure.

354
00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:54.990
Moderator: So if you could answer with like very dissatisfied, dissatisfied, satisfied, very satisfied. Where would you be.

355
00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:59.830
{Redacted PII]: Well, the thing is, are you gonna keep the car, keep it the same right.

356
00:34:01.563 --> 00:34:07.230
Moderator: Let's say the questions {Redacted PII] change, but it always be the same interface.

357
00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:08.199
{Redacted PII]: Sure.

358
00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:20.550
{Redacted PII]: Familiarity speed. It's like going to give blood at the Red Cross, and they have this stack of questions that they ask you. But you know that they're gonna change one of the questions every time.

359
00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:21.820
Moderator: Hmm.

360
00:34:22.250 --> 00:34:25.739
{Redacted PII]: Part of me wants to play the game. Of which question did they change this time?

361
00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:34.429
{Redacted PII]: But the other part of me says, I just want to do the pre screening of these 65 questions and get on with the pre screening

362
00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:45.400
{Redacted PII]: cause for me. If I know that this isn't for me, and this is just a compliance thing for you.

363
00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:50.810
{Redacted PII]: I'm just like when I go to visit the nurse, and she goes through the whole. Ask these questions.

364
00:34:50.969 --> 00:34:53.720
{Redacted PII]: or he asked me all the questions.

365
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:59.460
{Redacted PII]: if it's just a compliance for you and not for me, I'm going to speed through them as fast as I can.

366
00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:01.969
Moderator: Yeah, yeah, just to get it done.

367
00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:03.389
{Redacted PII]: To get it done.

368
00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:13.559
Moderator: Yeah, that makes sense. Okay. And then if you could change one thing about the entire questionnaire experience, what would it be.

369
00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:21.999
{Redacted PII]: How about one button.

370
00:35:23.490 --> 00:35:26.930
Moderator: Oh, could you share more what that'd be like?

371
00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:33.000
{Redacted PII]: Has anything changed since the last time we asked you these questions?

372
00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:35.989
{Redacted PII]: Oh, yes, no.

373
00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:37.590
Moderator: Hmm!

374
00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:39.640
Moderator: That makes sense.

375
00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:43.720
{Redacted PII]: If I have never use tobacco.

376
00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:46.959
{Redacted PII]: why do you keep asking me?

377
00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:55.430
{Redacted PII]: Do you think that I'm all of a sudden gonna start using, or can you just say, has anything changed since the last time you've seen your Pcp.

378
00:35:57.352 --> 00:36:00.330
Moderator: In these 4 categories that you already know.

379
00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:02.920
{Redacted PII]: You've been asked these over and over.

380
00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.430
Moderator: Yes, that makes sense.

381
00:36:09.370 --> 00:36:14.159
Moderator: And then, before we finish up, do you have any questions for me?

382
00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:16.220
{Redacted PII]: Nope.

383
00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:24.560
Moderator: Awesome. And then I'm also going to ask the observers. Do any of you have questions.

384
00:36:27.297 --> 00:36:36.639
Observer 2: Hi, this is Observer 2. I am a project manager. I didn't get a chance to introduce myself earlier, but just wanted to say, Thanks a lot for taking the time to to speak with us and giving us your feedback.

385
00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:38.210
{Redacted PII]: You're welcome.

386
00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:45.679
Observer 1: Yep, I was going to reiterate what Observer 2 said. So thanks. Is Observer 1Thank you again.

387
00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:47.329
Observer 1: learning all the infor{Redacted PII]ion.

388
00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:56.410
Moderator: Okay. Well, if there are no further questions, I know you have to walk the dog, and so.

389
00:36:56.410 --> 00:36:56.840
{Redacted PII]: Okay.

390
00:36:56.870 --> 00:37:10.579
Moderator: Thank you so much for taking the time to chat with us today. Your feedback is really so helpful to us as we're trying to make sure these experience really work for veterans, and I just wanted to reiterate again

391
00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:30.129
Moderator: everything we did today wasn't real, so it won't we won't submit your answers to your provider. And lastly, Perigean's going to send you a thank you. Note, and it'll include a blurb that you can pass along to other veterans, you may know, in case they also want to participate in a future research study.

392
00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:31.570
{Redacted PII]: That'd be great.

393
00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:37.169
Moderator: Awesome. Yeah. So thank you so much for taking the time to chat and have a nice day.
