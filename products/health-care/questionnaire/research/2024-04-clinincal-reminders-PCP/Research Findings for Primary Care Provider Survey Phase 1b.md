# Research Findings for Health Questionnaire, Clinical Reminders Primary Care Provider Survey Phase 1b, April, 2024
The volume of clinical reminders has been impacting the quality of the time the patient spends with the provider. Providers have also reported increased burden due to data entry and notification fatigue. Therefore, Veteran Health Administration (VHA) is in search of a tool that allows customizable and standardized health forms, screeners, and questionnaires to be sent to the patient to collect responses asynchronously. Through an earlier evaluation, it was identified that VA already has two digital questionnaire tools within our ecosystem, Behavioral Health Labs (BHL) and eScreening, that can meet many, but not all our process and technological needs. OCC, OCTO, and VHA program offices agreed to complete a pilot to gather more insight to compare the tools. This study will collect Veteran feedback on the tools.

## How this research maps to the Veteran journey
- Taking care of myself
- Putting down roots
- Retiring
- Aging
   <br> 
 <br>
 
## Research goals
This study collected data using a survey questionnaire that was emailed to a VA primary care providers to get feedback on whether the clinical reminders health questionnaire pilot yielded noticeable improvements to the following:

- Improved the quality of the time providers spend with patients during the healthcare appointments.

- Reduced provider notification fatigue.

- Reduced provider burnout.

- Maintained an appropriate level of safety and clinical integrity?
   <br> 
 <br>
 
## Hypothesis
- The tool will reduce overall clinical reminder burden for providers, including data entry and notification fatigue.​

- Providers will perceive digital questionnaires to be a safe way to gather this information from Veterans.

## Method

### Recruitment
Pilot location participants were asked to volunteer to provide anonymous feedback at the start the pilot.
   <br> 
 <br>
 
### Dates of Survey
There were 3 separate communications inviting participants to respond to the survey due to low participation after the first 2 sent. Participants were emailed survey participation correspondence on two separate occasions along with a link to the Typeform survey;
The last correspondece and Typeform link was sent via MS Teams chat direct messaging. Most respondents filled out the survey after the invitation was sent out via MC Teams.

- 1st invite: April 15th, 2024; response requested by April 24th, 2024​

- 2nd invite: April 29, 2024; response requested by ​May 1, 2024 

- 3rd invite: May 2, 2024; response requested by ​May 6, 2024 
   <br> 
 <br>
 
### Participants 
- 8 PCPs were invited take part in the survey and 5 responded. 
    - Butler, PA: 3
    - Minneapolis, MS: 5​
   <br>

### Survey questions​

    - Likert multiple choice ​
    - Yes/no questions​​

## Key findings

**Finding 1:** 1 out 5 participants observed a somewhat improvement in the quality of time spent with Veterans during the pilot dates. In addition, the participant did notice that their workflow was somewhat positively changed and believed the screener provided value for their clinic, upheld clinical integrity, and maintained a level of safety for Veterans.
  

**Finding 2:** Even though 4 out of 5 participants responded that they were not aware of the pilot occurring at their facility, or that they hadn't noticed a change in the quality of time spent with patients, we belive this evidences that the screeners did not cause a disruption or delay in the PCP's workflow; the insights gathered from this survey can serve as a bolster for evidence that the clinical reminder screeners will not add undue burden on staff and PCPs; however, additional research is needed.

 <br>
      
## Recommendations
We recommend that phase 2 encompasses interviews with providers who participate in the pilot. The goal of the PCP interviews is to gather feedback on whether the questionnaire platform chosen for phase 2 decreased physician burnout and improved the quality of time spent with patient.
