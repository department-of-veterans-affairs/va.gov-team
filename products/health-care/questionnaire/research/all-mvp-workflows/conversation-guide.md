## Project-specific setup and Intro - 10 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Kristen and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to review prototypes of a questionnaire that will help you and your doctor prepare for an upcoming appointment.

**If desktop participant**
- **Since this is a prototype, not everything will be clickable or fully functioning.**
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve our tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **This entire session should take about an hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- Talk them through Zoom screen sharing and chat features shown in document.
- [Screen share and walk through this document if necessary](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lo44N4rTBDaHfcsjX6bCV1a--YJSTPXSXnZbywB71J0/edit?usp=sharing)


**If mobile participant**

- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve our tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **This entire session should take about an hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- First I want to make sure your technology is ready to go for this session. Can you confirm for me what type of device you're using to join today?
    -Great, that helps me troubleshoot with you if we run into any problems.
    
_For iPhone:_
- OK great. When you are inside the zoom application on your phone, you'll see a few buttons at the bottom. Audio, Video, Share content, Participants, and three dots over to the right. If you tap on those dots, you'll also see a function called "Chat". If you don't tap the screen for a while, the icons at the bottom will hide. You can tap anywhere on the screen to get them to show. The ones that will be important for us today are "chat" and "share content." Any questions?
- Tap ‘Share content’ (Green button at bottom middle of the screen)
- Tap on Screen
- Tap Zoom
- Tap start broadcast. After a count of 3, the entire device screen will be shared into the meeting
- Tap the red bar at the top of your screen when you are ready to end the share
- Great, now I can see your phone screen! I'm going to begin now if that's ok with you. We will return to this in a few moments.
_For troubleshooting screen sharing in iOS, reference the Zoom documentation here https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115005890803-iOS-Screen-Sharing_

_For Android:_
- OK great. When you are inside the zoom application on your phone, you'll see a few buttons at the bottom. For instance, Share and three dots over to the right. If you tap on those dots, you'll also see a function called "Chat". If you don't tap the screen for a while, the icons at the bottom will hide. You can tap anywhere on the screen to get them to show. The ones that will be important for us today are "chat" and "share." Any questions?
- Tap "Share"
- Tap "Screen"
- May give a "sensitive info" alert
- May ask you to give Zoom permission to display over other apps, toggle yes. The hit the back arrow . Then it might just share your screen.
- Tap "Start now" (maybe)

**Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:**

- Ok, it seems like we're having some trouble getting the prototype up on your screen. I'm really excited for you to participate though, so what we're going to do today is have me share my screen, and then I'm going to have you "Drive". You will tell me what to do, what to tap, on, etc. Does that sound ok?
- [Share your screen]. Can you confirm if you can see my screen?

**Recording Instructions**

- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?"** 

Great. Now we're really ready to begin!

## Warm-up Questions - 3 minutes
Think about your last primary care provider visit at the VA. 	
- Did your appointment experience differ at all from past experiences due to COVID? If so, how?	
- What was the experience prior to the appointment like? For example, did you have to fill out any forms before the appointment? Did the nurse ask you a lot of questions?

## Questionnaire Scenarios - 30 minutes

Keep that pre-appointment experience in mind through the next series of scenarios that we are going to discuss.	I'm going to send you a link in the chat.

[Mobile Prototype](https://preview.uxpin.com/d3c9bb8ac5052d077234b5e4b2f7749d0bc5200d#/pages/134593965?mode=cvhidm)<br/>
- Show three mobile participants the scenarios in the following order: 1 (text), then 2.
- Show three mobile participants the scenarios in the following order: 2, then 1 (text).

[Desktop Prototype](https://preview.uxpin.com/db0b9ece7c8e0983a8baf1971db406af9f1d2201#/pages/134600037?mode=cvhidm)<br/>
- Show three desktop participants the scenarios in the following order: 1 (email), then 2.
- Show three desktop participants the scenarios in the following order: 2, then 1 (email).

### Scenario 1 - 15 minutes
Don’t click on anything yet. Just read the notification. 
- What are your impressions of this notification?
	- If not mentioned, what do you think about entering Y1 and N1?
		- What would you prefer to enter instead?
- Why do you believe that you would have been sent this notification?
- How many days in advance of your appointment would you want to receive this notification?
- Would you be interested in receiving this notification multiple times? 
	- yes, two reminders are good.
	- only if you didn’t respond to the first notification.
- What are the actions that you could take immediately based upon the (email or text) that you just received?

Now, please fill out the questionnaire that your provider has requested you complete. For this questionnaire, your name will be Hector Allen and you have an upcoming primary care appointment for your annual physical. Please narrate your thoughts as you complete the task.
- _Things to watch/listen for:_
	- _Did the Veteran successfully complete the task. Success = getting to the screen with the "Your questionnaire has been sent to your provider." alert box._
	- _Pay attention to Veteran commentary on confusing or pleasing portions of the task._
	- _Take note of anything the Veteran suggests to add._

Next, we are going to go back to the beginning of the questionnaire, so I can ask a few questions about each page.

On the Introduction page, take some time now to review this page.
- What are your impressions of this page?
- What are your thoughts about the information provided?
- Is there any other information we should include here?
	
On the This Visit page...
- What if you decide that you want to take some more time to think about questions for you provider? How could you save what you already entered, then come back and finish the form?

On the confirmation page, 
- What are your impressions of this page?
- Which of the buttons on the page would you most likely be interested in viewing next? 
	- Would you prefer to navigate anywhere else instead?
- When (if at all) would you view and print questions? When (if at all) would you print this PDF?

Remember when we talked about saving your in-progress questionnaire answers. Pretend that you are returning to the form the next day after saving your current work and you lost the notification (email or text), where on va.gov would you look first to find this questionnaire? (Pick one.)
- I would use the search.
- I would navigate to a list of my appointments and expect a questionnaire link to appear in the details of my appointment.
- I would log in and expect to see a link on my dashboard to the questionnaires that I need to complete.
- I would use the main menu on va.gov to navigate to a health questionnaire section. _(If the participant selects this, make them pick their second option.)_

### Scenario 2 - 15 minutes
Now, you found the main health questionnaires section on va.gov...(ask while displaying the marketing/Drupal page)
- What are your impressions of this page?
- What are your thoughts about the information provided?
- How valuable is the information on this page to you?
- Is there any other information that we should include on this page?

Have the participant click to the Questionnaire list (To do tab)
- What are your impressions of this page?
- Can you tell me what you think the difference is between the cards shown on the screen?
	- Ask about button wording if the difference isn't clear. 
- What are your thoughts about the information provided?
- How valuable is the information on this page to you?
- Is there any other information that we should include on this page?

Your primary care provider just sent you a pre-visit questionnaire. Before you fill it out, you want to review your responses to your last primary care questionnaire. Find your last questionnaire and review your responses. Please narrate your thoughts as you complete the task.
- _Things to watch/listen for:_
	- _Did the Veteran successfully complete the task. Success = click on the “View and print questions.”_
	- _Pay attention to Veteran commentary on confusing or pleasing portions of the task._
	- _Take note of anything the Veteran suggests to add._
- How easy or hard was it to find the completed questionnaire?

Click on the “View and print questions” button, what are your impressions of this PDF?
- When (if at all) would you view this PDF? When (if at all) would you print this PDF?
- Would you want any additional information added to this PDF?

_Have the participant go back to the Questionnaire list (completed tab)_
- What are your impressions of this page?
- Can you tell me what you think the difference is between the cards shown on the screen?
	- If clarification is needed, ask about their interest in seeing appointments that were canceled, but where you started to answer questions.
		-If applicable, what about if we displayed "You can access your in-progress answers for the next X days?"
- What are your thoughts about the information provided?
- How valuable is the information on this page to you?
- Is this location where you would expect to come back to and see this list of completed questionnaires?
- Is there any other information that we should include on this page?- Would you want to see questionnaire responses over time?
	- When?
	- What if the questionnaire resulted in a score? Would you be interested in seeing your score over time?
