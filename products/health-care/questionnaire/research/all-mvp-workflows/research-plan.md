# Research Plan for All "Primary care questionnaire" MVP Workflows Research Dec. 2020 

## Goals	
This research is to usability test desktop and mobile prototype versions of the primary care appointment questionnaire design and gain feedback on all the workflows in and out of the questionnaire.

**Background**<br/>
Our goal is to improve the in-person and online pre- and post-appointment experiences for Veterans, contribute to physical distancing efforts in VA facilities, and better integrate Veteran-provided data in VA workflows by providing Veterans with a digital option to complete pre- or post-appointment questionnaires and screeners. Our MVP will focus on improving the pre-appointment experience when visiting primary care providers.

**Research questions**
- Are Veterans able to successfully find and complete the new, in-progress, and completed questionnaire via text or e-mail?
- Are Veterans able to navigate to a meaningful location after completing the questionnaire?
- Is there any confusion caused by the content or question wording within any of the workflows?

**Hypothesis & assumptions**
- Veterans will be able to successfully find and complete the questionnaire.
- Veterans will be able to navigate to a meaningful location after completing the questionnaire.
- There will be minimal confusion created by the content and question wording within any of the workflows. 

## Method	
We will conduct remote moderated usability testing via Zoom using the Perigean contract. This method will allow us to share a high-fidelity wireframe prototype (mobile and desktop versions) to confirm if our questionnaire is easily usable by Veterans.

## Participants and Recruitment

Recruit for 12 fulfilled sessions (6 for the desktop version and 6 for the mobile version of the test) using the following criteria:

**Must have for participants**
- Have you visted a primary care provider at the VA in the last year? (pass = yes)
	- If confused by the term "primary care provider," explain that a primary care provider is your main doctor, nurse practitioner, or physicianâ€™s assistant.
- At least two people with an identified cognitive consideration of PTSD or TBI (one for the mobile test and one for desktop test)

**Good to have for participants**
- At least 1 woman
- At least 1 person of color
- At least 1 participant 35 or under and 1 participant over 55
- At least one person that does not have a college degree (to include enlisted Vets)
- At least one person that has a college degree (to include of officer Vets)
- At least one person who lives in a rural or remote area
- At least one person who lives in a major metropolitan area
- At least one person with a disability rating of 70% or greater

**Recruitment requirements**
- Half (6) must have a mobile device and be willing to be complete the test on said device
	- Half of the mobile test participants (3) taking the test on an iOS mobile device
	- Half of the mobile test participants (3) taking the test on an Android mobile device
- Half (6) must have a laptop/desktop and be willing to be complete the test on said laptop/desktop
- The participants have Zoom downloaded prior to the session
- The participants know how to screenshare

*This study requires participants to screenshare, in order to click through a prototype. It will not be able to accommodate non-sighted users due to the prototype technology.*
