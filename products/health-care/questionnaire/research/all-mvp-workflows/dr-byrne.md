# Notes from Dr.Byrne meeting to review MVP end to end workflow

## Demo
- Dr. B doesn't work for Loma Linda Medical center  and now works for VA central office
	- Dr. B is currently seeing patients 1 day per week at Loma Linda clinic
	- Next step after pilot is to get in touch with Informatics team to determine how to move past pilot to others at Loma Linda

- List loop questions- usabiliy of user having to select remove or add another question when they are done.
	- AB let Dr. B know that its in our design review now for enhancement coming soon. Kristen to followup for when this will be available. 

- Meds req is being used on Pre-visit summary  at Loma Linda today and is a big push for the organization.
- Dr. B wanted to know how does this work for the overall patient portal experience (secure messaging and bigger picture) f
	-  we let him know we are transitioning the long term on va.gov
- Dr. B thinks the notification text/email should go to Veterans within 1 week of the appointment. changes to med status could happen if you go earlier. 
	- Consider the night before or morning of to finish the questionnaire. Due to if printed then night before is bettter but once we move to all digital the Dr. can pull up on computer and no need for printed PVS once we get all info that is currently on PVS in the pre-visit questionnaire. 
- Once Dr. B reviews the PVS he will print to CPRS after provider confirms.  
- Pre-visit and After visit and note tying all the workflow together - need to think about how the workflow and these 3 documentation can help each other for future enhancements as the data on each can feed the next. 
-  We will circle back with Sharon and Dr B when we know concrete timing for pilot can be started 


## Medications
- Dr. B/Rob stated that printing with color printer is an issue when trying to show medication images on AVS
- Question if we are getting the medication images from the National Repository **Medication Imaging Library** which contains the image of med and description (stored in CDW??- They tried to show the image on AVS). 
- Typically meds are taking as prescribed but studies show that adherence goes down when a medication is taken multiple times a day
-  Use verbiage for taking as prescribed to match the verbiage on PVS
	- Consider adding Unsure option for a choice in Medication adherence as patients should be given the option to say the do not know.  
	- include facility/ prescriber/ status - currently on drill in view. 
- Medication Reconcile Directive- required to reconcile Active meds, discontinued, expired, over the counter and meds receiving from outside the VA. 
- Ideas is to pull Allergies into the Previsit summary as its all part of the meds rec initiative
- 5-10 meds is typical per patient med list. 

## Immunizzation.
- Covid Vac - clinical reminder is capturing covid - if they have it done elsewhere and it can be entered in the clinical reminder and then it shows in the immunization list in vista
- don't require documentation and just take the patient verbal saying they got the shot.
