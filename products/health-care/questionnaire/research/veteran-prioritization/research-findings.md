# Healthcare Experience Initiative Prioritization Research Findings

**Prepared by:** Aricka Lewis (aricka@adhocteam.us)<br>
August 2020

## Goal
The purpose of this study was to gain Veteran input on which healthcare questionnaires to prioritize for our team.

## Methodology
We conducted 8 moderated card sort sessions with Veterans. After the sort, we showed a sample "Reason for visit" questionnaire for initial feedback.

### Who we talked with
- 8 Veterans
- Representative of ages 35 to 75+

## High level findings
- We are heading in the right direction with the "Reason for visit" questionnaire.
- 7 out of 8 Veterans sorted the "Top concerns/goal for visit" card into the "fill out ahead of time" category.
- Veterans used the "unsure/not applicable" category when questions didn't apply to them or when they assumed the VA would already have the information.
- Veterans assume that the VA has their background information.
- Veterans assumed that the text fields on the mockup were related. 

## Details of findings

**We are heading in the right direction with the "Reason for visit" questionnaire.** <br> All Veterans received the mockup well and stated that having a simple form to relay the goal for their visit was helpful. There is a general excitement for the opportunity to complete forms ahead of time.  

**7 out of 8 Veterans sorted the "Top concerns/goal for visit" card into the "fill out ahead of time" category.**<br> A majority of Veterans stated that filling out a reason for visit questionnaire before their appointment would be beneficial for a few reasons. Including:
- Save time while waiting in lobby before appointment
- Communicating what issues they are facing through writing instead of verbally
- Optimize time with provider to talk about important information/issues

**Veterans used the "unsure/not applicable" category when questions didn't apply to them or when they assumed the VA would already have the information.** <br> Veterans that stated sorted topics like "alcohol use" "tobacco use" and "suicide/depression)" stated that those issues do not affect them. Additionally, Veterans that were affected by these topics were split between either wanting to fill them out ahead of their appointment or dicuss them in person.

**Veterans assume that the VA has their background information.** <br> They stated that the VA should know information related to family medical history, social history, past medical history, or any fields that may not change often. Multiple participants mentioned that they would rather update this information if it changed instead of filling it out before every visit.

Opportunities:
- We should gain an understanding of what questions are time sensitive or should be asked each visit (e.g. suicide/depression or physical activity)
- Explore the idea of a "health profile" with the option to edit background information

**Veterans assumed that the text fields on the mockup were related.** The intention of the second text box was to give Veterans the opportunity to document what other isues or life events may be affecting them, regardless of what they listed in the first box. Most Veterans assumed that the second text box was meant to be a space to elaborate on the reason listed in the first box.  

Opoprtunity: create visual separation between the two boxes to better illustrate their intention

## Actionable Recommendations
- Consider pre-populating known background information on forms<br> Examples:
  - Family medical history
  - Tobacco and alcohol use
  - Veteran bio
 
- Explore a logged-in medical profile experience
  - How might we centralize all known Veteran health information?
  - Editable information that gets sent to provider
  
- Consider time-sensitive experiences for sensitive questions
  - Day of updates for suicide/depression
  
- Create visual separation between the reason for visit text fields
