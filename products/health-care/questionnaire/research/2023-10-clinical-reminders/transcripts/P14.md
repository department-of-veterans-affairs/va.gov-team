# Participant 14 eScreening Heath Questionnaire Veteran Pilot

Notetaker: Jenny Wang

## First Task: Notifications - 10 minutes 
M: Prior to your appointment, did you answer questions online to help your provider prepare for your appointment?

P14: Yes

M: How were you notified, such as a text or email, that your provider wanted you to answer some questions prior to your appointment?

P14: In the past, they gave you a clipboard. They started doing it via email. I might have gotten it once via text, but don't remember the specifics of the text. "You go an upcoming appointment" - a week, a day before. As far as texting, I get a ton of them, not remembering forms/questionnaires. 

M: How far in advance of your appointment did you receive this notification? 
  
P14: At least a couple of days. I don't think it was longer. 

M: Do you feel that you were given enough time or not enough time to answer the questions prior to your appointment? 

P14: Enough time, but not all questions make sense. They don't gear towards individuals, very general. I think that's silly. I can't think of them. I think "Really?". They are not necessary or useful. But, when I see providers, they thank me. They are so broad. I'd say 1 or 2 out of 7 or 8 questions make sense.

M: So, after taking those questions and you believe that they're so broad and some of them don't make sense, what do you think happens to these questions?
  
P14: They go somewhere. In the VA system and they probably have some clerks. Inputting them into a database.

M: So, would that make you feel better about taking these questionnaires if they were truly tailored to your specific situation?

P14: Yes.

M: Would you want to receive this notification at a different time prior to your appointment than you did, such as earlier to later? Why? 

P14: Not necessary. I'm retired, so I'm not busy. I did feel pressured when I was given the clipboard. I like to receive them in advance to give a more meaningful response. 

M: Was there anything about the notification that is unclear? 

P14: Not at all.

M: Would you add, delete, or change about the content within the notification?

P14: Why did they give the URL? What's the purpose of that? It's clear it's a questionnaire. It's not clear that it's telling me to a website. 

M: What would you like to see? 

P14: Change the wording - it wasn't clear what I was supposed to do. 
    
M: How much time do you estimate it took you to complete the questions after clicking on the [text or email]?

P14: Well, based on what. Well, I remember from previous ones. You know, you could do them in a minute or 2. But if they want meaningful responses, then you're gonna need you know, maybe 5, 6, 8, 10 min. But then you can't get it just before you go in there. You have to get it several days before. Probably right after they notify me. That I have an appointment coming up. So let's say, let's say our appointments on Wednesday. I would like to see it a day or 2 later. Probably 2 days. But 3 or 4 days, 5 days before. So that if I can't do it right away, I still have a couple of days to complete it.

## Second Task: Complete the clinical reminders - 20 minutes 

M: Next, pretend that you are answering the pre-appointment questions again. We also call these clinical reminders, so you may hear me refer to them as such. Some of the questions will be familiar to you as you answered them before your appointment, while others may not. Please think a loud as you review the screens. I’ll ask you a few questions as you move though too.

Instruction page 

M: Okay, if, if you were, on a scale of one to 5 with one being very easy to understand or read. In 5 being very difficult. What would you read it?

P14: Oh, it's a one.

Demographics and Social Information 

Question 1

M: Okay, if, if you were, on a scale of one to 5 with one being very easy to understand or read. In 5 being very difficult. What would you read it?

P14: Oh, it's a one.

Question 2

M: Okay, if, if you were, on a scale of one to 5 with one being very easy to understand or read. In 5 being very difficult. What would you read it?

P14: For you, it's a one.

Question 3

M: Okay, if, if you were, on a scale of one to 5 with one being very easy to understand or read. In 5 being very difficult. What would you read it?

P14: Does this apply to Vietnam vets? I had Throid cancer. So when I signed up For VA medical coverage, it was rejected. Then, they made it presumptive - Thyroid issues. So this question, it looks like it's only for the Gulf War. I would click yes because I had that claim. 

Question 4

P14: See, there's nothing about Vietnam. So, Agent Orange, I guess I would click on. If I was doing this on my own, I wouldn't know. Health medical questions, benefits claims questions. Health care enrollment, not eligibility questions. Registry questions. What does that mean? No questions at this time.

M: So which do you want to know what all of these means? Or just certain one of them?

P14: Just about all of them. 

M: Okay, if, if you were, on a scale of one to 5 with one being very easy to understand or read. In 5 being very difficult. What would you read it?

P14: 5

Service History question

M: Okay, if, if you were, on a scale of one to 5 with one being very easy to understand or read. In 5 being very difficult. What would you read it?

P14: 1

P14: 1

Thank you page 

M: Okay, if, if you were, on a scale of one to 5 with one being very easy to understand or read. In 5 being very difficult. What would you read it?

P14: (After reading this page) I don't need a summary of this. I know where to go. This is too much information. They are asking you lots of things. It's overwhelming. 

M: What would you leave and take out? 

P14: The primary care part is important. They have resources to address employment, education, or housing. That's important to somebody that just gets out. Do you see what I'm saying? But for someone like me. Applying for the VA. And community benefits. Why is that even in there? Why would they be on this screen? Resources for marriage, family, and spirituality concerns. I think some of these things are necessary. I'm not saying they're not important. What I'm saying is I think that's too much to be asking someone. Who's doing this? But initially. By the way, we offer 15 other things. I rate this a 5. 

- [At the end of all the clinical reminders] 

M: What do you expect to happen next, since you answered these questions?

P14: Nothing. (laughing) Who would contact me? It's not related to my health. I think it's too generalized.  

M: If you could change one thing about this question experience, what would that be?

P14: The flow is not bad, probably the content. Makes it clear. To the vets who try to do it, it's overwhelming. For me, this is okay because I'm in the system and I have done this. There are lots of topics. They ask some things, but not others. But I can tell you that I look at that marriage family spirituality, drinking, and drug use. Feeling said depressed and anxious. Visual impairments. How about hearing impairments? Where do they have that there? 

## Post-Task Interview - 10 minutes 

### Ask these questions if they never filled out a questionnaire before

M: Would answering the questions on your own time impact your responses compared to answering them with your provider? If so, how?

P14: Probably not. I don't see how they could go through. One or 2 things, 3 things that I wanna address with my primary. When I get there I look at it. Before she comes in. But they don't have a lot of time. And I don't find fault with them. Because they have limited They have to see so many events in a day. And so many vets in the week and they've got whatever paperwork. How could you possibly use them? To screen all this and then address it during your appointment.

M: Were the number of questions you answered online today: 

P14: Too many 

M: What would you estimate the ideal number of minutes or question sets to complete at one time prior to one appointment? 

P14: 10-15 mins is fine. 

M: And lastly, do you have any questions for me? 

P14: Be more meaningful, okay? I agree with all that. It's just that. They put so many questions in there. Because They want all this information covered. But. I'll be honest with you, you know, I'm an educated man. Several college degrees and all that stuff. But this stuff bores me. May not bore everyone, but it bores me.
