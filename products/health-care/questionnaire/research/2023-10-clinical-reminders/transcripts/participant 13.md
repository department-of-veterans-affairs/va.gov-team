Introduction / Background
  - Participant received questions prior to health appointment
  - Received via phone call a few weeks prior
    - Questions on suicide ideation and eating disorders
  - Questions were pretty short and manageable
  - The notification / questions came at a good time 

Demo - Email request for questionnaire
  - The sign up for secure messaging sentence was unclear, many at VA won’t know what secure messaging is
  - Time estimate is 20 minutes, thinks that’s a reasonable amount of time
  - Would prefer to do this kind of thing online for speed and ease
  - The quality of the appointment after answering pre-questions is higher, more in depth  

Demo - Link to questionnaire  
  - Welcome Page
    - Doesn’t say how to contact the care team. A phone number or directions for secure messaging would be great
    - Rating: 1
  - Sexual Orientation
    - Reaction: sensitive question, would want assurance that it isn’t shared beyond provider  
    - Rating: 2
      - You have an older generation that isn’t familiar with these terms  
      - Maybe instead of sexual orientation, participant suggests asking whether you’re attracted to men, women, both…etc.  
  - Stable Housing
    - Straightforward, no notes or confusion 
    - Rating: 1 
  - Worry about housing situation 
    - Not sure about the wording 
      - May want to see it address homelessness specifically 
    - Rating: 1 
  - Food Situation  
    - Consistent wording  
      - Last 12 mo / Past 12 mo  
    - Rating: 2 
  - Ran out of Food in last 12 mo  
    - No confusion, no opinions 
    - Rating: 1 
  - PACT Act Reminder  
    - Should include other chemical exposures / be more comprehensive  
    - “Other exposures” is too vague 
    - Rating: 3 
  - Voluntary Survey Participation Disclosure 
    - The email address shown is far too long and complex 
    - Rating: 1 
  - PACT Act / Exposure question  
    - Again, not a comprehensive enough list of exposures 
    - Rating: 2 
  - Follow-up Questions 
    - Participant doesn’t know what registry questions are  
    - Rating: 2

    - Rating: 1 

- Takeaways 
  - Biggest thing: clarification on terms  
  - Overall survey rating: 2 
  - Would expect the appointment to go better after taking this kind of survey  
    - More precise care instead of having to go through many questions getting to root problems 
  - Answering questions on one’s own time allows patient to take their time and think hard about answers, versus answering on the spot  
  - Would like this questionnaire a few weeks / 10 days out from appt  
    - Sometimes they just don’t feel like doing a survey so giving the patient time will allow for completion  
  - Ideal time is 15-20 minutes, 10-15 questions
