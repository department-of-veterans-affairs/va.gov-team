## Intro - 5 minutes 

  

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Kristen] and we have our notetaker on for taking notes. 

I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...  

  

Today we're going to talk about your experience receiving a text or email, then answering health questions online. These questions helped your primary care provider prepare for your recent medical appointment. 

  

Before we start, a few things I want to mention: 

  

- **This entire session should take about [an hour].** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic. 

- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. 

- **You'll be interacting with a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may look and function like the live site but since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA healthcare.

- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**  

- Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I want to be sure before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?** 

   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom. 

   - If yes: Admit observers.  

    - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant) 

   - Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth 

- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete the analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this) or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7. Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## First Task: Notifications - 10 minutes 

the first couple of acr that looked dead set ehat . i think they ere 5-10 minutes to answeer. some were are you having symptomes. i dont think they were short answers
- How were you notified, such as a text or email, that your provider wanted you to answer some questions prior to your appointment?
- -test message
  - You should have been sent [text or email] by Perigean for today's session. Please bring up the [text or email], then share your screen. [**Moderator Note:** Help participant open the link and screen share if necessary. If the participant is unable to share their screen, then share your screen and follow the participant’s instructions.] [Mobile screen sharing instructions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-mobile-sessions) 

- How far in advance of your appointment did you receive this notification?
- primacty care 1 month before tother, 2-3 days before mental health 2 days before appointment.

  - Do you feel that you were given enough time or not enough time to answer the questions prior to your appointment?
  -  enough time for bother of them

  - Would you want to receive this notification at a different time prior to your appointment than you did, such as earlier to later? Why?
  - for pc 1 month before was a litlle early, 2 weeks before, if they were sync with labs.
  - behavorial health, 2 or 1 day.
  - any sooner like day of would be frustrating.
 
  - 

  - Please review the information in this notification and share your overall impressions. Think aloud as you review. 
the first 1 is consent that looks fine (consent). it looks like the one i have before. i would like wich provider because sometimes i have 2 appoinments a week and even tell me which department like behavioral health.

no if took away too many words wouldn be enought.


  - [**Notetaker:** Note any observations about the following things: What do they comment on as confusing or valuable without prompting?] 

  - Was there anything about the notification that is unclear? 

  - Would you add, delete, or change about the content within the notification? 

- How much time do you estimate it took you to complete the questions after clicking on the [text or email]? 
about 5 to 10 minutes. 
 

## Second Task: Complete the clinical reminders - 20 minutes 

  

- Next, pretend that you are answering the pre-appointment questions again. We also call these clinical reminders, so you may hear me refer to them as such. Some of the questions will be familiar to you as you answered them before your appointment, while others may not. Please think a loud as you review the screens. I’ll ask you a few questions as you move though too.
  - [eScreening link](https://escreening.va.gov/but/assessment/home)
  - participant is reading outloud. okay, about sexual orientatioation, only recetly found out a lgbtq liason, their should be some point of contact .  I want the liason automatic contact me, but some people may find that intrusive so it would be good to ask them (if they want to be contacted).

- [**Notetaker:** Note which questionnaire branching logic they follow and if the clinical reminders end in a positive or negative result. Write down any comments shared without prompting from the Moderator.] 

- [On each screen] Are there any terms that seem unfamiliar or confusing to you? no

- [At the end of each clinical reminder] On a scale from 1 to 5 (with 1 being very easy and 5 being very difficult), how easy or difficult was it to answer these questions about [clinical reminder topic]?
- 1 very easy

- [At the end of all the clinical reminders] 

  - What do you expect to happen next, since you answered these questions? i like the wording of stable housing since owning and renting a home is not everybody.
  - not stable housing- does not pertain to me.
  - food situation question- for me its never true. are there increments lower than 12 months? I would say 6 weeks- my friend had been on it- he not worried about it but I am worried (for freind).  In state (removed PII) im not familiar with, but i know it was not the salary they were making, I don't think its fine. but if they given this questionaire, 12 months is fine, but they might be worried in the last 6 weeks. no not other than the time fram
 
- last money food: 12 months its too long of a time frme. unless it is a new veteran and this is intial screen.  the answer would be never true for friend.
  -1 very easy
  Toxic exposures 3.1: good, pretty, I dont think I seen this questtion before- it would be good to have a list of bases and duty sessions that might be convered under that.

  -comments of link of suvery: maybe the line should be shortedn to average time: its alot of words to say is  less than 5 minutes. im not going to look up the budget number. this isnt necessary to have as a link.

  experienced toxic exporsure: let me check yes and see what happens. I can tell about contamenets that lists air or water, but would like more context of what type of toxic exposure, i want to know what I will should be be about to be scared about. will this go too mo my doctor. if Im filling it out i dont want to fill it our more than once, i want it to be in my record thay autimatically know to all my doctors. iwouldn;t eant it to be isoloated to just one doctor, i want it availbe to all doctors like pur           
pulomongist.

conserns about military exposre is too wording, shorten it.  i would acticpate a drop down menu to see what options would be. 
please describes the other exposures should be on the previoius screen, because she has not context on this screen and she will have to refer back to the prevoius page for context.
follow-up questions- if I chose top 4 options i guess im going to trigger to other departments. I would not want me to click on something and it goes no where. I'll have to do more research. why am I filling out questionaire if not triggering a follow up. I want it to sned me somtheing or have someone call me up. if no direct contact following up, then i don't want to see this question.

who would eligibility vs enrolled different. why are you asksing me sinnce I think that elliglbe and enrolled are the same thing and dont undertand how are they differentl questions.  

what kind of registry questions: they are makeing a white list of someone of toxic exposure, whtat does that registry become?
regirty questions- what does it mean and why?

it would choose hemath/medical question , have questions about other but dont know hwo woyld chose ,but if i new i would have follow up questtions then oi would choose benefits and registry. if they seend me a panphetl then I would before a hyper link. i would want direct com with someone very qiuclikluy

-the fir expesore, this page should come before the prvous question, it feels like so many onanswered things.  scale 1-5 probaly a 4 because context is out of order if i get to next screen oh i d have to change my answer to prevoius screen. 

im confused why the smoke page does not have a time frame one it. not alt all for me though. strange no time frmae. maybe this qustion is not for eclectronic it weird that they call it  might as well ask a question likek that.
never for used to tobacco?
1 very easy on tabacco quest.
tbi-the last how is it no and? I am confused as to why 2 know, no should be /negative screeening or no scrteening, it should be. tbi tramatic brain injusry knows 2 because the second had no there 2 times. 
during deployemtns⬇ whoudl we talk about shelling or under explosuion . i would pick first one (blast). it seems more limiting if mine wasnt in there then it would be confusing.
like why some have alot of context oand other have none .like "fall" no context, she needs more context. 
symptoms immediatley afterwards: there are altest 2 that are also head injuryes, would like more context cousl they is a head injury options.
get worse afterwrds: the list bis pretty straighforward.
embbedded fragments:there is alot of words, have a fatigue going through all of them, it could be summarized better, duplication of effort,a little wordy (make it short).  it was a 2.

retained fragments: it says no first though, no, the text and the paranthesis is kind of confusing , I would say blast or explowsion.
thank page: okay that the end of questions set. it would be nice to see answers flagged like a summary of respeonse, likes email me a copy of my ansers, paranioa that doc will not follow up with these.

end of prototype: i would expect the provider that would trigger it , i would expect this questionarie was the first thing we talked bout, convo about it, then move on to the rest of appoinemtn. i want it t to be in my general file.

the intake nurse mentioned questionaire but doctors did not. Mental helath provider never discussed questionaiire, BH never seems to get follow up wich i don't .

If can change 1 thing out anything today; I would have more do you think qualigy with hyper links.  I just dont want the ansers i want the questions also. some kind of summary of the questions

response on own time: on my own I may be more honest on severity or depth or I am worred I'm that they are not going to accept my ansewers if I sayit during the provider they provider will not take it serously how w sever it has bee, but if i answer on my own i will sya it has been awfule ( observer bias)

to many question, can be shortend and combined.
preferable time : shoild be less than 10 minutes. I feel there were 2 parts to that. about 20 questions and less than 10 min. if questionsssss I see all the time like BH, then it should be shorter. most likley they are the same everytime.

i like getting questions by text instead of email.how many people people are in the research study. questions how many people are involved in this reseach. 



    - Does that match what actually happened next at your appointment with your provider knowing that they reviewed your answers? Why or why not? 

  - If you could change one thing about this question experience, what would that be? 

  

## Post-Task Interview - 10 minutes 

  

- Now, I’m going to ask you a series of questions about your experience answering these questions at home (or wherever you previously chose) and not what we reviewed here today.  

- On a scale from 1 to 5 (with 1 being very easy and 5 being very difficult, how easy or difficult was it to answer these questions? 

- Did answering these questions online prior to your appointment impact the quality of your appointment with your provider in any way? If so, how? 

- Did answering the questions on your own time impact your responses compared to answering them with your provider? If so, how? 

- Were the number of questions you answered online: 

  - Too many 

  - Not enough 

  - Just right 

- What would you estimate the ideal number of minutes or question sets to complete at one time prior to one appointment? 

- And lastly, do you have any questions for me? 

- Okay, great! That is all the questions I have for you today. 

  

## Thank-You and Closing - 3 minutes 

  

Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on these experiences and make sure it really works for Veterans. 

Before you go, I wanted to iterate that everything we did today wasn’t real. The questions that you answered were not submitted to your provider or anywhere.  

Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies. 

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day! 

  

## Emergency Exit 

  

- Out of questions: We have covered all the questions I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback. 

- Blame technology: I am so sorry, but I just learned that the thing I wanted to test with you today is unexpectedly not working. I apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your time.
