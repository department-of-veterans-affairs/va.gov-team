# Participant 2 eScreening, Email 
[Brackets are notetaker comments/observers] 
 
Moderator (M): Past questionnaire experience? 

Participant (P): I can’t remember. 

M: [Shares eScreening email]  

P: I’m already assuming that I’ve already screened the email and verified that it is from the VA and stuff, then I would feel comfortable in opening it. 

M: So how do you feel about just seeing this? 

P: I would feel uncomfortable clicking on it if I wasn’t on there. I normally communicate with the VA through a secure log in. If it asked me to go through the secure log in, then I would open it. If it was a regular email, then I wouldn’t open it. 

M: Anything unclear? 

P: No, it looks pretty straight forward to me. 

M: How far in advance would you expect to receive this notification? 

P: A day or two would be fine. Not more than a week. I would forget what I responded with. 

M: Enough time to fill everything out? 

P: Absolutely. 

M: Any other changes? 

P: It does have any identification on who it is to. I want to make sure that they are talking to the correct person. It would be nice to have something added that it is covered by confidentiality rules…what is it, HIPAA? 

M: You are good with everything else that is on there? 

P: Yeah. I think everything else is pretty straight forward. 

M: [Shares eScreening prototype] 

P: I don’t have any problem with the content of the screen. 

M: Anything confusing? 

P: No. 

M: Scale 1 – 5 

P: I would rate it a 1. These questions look familiar that I might add. I think that I might have answered a questionnaire before my last meeting. [Reads food insecurity] 

M: Anything confusing? 

P: No. 

M: Scale 1 – 5 

P: 2, because there are a lot of words on there. Would change it to “Are you worried…”? [Reads toxic exposure] I’m wondering why Agent Orange is buried in the back. I would put it in the chronological order. I don’t know if it is related to Camp Legeune or while served in the armed forces at any time. I’m a Vietnam Veteran. When Camp Lejeune is so prominent that make me question it. 

M: It is confusing that they list some contaminants and places. 

P: I think that it needs to differentiate between Korean, Gulf War. Vietnam. They are trying to group everyone in one question. 

M: Does if they don’t see Vietnam that they might select no? 

P: Yes, because it only says Camp Legeune. 

M: Anything else? 

P: No. I think that the rest of the wording is fine. It just needs to be organized by where you served. 

M: Scale 1-5 

P: 4 [Continues on with more TES questions] Other exposures. I would answer “Don’t know,” but that isn’t an option. I would like to see an option of “Don’t know,” because god knows what we were exposed to. [About TES links] I would click on each of these links to see. I’m assuming that it is giving me the presumptive conditions and more information on how to file under the PACT ACT and give me more information about toxic exposure. [Asks moderator to click link on presumptive conditions for Agent Orange] I would link on everyone that I was potentially part of.  

M: After you clicked on all of the links, what would you do next? 

P: [Reads TES follow-up question] I would probably click on the health/medical questions. I would click on the VA health care enrollment one, because I’m already in the healthcare system. I would click on the registry one, because I’m not sure if I’m on the Agent Orange registry or what the eligibility requirements are for those. I would click on benefits to make sure that I’m getting everything. [Reviewing information below the question] I would probably call the environmental health coordinator. I am already service connected [for a few conditions]. I would expect further evaluation from the VA.  

M: Any terms that are confusing on here? 

P: I’m not sure that everyone knows what the Veterans Benefits Administration is. 

M: Would you want a link with a definition? 

P: yes. 

M: Scale 1 -5  

P: 3, because you have to think about a lot of different things. Do you want to continue. There are a lot of buttons to push to find out the information. I may get bored with it and go back to the information later. [Goes onto embedded fragments screener] I would answer No. 

M: Anything confusing on this page? 

P: No. I kind of like that it kind of generically covers all conflicts.  

M: Scale 1- 5 

P: 1. Maybe a 1.5, because the military’s use of acronym gets off putting when you haven’t been in the military for a while. [Reads TBI screener] That is perfectly straight forward. There are psychological health and safety problems for all conflicts that Veterans were in. But it is ok for what it is. [Reads Tobacco screener]  

M: Scale 1 -5  

P: I guess that I would rate it a 1. The only hesitance that I have about it is that “have I smoked a cigar in the last 15 years?” Maybe, but it was a one and done thing. 

M: [Goes back to the questions] Would you want to change anything? 

P: No, because I consider that I haven’t smoked regularly in over 30 years. I guess that the wording is ok. I would say a 1. 

M: [Reads finish page] 

P: I would hit the finish button and be finished. [Reads final page] I would push the done button. I think all of those statements are easy for me to understand. I would rate it a 1. As far as thinking out loud, I would ask for a print out of what my response are. Simply because I have what is call dual coverage with the VA and other insurance. I see a cardiologist outside the VA and other providers. I’ve asked for the information to be shared, but I don’t know if the information appears in my record. How would I make sure that the information shows up for my primary care providers? 

M: So you want information about what happens next? 

P: yes and I think that there should be a question about if you have information outside of the VA. 

M: After taking this, what do you think will happen next? Where does it go? 

P: It would go to the VA primary care provider. It would be his discretion if further follow-up was required. 

M: If you could change 1 thing, what would it be? 

P: I’m used to spending long periods of time in concentrated effort. I’m not sure my other Veterans are the same way. I’m split it up. Send some questions at one time and send some at another. It is a long process to knock it all out. 

M: Impact to quality of the appointment? 

P: I think that it would be helpful to the provider. When you are sitting at home and thinking about what you have. I think that you get better information when you are relaxed and sitting at home. 

M: Answering at home impact responses? 

P: Yes. I would be much more through answering it at home, then answering them at the doctor’s office.  

M: Number of questions? 

P: I think they are too many for one sitting. It should be broken down into third. 

M: # of questions or minutes? 

P: 20 minutes. I’m not speaking specifically for me, but for other Veterans. I know that they wouldn’t put up with an hour worth of questions.
