# Participant 8, eScreening, Email 
[Brackets are notetaker comments/observers] 
 
Moderator (M): Past experience with questionnaires? 

Participant (P): Every now and then I have to do that. 

M: How were you notified that your provider wanted you to answer questions? 

P: Probably emails. 

M: How far in advance did you receive the notification? 

P: I would say a week. 

M: What types of questions did they ask you? 

P: Any changes in medications or any change in what I was seeing them for. 

M: Enough time or not enough time? 

P: It was more than enough. 

M: Receive at a different time? 

P: It doesn’t matter. 

M: [Shares BHL email] Anything unclear? 

P: No. 

M: How far in advance would you expect to receive this notification? 

P: The Friday before I tend to get a reminder. So within a week. I get an email, a text, and a phone call. 

M: You normally get all three? 

P: Yes. 

M Any changes to content? 

P: I guess for the sake of the content itself. I don’t think the second two paragraphs are necessary, because I have that information.  

M: What would you like to see in here that isn’t in here? 

P: Nothing really. 

M: Would you click on this here? 

P: Yes 

M: [Shares prototype] 

P: [Reads sexual orientation screener] I don’t know what the purpose of this question is. 

M: Elaborate on why? 

P: I’m not sure. Although I’m straight, I’m not sure what their sexual orientation has to do with their preventative care. 

M: So you don’t think this question should exist before an appointment? 

P: Correct. 

M: Scale 1 – 5 

P: 1 [Reads homelessness screener] 

M: Anything confusing on this page? 

P: Not at all 

M: Scale 1 -5? 

P: 1 [reads next homelessness question] It is clear. 1. [Reads food insecurity questions. No usability problems to comment on]  

M: Easy to understand? Scale 1 – 5? 

P: Easy to understand. 1. [Moves onto other food insecurity question] It is a simple question. 

M: Does the wording make sense to you? 

P: Yes 

M: Are all the options covering everything that you would answer? 

P: Yes 

M: Scale 1 – 5? 

P: 1 [Reads TES intro page] The content would be fine, except where they say that they are screening all Veterans about toxic exposure. What do they mean by screening? Are they talking to every Veteran or are they doing other tests? 

M: So you want clarification on what screening means? 

P: yes 

M: Missing anything in the list? 

P: I don’t know what other exposures there are. From what I know about exposures, this covers everything that I know of. 

M: What about Veterans in other efforts? Would you change anything about this list? 

P: I would put more information about what other exposure are instead of just listing “Other exposures.” 

M: Scale 1 -5? 

P: It is easy for me to answer the question. 1 [Continues onto the second TES intro page] Basically, you can choose if you want to answer a survey that they have? 

M: Is anything unnecessary? 

P: Office of Management number and expiration date. If I chose to do it, I don’t care when you decided to set it up. [Reads first TES question] This list is fine, and it is also kind of hard for people to answer that question. Even though I wasn’t in a war zone, I was out of the country. I do have some issues that I didn’t have before I left for out of the country. There is always the question whether my health issues came from exposure with ammunition or some other exposure. “Other such exposures” isn’t helpful to people. What would those exposure be? Up until a few years ago, the Camp Leguene water exposure would have been in the other list. [Reads TES follow-up question] Based on the first screen, where it told you if you had questions and where to reach out to your provider, I don’t think that this question is necessary for the survey. 

M: All questions or a certain one? 

P: If someone had questions about benefits, then I don’t think someone would be looking for that here. If I have a doctor’s appointment, then they are going to turn around and ask me these questions again. The doctor wouldn’t be able to answer benefits questions. I already have VA healthcare. I don’t think this is necessary to answer prior to an appointment. 

M: What about “health/medical questions?” 

P: It is a possibly, but it depends upon who I’m seeing. I go to VA for dermatology. It would depend upon who I’m seeing. 

M: Scale 1-5? 

P: 1 [Reads TES thank you page] No, it is not confusing. Rather than based on the responses that a person gives, the links should automatically be sent to a Veteran enrolled in the health system. 

M: Think that it should be more personalized to the Veteran? 

P: I do. 

M: Scale 1- 5? 

P: 1 [Continues to tobacco question]  

M: Anything confusing? 

P: Not at all. 

M: Scale 1-5? 

P: 1 [Reads second tobacco question] I have no thoughts about this questions. It is just a general question. Rating 1. [Reads TBI screener] It is a simple question. Answers no. Rating 1. [Continues onto embedded fragments screening]  

M: Anything unfamiliar? 

P: No, but for anyone that hasn’t been injured by a blast, this is a redundant question. It doesn’t apply to every Veteran. This should be a personalized question. 

M: Does it offend you or annoy since it is here? 

P: It just is a waste of time. 

M: You would rather not have questions like this. 

P: Right 

M: Acronyms? Are you familiar with them? 

P I am.  

M: Scale 1 -5? 

P: 1 [Reads final page] It is telling you to discuss your responses with your health care team. I’m assuming that when it says that it isn’t reviewed in real time that no one is going to follow-up with you on this, but it will be sent to the care team. The 911 or crisis information isn’t necessary for this questionnaire. If they already made the appointment, then they would have already received that information. 

M: Anything missing? 

P: No. 

M: Scale 1 – 5? 

P: 1 

M:  Would you expect answering these questions would impact the quality of your appointment? 

P: No, because the questions that were asked would not really pertinent to the needed information for the health provider. They don’t seem pertinent to a specific health problems or if you changed your medications. It was just general information that the VA needed to know and could have been sent anytime. It wasn’t related to a particular appointment. 

M: What would happen next? 

P: Hopefully, into the Veteran file, so the questions wouldn’t have to be repeated. 

M: Go into a file without physicians seeing it. 

P: Meaning your medical file, so all your providers would see these questions and the nurses wouldn’t have to ask these questions again. Most of my providers, I have seen before. Most of the questions asked, I don’t think would help with a medical appointment. 

M: Answering online would impact what your reply? 

P: No. My response would be the same either way. 

M: Frequency of the questions? 

P: None of the above. There wasn’t too many. It was just questions that needed to be answered. If there were more questions that needed to be answered, then I would answer them. 

M: So there shouldn’t be a time limit on it? 

P: Right? 

M: Ideal time? 

P: No more than 5 -10 minutes to answer questions to prepare for a medical appointment. 

M: Change anything what would you change? 

P: The sexual orientation question, I would have left out. The toxic exposure questions should be asked to Veterans specifically that those questions pertain to.
