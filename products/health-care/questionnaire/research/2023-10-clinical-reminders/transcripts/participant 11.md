# Participant 11 BHL, Text 
[Brackets are notetaker comments/observers] 
 
Moderator (M): Past questionnaire experience? 

Participant (P): I did and I used to do. The VA does a pretty good job at sending those pre-appointment questions. I look forward to them. 

M: How did you receive them? 

P: Sometimes it is an email and sometimes it is a phone call. It can be brief and that is nice, so I can get back to what I’m doing. I normally get a heads up. I might get a call on a Monday/Tuesday before a meeting later in the week. They ask the questions then.  

M: What kinds of questions do they ask? 

P: This last visit, I did a full workup. It was all types of questions. I’m pre-diabetic, so a lot of the questions centered on that. What is my sugar intake? My doctor already has me on a regime. 

M: Do you get enough time to answer these? 

P: Yes. I appreciate that. Want to receive a notification maybe a week out. Maybe giving my just a little more notice. All of my appointments are during my working hours. I have to make adjustments. 

M: [Shares BHL text] 

P: It is short and to the point. 

M: Changes? 

P: I might have the time of the appointment. It won’t hurt to have it in the text as well. Maybe even the doctor’s name. 

M: Would that make you feel more comfortable? 

P: Yeah. 

M: Estimated time to fill out? 

P: Estimate that it would take 20-30 minutes. I’d prefer to have it condensed to 10 or 15 minutes. I don’t know why if the questions are about me, that it shouldn’t take any more than 10 minutes. 

M: [Shares BHL prototype] 

P: Using a laptop. [Reads sexual orientation screener] No. They are all straight and direct.  

M: Scale 1 -5? 

P: 1 [Reads homeless screener] No [comments]. Rating 1. [Reads the second homelessness question. Says “no, not worried”, but clicked on “Yes, worried.” Gets more questions about where they live. No comments about that question. Reads “would you like to comment on where you have lived for MOST of the past 2 months?” They want to add a N/A or I don’t know.]  

M: Anything confusing? 

P: No. 

M: Scale 1 -5? 

P: 1 [On the page where you enter info about your housing] It is self-explanatory. Rating 1. [Referred to talk about housing situation. Selects yes] I don’t know how this deals with my appointment. 

M: Where do you think that it would go? 

P: I think that it would get routed to someone who might call me about my housing situation. For me, I think that we are getting off of me and my health issues. I don’t know how my living situation would deal with my appointment. I have a doctor who never really asked me about my housing situation. It seems irrelevant to not just me, but other people. Rating 1. [Talking about the “What’s the best way to reach you?”] Can I enter more than one way? [Writes “email,” but not their actual email address.]  

M: Does the text box limit you to one answer? 

P: I do think that. Rating 2, because it is restricting me to one answer. Choices have been taken away. [Moves onto food insecurity] Writes sometimes true. 

M: [Asks about how to answer.] 

P: I don’t want to miss my appointment. I understand a lot about self-care. Some questions might make me feel uncomfortable or comfortable. I would still go through with my appointment. [Reads second food insecurity questions] I know how to make a dollar last. [Reads toxic exposure intro page] Rating 1. [Reads second intro page] This little paragraph gives a lot of information. I don’t think that is the telephone number, because it doesn’t have an area code [when commenting on the OMB number]. I do like to also call. The turnaround time for emails can be long. Rating 1. [Reads first TES question] This doesn’t apply to me personally.  

M: What would you like to see on this page? 

P: Maybe what I was exposed to. I was on a navy ship, so something hearing related. With the planes taking off, I was exposed.  

M: What if it listed your actual deployment or service that you were in? 

P: Nothing is confusing. Rating 1. [Reads toxic exposure wrap-up page] This would be a 1. Pretty cut and dry. [Reads tobacco question] Nothing confusing. A 1. [Have you ever used tobacco?] I think that there should be more answers like used one time or really? Rating 1. [Reads TBI question] Rating 1. [Reads TBI events questions] I’m looking for options to “Other injuries.” I got other injuries not to the head or off duty injuries. That is what I would be looking for. Rating [notetaker missed the rating] [Reads embedded fragments screening] Nothing confusing. Rating 1. [Reads “Do you suspect that you have a retained fragment] No, I understand all of those terms. Rating 1. [Reads final page] I actually think that it has a lot of important information. I might copy it down. 

M: What do you find important? 

P: That I have three ways to get help. Also, to call 911.  

M: Anything missing? 

P: No. Rating 2, because my responses are not reviewed in real time like I would like them to be. 

M: What do you think will happen next? 

P: I think that it will be submitted to my team for review. Someone from the care team [might reach out]. 

M: Change one thing? 

P: Give me more answer choices to choose from, so I won’t feel so limited.  

M: Would you expect answering these questions online would impact appointment? 

P: I would. I think that I would feel more included. I always feel like I’m in good hands at the VA. Overall, I love my care team and the facility that I go to. I drive out of my way to go there. They know me. 

M: Answering on own time versus with provider? 

P: Prefer to answer on my own time. As soon as I get time, I will knock it out. 

M: How long before an appointment? 

P: A day or two. No more than 48 hours. 

M: Too many or not enough? 

P: Not enough. It could have been a lot more. Half of them didn’t apply to me. If it didn’t apply to me, then I would feel like it was wasting my time. If they applied to me, then I would feel more excited to go to my appointment.  

M: Ideal time? 

P: [Notetaker missed this]
