## Intro - 5 minutes 

  

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Kristen] and we have our notetaker on for taking notes. 

I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...  

  

Today we're going to talk about your experience receiving a text or email, then answering health questions online. These questions helped your primary care provider prepare for your recent medical appointment. 

  

Before we start, a few things I want to mention: 

  

- **This entire session should take about [an hour].** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic. 

- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. 

- **You'll be interacting with a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may look and function like the live site but since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA healthcare.

- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**  

- Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I want to be sure before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?** 

   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom. 

   - If yes: Admit observers.  

    - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant) 

   - Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth 

- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete the analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this) or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7. Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

**(2:11 p.m.)**
## First Task: Notifications - 10 minutes 


- How were you notified, such as a text or email, that your provider wanted you to answer some questions prior to your appointment?
  - You should have been sent [text or email] by Perigean for today's session. Please bring up the [text or email], then share your screen. [**Moderator Note:** Help participant open the link and screen share if necessary. If the participant is unable to share their screen, then share your screen and follow the participant’s instructions.] [Mobile screen sharing instructions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-mobile-sessions) 

- How far in advance of your appointment did you receive this notification? **(2:13 p.m.)**

  - Do you feel that you were given enough time or not enough time to answer the questions prior to your appointment? 

  - Would you want to receive this notification at a different time prior to your appointment than you did, such as earlier to later? Why? 

  - Please review the information in this notification and share your overall impressions. Think aloud as you review. 

  - [**Notetaker:** Note any observations about the following things: What do they comment on as confusing or valuable without prompting?] 

  - Was there anything about the notification that is unclear?
  - **(2:15 p.m.)**

  - Would you add, delete, or change about the content within the notification? 

- How much time do you estimate it took you to complete the questions after clicking on the [text or email]? **(2:16 p.m.)**

 

## Second Task: Complete the clinical reminders - 20 minutes 

  

- Next, pretend that you are answering the pre-appointment questions again. We also call these clinical reminders, so you may hear me refer to them as such. Some of the questions will be familiar to you as you answered them before your appointment, while others may not. Please think a loud as you review the screens. I’ll ask you a few questions as you move though too.**(2:17 p.m.)**
  - [eScreening link](https://escreening.va.gov/but/assessment/home)  

- [**Notetaker:** Note which questionnaire branching logic they follow and if the clinical reminders end in a positive or negative result. Write down any comments shared without prompting from the Moderator.] 

- [On each screen] Are there any terms that seem unfamiliar or confusing to you? **(2:18 p.m.)**

- [At the end of each clinical reminder] On a scale from 1 to 5 (with 1 being very easy and 5 being very difficult), how easy or difficult was it to answer these questions about [clinical reminder topic]? **(2:20 p.m.)**

    - Does that match what actually happened next at your appointment with your provider knowing that they reviewed your answers? Why or why not? 

  - If you could change one thing about this question experience, what would that be?
  -  **Participant found a few of those questions were unclear.**

  

## Post-Task Interview - 10 minutes 

  

- Now, I’m going to ask you a series of questions about your experience answering these questions at home (or wherever you previously chose) and not what we reviewed here today.  

- On a scale from 1 to 5 (with 1 being very easy and 5 being very difficult, how easy or difficult was it to answer these questions? **(2:39)They were about a 2.**

- Did answering these questions online prior to your appointment impact the quality of your appointment with your provider in any way? If so, how? 

- Did answering the questions on your own time impact your responses compared to answering them with your provider? If so, how? 

- Were the number of questions you answered online: 

  - Too many 

  - Not enough 

  - Just right 
**(2:42) Not too many questions.**
- What would you estimate the ideal number of minutes or question sets to complete at one time prior to one appointment? **10 or 15 minutes is appropriate.**

- And lastly, do you have any questions for me?  **(2:43 p.m.)**

- Okay, great! That is all the questions I have for you today. 

**Participants suggests to make it more clear that they will be going through  all the reminders.**

## Thank-You and Closing - 3 minutes  **(2:44 p.m.)**

  

Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on these experiences and make sure it really works for Veterans. 

Before you go, I wanted to iterate that everything we did today wasn’t real. The questions that you answered were not submitted to your provider or anywhere.  

Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies. 

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day! 

  

## Emergency Exit 

  

- Out of questions: We have covered all the questions I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback. 

- Blame technology: I am so sorry, but I just learned that the thing I wanted to test with you today is unexpectedly not working. I apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your time.
