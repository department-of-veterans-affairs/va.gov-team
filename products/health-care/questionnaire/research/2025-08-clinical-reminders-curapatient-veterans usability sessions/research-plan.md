# Research Plan for Clinical Reminder pilot: CuraPatient Prototype Usability Sessions with Veterans, August 2025

## Background

The Clinical Reminder system helps caregivers deliver higher quality care to patients for both preventive health care and management of chronic conditions and helps ensure that timely clinical interventions are initiated. Reminders assist clinical decision-making and also improve documentation and follow-up, by allowing providers to easily view dates when certain tests or evaluations were performed and to track and document when care has been delivered.

The volume of clinical reminders has been impacting the quality of the time the patient spends with the provider. Providers have also reported increased burden due to data entry and notification fatigue. Therefore, Veteran Health Administration (VHA) is in search of a COTS tool that allows customizable and standardized health forms, screeners, and questionnaires to be sent to the patient to collect responses asynchronously.

## OCTO priorities
Enhance Veterans' personalized online experience

## Veteran journey
Taking care of myself through aging

## Research goals
This study will gather feedback from Veterans on the CuraPatient platform tool as they respond to health questionnaires using a prototype via the VA sandbox.

### Outcome
The data and findings will provide evidence for the recommendation on whether CuraPatient is a viable option to serve as a VA enterprise-level questionnaire platform tool.

## Research questions
1. Can users navigate the questionnaire platform without needing help?
2. Can users find help if they need it?
3. Are important actions like starting, pausing, re-entering, submitting, and reviewing clearly labeled?
4. Can users pause in the middle of the questionnaire and return at a later time without losing their progress?
5. Is the UI confusing or difficult in some way?
6. Are the instructions/questions easy to understand (does it use plain language)?
7. How does the platform tool function/display on smartphones, tablets, desktops; are there any issues with layout, loading, or scrolling?
8. Do users feel confident that their health information will be safe and secure using this platform tool?
9. Does the user encounter any bugs or technical issues; and can they recover easily?
10. Do Veterans find the length of time to complete the experience reasonable?
11. Do users receive the appropriate system feedback during the experience?
12. Do users receive confirmation that their responses were submitted successfully?
13. Would users be willing to use this tool again on a regular cadence to respond to health questionnaires?
14. How could the tool or experience be improved?
15. How does this tool compare to other platforms users have used to fill out asynchronous health questionnaires?

## Hypotheses
1. Veterans will find the CuraPatient prototype easy to navigate.
2. Veterans will find the CuraPatient prototype to impose a low cognitive load.
3. Veterans will find the CuraPatient prototype to have good compatibility and interoperability with other tools and systems.
4. Veterans will trust their health information is safe with using the CuraPatient prototype.
5. Veterans will experience few errors while using the CuraPatient prototype.
6. Veterans find the length of time to complete the questionnaires on the CuraPatient prototype reasonable.
7. Veterans will find the system feedback provided by the CuraPatient prototype to be appropriate and clear.
8. Veterans will have a positive overall experience with the CuraPatient prototype and will be comfortable using it regularly.
9. Veterans will find the CuraPatient prototype suitable based on other emerging criteria observed during testing.
