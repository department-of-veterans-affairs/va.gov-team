1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.830
Moderator: So

2
00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:08.630
Moderator: I just started the recording and to confirm, are you still comfortable with me, recording my screen and audio.

3
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:09.440
P2: Yes.

4
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:26.889
Moderator: Great. Okay? So now we can get started before we open the screen, I want to ask, have you ever filled out health questionnaires from your Va. Provider, either during your appointment or through email or text.

5
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.810
P2: Yes.

6
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.169
Moderator: Yes. Okay. Could you tell me about your experience?

7
00:00:32.652 --> 00:00:39.349
P2: Well, the questionnaire somewhat can be difficult. What could be a little miss

8
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:56.510
P2: confusing, depending on how they ask the questions, because some questions is direct. You know what to answer, how to answer, and then some of the questions. Some of them may sound like repetitive, or it's like, what exactly. Are they they asking?

9
00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:05.080
Moderator: So, yeah, and do you remember any examples of these like confusing questions?

10
00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:19.010
P2: I can't think of any right now, because it's been a while since I actually did a questionnaire always send emails. Now, just so I don't have to do questionnaires most of the time. I just do a email to my doctor.

11
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.680
Moderator: Oh, can you tell me what you put in those emails.

12
00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:32.510
P2: Well, even like today, I had to send an email to my primary care, doctor, because I need a referral, for, like my mammogram.

13
00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:33.035
Moderator: Hmm,

14
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:41.060
P2: And so I just went in there and told him, Hey, you know it's time for my mammogram. Can you give me a referral so I can get it done.

15
00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:58.520
Moderator: Oh, okay, yeah, that makes sense. And then for those like health questionnaires, like lists of questions that you have filled out before? Have those all been in person during your appointment? Or have you also filled them out via, like email or text.

16
00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:12.599
P2: Well, it has been via when I go there, and they give it to you a questionnaire that you have to answer because they used to send them like before your appointment. But now I don't get any before my appointment.

17
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.120
Moderator: I just.

18
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.390
P2: Get a reminder of my appointment.

19
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:21.250
Moderator: Yeah, when you used to get them before your appointments was that email or text.

20
00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.889
P2: No, no! Before it was when I got there at the doctor office.

21
00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.339
Moderator: Oh, like you fill it out in the waiting room.

22
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.060
P2: In the waiting room.

23
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:32.549
Moderator: Yeah, okay, okay,

24
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:47.220
Moderator: that sounds great cool. So today, we're going to pretend that you have a doctor's appointment in 2 days. And your doctor emailed you the health questionnaire to fill out before your appointment.

25
00:02:47.698 --> 00:03:00.259
Moderator: So these questionnaires may or may not be related to the appointment you have scheduled, and some of the questions will be familiar to you because you've answered them before, while others might seem new.

26
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:19.540
Moderator: So I'm just going to share a link with you, and then have you, as you go through each screen, think out loud. Tell me what you think about it, and I'll ask you questions as you go, and just a reminder that your answers are not going to affect you or your benefits?

27
00:03:20.249 --> 00:03:26.119
Moderator: Before I share that would you share what device you're using right now.

28
00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:27.950
P2: My computer.

29
00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:35.529
Moderator: Okay, great and I am going to put that link in the chat.

30
00:03:36.541 --> 00:03:40.968
Moderator: And before you click it, just to make sure

31
00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.409
Moderator: We're all set up. Could you share your screen?

32
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.030
P2: Okay, down at the bottom, where you say share.

33
00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.699
Moderator: Yeah. The green button.

34
00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:52.710
P2: Okay.

35
00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:06.549
Moderator: Okay, great. And now, if you can go back to our zoom window, it's in the bottom right

36
00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.030
Moderator: of your toolbar.

37
00:04:09.614 --> 00:04:13.660
Moderator: There's that. Yes, I think we should be in there.

38
00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.910
Moderator: Oh.

39
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.319
P2: So, okay, this meeting is being recorded. Okay,

40
00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:32.080
Moderator: Do you see? So sometimes when you share your screen, there's like bars that you can see that I am not able to see. Do you.

41
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.810
P2: Right.

42
00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.430
Moderator: Black toolbar anywhere that has.

43
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.820
P2: A bunch of.

44
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:37.930
Moderator: Buttons on it.

45
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.130
P2: Yes, I do, perfect, and that's

46
00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:45.090
P2: say, participants, for so I need to go back to show meeting.

47
00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.600
Moderator: Yes.

48
00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:47.970
P2: Okay.

49
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.180
Moderator: Just to make sure.

50
00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.249
P2: Okay, there, we go.

51
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:56.490
Moderator: Okay? And then in the meeting there should be a chat button.

52
00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:57.470
P2: Yes.

53
00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:00.709
Moderator: Okay. And if you click that there should be a link in there.

54
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.560
P2: Okay. Yes.

55
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:07.335
Moderator: Perfect.

56
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.389
P2: Oh! The screen went away. Now. Can you still see me.

57
00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:18.720
Moderator: I can see you, and I can see the screen you're seeing, it says like your clinical reminders.

58
00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.040
P2: Okay.

59
00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:38.130
Moderator: Perfect. Okay, so we're going to go through these questions. But before you click anything, I just want to know, like, what are your 1st impressions. After opening this page.

60
00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.070
P2: Okay.

61
00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:52.280
P2: Well, it don't say about me having an appointment. So these the stuff that's up here I haven't seen before.

62
00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.959
Moderator: you can go ahead and start answering the questions.

63
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.379
P2: Okay, so start clinical reminders.

64
00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:07.350
P2: Okay.

65
00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:33.119
Moderator: Okay. And so for each screen from now on, I want you to just think out loud. Tell me what you think of the page. Before you move on. And we're really especially interested in what you think of the formatting and how the questions are laid out, and we're less focused on the wording of the questions unless they're like, really, really confusing.

66
00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:34.660
P2: Okay.

67
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:41.579
P2: Alright. So the 1st one I like. I like the fact that the letter. The question itself is big.

68
00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:47.469
P2: So it stands out, and then they have the answers up underneath.

69
00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:59.209
P2: So I like that. So it's not not confusing, and it and it's not matching to, you know you can't differentiate which one is which.

70
00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:06.229
Moderator: Yes, yeah, great. So go ahead and answer.

71
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:12.260
P2: Hmm, okay.

72
00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:19.019
P2: The second question. It was quick, which was good.

73
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:22.620
Moderator: Quick to go from between pages. You mean.

74
00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:27.830
P2: Right when I click this like the other one automatically came up. It wasn't a delay.

75
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:28.445
Moderator: Hmm,

76
00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:30.969
P2: For a delay that was noticeable.

77
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:32.210
Moderator: Yeah.

78
00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:45.319
P2: Okay? And the same thing with the second one. I understand the questions. The writing is, you know, is big enough for me to see.

79
00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:50.739
P2: So I can go ahead and answer this question.

80
00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:56.690
Moderator: Oh!

81
00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:05.620
P2: Okay, one hand notice they have a score. So do you get a score at the end of the questionnaire?

82
00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:08.109
Moderator: Yeah, what do you think it means?

83
00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:14.389
P2: Well, let's say a score. I feel like I'm being tested on something

84
00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:20.349
P2: that is giving me a score at the end. It's like, did I do good? Did I do bad?

85
00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:24.839
Moderator: Yeah, and what do you? How do you feel about that?

86
00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:28.380
P2: For a questionnaire.

87
00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:40.919
P2: I wouldn't think that they would have a score that you would get on a questionnaire, and but I haven't finished the question. So maybe it's a question on there that I need a score on. I'm not sure.

88
00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:41.875
Moderator: Hmm,

89
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:51.270
Moderator: that's good feedback. And then, same thing, could you read the screen out loud and tell me what you think of it.

90
00:08:51.570 --> 00:09:09.319
P2: Okay, food insecurities. The following are 2 statements that people may make about their food situation, for each statement. Please indicate whether the statement has been often true, sometimes true or never true, for your household in the last 12 months.

91
00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:18.260
P2: Okay, within the past 12 months you worried whether your food will run out before you got money to buy more.

92
00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:23.529
P2: Okay? So the answer would be, no to that.

93
00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:38.150
P2: So this sometimes, when they say often true, sometimes true or never true.

94
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:47.520
P2: Instead is like Yes, no, or or like yes, sometimes or no.

95
00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:49.810
Moderator: Yeah.

96
00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:52.130
P2: What to me would be more direct.

97
00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:59.510
Moderator: Yeah, that makes sense, does it?

98
00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:03.341
Moderator: Could you tell me more about

99
00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:08.240
Moderator: like, does this affect your ability to answer the question.

100
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.290
P2: No, I still can answer the question, but I guess for me, like I said, it would be

101
00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:24.080
P2: more easier to understand when they say, often true, sometimes true and never true. So it's like for me you have to sometime like think about it.

102
00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:31.130
Moderator: Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. Okay, go ahead and

103
00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:39.639
Moderator: click an option. But before you hit submit, actually, I want to

104
00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:43.106
Moderator: Throw in a little scenario.

105
00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:43.970
P2: Okay.

106
00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:48.199
Moderator: Let's pretend that you just received a call from a friend

107
00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:56.690
Moderator: and you know you're going to be talking for a while. While. You're in the middle of this page. What would you do next?

108
00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:02.150
P2: While I'm in the middle of doing the survey.

109
00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:10.320
Moderator: Yeah, you got a phone call. It's important. You need to step away for like 30 min.

110
00:11:13.456 --> 00:11:15.749
P2: I would leave it up, or I would.

111
00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:19.149
P2: you said it's an important phone call, correct.

112
00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:21.249
Moderator: You gotta take the phone call. Yeah.

113
00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:29.089
P2: Okay, I gotta take the phone call. So I would, you know, pick up the phone and ask them, is an emergency, or can I call you back?

114
00:11:29.504 --> 00:11:43.810
P2: Because if it's something that can wait, I would tell them, look, I'm doing it in the middle of doing a questionnaire, and I have a certain amount of time to do it in, because most of the time the questionnaires. You only have a certain amount of time, and then it times out.

115
00:11:45.576 --> 00:11:46.109
Moderator: yeah.

116
00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:55.179
P2: I don't want to take chances on getting timed out, so I rather, you know, handle the call. If it can wait, I'll return the call and finish my questionnaire.

117
00:11:55.710 --> 00:12:06.060
Moderator: Yeah, that makes sense. So in this scenario, you do have to step away. What would you do like with your screen while you're on the call.

118
00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:14.099
P2: Oh, I'm at home, so I would leave it open. I wouldn't close it up unless then I was like in a public place.

119
00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:15.630
Moderator: Yeah, yeah.

120
00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:19.550
Moderator: And then what would you expect to happen when you come back?

121
00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:22.649
P2: I would expect to.

122
00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:32.639
P2: Maybe log back in, could that could happen, or either just click the button, and it opens back up

123
00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:36.920
P2: to where I left off at, and not make me start all over again.

124
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:39.249
Moderator: Yeah, yeah.

125
00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:41.840
Moderator: Let's

126
00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:54.530
Moderator: try and pretend that you you had to take a call. You had to close your window and open it up again. Could you go through that? Please.

127
00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:59.360
P2: Okay, you mean what would happen or.

128
00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:05.150
Moderator: Could you actually close the window and then open that link? I sent you one more time.

129
00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:07.269
P2: Oh, you want me to actually do it!

130
00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:08.300
Moderator: Yes.

131
00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:12.799
P2: Oh, okay, hopefully, I don't lose you.

132
00:13:13.984 --> 00:13:17.829
P2: So just close it at the X up top right.

133
00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:19.659
Moderator: Yeah. Yes.

134
00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:24.770
P2: Okay, alright, and then open the link again.

135
00:13:30.058 --> 00:13:33.189
Moderator: So is this, what you expected to see?

136
00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:49.769
P2: no, not really cause I wasn't gone that long. So like I said with my own private computer, I feel like, you know, if I didn't close it out

137
00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:55.440
P2: I shouldn't have to log back in and like start it all over again.

138
00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:56.960
Moderator: Hmm.

139
00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:01.720
P2: But if I logged out because I did log out officially right.

140
00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:06.839
Moderator: Yeah, let's say, what happened is that it timed out

141
00:14:07.542 --> 00:14:13.700
Moderator: because you were gone for a while. And this is what you see when you log back in.

142
00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:24.000
P2: Okay, yeah. If it timed out, I would expect for it to, you know. Say, you know, to start back to the but I wouldn't expect for it not to save

143
00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:27.630
P2: questions that are already answered.

144
00:14:28.723 --> 00:14:29.670
Moderator: Yeah, so.

145
00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:34.810
P2: So I would be expecting to log back in and go back to where I left off at.

146
00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:40.468
Moderator: Yes, so let's see if it did that

147
00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:49.700
P2: Okay, no, it didn't. It start back over again.

148
00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:54.399
Moderator: Yeah, so what would you have expected to happen.

149
00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:57.909
P2: I would expect for me to

150
00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:00.039
P2: pick up where I left off at.

151
00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:09.779
Moderator: Yeah. So the exact same question that you had just finished.

152
00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:13.850
Moderator: you would expect to have still been done.

153
00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:15.150
P2: Yes.

154
00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:22.430
Moderator: Yes, okay, so if you could just fill this out again, so we can continue.

155
00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:24.340
P2: Okay.

156
00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:47.000
P2: okay, go ahead and submit. Now.

157
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.010
Moderator: Yeah, or was there anything unexpected or unclear here.

158
00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:55.429
P2: No everything is good.

159
00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:58.290
Moderator: Great. Okay. Keep going.

160
00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:06.940
P2: Okay.

161
00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:21.500
P2: the sexual orientation question is that

162
00:16:22.938 --> 00:16:28.650
P2: the question asked about your sexual orientation outpatient, or ask about the etc.

163
00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:35.540
P2: for this question here. Not that I'm offended, but

164
00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:43.370
P2: at the same time for me, someone else may feel offended by

165
00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:47.719
P2: you know someone asking them what they sexual orientation is.

166
00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:51.149
Moderator: Oh, can you tell me more about that.

167
00:16:52.100 --> 00:17:04.440
P2: Because it said, all patients are asked about their sexual orientation, so they so their prevention, care to meet your health goals. Well, sometime, I think some people may feel like if

168
00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:11.070
P2: you don't give their sexual orientation, or if they don't, they may be discriminated against.

169
00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:14.999
P2: Because there's so much discrimination going on.

170
00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:19.970
Moderator: Yeah, that's good to know.

171
00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:28.850
Moderator: So you you're saying that even if they select, prefer not to answer.

172
00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:49.679
P2: Oh, well, I was just looking at the questions down here, so I see that. And one of the answers prefer not to answer. So. Yes, I think that should be a personal preference for someone. If they want to answer, they can, but if they prefer not to answer, then they should be, have that option to say, prefer not to answer.

173
00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:51.180
Moderator: Okay.

174
00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:59.530
P2: Oh, now I got a score of one so.

175
00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:06.350
Moderator: Yeah. So now you're done with.

176
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:14.125
Moderator: the screening questions. Before we leave here.

177
00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:18.400
Moderator: Would you mind clicking into one of them again.

178
00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:28.500
Moderator: Let's say you finished before you wanted to, and you realize you selected the wrong button.

179
00:18:28.966 --> 00:18:31.900
Moderator: How would you go back and change your answers?

180
00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:35.859
P2: Okay? Well, the one that

181
00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:48.820
P2: take the sexual sexual orientation one, for instance, if I felt like, I didn't answer that right, I would click on it and expect to see the same questions back up there again.

182
00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:54.379
Moderator: And the same answers, Yeah, is this what you expected?

183
00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:55.340
P2: Yes.

184
00:18:56.490 --> 00:19:10.949
Moderator: Cool, and then let's say you're on the screen. But you wanted help with something on the questionnaire. How would you find help, or like more information.

185
00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:17.539
P2: I would expect to see a help button up here, which I do not see.

186
00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:30.989
P2: so if a help button was up there, it would be able to help me out. Rather, you know, explain something to me better.

187
00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:36.919
P2: or give me a number, so I can call someone, or either chat with someone.

188
00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:45.380
Moderator: Yeah. Where would you? So if you really needed help right now, where would you look.

189
00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:48.810
P2: Up here on the top right hand corner.

190
00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:52.999
Moderator: Yeah, and feel free to click things.

191
00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:57.090
P2: Oh, okay, let's say, change language.

192
00:19:57.610 --> 00:19:59.370
P2: The bill.

193
00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:04.749
P2: The bells say alerts, but it's no alerts in the Pf. Which

194
00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:13.829
P2: profile, message, center report problems, reset, password, and log out.

195
00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:16.509
P2: so I don't see help there.

196
00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:30.640
P2: Oh, and the home button just took me back, so I don't see it where I would look for help. So it's like visible.

197
00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:34.499
P2: So what I would like to see like where say, home.

198
00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:39.730
P2: If a help button is there, I would want it to be like

199
00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:46.839
P2: close to that. So it's self explanatory to let me know that that's where I can go at to get help.

200
00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:50.135
Moderator: Yes, yeah, that makes sense.

201
00:20:51.001 --> 00:21:05.488
Moderator: Well, so that's the end of us going through the questions. And now I just wanna ask you some questions about your overall experience. So can you tell me about your overall impression of this prototype?

202
00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:13.670
P2: My overall experience from what we just did.

203
00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:25.590
P2: And okay. So I just want to get this straight. This supposed to be for me that I have a upcoming and upcoming appointment.

204
00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:38.049
P2: But it has nothing about my appointment, or my health, or any questions. I will want to. Anything I want to discuss with the doctor.

205
00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:43.910
Moderator: Yeah. What would you expect to see.

206
00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:58.254
P2: From a questionnaire for an upcoming appointment I would like to see, am I currently having any problems? Is anything I wanna discuss with the doctor?

207
00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:10.059
P2: not so much about my past medical history because they should. All of that's in the computer any already. So basically, it's like, why am I

208
00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:18.074
P2: doing this particular visit right now? And is there anything I want to discuss with the doctor? Why,

209
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:20.460
P2: Before disappointment.

210
00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:24.620
Moderator: Yeah, let's say, it's just like.

211
00:22:25.922 --> 00:22:32.150
Moderator: general, like, like an annual physical. And these are

212
00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:41.609
Moderator: just like questions that they're asking. So you can do it now instead of when you're in the waiting room or in your appointment.

213
00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:46.799
Moderator: Does that affect how you think of the questions at all?

214
00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:50.769
P2: Well, I mean these questions.

215
00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:58.129
P2: the questions that we just did for me. I don't see where where it has anything to do

216
00:22:58.250 --> 00:23:00.239
P2: with my upcoming appointment.

217
00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.749
Moderator: yeah, that makes sense.

218
00:23:06.723 --> 00:23:11.080
Moderator: And what did you notice about the process of submitting the questionnaire.

219
00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:18.100
P2: It was easy to submit it. Once I submitted, it gave me a score, so

220
00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:21.689
P2: my question would be, What is the score for.

221
00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:30.260
Moderator: Yeah. So on top of that score were there any other parts that didn't match what you thought would happen.

222
00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:43.469
P2: No, everything else was pretty much. What I expected is like. The question was there answered the question, and you know, hit, submit. And the next question came up.

223
00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:46.309
P2: So that was what I would expect to happen.

224
00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:54.700
Moderator: Yes, yes, that makes sense. And then I noticed you scrolling down a bit. Can you tell me what you're seeing at the bottom.

225
00:23:55.240 --> 00:24:07.459
P2: Oh, because I see recommended. So I feel like I'm not finished with the questionnaire, because it's still stuff up under. But it's a recommended. So it's like I would wanna click on them to see what else

226
00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:09.760
P2: the site is offering.

227
00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:15.719
Moderator: Oh, yeah, you can go ahead and click on them, if that's what you would do. After finishing the questions.

228
00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:22.189
P2: Because it could be something important that I missed.

229
00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:26.389
Moderator: Hmm, yeah. Is this what you expected?

230
00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:29.870
P2: No, this is not what I expected.

231
00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:37.369
P2: Like my healthy vet would be logging on to my healthy vet, vet, website.

232
00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:41.439
Moderator: Yeah, what did you expect to see?

233
00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:46.250
P2: I didn't have no expectations of what?

234
00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:52.850
P2: Of what I expected to see, but just to click on it, to see what else was there.

235
00:24:55.070 --> 00:25:01.100
Moderator: yeah, that makes sense. So if we can go back to the previous page.

236
00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:07.170
P2: Okay.

237
00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:14.310
P2: let me see, do I go back up here? Okay.

238
00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:18.010
P2: so I can close close out of the one that open up. Correct.

239
00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:19.450
Moderator: Yes, yeah. Go ahead.

240
00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:27.029
P2: Yes, because it says education and Pm, and R. Exercise exercise resource.

241
00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:41.299
P2: So I didn't read all of this like, I just wanted to click to see what it was, but with this I would be expecting it to give me some information about exercise resources.

242
00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:46.609
Moderator: Yeah, maybe the links just wrong. That's possible.

243
00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:48.580
P2: Yes.

244
00:25:49.040 --> 00:26:00.957
Moderator: Yeah, okay, so how did you feel about using this type of tool to answer questions about your personal health information like, do you feel like it was safe and secure.

245
00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:23.359
P2: Well, it didn't ask me to, and I know this is a an example. But it didn't ask me to log in using like my credentials, so I don't want to answer any questions about my health and everything. If I'm not going to a page that is secure.

246
00:26:24.481 --> 00:26:31.179
Moderator: And that's not asking me for my credentials, because it could be anyone going in there and logging on trying to get information.

247
00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:34.889
Moderator: Yes, that makes sense. So if you

248
00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:39.630
Moderator: logged in with your own information, then you would feel that it's safe.

249
00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:41.170
P2: Yes.

250
00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:50.809
Moderator: Yes, that makes sense. And then what did you think about the length of time to complete the experience? Was it reasonable or unreasonable?

251
00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:54.399
P2: Oh, it was reasonable! It was, I mean, quick and easy.

252
00:26:56.280 --> 00:27:04.810
Moderator: Cool. And then I want to just ask you about those 3 individual like sets of questions.

253
00:27:05.408 --> 00:27:11.890
Moderator: and so you know, based on the layout and formatting of the questions.

254
00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:24.719
Moderator: How easy or difficult was it to answer the question on toxic exposure, let's say, on a scale of one to 5, where one is very easy and 5 is very difficult.

255
00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:26.830
P2: Oh, very easy.

256
00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:34.920
Moderator: So a 1 for the toxic exposure, and then for the questions on homelessness and food, insecurity.

257
00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:37.980
P2: The same thing? Very easy to answer.

258
00:27:38.957 --> 00:27:41.280
Moderator: And then for the sexual orientation.

259
00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:44.100
P2: Same thing? It was easy to answer.

260
00:27:44.610 --> 00:27:46.456
Moderator: Okay, great. And then

261
00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:56.980
Moderator: if you had to interact with this prototype to answer questions about your healthcare on a regular and consistent cases. Basis.

262
00:27:57.672 --> 00:28:00.980
Moderator: How satisfied or dissatisfied would you be.

263
00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:05.210
P2: I'll be satisfied with it, especially if it's this short.

264
00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:09.409
Moderator: So some questionnaires can be overwhelming and long.

265
00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:13.120
Moderator: Yes, yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. So.

266
00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:14.689
P2: Really time, consuming.

267
00:28:15.730 --> 00:28:27.129
Moderator: Yeah, yeah, so relatedly. How does this prototype compare to other questionnaire platforms you've used in the past in terms of like the layout and the interface.

268
00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:34.300
P2: Everything was good. The layout is easy self explanatory.

269
00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:45.450
P2: Down at the bottom where the recommend recommended stuff is at. It's like the recommended stuff is

270
00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:58.840
P2: actually bigger than the stuff at the bottom. I mean, the question is up at the top. So the bottom part, if it's like to me is like, if it's bigger, that is it more important.

271
00:28:59.510 --> 00:29:01.800
Moderator: Yeah. That's a good point.

272
00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:12.079
P2: So it's like, okay, I will be definitely inquisitive to find out as I just was. It's like, Okay, what do they have at the bottom, because this is what's standing out to me.

273
00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:15.533
Moderator: Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.

274
00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:27.409
Moderator: And then also, the way the questions were presented to you, you answered those 3 like types of questions back to back. How do you feel about that?

275
00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:35.600
P2: Oh, they they were easy. It wasn't no problem with the way that they were presented.

276
00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:45.350
Moderator: So is like. It made sense that right after you finish the toxic exposure question, you answered the one about homelessness, and just kept moving on.

277
00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:48.040
P2: Yes.

278
00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:50.020
Moderator: Okay?

279
00:29:51.107 --> 00:29:53.020
Moderator: Cool, I think.

280
00:29:53.720 --> 00:30:01.739
Moderator: One more question, which is, if you could change one thing about this entire questionnaire experience, what would it be.

281
00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:09.719
P2: It would be to put the help button that which is not there put that visible.

282
00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:18.809
Moderator: That makes sense. What kind of help do you imagine you might wanna get.

283
00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:31.329
P2: Okay, well, help for maybe something I didn't understand. So, for instance, if I was doing a toxic exposure and

284
00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:55.819
P2: what I feel like, well, not what I feel like. But what if it was something else would like other exposures? So it's a other exposures. But it's not giving you anything up underneath of that, because some some people may not remember. So if it's a other exposures, it's like, Okay, what are the other options for the other exposures?

285
00:30:56.250 --> 00:30:57.480
Moderator: Yeah, yeah.

286
00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:03.369
P2: And I mean, thank God, burn pit is on here now. But before Burn Pit wasn't on there.

287
00:31:05.277 --> 00:31:07.020
Moderator: What do you mean? It wasn't on there.

288
00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:20.499
P2: Oh, before they came up with, you know the Burn Pit thing. So other questionnaires in the past didn't have anything about the Burn pit. But I know that's something that's been getting a lot of exposure

289
00:31:21.031 --> 00:31:27.780
P2: for the Burn pit. So now it's actually listed like on this questionnaire that you have.

290
00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:31.970
Moderator: Yeah, yeah, that makes sense awesome.

291
00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:42.099
P2: So yeah, so the help button for other exposures. I would like to see a help button there, or a listing of other things, because

292
00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:44.599
P2: you don't know all the time what

293
00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:49.229
P2: your options are, for what else you was exposed to.

294
00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:50.350
Moderator: Yeah.

295
00:31:51.347 --> 00:32:02.039
Moderator: I guess just hypothetically. Let's say you are a person who thinks you might have some other exposure. What would you do on this page?

296
00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:10.739
P2: On this page. Well, it didn't give you an option to do anything else. So if it was a help button up here

297
00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:31.499
P2: and hopefully, the help button will have a phone number or someone you can contact. And you know. So you can actually speak to someone about it. Because that's how things get on these questionnaires is actually by talking to someone. And you know, letting someone else get the information for you.

298
00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:33.120
Moderator: Yeah, yeah.

299
00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:40.039
Moderator: Great. Okay. Before we wrap up. Do you have any questions for me?

300
00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:50.440
P2: No, I don't. I don't have any questions besides doing the questionnaire and everything.

301
00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:50.990
Moderator: Hmm.

302
00:32:51.326 --> 00:32:58.050
P2: The only thing. Well, I have a question, because on my name I'm not sure how y'all have it listed

303
00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:05.159
P2: so, and I know when I logged in it didn't have my name listed. How it is

304
00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:09.800
P2: so I don't know. If I need to change that, or where can I go to change that at.

305
00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:27.179
Moderator: Oh, so this is just a prototype for everyone. It says, Hello, patient. So yeah, it's not tied to you specifically at all. If this were a real experience, and you had to put in your login information, it would say your name. There.

306
00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:28.669
P2: It will have your name there. Okay.

307
00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:30.923
Moderator: Yeah. But this is just our demo.

308
00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:31.950
P2: Okay.

309
00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:41.509
Moderator: A good question. Okay? So before we wrap up, I'm going to ask for those of you who are observing, do you have any questions.

310
00:33:44.550 --> 00:33:46.140
Nina (Notetaker): I'm good. Thank you.

311
00:33:47.410 --> 00:33:49.139
Shawn: I have no questions, but thanks for your time.

312
00:33:50.130 --> 00:33:51.390
P2: Okay. Thank you.

313
00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:55.399
Moderator: Great so if you want to stop sharing your screen.

314
00:33:58.250 --> 00:34:00.250
P2: Just share.

315
00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:02.020
P2: Okay.

316
00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:03.959
Moderator: See that like black bar again.

317
00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:06.630
P2: Stop. Share. Yes. Okay.

318
00:34:06.790 --> 00:34:26.019
Moderator: Yeah, I just want to see your face or make sure you can see my face before we close out. I wanted to say we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on these experiences and make sure they really work for veterans

319
00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:48.729
Moderator: before you go. I also wanted to reiterate that everything we did today wasn't real. And so those questions you answered aren't going to be submitted to anyone. And lastly, you're going to receive a thank you. Note with a little blurb, that you can pass along to other veterans, you know, in order to provide them with the chance to participate in research studies like this.

320
00:34:49.298 --> 00:34:54.260
Moderator: Yeah, thank you so much. Again, rest of your day.

321
00:34:54.489 --> 00:34:56.659
P2: Thank you. Have a good day.

322
00:34:56.659 --> 00:34:58.219
Moderator: Have a good day. Bye.

323
00:34:58.220 --> 00:34:59.200
P2: Bye.
