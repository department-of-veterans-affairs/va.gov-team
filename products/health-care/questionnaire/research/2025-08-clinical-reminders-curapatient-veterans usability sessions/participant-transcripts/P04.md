00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.600
Moderator: Okay.

2
00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:08.630
Moderator: just ask you one more time. So we have it in the recording. Are you comfortable with me, recording my screen and the audio today?

3
00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:10.299
P4: Yes, I am.

4
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:28.540
Moderator: Perfect. Thank you so much. So before we open up this demo tool, just a quick, a few questions for context. Have you ever filled out health questionnaires that you've received from a Va. Provider, either during an appointment or through email or text.

5
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.650
P4: Yes, I have all 3.

6
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:37.639
Moderator: Oh, okay, can you tell me about your experience starting with in person? And then the other 2.

7
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.450
P4: I I I prefer

8
00:00:41.558 --> 00:00:52.719
P4: I don't really like in person. If I'm going to go to appointment, I would much rather have that forms filled out. Prior to that. I'm very anxious, very anxious person. I have a Ptsd.

9
00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.729
P4: so if I'm getting rushed, I probably won't give you.

10
00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:05.500
P4: I want probably fill up the information as correct as as current as correctly, because I feel rushed. I I just

11
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.939
P4: once I get that mode of of going to an appointment and then have to sit down and then fill out the paperwork.

12
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:17.350
P4: I just don't feel I'm giving out the correct information, so I prefer much more getting an email or text

13
00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.489
P4: a week prior. So I can have everything filled out before I get there.

14
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:33.060
Moderator: Yeah, that makes total sense. So for those questionnaires that you've received via email or text like, what devices have you used to respond to them?

15
00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.319
P4: I used to use my phone

16
00:01:37.066 --> 00:01:41.880
P4: but I find it easier to use my computer now.

17
00:01:42.395 --> 00:01:45.314
P4: cause I got a bigger screen. My eyesight's not as great.

18
00:01:45.986 --> 00:02:12.269
P4: I do. Prefer. I would. Maybe suggest you guys have a option. Where? Where would you like to prefer to get a a form to be sent to you via text. I think you guys do that email or in person? I don't know if you guys do that or not, I'm not sure but if you don't do that, I would definitely advise that, and then follow up with a text message saying, Hey, we sent you

19
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.610
P4: a survey to do. What's the status of the survey?

20
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:23.480
Moderator: Yeah, yeah, and would you personally prefer email or text.

21
00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.630
P4: To be honest with you both.

22
00:02:28.635 --> 00:02:32.604
P4: You know as as as you retire, and you and you and you

23
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:43.459
P4: or retiring, you kind of stay off your email. You don't need your computer as much because the phone is so much convenient. But once I see something on my phone. Then I'll come to my computer.

24
00:02:44.163 --> 00:02:53.550
Moderator: So you'd wanna like, get a notification on your phone. But to actually do the form on your computer. It might be easier if you get it through email.

25
00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:00.209
P4: Yes or or simple. I know if you guys can sit both ways. But I I would rather fill out the form now.

26
00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.684
P4: because, you know, I mean to be honest with you to to to fill out a form, you know.

27
00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:18.479
P4: I have a thing called grammarly that everything I do it checks my grammar to make sure that everything is done correctly, because, you know in the past I could write something, and it doesn't make any sense.

28
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.590
Moderator: Yeah, yeah.

29
00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.920
P4: Now, that's that's the reason I use my computer.

30
00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.230
Moderator: That makes sense.

31
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.940
P4: Tool, but but it's a gramm. It's a grammar check.

32
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:36.849
Moderator: Yeah, yeah, so I guess relatedly, when you're on your computer, are you using any accessibility features like a voice over or a zoom.

33
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.276
P4: Yeah, when I do when I when I do when I do

34
00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:49.000
P4: if I have to write out like you know, something long. I'll do it. I'll do it on a on a word document. Use, dictate.

35
00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.660
P4: and then I will grammar, check it, using the word document, and then I will cut and paste it into the form.

36
00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.060
Moderator: Yeah, yeah.

37
00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:26.079
Moderator: that's great to know. Okay, so now we can jump into this demo tool. We're going to pretend that you have a doctor's appointment in a week, and your doctor emailed you some health questionnaires to complete before your appointment. So sounds like you're already familiar with this. These questionnaires may or may not be related to your upcoming appointment, and some of the questions will be familiar to you because you've answered them before.

38
00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.750
Moderator: while others might seem new.

39
00:04:28.312 --> 00:04:39.560
Moderator: So I'm gonna have you as you go through each screen, just think out loud. Tell me what you think about them, and I might also ask you a few questions as you move through them.

40
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:51.390
Moderator: and then just a reminder that your answers are not going to affect you or your benefits in any way. So right now, I'm going to send a link in the zoom chat.

41
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.258
Moderator: There's no need to click it right away. I just wanna make sure that you can see it.

42
00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.310
Moderator: Do you see that a chat.

43
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.990
P4: Yes.

44
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:10.639
Moderator: Awesome. But before you click, I'm gonna ask you to share your screen. So there's this green button at the bottom of your zoom.

45
00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.040
Moderator: it should say share, or maybe it's at the top for you.

46
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.919
P4: This right here. Right?

47
00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.310
P4: Sorry.

48
00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:25.080
Moderator: Hmm.

49
00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.700
P4: How's that?

50
00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.469
Moderator: That's right. It's just loading

51
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:39.800
Moderator: perfect. Okay? So now we wanna open up that link I just sent you you might have like a black toolbar on your screen. It just doesn't show up for me.

52
00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.640
P4: No.

53
00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.519
P4: Do we log in.

54
00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:50.130
Moderator: Do you see a black toolbar on the screen.

55
00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.060
P4: I I'm I'm what I'm seeing is you don't see it up there.

56
00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:55.300
Moderator: No.

57
00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.909
P4: Let me go back to, because let me go. Do this. Hold on a second.

58
00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:00.930
Moderator: Oh, zoom

59
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:09.340
Moderator: automatically makes it so. Only the person sharing can see that control bar but as long as you can see it, that's fine.

60
00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:13.369
P4: I don't see. I don't see a control bar. I see. Sign into your account.

61
00:06:14.012 --> 00:06:14.857
P4: Let me

62
00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.789
Moderator: Oh, okay.

63
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.470
P4: I see signed my account. Let me, I think I think. Can you see it now?

64
00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:29.196
Moderator: Oh, perfect. Okay, let me go ahead. I'm gonna I'm gonna click off this

65
00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:35.156
P4: This link. That's okay. Okay to chat with you. Okay? And let me.

66
00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:41.220
P4: I have a dual monitor. So that's what you're seeing.

67
00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.927
Moderator: It's weird that it says to sign in. Let me

68
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.499
P4: So I'm seeing I'm seeing.

69
00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:51.040
P4: This is what I'm seeing right here.

70
00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.406
Moderator: Yeah, let me give you a different link. Actually,

71
00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:55.340
P4: Okay.

72
00:06:55.340 --> 00:07:04.970
Moderator: Because the way these are supposed to work is that you imagine you get them in your email. And it's a 1 time Link. That's only for you.

73
00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:09.759
Moderator: And so you shouldn't have to log in.

74
00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:11.030
P4: Okay.

75
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.299
Moderator: But I think I might have just given you

76
00:07:14.496 --> 00:07:18.510
Moderator: the wrong link. So let's try this one instead.

77
00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:21.980
P4: And let me go to chat.

78
00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:27.215
Moderator: Oh,

79
00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.910
P4: Then verify, token failed.

80
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:32.050
Moderator: Yeah, that's weird.

81
00:07:33.053 --> 00:07:36.490
Moderator: I'm gonna try and open it on my own computer.

82
00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:43.660
P4: Did you see that that message I got regarding the token.

83
00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:51.970
Moderator: Yeah, it's very funny. I don't know why it won't show up on yours. Cause it is showing up for me.

84
00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:53.220
Moderator: I might.

85
00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:56.199
P4: Can you share your screen? And I can kind of.

86
00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:58.090
Moderator: Yeah, if you don't mind.

87
00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:01.250
P4: Yeah, I could tell you what to do. So let me go ahead and close this out.

88
00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:03.170
Moderator: Okay.

89
00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:06.899
Moderator: And then if you want to share your screen, I'll just tell you what I'm gonna do. Is that okay?

90
00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:11.332
Moderator: That's great. Yes,

91
00:08:14.732 --> 00:08:16.969
Moderator: I'm a little slow at this.

92
00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:17.859
P4: Don't worry about it.

93
00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:19.320
Moderator: Okay.

94
00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:24.380
Moderator: Great.

95
00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:26.050
Moderator: Okay.

96
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.420
Moderator: Do you see this?

97
00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:31.729
P4: Yeah, it's okay. Yep, I see it. Okay.

98
00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:40.040
Moderator: Location. Yeah, okay, so let's imagine that you're able to just click on this link. And

99
00:08:40.737 --> 00:08:53.619
Moderator: see this page, I'm just gonna scroll so you can see the whole thing. And you could just at any point tell me what you're thinking and what you would want to do next.

100
00:08:54.380 --> 00:09:00.560
P4: Okay, I would. What I'm thinking is, I would probably go start clinical reminders.

101
00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.159
P4: And I would say yes to this.

102
00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:24.910
Moderator: Okay. Oh, I also wanted to add, as we're going through, we're not really trying to get feedback on specific wording, cause you will see a lot of questions. But what we're most interested in is the kind of like layout of the different screens.

103
00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.129
P4: Okay. Okay.

104
00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:29.953
Moderator: The like interface. How like the buttons

105
00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:34.879
Moderator: And the different like features are in the page.

106
00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:38.609
P4: I would I would I would. This looks great. I would go. Yeah.

107
00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:43.490
Moderator: Perfect. So you'd click. Yes, okay.

108
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:50.670
Moderator: I'm also just going to, I think, hide my toolbar so you can see more. Let me see if I know how to do that.

109
00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:52.870
P4: That's okay. I, it's okay.

110
00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:55.900
Moderator: Good. I'll just okay.

111
00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:56.820
P4: Their guardian.

112
00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:00.080
Moderator: Okay.

113
00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:00.870
P4: And hard.

114
00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:02.250
Moderator: Okay.

115
00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:06.831
Moderator: Oh, sorry. I started scrolling.

116
00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:13.410
P4: All right, I would look at this and and click what's apple to me?

117
00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:21.659
Moderator: so you don't have to tell me your real information. But just let me know what you'd want to click.

118
00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:24.160
P4: Just say bird pits.

119
00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:25.420
Moderator: Okay.

120
00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:33.629
Moderator: So here, okay, anything, unclear or unexpected here.

121
00:10:35.382 --> 00:10:38.390
P4: No, I would. Click next.

122
00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:39.390
Moderator: Okay.

123
00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.390
P4: We'll hit, confirm.

124
00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.069
P4: You would say. I don't have any questions at this time.

125
00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:15.680
Moderator: Okay, and also let me know if you want me to scroll faster or slower.

126
00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:17.070
P4: It is useful for us. Yeah.

127
00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:18.040
Moderator: Okay.

128
00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:25.450
P4: Okay, I would go okay and submit.

129
00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:35.990
P4: Yes, I'm living in stable housing.

130
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:38.290
Moderator: Okay.

131
00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:47.680
P4: Okay. I would scroll down.

132
00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:52.860
P4: Often true.

133
00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.250
P4: often true.

134
00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:06.780
Moderator: Okay.

135
00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:24.920
Moderator: So let's say you, this is our hypothetical scenario. Just got a phone call from a friend. And it's important you need to take it right now, but you know this call will probably take a while, so what would you do next?

136
00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:28.569
P4: I would minimize the screen.

137
00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:32.840
Moderator: Okay. So I'll pretend that I'm minimizing it.

138
00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:35.820
Moderator: Or I'll just actually.

139
00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:41.959
P4: Then hopefully, I would. I would. Is there? I would say we

140
00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:48.869
P4: it, I would say. Is there a way for me to maybe go back to save, or you know I would see there if there was like a save at any time.

141
00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:49.760
Moderator: Oh, okay.

142
00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:50.970
P4: When you get back to him.

143
00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:53.259
Moderator: How would you try and save.

144
00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:58.830
P4: I would probably go to maybe my, my, my profile.

145
00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:04.708
P4: and say, even does it have save? No, it doesn't. I would go with. I would go

146
00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:11.800
P4: I would. I would check all the buttons. What I would do, what I personally did. I would go across the buttons.

147
00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:14.030
P4: go to each button. See if there's a save function.

148
00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:15.590
Moderator: Like.

149
00:13:15.861 --> 00:13:17.490
P4: On the toolbar, on the toolbar.

150
00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:18.440
Moderator: Oh, okay.

151
00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:20.670
P4: The Black 2. I go to home.

152
00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:25.426
P4: If yours it's a save, and maybe

153
00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:39.270
P4: well, it I would say right there, and I said I would look at this, I would go to complete it. August 5.th I go to the Arrow down to topics, so I would go there and see if it opens up to my

154
00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:42.180
P4: okay. Then I would just quit.

155
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:45.509
P4: So I would log back. So that that's telling me that

156
00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:47.970
P4: it shows me where I stopped.

157
00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:53.220
P4: you know, because I'm a computer person. So I would say, Okay, I just, I'll just log back in when I'm done.

158
00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:54.909
P4: and see if that takes me there.

159
00:13:55.180 --> 00:14:07.589
Moderator: Great. Okay? So let's pretend you finish your call. Then you log out, you log back in. So now you're back at your homepage. And what would you do next.

160
00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:10.610
P4: Are, you know, toxic disclosure, screening, clinical reminder.

161
00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:18.759
P4: and then I would. I hit next.

162
00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:23.169
P4: I'd go next again.

163
00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:24.800
Moderator: Yeah, I did that already.

164
00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:30.599
P4: And then I think I did this already. Go back. Confirm, keep going next.

165
00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:39.960
P4: Okay, this is a little confusing.

166
00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:43.560
P4: because there's not a way to get out of the menu, so I would go to the home button.

167
00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:44.860
Moderator: Okay.

168
00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:49.439
Moderator: So can you tell me what was confusing?

169
00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:56.189
P4: I think, the very last part. This is confusing the very, very last part, because it really doesn't tell you.

170
00:14:56.790 --> 00:15:02.900
P4: You know it doesn't give you examples. I just did send you, it should say, can you actually go back there again? Please.

171
00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.340
Moderator: Yeah, I'll just click through.

172
00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:06.939
P4: Click through all the way.

173
00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:12.359
P4: I would say there should be a button here, says end of

174
00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:15.560
P4: there should be set. It should say that

175
00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:22.319
P4: it should tell you right there, the buttons to hit finish. You should have a finish button here if you hit. Okay.

176
00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:22.900
Moderator: Yeah.

177
00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:24.120
P4: What should come open

178
00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:27.559
P4: and you can finish it. And you're done. And you know that you're gonna get the email.

179
00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:29.990
Moderator: Yeah, yeah, so I think.

180
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:34.470
P4: There should be a finish button right there. Once you click that on there, hit that. Okay, button

181
00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:41.320
P4: a finish button should click on, and then it just said, When you when you're finished, click on the finish button or done.

182
00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:45.940
Moderator: Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. Okay, but.

183
00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:48.450
P4: Just got it. Just kind of leaves you there.

184
00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:50.109
P4: What do I do next?

185
00:15:50.416 --> 00:15:57.459
Moderator: Yeah, so given that it's like this, you said you would click the home button and then what would you do next?

186
00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:01.819
P4: I was, I would go to my profile, log out.

187
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:03.730
Moderator: Oh, okay.

188
00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:08.750
P4: But I'm saying that the screen prior to that I would.

189
00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:12.910
P4: I would like to see a finish button, and then, once I finish it, it should close you out.

190
00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:13.770
Moderator: Yeah.

191
00:16:14.114 --> 00:16:17.210
P4: Unless you have other things you have to do.

192
00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:28.069
P4: So. If I have to do the homeless and food and security clinic reminder, then that should that should take me back to the screen. If I don't have anything more to do, then it should close me out.

193
00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:29.450
Moderator: Yeah, yeah.

194
00:16:30.535 --> 00:16:37.230
Moderator: So let's say, in this scenario, you're expected to complete the whole page.

195
00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:41.519
P4: I would go the next one. That's I would go to the very next one homeless.

196
00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:43.179
Moderator: So you'd click right here.

197
00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:48.290
P4: Yeah. And but I don't see a button so that maybe I'm kind of like, maybe it would work. Maybe it won't.

198
00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:50.750
Moderator: Yeah. So nothing's working right here.

199
00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:53.479
P4: So I would. I would slide down, see recommendations.

200
00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:55.220
Moderator: Okay.

201
00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:59.119
P4: And if I wanted to do any of these things I would click on this.

202
00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:03.520
Moderator: Okay, I can click on this.

203
00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:05.869
P4: Maybe I would click on it just to see what it is.

204
00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:08.690
Moderator: Do you see this new tab.

205
00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:10.020
P4: Yeah.

206
00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:12.340
Moderator: Yeah, was that what you expected?

207
00:17:13.754 --> 00:17:19.589
P4: I expected more probably, of what they what they asked. The last tabs I was seeing.

208
00:17:20.319 --> 00:17:21.629
Moderator: Yeah, okay.

209
00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:26.057
P4: Like. If you go back there I would see something like that. That.

210
00:17:26.599 --> 00:17:29.270
P4: maybe I would. You know I would do.

211
00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:32.069
P4: maybe put external links on this.

212
00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:33.986
Moderator: Oops. Sorry I clicked it by accident.

213
00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:38.739
P4: It's it's just there. It will help. But I would put maybe you go into external links.

214
00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:41.570
Moderator: Like you'd put as a title.

215
00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:44.759
P4: Yeah, yeah, recommendation. External links.

216
00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:46.280
Moderator: Yeah, yeah.

217
00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:49.150
P4: That way, you know. You're getting out of that page.

218
00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:53.125
Moderator: Yes, yes, okay.

219
00:17:54.600 --> 00:18:08.210
Moderator: So for the sake of making sure, we look at all these questions. Let's say you were told in your email, you had to do these 3 clinical reminders.

220
00:18:08.822 --> 00:18:10.640
Moderator: So what would you do next?

221
00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:17.419
P4: Well, I would click on this click reminders. But right now it's telling me it's unavailable, but it assuming that these

222
00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:20.839
P4: these screens are available. I would click on those click reminders.

223
00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:28.219
Moderator: Yeah. So given that when you click here it doesn't work. Is there another place you would try to click.

224
00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:31.360
P4: I would do the the little hands.

225
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:34.840
P4: I'll go over to the left, right there.

226
00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:35.470
Moderator: Yeah.

227
00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:43.610
P4: On that I would go that little line. I'd click on that, and I'd say, Oh, well, they don't have anything. Maybe I'll go down and start clinical reminders

228
00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:45.569
P4: again. Let's see what they have there.

229
00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.924
P4: Oh, alright! Well, that's that's

230
00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:54.350
P4: Those go back to screen.

231
00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:56.620
Moderator: Yeah. How would you go back.

232
00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:03.409
P4: I would go. That would go very top of the. But my, my up up keyboard. Okay, those should be green.

233
00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:08.159
P4: and they say available when I get a reminder. Those should be green.

234
00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:11.539
Moderator: Like this should be green like these are.

235
00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:14.549
P4: And that should say due date that should say available.

236
00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:16.550
Moderator: Yeah.

237
00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:19.069
P4: Like, or or maybe a different color.

238
00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:27.720
P4: Not knowing to go. I'm just saying I know how web pages work. Now I'm talking for people that not really computer savage.

239
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:30.970
P4: But they're not going to know that to start cleaning reminders again.

240
00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:39.410
Moderator: Yeah. So just to make sure I know what you're saying. This looked like it was unavailable because

241
00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:43.289
Moderator: gray, it says unavailable, and you couldn't click on it.

242
00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:46.170
Moderator: Yeah, yeah. So and.

243
00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:49.400
P4: But if I go to the start, start clinical reminders, it's available.

244
00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:50.480
Moderator: Yeah.

245
00:19:50.640 --> 00:20:00.830
Moderator: So if you were doing this without me at your home, if you were on this page you clicked on this, it didn't work. What would you do next?

246
00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:04.400
P4: Well as a computer person knowing

247
00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:21.490
P4: pages, knowing the web pages, how they design, I would click everything I could possibly do. But as a person that does not very smart with computers. I would leave this page. And hopefully, I get, they think I'm going to get an email from saying, click on this link to complete your other surveys.

248
00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:24.180
Moderator: Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.

249
00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:31.030
P4: So I'm giving you 2 answers me as who I am, but as a really client, that somebody is older person that doesn't know computers.

250
00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:33.230
P4: they could get very lost here.

251
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:39.019
Moderator: Definitely. Yeah. So you would click around and keep trying to figure it out. But definitely.

252
00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:46.340
Moderator: if somebody else who is less computer, savvy was looking at this. Just leave. That's good to know.

253
00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:48.649
P4: I would click on, start clinic reminders.

254
00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:50.919
P4: And then I would go through. Yes.

255
00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:55.599
P4: but I did. I answer this before? I would kind of ask my question. Did I answer this before.

256
00:20:56.460 --> 00:21:00.790
Moderator: You did. Yeah. So what do you think happened?

257
00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:03.599
P4: I don't know. Could I not save it?

258
00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:06.759
P4: I'll go through it again.

259
00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:08.100
Moderator: Yeah.

260
00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:20.830
P4: So it's just not giving my score. There. See? I see I'm seeing something right now. See the score down there. Go ahead and hit often. True.

261
00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:26.270
P4: Okay, it's only scored me one.

262
00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:28.430
P4: If you go back or previous.

263
00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:34.189
P4: Maybe it's just a click in the web page. See? Right there should that score me a 1.

264
00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:36.420
Moderator: Oh, yeah.

265
00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:42.570
P4: So I'm just telling you as a web developer and homework. I see this. I'm going Whoa!

266
00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:45.310
P4: Next.

267
00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:49.680
P4: That could be the problem that that did not register the thing. Let's go ahead and go next.

268
00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:51.959
Moderator: Yeah. Oh, it's not working.

269
00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:03.170
P4: I would I would refresh the button of the the go next to the up to the web. The web

270
00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:06.160
Moderator: Browser up very top respect.

271
00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:09.000
P4: Yeah, refresh.

272
00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:14.129
P4: That's what I would do and see where. Maybe maybe I just default.

273
00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:18.700
P4: Did I hit that again? I'd hit live in a stable house and say, yes.

274
00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:22.800
P4: they hit next. So it was just a glitch in the system.

275
00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:25.300
Moderator: Like. Do it again. Go down here.

276
00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.579
P4: It's that one often true.

277
00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:34.660
P4: Next offer true and hit. Submit.

278
00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:37.860
P4: The only thing the other thing is.

279
00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:43.909
P4: when you went back, go ahead. We'll finish it. I'll talk what I'm talking about. Go ahead bring it down.

280
00:22:45.928 --> 00:22:51.360
P4: I don't. I don't think this is done in your your guys business. I don't think why we're asked these questions.

281
00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:56.870
P4: I. Another thing I don't care for is, why are you asking me if I'm a male or female.

282
00:22:57.866 --> 00:23:12.229
P4: My name is [redacted PII], and and I'm going. I'm getting checked for my testosterone levels, or you know, maybe I have an issue with my something wrong with my body. I just that. That's just my overall side. I don't know why we

283
00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:16.309
P4: we're asking what our preferences are and and who we are, and

284
00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:23.220
P4: for male or female, or we need American or we black or white, it doesn't really matter. We're humans. We're all the same thing.

285
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:28.040
P4: That's something that probably is not about this about this per se.

286
00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:33.930
P4: But I just don't. I think we're far beyond that anymore, especially if

287
00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:37.490
P4: I'm doing a survey for my doctor. She knows who I am.

288
00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:42.390
P4: She doesn't need to know that, and plus if I am bisexual.

289
00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:47.129
P4: or a lesbian or gay, I may not give you the correct answer.

290
00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:54.000
P4: I'm afraid that I may get somebody that's not going to accept that but

291
00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:58.259
P4: I would say I would say, straight.

292
00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:02.480
P4: Submit

293
00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:13.210
P4: what I would do

294
00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:20.640
P4: just for the heck of it. This is this is me. I would go back to the sexual orientation clinic reminder.

295
00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:27.100
P4: And I would click in that. I'm lesbian or gay, and I would see what happened to the screen.

296
00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:29.370
P4: Does it ask me different questions.

297
00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:31.840
P4: I would say that I would do.

298
00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:34.060
Moderator: It's not letting me click.

299
00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:49.569
P4: Okay, that's what I would do, maybe because I click it. But I would say, Well, why are they asking these questions? They're concerned about my health. Okay? Well, maybe there is a reason why they're asking these questions. But maybe there's other medical issues that I should be. They should be looking at. If I pick other

300
00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:51.270
P4: answers.

301
00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:52.440
Moderator: Yeah.

302
00:24:53.247 --> 00:24:54.380
Moderator: What would you.

303
00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:57.810
P4: And that's true, that up top.

304
00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:02.460
P4: If that's true, then I would put that in there, that

305
00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:11.110
P4: if I would put it there that you know, we're asking you questions because we're I think you kind of say, anyways. But

306
00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:13.110
P4: but

307
00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:21.959
P4: yeah, I would probably put some there that we're asking. There may be different. Health concerns that we may, we may ask, if you answer it differently.

308
00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:24.969
Moderator: Yeah. And you think this isn't clear enough.

309
00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:30.560
P4: Yeah, I don't think well, it does say that. But

310
00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:35.559
P4: yeah, it's clear now, I and I, usually you know what I don't really.

311
00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:39.210
P4: hardly ever read those such, or why am I answer these questions?

312
00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:44.159
P4: There's so much in there, so maybe maybe bowl that.

313
00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:45.880
Moderator: Yeah.

314
00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:51.459
P4: Oh, and it probably reason I want you to change it because you've been scored already.

315
00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:53.650
Moderator: Yeah, yeah.

316
00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:55.729
Moderator: So what would you do? Now?

317
00:25:56.957 --> 00:26:03.130
P4: I would I would. I would just go through it and hit next, because I went back. And I yeah, I would say.

318
00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:05.839
P4: can we go back to that button?

319
00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:07.750
P4: Because I answered it already.

320
00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:12.780
P4: No, I've got the home button. Yeah, that that. And then I would say, Okay, I'm done.

321
00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:17.430
Moderator: Okay. So when you're done, you just what would you do?

322
00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:21.735
P4: And close out. I would go to my

323
00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:24.479
P4: I will go down the page first.st

324
00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:29.970
P4: Go down the little sidebar. It's and maybe see why there's the. Then again.

325
00:26:31.050 --> 00:26:39.810
P4: there should be finish. There should be something on here saying, finished or done here, because sometimes people don't know to go to your profile and hit log out.

326
00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:47.300
P4: or I would close out the the web, tab the chat itself.

327
00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:55.520
Moderator: Yeah, yeah, that sounds good. Okay, so I'm gonna go ahead and close that like you would.

328
00:26:56.730 --> 00:27:05.220
Moderator: And then I just wanna ask you a few questions about that whole experience. So already had a lot of great feedback.

329
00:27:06.546 --> 00:27:14.159
Moderator: And now I want to ask what was your overall impression of the prototype.

330
00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:16.609
P4: Oh, the prototypers!

331
00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:21.429
P4: My thing is, is that just the the initial

332
00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:24.449
P4: questionnaire? And this is gonna be something I have to answer all the time.

333
00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:31.219
P4: Or is this kind of our our secure, messaging Va thing that we're we're talking about replacing.

334
00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:41.220
P4: And this is, gonna be kind of our questionnaires that we're gonna always ask you about and if we're gonna be asking the same questions over and over again.

335
00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:58.850
Moderator: So you might get these at a regular cadence. But the different sets of questions some you might get like once a year, some you might get every few months. So, depending on what you're kind of due to answer before your appointment, those are the ones you get.

336
00:28:01.030 --> 00:28:06.000
P4: I would say that overall. The overall vision of that is is yeah.

337
00:28:06.130 --> 00:28:10.120
P4: we've always said anything in in software planning.

338
00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:13.870
P4: If it's more than 3 mouse button clicks. You're gonna lose the customer.

339
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:18.249
P4: So if I have to keep clicking, a lot of mouse clicks to do my thing.

340
00:28:18.410 --> 00:28:22.260
P4: I think that you guys have plenty of mouth. You guys are perfectly on the mouse clicks.

341
00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:26.810
P4: There's not yet to finish it. You have to hit, you know you got check one.

342
00:28:27.170 --> 00:28:29.080
P4: and then you gotta go next

343
00:28:29.790 --> 00:28:33.989
P4: so that. But you're not doing a bunch of different mouse clicks, which is good.

344
00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:42.850
Moderator: Cool. And then, what did you notice about? Again, like the process of submitting the questionnaire.

345
00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:45.770
P4: Easy scholar, one to 10, very easy.

346
00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:47.310
Moderator: Okay.

347
00:28:48.610 --> 00:29:13.269
Moderator: Similarly, I wanted to ask for each of those sets of screeners how easy or difficult it was to answer, based on the layout and formatting of the question. So I'll ask you, one by one, on a scale of one to 5, where one is very easy and 5 is very difficult. How easy or difficult was it to answer the toxic exposure set of questions.

348
00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:14.030
P4: One.

349
00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:21.240
Moderator: Okay. And then how easy or difficult was it to answer the homelessness and food, insecurity? Questions.

350
00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:22.500
P4: What?

351
00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:26.280
Moderator: Okay? And then for the sexual orientation question.

352
00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:28.570
P4: Warm.

353
00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:31.079
Moderator: Okay? And do you want to expand on your answer?

354
00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:34.369
P4: The one thing I do wanna do. And this this is.

355
00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:41.230
P4: you're not involved. You're you're probably involved in the design of the of the platform itself.

356
00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:46.279
P4: But the question is, if you're homeless, you're definitely going to be asking for food.

357
00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:47.819
P4: So why are we?

358
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.029
P4: If I don't? I don't know if that would have clicked if I would have said No, I'm homeless with the food question came up.

359
00:29:54.920 --> 00:30:00.709
P4: Because if I'm homeless, obvious, I'm on the streets, and I'm probably begging for food.

360
00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:06.449
Moderator: So could you tell me more about how that would change.

361
00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:14.130
P4: I would. I would think that if if you're homeless, I think that that would should that should. If I say I'm homeless, that should be the answer right there.

362
00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:18.419
Moderator: Hmm! So you shouldn't have to do the extra food insecurity.

363
00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:21.999
P4: If I answer homeless now, I could be living in a home.

364
00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:30.279
P4: and the question is good question that, are you living at home? You're not homeless. But are you having problems getting food? That is a very good question.

365
00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:41.930
P4: Just apples and oranges. I just think, if you're homeless and you should know that automatically. Hey? Okay, they they fit both questions, or maybe ask that question, you know, if it yeah, that's what I feel.

366
00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:42.840
Moderator: That makes sense.

367
00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:44.060
P4: But it was easy.

368
00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:52.300
Moderator: Great. Okay, and then, was there anything that stood out, or you weren't sure about.

369
00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:55.170
P4: Yeah, if I'm homeless, how? How do I have a computer.

370
00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:56.740
Moderator: Hmm.

371
00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:07.450
Moderator: yeah. But let's focus on you specifically. And your experience going through the prototype because we're talking to a wide range of people. So we want to know.

372
00:31:07.450 --> 00:31:08.250
P4: Right.

373
00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:09.640
Moderator: Your experience.

374
00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:11.889
P4: Yeah, they're very easy.

375
00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:13.130
Moderator: Okay.

376
00:31:13.594 --> 00:31:22.419
Moderator: and then, how do you feel about using this type of tool for questions about your personal health information like, did you feel like it was safe, secure.

377
00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:29.679
P4: That? That was a question I kind of asked myself. You really didn't ask any

378
00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:35.140
P4: help questions at all. I mean, that made me that this kind of expose me.

379
00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:35.930
Moderator: Hmm.

380
00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:42.340
P4: So I felt very safe. Now, if you're asking me, you know you know what what it?

381
00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:51.259
P4: I wanted to be a secure site if I were to. If you ask me about my my health as in, you know. What kind of medication you're taking.

382
00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:57.710
P4: What's the diagnosis, you know, are you schizophrenics, or you? But you know you've got Ptsd

383
00:31:58.321 --> 00:32:02.669
P4: that kind of. So I would be kind of concerned if it wasn't a secure site.

384
00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:07.389
Moderator: Yeah, and what would make you feel like it was a secure site.

385
00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:10.359
P4: A login somehow. Login.

386
00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:14.830
P4: I like the login.gov

387
00:32:15.695 --> 00:32:19.820
P4: like you do when you secure messages. So I think once I I'm in there.

388
00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:21.870
P4: I know I'm secure.

389
00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:25.350
P4: If I get a password on my phone.

390
00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:28.689
P4: it says, Hey, you know this log, this code to get into the site.

391
00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:29.949
P4: I know it's security.

392
00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:31.160
Moderator: Tractor.

393
00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:34.129
P4: Yeah. 2 factors. Yes. Syndication. Yes.

394
00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:40.640
Moderator: Yeah. So how do you feel about that? Like one time? Use link that's emailed directly to you.

395
00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:43.899
P4: Anything, on the questions.

396
00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:47.940
Moderator: So if you.

397
00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:51.300
P4: If it if it's if it's if they're homelessness and

398
00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:55.440
P4: toxic exposure is a question I ask. I have no issues at one time. Login.

399
00:32:55.630 --> 00:33:04.709
P4: you know, log in like I logged in myself with a password, and and then not asking for a security back, you know, 2 2 factor authentication.

400
00:33:04.930 --> 00:33:06.200
Moderator: If you're asking personal.

401
00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:09.149
P4: Well, medical questions, and I'm 1 of 2 factor.

402
00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:10.120
Moderator: Yeah.

403
00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:10.960
P4: Does that make sense.

404
00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:12.420
Moderator: Yes, yes.

405
00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:17.070
P4: For these questions. No, I don't think it was really needed, but, on the other hand, some people may

406
00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:19.640
P4: may request that for me no.

407
00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:33.960
Moderator: Yeah, yeah, that's good to know. And then, how did this prototype compare to other questionnaire platforms you've used before? Because you mentioned filling this out over email before over text.

408
00:33:35.290 --> 00:33:38.000
P4: It seems a lot easier, and a lot streamlined.

409
00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:41.979
Moderator: Oh, okay, could you tell me more about those past platforms?

410
00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:44.370
P4: Well, you know, it's a lot of times we got forms.

411
00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:55.679
P4: There's a lot of writing in there. There's a lot of writing in the forms regarding the form, the the revision number it has a bunch of other stuff that's in there, like, you know.

412
00:33:55.810 --> 00:33:59.050
P4: this is your guardian, or whatever I do. So there's a lot of stuff in there

413
00:33:59.250 --> 00:34:20.470
P4: that really doesn't pertain to what you're what you're answering the form, but it kind of gets gargled in your mind when you see this form, and you got this long form, and all you gotta do is basically read something, sign it. But you got this long form, and you have all this information. I just did one for the I just did one for the Social Security Office, and it was just.

414
00:34:20.679 --> 00:34:22.800
P4: I'm getting all these papers here.

415
00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:24.019
Moderator: Oh no!

416
00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:25.603
P4: All it was was just

417
00:34:26.469 --> 00:34:28.710
P4: It was all it was was just sign the form.

418
00:34:29.679 --> 00:34:33.989
Moderator: Yeah, so so that is, you're saving paper. Obvious?

419
00:34:34.659 --> 00:34:57.289
P4: And and you know, there's not a lot of stuff. And this is talking about the program. And you know, the security type in what's gonna happen, what you know. It's what to do if you have any questions. Blah blah but it's and I got a whole package of it, you know. Just kind of mail. When I all I needed was to sign a form, fill out a document like yours. Check check. I'm done. This is very streamlined.

420
00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:05.239
Moderator: Yeah, yeah, it's good to know. So those previous forms you received for health questionnaires. Those were like Pdfs.

421
00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:07.359
P4: Yeah, pdfs, yeah.

422
00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:09.079
Moderator: With the like boxes.

423
00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:14.229
P4: You know what boxes you check it, and and it just but there's a lot of nonsense in there. You know what I mean.

424
00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:23.550
Moderator: Yeah. Let's say that in this platform there needed to be for like.

425
00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:32.979
Moderator: if if people want more information about why the questions being asked. If they wanted to know where they could go to get help. Where would you want that information to be stored.

426
00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:34.910
P4: And that should be in my profile.

427
00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:36.790
Moderator: In your profile.

428
00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:38.830
P4: And we see a profile that says help.

429
00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:42.909
P4: So I go to my profile. It goes. What about? You know my profile.

430
00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:51.759
P4: you know more phones have your profile and you log into it. It has your name, your account number maybe stuff like that. Maybe a little help button right there, says, Help.

431
00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:52.790
Moderator: Yeah.

432
00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:57.420
P4: And then an email for contact and a phone number, I,

433
00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:02.819
P4: I don't know if you guys want to have an online help person for these forms, because.

434
00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:09.699
P4: as you, if you've been in help desk before, some people are just not computer savage. So if they get this and they don't know how to open it up.

435
00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:15.070
P4: There should be a button there. It says, you know, for online help or chat, click on that.

436
00:36:15.370 --> 00:36:16.480
Moderator: Yeah, yeah.

437
00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:20.029
P4: Ask a question about, hey? I'm really uncomfortable about

438
00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:29.829
P4: putting out that I'm an actual homosexual, or I'm gay. You could say no. The reason we're doing this is because there are different medical questions we need to ask you. If you fall underneath that

439
00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:39.170
P4: or there's other programs that we we can offer to you to help you out with these situations versus just nothing there. So I would say, probably a chat or help.

440
00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:40.630
Moderator: Yeah, yeah.

441
00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:43.349
P4: It could be. It could be an AI Chat function.

442
00:36:43.822 --> 00:36:47.049
P4: you know. It just automatically answers the question for you.

443
00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:52.910
Moderator: Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. And then.

444
00:36:54.280 --> 00:37:12.529
Moderator: yeah, if you had to interact with this prototype to answer questions about your healthcare on a regular basis like before each appointment. How satisfied or dissatisfied would you be from a scale of like very dissatisfied, dissatisfied, satisfied, very satisfied.

445
00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:14.579
P4: I said, very satisfied.

446
00:37:14.970 --> 00:37:15.790
Moderator: Okay.

447
00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:18.925
P4: And the other interiors are but

448
00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:25.570
P4: to to my recommendation for this platform would be if

449
00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:28.359
P4: I get an email the day prior to my appointment.

450
00:37:28.690 --> 00:37:35.740
P4: I would say all those questions they ask you in your appointment, which takes 2030 min before you see the doctor.

451
00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:53.749
P4: Why can't I just answer those online. And then when you come in there, you could say, Okay, those questions you answer. I see that you filled your survey. Is there any changes to your survey like you're paying, or this or that that way, we could close that gap and get more patients in through the facility if they answer the stuff online.

452
00:37:54.130 --> 00:37:58.600
P4: and it just makes it a smoother process.

453
00:37:58.850 --> 00:38:02.100
P4: I don't, you know. When you go into doctor's office they ask you a bunch of questions.

454
00:38:02.410 --> 00:38:02.790
Moderator: Yeah.

455
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:15.610
P4: Can I have this all done, prior, on going there and then, like the paint pain thing, you know, you can say, okay. Somebody's question you asked. But is there anything else on there? You want to add? How should you paying today is any different than what you answer on the form.

456
00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:17.630
Moderator: Yeah, yeah.

457
00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:22.529
P4: But I would think, having this information filled out prior to you, and that nurse gets it before she sees you

458
00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:24.160
P4: would would be great.

459
00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:27.589
Moderator: Yeah. Could you share more about? Why, it would be great.

460
00:38:28.310 --> 00:38:30.600
P4: Well, because I think we're we're saving time.

461
00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:34.140
P4: you know. I I really don't care about seeing the nurse.

462
00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:37.720
P4: My focus is to see the doctor, and if I'm in there

463
00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:41.229
P4: having all this, all these questions being asked by my nurse.

464
00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:44.809
P4: that could be more time I could be spending with my doctor.

465
00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:46.910
P4: Thanks for joining on

466
00:38:47.410 --> 00:38:54.189
P4: now. There's some things like my weight, my blood pressure, you know my my pulse, and all that, that's all get done there, but

467
00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:56.719
P4: just to save a little time, I think would be nice.

468
00:38:57.050 --> 00:39:06.899
Moderator: Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. Last question. If you could change one thing about the entire questionnaire experience, what would it be.

469
00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:16.200
P4: Well with the nothing. Really? No.

470
00:39:18.570 --> 00:39:23.519
Moderator: Cool and do you have any questions for me?

471
00:39:24.110 --> 00:39:24.760
P4: No.

472
00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:51.770
Moderator: Awesome. Okay? Well, that is all we have for you today. We really appreciate you taking your time to share your thoughts with us. This is so helpful to us as we continue to work on these experiences and make sure they really work for people before you go. I want to reiterate that everything we did today wasn't real. And so the questions you answered aren't going to be submitted anywhere or to your provider or anything.

473
00:39:51.930 --> 00:40:04.249
Moderator: And then, lastly, Perigan's going to send you a thank you note, and it'll include a little blurb that you can pass along to other veterans, you may know, to provide them with the chance to also participate in research.

474
00:40:04.250 --> 00:40:05.550
P4: I'll do that.

475
00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:06.029
Moderator: Thank you.

476
00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:08.170
P4: Okay, all right. Thank you very much.

477
00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:10.199
Moderator: Thank you very much. Have a great day.

478
00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:11.319
P4: You too. Bye, bye.

479
00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:12.160
Moderator: Night.
