Moderator: Great, and so that we have it in the recording I want to confirm. Are you comfortable with me, recording my screen and audio today?

2
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:11.080
P6: Yes.

3
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:28.810
Moderator: Great. Okay? So before we go into this demo tool, just a couple of like intro questions, have you ever filled out health questionnaires that you've received from the Va. Provider, either at your appointment or through email or text.

4
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.370
P6: Yes.

5
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.699
Moderator: Okay? And can you tell me about your experience?

6
00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:47.920
P6: I think the questionnaire that I received was that got it in the mail after an appointment asking me about the doctor and the appointment.

7
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:49.740
Moderator: Oh, okay.

8
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.780
Moderator: How?

9
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.330
P6: And I have done some that was medical

10
00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.589
P6: like. For instance, I just had an appointment that was for

11
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:08.010
P6: that was scheduled through the Va. But it was outside, and I did have to do a medical questionnaire for a mammogram.

12
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.789
Moderator: Oh, okay. And what was that experience like? Was it in person or.

13
00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.529
P6: No, the questionnaire. They sent it to me on by email.

14
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:41.330
P6: And I had to go in. And I actually had to do it before the appointment they wanted to do like a background on my medical history asking questions about different things as far as my health and my family history medical background because of it was being for a mammogram. I guess that's to see if anybody ever had any type of cancer or anything.

15
00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:48.419
Moderator: Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. And just to just so, I remember, was that through the Va or another provider.

16
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:55.819
P6: It was an outside provider, but the Va. Referred me out to that provider.

17
00:01:56.246 --> 00:02:03.499
Moderator: Got it? Okay? And when you responded to that questionnaire, did you use your phone or computer.

18
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.889
P6: I use my phone.

19
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.830
Moderator: Okay, do you use any accessibility features on your phone?

20
00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:10.939
P6: No.

21
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.099
Moderator: Got it. Did you experience any difficulties completing that questionnaire?

22
00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.399
P6: No, it was pretty simple and easy.

23
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:44.060
Moderator: Got it. Okay. So now, today, we're going to pretend that you have a doctor's appointment coming up in 2 days and your doctor similarly emailed you some health questionnaires to complete before your upcoming appointment. And so these questions may or may not be related to your upcoming appointment, and some of the questions might be familiar to you, because you've answered them before, while others might be new.

24
00:02:44.200 --> 00:03:02.435
Moderator: And I'm going to have you as you reach, read each screen. Just think out loud. Tell me what you think of it, and I'll also prompt you with a few questions as we go through it. Just a reminder. This is a prototype. So your answers aren't going to affect you or your benefits. And

25
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.200
Moderator: what device are you using for this call?

26
00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.199
P6: I'm using my mobile phone.

27
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.589

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:11.760
P6: Android.

29
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.269
Moderator: Got it just in case we have any issues, then I'll be able to help troubleshoot

00:03:17.822 --> 00:03:26.590
Moderator: so in the zoom chat, I'm going to put a link but no need to open it yet. I just wanna make sure that you can see it.

P6: Okay.

32
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.299

00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:00.169
Moderator: If you open that link, I just wanna be able to see that web page when you share.

40
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.999
P6: Oh, okay, open the link.

41
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.759

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:51.079
P6: I am. I'm trying to find the tools that's at the bottom of the page where you can share. But being that, I brought this page up. I don't. Well, I guess I can go back to it.

46
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:52.680
Moderator: Yeah, are you?

47
00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.130

P6: Hmm!

52
00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:25.269
P6: Once I click the share, and it brings up what I want to share, where? Actually, what you want to share.

53
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
P6: So how would I do that? If I have the page open it? How would I share it?

54
00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.619
Moderator: Yeah, so are you on the zoom screen.

55
00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.050

Moderator: Okay? So at the very bottom, there's that share button.

57
00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:53.340
Moderator: And then there should be a bunch of options, and one of them says, screen.

58
00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:12.350
Moderator: Okay? And then, oh, I think you can't actually select a specific screen. I think you might have to share your phone screen in general, since it's android. Is that okay? With you? I can give you time to X out any windows if you like.

59
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.820
P6: Okay, let's see here.

P6: and it brings up all these different

65
00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:23.519
P6: it don't actually bring up the screen that's opened.

66
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.560
Moderator: Like. Are you still start recording or casting with zoom? Enter, screen.

Moderator: Oh, Zoom has disabled this option!

69
00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:50.789

P6: screen came up and said, start recording a casting with zoom. Enter screen

76
00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:33.159
P6: when you're sharing, recording and casting zoom has access being visible on your screen. So I hit start.

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:34.059
Moderator: Yeah.

Moderator: Thank you.

88
00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:08.610
Moderator: I hope that I think that should be the hardest part.

89
00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:09.750
P6: Yeah.

90
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:10.849

P6: It's the toxic exposure, screener homelessness and food, insecurity.

97
00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:15.070
P6: tobacco. So I guess this would be if if one of these things may be dealing with you. Then this is what you would

98
00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:21.120
P6: talk about, or this is what the clinical is going to be talking about dealing with.

99
00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:30.800

100
00:10:31.338 --> 00:10:40.740
Moderator: And for some more context. There's no login, because this is one of those one time links. That is only for you.

101

107
00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:29.960

Moderator: Okay. So now, we're gonna do a brief scenario before you continue. Imagine that you just received a call from your friend while you're in the middle of filling out the questionnaire, and you

156
00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:59.870
Moderator: it's an important call. So you know, you're going to be busy for the next like 30 min. What would you do next?

157
00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:05.999
P6: I would tell my friend I would have to call them back, because I'm in the middle of doing something.

158
00:16:06.955 --> 00:16:10.384
Moderator: Let's say it's really important. So you have to take the call.

159
00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:17.679
P6: Okay, I'll take the call, and I'll find out real quick what's going on. And if it's an emergency

160
00:16:18.108 --> 00:16:25.889
P6: and I just have to do something. Then I guess I will go ahead and do it. But if it was an emergency, then I continue with the questionnaire.

161
00:16:26.361 --> 00:16:30.280
Moderator: And what would you expect to happen when you return back to the question.

162
00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:39.489
P6: It would probably be have gone away because you stayed away from it. It was, how do you call it? No activity for a certain period of time.

163
00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:46.570
Moderator: Hmm! So would you expect? Your progress to be saved, or would it? You have to start from the beginning again?

164
00:16:47.625 --> 00:16:51.579
P6: I would probably have to start from the beginning again.

165
00:16:53.210 --> 00:17:03.279
Moderator: so we can't. Make you time out in the middle of this call and so to pretend that it happened I'm, gonna have you close this

166
00:17:04.005 --> 00:17:16.769
Moderator: window and open it up again so it you won't have to change your share screen. All you do is X out this window and then click the link again inside the zoom, chat.

167
00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:21.470
P6: Okay. X, out this window.

168
00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.160
P6: Hmm.

169
00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:39.260
Moderator: Oh, so you same button that you click the 3 at the top.

170
00:17:39.812 --> 00:17:43.200
P6: That's what I thought. Just x out the one page I'm on.

171
00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.350
Moderator: Yes, perfect.

172
00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:46.270
P6: Okay. Alright. I did that.

173
00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:50.669
Moderator: And then if you could go back to the zoom.

174
00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:58.659
P6: There we go!

175
00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:00.340
Moderator: Yeah, Hello!

176
00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:05.799
Moderator: And so there should be at the bottom the chat.

177
00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:09.290
P6: Click.

178
00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:11.140
Moderator: Perfect.

179
00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.268
Moderator: Okay. So now we're back.

180
00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:15.230
P6: Avenue.

181
00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:17.269
Moderator: Is this what you expected to see?

182
00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:20.310
P6: Yes, at the beginning of it.

183
00:18:22.035 --> 00:18:23.989
Moderator: So what would you do next?

184
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:26.940
P6: I was click start clinical reminders.

185
00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:30.409
P6: And of course you gotta start all over.

186
00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:35.150
Moderator: And how do you feel about that.

187
00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:36.560
P6: Well.

188
00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:43.620
P6: I feel I feel okay about it, because I figured if I stayed away from it too long it was going to go away, and I have to start all over again.

189
00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:58.330
P6: That's the way most things are when you're in the middle of like, if you're doing a questionnaire or anything, if it doesn't tell you in the beginning that it will be saved. Then you should know that if you stay away from it too long you're gonna have to start over.

190
00:18:58.630 --> 00:19:08.860
Moderator: Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. Thank you for going through that scenario with me. And now feel free to continue going through the questions.

191
00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:09.990
P6: Okay.

192
00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:29.139
Moderator: So before we move on to the next set. How did you feel about that? Those last 2 pages.

193
00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:31.960
P6: Oh, they were fine! Not a problem.

194
00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:46.180
Moderator: And then let's say that you needed help with something on the questionnaire like there is a word you didn't understand, or something. Where would you look to find help?

195
00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:53.899
P6: If that was a word I didn't understand, I would probably try to Google. It.

196
00:19:54.715 --> 00:20:00.670
Moderator: Okay, or let's say you wanted help with something specific to the questionnaire.

197
00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:07.099
P6: Then I would contact see who I could contact to answer the questions.

198
00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:11.630
Moderator: Yeah, and where would you want to find that contact information.

199
00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:22.510
P6: I would probably go back to the beginning of this and see if there were contact information listed on that page.

200
00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:26.259
Moderator: Okay, so how would you go back to the beginning.

201
00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:29.270
P6: Let's see.

202
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:39.170
P6: let me see here, reminder. Let's see what this is at the top.

203
00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:48.819
P6: instead of hitting the back key. Okay, that's language. So I would have to go back, just hit the error key and go back.

204
00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:54.729
Moderator: What arrow key did you click.

205
00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:58.699
P6: The bottom one, and that takes me all the way out.

206
00:20:58.700 --> 00:20:59.960
Moderator: Oh, the bottom right.

207
00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:10.659
P6: Yeah, like, I don't see. Yeah, I don't see anything else that I could get out go backwards to. And it took me back to the very 1st page.

208
00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:11.990
Moderator: Hmm.

209
00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:17.000
P6: And it doesn't say anything anything on here about contact information.

210
00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:21.959
Moderator: Yeah. So if it were on this page, where would you want to see it?

211
00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:24.080
P6: Well, I did

212
00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:31.821
P6: click the little white square box at the left hand corner at the top, and it's only got

213
00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:36.910
P6: image patient 8.

214
00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:53.869
P6: He was that whatever. I guess that was that you probably could contact somebody there. But you would have to send a message because it only shows profile, reset, password, message, center, or report a problem.

215
00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:03.829
Moderator: yeah, is there any feedback you have for that process?

216
00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:11.930
P6: Well, I would say they need to have some type of way to contact them. Or

217
00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:13.769
P6: if you have

218
00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:23.559
P6: certain questions about something. Sometimes, you know, they put on there frequent asks questions, or something like that, or area for that.

219
00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:31.189
Moderator: Hmm, yeah. What would you do if this is all you saw? And you had a question.

220
00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:33.140
P6: Oh.

221
00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:42.040
P6: if I had a question, and that's all I saw, I pretty much would try to just go on and answer the question to my best of my ability.

222
00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:48.139
Moderator: Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. What do you think that message center is.

223
00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:55.509
P6: Message center. Oh, I don't know. I would click on it and see.

224
00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.899
Moderator: Yeah, he said, Yeah.

225
00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:06.439
P6: It says, an okay, A/C, complete your assessment 6 h ago.

226
00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:07.730
P6: Hmm.

227
00:23:10.985 --> 00:23:13.659
P6: yeah, that's all it says.

228
00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:18.010
Moderator: Yeah, what would you want to see there instead.

229
00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:24.320
P6: Maybe a way to contact someone, a phone number, or

230
00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:27.259
P6: you could type a message and leave it.

231
00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:32.550
Moderator: that sounds good. Okay,

232
00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:39.410
Moderator: thank you. And let's go back and go through the rest of the questions.

233
00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:40.210
P6: Okay.

234
00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:51.709
P6: it says, loading.

235
00:24:03.277 --> 00:24:06.340
Moderator: What would you do if this happened.

236
00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:12.280
P6: Sign in to your account. Huh?

237
00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:14.619
P6: Where did that come from?

238
00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:18.262
Moderator: Oh, I guess it logged you out

239
00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:19.850
P6: I guess so.

240
00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:27.120
Moderator: Yeah. So what would you do now?

241
00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:29.130
Moderator: Since you don't have a username or password.

242
00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:35.999
P6: I will go all the way out of it and try to go in again.

243
00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:39.139
P6: and it's still bringing the same thing up.

244
00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:40.570
Moderator: Hmm.

245
00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:41.640
P6: Yeah.

246
00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:51.289
P6: it says, sign in or sign in with the BASS. O. Sign in with the BASS. OII don't even know what that is.

247
00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:53.170
Moderator: Yeah. Yeah.

248
00:24:54.295 --> 00:25:01.744
Moderator: Well, that is a bug that you've just found. So that's very all for us. Now.

249
00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:02.850
P6: Okay.

250
00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:24.429
Moderator: I think that I have. I'm actually not sorry. I'm not sure if this is the username and password but I can copy paste for you, and we'll just see if it works if it works. If it doesn't, that's okay. Because there's actually only one more question. In here.

251
00:25:26.272 --> 00:25:27.840
Moderator: Let me see.

252
00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:37.899
Moderator: Okay. So the patient name is or the username, I think, is.

253
00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:44.570
Moderator: All caps, EIGH t.

254
00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:55.940
Moderator: And the password is what you saw in that screen. It's all caps image, so I am

255
00:25:56.090 --> 00:26:06.100
Moderator: a GE. And patient, so PATI ENT.

256
00:26:07.178 --> 00:26:09.469
P6: Let's see if that works.

257
00:26:13.302 --> 00:26:19.629
Moderator: Okay, never mind. That's okay. We can just have you stop sharing screen.

258
00:26:20.812 --> 00:26:27.605
Moderator: Thank you for finding that bug. We gotta replace and

259
00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:36.580
Moderator: yeah, no worries there. Was only one question left, anyway. And

260
00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:44.879
Moderator: let me see if this link works on my computer. I wonder if it has something to do with being on a mobile phone.

261
00:26:46.649 --> 00:26:54.809
Moderator: Oh, no, the links just not working anymore. That's weird. Well, I don't want you to have to

262
00:26:55.550 --> 00:27:01.033
Moderator: go through all of those questions again. So we'll just avoid.

263
00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:11.040
Moderator: We'll just avoid that last one. All it was was a question of what is

264
00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:17.370
Moderator: I don't actually know how it's worded.

265
00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:23.439
Moderator: What? What? What is your like sexual

266
00:27:24.603 --> 00:27:34.170
Moderator: identity? And then it says, like cis slash heterosexual lesbian slash gay

267
00:27:35.344 --> 00:27:38.789
Moderator: queer, and prefer not to answer.

268
00:27:39.404 --> 00:27:45.180
Moderator: Yeah. So from that. Do you have any feedback on that question?

269
00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:49.389
P6: Hey? I'm straight. I don't have a problem answering that question.

270
00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:51.190
Moderator: Cool.

271
00:27:51.946 --> 00:28:00.879
Moderator: Thank you. And then I just have some questions about that overall. Experience. Now.

272
00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:07.689
Moderator: So okay, can you tell me about your overall impression of the prototype.

273
00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:17.152
P6: It was pretty nice until we ran into the problem where it

274
00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:21.920
P6: it kicked me out and asked me for it to sign in.

275
00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:27.239
P6: and then I had no idea what to do, because I didn't have a username and password.

276
00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:28.379
Moderator: Yeah. Yeah.

277
00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:32.279
P6: Once I was while I was in. Everything worked pretty well.

278
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:40.949
Moderator: That's helpful to know. And so what did you notice about the process of submitting the questionnaire before the logout happened?

279
00:28:42.652 --> 00:28:49.110
P6: I noticed that after I finished the 1st part about the cigarettes at the end it asked me to confirm.

280
00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:53.390
Moderator: Hmm, yeah. How did you feel about that?

281
00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:58.859
P6: Well, that's a good thing to make sure that your answer was what you said it was. They're confirming it.

282
00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:01.440
Moderator: Oh, so you think it's good that they asked you to.

283
00:29:03.490 --> 00:29:08.129
Moderator: I think they should confirm for more questions.

284
00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:15.080
P6: I guess it could go either way.

285
00:29:16.735 --> 00:29:19.919
P6: Maybe at the end

286
00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:36.899
P6: it kind of puts me in a mind of when you vote, and once you finish voting it, bring up a the whole thing, and ask you to over to look over it, to make sure your answers are answered, and it's what you selected, and that's confirming it.

287
00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:38.440
Moderator: Yeah, yeah.

288
00:29:39.448 --> 00:29:40.762
Moderator: That makes sense.

289
00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:47.810
Moderator: okay. And then, were there any parts as you went through the questionnaire that didn't match what you thought would happen.

290
00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:48.815
P6: No.

291
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:59.989
Moderator: And how did you feel about using this type of tool to answer questions about your personal health information like, did you feel like it was safe and secure.

292
00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:01.490
P6: Yes.

293
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:02.900
Moderator: Okay,

294
00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:06.610
Moderator: And what made you feel like it was safe.

295
00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:13.879
P6: Hey? It's the way of the world. That's the way they pretty much do everything now, so you might as well get used to it, and get comfortable with it.

296
00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:21.929
Moderator: Yeah, yeah. Okay. What do you think about the length of time it took to complete the questions.

297
00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:25.910
P6: I feel that it was good. It didn't take that long to do it.

298
00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:39.020
Moderator: Cool and then you said that you previously filled out an email questionnaire. So how does this prototype compare to that or other questionnaire platforms you've used in the past.

299
00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:46.979
P6: I would say it was shorter, because the other one, like I did for my mammogram. It was long.

300
00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:55.430
Moderator: Hmm, yeah, and then besides the length, we're still really interested in the like layout. And then.

301
00:30:55.430 --> 00:31:06.410
P6: Oh, the layout! The layout was good. Pretty much. All the ones that I've dealt with the layout is simple. It's easy to understand. It's not complicated.

302
00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:13.759
Moderator: Okay, cool. And if you could change one thing about the entire questionnaire experience, what would it be.

303
00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:17.750
P6: For this or any questionnaire.

304
00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:19.710
Moderator: About this one specifically.

305
00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:24.230
P6: I guess I would say.

306
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:35.200
P6: to have a place to go, or someone that you can contact when you have a problem. If if there's something in the questionnaire that you don't understand.

307
00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:46.530
Moderator: Yeah, and would you want that to be like a real person like an a frequently asked question section, or like something else?

308
00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:55.600
P6: Probably a frequently asked question, because it's probably gonna be hard if you're doing a questionnaire online to actually speak to somebody.

309
00:31:56.347 --> 00:32:00.830
Moderator: or like some places have those like AI chat, bots. Now.

310
00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:02.590
P6: Right? Yeah. The chats.

311
00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:07.850
Moderator: Yeah. So what would you prefer between that? And like a frequently asked question.

312
00:32:08.438 --> 00:32:14.169
P6: I've used it before, and I have no problem with it. The chat group is fine.

313
00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:16.999
Moderator: Okay, but no like preference.

314
00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:25.420
P6: I would say the chat, because you can ask what specific question you want to ask.

315
00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:47.489
Moderator: Okay, that's helpful. And then I want to go back and ask about those like sets of questions that you had. So there is the toxic exposure questions. There are the homelessness and food insecurity questions. There are the tobacco. Use questions. And then there's that last sexual orientation question.

316
00:32:47.520 --> 00:33:05.819
Moderator: and for each. I'm going to ask how easy or difficult it was to answer those topics. So one is very easy and 5 is very difficult. So on a scale of one to 5. How easy or difficult was it to answer the toxic exposure? Questions.

317
00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:07.929
P6: That's been very easy.

318
00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:14.240
Moderator: Okay? And how about the homelessness and food, insecurity? Questions.

319
00:33:15.610 --> 00:33:16.400
P6: Is.

320
00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:23.430
Moderator: Okay? And then for the tobacco. Use questions.

321
00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:25.530
P6: It was easy, too.

322
00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:31.080
Moderator: Okay? And for the sexual orientation question.

323
00:33:31.756 --> 00:33:35.419
P6: It was easy for me, but others that may not.

324
00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:49.070
P6: They may not feel that it's easy, because but they give you a choice of what you want to do if you want to answer it, if you do not want to answer it. So I would say, it's still easy, because you can select whichever one you want.

325
00:33:50.045 --> 00:33:50.850
Moderator: Yeah.

326
00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:55.330
P6: Like you're required to answer it. It gives you an option.

327
00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:56.830
Moderator: Yeah, yeah.

328
00:33:57.260 --> 00:34:11.309
Moderator: Okay. And last question, if you had to interact with this prototype to answer questions about your healthcare on a regular and consistent basis. How satisfied or dissatisfied would you be.

329
00:34:12.449 --> 00:34:13.949
P6: I'll be satisfied.

330
00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:15.150
Moderator: Okay?

331
00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:18.609
Moderator: And that's helpful.

332
00:34:19.144 --> 00:34:22.930
Moderator: And before we close, do you have any questions for me?

333
00:34:23.389 --> 00:34:25.389
P6: Nope, -

334
00:34:25.389 --> 00:34:30.469
Moderator: And then [notetaker] Do you have any questions.

335
00:34:31.259 --> 00:34:32.779
Notetaker: Thank you very much.

336
00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:57.619
Moderator: Okay, great. So we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us. Your feedback is so helpful as we continue to work on these experiences and make sure they really work for veterans before you go, I want to reiterate that everything we did today wasn't real. So the questions that you answered were not submitted to your provider or anywhere else.

337
00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:12.150
Moderator: And lastly, Perigan, who set up this call, is gonna send you a thank you. Note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other veterans, you might know to provide them the chance to participate in research studies like this.

338
00:35:12.455 --> 00:35:18.249
Moderator: And then thank you so much. Again, and I hope you really enjoy the rest of your day.

339
00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:20.039
P6: Thank you. You. Do sign.

340
00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:21.670
Moderator: Thank you. Bye.

341
00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:22.800
P6: Bye-bye.
