Moderator: Okay. So I just started recording. And so that it's in the recording I'd like to confirm, are you comfortable with me recording my screen and audio today?

2
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.529
P10: Yes, ma'am, I am.

3
00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:17.390
Moderator: Great so before we go into that demo just a couple of

4
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.060
Moderator: background questions. Have you ever filled out health questions.

5
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.739
Moderator: health questionnaires from your Va. Provider, either at an appointment or through email or text.

6
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.739
P10: Not that I recall.

7
00:00:31.134 --> 00:00:34.290
Moderator: So these are like the sort of

8
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:41.989
Moderator: questions you answer. Maybe in the waiting room, or even in person during your appointment. Have you ever had those.

9
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.820
P10: I have.

10
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.420
Moderator: Okay? And

11
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.730
Moderator: between those 2. Have you had them in the waiting room, or just like during your appointment?

12
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.389
P10: In the waiting room.

13
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.740
Moderator: Okay? And can you tell me about your experience with that.

14
00:00:57.281 --> 00:01:09.198
P10: Usually it's been X-rays, Mris, for mammograms and that kind of stuff to, you know. Background history, that kind of thing.

15
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:22.179
P10: and then, if you know, if I have fallen and broken a bone, or something like that, they kind of ask more about that specifically because of my age. So, but that's about it, and it I don't have. It doesn't happen very often.

16
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:35.890
Moderator: Got it. Okay, that's good context. And so today, we're going to pretend that you have a doctor's appointment in 2 days. And your doctor has emailed you some health questionnaires to complete before your appointment?

17
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:46.539
Moderator: And so these questions may or may not be related to your upcoming appointment, and some of the questions might be familiar, because you've answered them before, while others might be new.

18
00:01:46.730 --> 00:02:00.560
Moderator: And I'm going to have you. As you see, each screen. Just tell us what you think. Read out loud what you're seeing, and I might also, or I will also have some additional questions for you as we go through.

19
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:01.670
P10: Okay.

20
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.490
Moderator: And so oh, I know

21
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:11.849
Moderator: I need to find the link again, because I was looking at all these how to fix zoom articles so one second.

22
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.730
Moderator: okay.

23
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.400
Moderator: so I just wanna make sure that you see this in the chat. But no need to click on it yet.

24
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:23.630
P10: Okay.

25
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.530
Moderator: Do you see a link in the chat now.

26
00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:27.850
P10: Yes, I do.

27
00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:38.450
Moderator: Okay, great and before you click on that, I'm gonna ask you to share your screen and so on your computer. It should be this green button at the bottom of your zoom.

28
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.530

29
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:50.370

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.800
Moderator: Do you see any zoom stuff pop up for you?

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:07.860
P10: Let's see here, it's real hard to see, because it's all up to as top as they can get.

72
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.199
Moderator: Yeah. So it's not in the black toolbar.

73
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.422

74
00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.960

78
00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.950
Moderator: Yeah, I think you want to try and get out of the black.

79
00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:40.560
P10: Yeah, I am trying. I'm I'm trying to get yeah. It's not letting me out as much as it's hiding everything. So I've gotta just

80
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:50.449
P10: let me real careful, so I can see which one it is. Those are so high up it won't. It won't let me show participants and content.

81
00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:56.809
Moderator: Yeah. So one thing you could do is at the very, very top right of your screen.

82
00:05:57.725 --> 00:06:01.830
Moderator: Near where there's the minus button, and there's an X button for your.

83
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.639
Moderator: You could just do the middle one.

84
00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.770
Moderator: So instead of minimize the just make your browser slightly smaller.

85
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.459
P10: Oh, okay, well, I don't know what it means

86
00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.139
P10: then, at least now you can see the tabs.

87
00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.610
P10: Okay, let's see here, let me.

88
00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:20.070
Moderator: I know.

89
00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:24.319
P10: Audio, video participants, chat, share, pause.

90
00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:29.010
Moderator: Or you want to ignore the black toolbar, and you just want to look at your browser window.

91
00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:31.150
P10: What's the browser window.

92
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.759
Moderator: Yeah. So the you just clicked it.

93
00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.600
Moderator: That button you clicked was the top of the.

94
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.250
P10: Oh, okay.

95
00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:42.499
Moderator: Big gray box that has the web page in it.

96
00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:46.649
Moderator: Yeah. So right now, you just want to close the tab you're on.

97
00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:49.246
P10: Okay. So I'm on

98
00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:51.750
Moderator: Yeah, perfect. That's.

99
00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:52.240
P10: Terrific.

100
00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.049
Moderator: I don't want to be on.

101
00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:54.190
P10: Hello!

102
00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.660
Moderator: And if you could just move that back up.

103
00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:01.189
P10: There, there we go. Okay. Gotcha.

104
00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.869
Moderator: Perfect and could you click, allow?

105
00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:10.100
Moderator: Thank you. Just so. The pop ups not in the way.

106
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:10.580
P10: You can.

107
00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:40.440
Moderator: So now now, things should be easier. This is the home page of the demo and as I said before, we're gonna pretend that you have a doctor's appointment, and they sent you this link. It's a 1 time Link, just for you. So that's why you didn't have to log in and now I'm going to ask you to pretend, like you have to complete all of these screening questions before your appointment.

108
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:49.459
Moderator: And so before you continue on through all of these questions, I just want to ask, what are your 1st impressions of this page?

109
00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:52.470
P10: I like it. It looks organized.

110
00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:54.970
Moderator: Okay. Can you tell me more.

111
00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:58.379
P10: Well, I mean, because it's not. It's not messy.

112
00:07:58.720 --> 00:07:59.115
Moderator: Hmm.

113
00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:05.039
P10: To me. It's direct and it's explanatory. It explains itself.

114
00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:08.299
P10: you know. So I get what it's saying

115
00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:14.319
P10: that makes any sense. But it looks even sharp, and ready to go.

116
00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:20.499
Moderator: That's helpful. Okay? So now you can go ahead and answer the questions.

117
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.340
P10: Okay.

118
00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:28.700
P10: okay.

119
00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:32.869
P10: I clicked on toxic exposure screen.

120
00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:43.199
Moderator: Yeah, nothing's happening so if I weren't here, what would you try to do next?

121
00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:51.530
P10: I would I would talk to the to the nurse, or somebody in the office to get me some help, because I am not electronically inclined.

122
00:08:52.297 --> 00:09:00.360
Moderator: So how would you figure out who to talk to? If this is something you're doing at home before your appointment?

123
00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:11.489
P10: I would call if I would call them. And usually they have, you know, on the Internet, a some way to get in touch with a person to try to get this done, and all right, hang on to it and have brought it in.

124
00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:17.000
Moderator: Yeah, yeah, is, how would you try and find that phone number?

125
00:09:17.879 --> 00:09:32.119
P10: Well, it was real easy with the Va system. Actually. You just go ahead and call the main switchboard and then find out what clinic or group this is at, and then ask them for that number, and talk to them.

126
00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.840
P10: Okay, that is what I would normally do.

127
00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:42.040
Moderator: Yeah, let's say, you have a question about like this website specifically.

128
00:09:42.725 --> 00:09:48.824
Moderator: how would you? Or where would you want to try and find information about

129
00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.089
Moderator: getting help on this website.

130
00:09:51.090 --> 00:10:07.730
P10: Well, if we're doing it with the website and stuff, I try to figure out who put it out and then ask for the technician or the technic people that that did the pages that can that can answer those questions.

131
00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:20.570
P10: Okay, and but I and but I will tell you I am not a very big fan of things that break down over and over again. I it! It. It frustrates me.

132
00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:28.870
P10: and it confuses me, and then it upsets me. Cause if I'm trying to do something that has been requested of me.

133
00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:34.379
P10: and I can't find somebody to help. Then I have a problem.

134
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:39.050
P10: Okay, yeah, I can't help it. I'm I'm built that way, you know.

135
00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:39.490
Moderator: That makes.

136
00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:47.600
P10: So, but not being able to to find somebody to help me with something that they wanted me to do. That's a big no, no in my

137
00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:49.130
P10: big no-no.

138
00:10:49.420 --> 00:11:11.580
Moderator: Yeah, so how do you feel about? I don't know if you've seen this on a website before. There are lots of different ways on a website to get help. Sometimes there's like a frequently asked questions. Sometimes there's a chat bot in the corner. Sometimes there's a phone number just listed

139
00:11:12.053 --> 00:11:16.299
Moderator: that you can call what would you want to see in this site?

140
00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:18.209
P10: Absolutely none of that.

141
00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:18.976
Moderator: Oh, okay.

142
00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:36.770
P10: I mean honestly, 40 years experience, trying to to deal with the Va. And get my health care done and get questions, answers, and trying to do what is quote best for me. If I am unable to get in contact with a person.

143
00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:55.780
P10: After at least 20 min of trying to get in touch with whoever does the the web page, whoever does set it up and they have. You know, they've got technos. And yeah, they do have people with the phone. And then you have to spend 2030 min waiting for somebody to pick up the phone.

144
00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:00.770
P10: yeah.

145
00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:14.939
P10: You know, it has to be. It has to be faster than that. Somebody should be able to pick up. The phone will be with you whenever and go forward. If they're too busy, then give me a number of who whom I can speak.

146
00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:29.909
P10: Yeah, when it comes down, and I and I and I hate to say it. I've had the experience, and ruffles my feathers more than I can tell you. It really does, especially since I am not computer literate.

147
00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:31.230
Moderator: Yes, yes.

148
00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:39.030
P10: Okay, that's that makes it even worse. And then I have to call my husband because he is. He's a geek, and he can figure it out.

149
00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.879
Moderator: Yeah, but.

150
00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:44.180
P10: You know, like I said it when it goes down.

151
00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:50.089
P10: - there should be somebody there to help me resolve as soon as possible.

152
00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:56.269
P10: because I am that important and anybody else that uses this is that important.

153
00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:57.179
Moderator: Yes, yes.

154
00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:00.520
P10: So, yeah, that's how I see that.

155
00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:11.697
Moderator: That's that is very helpful to know. That's great context. And I will say that what you've identified here is a bug like

156
00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:13.880
Moderator: And

157
00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:26.499
Moderator: yeah, it is confusing that you aren't able to click this button. And so I'll just tell you so that we can move forward with the questions. That there's like another button on the screen.

158
00:13:26.953 --> 00:13:28.220
Moderator: That will take you through.

159
00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:29.720
P10: Okay.

160
00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:36.200
Moderator: So, yeah, if if you look to the bottom of that list of 4.

161
00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:36.780
P10: Yeah.

162
00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:37.950
Moderator: Button there.

163
00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:40.989
P10: Okay, do we want? Do we want the next button?

164
00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:41.700
Moderator: Yes.

165
00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:42.510
P10: Okay.

166
00:13:43.566 --> 00:13:48.180
Moderator: So the black button says, start clinical reminders.

167
00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:51.169
P10: Okay, the black button. Where is this? Oh, okay.

168
00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:52.710
Moderator: Bottom. Yeah.

169
00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:55.300
P10: Yeah, okay, that's the one you want me to click right?

170
00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:59.290
Moderator: Yes. Yeah. How do you feel about that?

171
00:14:01.073 --> 00:14:07.180
P10: I think it could have been more concise than that, actually, you know. But

172
00:14:08.917 --> 00:14:19.069
P10: like again, I I do the best I can to navigate something that's never going to go away, which means I have to adapt, and I can do that with help.

173
00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:26.749
P10: Okay, so but when I'm if I'm misreading something, it's frustrating.

174
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:33.629
P10: But that's me. I mean, that has nothing to do with a program as much as.

175
00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:37.060
P10: and I hate to say it. But I'm I'm I'm

176
00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:46.119
P10: I'm getting older, and it's you know they're here to stay. And I I was, I was around before the Internet was even invented.

177
00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:46.680
Moderator: Me!

178
00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:55.000
P10: We are, so I gotta accept it. But I want I want to learn how to use it.

179
00:14:56.260 --> 00:15:04.910
P10: Okay, because it's not always. It's not always the the the web page, the setup, or whatever

180
00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:22.571
P10: on its defense, and even hate to say that part. It's the user's problem that I'm not doing what needs to be done. And I need to be educated. Oh, that's a good way to do that, you know. If you could, if if they want me to do something else, do a

181
00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:33.430
P10: a pamphlet, or something to help, teach me how to maneuver the web page that would cut off and cut out a lot of frustration.

182
00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:36.010
P10: you know, because it's lack of knowledge.

183
00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:41.799
P10: you know. I don't understand what's going on. So I'm doing the best I can with what I got.

184
00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:50.280
P10: Yeah, definitely, so yeah, education is is a big deal. It really is.

185
00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:54.850
Moderator: Definitely education, a clear introduction

186
00:15:55.020 --> 00:16:05.849
Moderator: would all be very helpful. At the same time, we do want to try and make this set of questions as easy as possible, so as many people

187
00:16:06.387 --> 00:16:19.930
Moderator: can fill it out without needing to call someone. So as we go through this, if you do see something you're like that doesn't really make sense to me. Or I really didn't expect that to happen. That's what we really want to know.

188
00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:20.950
P10: Okay.

189
00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:22.879
Moderator: So if you see something

190
00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:29.785
Moderator: I won't be offended at all. Tell me like that doesn't make sense. How is I supposed to know that

191
00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:30.740
P10: Right

192
00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:36.180
Moderator: Okay. So now, we can just go ahead and move through these questions so

193
00:16:36.863 --> 00:16:41.990
Moderator: you can feel free to read them out loud, if you like, or just tell me what you think after you read.

194
00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:48.409
P10: Okay, let's see here, minus there we go. Yes.

195
00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:52.750
P10: Okay. And then I hit. Next.

196
00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:59.770
Moderator: Yeah, and tell me, before you move on to the next question. If there's ever anything confusing.

197
00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:00.850
P10: Oh, okay, Gotcha.

198
00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:05.380
P10: I was expecting more than one question actually.

199
00:17:06.109 --> 00:17:06.669
Moderator: Yeah, okay.

200
00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:11.590
P10: That's that's my bad. Okay? You think you're supposed to none.

201
00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:20.179
P10: Okay, none. Where are you at? Okay, airborne. Nope, Nope, Nope, Nope.

202
00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:24.149
P10: okay. And I can leave those just blank and check. Just check next.

203
00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:26.920
Moderator: Is that what you'd want to do.

204
00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:30.790
P10: Yes, ma'am, cause I haven't. I was not exposed to any of that.

205
00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:34.629
Moderator: So you did have an exposure, but it's not listed here.

206
00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:36.170
P10: Right? I think, so, yeah.

207
00:17:36.854 --> 00:17:44.519
Moderator: Okay, that's good feedback cause. The way this is organized is that you actually do have to click one of these in order to move on.

208
00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:46.090
Moderator: Yeah.

209
00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:50.810
P10: Something. Okay? Well, I I can, because I wasn't look. I can't.

210
00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:52.939
Moderator: Yeah. So what

211
00:17:53.930 --> 00:18:00.050
Moderator: would you want to be able to type in the exposure that you had like? You know what it is.

212
00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:01.570
P10: Yes, yes.

213
00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:02.190
Moderator: Okay.

214
00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:05.669
P10: There's more more exposures out there than this.

215
00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:06.940
Moderator: Yeah.

216
00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:20.169
P10: Okay, I mean a whole lot more. So. But yeah, I would like to be able to say, you know, exposed 0 or or some way to pass that on. But yes, you know

217
00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:26.039
P10: not experience right here, and just I haven't. I wasn't exposed.

218
00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:26.795
Moderator: Hmm,

219
00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:28.640
P10: Way to know that.

220
00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:34.080
Moderator: Yeah. How would you try to move on then, if I weren't here?

221
00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:56.199
P10: I'd probably go back. I'd probably try to answer questions. Well, but I wouldn't even do that, because that would be lying. Okay. But I would try to get help from somebody that can either, like a teacher and say, Okay, this is not. This is not solid. It's not valid. You need to pass me through it, because I can't check it.

222
00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:59.530
P10: You see, it's it's not.

223
00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:05.329
P10: I cannot push a button.

224
00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:06.940
P10: That is not true.

225
00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.100
Moderator: Yeah.

226
00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:12.179
P10: Know, and what I do with veterans

227
00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:25.309
P10: as I help them with their claims and stuff. We don't do. We don't do, invalid. If you've been exchange experienced Agent Orange, then? Yes, if you have not, then you have not.

228
00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:31.809
P10: then we figure out what it is that did cause what's going on so I can't.

229
00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:36.179
P10: You know it would be either, some way for them to either have me bypass it.

230
00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:39.260
P10: all right, are we? Oh, we have stopped.

231
00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:40.520
P10: Yeah.

232
00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:46.330
P10: can't move forward on a lie. That's that's that's not. And it's not good for the Va. Either, as far as I'm concerned.

233
00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:48.438
Moderator: Yeah, cause you haven't done the rest.

234
00:19:48.740 --> 00:20:01.559
P10: Right? You know they yeah. Supposedly they have our best interests. Well, if you're taking surveys and asking us questions, then you need to have it so that we can answer honestly.

235
00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:02.960
Moderator: Yes.

236
00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:04.640
P10: And this won't let me do it.

237
00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:14.570
Moderator: Yeah, that's great feedback. Okay. So you said, if you were on this page you couldn't move forward, you would call someone to try and get help.

238
00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:17.419
P10: Work we're done.

239
00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:31.949
Moderator: Yeah. So let's just pretend that. I'm telling you you called me. And I'm saying, Oh, yes, this is a really confusing question. And what you have to do here to keep moving forward is you're gonna have to go back to the previous page.

240
00:20:33.496 --> 00:20:34.590
Moderator: And then.

241
00:20:37.195 --> 00:20:37.910
P10: Okay.

242
00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:40.689
Moderator: Are you able to go back to the previous page.

243
00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:41.350
P10: No,

244
00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:46.699
Moderator: So at the very bottom.

245
00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:51.219
P10: There's a previous button on the bottom left side.

246
00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:52.319
P10: Okay? Got it.

247
00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:58.060
Moderator: Okay? And so this is a confusing question.

248
00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:02.670
P10: Oh, it's strange!

249
00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:06.060
Moderator: I think

250
00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:17.729
Moderator: I think there's supposed to be an other option. Okay, we're just gonna click. No, for now, so that we can get through this question, and I'll report that

251
00:21:18.468 --> 00:21:21.809
Moderator: there should be an other button in that list that you saw.

252
00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:24.199
P10: Kind of learned some stuff here, aren't we?

253
00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:25.380
Moderator: Yeah, okay.

254
00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:27.130
P10: So next button correct.

255
00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:28.689
Moderator: Yes, please. Thank you.

256
00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:29.469
P10: All right.

257
00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:38.520
P10: Let's see here in the past 2 months have you been living in a stable housing that you own rent, or stay in as a whole. Yes.

258
00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:42.650
P10: Okay, so come on.

259
00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:49.100
P10: The screen is blocking the question.

260
00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:50.620
P10: The answer.

261
00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:52.100
Moderator: Oh, what's blocking it?

262
00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:54.880
P10: The the the screen of people are are.

263
00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:58.960
Moderator: With my face. So if you

264
00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:05.139
P10: Right on top of the videos able to take that bar and move it around.

265
00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:07.200
P10: So if you can move it, yes.

266
00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:09.000
Moderator: Top of the screen, or something.

267
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.490
P10: Gotcha that works. Okay. Thank you.

268
00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:13.120
Moderator: Yeah.

269
00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:17.289
P10: I I see I don't touch buttons, because 9 times out of 10 I mess up.

270
00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:19.839
P10: Yeah, just in case just play it safe

271
00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:22.719
P10: alright! So that got that next.

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:32.200

273
00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:40.190
P10: whether the statement has been often true, sometimes true or never true in my household. Okay.

274
00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:43.870

P10: I like that. Okay.

277
00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:59.770
P10: let's see here, within the past 12 months, the food you bought just didn't last. And you didn't have money to get more.

278
00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:01.790
P10: Never true.

279
00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:07.620

P10: There you go!

282
00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:14.429
Moderator: Any feedback about those questions before we keep going.

283
00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:16.419
P10: No, no, I

284
00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:24.939
P10: I like the questions because there's a lot of veterans that need to answer those and answer them honestly. But in my household.

285
00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:28.930
P10: Very fortunately, as a matter of fact.

286
00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:35.519
P10: Okay, do you currently smoke cigarettes? Nope, thank you very much.

287
00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:39.890
P10: I currently use. Nope, I Nope.

288
00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:45.329
P10: let's see in the past. I quit and do not. Okay, cigarettes. Right? Let's see. Yeah.

289
00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:46.170
Moderator: Yes.

290
00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:50.499
P10: So I did. Let's say I declined. Okay, there we go.

291
00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:54.030
P10: Let's see here next.

292
00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:59.840
P10: When did you quit smoking? Rat? Oh, excuse me,

293
00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:01.670
Moderator: No worries.

294
00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:04.810
P10: Let's see, at least 15 years.

295
00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:07.239
P10: Best thing you ever did. Well.

296
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:10.079
P10: stop drinking. That was the best thing I ever did.

297
00:24:10.535 --> 00:24:18.150
Moderator: So before we do this last question, any feedback about those tobacco related questions.

298
00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:19.070
P10: Net.

299
00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:22.539
P10: Okay, I don't have a problem with those at all.

300
00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:23.380
Moderator: Agree.

301
00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:25.909
P10: Okay, let's see here

302
00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:35.389
P10: this question asks about your sexual orientation. All patients are asked about their sexual orientation, so that preventive care.

303
00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:43.159
P10: all right. One more second, do you think you? What do you think of your sexual orientation as

304
00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:48.409
P10: as and I'm gonna be honest with you. To me this is very offensive.

305
00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:50.449
Moderator: Oh, can you tell me?

306
00:24:50.450 --> 00:25:15.840
P10: I don't think it's my age, or whatever I just don't approve of it, I really do not. It doesn't matter whether I'm lesbian. It doesn't matter whether I'm gay. It doesn't matter absolutely anything. I don't walk down the street with a pole in my hand, telling you what sex I am and who I sleep with. It's very, very offensive to me, and has been for quite some time.

307
00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:17.640
P10: So, yeah,

308
00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:21.279
Moderator: Yeah. So you think they shouldn't ask it?

309
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:26.130
P10: Yeah, unless you can tell me the reason why? Absolutely.

310
00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:27.230
Moderator: Hmm.

311
00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:33.670
P10: Unless they have a valid reason for asking me my sexual orientation. It's none of their business.

312
00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:34.790
Moderator: Yeah.

313
00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:39.699
P10: Okay, and it's not my business. What yours is I don't care.

314
00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:40.990
Moderator: Yeah, yeah.

315
00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:47.359
P10: Okay. I don't like the question. It's very to me. It's very, very offensive, and it has been for a very long time.

316
00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:48.920
P10: Hmm! That's good to know.

317
00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:53.270
P10: Okay? Like I said, like, I know, I have found out.

318
00:25:54.550 --> 00:26:11.446
P10: I had talked to somebody about and I'm not even sure which question. But but the why of it? Why do you ask? And then the question is, or the answer was basically because of my

319
00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:25.269
P10: are nationality. Like I'm I'm [redacted PII]. There's Hispanics. There's African Americans. There's this, and there's that.

320
00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:46.359
P10: Why do you want to know? Because that's also offensive to me to ask that question constantly, and not many people know the answer. But I found an answer, because if I'm offended, I want to know why? Why it upsets me. Okay? Because if I'm wrong, then I need to change. But as it turns out, it's because the medications they have

321
00:26:47.330 --> 00:27:01.020
P10: can cause harm to a person depending on their nationality. If they're black or Hispanic, whatever nationality they are, it can cause medical issues.

322
00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:02.490
Moderator: Hmm.

323
00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:21.120
P10: And I didn't know that. And I thought, Well, darn, you know. So I had. I had to step back from that because it's a valid reason for them to know just in case you give me some medication, and I'm allergic to horse meat or something. It can make me very sick.

324
00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:33.700
P10: What the question is for. But I had to. You know I had to ask those. I have to ask the questions. Why do you want to know, I mean, the weight question is another one that just irritates the snot out of me.

325
00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:49.030
P10: Yeah, this is personal and personal, but it's the same concept, because my weight can change the dynamics of medication, and if they don't know my size.

326
00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:51.669
P10: it can cause and do me harm.

327
00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:56.669
P10: So guess what? My pride ain't got nothing over my help.

328
00:27:57.060 --> 00:28:01.120
P10: you know. But had I not asked that question, I would not know.

329
00:28:01.869 --> 00:28:09.770
Moderator: So this question, you say you only think they should ask if they can tell you why it matters for your health.

330
00:28:10.185 --> 00:28:14.120
P10: Yes, yeah. I wanna know why, I surely did.

331
00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:15.740
Moderator: Yes. Yeah.

332
00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:20.635
P10: Alright so. But that is definitely one. That's yeah.

333
00:28:21.970 --> 00:28:29.050
Moderator: That's good feedback. Okay, we can continue on with the rest of the.

334
00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:32.480
P10: Now, would you like me to go ahead and put? Prefer not to answer.

335
00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:35.980
Moderator: If that's what you do, if I aren't here, and you were just filling it out.

336
00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:37.470
P10: Well, if it if it was.

337
00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:41.089
P10: I would just not fill it out. I would just not. I would. I would let it go.

338
00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:42.670
Moderator: Oh, you wouldn't click, submit.

339
00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:46.314
P10: Oh, hell, no! Oh, excuse me, no! -

340
00:28:46.770 --> 00:28:47.270
Moderator: Okay.

341
00:28:47.270 --> 00:28:53.880
P10: Okay, so that's my rebellion. All right. I'm I'm almost 70. So that that's my my rebellious.

342
00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:58.609
Moderator: Fine. So let's say you did that, and then how would you? Finish up.

343
00:28:59.548 --> 00:29:01.140
P10: I I would just well

344
00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:15.330
P10: hand it in. I would turn it in. That was the last question. That would be the last question. So. But I'm I'm I can't really do that with this, because of how it's generated. So I would definitely say, prefer not to answer.

345
00:29:15.670 --> 00:29:18.270
Moderator: Okay, so go ahead and fill that out.

346
00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:23.850
P10: Not not trying to be a pain in anybody's backside. But here I am.

347
00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:26.890
Moderator: This is this is helpful information.

348
00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:31.440
P10: Okay, so what else would you like me to do.

349
00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:54.269
Moderator: Okay, so that is the end of all of the screeners. And right before I have you leave this window, I just want to ask for each set of questions how easy or difficult it was to respond to. And so I'm going to ask on a scale of one to 5. 1 is very easy, and 5 is very difficult.

350
00:29:54.830 --> 00:30:01.870
Moderator: So for the 1st one toxic exposures, how easy or difficult was it to answer that set of questions.

351
00:30:02.419 --> 00:30:04.069
P10: Oh, answering it.

352
00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:08.580
P10: I'm going to tell you it was about a 4

353
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:14.779
P10: because I need to know more information myself on what I got myself into when I was in the military.

354
00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:18.959
P10: and they and the Va. Is not forthcoming.

355
00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:20.520
Moderator: No, because you.

356
00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:21.420
P10: They need.

357
00:30:21.890 --> 00:30:24.670
Moderator: You don't actually know what exactly.

358
00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:25.140
P10: Correct.

359
00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:25.720
Moderator: Bye.

360
00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:26.380
P10: Correct.

361
00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:29.000
P10: Yeah, okay.

362
00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:34.900
Moderator: That's good to know and then for the homelessness and food, insecurity, reminder.

363
00:30:35.690 --> 00:30:45.579
P10: That. I guess it's a 5 MI think it's a great question, an awesome question, actually, because there's a lot of men and women that are homeless, and they need the help.

364
00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:50.940
Moderator: Hmm, oh, so 5 means very difficult, and one is very easy.

365
00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:56.380
P10: Okay. So so one is number 2,

366
00:30:57.180 --> 00:31:06.439
P10: right? Okay? And then the difficult one is is number one. So that would have been what? Probably a 3 or 4. Let's see here.

367
00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:09.929
Moderator: Okay. So you're saying, toxic toxic exposure was difficult.

368
00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:10.930
P10: Yes.

369
00:31:11.424 --> 00:31:16.940
Moderator: You can also just tell me. Difficult, very difficult, easy, or very easy.

370
00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:19.629
Moderator: Okay for me. It it was difficult.

371
00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:23.120
P10: It was definitely difficult. Okay.

372
00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:29.439
Moderator: Yeah. So toxic exposure, difficult homelessness and food insecurity very easy.

373
00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:30.720
Moderator: And then.

374
00:31:30.890 --> 00:31:34.320
P10: Easy. That's, you know. That's just

375
00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:41.959
P10: maybe it's because I smoked for so long and quit. But it but it is. It's a good question to keep asking people.

376
00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:42.920
Moderator: Hmm.

377
00:31:43.535 --> 00:31:52.224
P10: It's a hard one, because people don't wanna own it, and they get irritated. And it's like you're getting into my business, and it's not yours. Da da da, it's like, wait a second.

378
00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:58.930
Moderator: Yeah, but but it's it's but to for me to answering it. Yeah, it was easy, very easy.

379
00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:02.250
Moderator: And then for that last one sexual orientation.

380
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.020
P10: Oh, it was hard! It was hard.

381
00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:08.860
Moderator: Yeah, so difficult.

382
00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:11.790
P10: Yes, difficult, very difficult, I think, for me.

383
00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:12.480
Moderator: Difficult.

384
00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:13.620
Moderator: Yeah.

385
00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:27.609
Moderator: okay, that's all. For this actual screen. So you can like X out of it. And we can go just back to the normal videos. So I think there should be a stop share button at the top

386
00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:29.470
Moderator: black bar. You see.

387
00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:31.350
P10: Yeah, that red.

388
00:32:32.594 --> 00:32:33.359
P10: Yeah.

389
00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:35.020
P10: I love my printers.

390
00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:36.790
P10: Let's see close.

391
00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:39.910
P10: Ask before closing multiple tabs. Cancel.

392
00:32:41.235 --> 00:32:47.620
Moderator: Yeah. You also don't have to close it out. I just wanna have you stop sharing screen.

393
00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:51.710
P10: Okay. So where am I going to do that? Let's see. Here.

394
00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:56.570
Moderator: So if you see that black row where originally you looked up the chat.

395
00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:57.170
P10: Okay.

396
00:32:57.170 --> 00:32:57.940
Moderator: Be a stop.

397
00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:00.450
P10: Oh, okay, stop! Share. Okay, there we go.

398
00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:09.380
P10: There we go. Thank you. This is everything. All up in that little bitty bar. All everything is up on that little bitty bar.

399
00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:13.119
Moderator: Yeah, yeah. Do you have like a very big monitor?

400
00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:17.647
P10: I do on this one? That's why I was trying to use my my ipad.

401
00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:20.700
Moderator: Yeah, yeah. So everything's quite small for you. Like the 10.

402
00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:21.320
P10: Yeah.

403
00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:22.210
Moderator: Yeah.

404
00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:24.849
P10: I need them a little bit bigger, so.

405
00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:32.471
Moderator: Yeah, that's also good to know. So I think we just have like, 2 more minutes with you.

406
00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:38.650
Moderator: and and we got through everything which is great. I just want to ask before we wrap up

407
00:33:40.810 --> 00:33:50.990
Moderator: If you had to interact with this prototype to answer questions about your healthcare on a regular basis. How satisfied or dissatisfied would you be.

408
00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:55.880
P10: I'd be dissatisfied. I like talking to people.

409
00:33:57.460 --> 00:33:57.989
P10: i'm, really.

410
00:33:57.990 --> 00:33:58.830
Moderator: Do it in person.

411
00:33:58.830 --> 00:34:04.359
P10: Yeah, yeah, we're losing. We're losing our contact with each other.

412
00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:09.420
P10: It's causing a a distance problem with each other.

413
00:34:09.639 --> 00:34:13.669
P10: We do not know a lot about how to communicate with each other.

414
00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:14.670
Moderator: Hmm.

415
00:34:14.670 --> 00:34:18.890
P10: No, I'll take people any day of the week.

416
00:34:19.558 --> 00:34:30.789
Moderator: Yeah, let's say, if you did have to complete this online, would you feel like safe and secure putting your personal health information

417
00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:31.699
Moderator: online.

418
00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:34.806
P10: Oh, yes, yeah, that's not a problem.

419
00:34:35.230 --> 00:34:40.289
P10: So it's it's not about the safety and security. It's a preference. You'd rather talk to people. Yeah.

420
00:34:40.290 --> 00:34:44.899
P10: I like people. I think we're important. And we're losing. That is what I think.

421
00:34:45.329 --> 00:34:51.629
Moderator: Yeah, yeah, that's great. And then, do you have any questions for me?

422
00:34:52.199 --> 00:34:53.779
P10: No, ma'am, I sure don't.

423
00:34:54.380 --> 00:35:00.773
Moderator: Got it, and then I'll also let our observers, if. Do you have any questions to ask? [Observer].

And lastly, Chantelle's going to send you a thank you. Note with a little blurb, that you can pass along to other veterans, you might know, so that they can also participate in research studies like this.

431
00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:56.780
P10: Awesome. I hope they do. It's well, well, well worth it.

432
00:35:57.020 --> 00:36:00.769
Moderator: Awesome. Thank you so much, and hope you have a really nice day.

433
00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:03.259
P10: Thank you, I will. Y'all take good care of yourselves.

434
00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:04.920
