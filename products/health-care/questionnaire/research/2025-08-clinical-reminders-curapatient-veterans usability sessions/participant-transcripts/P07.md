8
00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:48.740

9
00:00:51.150 --> 00:01:01.359
Moderator: No, okay, all right. So- so right now, we're gonna pretend that you're at your doc. You have a doctor's appointment in 2 days

10
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:20.129
Moderator: and your doctor emailed you some health questionnaires for you to complete before your upcoming appointment. Now, these actual questions may or may not be directly related to your upcoming appointment. They're just general questions about your overall health history

11
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:41.788
Moderator: and current situation. So some of these questions will be familiar to you. While others may not be. So. What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna send you a prototype link in the chat and I'm gonna ask you to read out loud the questions, and before you move

12
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.632
Moderator: through the prototype. I'm gonna ask you some questions about the the prototype

13
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.700
Moderator: And so what do like you said you're on your laptop right now

14
00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.019
Moderator: correct. You see your your chat function at the bottom.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.210
P7: Yeah, I just clicked on it. There it is.

16
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.379
Moderator: Okay. So I'm gonna paste that link in the chat and send it to you right now.

17
00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.360
Moderator: do you see it?

18
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:22.860
Moderator: Okay? So before you do anything with the link? I'm gonna ask you to share your screen.

19
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.469
Moderator: Do you see the share button on the bottom.

20
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.219
P7: Oh, yes, yeah, it is. Okay.

21
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.940
Moderator: So if you could, please click on that.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.850
Moderator: and it will prompt you to share.

23
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:58.650
Moderator: Okay, let's see if you can go back to the zoom icon on the bottom.

24
00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:06.540
Moderator: or do you still see the the chat function at all on your right hand side?

25
00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:15.169
P7: Now one way, and it's a zoom page, and then our pictures.

26
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:27.760
Moderator: Okay, I'm really having time hearing you and it- it. And your volume is breaking up.

27
00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:36.730
Moderator: And it may be that it's it's just too far. I'm not sure apologies for that.

28
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.929
P7: Can you hear me any better?

29
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:52.349
Moderator: Yes, I can. So so do you see your chat function at all where the link.

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:56.840
P7: Okay.

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.610
Moderator: And now I'm going to ask you to share your screen again.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.860
P7: And it is.

36
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:13.360
Moderator: Okay.

37
00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.960
P7: Now I'm getting this the same wide screen with the layouts and everything on it.

38
00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:29.749
Moderator: Okay. So do you see a toolbar across? That it could be floating in the middle of your screen at all.

39
00:04:32.527 --> 00:04:34.829
P7: Check this link.

40
00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:46.500

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:57.729
P7: oh, this sounds like you're doing different. Okay, there we go.

43
00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:59.930
P7: It worked this time.

Moderator: Now I see it. Okay. Thank you.

Moderator: Yes, thank you very much. So before you do anything, I'm just gonna ask you to allow to hit. Yes, allow this.

48
00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.150
Moderator: Yeah, perfect.

49
00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:35.059
Moderator: So before you do anything here, I'd like you to just read out loud what you see and don't read everything out just

50
00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:43.349
Moderator: the larger fun. And just tell me your overall expression of what you think of of the screen.

51
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:58.900
P7: Okay, I see a Hello patient portal, toxic exposures, screening, clinical reminder, homework.

P7: food, insecurity, clinical reminder, tobacco, critical reminder, and sexual orientation, clinical reminder.

53
00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:15.400
Moderator: So what's your IM-impression of this

54
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:26.860
Moderator: of the screen? Do you have any? Is everything clear to you? Do you have any?

55
00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:29.790
Moderator: No.

56
00:06:30.555 --> 00:06:34.900
P7: Understand everything that's I don't know.

57
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:43.669
Moderator: So I'm gonna ask you to proceed with this questionnaire as if I wasn't here

58
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:46.640
Moderator: like, what would you do if I wasn't here?

59
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:55.269
Moderator: But again, just a reminder before you click on anything. I'm just gonna ask you a few questions on each screen.

60
00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:58.050
Moderator: so go ahead and proceed.

61
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:05.070
P7: I guess, after looking at this, I would.

62
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:08.220
P7: We're going to have in.

63
00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:17.339
Moderator: Okay, go ahead and and- and- and continue.

P7: Okay.

65
00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:30.809
Moderator: And again, just gonna remind you to have the laptop as close to you as possible, because I'm not sure if it's the connection. But it's it's really hard to hear you.

66
00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:32.790
P7: Can you? Can you hear me now?

67
00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:46.280
P7: Oh, okay.

68
00:07:54.910 --> 00:08:02.170
P7: reminder. Do you think you were exposed to any toxins, other or other hazards by serving in the armed forces.

69
00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:12.770
Moderator: Okay. Now, before you answer this, what's your overall impression about this screen?

70
00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:23.784
P7: It's simple to read. It's laid out. It's clear I can see the prompt

71
00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:31.099
P7: and right below it. It even talks about examples of toxic exposures go back.

72
00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:33.610
P7: didn't have any questions. I would.

73
00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:36.255
Moderator: Okay.

74
00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.730
Moderator: What would you do next.

75
00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:51.290
P7: I would scroll to the bottom and answer yes or no.

76
00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:56.000
Moderator: Okay, I'm gonna ask you to move forward. Please.

77
00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.040
P7: Okay.

78
00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:07.620
Moderator: Okay.

79
00:09:08.696 --> 00:09:17.220
Moderator: again, I'm gonna ask you to read this screen and let me know if there's anything unexpected about this page.

80
00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:25.230
P7: Okay, this is the homeless and food insecurity clinic reminder.

81
00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:34.109
P7: In the last 2 months have you been living in stable housing that you own rent, or stay in as part of a household.

82
00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:38.930
P7: and

83
00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:46.300
P7: to that, and.

84
00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:47.250
Moderator: Okay, go ahead.

85
00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:48.060
P7: Sort of there.

86
00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:50.750
Moderator: Okay, go ahead.

87
00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:55.199
Moderator: So is this what you expected to happen.

88
00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:57.750
P7: Yes.

89
00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:04.989
P7: it's not doing anything past this, though.

90
00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:12.679
Moderator: Okay, how does that make you feel like, what would you do next?

91
00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:17.790
P7: With it, not moving forward.

92
00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:20.870
Moderator: How would you do that.

93
00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:28.270
P7: Well, I hit the submit button, and it didn't move me forward. So

94
00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.539
P7: oh, okay, it did.

95
00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.520
Moderator: What would you do next? [redacted PII]?

96
00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:42.390
P7: This and

97
00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:52.270
P7: scroll down and read the next questions. I didn't really need to scroll down and see them. Okay, within the past 12 months

98
00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:57.359
P7: you worried whether your food would run out before you got money to buy more.

99
00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:09.609
P7: Okay? And they do ask me these questions every time I go there, but they ask them to me verbally. By the way.

100
00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:12.530
Moderator: Okay. So you remember, top.

101
00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:20.419
P7: No, I think just with them, verbally doing it. Didn't think it was my mind as a questionnaire.

102
00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:25.730
P7: I was thinking about somebody handing me a paper, and me doing it in writing. When you said that.

103
00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:36.509
Moderator: Okay, so let's see. So it's still loading here. And and let's pretend that I am not here.

104
00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:40.693
Moderator: What would you do next if you encountered this.

105
00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:50.289
Moderator: Go ahead and do what you would do. Normally.

106
00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:53.890
P7: Go on through like I am. Yes.

107
00:11:54.810 --> 00:12:00.890
Moderator: Okay, so was there anything unexpected?

108
00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:02.990
P7: No.

109
00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:03.755
Moderator: Okay.

110
00:12:05.511 --> 00:12:09.300
P7: To scroll down, to finish reading everything.

111
00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:10.194
Moderator: Okay.

112
00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:12.830
P7: It's the only thing, really, you know, that.

113
00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.160
P7: Yes, I didn't know it first.st

114
00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.730
Moderator: Okay, I'm gonna ask you to read.

115
00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:34.249
P7: Okay of the document regarding cigarettes only

116
00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:37.440
P7: other forms of tobacco, or is e-cigarettes.

117
00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.150
P7: I currently use cigarettes.

118
00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:43.120
Moderator: Again, [redacted PII], if you could speak louder, please.

119
00:12:43.743 --> 00:12:49.339
P7: I use cigarettes in the past, but quit and do not currently use them.

120
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:54.499
P7: and that's when that would apply to me. I declined to.

121
00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:58.970
P7: I'm not able to give the complete smoking history.

122
00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:03.950
P7: so I would click it for the one that pertain to me and matched.

123
00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:05.320
Moderator: Okay.

124
00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:15.030
Moderator: Alright. So now I'm gonna pretend that you received a phone call from your friend.

125
00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:20.710
Moderator: And you're right. Now, you're experiencing all these issues like the loading issue.

126
00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:25.999
Moderator: And let's say you want to come back to the screen

127
00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:31.529
Moderator: at a later time. Can you show me what you would do.

128
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:46.919
P7: Well, I would if I could go ahead and exit out and go to home.

129
00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:50.039
Moderator: Okay. Now, why would you want to go to home?

130
00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:58.949
P7: Cause we think I need to back out and want to say what I've done.

131
00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:04.022
Moderator: Okay. So I'm gonna ask you to go ahead and proceed with what you'd like to do.

132
00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:11.910
P7: Back at the beginning where I started.

133
00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:25.339
Moderator: Okay. So I'm gonna ask you to to tell me what's going on right now. And

134
00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:28.430
Moderator: and is this expected or unexpected.

135
00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:36.820
P7: Where it brought me back to the home page with the 4

136
00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:40.700
P7: political reminders that we started off with.

137
00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:45.270
P7: And that's exactly what I thought I'd be doing when I clicked on buttons.

138
00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:47.100
Moderator: Okay.

139
00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:52.359
Moderator: So so let's see.

140
00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:05.629
Moderator: So now I'm gonna ask you to X out of it on the tab.

141
00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:11.839
Moderator: And what I'm gonna do is, once you X out of it, I'm gonna ask you

142
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.339
Moderator: to re-enter with the same link.

143
00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:20.620
Moderator: So how would you get? How would you exit

144
00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:23.309
Moderator: this questionnaire? What would you do.

145
00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:28.860
P7: From the home page where I'm at.

146
00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:34.759
Moderator: That's the only way we exit this questionnaire.

147
00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:37.000
P7: Yes.

148
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:38.880
Moderator: Okay.

149
00:15:39.414 --> 00:15:49.789
Moderator: so right now, what I'm gonna ask you to do is, do you see where it says, cura vet up on the upper left side there's a tab with an X.

150
00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:55.530
Moderator: So if you can go up to your upper left all the way up.

151
00:15:57.690 --> 00:16:01.429
P7: Yes, right there and then there's an X right there to the right.

152
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:01.930
P7: Good.

153
00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:04.079
Moderator: Click on that for me.

154
00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:06.149
P7: On that one.

155
00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:07.040
Moderator: Yeah.

156
00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:10.390
P7: Okay? And we're back where you and I work. Okay.

157
00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:17.930
Moderator: So now, I'm gonna ask you to re enter the experience. So what you're gonna do is you're gonna click on the link again.

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:44.660
Moderator: Okay. What would you do next.

161
00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:51.050
P7: I would go back to start the clinical reminders again.

162
00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:54.680
Moderator: Okay. Show me how you would do that.

P7: Okay.

168
00:17:25.729 --> 00:17:33.369
Moderator: And again, is this all what you expected? If you could read out loud the questions, and just tell me your overall opinion.

169
00:17:33.779 --> 00:17:40.330
P7: When did you quit smoking and quit smoking greater than or equal to 15 years ago?

170
00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:42.120
Moderator: Check that one.

171
00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:46.109
Moderator: Okay, if that's what you would do. Yes.

172
00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:52.790
P7: And it's the sexual orientation. This question. Ask you about your sexual orientation.

173
00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:56.900
P7: Our patients ask about their sexual orientation to the

174
00:17:58.030 --> 00:18:03.070
P7: prevention, care to meet your health. Codes can be recommended. You may

175
00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:13.099
P7: indicate more than one sexual orientation, or choose not to answer, so scroll down to it.

176
00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:13.940
P7: Cheers.

177
00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:17.979
Moderator: Is there anything unclear or unexpected about this page?

178
00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:20.120
P7: No.

179
00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:23.830
Moderator: Okay, you can go. Please proceed.

180
00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:29.820
P7: Okay, do you think that'd be a sexual orientation as

181
00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:33.469
P7: straighter, heterosexual? That's what I put.

182
00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:35.489
P7: And now let's submit that.

183
00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:45.050
P7: And it brought me back to the front page.

184
00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:51.890
Moderator: Okay, so what's what do you think happened right now?

185
00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:57.300
P7: I would think that I completed the 4 reminders.

186
00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:58.770
Moderator: Okay,

187
00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:09.259
Moderator: Did you expect anything else after you've did you expect to see anything else after you completed the last question.

188
00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:19.919
P7: It would have been nicer if it gave me a screen, saying, I've completed it.

189
00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:21.330
Moderator: Okay.

190
00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:22.649
P7: Figure that out.

191
00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:32.470
P7: So you wanted you would like to see a screen that showed you that you've completed the questionnaire. And

192
00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:35.170
P7: yeah, at the very end that when I

193
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:40.929
P7: just click that last time, instead of this screen coming up when saying I've completed it.

194
00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:42.260
Moderator: Okay.

195
00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:43.590
P7: Because when

196
00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:49.279
P7: back to the homepage I didn't know if I messed up, and it brought me back to the home page, or

197
00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:51.599
P7: you know what I mean.

198
00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:59.424
Moderator: Yeah. And again, if you can get a little closer to the mic. So all these questions,

199
00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:03.177
Moderator: all 4 questions that you've answered

200
00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:22.850
Moderator: Based on the layout and the look of the questions, and how easy or difficult was it to read the questions on a scale of one to 5 with one being very easy and 5 being very difficult. How easy or difficult

201
00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:25.919
Moderator: was it to answer these questions.

202
00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:31.190

Moderator: One very easy. Okay.

204
00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:45.610
Moderator: can you tell me we're done with the questionnaire? But I'm just gonna ask you a few questions. What's your overall impression of this prototype right now.

205
00:20:50.990 --> 00:21:00.060
P7: I think it was nice. It was simple, and I could easily get walk myself through. Yes.

206
00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:08.969
Moderator: Okay, we're parts of the questionnaire worked. Did it work as you expected?

207
00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:10.280
P7: Yes.

208
00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:17.190
Moderator: Okay. Was there anything that stood out to you that you weren't sure about.

209
00:21:22.043 --> 00:21:24.869
P7: But the only thing would have been.

210
00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:29.009
P7: But I did answer all the questions at the very end.

211
00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:31.279
Moderator: I'm sorry I can't hear your last sentence.

212
00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:34.949
P7: That that I did answer all the questions at the end.

P7: but it did do it completely. Yeah.

217
00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:46.129
Moderator: Yeah, so what what would you have liked to see instead.

218
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.790

Moderator: Okay?

223
00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:17.680
Moderator: And finally.

224
00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:35.990
Moderator: if you, if the Va. Sent out questionnaires on a regular cadence with you to you, let's say every 3 months or so, and they use this prototype to send the questionnaires to you. How would you feel about interacting with this tool

225
00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:38.709
Moderator: on a long term basis?

226
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.210

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:51.849
Moderator: Okay. Can you explain? Why could you tell me a little bit more about why you would be happy to interact with this tool? What is it that you liked about it?
