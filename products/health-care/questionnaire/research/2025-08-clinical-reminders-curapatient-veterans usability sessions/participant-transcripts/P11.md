6
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.410
Moderator: by your physician via email or text.

7
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:38.479
P11: Not that I know of. I think the only surveys I receive is from the scheduling department.

8
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.689
Moderator: Just want to know how how the scheduling went, you know.

9
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.220

11
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.099
Moderator: Oh, okay.

12
00:00:52.100 --> 00:01:04.029
P11: Yeah, I don't think, I responded. I I thought, you know, if if I have a problem or question, it's not with the bill or with the scheduling department. Usually it's it's with somebody else, you know, and

13
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.860
P11: I don't even know how to, you know.

14
00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.270

18
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:40.480
Moderator: So

19
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:53.350
Moderator: what we're gonna do is we're gonna pretend that you have a doctor's appointment in 2 days, and your doctor emailed you a a batch of health questionnaires for you to answer

20
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.639
Moderator: before your upcoming appointment. And

21
00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:09.579
Moderator: these questions may or may not have anything to do with your appointment. Okay, so though they will be health questionnaires just to get your overall general health.

22
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.069
Moderator: or it. It could be, you know, specific to you.

23
00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.359
Moderator: okay. So we're gonna pretend that your doctor sent you a link that's specific to you.

24
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:30.669
Moderator: But your name won't be on this link. Obviously. So what browser are you using today? [redacted PII] ?

25
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.450

Moderator: Okay. So Google Chrome, okay, excellent. So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna I'm gonna ask you to share your screen.

27
00:02:46.480 --> 00:03:03.159
Moderator: But first, st what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna send you the link that you will use to click on the prototype to enter the prototype. So I'm gonna send it in the chat now, but don't click on it. Just let me know whether you received it or not.

28
00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.220
P11: Alright!

29
00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:06.360

34
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.940
Moderator: Yes, excellent! If you could press that, please.

35
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.530
P11: I guess I have a lot of different options. You you just need one desktop right.

36
00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:31.560
Moderator: Yes.

37
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.189

40
00:03:48.010 --> 00:04:06.560
Moderator: Okay, so go ahead and click on the link that I sent you. And once you get into the experience, I'm just gonna ask you a few questions on it before you move forward or before you click on anything, so go ahead and click on the link. Now, please.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.130
Moderator: if that's possible.

46
00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.090

Moderator: anything that is unexpected.

53
00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.749

Moderator: Is- is this page unexpected?

60
00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:46.790
Moderator: For what? In in terms of what you imagined to see? Once you clicked on the link.

61
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:52.639
P11: Well, if if it was sent in the form of a questionnaire, I don't really see any questions on it.

62
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:54.100

63
00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:00.075

Moderator: What would you do to to find the questions?

67
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.970
Moderator: Let's pretend I wasn't here.

68
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.295
P11: Maybe click on something.

69
00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.990
Moderator: Okay, so you would click on that.

70
00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:22.059
Moderator: And what would you do next?

71
00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.100
P11: It doesn't appear that anything happened when I clicked on it.

72
00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:36.780
Moderator: So do you see anything else on the page that could help you start the experience.

73
00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:49.040
P11: home. I don't know.

74
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:53.029
Moderator: Are there any terms on here that are confusing for you.

75
00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.999
P11: Well, a clinical reminder. I don't really know what a clinical reminder is.

Moderator: Okay.

77
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:04.499
P11: And the recommended education.

78
00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:11.410
P11: I don't know what that is. I I guess it's like some kind of training I can take or.

79
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.000
Moderator: Okay.

80
00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:20.270
Moderator: So, knowing that your doctor asked you to take health questionnaires, what would you do next?

81
00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:26.089
P11: Can I hit the home button.

82
00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:27.260
Moderator: Heck! Yes.

83
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.100
P11: Doesn't look like anything's happening there.

84
00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.070
Moderator: What did you expect to happen there.

85
00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:42.270
P11: Well, I don't know. Maybe go back to like a dashboard or.

86
00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:43.210
Moderator: Okay.

87
00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:50.099
P11: See. Hello! Hello! Inpatient! You know I mean, normally I would be an outpatient.

88
00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:51.770
Moderator: Okay.

89
00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:01.280
P11: Yeah, I'm just. I mean, when I click on these is something supposed to happen.

90
00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:18.710
Moderator: yeah. So this is just essentially a list of your questionnaires. And in order for you to start the questionnaires, you'd have to press on start clinical reminders. So that was tricky. And I'm glad that we got that feedback.

91
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:21.549
P11: Oh, okay, I see. Yeah.

92
00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:22.590
Moderator: Yeah, so go ahead.

93
00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:25.439

Moderator: Yeah, you know, they.

95
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:32.960
P11: Yeah, so, okay.

96
00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:43.309
Moderator: That was an important observation. What can we go back to the next page? How would you go back to the next page if you wanted to go back to the previous page.

97
00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:55.809
P11: I don't know. Hit the back button, I guess.

98
00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:56.940
Moderator: Okay.

99
00:08:59.052 --> 00:09:05.570

100
00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:08.352
P11: You know what I have all day. So

101
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:12.720
P11: okay, what made you think that these were links, [redacted PII]?

102
00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:18.959
P11: Well, when I when I hover the mouse over him. It turns into a clickable hand, you know.

103
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:19.930
Moderator: Okay.

104
00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:21.530
Moderator: Alright.

105
00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:28.039
Moderator: Is there anything else that made you think that they're links.

106
00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:40.269
P11: Well, when I click on it, I do get a little bar over here that looks like it did react in some way, but it didn't open a it didn't open a link.

107
00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:41.370
Moderator: Okay.

108
00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:41.770
P11: So.

109
00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:46.800
Moderator: So what would you expect to happen? You click on it. And what did you expect to see.

110
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:53.050
P11: I thought it would go to toxic exposure, screener, clinical reminder.

111
00:09:53.990 --> 00:10:03.100
Moderator: Great. Thank you for that. That's very valuable feedback, [redacted PII]. So I'm gonna ask you to go to the page that you were just on.

112
00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:04.770
Moderator: how would you do that?

113
00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:07.270
Moderator: Okay, okay.

114
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:16.530
Moderator: so what I'm gonna do, [redacted PII], now is, I'm going to ask you to read the question out loud, including the options.

115
00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:23.070
Moderator: And before you answer anything, I'm just gonna ask you a few questions about each page.

116
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:24.110
P11: Okay.

117
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:25.389
Moderator: Go ahead, please.

118
00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:32.189
P11: Do you think you were exposed to any toxins or other hazards while serving in the armed forces?

119
00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:42.009
P11: Here are some examples of toxic Toxic Exposures Aiden orange, Airborne Hazards and Open Burn Pit. Contaminated Water Camp Lejeune

120
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:47.139
P11: Gulf. War Related exposures Radiation, other exposures.

121
00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:57.119
Moderator: So I just want to emphasize. Although we are asking you questions about these actual questions. The main.

122
00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:03.495
Moderator: the main goal of this research is for us to

123
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:13.580
Moderator: get your feedback on navigating through the prototype on how the Pro. How the content is laid out on the prototype.

124
00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:19.679
Moderator: You know, if you have something that really stands out in terms of the questions, please let us know. But

125
00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:26.220
Moderator: we're not really concerned with minor details of the actual questions, for example, like spelling or things.

126
00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:26.990
P11: Yeah.

127
00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:34.040
Moderator: So go ahead. Is there anything unexpected here that that you see.

128
00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:45.599
P11: Well, when they say other exposures, I assume that when if you click on yes, it'll open a

129
00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:50.429
P11: dialog box or something that you can describe the other exposures.

130
00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:56.969
Moderator: So what would you just pretend that I'm not here? So I'm gonna ask you to move.

131
00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:58.190
Moderator: Okay?

132
00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:08.429
Moderator: And so is this screen what you expected to see.

133
00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:15.009
P11: Well, pretty much, except there's there's no provision for other exposures.

134
00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:19.270
Moderator: Okay. What would you have liked to see on this page?

135
00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:25.738
P11: I I guess, a dialog box that you could type in. Like I I was a

136
00:12:26.821 --> 00:12:30.679
P11: sterile products technician, you know, pharmacy technician

137
00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:40.940
P11: and I. My job was mixing hyperallementations and chemos for injection and stuff like that, and those were all considered

138
00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:43.530
P11: hazardous substances.

139
00:12:44.359 --> 00:12:52.529
P11: But back then they didn't take any precaution, you know, like they do now. So but that's yeah.

140
00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:59.749
P11: If if I if I was going to check you know, do that, I I would want to be able to put in there somewhere what

141
00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:02.360
P11: my other exposure was.

142
00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:09.470
Moderator: Okay. So let's pretend I'm not here and go ahead and do what you would have done if I wasn't here.

143
00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:10.670
P11: Okay.

144
00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:19.526
Moderator: Okay. Can I ask you why you clicked on Agent Orange?

145
00:13:20.775 --> 00:13:22.849
P11: That's what I was exposed to.

146
00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:26.039
Moderator: Okay. So you were exposed to Agent Orange

147
00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:34.539
Moderator: to the other ones. Okay, what would have happened if you weren't exposed to a agent? Orange. What would you have done on that page.

148
00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:36.360
P11: OP.

149
00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:38.259
P11: Oh, so okay. So you pushed back.

150
00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:45.090
Moderator: Was, what did you think of that? By clicking the black back button brought you back to the home.

151
00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:49.600
P11: Yeah. I didn't expect it to go back that far. I thought it was just gonna go one

152
00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:51.919
P11: one step back, you know.

153
00:13:54.150 --> 00:14:02.309
Moderator: And so now, what do you notice going through it now, after clicking back on the homepage and going through it again? What do you notice here.

154
00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:11.310
P11: Looks the same to me.

155
00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:15.709
P11: Is there something? Did something change or.

156
00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:16.640
Moderator: You had.

157
00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:17.360
P11: I mean I would.

158
00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:20.099
Moderator: Originally hit agent, Orange.

159
00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:21.000
P11: Yeah.

Moderator: So. Did you expect to get a a.

161
00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:29.430
P11: All the it would remain checked.

162
00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:32.219
Moderator: Yeah. Did you expect that or no? Or did you expect it?

163
00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:36.850
Moderator: And not, and not save any of your previous answers.

164
00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:39.420
P11: Yeah, I I kind of thought it would. But

165
00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:43.700
P11: you know it's pretty evident whether or not it's checked. So.

166
00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:44.790
Moderator: Okay.

167
00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:49.159
Moderator: So so let's say, we're, you know you weren't

168
00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:58.350
Moderator: exposed to Agent Orange, in fact, that you were weren't exposed to any of these? What would you have done at this point.

169
00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:03.629
P11: Well, I see now there's a previous button. I don't know if that was there before.

170
00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:04.460
Moderator: So.

171
00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:05.679
P11: It wasn't on the

172
00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:11.179
P11: yeah, it wasn't. It's not on the other pages, but so I would click no right.

173
00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:17.010
Moderator: Okay, so you would click. No, even though you were exposed. So.

174
00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:19.520
P11: Oh, I thought you said if I wasn't exposed.

175
00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:23.650
Moderator: So if you were exposed to the

176
00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:31.790
Moderator: you mentioned that you were, you had occupational ex hazard exposure due to your right.

177
00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:32.330
P11: Right.

178
00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:40.119
Moderator: So, but none of those hazards were listed on the the actual page.

179
00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:41.140
P11: Right.

180
00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:41.900
Moderator: So

181
00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:54.399
Moderator: what would you have done at that point? Let's say you were exposed to the occupational hazards that you mentioned. But you weren't exposed to any of them on the list. Would you have done anything different.

182
00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:03.089
P11: I I don't see anything different I could have done, but.

183
00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:09.689
Moderator: Okay, so you would have. You would have hit Agent Orange, regardless whether you were exposed or not.

184
00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:18.750
P11: Well, no, but I mean when I, when I do go to this page and my option to enter.

185
00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:21.929
P11: you know other exposures is not here.

186
00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:22.510
Moderator: Yeah.

187
00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:26.507
P11: I probably just I don't know.

188
00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:29.550
P11: I don't know what I would do really.

189
00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:36.049
Moderator: Okay. So I'm gonna ask you to move on. Thank you for that feedback. That's very valuable.

190
00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:36.880

Moderator: Oh, okay.

P11: if what

200
00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:46.290
Moderator: Okay? So some. So that's unclear to you.

201
00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:47.690
P11: Yeah.

Moderator: What would you have liked to see here.

203
00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:53.000
P11: Hey?

204
00:17:53.690 --> 00:18:01.560
P11: I I thought it might say printed information was offered and provided, if needed, or if requested, or.

205
00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:01.889
Moderator: Thanks.

206

Moderator: If you can read this out loud to me, please.

210
00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:39.710
P11: Okay, thank you for completing this screener.

P11: We'll send you a text or email with information and resources about toxic exposures.

212
00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:50.179
P11: You can ask your provider for printed copies of these resources.

213
00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:58.810
P11: At your next appointment your provider will talk to you about your toxic exposures. If you have questions. Now, contact your provider.

214
00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:01.150
P11: Okay.

215
00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:04.420
Moderator: This page expected or unexpected.

216
00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:13.979
P11: I don't know. It's just kind of weird.

217
00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:17.210
Moderator: Could you elaborate on that? Please.

218
00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:17.930
P11: So.

219
00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:25.739
P11: No, I I guess it's all right. You're basically just saying that

220
00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:39.179
P11: don't have any questions. So I assume if I would have checked one of these other ones it would have sent me, or would have offered me some type of

221
00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:47.050
P11: Oh, course, to to get that information.

222
00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:49.740
Moderator: Why don't you click one of them? So we

223
00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:55.119
Moderator: was that expected or unexpected.

224
00:19:56.850 --> 00:19:58.900
P11: Well, it's the same thing.

225
00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:11.309
P11: We'll connect you with someone who will help answer your questions. We'll also send you a text.

226
00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:17.299
P11: We'll connect you with someone.

227
00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:26.039
P11: Does that mean connect by message? Or they're gonna call me, or.

228
00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:33.869
Moderator: Okay, so that's confusing. So you'd like you'd like more information like, you'd like it. More explicit. What connect means.

229
00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:35.170
P11: Yeah, yeah.

230
00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:36.090
Moderator: Okay.

231
00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:40.990
P11: And that's because it says we'll also send you a text or email.

232
00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:44.100
P11: So I'm I'm assuming connect means.

233
00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:47.192
P11: I don't know what it means.

234
00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:48.330
Moderator: Okay.

235
00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:48.840
P11: Of.

236
00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:54.279
Moderator: Okay, that's great feedback. Thank you. You can move on if you'd like.

237
00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:07.269
P11: Well, when I when I clicked this.

238
00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:13.899
P11: this this was clicked before, but it wouldn't let me move on. I had to click another one

239
00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:16.349
P11: before it would let me move on.

240
00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:18.050
Moderator: Okay.

241
00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:19.949
P11: Now, now it's not doing that, but it.

242
00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:20.540
Moderator: And.

243
00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:22.330
P11: Yeah. Before it did.

244
00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:25.310
Moderator: So there is a little bug there.

245
00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:28.830
P11: Hmm, okay.

246
00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:31.090
Moderator: Go ahead and find.

247
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:45.170
P11: In the past 2 months have you been living in a stable housing that you own rent, or stay in as part of a household?

248
00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:46.330
P11: Yes.

249
00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:49.849
Moderator: Can you move on? Please.

250
00:21:51.850 --> 00:22:01.640
P11: The following 2 statements that people may make about their food situation. The following are 2 statements for each statement. Please indicate whether the statement has

251
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:06.809
P11: been often true, sometimes true, never true. In the last 12 months.

252
00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:13.240
P11: See? Past 12 months. You were worry about your food.

253
00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:14.780
P11: Yeah.

254
00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:24.530
P11: Last 12 months. The food you bought just didn't last until okay.

255
00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:37.000
Moderator: So those last questions, what did you think of them? Was there anything unclear or unexpected about those questions?

256
00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:40.460
P11: Not really. It seemed pretty straightforward.

257
00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:44.819
Moderator: You can read this one for me. Please.

258
00:22:45.365 --> 00:22:54.630
P11: Do you currently smoke cigarettes? Please. Document recording cigarettes only not other forms of tobacco or e-cigarettes.

259
00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:56.630
P11: So.

260
00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:09.639
Moderator: Anything unexpected or unclear.

261
00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:15.129
P11: Yeah, yeah, I mean, I I would think that these would be 2

262
00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:21.729
P11: 2 separate questions, because I I really don't want to say yes to this, because of

263
00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:27.100
P11: never smoked. And this kind of looks like well, maybe I did. You know.

264
00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:28.140
Moderator: Yes.

265
00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:31.009
P11: So it's more just a personal, you know.

266
00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:35.940
P11: That'll work.

267
00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:45.563
P11: I I guess I just maybe I'm proud of the fact that I've never smoked. I don't wanna leave any room for you know.

268
00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:46.380
Moderator: Yes.

269
00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:47.040
P11: Oh!

270
00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:51.190
Moderator: Yeah, that makes sense. Thank you for that feedback.

271
00:23:53.320 --> 00:24:00.139
P11: Birming patient has never smoked cigarettes or smoked few than a hundred in the lifetime confirmed

272
00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:16.100
P11: sexual orientation. This question asks about your sexual orientation. All patients are asked about their sexual orientation.

273
00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:26.709
P11: so that preventative care to meet your health goals can be recommended. You may indicate more than one sexual orientation, or choose next, not to answer.

274
00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:34.869
Moderator: Okay. I'm gonna ask you to read it, but don't answer anything, because I I'd like you to do something else. But go.

275
00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:35.510
P11: Okay.

276
00:24:35.798 --> 00:24:38.679
Moderator: Just tell me your opinion of this page so far.

277
00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:41.110
P11: Yeah. Well, so far

278
00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:51.049
P11: every single sentence in here has the word sexual orientation in it. I don't know how else you would phrase that, but it just seems a little

279
00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:53.510
P11: little redundant, you know.

280
00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:53.840
Moderator: Okay.

281
00:24:54.060 --> 00:25:04.429
P11: So do you think of your sexual orientation as lesbian or gay, straight or heterosexual, bisexual, queer, prefer not to answer.

282
00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:08.759
Moderator: Unusual or unclear.

283
00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:19.860
P11: No, seems pretty good, I mean, you know, not not being in another category.

284
00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:23.230
P11: I don't know what other you know.

285
00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:31.510
P11: Categories there are so, but it seems to, you know, like I don't know the difference between this one

286
00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:33.030
P11: and this one.

287
00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:33.980
Moderator: Okay.

288
00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:36.259
P11: And this one I don't know.

289
00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:41.940
Moderator: Okay. So you should be more like, maybe. What would you like to see to?

290
00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:43.750
Moderator: To know.

291
00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:53.219
P11: Well, yeah, I I don't know. I I guess that would be better coming from someone who identifies with those terms. You know. I

292
00:25:54.008 --> 00:25:56.249
P11: not that up on it.

293
00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:58.810
Moderator: No.

294
00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:10.560
Moderator: So I'm gonna ask you to imagine that you just you're filling out this questionnaire. And you.

295
00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:10.960
P11: Just 3.

296
00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:16.180
Moderator: A call from a friend, and you really have to take that call.

297
00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:19.489
Moderator: But you're in the middle of filling this out.

298
00:26:20.359 --> 00:26:28.709
Moderator: So you plan to take the call and return to the questionnaire at a later time to finish it?

299
00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:30.269
Moderator: What would you do.

300
00:26:33.107 --> 00:26:45.240
P11: I wouldn't think I'd have to do anything. I I think, if I just left it here it would stay, cause I'm not really logged in per se, am I? Or I guess I am. Yeah.

301
00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:50.929
P11: Yeah, I don't see anything obvious here that would tell me

302
00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:57.169
P11: you know, to to save or.

303
00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:09.970
Moderator: So if that happened to you, what would you do? Let's say the call. Say, the calls took, you know, over a half an hour.

304
00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:12.839
Moderator: which what we expect to happen.

305
00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:19.570
P11: Well, ideally, I would just come back to it. It would be just right here where I left it.

306
00:27:19.570 --> 00:27:22.720
Moderator: So when you say Come back, do you mean just come back.

307
00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:24.140
P11: To my computer, yeah.

308
00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:25.570
Moderator: Back to your computer. Okay.

309
00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:26.230
P11: Yeah.

310
00:27:26.450 --> 00:27:29.069
Moderator: You expect the screen to still be up.

311
00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:30.340
P11: Yeah.

312
00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:40.430
Moderator: Okay, let's say you, let's say that you actually exited the experience.

313
00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:58.429
Moderator: And then you decide to come back. I'd I'd like to get your opinion on what happens next there. So I'm gonna ask you to exit the experience, but don't exit out of zoom. So do you know how you would exit

314
00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:01.010
Moderator: from here?

315
00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:03.350
P11: Not really.

316
00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:04.120
Moderator: Okay.

317
00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:05.620
P11: Change language.

318
00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:08.389
P11: I don't know what that is.

319
00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:12.859
Moderator: Okay, so- so that, okay, go ahead.

320
00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:17.520
P11: Don't know what ie. Is.

321
00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:23.920
Moderator: And you're free. Click on anything that you'd like

322
00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:30.110
Moderator: was that expected or unexpected?

323
00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:37.430
P11: It's okay. But I'm it's not what I what I was looking for.

324
00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:39.760
Moderator: What were you looking for.

325
00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:46.330
P11: Like save till later, or something, or save progress.

326
00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:48.549
Moderator: Okay. So all right.

327
00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:53.677
Moderator: So you wouldn't expect it to save unless you actually

328
00:28:55.210 --> 00:29:02.079
Moderator: It clicked on a button explicitly saying that you're you'd like it saved.

329
00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:07.789
P11: Well that that would give you some sense of comfort, you know.

330
00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:17.279
P11: knowing you don't have to start all over again. But if if I don't see that anywhere, I would just probably assume that it saves right where you were. You know.

331
00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:27.839
Moderator: Okay. So I'm gonna ask you to again exit the experience and let's try going up to the tab where it says, cure a patient

332
00:29:28.645 --> 00:29:32.999
Moderator: and then I'm gonna ask you to click on the X.

333
00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:35.415
P11: Okay,

334
00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:42.179
P11: like a.

335
00:29:42.610 --> 00:30:00.289
Moderator: So the tab on your your Google, like a like a Google tab, see it says Facebook, and then post attendee zoom, and then cure a patient up on top above the URL in your browser tabs. Yeah, excellent. Can you click on that? Let's see what that does.

336
00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:01.520
Moderator: So there.

337
00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:03.280
P11: Here.

338
00:30:03.570 --> 00:30:04.320
Moderator: So 2.

339
00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:06.249
P11: Down here, or well, no.

340
00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:09.139
Moderator: Yeah, you're so you were there.

341
00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:14.289
Moderator: So if you can get back to the tab in your browser that, says Kira.

342
00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:16.210
P11: Yes, this one.

343
00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:21.370
P11: Yeah, I don't know. Can I? Can I move this? Or it's like in the way you know.

344
00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:23.290
Moderator: Can you click.

345
00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:25.859
Moderator: Can you click on the X.

346
00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:28.290
P11: Oh, there we go.

347
00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:30.939
P11: Okay. Cure vet. I'm here.

348
00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:35.280
Moderator: Click on that x in that tab, there's an yeah. Let's see.

349
00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:40.820
Moderator: Yeah, now, I'm gonna ask. So that means you've exited the experience right.

350
00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:42.100
P11: All right.

351
00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:46.970
Moderator: So I'm gonna ask you to click on the link again in the chat.

352
00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:53.190
Moderator: Do you see the chat, the zoom chat function anywhere.

353
00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:56.180
P11: Yeah.

354
00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:06.070
P11: I clicked on it, but seem that anything's oh, wait! There it goes!

355
00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:19.370
Moderator: Okay, so what's your impression? Now?

356
00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:29.359
P11: Oh, I see it says I've completed these, but I haven't completed this one.

357
00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:31.990
Moderator: What do you think?

358
00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:32.590
Moderator: Alright!

359
00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:37.910
P11: Yeah, that's okay. I, I.

360
00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:42.570
Moderator: What would you have the like to see instead.

361
00:31:42.570 --> 00:31:47.639
P11: Well, I'm I'm old, so I I love

362
00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:52.160
P11: oops. I don't know what I did. I love when I see

363
00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:57.200
P11: like things like this date here.

364
00:31:57.870 --> 00:31:59.690
P11: A little bigger.

365
00:31:59.690 --> 00:32:01.079
Moderator: Okay, it's just okay.

366
00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:07.110
P11: Like I almost didn't notice those. And then, so I see

367
00:32:07.670 --> 00:32:09.869
P11: I need to complete this one.

368
00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:17.069
P11: But clicking on it doesn't do anything, and clicking. The date doesn't do anything.

369
00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:19.719
P11: so I guess I'll click here.

370
00:32:20.030 --> 00:32:20.480
Moderator: Okay.

371
00:32:23.770 --> 00:32:26.070
Moderator: is this what you expected to see.

372
00:32:28.108 --> 00:32:30.180
P11: Yeah, it works, yeah.

373
00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:34.690
Moderator: So again before you answer this question.

374
00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:39.169
P11: I'm going to ask you. Let's say you needed help.

375
00:32:41.254 --> 00:32:43.369
Moderator: With this questionnaire.

376
00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:46.659
Moderator: You're in the middle of it, and you have some questions.

377
00:32:47.010 --> 00:32:50.389
Moderator: Where would you go, or what would you do next?

378
00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:57.039
P11: Well, this button seemed to have some interesting things.

379
00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:01.830
P11: Nope.

380
00:33:07.270 --> 00:33:12.230
P11: see what? The oh, annotate. Okay. Don't want that

381
00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:18.552
P11: I'm stuck. No idea.

382
00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:20.340
Moderator: Okay.

383
00:33:21.450 --> 00:33:26.000
Moderator: So you don't see anything that could help you on this screen.

384
00:33:39.690 --> 00:33:41.250
P11: no, not really.

385
00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:42.175
Moderator: Okay?

386
00:33:43.150 --> 00:33:48.729
Moderator: All right, I'm gonna ask you to move on. Answer this question, please, and we can move on.

387
00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:59.710
Moderator: Is this what you expected to see.

388
00:34:01.945 --> 00:34:02.850
P11: Yeah.

389
00:34:03.510 --> 00:34:05.539
P11: Generally makes sense. Yeah.

390
00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:08.070
Moderator: Okay,

391
00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:14.410
Moderator: Can you just tell me what's going on? Then on the screen, now.

392
00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:16.550
P11: Well, it looks like

393
00:34:16.679 --> 00:34:26.949
P11: I'm assuming these are the questions that they wanted answered. So I'm assuming this is not something I need to. Really

394
00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:32.910
P11: it's just recommended. I I don't have time for that right now, you know.

395
00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:41.550
P11: Oh, so I guess I'm done.

396
00:34:42.110 --> 00:34:48.649
Moderator: Okay, alright. So you can go ahead and exit the

397
00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:53.050
Moderator: the prototype now. And I just have a few more questions for you.

398
00:34:53.050 --> 00:34:54.090
P11: Okay.

399
00:34:57.895 --> 00:35:03.920
Moderator: So can you just tell me your overall impression of this prototype?

400
00:35:07.261 --> 00:35:10.208
P11: Just felt a little clumsy to me.

401
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:16.460
P11: you know I have to say I I was a I was a web designer for.

402
00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:17.130
Moderator: Oh!

403
00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:24.149
P11: Almost 20 years before I retired. But you know, I I just you know, I I

404
00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:30.080
P11: I put user experience on A on a a very high priority

405
00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:32.590
P11: for all the websites I built. And

406
00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:44.812
P11: you know, that's why I appreciate what you're doing here, you know, trying to make it as user, friendly. And you know a good good experience as possible. And and

407
00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:50.879
P11: yeah, I I don't really know how I would describe it other than

408
00:35:51.550 --> 00:36:01.229
P11: it was generally a little confusing, because, like you said that the doctor sent me a link to a questionnaire, but nowhere on that page did I see the word

409
00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:02.940
P11: questionnaire, you know.

410
00:36:05.025 --> 00:36:06.270
Moderator: It was confusing.

411
00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:10.010
P11: Yeah, it. It switched terms like midstream.

412
00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:11.980
P11: And yeah.

413
00:36:14.498 --> 00:36:15.961
Moderator: Yeah. I think,

414
00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:23.350
P11: I don't know. The the layout was okay. I I just I don't know. It's not the way I would do it. So.

415
00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:31.089
Moderator: Okay, it's could you tell us what, how you would do it, or from your experience.

416
00:36:31.090 --> 00:36:31.870
P11: Yeah.

417
00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:38.729
Moderator: As a web designer. What- what have you found this, this prototype ship.

418
00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:46.739
P11: Well, yeah, I I mean, I would certainly have to, you know. Study and talk to.

419
00:36:47.544 --> 00:36:58.740
P11: you know the the users. A lot more to to, you know. Get a feel, for you know the best way to do it. But I I would just make it just very straightforward. You know you're

420
00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:06.490
P11: your provider, sent you a questionnaire or would like for you to complete the following questionnaires. And

421
00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:11.940
P11: and I mean the rest of the navigation is okay. But maybe it's just more of a wording thing.

422
00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:20.079
Moderator: So so when you say the navigation is okay, what's good and what- what is it.

423
00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:24.669
P11: Well, obviously the the link problem

424
00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:28.524
P11: is not something I would,

425
00:37:30.310 --> 00:37:35.026
P11: you know. Consider clear, you know, as far as navigation. But

426
00:37:35.890 --> 00:37:39.890
P11: You know how those individual would.

427
00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:43.048
P11: They didn't call them questionnaires, would they call them

428
00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:45.309
Moderator: Clinical reminders.

429
00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:51.745
P11: Reminders. Yeah, I don't know how they made that switch. But

430
00:37:53.530 --> 00:38:01.649
P11: you know the fact that they were links. That's a little confusing, because I would sit there and click on the link and think, oh, nothing's happening. I guess the website's down.

431
00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:02.790
Moderator: Okay.

432
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:07.848
P11: And you know, and probably give up at that point. But

433
00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:17.460
P11: so I I would probably either make those actual links or and then, once it's completed, then have the

434
00:38:18.117 --> 00:38:24.300
P11: information show up under the link that this has been completed, and

435
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:27.803
P11: remove the link at link at that point

436
00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:36.650
P11: or you know, if you if you want to keep the way it is, maybe where it says click, you know, click to

437
00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:41.389
P11: start to open reminders or something, or

438
00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:45.220
P11: I forget what that wording was. But you know you might just

439
00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:48.820
P11: I don't make it say something like, you know, to.

440
00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:53.560
P11: you know, to to begin the questionnaires click here.

441
00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:54.400
Moderator: Okay.

442
00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:56.490
Moderator: So when you say

443
00:38:56.710 --> 00:39:06.970
Moderator: when you said information, you so after you completed the experience, you said you wanted to see information underneath each questionnaire. What information was that.

444
00:39:07.350 --> 00:39:10.910
P11: All the the fact that it was completed in the date.

445
00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:11.890
Moderator: Okay.

446
00:39:11.890 --> 00:39:13.910
P11: Or just completed, you know.

447
00:39:14.130 --> 00:39:15.040
Moderator: Okay.

448
00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:25.610
Moderator: And so what did you think about the process of submitting the questionnaire? Do you feel like you've submitted it successfully or not?

449
00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:32.690
P11: I don't actually remember submitting it, did I? Yeah.

450
00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:35.537
Moderator: So so you don't feel like

451
00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:40.240
Moderator: after you completed the questionnaires that you've submitted. So

452
00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:43.470
Moderator: do you feel like it wasn't submitted at this point.

453
00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:49.960
P11: Well, it it could easily be that I it was just so automatic. I didn't even you know

454
00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:56.369
P11: it. It didn't stick in my memory. But I I really don't remember hitting like a submit button, or anything.

455
00:39:57.660 --> 00:40:02.090
Moderator: Like when it goes back to the, to the home, to that start page.

456
00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:07.579
P11: And it shows that everything's been completed with the dates.

457
00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:12.819
P11: I would think there'd be a submit button there, or something, or

458
00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:18.030
P11: I I don't know. You tell me, did I submit or not?

459
00:40:18.330 --> 00:40:26.505
Moderator: Yeah, no. So the you did know what your what your perception is.

460
00:40:27.090 --> 00:40:27.480
P11: Okay.

461
00:40:27.870 --> 00:40:30.670
Moderator: Yes, and so- so it wasn't clear.

462
00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:37.420
Moderator: Would you agree with that? So it wasn't clear to you that you actually submitted the the questionnaire.

463
00:40:38.090 --> 00:40:44.130
P11: Yeah, if I could remember. Maybe it was I I just I just really can't remember.

464
00:40:44.130 --> 00:40:45.179
Moderator: That's fine!

465
00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:45.850
P11: Yeah.

466
00:40:45.850 --> 00:40:46.919
P11: Hitting a submit.

467
00:40:47.350 --> 00:41:01.859
Moderator: Okay, so how do you feel about using this tool to answer questions about your personal health information? Do you feel safe and secure and- and- and just again

468
00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:07.129
Moderator: just repeating that this link was sent to you by your provider.

469
00:41:08.010 --> 00:41:16.430
Moderator: Email and so or text. So it wouldn't require authentication on because of that.

470
00:41:16.830 --> 00:41:17.660
P11: Right.

471
00:41:18.125 --> 00:41:22.310
Moderator: Just this prototype. How do you feel about that?

472
00:41:22.310 --> 00:41:28.320
P11: I mean I you know I've been. I've been dealing with the Va. For I don't know 12 or 15 years now, and it's

473
00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:36.719
P11: I've always felt that they do a pretty good job, you know, safeguarding privacy and personal information.

474
00:41:37.232 --> 00:41:41.299
P11: So I I would probably just go ahead and trust them. You know.

475
00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:42.035
Moderator: Okay.

476
00:41:43.086 --> 00:41:52.359
Moderator: as far as the questions we're gonna go back to the questions there was, you did mention that there was a few like repetitive

477
00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:56.879
Moderator: words. And also you mentioned that you didn't get enough.

478
00:41:57.310 --> 00:42:04.470
Moderator: You didn't get options that you would expect after you hit other exposures.

479
00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:05.270
P11: Right.

480
00:42:06.030 --> 00:42:13.350
Moderator: On a however, on a scale of one to 5, with one being very easy and 5 being very difficult.

481
00:42:13.570 --> 00:42:18.519
Moderator: How easy or difficult was it to answer each question?

482
00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:22.719
Moderator: Track with it.

483
00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:34.070
P11: Well to to I mean, you know, navigation wise to answer the question, and it was very simple, but my problem came in at a little bit with

484
00:42:34.350 --> 00:42:37.680
P11: what it was. They're actually asking me, you know.

485
00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:51.210
Moderator: And what? So when you say that, can you elaborate on that? A little more, was it? What- what was the problem? Was it that you didn't have enough information, or there was something there

486
00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:55.489
Moderator: that there wasn't anything there that you expect to be there.

487
00:42:56.140 --> 00:43:04.229
P11: Yeah, I mean, I I think it was just the the warning just seemed a little awkward. And I know you guys are working on the the wording and all that, too. I just

488
00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:17.829
P11: I mean, for the most part they were okay. It's just a few times like that. The one with sexual orientation, where, in the one short 3 sentence paragraph, it was spelled out 3 times, you know.

489
00:43:18.624 --> 00:43:21.780
P11: just a little awkward, I guess I felt.

490
00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:29.319
Moderator: So sexual orientation, would you rate it? a 1 or 5 1 being very easy, 5 being very difficult.

491
00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:33.550
P11: There's the one.

492
00:43:33.690 --> 00:43:36.930
Moderator: One. How about toxic exposure?

493
00:43:39.096 --> 00:43:43.150
P11: The the initial questions, or the the after.

494
00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:48.270
Moderator: Just all of the questions and any part of the questions.

495
00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:50.910
P11: I'd have to give that one about a 4.

496
00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:55.160
Moderator: Okay, and.

497
00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:59.550
P11: Had. I had expectations that weren't there, so.

498
00:43:59.730 --> 00:44:00.630
Moderator: Okay?

499
00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:06.650
Moderator: And how about tobacco year history? How would you rate that one through 5.

500
00:44:10.370 --> 00:44:14.259
P11: We'll go 3 with that because of the issue I described.

501
00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:19.899
Moderator: Can you just repeat that issue again? Really, quick.

502
00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:22.750
P11: All that. I've never smoked

503
00:44:23.050 --> 00:44:29.901
P11: slash less, or you know I've I've never smoked more than 100 cigarettes or something.

504
00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:31.660
Moderator: Okay.

505
00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:36.269
P11: That's just a personal thing that probably most people wouldn't have a problem with that.

506
00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:48.930
Moderator: Yeah, no, it's understandable that that you know. That's important to you. How about the homeless and food insecurity? One through 5 on that.

507
00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:53.950
P11: Let's go with a 5 on that. That was pretty good.

508
00:44:53.950 --> 00:44:57.300
Moderator: Oh, okay, so- so it's very easy.

509
00:44:57.300 --> 00:45:02.669
P11: Oh, wait, no, I'm sorry. Yeah. I went the wrong way on that. a 1 a one.

510
00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:13.580
Moderator: Alright. Let's see, I just have a few more questions. What did you think of the length of time to complete this experience? Was it reasonable or unreasonable?

511
00:45:15.559 --> 00:45:19.509
P11: It's reasonable. I mean, there really wasn't that much there I

512
00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:28.770
P11: if I if I had done it before and know what to expect I you know I probably could have done it in a minute or less. So.

513
00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:43.489
Moderator: Okay? And and how does this prototype compare to other questionnaires? Digital questionnaire platforms that you've interacted with in the past? Not necessarily Va, but just in general surveys or digital.

514
00:45:46.350 --> 00:45:47.300
P11: Hmm!

515
00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:53.690
P11: I'd say there's

516
00:45:53.820 --> 00:46:02.420
P11: some degree of awkwardness, maybe because it's a little a little outside the norm of what one would expect for a questionnaire.

517
00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:05.309
Moderator: So in that place.

518
00:46:05.470 --> 00:46:11.199
P11: Well, I I felt like I had to kind of concentrate a little more on what was being asked.

519
00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:15.869
P11: You know it wasn't so much in the answers that were offered

520
00:46:16.413 --> 00:46:24.989
P11: to check. But sometimes the questions themselves, I felt like I had to put more effort into figuring out what it was they were asking

521
00:46:25.523 --> 00:46:30.080
P11: and and not to a great degree. I'm just talking a very minor, you know.

522
00:46:31.547 --> 00:46:33.310
P11: Level of discomfort.

523
00:46:33.310 --> 00:46:37.940
Moderator: The layout. Ha! Contribute to that awkwardness at all.

524
00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:38.800
P11: In any.

525
00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:42.309
P11: No, I don't think so. I think layout was okay.

526
00:46:42.310 --> 00:46:55.250
Moderator: Okay, so if you could change just one thing about this entire experience and any part or step of this experience, what would that be?

527
00:46:57.200 --> 00:46:59.330
P11: Well, I I think the the

528
00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:05.759
P11: the the main point for me was the 1st page. You know the the in entry page or

529
00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:08.989
P11: not sure what you called it the home page, or

530
00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:17.070
P11: where it took me a while to figure out how I would actually move on.

531
00:47:18.221 --> 00:47:22.009
P11: I mean, you know, I I spent the 1st

532
00:47:22.530 --> 00:47:27.117
P11: 30 seconds just trying to figure out, okay, where's the questionnaire? You know.

533
00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:28.880
Moderator: No.

534
00:47:29.590 --> 00:47:35.710
P11: But that was in large part a wording thing, too, because they call them reminders, or something.

535
00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:41.740
Moderator: Okay, so do you think if the terminology would- would have been different, would you have?

536
00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:44.200
Moderator: We had a better?

537
00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:46.950
Moderator: Yes, and and starting.

538
00:47:47.730 --> 00:47:58.619
P11: Yeah, yeah, I think so. And and and if that you know, start start here to answer the questionnaires. You know, if that was a little more.

539
00:48:00.050 --> 00:48:05.090
P11: Clear somehow. I I'm not even sure how it could be. But

540
00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:11.049
P11: It's just, you know, when I 1st entered the page, and I was looking at it.

541
00:48:11.410 --> 00:48:13.880
P11: I never even saw that, you know.

542
00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:18.900
P11: Start does say start reminders or.

543
00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:20.169
Moderator: Our clinical reminder.

544
00:48:20.170 --> 00:48:21.440
P11: Yeah.

545
00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:38.550
Moderator: Okay, that's great feedback. Thank you. So finally, if you had to interact with this prototype on a regular basis, say, the Va. Had sent you questionnaires on a regular cadence, like every 3 months or so.

546
00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:56.843
Moderator: If you had to use this prototype to answer those questions every time, how satisfied or unsatisfied would you be with one being very satisfied, and 5 being very dissatisfied, and of course 3 would be in the middle.

547
00:48:57.310 --> 00:48:58.220
P11: Yeah.

548
00:48:58.450 --> 00:49:05.640
P11: Well, I I think if the answers align better with with what I would want to say.

549
00:49:05.930 --> 00:49:11.090
P11: I would give it a 1 as is. I'm probably saying a 3.

550
00:49:11.350 --> 00:49:20.619
Moderator: Okay? And and that's not really the-, the prototype itself. Am I understanding you correctly? It's actually the questions, is that what you.

551
00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:22.160
P11: Right, right.

552
00:49:22.970 --> 00:49:27.290
Moderator: Alright, that's all I have today. [redacted PII] , do you have any questions for me?

553
00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:40.550
P11: No, I and you know, I I'd like that. You guys are doing this because I'd much rather fill something out on the computer than you know. Get get lots of papers and have to, you know.

554
00:49:40.690 --> 00:49:45.830
P11: check boxes off with my actual hand and and pen, and

555
00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:49.300
P11: you know, mail it back, and all that. That's so.

556
00:49:49.890 --> 00:49:54.439
Moderator: So you you like to have in a digital version. That's great feedback.

557
00:49:54.440 --> 00:49:55.080
P11: Yeah.

558
00:49:55.080 --> 00:50:08.169
Moderator: So your feedback was very helpful. I just wanna reiterate that nothing we did today will affect your health care or your benefits in any way, since it was just a prototype.

559
00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:09.280
P11: Yeah.

560
00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:18.159
Moderator: So. Lastly, Perry, Jean will be sending you a thank you. Note with a little blurb, that you can pass along to other veterans, that you may know.

561
00:50:18.370 --> 00:50:18.810
P11: Giving.

562
00:50:18.810 --> 00:50:25.259
Moderator: The opportunity to participate in future research studies with us, we'd greatly appreciate that.

563
00:50:26.260 --> 00:50:32.889
Moderator: thank you again. And and actually, do you have any questions.

564
00:50:32.890 --> 00:50:35.070
Notetaker: Questions for me. Thank you so.

565
00:50:35.070 --> 00:50:36.140
Notetaker: Oh, it wasn't you.

566
00:50:36.140 --> 00:50:36.530
Moderator: Okay.

567
00:50:36.530 --> 00:50:41.489
P11: Oh, thanks, [Notetaker], I miss. I miss seeing your face, but

568
00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:44.839
P11: just knowing you're there is is comforting.

569
00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:45.710
P11: Oh, thank you.

570
00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:49.109
Moderator: So have a good day, [redacted PII] .

571
00:50:49.110 --> 00:50:51.339
P11: You, too. Thanks! Take care!

572
00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:52.420
Moderator: Take care!

573
00:50:58.770 --> 00:51:00.870
P11: I don't know how to sign off.

574
00:51:01.470 --> 00:51:03.220
Moderator: So if you go back to the zoom.

575
00:51:03.220 --> 00:51:07.965
P11: Oh, there we go. Stop share, I guess. Yeah, okay.

576
00:51:08.670 --> 00:51:12.739
Moderator: And then think you can leave the the Zoom Meeting.

577
00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:16.949
P11: Oh, there it is! Leave okay. Alright! Take care! Bye-bye.
