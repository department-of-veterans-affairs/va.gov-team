00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:00.690
Moderator: And

2
00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:09.649
Moderator: great. So now that I've started recording, I wanna just confirm again. Are you comfortable with me, recording my screen and audio today?

3
00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:10.470
P8: I am.

4
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:27.020
Moderator: Great. Okay? So before I send you this link, I just want to ask some intro questions. So have you ever filled out health questionnaires from your Va. Provider, either during your appointment or through email or text.

5
00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.330
P8: I have. Yes.

6
00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.329
Moderator: Okay? And can you tell me about your experience?

7
00:00:33.365 --> 00:00:42.759
P8: Usually they're mailed, and their bubble question or, excuse me, Bubble, answer type questions.

8
00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.780
Moderator: Okay.

9
00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.009
Moderator: And how do you feel about filling those out.

10
00:00:52.590 --> 00:01:00.050
P8: I I do what I'm supposed to do, but I think it's a little irrelevant. I'm not sure anything is actually done with them.

11
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:08.399
Moderator: Oh, okay, do you remember? Like what kind of questions you've been asked that you've been like, uncertain about.

12
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:17.830
P8: I think it was I. The last one I did was really long, and asked like

13
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:26.999
P8: medicine questions symptom questions, just as you would, sitting in front of your own physician.

14
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.620
Moderator: Hmm, but just on paper.

15
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:30.510
P8: Correct.

16
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:41.880
Moderator: Got it. Okay? So today, we're going to pretend that you have a doctor's appointment in 2 days and your doctor emailed you some health questionnaires to complete online before your

17
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.070
Moderator: employment.

18
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.889
P8: I have done an email one, too. Now that you mention it.

19
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.000
Moderator: Oh, okay. What was that like.

20
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.680
P8: I like it better.

21
00:01:52.705 --> 00:01:53.410
P8: I

22
00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:02.210
P8: I can't give you a hundred percent, but I feel like it came from the case manager. So I knew it went somewhere.

23
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.779
Moderator: Oh, okay, you knew someone was actually gonna read it.

24
00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:06.660
P8: Yes, ma'am.

25
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.810
Moderator: Yeah. And was that on a computer or phone that you filled it out.

26
00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.499
P8: I I mean, I just did it by phone. I have all my Va apps on my phone.

27
00:02:19.073 --> 00:02:23.070
Moderator: And do you use any accessibility features on your phone.

28
00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.000
P8: Email.

29
00:02:27.594 --> 00:02:36.389
Moderator: great. Okay. So, since you've done that before. Hopefully, this should seem kind of familiar

30
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:57.510
Moderator: these questions may or may not be related to your upcoming appointment, and some of the questions you might have seen before, while others might be new. And I'm going to have you once you open it up, just look through each screen, think out loud, tell me what you think of it, and if there's anything you find confusing or just weird.

31
00:02:57.881 --> 00:03:11.999
Moderator: And I'll also ask you a few questions on each screen before you click to the next one, and just a reminder that this is a demo, so your answers aren't going to affect you or your benefits.

32
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.660
P8: Okay.

33
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.649
Moderator: Yeah. And are you? I see in the text, is this an iphone that you're using.

34
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:18.320
P8: It is.

35
00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:25.610
Moderator: Okay and oh, I guess we'll see when you open it up. If it's safari or chrome, or whatever.

36
00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:26.200
P8: Cool.

37
00:03:26.685 --> 00:03:36.420
Moderator: Okay, so I'm gonna put this link in the chat. But before you open it, wanna ask you to just confirm that. You see, there's a link now.

38
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:37.409
P8: I do?

39
00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.400
Moderator: Okay, and if you could share your screen.

40
00:03:41.491 --> 00:03:45.879
Moderator: so I think it should be at the very bottom of your zoom. There should be a share button.

41
00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:56.460
Moderator: and then there should be like a list of things that comes up, and you'll want to click the one that says screen.

42
00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.090
P8: So before I open it.

43
00:03:59.764 --> 00:04:04.169
Moderator: Yes, cause once you're sharing, I can help you navigate a little bit better.

44
00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:13.060
P8: So when I open where the chat is not not the link, but where the chat is.

45
00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:19.710
P8: At the top. It says, what the questionnaire new messages has you?

46
00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.749
P8: And then under it it has, like a normal text area. If you would.

47
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.959
P8: and then the sent button. I don't see what you're talking about.

48
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:35.700
Moderator: Oh, so share screen that button isn't going to be in the chat. Could you close the chat.

49
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.290
P8: Okay. Oh, okay. I got you.

50
00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.540
Moderator: Okay, and then there should be a share button at the bottom.

51
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:47.450
P8: Yeah, okay, I thought you were saying the chat. Okay, so screen start.

52
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.580
P8: Okay.

53
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:58.459
Moderator: Perfect. Okay. And now, if you can go back to like our faces.

54
00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.299
Moderator: okay. So there's a chat button at the bottom. If you could click on that link

55
00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:12.110
Moderator: perfect, and you can still see me.

56
00:05:12.562 --> 00:05:17.570
Moderator: But if that gets in the way you can feel free to like minimize my face.

57
00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:19.265
Moderator: And

58
00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:21.410
Moderator: Oh.

59
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.169
Moderator: I think we need to return to your browser where the question opened up.

60
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.760
Moderator: Okay, and is this safari or chrome.

61
00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:39.420
P8: Row.

62
00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:40.450
Moderator: Chrome.

63
00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:41.010
P8: Yep.

64
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:42.870
Moderator: Good to know.

65
00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:46.609
P8: Keeps bouncing me out. Man.

66
00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:48.380
P8: Okay.

67
00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:56.799
Moderator: Okay. I might. I wonder if I turn off my video? If it'll make sure that you can see the whole page. Let me see

68
00:05:58.547 --> 00:06:02.419
Moderator: oh, no, it's still blocking it. I wonder if.

69
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:06.210
P8: I tried to. I tried to tap on it, and that's what took me back out.

70
00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:14.719
Moderator: Yeah. Well, if you don't mind, I think that should be fine. It might just mean you need to scroll down a little bit more to see all the text.

71
00:06:15.373 --> 00:06:16.380
P8: That's fine!

72
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.880
Moderator: Okay, So

73
00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:30.670
Moderator: now that you've opened up this web page, I just want to get your 1st impressions. What do you see? And what do you think about it?

74
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:36.200
P8: The Va. Branding is awful.

75
00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:37.430
Moderator: Oh, okay.

76
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.180
P8: It's not. It's not normal. Va, branding.

77
00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:44.039
Moderator: Hmm, yeah. What do you notice is like, off.

78
00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:51.700
P8: That usually it's like that

79
00:06:52.168 --> 00:06:59.389
P8: isn't the emblem usually there. I'm used to opening up to the like my healthy bed, and it looks a little different.

80
00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:07.919
Moderator: Yeah, yeah, definitely, this is, yeah, that's helpful to know, how does that make you feel about this

81
00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:09.180
Moderator: site?

82
00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:18.020
P8: Without that cookie cutter branding, and this cure event at the top.

83
00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:19.610
Moderator: Hmm.

84
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:25.129
P8: It does. It just doesn't look similar to any other Va site.

85
00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.279
Moderator: Yeah, yeah, that's good feedback.

86
00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.609
P8: And then it says, Hello, outpatient!

87
00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:41.020
P8: I mean, I would, I would assume I'm logging in, so it should say, like Hello, [redacted PII].

88
00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:53.260
Moderator: Yes, so the way this would work is that in your email you get a 1 time Link, that's just for you. And so there, you wouldn't have to log in.

89
00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:55.880
Moderator: but it would know when you click on it.

90
00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:59.410
Moderator: That it's for you, and it would say, Hello, [redacted PII].

91
00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:00.950
P8: Yeah.

92
00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:11.890
P8: Otherwise. I mean the reminders. Fine start clinical reminders. I don't know exactly what that means. I would assume you just click on the reminder.

93
00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:22.220
P8: but recommended education. The resources, like I don't even is

94
00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:28.160
P8: are those education and the Va. Whole health resource? I don't even think that's on brand.

95
00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:30.390
Moderator: Yeah. Yeah.

96
00:08:32.059 --> 00:08:35.319
P8: So my preference would be like use. Icons that are on brand.

97
00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:38.059
Moderator: Yes, yes, that's good feedback.

98
00:08:39.086 --> 00:08:46.370
Moderator: Okay. So now that we've taken a look at this page, you can go ahead and start answering the reminders.

99
00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:50.419
P8: So do I hit start.

100
00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.140
Moderator: Whatever you think you should do.

101
00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:55.600
P8: Yep.

102
00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:05.170
Moderator: I realized that my video is kind of in the way, yeah.

103
00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:07.210
P8: I'll just answer what I can do.

104
00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:09.030
Moderator: Okay,

105
00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:17.150
Moderator: I think I might be in the way of the next button. So if you move me to the left.

106
00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:19.779
Moderator: there we go? Or yeah up top.

107
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:21.420
Moderator: Okay?

108
00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:31.690
Moderator: Oh, did you click previous.

109
00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:33.859
P8: I did.

110
00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:38.379
P8: I just wanted to see can I go next or no?

111
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:47.810
Moderator: Yeah, so this is this is a bug where, if you don't change the

112
00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:52.680
Moderator: selection, it won't let you move forward. And so if you could. Just

113
00:09:53.628 --> 00:09:59.349
Moderator: oh, no! But then you don't get to see it. Could you tell me why you went to the previous button?

114
00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:06.929
P8: Because it said, Thank you for telling us your concern. I didn't tell them my concern. I just answered a question.

115
00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:08.410
Moderator: Hmm.

116
00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:15.169
P8: It was a have you experienced because of Xyz things? Yes or no?

117
00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:20.339
P8: But then it said, Thank you for telling us your concern, and I was double checking

118
00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:23.430
P8: like I wasn't really telling you a concern.

119
00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:32.439
Moderator: Yeah, yeah. So what? You? What would you have expected to see next?

120
00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:34.769
P8: Just a question.

121
00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:40.070
Moderator: Yeah. So the question that was below it, which might have gotten cut off

122
00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:45.559
Moderator: was, which of the following toxic exposures have you experienced.

123
00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:48.730
P8: Think, taking away the fluff.

124
00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:53.890
P8: This, and just having like on this page. You see, it's just the question.

125
00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:57.580
P8: Just make it the question.

126
00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:00.499
Moderator: Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.

127
00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:05.689
Moderator: Okay, so we can continue moving through the questions.

128
00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:17.750
Moderator: Yeah. And at any point, if you have feedback. Just speak out loud. We're really you, too.

129
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:18.250
Moderator: Just.

130
00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:22.350
P8: I think you should use the word veteran instead of people.

131
00:11:25.655 --> 00:11:38.109
Moderator: Yes, yes, and that is good feedback. I forgot to mention what we're really trying to get feedback on right now is the like, the flow and the layout

132
00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:48.369
Moderator: and so less so the wording, the wording definitely needs work. But we really just want to focus on like the process of going through the questions.

133
00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:49.100
P8: Okay.

134
00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:39.890
Moderator: Yeah. I noticed that you were going back and forth between those 2 questions. Could you tell me what you were thinking.

135
00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:47.689
P8: The only thing I mean this doesn't have to do with flow, and just was like sometimes true, never true.

136
00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:50.220
P8: I don't understand why it's just not yes or no.

137
00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:55.390
P8: Yes, no, some yes, no, maybe like, or some like.

138
00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:00.449
Moderator: Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.

139
00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:10.829
P8: Also the yeah. Sorry. I'm just going through.

140
00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:13.170
Moderator: No, give me your feedback, give me your feedback.

141
00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:14.840
P8: So the asterisk.

142
00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:19.110
P8: There's no place that describes the asterisk.

143
00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:22.610
Moderator: Oh, the red asterisk!

144
00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:23.560
P8: Yes, ma'am.

145
00:13:24.771 --> 00:13:27.980
Moderator: Okay, yeah. Have you seen that before?

146
00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.579
P8: An asterisk.

147
00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:32.550
Moderator: The red asterisk.

148
00:13:35.092 --> 00:13:44.039
P8: I mean a red one, but I've seen one where usually, if there's there is one present, there's a disclaimer describing what it is.

149
00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:44.970
Moderator: Yeah, yeah.

150
00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:47.140
P8: For clarification purposes.

151
00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:49.260
Moderator: Yeah, that's a good point.

152
00:13:49.763 --> 00:13:57.039
Moderator: I think here it means that it's a required question. But yeah, it doesn't. It's a good point that it doesn't explain that anywhere.

153
00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:03.979
P8: So like maybe on the front end that needs to be defined.

154
00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:06.880
Moderator: Yeah, yeah, that's a good point.

155
00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:08.730
Moderator: Great.

156
00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:16.459
Moderator: Okay, before we move on to this question, do you have any feedback about those tobacco? Use questions.

157
00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:19.140
P8: Not that I already provided no.

158
00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:20.710
Moderator: Okay. Cool.

159
00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.560
P8: And just kind of same thing here.

160
00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:31.399
Moderator: Just opened.

161
00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:33.369
P8: Just click, through.

162
00:14:34.468 --> 00:14:38.939
Moderator: Or tell me if you have any feedback, and then you can go ahead and click through.

163
00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:53.980
P8: No.

164
00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:59.470
Moderator: Could you? Tell me about why you chose? Prefer not to answer.

165
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:01.519
P8: I I just chose.

166
00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:14.210
P8: I think, on all the slides you should get rid of that red asterisk, and just at the end, if somebody doesn't answer a question. It bounces you back to that question.

167
00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:15.640
Moderator: Hmm,

168
00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:19.689
P8: Or something of that nature, because it's just weird.

169
00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:21.800
Moderator: Yeah, yeah,

170
00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:35.680
Moderator: that makes sense. So you've gone through all of the questions already. And I just want to ask a quick, hypothetical, which is that? Let's say you were going through that

171
00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:42.670
Moderator: toxic exposure one again and you saw that like that next button wasn't working.

172
00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:44.699
Moderator: and you wanted to get help.

173
00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:49.439
Moderator: How would you want to get help on this site?

174
00:15:51.896 --> 00:15:56.269
P8: I kinda like when there's a floating help button.

175
00:15:57.900 --> 00:15:59.179
P8: Or a chat.

176
00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:07.889
Moderator: Yeah. And do you prefer like, if it's a real person, or if it's AI.

177
00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:17.519
P8: I mean, if AI can solve my problem, I don't care if if it's coded

178
00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:21.809
P8: to be able to solve those type of problems. It should be pretty basic.

179
00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:27.690
Moderator: Hmm, yeah. So as long as it actually helps you, it doesn't matter.

180
00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:30.190
Moderator: Got it.

181
00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:42.789
Moderator: Okay, and then that's all for this page. And I'm just going to have you stop sharing screen, and I have a few questions for you before we wrap up

182
00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:47.010
Moderator: great.

183
00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:47.560
P8: Okay.

184
00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:57.039
Moderator: Okay, so I'm going to ask more like general questions. Can you tell me about your overall impression of the prototype?

185
00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:01.820
P8: Overall.

186
00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:05.319
P8: It seems like it does what it's supposed to do.

187
00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:13.220
P8: Obviously, I think the back button should work on every single screen.

188
00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:15.060
Moderator: Hmm.

189
00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:18.320
P8: It would be nice at the end.

190
00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:25.069
P8: After you make your final submission that there's a

191
00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:36.660
P8: then you can do your thank you like. Thank you for providing that this information, or have, like a green submitted button, or something like that, to indicate we're done.

192
00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:40.020
Moderator: Yeah.

193
00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:45.179
P8: And then other other than that the branding? Because if I go to the Va. Whole Health Department

194
00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:50.629
P8: and I look at your screen, they're gonna be different.

195
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:59.039
Moderator: Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. Are there any other parts that didn't match what you thought should happen?

196
00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:18.139
Moderator: Oh, I think it might have frozen.

197
00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:23.669
P8: Oh, no, ma'am, I think otherwise. Those are my only feedback.

198
00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:29.229
Moderator: Oh, okay, sorry. I think it stopped. For like a second I just wanted to make sure.

199
00:18:29.895 --> 00:18:38.749
Moderator: Okay. And how do you feel about using this type of tool to answer questions about your personal health information like, did you feel like it was safe or.

200
00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:39.739
P8: As long as they.

201
00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:43.070
Moderator: It's what.

202
00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:47.569
P8: Use? Do all this.

203
00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:50.040
Moderator: Oh!

204
00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:51.550
P8: Can you repeat?

205
00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:59.810
Moderator: Yeah, how did you feel about using this type of tool to answer your personal health information? Did you feel like it was safe and secure.

206
00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:05.040
P8: As long as it comes from a BA

207
00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:11.050
P8: vetted entity like if it's in my healthy bed, or something of that nature.

208
00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:11.875
Moderator: Hmm!

209
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:17.049
Moderator: How would you feel if it just came through your email? But from like a Va email.

210
00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:22.680
P8: I would question if it's legitimate.

211
00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:24.085
Moderator: Hmm,

212
00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:29.879
Moderator: What would make you feel like? It was legitimate. If it was through email.

213
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:35.350
P8: If I have to log in with my like login Id, or

214
00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:40.999
P8: the same login procedures as you would use to access your medical records.

215
00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:44.963
Moderator: that makes sense. And then

216
00:19:46.138 --> 00:19:53.109
Moderator: what do you think about the length of time? It took to complete the experience was it reasonable or unreasonable.

217
00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:58.160
P8: No, it's fine. It would have took me like a couple of seconds worth talking about. It.

218
00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:05.650
Moderator: Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. And how does this compare to that other email questionnaire you filled out before.

219
00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:09.400
P8: I

220
00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:19.466
P8: that one? I would prefer that one, because, like I said it was, it was very on Brand. You could tell it was coming from the Va.

221
00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:21.730
P8: I almost want to say

222
00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:29.769
P8: it was through secure message. Possibly I I can't quite remember, though it's been a while.

223
00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:36.089
Moderator: Hmm, yeah, that's good to know? And then

224
00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:41.210
Moderator: if you could change one thing about the entire questionnaire, experience, what would it be.

225
00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:53.330
P8: I don't think anything I mean, I assume there's gonna be like

226
00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:59.889
P8: other questions, or whatever the particular need is for that individual.

227
00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:03.029
Moderator: Hmm, yeah. Yeah.

228
00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:17.980
Moderator: And if you had to interact with this prototype to answer questions about your healthcare on a regular basis, like every 3 months or so. How satisfied or dissatisfied would you be.

229
00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:28.559
P8: I would be fine. I probably would appreciate, like in the menu and option to see like previous submissions.

230
00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:34.340
Moderator: Hmm just to make sure you're consistent or.

231
00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:41.469
P8: I just I don't know like it's nice to be able to go back and look at

232
00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:44.029
P8: different things that you've done.

233
00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:48.020
Moderator: Yeah. Could you tell me more about why?

234
00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:57.510
P8: I mean, for example, in my medical record, I can go back and look at what labs I got drawn and.

235
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:58.200
Moderator: Hmm.

236
00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:01.969
P8: This week this week this week this week.

237
00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:07.390
P8: If I'm curious, I have that basic information available to me.

238
00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:15.869
Moderator: Yes, yes, that makes sense. So it's more to be able to view a history and less about helping you fill out your current question.

239
00:22:16.525 --> 00:22:17.180
P8: Yeah.

240
00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:37.720
Moderator: Okay, that makes sense. And then last set of questions, I just wanna ask you for each one of those 4 reminders how easy or difficult it was to go through them, and so I'll ask on a scale of like very easy, easy, neither

241
00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:40.830
Moderator: difficult or very difficult.

242
00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:41.890
P8: It's easy.

243
00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:43.740
Moderator: For all 4.

244
00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:44.590
P8: Okay.

245
00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:47.530
Moderator: Okay, great.

246
00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:51.909
Moderator: And then, before we wrap up, do you have any questions for me?

247
00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:54.069
P8: Well, I just want to clarify.

248
00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:54.850
Moderator: Yes.

249
00:22:54.850 --> 00:23:01.859
P8: I would assume if you're getting these like like you suggested every 3 months, or whatever.

250
00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:02.410
Moderator: Hmm.

251
00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:09.029
P8: They're not all this questionnaire. They vary and are sent to you by your doctor, or whatever entity correct.

252
00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:13.480
Moderator: Yeah, they'd be at whatever cadence like. Makes sense for your like healthcare.

253
00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.190
P8: Got you? Okay? Yep.

254
00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:16.210
Moderator: Yeah, yeah,

255
00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:21.990
Moderator: And then I'm just gonna ask [Notetaker] if she has any questions.

256
00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:25.430
Notetaker: Thank you very much, [redacted PII].

257
00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:26.045
P8: Yep.

258
00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:39.270
Moderator: Okay, awesome. Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on these experiences and make sure they really work for veterans

259
00:23:39.400 --> 00:24:03.479
Moderator: before you go, just wanted to reiterate that everything you filled out today wasn't real. So the questions that you answered are not going to be submitted to your provider or anywhere else. And lastly, Perigan, who set up this meeting is going to send you a thank you. Note with a little blurb, that you can pass along to other veterans, you may know to provide them the chance to participate in research like this.

260
00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:04.460
P8: Okay.

261
00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:08.330
Moderator: And then that's all. Thank you so much.

262
00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:10.160
P8: Alright. Thank you so much. Guys.

263
00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:11.780
Moderator: Thank you, enjoy your day.

264
00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:12.930
P8: Thank you.

265
00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:13.860
Moderator: Bye.
