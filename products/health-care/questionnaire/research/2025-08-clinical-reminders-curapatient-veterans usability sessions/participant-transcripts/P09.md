00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:09.950
Moderator: So, is it okay with you that we record this audio and video while you interact with the prototype today.

2
00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:10.829
P9: Yes, it is.

3
00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:12.360
Moderator: Okay, excellent.

4
00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:26.309
Moderator: So I'm just going to ask you a few questions. Have you responded to health questionnaires that your doctor may have sent to you, either through email text, or even during your appointment.

5
00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.749
Moderator: I actually don't recall receiving any of those so.

6
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.620
P9: To answer your question? No.

7
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:35.780
Moderator: No. Okay.

8
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:36.599
P9: That's my knowledge. Now.

9
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.109
Moderator: So even at when you're waiting in the doctor's appointment, you don't fill out anything.

10
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.960
P9: Not that I can recall, anyway. No.

11
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:44.410
Moderator: Alright.

12
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:46.510
Moderator: So

13
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:59.040
Moderator: so now, like, I said, we're gonna pretend that you're going to be interacting with the real prototype that your Va doctor had sent to you either email or text.

14
00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:06.895
Moderator: So we're gonna pretend that it's 2. You have a doctor's appointment 2 days before. And

15
00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:36.169
Moderator: also these questions that he sent you may or may not be related to your health care appointment. It could be just general overall health questionnaires that the Va. Is looking to get information about your health conditions. So some of these questions may be familiar to you. And some may not. So when I send you the prototype in the

16
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.059
Moderator: chat. Do you know where the chat function is?

17
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.910
P9: Yes.

18
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:51.010
Moderator: Okay. So I'm I'm gonna send it to you now. And what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna ask you to share your screen before you click on the prototype.

19
00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.269
Moderator: So do you see the link there.

20
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.290
P9: Yep.

21
00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.359
Moderator: Okay, so can you share your screen for me?

22
00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.010
Moderator: And are you able to access the chat.

23
00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.290
P9: Yes, I've actually never had to share my screen before. So just.

24
00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:28.910
Moderator: Okay, so it should be in the zoom. Okay, so go ahead and click on the prototype.

25
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.289
Moderator: But when you click on it don't do anything else until I ask you to.

26
00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:50.149
Moderator: And can I ask you? You can go ahead and and allow

27
00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.869
Moderator: what browser are you using today?

28
00:02:54.482 --> 00:02:55.449
P9: This is safari.

29
00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.129
Moderator: Okay? And are you interact? And what- what device are you using.

30
00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.149
P9: This is an apple laptop.

31
00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.200
Moderator: Laptop. Okay.

32
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.470
P9: The Mac ios.

33
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:16.340
Moderator: Alright. So think of this link that your physician sent you as being your link with all your credentials in here so

34
00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.230
Moderator: overall. What's your 1st impression. After opening the link.

35
00:03:22.845 --> 00:03:24.089
P9: Well, it's new.

36
00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.179
P9: It's not something I've looked at before. But it's minimal.

37
00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.910
P9: It's not. It's not busy.

38
00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:37.849
Moderator: Okay, is this what? You expected it to see something like this or no?

39
00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.560
P9: Coming from the Va. Sure.

40
00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.550
Moderator: Yes, okay.

41
00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:49.420
Moderator: So what I'm gonna ask you to do now is, I'm gonna ask you to read some of these.

42
00:03:49.720 --> 00:04:00.980
Moderator: And and after you finish reading this screen. Don't read everything. Just read the major things. I'm gonna ask you to start the experience.

43
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:05.180
P9: Okay.

44
00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.440
Moderator: And when you're ready you can start.

45
00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.430
P9: And so by by starting, you might want somebody to read what's on the screen, or what I see on the screen.

46
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.950
Moderator: Yeah. Why don't you go ahead and start the experience.

47
00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:21.629
P9: Okay?

48
00:04:28.351 --> 00:04:32.739
P9: So clinical reminders toxic exposure screener.

49
00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:36.809
Moderator: Homelessness and food, insecurity reminder.

50
00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:42.870
Moderator: And it's not important out loud also with what you're doing.

51
00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:50.560
P9: I'm just going through the list of my reminders. Here, let me start new.

52
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:59.740
Moderator: Okay, before we move on. Could you tell me a little bit of about your experience in the last page before you move on to this page?

53
00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:05.429
P9: Oh, sure! Just a list of just like lesser reminders.

54
00:05:06.094 --> 00:05:09.759
P9: I think I actually have seen these are questions asked about this in the past.

55
00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:20.609
Moderator: And did you expect, when you were going through each reminder? Did you expect to see or- or do anything.

56
00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.480
P9: Well, I did click on these individual reminders.

57
00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:28.410
P9: and nothing happens. But am I right? Yeah, I've seen like the dates.

58
00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:29.900
Moderator: Okay?

59
00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:39.960
Moderator: And so when you clicked on these reminders, were you ex expecting to start that reminder? Or what were you expecting to happen after you clicked on that.

60
00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:46.250
P9: Well, I'm giving like the different cursor. So I was expecting, maybe, like a a sub menu from each of these.

61
00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:47.000
Moderator: Okay.

62
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.480
P9: But then that's why I clicked on the start. Clinical reminders.

63
00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:54.059
Moderator: Okay, okay, we're gonna ask you to move on, please.

64
00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.740
P9: Okay.

65
00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.710
Moderator: So I'm gonna ask you to read the question.

66
00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:08.610
Moderator: and before you answer it it, I'm just gonna ask you another question.

67
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.769
P9: Do you think you're exposed to any toxins or other hazards while serving in the armed forces.

68
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.139
Moderator: You can read the options to.

69
00:06:18.517 --> 00:06:28.340
P9: Options or the toxic exposures include agent orange, airborne hazards, open burn pits, contaminated water at Camp Lejeune Gulf. War related exposures, radiation or other exposures.

70
00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:33.099
Moderator: Okay, is there anything unexpected or unclear on the screen.

71
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:34.130
P9: No.

72
00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.220
Moderator: What would you do next if I wasn't here?

73
00:06:38.302 --> 00:06:40.979
P9: I would do. Yes, I'll click. Yes.

74
00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:42.410
Moderator: Go ahead.

75
00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:45.959
Moderator: I'm gonna ask you to move on.

76
00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:46.500
P9: Okay.

77
00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:51.370
Moderator: Go ahead and start.

78
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:55.310
Moderator: You can look through if you'd like, and.

79
00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:56.430
P9: Let's

80
00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:05.339
P9: But click all that. Apply. Okay, airborne hazards, radiation, perhaps.

81
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.609
Moderator: What do you think of before you move on? What do you think of the screen.

82
00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:18.460
P9: I don't really think anything. It just has the the some of the options.

83
00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:21.349
Moderator: Okay. So you said, some of the options.

84
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:24.010
P9: Yeah, like, what is other other exposures?

85
00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:28.760
P9: There, there's that menu or option for other exposures in the previous screen.

86
00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:33.210
Moderator: So did you expect to see something else than what you're seeing now?

87
00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:36.729
P9: Yeah, like, I would have liked to have seen the other exposures cause. That's probably what I would have.

88
00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:42.200
P9: I probably would have just done the airborne hazards with other exposures.

89
00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:51.009
Moderator: So when you say you would have liked to seen the other exposures. Can you elaborate? Can you clarify what you mean by that? Please?

90
00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:52.570
P9: Well, I guess

91
00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:58.960
P9: even I was never deployed to a combat zone. But even then, even during training or

92
00:07:59.935 --> 00:08:03.680
P9: for support missions, you're just exposed to

93
00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:11.419
P9: with with it just a whole slew of stuff like whether it be fumes from a vehicle

94
00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:18.039
P9: or the various grenades, various explosives, ammunition.

95
00:08:19.019 --> 00:08:23.659
P9: stuff like that, so the other, the other exposures probably would have fit me best.

96
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:25.360
Moderator: Okay.

97
00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:29.440
P9: Although I guess the airborne hazards with the Burn pit

98
00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:35.510
P9: plus the radiation is fine. But yeah, the other exposures I probably would just click other exposures.

99
00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:45.690
Moderator: And then what would you have expect to happen after you clicked other exposures like, what would you have liked to see? And you mentioned all of those

100
00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:53.679
Moderator: toxins and exposures. But what would you have liked to seen on the screen, instead of what you're seeing now?

101
00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:03.349
P9: I guess the screen is fine, but just like I said, just the option of the other. The other exposures.

102
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:12.939
Moderator: Okay, so option meaning, would you like to have maybe a list of exposures, or maybe an open text field where you would enter your.

103
00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:14.400
P9: A list. A list for sure.

104
00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:17.660
Moderator: Okay. Alright, I'm gonna ask you to move on, please.

105
00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:32.609
Moderator: Is there anything unexpected about this screen?

106
00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:35.200
P9: Just the spelling error.

107
00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:36.900
P9: But no.

108
00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:42.390
Moderator: Right.

109
00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:48.319
Moderator: Would you have liked to seen something else.

110
00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:55.289
P9: No, I. The the spelling error drives me nuts, but.

111
00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:00.910
Moderator: Alright. I'm gonna ask you to move on, please.

112
00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:06.969
P9: And actually it doesn't let me.

113
00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:13.939
Moderator: Okay. So what would you do if I wasn't here? If this occurred? What would you have done.

114
00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:19.929
P9: I'll probably do some basic problem solving and make sure I didn't do something stupid on the previous screen.

115
00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.990
Moderator: Okay, go ahead and please do that.

116
00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:28.706
Moderator: Just think out loud. And what you're looking for, what you intend to do.

117
00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:33.759
P9: Well, I'm almost thinking it's prompting me because I selected these that I should.

118
00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:40.880
P9: I should be seeking advice or help, or have questions on these exposures.

119
00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:42.480
Moderator: Okay.

120
00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.780
P9: But I guess I don't, at least at this time, anyway.

121
00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:50.590
Moderator: So what would you do next.

122
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:53.379
P9: Well again, it's not letting me do the next.

123
00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:56.180
P9: So it's sent me to the previous.

124
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.669
P9: So yeah, then it for. But it still forces me to say either yes or no, I definitely was exposed to stuff.

125
00:11:05.769 --> 00:11:09.600
P9: So my answer would still be, yes. But then again, it's not let me press next.

126
00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:13.210
P9: unless I press no, but.

127
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:18.839
Moderator: Go ahead and do what- what you'd normally do.

128
00:11:20.199 --> 00:11:28.190
P9: Just for the sake of navigating this to appease the the navigation of the the site. I bet I just do. No. And then next.

129
00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:30.820
Moderator: So after

130
00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:38.729
Moderator: doing, that is, what do you think of this screen screen? Is this what you expected to happen next?

131
00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:44.350
P9: Yes, based off of the list from the opening screen

132
00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:50.620
P9: about these reminders. Yeah, we're going to like, we're going through like the list of of these. Yeah. So next is tobacco. Yep.

133
00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:56.760
Moderator: So please read it, and then you can answer it.

134
00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:02.889
P9: In the past 2 months have you been living in a stable housing that you own rent, or stay in as part of a household.

135
00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:08.250
P9: and I am, yes, living in a single housing.

136
00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:11.990
Moderator: Okay, anything. Unclear on this page?

137
00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:13.670
P9: No.

138
00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:15.850
Moderator: Okay, move on, please.

139
00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:26.129
P9: And this is about food insecurity. Do you want me to read anything about this.

140
00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:28.000
Moderator: Yes, please.

141
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.570
P9: Okay within the past 12 months

142
00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:34.800
P9: you worried whether your food would run out before you got money to buy more.

143
00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:39.510
P9: And for me. This is never true.

144
00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.790
Moderator: Or has been never true.

145
00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:49.529
P9: Within the past 12 months. The food you bought just didn't last, and you didn't have money to get more.

146
00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:52.929
P9: That's never true as well.

147
00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:56.100
Moderator: Okay. Before you move on.

148
00:12:56.780 --> 00:13:03.610
Moderator: I'm gonna ask you to pretend that you just received a call from a good friend while you were

149
00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:15.370
Moderator: going through this experience, and you decided to take the call. And so what would you do next? If that was the case?

150
00:13:16.636 --> 00:13:19.710
P9: Well, since I'm finished with this particular page, I do this submit.

151
00:13:23.387 --> 00:13:25.030
P9: Then, from here.

152
00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:26.240
Moderator: And is.

153
00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:31.239
P9: I just I guess I would go back to the home and then log out.

154
00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:33.999
Moderator: Okay. Can you show me what you do? Please.

155
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:34.620
P9: Sure.

156
00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:43.159
P9: Okay, cool. So yeah, it's tracking my progress. So then I would just log out, can I do that?

157
00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:44.330
Moderator: Yes, please.

158
00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:53.370
Moderator: Okay. So now let's pretend that you're returning fact.

159
00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:56.650
Moderator: So I'm gonna ask you to actually, if

160
00:13:56.780 --> 00:14:08.229
Moderator: within the browser, if you can exit the experience and click on the link again to simulate you returning back to the screen.

161
00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:11.690
Moderator: Once you're done with your phone call.

162
00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:31.519
Moderator: So is this what you expected to see after you returned from Europe?

163
00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:33.000
Moderator: Call.

164
00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:33.890
P9: Yep.

165
00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:36.040
Moderator: Okay.

166
00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:44.479
Moderator: I'm gonna ask you to go ahead and move on and do what you would have done if I wasn't here again.

167
00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:45.420
Moderator: Okay.

168
00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:52.479
P9: Alright! This is about smoking cigarettes. Tobacco use?

169
00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.420
P9: Oh, no, just cigarettes.

170
00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:01.179
P9: I have never smoked.

171
00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:06.959
P9: Am I free to continue.

172
00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:08.669
Moderator: Yes, go ahead!

173
00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:11.260
P9: Confirmed?

174
00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:14.699
P9: These questions are easy, because I've never smoked so.

175
00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:15.770
Moderator: Okay.

176
00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:20.940
P9: Sexual orientation.

177
00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:27.620
P9: All patients are asked about the sexual intent, preventive care to meet your health goals can be recommended.

178
00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:31.139
P9: Do you think you're? I am straight.

179
00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:35.869
P9: Am I free to continue.

180
00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:36.830
Moderator: Yes.

181
00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:45.160
P9: Never forget you said, Allow thing for this. Yeah.

182
00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:46.280
Moderator: So

183
00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:54.909
Moderator: after submitting that your last question, is this what you expected to happen, or did you expect something else.

184
00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:59.590
P9: Yeah, it's basically just a little checklist that says, I've I've done these now.

185
00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.090
Moderator: Okay.

186
00:16:01.953 --> 00:16:09.740
Moderator: Let's say you were. You were going through the experience, and you had a question, or you wanted to get help.

187
00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:11.750
Moderator: What would you do.

188
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:16.039
P9: Regarding these questions, or just in just help in general.

189
00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:19.900
Moderator: Regarding this whole experience.

190
00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:25.190
P9: Oh, I've looked for the a menu of sorts.

191
00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:31.159
Moderator: Okay. Can you go ahead and do that and show me what you would do if I was in here again?

192
00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:34.450
P9: This is pretty minimal.

193
00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:39.850
P9: Oh, I'm at the homepage.

194
00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:58.999
Moderator: And if you can think out loud while you're doing this, please.

195
00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:06.940
P9: Oh, yeah, just look, I'm look just basically just looking for a menu screen of some sort to see what my options are. If I need help. There's a message center

196
00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:12.690
P9: report problem. I don't think that's pertinent to

197
00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:16.079
P9: where you're having me. Do I think? Message Center.

198
00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:20.090
Moderator: Okay, is this what you expected to see.

199
00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:23.119
P9: No actually.

200
00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:25.420
Moderator: What did you expect to see?

201
00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:28.559
P9: So I guess what is password, Hc.

202
00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:30.940
P9: Stands for.

203
00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:31.870
Moderator: I'm sorry.

204
00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:33.479
Moderator: What is it?

205
00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:37.069
P9: So the message center it says, Hc, complete your assessments.

206
00:17:37.991 --> 00:17:39.610
P9: What does H. What does hc, mean?

207
00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:42.769
Moderator: I'm assuming that that's your initials.

208
00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:43.679
P9: Oh, I got you!

209
00:17:44.288 --> 00:17:48.551
Moderator: Could, I could be mistaking. But

210
00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:52.560
Moderator: okay, so that- that confuses you right.

211
00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:56.930
P9: Yeah, cause it's on here. It's ie, okay.

212
00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:05.667
P9: yeah. So I would go to a message center of some sort.

213
00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:10.050
P9: yeah.

214
00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:20.030
P9: yeah.

215
00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:25.700
P9: Yeah. I guess the message center is the only option, I think from here that I can, that I can see.

216
00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:26.650
Moderator: Okay.

217
00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:27.870
Moderator: So if

218
00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:35.840
Moderator: okay. So if you would have, let's say you were in the middle of the experience and you

219
00:18:37.207 --> 00:18:42.380
Moderator: was looking for help and couldn't find help. What would you do next?

220
00:18:48.572 --> 00:18:55.350
P9: Well, I guess I wouldn't. I guess I wouldn't stop looking for help. But 5

221
00:18:55.970 --> 00:19:00.109
P9: met the dead end, I think on my end right now.

222
00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:01.350
Moderator: Okay.

223
00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:16.969
Moderator: that's-, that's fine. So based on the layout and formatting of all these questions on a scale of one to 5, with one very, being very easy, and 5 being very difficult. How easy

224
00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:21.280
Moderator: or difficult was it to answer any of these questions.

225
00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:23.300
P9: Oh, one.

226
00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:25.720
Moderator: One. Very easy. Okay.

227
00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:32.540
P9: Oh, actually, correction, I would say, like 2 or 3, or let's just say 2, because of that one that you're prompted to

228
00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:35.979
P9: say yes, on like that, that exposure.

229
00:19:36.847 --> 00:19:41.820
Moderator: Okay. So on the toxic exposure. One that was okay.

230
00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:43.830
Moderator: Alright.

231
00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:48.340
P9: Easy to answer, of course, but it's hard to. I mean the the navigation

232
00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:50.920
P9: prompting is what makes it a little weird.

233
00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:57.569
Moderator: Okay, can you just tell me about your overall impression of this prototype

234
00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:03.639
Moderator: in terms of using it to answer health questionnaires.

235
00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:07.560
P9: Oh, visually. It's simple and clean and uncluttered.

236
00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:08.730
Moderator: Okay.

237
00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:14.740
Moderator: And what did you think about the process of submitting your questionnaire?

238
00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:17.580
P9: Oh, that's super easy. Yeah, just next

239
00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:21.400
P9: back and submit. So it's yeah, super easy.

240
00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:26.150
Moderator: So what part of the experience worked? As you expected.

241
00:20:28.063 --> 00:20:33.559
P9: Just the again the uncluttered. It's just the simple, simple options. You can't get lost, or

242
00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:39.979
P9: really can't get confused with any of the the buttons or prompts to go next, like again, it's just next

243
00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:45.339
P9: previous or submit. So you're not gonna accidentally click some stupid button that.

244
00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:49.569
P9: you know, blows up your computer. So it's just simple.

245
00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:58.800
Moderator: Was there any instance where you got something that you didn't expect or didn't match what you were.

246
00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:05.660
P9: No, just the I guess the menu screen. I guess that we're like there's a home button, of course I see, but there's no

247
00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:15.550
P9: set of it's like a not like a clear, comprehensive list of like menu options. I guess.

248
00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:17.150
Moderator: Okay.

249
00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:23.810
Moderator: So you find the list. Now, that list is not clear enough.

250
00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:28.450
P9: I guess it is back to being minimal. But like the like, the message center, for instance.

251
00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:34.350
P9: you know, like, what message center for what like is that just

252
00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:41.699
P9: generic messages from the Va. Is that from my provider himself? Is that

253
00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:46.280
P9: automatic reminders? Is that? Am I speaking to a person if I got in the message center.

254
00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:51.009
Moderator: Okay. Is there anything else on the menu that's unclear.

255
00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:57.340
P9: No, I've never had to do the the report problem. But I'm assuming that's if there's like some

256
00:21:58.347 --> 00:22:02.459
P9: glitch. I guess I'm assuming. That's what that's for.

257
00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:05.850
Moderator: But is this you expected to happen.

258
00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:09.340
P9: No.

259
00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:11.509
Moderator: What did you expect?

260
00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:14.129
P9: Like a like a you know.

261
00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:17.209
P9: This is what I would expect on the message screen.

262
00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:19.480
Moderator: Okay.

263
00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:25.369
P9: And then maybe like, who am I like? Who? Who am I? Who am I speaking to? I guess.

264
00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:26.500
Moderator: Okay.

265
00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:29.519
P9: This doesn't say who I'm talking to at all. It's this is just.

266
00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:32.010
P9: It's me to who.

267
00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:34.960
Moderator: Okay.

268
00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:42.070
P9: And then again, the subject, the subject matter like is this regarding just the website itself? Or is this regarding my health, or or what.

269
00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:50.530
Moderator: So what would be an ideal screen or experience to happen if you clicked on the report form.

270
00:22:52.605 --> 00:22:54.090
P9: Sorry we. Can you say that question again.

271
00:22:54.090 --> 00:23:02.449
Moderator: What would be your ideal experience, or the next screen to pop up

272
00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:09.660
Moderator: after you hit on the report form menu wire.

273
00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:14.939
Moderator: If you can go back there. The report problem. Yeah.

274
00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:19.870
P9: Maybe like a list of

275
00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:37.969
P9: almost like a list of contacts like like to specify what this is for. Again, I guess this for the websites. Operation itself is, there's some weird graphical itch or issue. Or, you know, whatever computer stuff that can go wrong is going wrong. Or is this for me and my provider.

276
00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:40.690
Moderator: Okay, great.

277
00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:42.520
Moderator: You can.

278
00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:44.710
Moderator: You can exit that.

279
00:23:45.759 --> 00:23:59.660
Moderator: So how would you? How do you feel about using this tool? To answer questions about your personal health information. Do you feel that it's safe and secure.

280
00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:07.400
P9: I guess I wouldn't know

281
00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:12.809
Moderator: You say no, can you?

282
00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:15.340
P9: Yeah, some some websites in the past have.

283
00:24:15.610 --> 00:24:21.049
P9: We'll kind of specify like, Oh, this this is who you're talking to. This is how it's

284
00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:25.969
P9: protected, or whatever, and

285
00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:33.480
P9: I guess I I don't. I'm like I guess I'm indifferent. I wouldn't. I have no reason not to trust it, but I don't have

286
00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:39.040
P9: maybe some of the visual reminders that say I should.

287
00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:45.990
Moderator: Okay, so would you have gone ahead with experience the way it is. Now, if you were

288
00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.889
Moderator: doing this on your own.

289
00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:54.189
P9: Yes, I yeah, like again. Generally, I'm I'm kind of a different like I'm I generally trust

290
00:24:54.370 --> 00:24:57.649
P9: if it's coming from the Va. It's coming from the Government. I generally trust it.

291
00:24:57.790 --> 00:25:07.639
Moderator: Okay, what about the length of time that it took you to complete the experience? Did you find it reasonable or unreasonable?

292
00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:09.800
P9: Reasonable. It's pretty easy.

293
00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:10.630
P9: Yeah.

294
00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:19.350
Moderator: And have you used any digit? Have you responded to any digital surveys or questionnaires in the past?

295
00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:25.250
P9: Yeah, I think I asked that question initially, saying, no. But now that yes, I have several times. Yeah, they usually did.

296
00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:33.890
Moderator: So do you recall if you were to compare this experience with those? Do you have an opinion.

297
00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:37.540
P9: No.

298
00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:45.030
P9: for the most part it's the same. It it's like the very general questions that can. Again, they're screening. They're making sure.

299
00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:47.190
P9: Yeah, no.

300
00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:52.860
P9: they're using the same set of questions for the most part, although I do believe that toxic exposure.

301
00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:57.100
P9: I don't recall being asked questions about toxic exposure in the past.

302
00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:00.620
Moderator: Okay, so that those are new to you.

303
00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:07.580
P9: Yes, I know, like I think the Burn Pit stuff Burn Pit registry is relatively new. So some of these questions might be newer.

304
00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:11.820
P9: but I can't recall being asked about toxic exposures in particular.

305
00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:21.720
Moderator: So, [redacted PII], if you could just change one thing about this whole entire experience, what would it be.

306
00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:30.970
P9: Definitely, I guess. The the definitely the menu screen make it easier to find.

307
00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:35.700
P9: I know there's the home, and then menu can be confusing.

308
00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:39.459
P9: like a menu screen that actually specifies.

309
00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:43.610
P9: If you want to contact somebody who who is it?

310
00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:47.330
P9: Yeah.

311
00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:51.669
Moderator: Okay. And and you feel like the profile icon.

312
00:26:54.540 --> 00:27:06.340
P9: I have no problem using that. I can see some some old parts having issues with that, or maybe not grasping that right off the bat, but to me I I get that right off the bat. Then I I see now that's supposed to be my initials. So that would be not a problem.

313
00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:08.150

315
00:27:35.443 --> 00:27:40.790
Moderator: very satisfied, and with 5 being dissatisfied.

316
00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:48.750
P9: I would say 2 just again based off that experience with the toxic exposure, screening questionnaire.

317
00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:52.710
Moderator: So. A. 2, 5.

318
00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:53.699
P9: Still to agree to that. Yeah.

319
00:27:54.310 --> 00:28:01.610
Moderator: Okay, [redacted PII], that's all that I have for you today. Before I close. Do you have any questions for me?

320
00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:02.710
P9: No.

321
00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:09.490
Moderator: Okay, I'm just gonna ask our my colleagues, [Observer], do you have any questions for [redacted PII]?

322
00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:12.930
Observer: I have no questions. Just thanks a lot for taking the time to do this.

323

Moderator: Okay, [redacted PII], so thank you again for helping us with, give us feedback on this prototype. I just wanted to reiterate that everything that we did today will not affect your healthcare in any way. This was just a prototype.

327
00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:53.780
Moderator: and lastly, Purgene will be sending you like a Thank you. Note with a little blurb, saying that you can pass it along to other veterans, that you may know that may want to be participants in an usability test in the future.

328
00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:57.970
Moderator: But other than that, thank you again, and enjoy the rest of your day.
