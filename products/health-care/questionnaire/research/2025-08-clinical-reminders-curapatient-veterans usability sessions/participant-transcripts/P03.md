P3: Yes, I am.

3
00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:28.060
Moderator: Great. Thank you for that. So I'm just going to start off. Have you ever responded to health questionnaires that you've received either from your Va. Physician, either at your appointment or through email or text. Do you recall anything like that?

4
00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:41.866
P3: This year. In fact, I got a a surprise questionnaire when I showed up from my annual visit Va. Checkup in [redacted PII], at the the outpatient clinic there. And it was on

5
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.629
P3: vision vision, a vision questionnaire.

6
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.609
Moderator: So do you remember whether, if it was paper based, or whether it was digital.

7
00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.590
P3: Just pay for basic. Give me a clipboard and a PIN.

8
00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.199
Moderator: Okay, did you experience any difficulties with completing that questionnaire?

9
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.600
P3: No, none.

10
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.110
P3: It actually led it. Actually, after I finished the questionnaire

11
00:01:07.668 --> 00:01:14.279
P3: they actually had me do a eye examination which I've never had done before through the Va.

12
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.599
Moderator: Great. So that do you feel that questionnaire helped you.

13
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:26.129
P3: Yeah, I think so. It was. I mean immediately afterwards I was. That was a surprise, too, because I never had that done before.

14
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.240
Moderator: That's that's great to hear. Thank you for that feedback, [redacted PII].

15
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:58.559
Moderator: So next we're going to pretend that you have a doctor's appointment in 2 days, and your doctor had emailed you some health questionnaires for you to complete before your upcoming appointment with him or her. These questionnaires may or may not be related to your upcoming appointment, so they may not have anything to do with your upcoming appointment. The Va. Would like to know general health

16
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:15.360
Moderator: questions, so, as I said, some of these may be familiar to you, and you may have answered them before while some of these questions you've never seen before, so I'm going to send you a link through the

17
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.820
Moderator: through the chat, and I'll ask you

18
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:29.430
Moderator: to answer the questions. But before we do that, what device are you using today.

19
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:30.989
P3: On our laptop.

20
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.650
Moderator: Laptop. Okay, so do you see where your zoom chat is?

21
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.190
P3: Say that again. Do I see where I'm doing the the chat feature on the screen? Yes.

22
00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.879
Moderator: It's on the bottom. So how about the shares feature? Do you see that.

23
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.189
P3: Yes, and it's highlighted in green right now.

24
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.399
Moderator: Excellent. So I'm gonna ask you to share your screen.

25
00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.130
P3: Okay.

26
00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.579
Moderator: And then I'm gonna ask you to go back.

27
00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:15.799
Moderator: do you see a toolbar there? And it's it's probably highlighted green, and it could be anywhere in your screen. It could be floated in the middle.

28
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.050
P3: I see where it says entire screen

29
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:30.640
P3: I see on the that's on the right hand, left hand side in a larger block, and then on the right hand side, from a diagonal, it says, layouts.

30
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.820
P3: It gives me a chance option that looks like enlarge it

31
00:03:34.885 --> 00:03:48.349
P3: and then it shows 4 different screens, a full screen, a pick up screen, what looks like a human figure, and then a human figure with a rectangle. And with this rectangle in the upper right hand corner.

32
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.070
P3: and then a human screaming rectangle in the middle. And then it says, options share, sound.

33
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.359
P3: optimize for video clip, and that's it, and then down at the bottom. It says, Share.

34
00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:03.819
Moderator: Okay, so- so let's try the 1st screen, do you? How many screens do you have available.

35
00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:05.979
P3: The 4th screen.

36
00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.259
Moderator: Okay, let's try the 1st screen.

37
00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.300
P3: That's just the one that it's already highlighted. It's the one that's the full screen.

38
00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.850
P3: This is this is the second screen.

39
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:25.599
Moderator: Okay, so the full screen is already highlighted. Okay? So what I'm gonna do. So what I did is I I

40
00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:40.519
Moderator: I pasted a link in the chat, and I sent it to you. So if you can find the chat, and then once you find the chat click on the link. But don't do anything until I tell you to.

41
00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:47.929
P3: Okay. So the the screen that showed the the this, the chats items at the bottom is no longer there.

42
00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:50.270
Moderator: Okay.

43
00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:55.880
P3: What I said I I can probably find my way back to it. If you give me a second here.

44
00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:07.220
Moderator: So it would be on the the toolbar, and as I mentioned the toolbars probably floating in the middle of your screen, or it could be at the bottom of your screen.

45
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:08.040
P3: Not.

46
00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:15.429
Moderator: It's not. Do you see? Let me see if I can share something with you.

47
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.750
Moderator: Yeah, you can't see that.

48
00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:38.290
P3: I'm just going through the screen options that it gives me to see if it changes anything

49
00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.068
P3: and it and it doesn't. It shows

50
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.460
Moderator: Entire screen.

51
00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.830

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.699
P3: Screen share.

54
00:05:46.860 --> 00:06:02.869
Moderator: Yes, excellent. So- so if you can find the the toolbar that's floating it, it might be up. Yes, right there. And then you wanna hit chat. There's gonna be like.

55
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.159
P3: Let me do this again. Sorry!

56
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.749
Moderator: Oh, no no worries.

57
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.680
P3: App.

58
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.509

59
00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.370
Moderator: Yes, so there's a link in there, and please click on the link.

60
00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:37.350
Moderator: Okay, and don't do anything until I ask you to. And I'm saying to.

61
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:44.499
Moderator: There's these 2 grayed out boxes, and I can you move those out of the way, if that's possible.

62
00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:45.540
P3: No.

63
00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:55.790
Moderator: Yeah. So the- the 1st one is on the upper. Yeah, that one can. Is that possible to move out of the way? I don't. I don't know what that is.

64
00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:00.619
Moderator: Can you, X. Out of it or minimize it?

65
00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:11.360
P3: It says you were screen sharing, and it shows the screen and and the the task bar with the different things like chat and share, or below or above it. So is that, does that help.

66
00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:20.069
Moderator: Yeah. So what you need to do? Can you take that and put that down to the bottom of the screen as far as far as it can go.

67
00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:24.270
Moderator: Yeah, even. Yeah.

68
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:41.220
Moderator: yeah, perfect. And now the one, there's also a tool that must be the chat is that the chat function over on the right hand side there's like a a rectangle, another gray rectangle on my right hand side, right there.

69
00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:47.120
P3: On the right hand side. It shows me and you and your name and Shawn.

70
00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:53.890
P3: and then on the left hand, on the left part of the screen, it says, Hello, patient. Your clinical reminders.

71
00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:57.970
Moderator: Okay, is there any way that you can minimize that.

72
00:07:59.420 --> 00:07:59.970
P3: The.

73
00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:01.419
Moderator: That correct.

74
00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:03.309
P3: That you're on the screen that you're on.

75
00:08:04.822 --> 00:08:12.070
Moderator: No. Minimize the screen with our pictures. Oh, let's see.

76
00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:14.380
P3: Let me go back. Let me go back to it again. Hold on

77
00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:23.909
P3: real strong security software. And it's reminding me that it's an unknown link. So it takes a moment.

78
00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:29.069
Moderator: No worries. Yeah, that must be it. Cause I've never seen this occur before.

79
00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:32.720
Moderator: So either minimize that, or really.

80
00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:46.920
Moderator: if you can place it up on the top. So we we wanna ensure that nothing is obstructing the user interface of of the screen that we're on right now. And right now this box is obstructing it.

81
00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:51.440
P3: I I can move it. Let me see. There! How's that?

82
00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:58.749
Moderator: Yeah, it's still on. Oh, that's better. Can you move that? Let's see. Can you push that all the way down

83
00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:01.389
Moderator: to the bottom as far as you can.

84
00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:02.740

Moderator: So

89
00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:36.206
Moderator: I just wanna let you know that the link that I put in the chat is a 1 time link that is made only for you. And we can imagine that was sent to you over email or text. This. And so there's no logging needed because it was sent specifically to you.

90
00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:42.900
Moderator: So, after clicking the link, what are your impressions of the screen.

91
00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:48.529
P3: It's laid out clearly. It shows me the clinical reminders, and it lists them.

92
00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:55.910
P3: I don't. I don't know if it gives any priority. It didn't tell me which one I should fill out. First, st it just lists 3 different topics.

93
00:09:56.290 --> 00:10:02.210

P3: Going to be the end of the survey, as far as I'm concerned.

148
00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:44.840
Moderator: Can- can you elaborate more on that? Can you give me more information about that?

149
00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:49.229
P3: I see where I didn't click on an item.

150
00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:53.389
P3: So when I clicked on next and nothing happened, I started searching the screen.

151
00:13:53.540 --> 00:14:02.720
P3: and at the top of it, says veteran caregivers made aware of educational resources that include information on presumptive conditions, and it says, Confirm, and I click

152
00:14:03.408 --> 00:14:08.500
P3: the check mark, and then the next button was active, so I clicked on it.

153
00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:11.872
Moderator: So what did you think of the last screen?

154
00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:18.319
Moderator: What did you think of the prompt after you clicked on it? And you weren't going anywhere.

155
00:14:19.734 --> 00:14:29.270
P3: Well again, with my background. I I searched the screen while we were talking, and I found the other. I found the other one, but I don't know that that would be something that would be

156
00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:31.710
P3: obvious to everyone.

157
00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:42.299
Moderator: Okay? So that notice that you received Is-, is that where what you expected? Or did you expect something else?

158
00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:51.110
P3: I would have expected that to be at the bottom of the survey at the end, where I click, you know, click! Before I click. Next there should be a statement saying.

159
00:14:51.682 --> 00:14:56.110
P3: you. You were given the option to to get additional information.

160
00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:57.000
Moderator: And

161
00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:03.540
P3: If and then confirm that at that point I would have click, confirm, and then click next. But

162
00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:06.900
P3: so I went straight to the question

163
00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:11.690
P3: didn't see the item at the top of the screen, I would suggest they put it at the bottom of the screen.

164
00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:22.000
Moderator: Okay, okay, did you have any other than that? Notice that error message? Do you have anything?

165
00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:23.860
Moderator: It was simple. It was.

166
00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:34.390
P3: It was simple. It was just not me. I was focusing on the question, and not on looking to see if there was anything else I should answer. So what that's gonna prompt me to do. If there's any additional

167
00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:41.149
P3: survey questions, I would look the whole thing. I would go to the top of the screen to see if there's anything else like that before I move on.

168
00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:51.979
Moderator: Okay. So on a scale of one to 5, 1 being very easy and 5 being very difficult. How easy or difficult was it to answer these questions.

169
00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:52.670
P3: One.

170
00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.780
Moderator: I'm gonna ask you to move on. Please.

171
00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:00.930
P3: Say that again. Please.

172
00:16:01.434 --> 00:16:04.110
Moderator: Sorry I'm gonna ask you to move on.

173
00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:09.129
P3: Oh, okay, I should. It says Submit. I submitted it, you know.

174
00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:10.620
P3: Now I'm on the next survey.

175
00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:12.140
Moderator: Okay.

176
00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:26.919
P3: So it says, in the past 2 months have you been living in a stable housing, housing, that your own rent, or stay as part of the household, and while I'm doing that I'm moving the screen up and down now to see if there's anything else that I'm missing, and so far I'm not so. I'm just going to answer the question.

177
00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:33.517
Moderator: Okay. But before you do anything else, I'm gonna ask you, what do you think of this screen?

178
00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:37.049
P3: Very easy, very simple, very straightforward.

179
00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:40.210
Moderator: I'll ask you to move on. Please.

180
00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:47.990
P3: Okay, the next one's on food insecurity. It gives. It provides 2 statements that people may make about their food

181
00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:54.839
P3: for each statement indicate whether the statement often has been often true, sometimes true or never true, for the last 12 months.

182
00:16:55.080 --> 00:17:02.769
P3: and then it asked the question, when, when the within the past 12 months. You worried whether your food run out before you got money to buy?

183
00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:07.899
P3: And I would answer the question, it is never true. So should I click that now.

184
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:12.659
Moderator: So you can answer that. But don't do anything else.

185
00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:14.449
P3: Okay. I answered it.

186
00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:19.200
Moderator: Okay, is everything. What you expected here.

187
00:17:19.579 --> 00:17:26.099
P3: Yes, and again I I was searching the screen to see if maybe there was something I missed at the top, and there isn't this time.

188
00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:27.520
Moderator: Okay.

189
00:17:27.869 --> 00:17:42.109
Moderator: Okay. Now, before you move on, imagine that you received a a friend, a call from a friend, and while you're in the middle of filling out this questionnaire, and you decided to stay on the call.

190
00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:50.770
Moderator: And you plan to return to the questionnaire to finish it later. What would you do next.

191
00:17:52.807 --> 00:17:59.350
P3: I would. If to return to the original questionnaire to start, I would go to previous screen click on the previous button.

192
00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:07.250
P3: the radio button, or I would look, and then I would go through to look for the question that I hadn't answered yet.

193
00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:17.070
Moderator: Okay, can you show me? Let's say you're on the phone. Call with your friend and you and you don't have time to finish it right now, what would you do next.

194
00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:23.670
P3: Oh, I see what you're saying. No, I would. I would leave the screen on. I would leave it running.

195
00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:32.420
Moderator: Alright. Now let's say you left it on, and and it timed out, and it's blank. What would you do next?

196
00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:36.403
P3: And I would go back to where the survey began, and I was

197
00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:45.830
P3: start all over again, and I'm assuming that it would prompt me to go to the first, st to the last screen that I did not complete answering.

198
00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:52.939
Moderator: Okay, so let's pretend that that it it it timed out. And

199
00:18:53.970 --> 00:19:00.010
Moderator: we're gonna go back to start all over again. So I'm gonna ask you to X out of this.

200
00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:04.340
Moderator: Not that one, not that one. Oh.

201
00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:06.730
P3: I already X out of it. So let me go.

202
00:19:07.049 --> 00:19:14.320
Moderator: So I'm gonna ask you to head back to the chat. Are you able to get back to the chat and click on the link again?

203
00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:15.570
P3: I do?

204
00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:19.850
Moderator: Perfect. And I'm saying that those screens again.

205
00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:27.679
P3: And then and then I would go to. I would I would go to the one that I was working on, which was homeless, and food, security, insecurity.

206
00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:32.430
Moderator: So this screen here is this what? What you would expect to happen.

207
00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:38.510
P3: Yes, actually, I actually what I what I did was

208
00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:47.329
P3: I clicked on the home and homelessness and homelessness and food, insecurity, clinical reminder on the 1st screen that popped up.

209
00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:49.329
P3: I would expect it to go

210
00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:53.500
P3: to that survey portion, and it did not.

211
00:19:54.060 --> 00:20:00.719
Moderator: Okay. So when you say Ex expected to go to that survey portion, can you elaborate on that.

212
00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:18.229
P3: There were 3, the 3, the 3 surveys, or the 3 reminders, were out there, the one on housing and homelessness. Excuse me, homelessness and food. Insecurity was the middle of the 3 that were listed. It was like a list. So I went to the list and clicked on it

213
00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:24.239
P3: that one item homelessness, and it didn't do anything.

214
00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:31.489
P3: So then I click, start reminder or clinical reminders, and then it threw me to the homelessness one.

215
00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:46.700
Moderator: Okay before you move on. And and so you had mentioned you expected to receive that. So what? So what would you do if I wasn't here, and you got the screen.

216
00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:54.539
P3: I would do what I just did. I would I would. 1st thing I would do is attempt to click on the one that where I last left off.

217
00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:55.800
Moderator: Okay.

218
00:20:55.800 --> 00:21:05.709
P3: If that didn't work, then I would look for another option. In this case I would say, click on the start clinical reminders, and then go through until I found the one that I had not answered.

219
00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:15.620
Moderator: Okay. Let's say for a moment. If you needed help with this questionnaire, where would you look on here?

220
00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:35.330
P3: I would look to see if there's a help help button or help help, you know, like an information button or something, and if there's not, then I would just make an attempt to go through and answer open the the requests so I could answer it by clicking on various screens until I got to it.

221
00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:42.040
Moderator: Okay, let's let's find. Let's see if you can find something that can help you.

222
00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:47.970
P3: Okay, I'm looking.

223
00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:51.470
P3: Let me go back.

224
00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:06.490
P3: I don't see where there's anything that allows me to do that

225
00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:11.310
P3: on that, on the on the screen.

226
00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:17.079
Moderator: Right. So at this point please continue and do what you'd like to

227
00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:20.699
Moderator: what you would have done if if I wasn't here.

228
00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:27.899
P3: I would just continue to answer all the questions. And right now I'm the one about the food insecurity.

229
00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:34.149
P3: So within the last 12 months never true. See? I answer that one. Then I would go

230
00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:41.949
P3: 12 past 12 months. Food you bought just didn't last. So you didn't have money. That's never true. I would click on that, and I would just keep going.

231
00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:45.418
Moderator: Okay. So before you move on,

232
00:22:46.745 --> 00:22:53.400
Moderator: where would you expect to find a feature that would give you more information or help.

233
00:22:54.250 --> 00:23:04.320
P3: The only one that I can see that might possibly do. That is, there's a at the upper left corner of the screen. There's picture of a house, and it says Home, I probably would click on that.

234
00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:09.129
P3: But what I would be worried about is that if I go there am I gonna have to start all over again.

235
00:23:09.714 --> 00:23:15.400
Moderator: Okay, can. Can you please do that? Would so would you click on that, or you wouldn't.

236
00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:19.230
P3: I I clicked on it, and it threw me back to the screen that had the

237
00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:22.430
P3: 3 topics on the clinical reminders.

238
00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:24.979
Moderator: And I don't see.

239
00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:29.149
P3: I don't see any kind of help screen there, either.

240
00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:38.329
P3: It just says Hello, patient! And the clinical reminders to start clinical reminders. Bar recommended education.

241
00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:40.289
P3: and that's it.

242
00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:45.680
Moderator: Okay, where would you put the help or more information.

243
00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:47.900
P3: What would I do?

244
00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:50.249
Moderator: But where would you like to see it?

245
00:23:52.040 --> 00:24:04.679
P3: Actually it should. It should be something that floats on the screen at every level. If you're gonna if you want people to be able to quickly find the next step, or what it is that they can do to resolve a problem. They might be happening.

246
00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:08.540
P3: I would have them put a floating help button.

247
00:24:09.225 --> 00:24:09.690
Moderator: Okay.

248
00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:12.250
P3: That that pops up on each screen

249
00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:16.379
P3: somewhere in the in the visual range of the

250
00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:20.850
P3: the topic, so that people could say, Oh, there's the help button right there. It's floating with me.

251
00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:22.350
Moderator: Okay.

252
00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:24.850
Moderator: So I'm going to ask you to proceed.

253
00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:32.180
P3: Okay. So I'm gonna do. I'm gonna go to the survey. Let me see, it's going. It's the last one says sexual orientation

254
00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:37.579
P3: clinical reminder, and I'm looking at the top. Go ahead.

255
00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:40.429
Moderator: Is this what you expected, [redacted PII]?

256
00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:45.780
P3: Yeah, cause it's it's it's it's not letting me go back to the the ones I've already completed.

257
00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:53.328
P3: So I I that's what I expect I mean

258
00:24:54.214 --> 00:25:00.250
P3: I don't think it wants me to go back and try and change the topics, or to change the responses already provided.

259
00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:02.050
Moderator: Okay.

260
00:25:02.989 --> 00:25:10.180
Moderator: besides, the home screen. Is there any way that you would consider navigating back to the previous screen?

261
00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:16.170
P3: On on this, on this the one, the last

262
00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:21.150
P3: reminder. It doesn't give you a previous button previous screen button.

263
00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:22.520
Moderator: Okay.

264
00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:28.400
P3: So if you if that's if that I don't know why I would want to do that if I already answered the questions.

265
00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:38.560
P3: The only way I could do that is, if there was either. I guess I could go back to the home screen. But I don't think it's gonna allow me, at least let me try it. Can I try it?

266
00:25:39.030 --> 00:25:40.012
Moderator: Yes, go ahead!

267
00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:43.029
P3: So I met back in the home screen.

268
00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:45.000
P3: And

269
00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:53.299
P3: yeah, it does. I went back and clicked on the the last topic about the stable housing, and it let me go to it.

270
00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:58.989
P3: So I'm gonna go back to the home screen again, and then, so that I didn't know that was gonna happen.

271
00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:06.990
P3: But if I now I know that if I want to change something in a previous response that I can go to the home screen and do that.

272
00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:12.220
Moderator: What would you expect to happen? You said you didn't know that that would happen. What did you expect.

273
00:26:13.803 --> 00:26:18.110
P3: What I thought was that it's not gonna let me go back. But obviously it does

274
00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:19.195
P3: so

275
00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:26.839
P3: The instructions never specified that that I could go back and change my answers.

276
00:26:27.050 --> 00:26:31.359
P3: or it didn't tell me if I could go back and change my answers, how to do it.

277
00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:36.430
P3: so it would just be a discovery kind of thing where I would have to go through and figure it out myself.

278
00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:40.210
Moderator: Okay, all right, you can continue. Please.

279
00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:47.260
P3: Okay? And then are answering about the sexual orientation.

280
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:53.120
Moderator: And before you click, submit anything on here that's unexpected or unclear.

281
00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:55.739
P3: Nothing, nothing. It's real, simple.

282
00:26:56.040 --> 00:27:04.989
Moderator: Okay, on a scale of one to 5, 1 being very easy and 5 being very difficult. How easy or difficult was it to answer.

283
00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:07.370
P3: Very easy, 1 1.

284
00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:08.210
Moderator: Okay.

285
00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:16.969
P3: I'm trying to put put this in the focus of if

286
00:27:17.657 --> 00:27:27.369
P3: you know, like kiss principle, or where some people call it, where I'm trying to figure out is everybody gonna think the same way I do, because I have a different background than most people.

287
00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:33.439
P3: So I think there's not a lot of prompting

288
00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:40.510
P3: screens available or help screens available to the user when they're going through these 3 reminders.

289
00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:45.200
Moderator: Okay. So- so in in particular, what would you like to see

290
00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:52.010
Moderator: for help screens? You mentioned a flowing, floating button. But was there anything else.

291
00:27:52.010 --> 00:28:07.660
P3: Well, I'd like to see probably 2 things. One is the floating help button, something that floats along with each each survey or each reminder that that just appears on the screen. That person could click on you know. Click on this, if you need help.

292
00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:18.379
P3: and or and or a chat feature where I could chat with somebody, either either AI or related or actual human.

293
00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:20.170
Moderator: To ask a question.

294
00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:28.020
Moderator: All right, [redacted PII], I'm just gonna try one more thing. I'm gonna ask you to go and click on the toxic exposure

295
00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:29.960
Moderator: clinical reminder.

296
00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:31.090
P3: Okay.

297
00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:41.030
Moderator: And how would you move forward? Let's say you're reviewing your answers. What would you do to move forward from this screen.

298
00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:44.940
P3: Click. The next button.

299
00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:46.690
P3: Is that what you're asking me?

300
00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:52.180
P3: I mean, that would be it. That would I mean that that's the only option.

301
00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:53.819
Moderator: Okay, let's try that.

302
00:28:58.788 --> 00:29:02.510
P3: Says, thank you for telling us about your toxic exposure concerns

303
00:29:02.770 --> 00:29:13.909
P3: help us connect you, connect you with the information about current services you may need to tell us which talks you think you're exposed to. And I did click on it, and I don't know why I showed that screen.

304
00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:18.929
Moderator: Okay, so this, so, okay, so this surprised you.

305
00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:28.269
P3: Yeah, I I don't know that. I mean again that that doesn't seem to me to be necessary, because I've already answered the question.

306
00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:36.630
Moderator: Okay, so let's say you wanted to look at the last screen.

307
00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:39.229
Moderator: What would you do next?

308
00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:43.240
Moderator: The the screen before this one? I'm sorry.

309
00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:47.390
P3: There's a previous button at the bottom left of the screen. You want me to click on it.

310
00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:52.119
Moderator: Before you do that. What do you think of that previous button?

311
00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:57.819
P3: It works fine. That's what I was saying on the other ones that the other. When you finish the survey doesn't have

312
00:29:58.316 --> 00:30:06.629
P3: for each reminder at the bottom. It doesn't have my recolation, was it? Did not have a previous button, so I could go back.

313
00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:22.770
Moderator: All right. And what did you think of the placement and just overall the where, how it was formatted the previous button? What did you think of it relative to the whole ui.

314
00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:25.610
P3: I think it's fine. I mean, I

315
00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:35.820
P3: I'm not sure. I mean, I'm assuming this is a test. I don't know if if they're if they're gonna do this, and they want it to be obvious. If you have a

316
00:30:36.575 --> 00:30:40.510
P3: if you want a help button, I would make it to where the button is red.

317
00:30:40.910 --> 00:30:42.530
P3: If you want to do the

318
00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:47.589
P3: next button that should probably be green, and the previous button should probably be like yellow or

319
00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:49.729
P3: or gray, or something.

320
00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:54.419
P3: So again, green indicate you're done yellow or

321
00:30:54.970 --> 00:30:58.230
P3: other gray colors, showing that there's another option.

322
00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:07.480
Moderator: Okay, so what would you do next? Let's say that you want would like to submit the questionnaire.

323
00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:09.950
Moderator: What would you do next?

324
00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:15.639
P3: Okay. Well, again, there was. I had to go through and answer all the questions.

325
00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:19.339
P3: Let me do that. Let me click. Next again.

326
00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:24.799
P3: It says, Thank you for completing the screener. We'll send you a text. And I clicked. Okay.

327
00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:26.420
P3: and that would be the end of it.

328
00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:33.369
Moderator: Okay. What was your impression of submitting this questionnaire? Was this.

329
00:31:33.370 --> 00:31:33.730
P3: So.

330
00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:34.630
Moderator: Yep.

331
00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:36.170
P3: It's simple, it's simple.

332
00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:39.578
P3: So I think you know.

333
00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:48.909
P3: you might. It says, Thank you for completing the screener. So that tells you. You've done it. And then but the okay, I would. I would probably put

334
00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:53.819
P3: click the okay button. When you're ready to close, complete, close this screen.

335
00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:56.590
P3: Still, just okay.

336
00:31:58.710 --> 00:31:59.320
Moderator: So.

337
00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:03.940
P3: If the next step is, if you click on that button and

338
00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:08.629
P3: then it goes. The screen goes away after a second or 2

339
00:32:08.850 --> 00:32:15.760
P3: then that's what I would expect. But right now I clicked. Either I had clicked previously on that button, and nothing happened.

340
00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.369
Moderator: So what would you do next then?

341
00:32:18.810 --> 00:32:23.249
P3: I I would just probably end the survey at this point, because there's nothing else for me to do.

342
00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:26.180
Moderator: Okay. How would you do that.

343
00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:30.349
P3: We're closing the screen, just actually it out.

344
00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:31.770
Moderator: Okay.

345
00:32:32.473 --> 00:32:39.339
Moderator: So was there anything that stood out to you that you weren't sure about this whole experience?

346
00:32:40.290 --> 00:32:45.400
P3: No, it's really relatively simple. Again, there was just a little minor thing

347
00:32:45.670 --> 00:32:52.980
P3: it seems like seems to be well thought out. Just little minor things that I would add to make it more friendly for people who are maybe not as.

348
00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:54.910
Moderator: Computer literate.

349
00:32:55.270 --> 00:33:01.149
P3: Who are not used to doing this type of thing. There are people I understand, that still don't know how to use computers correctly.

350
00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:03.810
P3: or smartphones, or anything like that.

351
00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:10.869
P3: So you might want to make it to where it's I wouldn't say foolproof, but a little bit easier

352
00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:15.780
P3: for people to, you know, be prompted if they need help.

353
00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:22.789
Moderator: Other than the things that you've already mentioned. Is there anything else that you would add to make it more

354
00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:24.190
Moderator: use at all?

355
00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:37.679
P3: The the closing screen. If if you want them to to definitely know that when they click a certain button this, the survey will end, the screen will close. Then they should have a button that does that, a radio button that says that.

356
00:33:38.530 --> 00:33:44.529
Moderator: Okay, what do you think about the length of time to complete this whole experience.

357
00:33:46.455 --> 00:33:47.150
P3: Am.

358
00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:53.540
P3: It's I mean the whole thing. If if you hadn't prompted me, the whole thing probably would have taken me 2 or 3 min.

359
00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:57.350
Moderator: Okay. And what do you think about that?

360
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:58.530
P3: I think that's fine.

361
00:33:59.240 --> 00:33:59.700
Moderator: Okay.

362
00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:03.769
P3: It again, you know, because those are topics that I'm already.

363
00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:12.029
P3: I've you know, researched and familiar with. I was an adjutant general officer in the army, and I was an automation and personnel officer. So I understand.

364
00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:14.749
P3: For 30 years I did this.

365
00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:22.730
P3: Not everybody has, so it would probably might be difficult for some people so other than that.

366
00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:24.659
P3: I think it's fine.

367
00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:37.440
Moderator: So how do you feel about using this tool to provide information about your personal health information? Do you feel that it's safe and secure.

368
00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:47.780
P3: I don't know that you can say that by looking at the screens I think that there an attestation should be made

369
00:34:47.929 --> 00:34:51.830
P3: at the front of it. If that's something that you think people might worry about

370
00:34:52.080 --> 00:35:01.100
P3: that, they're getting ready to answer a survey. The information is going to be captured and then maybe discuss briefly the level of security associated with it.

371
00:35:01.530 --> 00:35:03.479
P3: so that people will get worried.

372
00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:09.280
P3: And if they do have any concerns, or they don't want to decline answering that they get that option.

373
00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:17.249
Moderator: Okay. So if I wasn't here, would you feel safe and and secure? Answering these questions.

374
00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:28.619
P3: If I if I received an email from the Va. And I confirmed it, was actually from the Va. And it had these links, I probably wouldn't have a problem with it, especially the topics.

375
00:35:28.770 --> 00:35:32.319
P3: the the general information in the topics.

376
00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:35.879
P3: and the responses that I provided. There wasn't any

377
00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:40.440
P3: kind of identify personal, identifying information that I can see

378
00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:44.639
P3: that would make me stand out by just answering those questions.

379
00:35:44.980 --> 00:36:05.830
Moderator: Okay? So from your experience. How does this prototype tool compare to other questionnaires in it that you may have interacted with digitally. Have you used any for? Just not necessarily from the Va. But others that you've used.

380
00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:15.260
P3: Think again, with the exception of maybe have having more screen, visible screen prompt.

381
00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:19.989
P3: If you want people to take certain actions like, if they need help click on a red button

382
00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:26.280
P3: or blue button, or whatever it is you wanted to do. And then maybe, if they want to go back and change their answers.

383
00:36:27.568 --> 00:36:35.920
P3: For some reason they just made it change their mind, or something that they give be given an option to pick the screen that they want to change.

384
00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:38.630
P3: instead of having to go through the whole survey.

385
00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:48.820
Moderator: All right, [redacted PII], if you can. Only you mentioned a few things to make this experience better. But if you can only change one thing

386
00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:52.819
Moderator: about this whole experience. What would it be.

387
00:36:53.130 --> 00:36:54.370
P3: Add the help, button.

388
00:36:54.700 --> 00:37:13.219
Moderator: Okay, and finally, if you had to interact with this prototype on a regular cadence, let's say the Va. Will would send you questionnaires every 3 months or so. How would you feel about interacting with this prototype? Would you be

389
00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:21.771
Moderator: Very satisfied, dissatisfied, neither dissatisfied nor satisfied, satisfied or very satisfied.

390
00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:25.460
P3: I would say, very satisfied I think it would be.

391
00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:34.509
P3: I would I would draw back to my previous experience from this survey, and and say, Well, this is only takes 2 or 3 min. This is no big deal. I'll do it right now.

392
00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:42.799
Moderator: Okay, that's great to hear. Thank you for that before we close. Do you have any questions for me, [redacted PII]?

393
00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:47.569
P3: No, I'm just. I'm curious. Is this something they're actually gonna plan on doing.

394
00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:55.149
Moderator: Yes, we are that. Yes, that's why we're getting your feedback. We are looking to incorporate this.

395
00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:56.425
P3: Okay,

396
00:37:56.860 --> 00:38:02.693
Moderator: Not necessarily this tool. But we are looking to incorporate a digital

397
00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:09.270
Moderator: a tool that we can email or text you. So you can answer questions.

398
00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:13.949
P3: Yeah, again. I mean, there might. You might want to provide

399
00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:24.320
P3: thinking about it. Because again, having to me, I having to train people how to use computers and different systems. I would suggest, maybe have like a small tutorial.

400
00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:34.640
P3: or they can. If you you know, if you know, if you're worried about how this this test is, our survey is done. Please go through this tutorial, and it will give you

401
00:38:34.770 --> 00:38:38.369
P3: details on what what it will look like just like you're doing with me.

402
00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:42.611
Moderator: Okay? And how like in? How would you

403
00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:50.319
Moderator: give access to the tutorial? But like, where would you like the tutorial to be.

404
00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:51.640
P3: On the 1st screen.

405
00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:58.660
Moderator: Okay? So the tutorial would be in this experience. Is that what you're saying.

406
00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:13.300
P3: The 1st green where the list, the topics, one of the above that I would put that you're you're about to complete these clinical reminders of these surveys. If you're not, if you're unfamiliar with surveys.

407
00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:27.470
P3: or you have questions about what this might mean, then have the person click on a button, and that says tutorial, and then it walks you through the security involved, the security associated with it, the the

408
00:39:27.590 --> 00:39:28.515
P3: the

409
00:39:29.610 --> 00:39:37.609
P3: the the how long it might take to complete the survey, so that people can understand that they need to set aside 30 min, or whatever it is you want them to take to

410
00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:52.470
P3: be prepared to use that time solely so. They don't walk away from the screen and makes it easier on everybody. So just answer general questions or provide general responses to people so that they can be more comfortable with going on with the survey

411
00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:58.520
P3: if they if they want to. If they want to get a tutorial. Not everybody needs one like I don't need one.

412
00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:03.599
Moderator: Right exactly. Now, what format would you have this tutorial?

413
00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:12.529
Moderator: Would you have it in video? Would you have it in just just the same format as these questionnaires, or.

414
00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:17.540
P3: I think that most people benefit from visual

415
00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:26.800
P3: information like they're used to watching Tvs or movies or whatever. So I would say, it's probably should be visual that you show a video.

416
00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:38.620
Moderator: Okay? All right. So that's all the questions that I have. And I'm gonna ask my colleagues if they have any questions. Alyssa, do you have any questions.

417
00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:41.479
Alyssa (Notetaker): Hi! No questions for me. Thank you so much for your time.

418
00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:43.960
Moderator: Thank you, questions.

419
00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:56.500
Shawn: I just wanted to say, thanks a lot for taking the time and and specifically your your insight and having technical expertise.

420
00:40:57.060 --> 00:41:01.570
P3: Thank you. I'm a trained program and project manager. So I understand what you're going through.

421
00:41:01.890 --> 00:41:03.129
Shawn: Thank you very much.

422
00:41:03.410 --> 00:41:04.410
P3: Alright. Thank you.

423

Moderator: So thank you again, [redacted PII]. We really appreciate you sharing your thoughts with us today, and your feedback is so very helpful because we're going to use all of this to provide better experiences for other veterans before you go. I just want to mention that everything today was not real, and it doesn't affect your health care in any way.

Moderator: Lastly, Perry, Jean will be sending you a thank you. Note with a little blurb, that you can pass along to other veterans that you may know, giving them a chance to maybe participate in future research studies like this one, and so thank you again and enjoy the rest of your day.
