Participant 12

1
00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:09.319
Moderator: Okay. So I just started recording. And I want to confirm, are you still comfortable with me, recording my screen and audio as we talk today?

2
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:10.510
P12: Yes.

3
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:23.660
Moderator: Perfect. Okay? So before we jump into that demo tool, I want to ask, have you ever filled out health questionnaires from a Va provider, either during an appointment or through email or text.

4
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:24.970
P12: You.

5
00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:26.889
Moderator: And can you tell me about it?

6
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:36.520
P12: To me. It was like just asking you how was, how how was your appointment? How long did it take?

7
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:43.803
P12: Did the nurses show you respect. And

8
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:52.649
P12: and I think I said, Well, it's a Va. Of valuable place to get your help from. There's little questions like that.

9
00:00:52.940 --> 00:01:02.130
Moderator: Yeah. And then, have you also gotten questions at the start of your appointment, or before you even show up about your like health information.

10
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:08.130
P12: No, I was gonna after I left and got back home. Maybe forgot. What's this for?

11
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.989
Moderator: Yeah, when you get them, is it through mail, through email.

12
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:22.969
P12: You know what I get? Some I get, you know I get them through email. And then, like a couple days later, here come the same questionnaire coming in mail.

13
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:23.650
Moderator: Oh!

14
00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.710
P12: So like I've been there, too.

15
00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.150
Moderator: Yeah. And which do you prefer? Email or mail.

16
00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.510
P12: I prefer email

17
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:42.509
P12: because I can do it right then and send it back to that person. Because if I get it in mail, you know. I'll put the mail down and be like.

18
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.300
Moderator: Okay, I forgot about the mail.

19
00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:53.330
Moderator: Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. And when you answer it over email, are you doing it on your phone or on a computer.

20
00:01:54.349 --> 00:02:04.319
P12: If if I if it come through my phone, I'll do it over my phone and send it right back. If I'm at the computer like on the weekend. If I get it like on the weekend.

21
00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.950
P12: I'll do it on the computer because I'd be sitting there. But I always do it to the closest one. I be on.

22
00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.880
Moderator: Got it. And do you use any accessibility features on your phone like a voice over or zoom.

23
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.419
P12: No, I know how to use zoom.

24
00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.320
Moderator: But you don't use accessibility. Features. Yeah.

25
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.360
P12: No, ma'am.

26
00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:44.550
Moderator: Okay? And that's all really good context. And now we're going to jump into our scenario. So we're going to pretend that you have a doctor's appointment in 2 days, and your doctor just emailed you some health questionnaires for you to complete before you show up to your appointment.

27
00:02:44.630 --> 00:03:05.819
Moderator: And so the questions may or may not be related to the appointment, and some of the questions might seem familiar to you, because you've answered them before, while others might seem brand new. And I'm going to have you as you read each screen, just think out loud. Tell me what you think about them, and I'll also ask you some questions along the way.

28
00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:12.560
Moderator: And just a reminder. This is just a demo. So your answers are not going to affect you or your benefits

29
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:13.545
Moderator: and

30
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:20.430
Moderator: So right now in the zoom chat, I'm gonna send a link. But I'm gonna ask you not to click it open yet.

31
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.940
P12: Yes, ma'am.

32
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.670
Moderator: Okay, I just wanna make sure you can see that a link showed up for you in the chat.

33
00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:28.329
P12: Yes, ma'am.

34
00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.660
Moderator: Great. And now I'm gonna ask you to share your screen. Are you on an iphone or android.

35
00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.070
P12: And draw it.

36
00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.599
Moderator: Okay. So I think there should be a share screen button at the bottom.

37
00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.629
P12: Okay, participant. Yeah, it's a share screen at the bottom.

38
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.530
Moderator: And then there should be a bunch of options that come up, and one says, screen.

39
00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.650
P12: Okay, well, let's see, share.

40
00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:58.700
P12: Sure.

41
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.680
P12: Okay? Okay? Screen.

42
00:04:04.192 --> 00:04:07.820
Moderator: And I think you will also need to select like start now.

43
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.910
P12: Okay. So I don't need in a screen name, and none of that.

44
00:04:12.894 --> 00:04:16.129
Moderator: You shouldn't have to enter a screen name.

45
00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.529
P12: Okay, I'm gonna just have to install it then.

46
00:04:19.619 --> 00:04:20.209
P12: Yes.

47
00:04:20.429 --> 00:04:21.929
Moderator: Perfect. Okay.

48
00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:29.399
Moderator: now you're sharing your screen, and I'm going to have you open up the chat one more time. So in that bottom left.

49
00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:33.969
Moderator: There's that little thing poking out. And the red one

50
00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:38.279
Moderator: at the bottom and if you could click that link.

51
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:40.320
P12: Okay.

52
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.020
Moderator: Okay, this is gonna take us to our demo tool

53
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.790
Moderator: and do you know, is this chrome or safari?

54
00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.619
P12: Mys is a is it? 12?

55
00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.889
P12: I think mine may be chrome.

56
00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:04.229
Moderator: Yeah, it looks like chrome to me. Yeah, that sounds about right. And you can just click allow, while visiting the site.

57
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.980
P12: Okay.

58
00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.890
Moderator: Oh,

59
00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:16.200
Moderator: I think you can just say cancel. It should be fine not have your.

60
00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.840
P12: Okay, I see stuff. Now.

61
00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.012
Moderator: Okay. So yeah, this is the 1st screen, and I want you to just

62
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:30.709
Moderator: as if I'm not here, read through it and then tell me out loud what you think before you move on.

63
00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:32.615
P12: Okay,

64
00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:43.019
P12: it's a your clinical reminders. And then it got 4 different thing. And then they say, start clinical reminder.

65
00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:51.030
P12: So you know what I would think I'd be like, okay.

66
00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:58.910
P12: you know. Like, when you get out of the military, you have to take the toxic exposure screaming so

67
00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:00.800
P12: I would like.

68
00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:10.959
P12: probably take that one and the one for sexual be the only 2 that I would take, because the other 2. Don't pertain to me.

69
00:06:12.001 --> 00:06:21.479
Moderator: Okay, that's good to know. In this particular case. Let's say the email you got from your doctor says

70
00:06:21.938 --> 00:06:26.679
Moderator: they sent you 4 clinical reminders, and they want you to answer all 4

71
00:06:27.688 --> 00:06:30.121
Moderator: and also for context.

72
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:38.039
Moderator: the reason why there's no login, username or password is because this is a 1 time link that is only for you.

73
00:06:39.093 --> 00:06:43.850
Moderator: Yes, so could you tell me what you do next?

74
00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:57.119
P12: Okay, I would start start start clinical reminders, because that probably put me on to the the full things that I have to go through with go through.

75
00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:00.099
Moderator: Sure, and you can go ahead and do that.

76
00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:03.209
P12: Okay, and it's loading.

77
00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:12.940
P12: And then the 1st one is, do you think you were exposed to talk to hazard while in the armed forces, I would say yes.

78
00:07:14.432 --> 00:07:16.090
Moderator: And then anything.

79
00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.709
P12: So do you actually want me to click what I would say.

80
00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:28.050
Moderator: Yes, but before you move on, I also want to ask you, is there anything unexpected or confusing on this page?

81
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.600
P12: No, ma'am, no, ma'am.

82
00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:39.050
Moderator: Good and also because you're gonna be seeing a number of questions I want to share that. We're mostly

83
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:51.189
Moderator: looking for feedback on the layout of the page, and how you navigate between questions. And so we're less focused on the actual wording of the questions themselves.

84
00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:56.159
P12: Okay, the 1st page, the 1st page is like a simple Yes, no.

85
00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.480
P12: And like

86
00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:04.189
P12: a person that didn't know computer, would, you know? Probably answer, Yes, no, it's not confusing to me.

87
00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:10.290
Moderator: Okay, that's great. That's good to know and you can go ahead and move on to the next page.

88
00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:19.490
P12: All right. The next page. It's still self self explanatory. You know what you

89
00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:22.570
P12: what you was exposed to.

90
00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:29.800
P12: Okay.

91
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:32.049
P12: Alright. Do you want more?

92
00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:34.730
Moderator: Any feedback about the previous page.

93
00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:43.499
P12: No, ma'am, it's self explanatory where you just click what you what you were exposed to.

94
00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:48.519
Moderator: Got it. Okay? And now you can keep on going and do this page.

95
00:08:56.308 --> 00:08:59.279
Moderator: I see you're selecting them all. Can you tell me more about that?

96
00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:02.899
P12: Okay, the one for the health medical question.

97
00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:11.090
P12: That one right there may get you on that. What's it called the register list. I think that's what they call.

98
00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:16.920
P12: And then the benefit question. If you were trying to apply for disability.

99
00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:23.290
P12: you would probably get more information about that. And then the one with the Va.

100
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:26.220
P12: Va. Care enrollment.

101
00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:33.299
P12: It's probably, for if you haven't enrolled in the Va. Medical staff.

102
00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:45.799
P12: And then the environment health thing is the one what we get you on like the Burn Pit register, the radiation register, and it's a nerd out there. I can't think of what it is right now.

103
00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:46.880
P12: Yeah.

104
00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.059
P12: Toxic toxic water. One.

105
00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:56.119
Moderator: Got it. And so you've clicked all of them because you want more information about all of these different categories.

106
00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.266
Moderator: Perfect. Okay,

107
00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:05.320
Moderator: So if there's nothing else for this page, you can go ahead onto the next question.

108
00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:07.370
P12: Okay.

109
00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:14.700
P12: it's like my page flow, is it closed? Maybe there's me.

110
00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:16.410
Moderator: Hmm.

111
00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:21.790
P12: It's like when I click next. I don't get nothing else. I'm trying to click next.

112
00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:31.339
Moderator: Oh, that's strange! Let's imagine if I wasn't here, what would you try to do next?

113
00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:33.080
P12: Oh.

114
00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:42.299
P12: I would go back previous. I would go back to the previous question, and then see could I go back to next and see what it make it go.

115
00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:44.350
Moderator: Sure you can go ahead and do that.

116
00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:46.390
P12: Okay.

117
00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:50.380
P12: Alright. Then I did back. And then I'm gonna go next.

118
00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:58.309
P12: Okay, me and my next ain't women.

119
00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:13.209
Moderator: So it seems like you found a bug and so if you were stuck on this page and you can't move forward, what would you try to do next if I weren't here.

120
00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:22.559
P12: but see! Could I go back to the 1st page? And did it have any phone number or anything to call.

121
00:11:23.375 --> 00:11:25.340
Moderator: So you can go ahead and try that.

122
00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:28.030
P12: Previous.

123
00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:36.399
P12: Okay, now, I don't have no phone number to call. So.

124
00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:38.420
Moderator: Hmm.

125
00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:44.870
P12: So wait a minute. Let me go and talk with the bail that no, that ain't working

126
00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:50.040
P12: so is it's really nothing I can do

127
00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:56.749
P12: but like try to start all the way over, but I can't, and every time I go back to the 1st one

128
00:11:56.850 --> 00:12:06.110
P12: it don't have nothing there, it just say what I was when I was checking so.

129
00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:13.269
Moderator: Yeah, it's it's confusing. So if I weren't here, how would you try to get help for this.

130
00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:19.440
P12: Quite how. How? My medical provider who send it to me

131
00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:23.229
P12: and tell her. You know I was trying to answer the question.

132
00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:37.560
P12: but you know, when I got to a certain section on it like it froze up, and I went back, and then when I went back, I couldn't go back forward and see what she would say, and they probably would send me a paperwork, a whole long list of paperwork in mail to fill out.

133
00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:41.199
Moderator: Yeah, yeah. And how do, how do you feel about that?

134
00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:55.089
P12: I would fill it out. I don't have a problem filling a lot of paperwork, but it's no easier if it's on the email. And you can just do it right then and send it back to them. But I would fill a lot on.

135
00:12:55.370 --> 00:13:02.269
P12: I would put a lot on paperwork because it's like it may be something that would be could help me one day

136
00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:04.060
P12: that I really need.

137
00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:07.110
Moderator: Yeah. So you wanna get the question done? Yeah.

138
00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:08.230
P12: Yes, ma'am.

139
00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:26.760
Moderator: Okay? So there is just a funny bug on this particular website. What happens is that when you click previous, if you don't change your response, it doesn't let you submit it again. And so what you could do here is just move your cursor to know

140
00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:28.920
Moderator: and then move it back to. Yes.

141
00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:34.219
Moderator: cause that just refreshes the page. And now, you can move forward.

142
00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.679
P12: Okay. So I'm okay.

143
00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:38.430
Moderator: Yeah.

144
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:46.409
Moderator: So it's just a a quirk that needs to be fixed. But it was really helpful to hear about how you'd want to get help.

145
00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:59.960
P12: So I'm back at the same spot. So I gotta take some off. Okay, you should take some off on this page.

146
00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:02.025
Moderator: Yeah. And then

147
00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:04.330
P12: Rebecca.

148
00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:13.093
Moderator: Yeah. Here, I think if you scroll up all that's the thing

149
00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:19.160
Moderator: you can hit cancel.

150
00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:20.590
P12: -Oh.

151
00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:25.800
Moderator: And also, yeah. So I know on web pages. Sometimes if you

152
00:14:26.383 --> 00:14:32.036
Moderator: scroll up in a certain way it refreshes it, and so sorry that we lost your

153
00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:36.260
P12: I went back trying to do it over.

154
00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:44.200
Moderator: Yeah. But if you scroll very carefully, I think there should be a question at the top of this page

155
00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:47.780
Moderator: on top of on top of this one.

156
00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:51.890
Moderator: Okay.

157
00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:57.960
P12: You said, we'll connect you with someone who can help answer your question. We'll also send you

158
00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:01.700
P12: a text message email with more information.

159
00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:07.930
Moderator: Yeah. Could you put your thumb like where the will connect you is, and try and scroll up a little more.

160
00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:15.800
P12: We were connected. We are connect.

161
00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:25.170
Moderator: Just at the the words at the top of the page. If you try and scroll up, I think there's a question at the top that yeah.

162
00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:25.860
P12: Oh, okay.

163
00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:28.560
Moderator: I don't know why it didn't start you at the top.

164
00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:37.510
P12: Veteran. It's a veteran. Caregiver was made, was made aware of the education resources.

165
00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:45.550
P12: how to file a claim, print information off and provide you click. Confirm right there.

166
00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:47.329
Moderator: Yes.

167
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:48.740
P12: Okay.

168
00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:52.678
P12: Okay? Then it go down. Okay. Next, we're not.

169
00:15:53.060 --> 00:16:02.840
Moderator: So before we move on, I just wanna hear your thoughts about that. What do you think just happened? And then how do you feel about it?

170
00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:14.299
P12: what just happened? Maybe if I was taking it on a computer screen it would have been different. And

171
00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:20.640
P12: I I would have seen everything. But to me, taking on the phone and a computer screen is the same.

172
00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:26.839
P12: So. But maybe if I was on a computer screen I would have seen that top question.

173
00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:36.329
Moderator: Yeah. Yeah. And then for getting help again, you would want to call your provider, or whoever sent you this until you figured it out, okay.

174
00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:40.720
Moderator: cool. So you can continue.

175
00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:44.370
P12: Okay, then submit.

176
00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:46.740
P12: Then it said, Okay.

177
00:16:46.740 --> 00:17:04.239
Moderator: So now, before we move on to this next set of questions, I want to ask for the toxic exposure screener. How easy or difficult was it to answer those questions. Where one is very easy and 5 is very difficult.

178
00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:05.700
P12: One.

179
00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:09.400
Moderator: Could you share more.

180
00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:16.080
P12: To me it was very easy, like self-explanatory questions.

181
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:19.749
P12: So you pick you pick what pertains to you.

182
00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:26.339
Moderator: Yeah, that's helpful to know and now we can move on to this next set of questions.

183
00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:27.500
P12: Okay.

184
00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:37.559
Moderator: So same thing. What did you think about the previous page?

185
00:17:39.397 --> 00:17:41.370
P12: It was self-explanatory.

186
00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:45.310
Moderator: And then you can continue.

187
00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:09.049
P12: Okay, then this page. It was self explanatory, self, explanatory.

188
00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:10.220
Moderator: Okay.

189
00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:25.360
Moderator: And this is also those were the only homelessness and food insecurity questions. So I want to ask, how easy or difficult was it to answer those questions on a scale of one to 5? Again.

190
00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:29.199
P12: It was it was one. It was very easy.

191
00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:33.270
Moderator: Okay, great. And now you can continue.

192
00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:53.300
Moderator: And I actually I can't see your face while you're sharing screen. And so I can't tell if you I can't tell if you look confused, I can't tell if you look like it's easy. So if you could just tell me out loud what you're thinking. That would be really helpful.

193
00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:57.660
P12: Okay on this page. I don't smoke. I don't smoke at all. So.

194
00:18:57.860 --> 00:18:58.420
Moderator: Yes.

195
00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:06.940
P12: That's that's an easy question. Just hit next. But I don't. I never smoked cigarettes or smoke 2 of them. I never smoked.

196
00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:08.999
Moderator: Okay, so great feel free to.

197
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:22.049
P12: But you know what you know this page is. If you had a question, I do not smoke cigarettes, but down there you say I never smoked cigarette, or I smoke fewer than a 100 cigarette in a lifetime. So to me

198
00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:24.510
P12: that that course news.

199
00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:29.249
P12: It's like contradicting himself. Yes, I smoke, but I don't smoke no more.

200
00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:35.020
Moderator: Hmm! So you wish there is a separate option which said, I never smoked ever.

201
00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:44.259
P12: Yeah, because, like the one up there, I I currently use cigarette. So this one should. It should be a section here saying, I do not smoke.

202
00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:45.490
Moderator: Yeah.

203
00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:46.690
P12: Yeah.

204
00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:47.870
Moderator: Yeah, I think so.

205
00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:48.990
P12: So that's okay.

206
00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:55.960
P12: Okay.

207
00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:02.091
P12: So that that's the only thing I see on that page that need to be

208
00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:05.949
P12: that need to be that one of the question need to be added.

209
00:20:08.428 --> 00:20:10.719
Moderator: Could you tell me more.

210
00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:23.809
P12: Is it? You know the page on that word asking you, have you ever smoked? And all of that it should be on that one that say I never! I do not smoke. I never smoke

211
00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:30.570
P12: like the one up there at the top that say, I currently smoke. It should be a question that say I do not smoke, never.

212
00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:38.089
Moderator: Yes, so you're saying there should be one more option in the multiple choice that says.

213
00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:40.090
P12: Yeah, I do not smoke.

214
00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:41.924
Moderator: Yes, yes, correct.

215
00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:56.750
Moderator: Okay. So before we move on to this last question, on a scale of one to 5, very easy to very difficult. How easy or difficult was it to answer the tobacco, use questions.

216
00:20:57.470 --> 00:21:00.845
P12: I'm gonna say 2, because they didn't have my answer.

217
00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:23.270
Moderator: Yeah. Yeah. And then, before we do this last question, I'm gonna do a quick hypothetical. So let's pretend you just received a call from a friend while you're in the middle of this questionnaire, and it's very important. So you know, you're not going to be able to finish this questionnaire right now. What would you try to do next?

218
00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:24.640
P12: Oh.

219
00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:39.809
P12: tell the friend, you know. Could you call me back in like 10 min? I'm doing some paperwork for the Va. That I gotta have in by a certain time, and hopefully, that friend will understand.

220
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:46.859
Moderator: Yeah, let's say, it's a very important call I'm more interested in what you would try to do on your screen, or what you would expect.

221
00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:48.660
P12: Oh, God!

222
00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:52.963
Moderator: Oh, that's funny! You did get a call.

223
00:21:54.640 --> 00:22:01.049
P12: Yeah, them like a spam call, even if well.

224
00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:08.090
P12: I would see, could I, you know, minimize the question and answer the very important call.

225
00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:09.860
Moderator: Yes.

226
00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:13.120
P12: Yeah, I would minimize minimum minimize it.

227
00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:32.180
Moderator: Yeah, so to, I'm going to have you just pretend that like you were on the phone for long enough that this system logged you out and and then you want to return to it. So to

228
00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:36.939
Moderator: pretend like that happened. If you could click the 9 at the very top of the page.

229
00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:40.400
P12: Okay. Okay.

230
00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:43.790
Moderator: I think that'll just let you X out the window.

231
00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:47.250
Moderator: So if you could press the X button.

232
00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:50.300
P12: Okay.

233
00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:54.440
Moderator: And then, if you could go back to the zoom and just open the link up again.

234
00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:57.189
P12: Event to the Zone.

235
00:23:00.051 --> 00:23:04.969
Moderator: So I think on the bottom of your bottom left. There's this little arrow.

236
00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:07.130
P12: Okay.

237
00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:09.060
Moderator: Oh, the bottom left side!

238
00:23:11.578 --> 00:23:14.130
Moderator: There's this little arrow like peeking out. Oh.

239
00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:14.740
P12: Okay.

240
00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:15.240
Moderator: It's also.

241
00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:16.010
P12: I got you.

242
00:23:16.895 --> 00:23:20.920
Moderator: So if you can click that link again on this page.

243
00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:23.060
P12: Okay.

244
00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:26.866
Moderator: Perfect. So we imagine that

245
00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:36.920
Moderator: after you finish your call, you were logged out because it was a while, and now you're trying to go back and finish your reminders.

246
00:23:37.537 --> 00:23:40.959
Moderator: So is this what you expected to see.

247
00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:47.199
P12: Yeah, somewhat. Once I got back in and I probably

248
00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:56.389
P12: could see, could I go? Well, yeah, it do. Got back here. The one that I haven't completed, because all the rest of them say completed. August the 8, th 2025.

249
00:23:56.850 --> 00:24:00.050
Moderator: Yeah, and is this what you expected?

250
00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:01.480
P12: Yes, ma'am.

251
00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:07.509
Moderator: Okay? And how would you resume the questions.

252
00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:15.699
P12: Start start 1st I would see could I mesh on the one that I have not done.

253
00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:27.669
P12: and see what it let me back in. But then I see I got a mess start clinical reminders, and then they go back to the sexual orientation questions. So I'm back where I stopped at.

254
00:24:28.716 --> 00:24:33.819
Moderator: And was, did that make sense for you.

255
00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:39.100
P12: Yeah, it make. It makes sense. This, the Va we working with. So it makes sense.

256
00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:43.330
Moderator: Okay, I noticed that you tried to click on the specific reminder.

257
00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:44.920
P12: Yeah, do you?

258
00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:46.690
P12: Yeah, take the.

259
00:24:47.577 --> 00:24:50.199
Moderator: Yeah, and then that didn't work.

260
00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:55.959
P12: Yeah. So I'd like, gotta go back, start reminders and see what that would.

261
00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:56.960
Moderator: Okay.

262
00:24:57.550 --> 00:25:02.949
Moderator: cool. And then if you could go ahead and answer this question and tell me what you think about it.

263
00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:10.190
P12: Okay, it's it's great to your sexual sexual origination.

264
00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:17.880
Moderator: So, yeah, and anything here that seems confusing or unclear.

265
00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:19.530
P12: No.

266
00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:22.060
Moderator: Okay, so now you can.

267
00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:23.969
P12: You know what

268
00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:38.920
P12: all the questions, all the answer they given they sort of is 2 of them. The same. 2 of the questions is the same meaning. And then 2 of the other questions is the same meaning. So I guess it. I guess it's what you prefer

269
00:25:39.570 --> 00:25:49.190
P12: your session on, like lesbian or gay and Bisex. Lesbian, gay and queer is the same thing to me.

270
00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:58.010
P12: and then straight and heterosexual and bisexual is the same. It's it's is what you prefer

271
00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:04.100
P12: like. I'm straight. So I was like man, straight or heterosex. So both of them are the same.

272
00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:09.070
Moderator: So you think there should be fewer options here.

273
00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:12.679
P12: Yeah, just either put you know

274
00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:19.540
P12: what they it. To me. The question is, what you prefer to be labeled as.

275
00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:28.401
Moderator: So let's say, you have a term like this,

276
00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:43.650
Moderator: or not necessarily this question, but in general you're filling out this questionnaire. There's this word you don't understand, or you find confusing. How would you get help to figure out what it means

277
00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:47.089
Moderator: like in the context of the questionnaire?

278
00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:49.105
P12: You can, either.

279
00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:54.759
P12: you know, you can put it in Google. See what it say and go from there.

280
00:26:55.100 --> 00:27:01.180
P12: you can put in, you know, like, look, look the word up on Google as somebody in your house. What does it mean?

281
00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:03.350
P12: Yes, yes.

282
00:27:04.719 --> 00:27:11.310
Moderator: That makes sense. So if there are no other comments on this page, you can go ahead and continue.

283
00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:19.900
Moderator: Okay. So now, what do you see?

284
00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:22.463
P12: It's a

285
00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:36.110
P12: recommended. Wait a minute, I'm I'm finished with all the questions. Then it got recommended. Education, Pnr exercise, restores, and education be a whole

286
00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:37.440
P12: whole health.

287
00:27:38.290 --> 00:27:40.389
Moderator: So what would you do next?

288
00:27:40.810 --> 00:27:49.580
P12: Oh, click! On whichever one I would be interested in, and then see like, be a whole health.

289
00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:51.140
P12: I will click on that.

290
00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:52.559
Moderator: Sure. Go ahead!

291
00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:06.259
P12: And then it say, Are are you ready to start your whole health journey? Then you put your email in and subscribe.

292
00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:10.300
Moderator: So is it.

293
00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:14.620
P12: It's an easy page. It's self as self explanatory.

294
00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:17.570
Moderator: Okay, so is this what you expected?

295
00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:18.830
P12: Yeah.

296
00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:37.700
Moderator: Okay, great. And then, that's actually all for the demo tool, since you finish all of the questions. And now I just wanna ask you a few questions about what that experience was like. So if you could return to the zoom and stop sharing screen.

297
00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:48.019
Moderator: so same thing that you did earlier. Yeah, back here, and then the stop share button is going to be the red X in the bottom left.

298
00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:52.010
P12: Hi.

299
00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:59.289
Moderator: Great. Okay? And let's see if your video turns back on. Now that you're you've stopped sharing.

300
00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:02.183
Moderator: Great. Hello!

301
00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:03.520
P12: Oh!

302
00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:12.410
Moderator: Hi, okay. So now that we're done going through these pages, I just want to ask can you tell me about your overall impression of the prototype.

303
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:16.308
P12: It was. It was a great prototype.

304
00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:22.549
P12: if they add just that one question. And and you know it would be, it would be okay.

305
00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:24.490
Moderator: What's the one question?

306
00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:26.319
P12: I do not smoke.

307
00:29:26.590 --> 00:29:28.352
Moderator: Oh, yes, yes,

308
00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:37.009
Moderator: that's good to know. And what did you notice about the process? And like the interaction of submitting the questionnaire.

309
00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:40.439
P12: It's user is user friendly.

310
00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:45.456
P12: It's user users, friendly.

311
00:29:46.290 --> 00:29:50.119
Moderator: Yeah. And were there any parts that didn't match what you thought should happen.

312
00:29:51.378 --> 00:30:01.689
P12: No, no, it got stuck. And yet to figure out how to get it unstuck. And so it was just like, I imagine.

313
00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:05.509
Moderator: You imagine that you would get stuck, but then you have to figure out.

314
00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:06.160
P12: But

315
00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:15.540
P12: yeah, that's the Va. I've been at the Va. Long enough. You know, you're not gonna always go straight through some. Something is gonna happen.

316
00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:24.729
Moderator: Hmm, yeah. So how does this prototype compare to other like email questionnaire platforms you've had to fill out.

317
00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:30.370
P12: Is is it's about the same.

318
00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:41.280
P12: Yeah, so it was. It wasn't hard at all to me, and you know it was. It was easy.

319
00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:44.120
Moderator: Okay, that's

320
00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:54.109
Moderator: helpful feedback. And how do you feel about using this type of tool for questions about your personal health information like, do you feel like it was safe and secure.

321
00:30:56.630 --> 00:31:02.489
P12: Yeah. Anything coming from the Va. Is safe and secure long as you stay on their page

322
00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:09.310
P12: and you stay on their page. Everything goes through. So yeah, I'm I'm really

323
00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:12.200
P12: sure. That was it was safe.

324
00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:20.080
Moderator: Okay, like, if you got this link through email, how would you verify or know that it's safe.

325
00:31:22.010 --> 00:31:29.409
P12: with the Va. Is always gonna have some.gov dot gov in it at the head of the

326
00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:38.180
P12: where it's coming from. So once you always click on that email that you got from the Va. You're going to be safe.

327
00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:44.029
P12: I ain't. I ain't seen too many people that can scam

328
00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:50.400
P12: the Va email that's coming straight from them. If you go off the page. And

329
00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:54.620
P12: yeah, you're gonna get in trouble. But stay on the email that they send you.

330
00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:59.780
Moderator: Okay, yeah, that makes sense. And then.

331
00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:06.309
Moderator: what did you think about the length of time it took to complete the experience? Was it reasonable or unreasonable?

332
00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:09.660
P12: It was reasonable, it was reasonable, reasonable.

333
00:32:11.232 --> 00:32:16.379
Moderator: and then if you could change one thing about the entire questionnaire, experience, what would it be.

334
00:32:19.550 --> 00:32:24.236
P12: Like, if you get like, if you get stuck, you know

335
00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:33.620
P12: what where to go. We had to go back and back, but then I realized that it was a question at the top.

336
00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:37.759
P12: That I had not answered was the reason I couldn't go forward.

337
00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:44.110
Moderator: Hmm, yeah. So if I weren't here, how would you want that to be fixed.

338
00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:54.000
P12: I would probably, you know, try to keep the questionnaire on my phone and then go log into my computer

339
00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:59.419
P12: and see, can I fix it that way. So have, like 2 devices, open.

340
00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:00.600
Moderator: Yeah.

341
00:33:01.142 --> 00:33:10.209
Moderator: But how would you? If you could tell the people who make these questionnaires how to make it so? People don't have that issue.

342
00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:11.390
Moderator: What would you want.

343
00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:13.460
P12: And

344
00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:26.800
P12: try to put the course in. Try to put the course in them close together, you know, like once you go on the page. Make make sure you can see that top course, and like, put 1, 2, number it, number it, and that will be better.

345
00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:29.460
P12: Put numbers like 1, 2, 3.

346
00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:46.729
Moderator: Yeah, yeah, it's helpful. And finally, if you had to interact with this prototype to answer questions about your health care on a regular and consistent basis. How satisfied or dissatisfied would you be.

347
00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:49.189
P12: I'll be very satisfied.

348
00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:51.590
Moderator: Okay. Can you tell me more?

349
00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:58.265
P12: It's pretty easy ample to.

350
00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:13.399
P12: It's it's real easy and simple, you know, because I I work on the computer all the time I work at work. I do work on. I do my work on the computer so it will be simple for me.

351
00:34:13.670 --> 00:34:20.000
Moderator: Yes, yeah, that makes sense. And I seem to have lost your video just a couple of seconds ago.

352
00:34:20.449 --> 00:34:21.389
P12: Did you.

353
00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:24.260
Moderator: Yeah, maybe it was just a button.

354
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.330
P12: Okay. Yeah.

355
00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:32.670
Moderator: Yeah.

356
00:34:32.679 --> 00:34:33.359
P12: Can you hear me?

357
00:34:33.850 --> 00:34:38.620
Moderator: I can still hear you. But your video turned off. I don't know why.

358
00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:40.000
P12: Oh, let's see!

359
00:34:48.569 --> 00:34:57.109
Moderator: Okay, perfect. That is actually the very end. Anyway, I just wanted to ask, do you have any questions for me?

360
00:34:58.250 --> 00:34:59.135
P12: No

361
00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:05.306
P12: So by me taking this it should improve

362
00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:09.110
P12: like the Va. Stuff they sent out.

363
00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:26.780
Moderator: Yeah. So this means that whenever the Va starts sending out these digital health questions that we know that we need to fix that back button, for example. And so it's really good that in talking to you today, I got feedback about

364
00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:30.600
Moderator: like being able to go back

365
00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:47.469
Moderator: and 4th through questions. You shared feedback about the like. I've never smoked or smoked fewer than. And so this type of session is really helpful for us to understand how we can make these products really work for veterans.

366
00:35:48.010 --> 00:35:48.760
P12: Okay.

367
00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:54.720
P12: So I mean taking it. What was the incentive to take it other than to help the Va.

368
00:35:56.596 --> 00:35:59.220
Moderator: The incentive of who.

369
00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:04.589
P12: Like for me to take it. I know I know I was helping the Va. But like

370
00:36:04.810 --> 00:36:08.450
P12: was that the incentive to help the Va. Fix stuff.

371
00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:29.599
Notetaker: I'm gonna jump in here because I think that's the question for us for Perigin. So the incentive was, once this is done, I'm gonna send you a thank you email, and in case your in case your mailing address has changed, let me know, because on Monday I'm going to be sending you a check. So if your mailing.

372
00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:30.170
P12: Oh, okay.

373
00:36:30.170 --> 00:36:32.909
Notetaker: Changed. Let me know. Before Monday.

374
00:36:33.410 --> 00:36:37.590
P12: No, you haven't changed. Still got the 6 30 Method Street, Thompson, Georgia.

375
00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:43.080
Notetaker: Okay, okay? So yeah. So on Monday I will send you a paper check.

376
00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:44.010
P12: Logan.

377
00:36:44.382 --> 00:36:45.500
Notetaker: That's the incentive.

378
00:36:46.210 --> 00:36:48.489
P12: Okay. Alright. Okay. Yeah.

379
00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:51.835
Moderator: Sorry I thought you were asking what aren't.

380
00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:53.080
P12: No, no.

381
00:36:53.080 --> 00:37:02.760
Moderator: Point was, okay, yeah. So as Chantelle said, she's gonna send you a thank you. Note. And it's also going to include a little

382
00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:27.749
Moderator: blurb that you can pass along to other veterans, you may know, to give them the chance to participate in research like this, and also get that financial incentive. And I just want to say, Thank you so much for taking the time to share your thoughts with us. Your feedback is really so helpful, and I just want to reiterate that everything we did today wasn't real. So the questions you answered aren't going to be submitted to your

383
00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:29.729
Moderator: care provider or anything.

384
00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:31.090
P12: Okay.

385
00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:32.200
Moderator: That's web.

386
00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:38.510
P12: But thank you for taking the time, for let me pull off, because I thought I had time to get home.

387
00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:43.410
Moderator: No worries. Thank you so much for your time. Happy Friday.

388
00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:44.890
P12: Same to you.

389
00:37:44.890 --> 00:37:45.385
Moderator: Bye.

390
00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:47.390
P12: Alright, bye-bye.
