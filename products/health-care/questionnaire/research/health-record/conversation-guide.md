## Project-specific setup and Intro - 10 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Kristen and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to discuss how you communicate medication, allergy, and immunization changes to your VA provider. Then, you will help us prioritize and group together medication, allergy, and immunization information that we could display in a new va.gov feature.

- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve our tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **This entire session should take about an hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 

**Recording Instructions**

- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?"** 

Great. Now we're really ready to begin!

## Warm-up Questions - 10 minutes
To begin, we would like to get to know you a little better and understand your experiences with medications, allergies (or intolerances, like lactose intolerance), and any immunizations that you received in the past few years (such as flu shots or COVID).
- How much of your medical care do you receive from the VA? (A great deal/All, Quite a bit, Somewhat, Very little, or None at all)
- How do you keep track of your medications, immunizations, and allergies?
  - What do you like about your current process?
  - What is frustrating about keeping track of your medications?
- How do you keep your VA providers up-to-date on your medications? For instance, maybe you stopped taking a medication or you were prescribed a new medication from a non-VA provider, how did you let your VA providers know?
  - How did the process of communicating those changes to the VA go?
  - If you take any supplements, vitamins, or over-the-counter medications, do you share that with your VA providers? 
    - If yes, how did those experiences of letting your VA provider go? What methods did you utilize to communicate the change?
- Have you ever let your VA provider know about any changes to your allergy history?
  - If yes, how did those experiences of letting your VA provider go? What methods did you utilize to communicate the change?
- Have you ever received an immunization at a non-VA facility, maybe a non-VA provider's office or a pharmacy? 
  - If yes, how did you let your VA provider know about those immunizations? How did those experiences of letting your VA provider go? What methods did you utilize to communicate the change?
- Do you get a flu shot every year? If so, where? If non-VA location, do they tell their VA provider? If not, why not?
- Have they gotten their COVID vaccine? If yes, was it at a VA facility?  If no, are they planning on getting the vaccine and where do they plan on getting it?
  - If they got their COVID vaccine, how was their overall experience?
- _Only ask if necessary, depending upon how the Veteran answered the past three questions, if they didn't talk about their actual appointments with their providers._ How do you prepare for your appointment when you have changes you would like to discuss with your VA provider?
  - Observers: Take note if anyone mentions printing.
- Do you utilize MyHealtheVet?
  - If yes, 
    - Have you ever checked your medication list on there?
      - Were those list easy or hard to understand? If hard, what did you find challenging?
    - Have you ever utilized secure message to notify your VA provider of medication, allergy, or immunization changes?
- How can we make it more easier for you to communicate to your VA providers?

# Mural Activity - 30 minutes
Next, we will complete an activity that helps prioritize and group information that we could display online in medication, allergy, and immunization sections. Let me share my screen with you, so we can start this activity: [Mural link](https://app.mural.co/t/vsa8243/m/vsa8243/1612803040285/9ee796589a8531afe6837796feb42a5dfd2e7037).

- Observers: Take note of what pieces of data or features the Veteran doesn't understand. Also, note the reasons why the Veteran ranked and grouped things a certain way.

## Immunizations Section - 10 minutes
First, we will start with immunizations. I'm going to show you a bunch information that we could display on va.gov for immunizations. We are going to review them one-by-one. Let me know if you don't understand the item, then I'm going to have you rank them by how valuable they are to see displayed online.

Is there anything that should be added to immunizations that we didn't already review? I can create a blank post-it for your idea.

Now, let's group things together that you believe should be displayed together. 

## Medications Section - 10 minutes
Just as you did with immunizations, we are going to do the same thing with medications. We are going to review each item one-by-one. Let me know if you don't understand the item, then I'm going to have you rank them by how valuable they are to see displayed online.

Is there anything that should be added to medications that we didn't already review? I can create a blank post-it for your idea.

Now, let's group things together that you believe should be displayed together. 

## Allergies Section - 10 minutes
Lastly, we are going to do the same thing with allergies. We are going to review each item one-by-one. Let me know if you don't understand the item, then I'm going to have you rank them by how valuable they are to see displayed online.

Is there anything that should be added to allergies that we didn't already review? I can create a blank post-it for your idea.

Now, let's group things together that you believe should be displayed together.

# Wrap-up Questions - 5 minutes
- Pretend you developed a new medication allergy, such as a rash when you take penicillin. Would you add that medication allergy on the medication section and/or the allergy section?
- How often do you expect to update each of these sections? Would you want to see these sections in a questionnaire before every VA appointment? Would you want to see these sections once every six months or some other time period?
- If we could only build one of these topics into a pre-visit questionnaire, which one would you prefer? Would you pick medications, allergies, and immunizations?
  - Why?
- Do you think adding these pages to a pre-visit questionnaire will help or not help you explain changes to your medications, allergies, and immunizations to your VA provider?
  - Why?
- Is there anything about medications, allergies, and immunizations that I should know about that I didn't cover today?
- Do you have any final questions for me?

## Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
