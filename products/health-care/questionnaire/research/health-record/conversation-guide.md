## Project-specific setup and Intro - 10 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Kristen and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to discuss how you communicate medication, allergy, and immunization changes to your VA provider. Then, you will help us prioritize and group together medication, allergy, and immunization information that we could display in a new va.gov feature.

- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve our tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **This entire session should take about an hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- Talk them through Zoom screen sharing and chat features shown in document.
  - [Screen share and walk through this document if necessary](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lo44N4rTBDaHfcsjX6bCV1a--YJSTPXSXnZbywB71J0/edit?usp=sharing)
  - Send [Mural link](https://app.mural.co/t/vsa8243/m/vsa8243/1612803040285/9ee796589a8531afe6837796feb42a5dfd2e7037) and have them screenshare it now.


**Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:**

- Ok, it seems like we're having some trouble sharing your screen. I'm really excited for you to participate though, so what we're going to do today is have me share my screen, and then I'm going to have you "Drive". You will tell me what to do, what to tap on, etc. Does that sound ok?
- [Share your screen]. Can you confirm if you can see my screen?

**Recording Instructions**

- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?"** 

Great. Now we're really ready to begin!

## Warm-up Questions - 10 minutes
To begin, we would like to get to know you a little better and understand your experiences with medications, allergies (or intolerances, like lactose intolerance), and any immunizations that you received in the past few years (such as flu shots or COVID).
- How much of your medical care do you receive from the VA? (A great deal/All, Quite a bit, Somewhat, Very little, or None at all)
- How do you keep track of your medications, immunizations, and allergies?
  - What do you like about your current process?
  - What is frustrating about keeping track of your medications?
- How do you keep your VA providers up-to-date on your medications? For instance, maybe you stopped taking a medication or you were prescribed a new medication from a non-VA provider, how did you let your VA providers know?
  - How did the process of communicating those changes to the VA go?
  - If you take any supplements, vitamins, or over-the-counter medications, do you share that with your VA providers? 
    - If yes, how did those experiences of letting your VA provider go? What methods did you utilize to communicate the change?
- Have you ever let your VA provider know about any changes to your allergy history?
  - If yes, how did those experiences of letting your VA provider go? What methods did you utilize to communicate the change?
- Have you ever received an immunization at a non-VA facility, maybe a non-VA provider's office or a pharmacy? 
  - If yes, how did you let your VA provider know about those immunizations? How did those experiences of letting your VA provider go? What methods did you utilize to communicate the change?
- _Only ask if necessary, depending upon how the Veteran answered the past three questions, if they didn't talk about their actual appointments with their providers._ How do you prepare for your appointment when you have changes you would like to discuss with your VA provider?
  - Observers: Take note if anyone mentions printing.
- Do you utilize MyHealtheVet?
  - If yes, 
    - Have you ever checked your medication list on there?
      - Were those list easy or hard to understand? If hard, what did you find challenging?
    - Have you ever utilized secure message to notify your VA provider of medication, allergy, or immunization changes?
- How can we make it more easier for you to communicate to your VA providers?

# Mural Activity - 30 minutes
Next, imagine that you received a questionnaire to fill out prior to your VA appointment via text or email. Within this questionnaire, you can let the VA know about any medication, allergy, or immunization changes. In this activity, we need your help prioritizing and grouping together information that we can display on the medication, allergy, and immunization interfaces within the questionnaire.

## Medications Section - 10 minutes
Currently on the screen there is a blank area with the word "medications" on it. Pretend this is the medications section of the questionnaire. Next to it are a bunch of things about medications that could go on this page. 

First, review all of the medication pieces and let me know if you don't understand any of them.
- Observers: Take note on what pieces of data or features the Veteran doesn't understand.

Now, move any of the pieces that you find valuable over to the medication page. Pretend you are making the medications page. Group things together that you believe should be displayed together. Don't feel like you have to use all of the pieces. If a piece isn't valuable to you, then don't include it. If you think of something to add that we don't show as one of the pieces, feel free to use one of the blank post-it notes that I have on the screen to type in your idea.
- Any questions?

## Immunizations Section - 10 minutes
Just as you did with medications, we are going to do the same thing with immunizations. First, review all of the immunization pieces and let me know if you don't understand any of them.
- Observers: Take note on what pieces of data or features the Veteran doesn't understand.

Next, move any of the pieces that you find valuable over to the immunizations page. Pretend you are making the immunizations page. Group things together that you believe should be displayed together. Again, don't feel like you have to use all the pieces and use a post-it note to add any ideas.

## Allergies Section - 10 minutes
Lastly, we are going to do the same thing with allergies. Review all of the allergy pieces and let me know if you don't understand any of them.
- Observers: Take note on what pieces of data or features the Veteran doesn't understand.

Next, move any of the pieces that you find valuable over to the allergies page. Pretend you are making the allergies page. Group things together that you believe should be displayed together. Again, don't feel like you have to use all the pieces and use a post-it note to add any ideas.

# Wrap-up Questions - 5 minutes
- Pretend you developed a new medication allergy, such as a rash when you take penicillin. Would you add that medication allergy on the medication section and/or the allergy section of the questionnaire?
- How often do you expect to update each of these sections? Would you want to see these sections in a questionnaire before every VA appointment? Would you want to see these sections once every six months or some other time period?
- If we could only build one of these topics into a pre-visit questionnaire, which one would you prefer? Would you pick medications, allergies, and immunizations?
  - Why?
- Do you think adding these pages to a pre-visit questionnaire will help or not help you explain changes to your medications, allergies, and immunizations to your VA provider?
  - Why?
- Is there anything about medications, allergies, and immunizations that I should know about that I didn't cover today?
- Do you have any final questions for me?

## Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
