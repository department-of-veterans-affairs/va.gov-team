# Research Plan: Health Record (Medications, Allergies, and Immunizations), February 2021

## Goals	
This research is to explore:
  - problems Veterans face when communicating health record (medications, allergies, and immunizations) changes to their VA providers. 
  - how Veterans understand, group, and find value in reviewing and updating their medications, allergies, and immunizations within a health questionnaire prior to a primary care appointment.

**Background**<br/>
Our goal is to improve the in-person and online pre- and post-appointment experiences for Veterans, contribute to physical distancing efforts in VA facilities, and better integrate Veteran-provided data in VA workflows by providing Veterans with a digital option to complete pre- or post-appointment questionnaires and screeners. Our next phase will focus on improving the pre-appointment experience when visiting primary care providers by allowing Veterans to update their health record information, particuarly medications, allergies, and immunizations.

**Research questions**
- What current pain points do Veterans experience when communicating medications, allergies, and immunizations changes to their VA providers?
- What data and features do Veterans commonly grouped together when reviewing and updating their medications, allergies, and immunizations?
- Do Veterans understand various data points that could be displayed within medications, allergies, and immunizations?
- Do Veterans find value when reviewing and updating their medications, allergies, and immunizations? What do they find valuable?

**Hypothesis & assumptions**
- Adding the ability to view and update medications within the questionnaire help solve some of the Veteran's current pain points.
- Veterans will be confused by certain medication, allergy, and immunization information. This test should help identify commonly confusing items, so we can address that confusion.
- A pattern will emerge from the Veteran's groups, so the team will understand Veteran's mental model. This mental model could then be replicated in the workflow/interface.
- Veterans will find value in a subset, but probably not all possible data points and proposed features. This will help the team determine scope for this phase.

## Method	
We will conduct remote moderated test via Zoom using the Perigean contract. To start, the Veterans will be asked a series of interview questions to uncover current pain points and workflow. Then, participants will engage in a participatory design activity utilizing Mural. This activity should assist with:
- identifying confusing health record terms/data points.
- developing a mental model on how Veteran group health record information.
- identifying value of data points and proposed features.

## Participants and Recruitment

Recruit for 12 fulfilled sessions using the following criteria:

**Must have for participants**
- All participants must answer yes to all of the following questions:
  - Are you currently taking any prescribed medication?
  - Do you have any allergies or intolerances (such as dust mites, lactose intoleracet, or penicillin allergies)?
  - Have you had an immunization within the past two years (such as the flu shot)?
- At least one person must receive some of their medical care from providers outside of the VA
- At least one person who received their immunizations (such as flu shot) at a facility outside the VA, such as a non-VA provider office or a pharmacy
- At least one person with an identified cognitive consideration of PTSD or TBI

**Good to have for participants**
- At least 1 woman
- At least 1 person of color
- At least 1 participant 35 or under and 1 participant over 55
- At least one person that does not have a college degree (to include enlisted Vets)
- At least one person that has a college degree (to include of officer Vets)
- At least one person who lives in a rural or remote area
- At least one person who lives in a major metropolitan area
- At least one person with a disability rating of 70% or greater

**Recruitment requirements**
- All must have a laptop/desktop and be willing to be complete the test on said laptop/desktop
- The participants have Zoom downloaded prior to the session
- The participants know how to screenshare

*This study requires participants to screenshare, in order to click through a prototype. It will not be able to accommodate non-sighted users due to the prototype technology.*

## Timeline 	
#### Desired Timeline: Feb ?-?, 2021 
One hour sessions<br/>
**Schedule at least 15 minute breaks in-between sessions.**
