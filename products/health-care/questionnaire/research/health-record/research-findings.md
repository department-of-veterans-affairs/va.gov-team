## Background and Goals

### Background
Our goal is to improve the in-person and online pre- and post-appointment experiences for Veterans, contribute to physical distancing efforts in VA facilities, and better integrate Veteran-provided data in VA workflows by providing Veterans with a digital option to complete pre- or post-appointment questionnaires and screeners. 

Our next phase will focus on improving the pre-appointment experience when visiting providers by allowing Veterans to update their health record information, particularly medications, allergies, and immunizations.

### Research Goals
This research is to explore:
- problems Veterans face when communicating health record (medications, allergies, and immunizations) changes to their VA providers.
- how Veterans understand, group, and find value in reviewing and updating their medications, allergies, and immunizations within a health questionnaire prior to an appointment.
_But we really structured the test to broadly cover the topic of medications, allergies, and immunizations in the beginning. It was only toward the end that we brought up the idea of questionnaires._"

### Hypotheses to be tested
- Adding the ability to view and update medications, allergies, and immunizations within va.gov help solve some of the Veteran's current pain points.
- Veterans will be confused by certain medication, allergy, and immunization information. This test should help identify commonly confusing items, so we can address that confusion.
- A pattern will emerge from the Veteran's groupings, so the team will understand Veteran's mental model. This mental model could then be replicated in the workflow/interface.
- Veterans will find value in a subset, but probably not all possible data points and proposed features. This will help the team determine scope for this phase.

## Methodology

### Method
We conducted 7 remote moderated tests via Zoom using the Perigean contract. To start, the Veterans will be asked a series of interview questions to uncover current pain points and workflow. Then, participants will engage in a participatory design activity utilizing Mural. This activity should assist with:
- identifying confusing health record terms/data points.
- developing a mental model on how Veterans group health record information.
- identifying value of data points and proposed features.

### Who we spoke with: 7 Veterans
**Gender**
- Male: 3
- Female: 4

**Age**
- 25-34: 1
- 45-54: 1
- 55-64: 1
- 65-74: 4

**Education**
- Unknown: 1
- Associate’s degree/trade certificate/vocational training: 1
- Master’s degree: 3
- Doctorate degree: 2

- One participant was completely blind as well.

**In order to qualify for the study, all participants had to:**
- currently be taking at least one medication, 
- have at least one allergy, and
- have had an immunization within the past two years.

**We also specifically recruited for a portion of participants, who:**
- receive some medical care outsides of the VA (5 participants), and
  - Care outside the VA:
    - 5 participants saw the VA or community partners for most of their care. 
    - 1 participant sees the VA for 50% of their care
    - 1 participant didn’t go to the VA at all
- received their immunization at a facility outside the VA (3 participants).

### Research questions: Wrap-up
- How much of your medical care do you receive from the VA? (A great deal/All, Quite a bit, Somewhat, Very little, or None at all)
- How do you keep track of your medications, immunizations, and allergies?
  - What do you like about your current process?
  - What is frustrating about keeping track of your medications?
- How do you keep your VA providers up-to-date on your medications? For instance, maybe you stopped taking a medication or you were prescribed a new medication from a non-VA provider, how did you let your VA providers know?
  - How did the process of communicating those changes to the VA go?
  - If you take any supplements, vitamins, or over-the-counter medications, do you share that with your VA providers?
    - If yes, how did those experiences of letting your VA provider go? What methods did you utilize to communicate the change?
- Have you ever let your VA provider know about any changes to your allergy history?
  - If yes, how did those experiences of letting your VA provider go? What methods did you utilize to communicate the change?
- Have you ever received an immunization at a non-VA facility, maybe a non-VA provider's office or a pharmacy?
  - If yes, how did you let your VA provider know about those immunizations? How did those experiences of letting your VA provider go? What methods did you utilize to communicate the change?
- Do you get a flu shot every year? If so, where? If non-VA location, do they tell their VA provider? If not, why not?
- Have they gotten their COVID vaccine? If yes, was it at a VA facility? If no, are they planning on getting the vaccine and where do they plan on getting it?
  - If they got their COVID vaccine, how was their overall experience?
- _Only ask if necessary, depending upon how the Veteran answered the past three questions, if they didn't talk about their actual appointments with their providers._ How do you prepare for your appointment when you have changes you would like to discuss with your VA provider?
  - Observers: Take note if anyone mentions printing.
- Do you utilize MyHealtheVet?
  - If yes,
    - Have you ever checked your medication list on there?
    - Were those list easy or hard to understand? If hard, what did you find challenging?
    - Have you ever utilized secure message to notify your VA provider of medication, allergy, or immunization changes?
- How can we make it easier for you to communicate to your VA providers?

### Research questions: Mural activity
- This activity will help prioritize and group information that we could display online in medication, allergy, and immunization sections.
  - Observers: Take note of what pieces of data or features the Veteran doesn't understand. Also, note the reasons why the Veteran ranked and grouped things a certain way.
- Immunizations
  - I'm going to show you a bunch information that we could display on va.gov for immunizations. We are going to review them one-by-one. Let me know if you don't understand the item, then I'm going to have you rank them by how valuable they are to see displayed online.
  - Is there anything that should be added to immunizations that we didn't already review?
  - Now, let's group things together that you believe should be displayed together.
- Repeat for Medications and Allergies.

### Research questions: Wrap-up
- Pretend you developed a new medication allergy, such as a rash when you take penicillin. Would you add that medication allergy on the medication section and/or the allergy section?
- How often do you expect to update each of these sections? Would you want to see these sections in a questionnaire before every VA appointment? Would you want to see these sections once every six months or some other time period?
- If we could only build one of these topics into a pre-visit questionnaire, which one would you prefer? Would you pick medications, allergies, and immunizations? Why?
- Do you think adding these pages to a pre-visit questionnaire will help or not help you explain changes to your medications, allergies, and immunizations to your VA provider? Why?
- Is there anything about medications, allergies, and immunizations that I should know about that I didn't cover today?
- Do you have any final questions for me?

## Key Findings
- Veterans often need to communicate changes to their medication, allergy, and immunization record.
  - Veterans utilize a variety of methods to review and update their health records, including My HealtheVet, paper, phone calls, and in-person communication.
- Veterans sometimes don’t share or aren’t aware that certain updates to their medication, allergy, and immunization history would be helpful to VA providers.
- Reviewing and updating medication information is of great interest to Veterans.
- Needing to interact with or update allergies seems to occur less frequently than medications; however, the need can feel more urgent when it does arise.
- Reviewing and printing immunization records are useful, but updates aren’t urgent and tend to occur during appointments.
- The top three prioritized pieces of data or features for immunizations are immunization name (Flu shots, COVID-19), schedule an immunization, and date received. Immunizations also have four main mental model groupings for data/features: “what, when & where,” “next immunizations,” “product tracking,” and “how.”
- The top three prioritized pieces of data or features for medications are medication name and dose refills remaining, and directions (take with food). Medications also have four main mental model grouping for data/features: “when and what,” “things to pay attention to,” “providers,” and “tracking information.”
- The top three prioritized pieces of data or features for allergies are allergy name (Peanuts, Lactose intolerance), reactions (Rash, Anaphylaxis), and severity level (High risk, Low risk). Allergies also have three main mental model groupings for data/features: “what,” “actions,” and “when and where.”
- How often Veterans want to review and update this information varied from every appointment to annually.
- Some Veterans were pleasantly surprised that they would be empowered to propose  health record changes to their VA providers via a questionnaire or patient portal page. 
- Health questionnaires can expand the current ecosystem of Veteran-provider communications.

## Detailed Research Findings
### Veterans often need to communicate changes to their medication, allergy, and immunization record.
- Veteran quotes:
  - “We usually discuss that at my physical like the new prescriptions or if I’m taking the same thing.”
  - “I’ve had bad side effects from medications and [my VA providers] appreciate having that information.”
  - “I let them know when I plan to get [my flu shot].”
  - “With Ritalin, you have to talk to your doctor, because it isn’t renewable.”
- Every participant mentioned an experience of letting the VA know about a change to their medical record in these areas.

### Veterans utilize a variety of methods to review and update their health records, including My HealtheVet, paper, phone calls, and in-person communication.
- Current methods used across the Veteran's journey
  - My HealtheVet or Paper
    - Default methods of reviewing and planning their communications
    - For My HealtheVet users, secure messaging was described as the initial method utilized for questions or communicating changes
    - The Veterans utilizing MyHealtheVet and the Veterans utilizing paper to track changes to their medication, allergies, and immunizations were completely separate groups. Half of the Veterans mentioned utilizing MyHealtheVet. In particular, most mentioned utilizing secure messaging to manage questions and updates. However, the medication list on My HealtheVet was discussed as a resource.
  - Phone calls
    - Described as an escalation method to get questions answered or to communicate more urgent updates
  - In-person
    - Seen as the ultimate step in the process to provide updates or ask questions to their VA provider  

### Veterans sometimes don’t share or aren’t aware that certain updates to their medication, allergy, and immunization history would be helpful to VA providers.
- "“My doctor told me that I needed to start taking supplements, but it didn’t occur to me to provide them with details [about what I ended up taking].”
- “It didn’t think to add it to my record.” - speaking about an immunization they received during active duty that didn’t make it into their VA record.
- Half of the participants commented that they do not share or did not realize that certain information could be beneficial, such as supplements, over-the-counter medications, or immunizations received outside the VA.

### Reviewing and updating medication information is of great interest to Veterans.
- All participants had a current process by which they review their medications and communicate with their VA providers about:
  - stopping the usage of a medication
  - any side effects or reactions to a medication
  - medication record inaccuracies
  - questions they have about their medications
- When asked to choose between medications, allergies, and immunizations as the most important item for us to build within a pre-visit questionnaire, medications was chosen by **five out of seven** participants.
  - _One participant couldn’t decide between medications and allergies._

### Needing to interact with or update allergies seems to occur less frequently than medications; however, the need can feel more urgent when it does arise.
- Veteran quotes:
  - “I’ve always had [this allergy]. I had a bad reaction at 20 years old, so it is in all my medical records.”
  - “Allergies could be life saving for the individual.”
  - “Allergies...are the most significant things that happen that are not always remembered at the appointment.”
- When asked to choose between medications, allergies, and immunizations as the most important item for us to build within a pre-visit questionnaire, allergies was chosen by **three out of seven** participants.
  - _One participant couldn’t decide between medications and allergies._
  - _One participant couldn’t decide between immunizations and allergies._

### Reviewing and printing immunization records are useful, but updates aren’t urgent and tend to occur during appointments.
- One participant recently went back to college utilizing the GI Bill. As a result, getting access to a print out of their official immunization record was extremely important.
  - Due to the GI Bill and higher education institutions’ immunization record entrance requirements, printing an immunization record could be very beneficial to Veterans enrolling in college and universities. 
- Six out of seven participants mentioned updating their providers about their immunizations. Most stated that they waited until their appointment.
- During their descriptions, there wasn’t this sense of urgency around getting update to their medical provider. The immunization mentioned most often as something they needed to let their provider know that they received was the flu shot.

### Immunizations Prioritization
1. Immunization name (Flu shots, COVID-19)
2. Schedule an immunization
3. Date received
4. Reminder that immunization is due
5. Printing immunization record
___________
6.	Add an immunization
7.	1st dose vs. 2nd dose
8.	Product name/manufacturer
9.	Health care professional or clinic site
10.	Recommended screenings and immunizations
11.	Reactions
12.	Editing reactions
13. Comment box
14.	CDC Traveler’s Health Information (link)
15.	By mouth, inhalant, injection
16.	Lot number
17.	Location of immunization (arm)

- Items above of the line averaged within the very important or important categories and had lower standard deviation scores. 
- A few participants stated that they were ranking product name/manufacturer and lot number higher due to COVID, then they would based upon other immunizations. Now 1st dose and 2nd dose (which could have been associated with COVID) was pretty consistent, because some other immunizations require more than one dose (such as Shingles). 
- Participants did mention a preference to show the common names of immunizations, such as flu shot compared to influenza. There was slight confusions on what “Editing reactions” actually let you do. However, most participants understood all pieces of data/features without explanation. As a whole, confusion was pretty low for all items within immunizations, medications, and allergies, which is not what the team was expecting prior to testing.
- Secure messaging was mentioned by multiple participants as a feature that should be added to this list. The participants who suggested it also ranked it very highly. How long does each immunization last (like flu shot is 1 year and tetanus is every 10) was suggested as an item by one participant. 

### Immunization Groupings
_Activity completed by 6 participants._
**What, when & where**
- Immunization name
- Date received
- Health care professional or clinic name

**Next immunizations**
- Reminder that immunization is due
- Schedule an immunization

**Product tracking**
- Product name / manufacturer
- Lot number

**How**
- Location of immunization
- By mouth, inhalant, injection

**Notes:**
- Minimum of half the participants grouped these items together in order to them to appear in the above groupings.
- What Veterans really wanted for “Reminder that immunization is due” were recommendations that took their medical records into account. For instance, we see that you are turning 60, so you should now get the Shingles vaccine. Currently on MyHealtheVet, it is just a link to a page of content about recommendations that aren’t tailor to the Veteran specifically.

### Medications Prioritization
1. Medication name and dose
2. Refills remaining
3. Directions (Take with food)
4. Warnings/Interactions
5. Quantity 
6. Duration
7. Last refilled on
8. Add a medication
9. Your own side effects 
_________
10.	Prescribed by (Doctor’s name)
11. Expires on
12.	Rx #
13.	Ordered on
14. Discontinued, active, expired
15.	VA vs. Non-VA prescription
16.	Pharmacy information
17.	Side effects
18.	Patient education link
19.	Comment box
20.	Taking as prescribed (Yes/No and Why?)
21.	Injection, Oral, Liquid
22.	Description (Oval, white)

- Items to the left of the line averaged within the very important or important categories and had lower standard deviation scores. 
- Secure messaging and Diagnosis (What do I take this medication for?) were mentioned by multiple participants as features that should be added to this list. The participants who suggested these also ranked them very highly.
- There was no real confusion with any of these pieces of data/features. With later participants in the study, we asked if they would rank the “Taking as prescribed (Yes/No and Why?)” if it was just no. Participants stated that they probably would rank it higher. An example a participants shared about why they see that as value was to let a provider know if a medication was upsetting their stomach. 
- Five out of seven participants want to list medication allergies (such as you develop a rash when taking Penicillin) in both the medications and allergies sections.

### Medications Groupings
_Activity completed by 6 participants._
**When and what**
- Medication name and dose
- Directions (Take with food)
  - Sub-group 1
    - Refills remaining
    - Last refilled on
  - Sub-group 2
    - Quantity
    - Duration
    - Diagnosis
  - Sub-group 3
    - Expires on
    - Ordered on

**Things to pay attention to**
- Side effects
- Warnings / Interactions
- Directions (Take with food)

**Providers**
- VA/Non-VA prescription
- Pharmacy information
- Prescribed by

**Tracking information**
- Medication name and dose
- Rx #

**Notes:**
- Minimum of half the participants grouped these items together in order for them to appear in the above groupings.
- There was much more overlap in the groupings within medications then allergies and immunizations. 

### Allergies Prioritization
1. Allergy name (Peanuts, Lactose intolerance)
2. Reactions (Rash, Anaphylaxis)
3. Severity level (High risk, low risk)
4. Add an allergy
5. Editing reactions
__________
6.	Comment box
7.	Onset date
8.	Patient education link (Medline plus)
9.	Verified date (and not verified)
10.	Documenting facility
11.	Diagnosed (Yes/No)
12.	Reported by (Doctor’s name, Veteran)

- Items to the left of the line averaged within the very important or important categories and had lower standard deviation scores. Treatment plan for allergy (such as an Epipen, allergy shots, antihistamines) was added to the list by one participant. Participants commented on wanting to utilize the comment box like a quick secure message.
- Veterans were confused about the difference between verified date and diagnosed (yes/no). Most said that they wouldn’t need diagnosed (yes/no) if they had a verified date.
- Five out of seven participants want to list medication allergies (such as you develop a rash when taking Penicillin) in both the medications and allergies sections.

### Allergies Groupings
_Activity completed by 6 participants._
**What**
- Allergy name
- Reaction
- Severity level
- _There was more of a correlation shown for grouping allergy name, reactions, and severity level compared to the other groupings._

**Actions**
- Add an allergy
- Editing reactions
- Comment box

**When and where**
- Verified date
- Documenting facility
- Onset date
- Reported by

### How often Veterans want to review and update this information varied from every appointment to annually.
- All participant responses
  - every 6 months
  - only major appointments like physicals, but not sick visits
  - once a month to every few months
  - every two-three months
  - annually
  - before each appointment
  - based on appointment types and what could impact that appointment, so definitely before all physicals and procedures (like colonoscopies).

### Some Veterans were pleasantly surprised that they would be empowered to propose health record changes to their VA providers via a questionnaire or patient portal page.
- Veterans’ surprise really centered around this empowerment. While some Veterans immediately accepted this ability, others needed reassurance that they were allowed to submit these changes. A few participants wondered if they would/should be required to send supporting documentation when submitting changes to their health record. The research team reassured some participants that providers would be reviewing all submissions sent via questionnaire or patient portal page before actually changing their health record. 
- Interestingly, Veterans currently have this ability via My HealtheVet, phone, secure messaging, and in-person communications. Out of all the current methods, many participants discussed their comfort with utilizing secure messaging as the digital solution to share this information. Secure messaging was mentioned multiple times throughout this study. It is definitely seen as a current way to communicate changes with their provider.
- We aren’t completely sure why participant reactions varied by method of communication (secure messaging versus questionnaire/patient portal page). Ultimately, patient reactions were really more of a pleasant awe compared to concern when discussing questionnaires and patient portal pages. They saw it as a good thing that they would be able to take this much control of their health.
- Except for one participant who saw this data entry via a questionnaire or patient portal page as their provider’s job and not theirs.

### Health questionnaires can expand the current ecosystem of Veteran-provider communications.
- Veterans ranked “making changes to their health record” low during the prioritization activity, but their verbal explanations highlighted how ubiquitous communicating health record changes are to Veterans.
- **New hypothesis:** Current communication methods are already helping Veterans share health records changes with their providers, but health questionnaires can expand the ecosystem in unique ways (shown on next slide):
  - Giving Veterans time to reflect on their answers from the comfort of their home
    - Veteran quote: “I can update it at night when I have the resources. There’s nothing worse than being [at the doctor’s office] and not having the [medication] bottle with me.”
      - This quote highlights a current pain point of not having time to clearly time think through health record updates while in the waiting room or during their appointment. 
  - Utilizing text and email notifications to trigger Veterans to review and update these items
    - One participant asked (before even knowing about health questionnaires) to receive a notification triggering them to review and update these items before an appointment.
  - Eliminating confusion on what updates would be beneficial to providers by asking targeted questions within the questionnaires 
  - When explicitly asked after health questionnaires were explained in more detail, all participants stated that they saw value to including medications, allergies, and immunizations with a health questionnaire.

## Recommendations and Next Steps
- Move toward with the idea of allowing Veterans to review and update their medication, allergy, and immunization information in digital health questionnaires.
  - Take Veteran’s priority order of medications, allergies, then immunizations into account with continued work.
  - Look further into communicating COVID immunization updates (particularly if a Veteran received the COVID vaccine outside the VA) and its priority compared to medications. 
    - Very few of our participants already received their COVID vaccine.
- Utilize the prioritization and grouping information to explore health questionnaire designs that include medications, allergies, and immunizations. Then, retest to make sure the actual solution meet Veterans needs.
- Make sure that our solution reduces the burden of reviewing these sections too often, since Veterans needs and preferences greatly vary.
- Validate and compare VA provider pain points around medications, allergies, and immunizations to Veteran feedback.
