## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes ##
_Participant answers in bold._

- For pre-COVID participants. Can you tell me about the last time that you saw your primary care provider at the VA?
    - What was the experience prior to the appointment like? For example, did you have to fill out any forms before the appointment? Did the nurse ask you a lot of questions?
- For post-COVID participants. Think about your last primary care provider visit at the VA. Did your appointment experience change at all post-COVID?
      - If so, how?
      - Did the length of your appointment feel any different (shorter or longer)?
      - What was the experience prior to the appointment like? For example, did you have to fill out any forms before the appointment? Did the nurse ask you a lot of questions?
      - **The appointment itself was about the same, as was the number of people I interacted with. Overall there were fewer people in the facility and the chairs were spaced out more than usual. The appointment process was the same, other than the COVID screenings and questions. 
I also went to a community orthopedic doctor 3 times. The main difference is that I had to sit in my car to fill out the forms.**

## Usability Task: Complete the questionnaire - 10 minutes ##
Keep that pre-appointment experience in mind as I tell you about our first exercise. I will give you a task and ask you to "narrate" your thoughts as you complete the task.<br/>
I'm going to send you a link in the chat.<br/>

[Desktop Prototype](https://preview.uxpin.com/e9e0dc597bb076e74db05f77d35306496a89fca2#/pages//simulate/no-panels?mode=cvhidm)<br/>

Task: Pretend that you (your name in the prototype will be Hector Allen) just scheduled your annual physical exam with your primary care provider. To allow your care team to better meet your needs at the appointment, they are requesting you fill out a previsit questionnaire. Complete this questionnaire.<br/>
_Guide the user to fill in no more than two questions on the Prepare for Your Appointment page. Only give additional direction if the Veteran gets stuck completing the task._
- **_looked over the entire main screen_ I’d expect to be able to type more in the text fields, even though some of the info has already been generated. _minor issue with keyboard availability while sharing screen through Zoom – unable to access the full keyboard_**

## Reviewing Screens in More Detail - 25 minutes (total for all pages) ##
Great, thank you for doing that exercise. Next, we are going to go back to the beginning of the questionnaire, so I can ask more questions about each page.<br/>
_Help them navigate back to the introduction page by clicking the header of the confirmation page._

### On the Introduction page - 10 minutes ###
- _Ask if the Veteran didn't review the entire page during the Usability Task._ I saw that you immediately clicked the sign in button during the first activity. Take some time now and review the rest of the page.
- What are your impressions of this page?
  - **This page seems like a typical webpage. My only concern, having done these types if questionnaires in the past, is that the nurse or doctor may not have read/retained what you entered in the form. That’s the only potential downside.**
- Review the "How will my personal health information be protected and shared if I use this questionnaire?" question.
  - What are your thoughts about the information provided?
  - Is it what you were expecting or not expecting?
    - **I’d expect the information I enter here to be sent to all necessary/relevant people.**
- Review the steps information. (Explain if necessary where the steps are.)
  - What are your thoughts about the information provided?
- In what order would you display the emergency, sharing, and steps information?
- Is there any other information we should include here?

### On the Veteran Information page - 2 minutes ###
- Do you feel that VA.gov typically has the correct demographic information for you? 
  - **A profile section would be best.**
- Do you find yourself updating contact information at primary care visits often?

### On the This Visit page - 7 minutes ###
_Tell the Veteran before asking questions on this page._ This is the first version of these questions. We plan to expand this form, so you could review your mediations, allergies, medical conditions, and more prior to an appointment.<br/>
- What are your impressions of this page?
  - **It appears to be very straight forward. It’s nice that you can add as much information as you wish.** 
- Do you see value or no value in sharing this information with your primary care provider?
  - **I see a lot of value in having that info there.**
- How would you expect your doctor or primary care provider to use this information?
  - **For renewing prescriptions or rethinking through care strategies. It would help them be better prepared. It would also help streamline the process on the doctor’s end.**
- Do you feel the in-person part of your appointment with the doctor/nurse will be different after providing this information ahead of time?
- _If they didn't edit the "additional details" field,_ why didn't you edit the additional details question?
- _If not explicitly mentioned,_ if you have a lot of questions for your visit, do you think ranking the questions here would help get your most important questions answered first?
  - **Yes, it would also help speed up the process of next steps.**
- Should your questionnaire answers automatically appear in your next upcoming appointment questionnaire as a reminder of what you wanted to discuss/discussed with your provider, then you can make edits? Do you think the information that you enter for these questions will differ drastically each time, so it isn't worth transferring that information to the new questionnaire?
  - **I’d like to think that there is no need to transfer it over. The best thing would be to just give the veteran the option to import from a previous questionnaire at the beginning.**

### On the Review page - 2 minutes (Optional) ###
- What are your impressions of this page?
  - **It’s a good review – standard page.**

### On the Confirmation page - 4 minutes ###
- What are your impressions of this page?
  - **I’d like there to be a print option on this confirmation page.**
- Once you submit this questionnaire, who do you expect will have access to the answers that you entered? - Is it what you were expecting or not expecting?
- Is there any other information we should include here?
- Where would you like to navigate to next after completing this form? (You can select more than one or none of the following options.)
  - A list of your upcoming appointments**
  - **A list of other questionnaires that you need to complete – it should be explicitly stated that there are multiple questionnaires to be completed**
  - VA.gov home page
  - Other:

## Follow-up Questions - 5 minutes ##
- Where on va.gov would you expect all of your healthcare questionnaires to live?
  - Within a "Manage your healthcare benefits" section
  - Within a "More healthcare resources" section
  - Within a "VA healthcare appointments" section
  - On the va.gov homepage
  - Other:
- When would you fill out this questionnaire?
  - The day before my appointment
  - 2-3 days before my appointment
  - A week before my appointment
  - 2-3 weeks before my appointment
  - A month before my appointment
  - Other: **10 days in advance would give them a chance to be ready by the time of the appointment. I would expect them to look at this at the time that I fill it out to being planning our next steps. This would be especially helpful for planning additional things that need to be done, such as X-Rays. Although, I know doctors are busy so maybe the nurse could help out with this process.**
- How would you have liked to receive a notification that you had this questionnaire to complete? (You can select more than one or none of the following options.)
  - **text message**
  - **email**
  - just visiting VA.gov and seeing it on the website.
  - Other:
- Are there any topics or questions you'd like to see that weren't included in today's exercise?
- Do you have any questions for me?
