# Research Plan for Usability Testing the MVP Upcoming Appointment Questionnaire October 2020 

## Goals	
This research is to usability test a mobile and desktop version of the upcoming appointment questionnaire design and gain feedback on the content/wording within the questionnaire. 

**Background**<br/>
Our goal is to improve the in-person and online pre- and post-appointment experiences for Veterans, contribute to physical distancing efforts in VA facilities, and better integrate Veteran-provided data in VA workflows by providing Veterans with a digital option to complete pre- or post-appointment questionnaires and screeners. Our MVP will focus on improving the pre-appointment experience when visiting primary care providers.

**Research questions**
- Are Veterans able to successfully complete the questionnaire?
- Is there any confusion caused by the content or question wording within the questionnaire?

**Hypothesis & assumptions**
- Veterans will be able to successfully complete the questionnaire.
- There will be minimal confusion created by the content and question wording within the questionnaire. 

## Method	
We will conduct remote moderated usability testing via Zoom using the Perigean contract. This method will allow us to share a high-fidelity wireframe prototype (mobile and desktop versions) to confirm if our questionnaire is easily usable by Veterans.

## Participants and Recruitment

Recruit for 12 fulfilled sessions (6 for the desktop version and 6 for the mobile version of the test) using the following criteria:

**Must have for participants**
- Have you visted a primary care provider at the VA in the last year? (pass = yes)
	- If confused by the term "primary care provider," explain that a primary care provider is your main doctor, nurse practitioner, or physicianâ€™s assistant.
	- _If primary care appointments are too difficult to recruit for, then expand to having any medical appointment type within the last year._
- At least four participants who had an appointment, since COVID began (mid-March 2020).
	- One of the four must be a virtual visit.

**Good to have for participants**
- At least one iOS mobile device owner
- At least one Android mobile device owner
- At least 1 woman
- At least 1 person of color
- At least 1 participant 35 or under and 1 participant over 55
- At least one person that does not have a college degree (to include enlisted Vets)
- At least one person that has a college degree (to include of officer Vets)
- At least one person who lives in a rural or remote area
- At least one person who lives in a major metropolitan area
- At least one person with a disability rating of 70% or greater
- At least one person with an identified cognitive consideration of PTSD or TBI

**Recruitment requirements**
- Half (6) must have a mobile device and be willing to be complete the test on said device
- Half (6) must have a laptop/desktop and be willing to be complete the test on said laptop/desktop
- The participants have Zoom downloaded prior to the session
- The participants know how to screenshare

*This study requires participants to screenshare, in order to click through a prototype. It will not be able to accommodate non-sighted users due to the prototype technology.*
