# Research Plan for Usability Testing the MVP Upcoming Appointment Questionnaire October 2020 

_Amanda - Preference on a desktop or mobile test? As a program, we are pushing mobile first. We may not be able to see where someone specifically clicks when using the Zoom app, but that is really the only downside (and makig sure people download Zoom)._

## Goals	
This research is to usability test the proposed design of the upcoming appointment questionnaire and gain feedback on the content/wording within the questionnaire. It will also gather initial feedback on a page that will list all questionnnaires for a Veteran. 

**Background**<br>
Our goal is to improve the in-person and online pre- and post-appointment experiences for Veterans, contribute to physical distancing efforts in VA facilities, and better integrate Veteran-provided data in VA workflows by providing Veterans with a digital option to complete pre- or post-appointment questionnaires and screeners. Our MVP will focus on improving the pre-appointment experience when visiting primary care providers.

**Research questions**
- Are Veterans able to successfully complete the questionnaire?
- Is there any confusion caused by the content or question wording within the questionnaire?
- Are Veteran interested in sharing other information with their provider or seeeing other content that the questionnaire currently doesn't include?
- Do Veterans understand the purpose of the Questionnaire Manager page?

**Hypothesis & assumptions**
- Veterans will be able to successfully complete the questionnaire.
- There will be minimal confusion created by the content and question wording within the questionnaire. 
- Veterans will provide feedback on additional topics/questions not shown in the current questionnaire.
- Veterans will understand the purpose of the Questionnaire Manager page.


## Method	
We will conduct remote moderated usability testing via Zoom using the Perigean contract. This method will allow us to share a high-fidelity wireframe prototype to confirm if our questionnaire is easily usable by Veterans. We will also gather feedback on ways to expand our MVP questionnaire scope.

## Participants and Recruitment	

Recruit for 8 fulfilled sessions using the following criteria:

**Must have for participants**
- Have you visted a primary care provider at the VA in the last year? (pass = yes)
	- If confused by the term "primary care provider," explain that a primary care provider is your main doctor, nurse practitioner, or physicianâ€™s assistant.

**Good to have for participants**
- At least 1 woman
- At least 1 person of color
- At least 1 participant 35 or under and 1 participant over 55
- At least one person that does not have a college degree (to include enlisted Vets)
- At least one person that has a college degree (to include of officer Vets)
- At least one person who lives in a rural or remote area
- At least one person who lives in a major metropolitan area
- At least one person with a disability rating of 70% or greater

**Recruitment requirements**
- The participants have Zoom downloaded prior to the session
- The participants know how to screenshare

*This study requires participants to screenshare, in order to click through a prototype.*

## Timeline 	
#### Desired Timeline: October ?-?, 2020 
_Amanda - what is our desired timeline? If I finalize the research plan and conversation guide this week, then try to get the prototype done by mid-next week (at the lastest). Shawna said to send it to her first and give her a day for feedback. Then, I might want a day to make changes, but I can schedule the VSP review when I send it off to Shawna, but they book 2-3 days out. Fingers crossed that we can get the VSP review done by the 9th. Right after VSP review, I can send everything to Lauren for review and recruiting. Recruiting takes a week. So my estimation is starting Oct. 15- 16th (if everything goes quickly), but probably Oct. 19th is more likely. Thoughts?_
