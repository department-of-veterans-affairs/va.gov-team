## Project-specific setup and Intro - 10 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Kristen and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to review a prototype of a questionnaire that will help you and your doctor prepare for an upcoming appointment.

**If desktop participant**

- **Since this is a prototype, not everything will be clickable or fully functioning.**
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve our tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **This entire session should take about an hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- Talk them through Zoom screen sharing and chat features shown in document.
- [Screen share and walk through this document if necessary](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lo44N4rTBDaHfcsjX6bCV1a--YJSTPXSXnZbywB71J0/edit?usp=sharing)


**If mobile participant**

- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve our tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **This entire session should take about an hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- First I want to make sure your technology is ready to go for this session. Can you confirm for me what type of device you're using to join today?
    -Great, that helps me troubleshoot with you if we run into any problems.
    
_For iPhone:_
- OK great. When you are inside the zoom application on your phone, you'll see a few buttons at the bottom. Audio, Video, Share content, Participants, and three dots over to the right. If you tap on those dots, you'll also see a function called "Chat". If you don't tap the screen for a while, the icons at the bottom will hide. You can tap anywhere on the screen to get them to show. The ones that will be important for us today are "chat" and "share content." Any questions?
- Tap ‘Share content’ (Green button at bottom middle of the screen)
- Tap on Screen
- Tap Zoom
- Tap start broadcast. After a count of 3, the entire device screen will be shared into the meeting
- Tap the red bar at the top of your screen when you are ready to end the share
- Great, now I can see your phone screen! I'm going to begin now if that's ok with you. We will return to this in a few moments.
_For troubleshooting screen sharing in iOS, reference the Zoom documentation here https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115005890803-iOS-Screen-Sharing_

_For Android:_
- OK great. When you are inside the zoom application on your phone, you'll see a few buttons at the bottom. For instance, Share and three dots over to the right. If you tap on those dots, you'll also see a function called "Chat". If you don't tap the screen for a while, the icons at the bottom will hide. You can tap anywhere on the screen to get them to show. The ones that will be important for us today are "chat" and "share." Any questions?
- Tap "Share"
- Tap "Screen"
- May give a "sensitive info" alert
- May ask you to give Zoom permission to display over other apps, toggle yes. The hit the back arrow . Then it might just share your screen.
- Tap "Start now" (maybe)

**Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:**

- Ok, it seems like we're having some trouble getting the prototype up on your screen. I'm really excited for you to participate though, so what we're going to do today is have me share my screen, and then I'm going to have you "Drive". You will tell me what to do, what to tap, on, etc. Does that sound ok?
- [Share your screen]. Can you confirm if you can see my screen?

**Recording Instructions**

- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?"** 

Great. Now we're really ready to begin!

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

- _For pre-COVID participants._ Can you tell me about the last time that you saw your primary care provider at the VA?
    - What was the experience prior to the appointment like? For example, did you have to fill out any forms before the appointment? Did the nurse ask you a lot of questions?
    - How does this compare to any non-VA providers that you see?
- _For post-COVID participants._ Think about your last primary care provider visit at the VA. Did your appointment experience change at all post-COVID?
    - If so, how?
    - Did the length of your appointment feel any different (shorter or longer)?
    - What was the experience prior to the appointment like? For example, did you have to fill out any forms before the appointment? Did the nurse ask you a lot of questions?
    - How does this compare to any non-VA providers that you see?

## Usability Task: Complete the questionnaire - 10 minutes

Keep that pre-appointment experience in mind as I tell you about our first exercise. I will give you a task and ask you to "narrate" your thoughts as you complete the task. 

I'm going to send you a link in the chat.

[Mobile Prototype](https://preview.uxpin.com/a15205c1bedcdfc8fe46fed26c22fa731cab8ae0cvhidm)<br/>
[Desktop Prototype](https://preview.uxpin.com/e9e0dc597bb076e74db05f77d35306496a89fca2cvhidm)

**Task: Pretend that you (your name in the prototype will be Hector Allen) just scheduled your annual physical exam with your primary care provider. When you booked it with the call center, you told them that you were having pain in your right knee. To allow your care team to better meet your needs at the appointment, they are requesting you fill out a previsit questionnaire. Complete this questionnaire. Fill it out like you would be filling out a for first form.**

_Guide the user to fill in no more than two questions on the Prepare for Your Appointment page._
_Only give additional direction if the Veteran gets stuck completing the task._<br/>

### Things to watch/listen for:

- _Did the Veteran successfully completed the task. Success = getting to the screen with the "Your questionnaire has been sent to your provider." alert box._
- _Did the Veteran immediately click the sign in button on the introduction page or did they take time to review the introduction page?_
- _Pay attention to Veteran commentary on confusing or pleasing portions of the questionnaire._
- _Take note of anything the Veteran suggests to add._


## Reviewing Screens in More Detail - 25 minutes (total for all pages)

Great, thank you for doing that exercise. Next, we are going to go back to the beginning of the questionnaire, so I can ask more questions about each page.<br/>
_Help them navigate back to the introduction page by clicking the header of the confirmation page._

### On the Introduction page - 10 minutes
- _Ask if the Veteran didn't review the entire page during the Usability Task._ I saw that you immediately clicked the sign in button during the first activity. Take some time now and review the rest of the page.
- What are your impressions of this page?
- What are your thoughts about the information provided?
    - Is it what you were expecting or not expecting?
        - in "How will VA protect..."?
        - in the blue box (don't use for emergencies)?
        - in "What happens after I answer..."?
- Is there any other information we should include here?

### On the Veteran Information page - 2 minutes
- Do you feel that VA.gov typically has the correct demographic information for you?
- Have you ever updated your contact information?
    - If so, can you tell me about the process? Where did you update it? How did it go?
- If updating online, would you want to update it in this questionnaire or within a profile section?

### On the This Visit page - 7 minutes
_Tell the Veteran before asking questions on this page._ This is the first version of these questions. We plan to expand this form, so you could review your mediations, allergies, medical conditions, and more prior to an appointment.
- What are your impressions of this page?
- Do you see value or no value in sharing this information with your primary care provider?
- How would you expect your doctor or primary care provider to use this information?
- Do you feel the in-person part of your appointment with the doctor/nurse will be different after providing this information ahead of time?
- _If they didn't edit the "additional details" field,_ why didn't you edit the additional details question?
- _If not explicitly mentioned,_ if you have a lot of questions for your visit, do you think ranking the questions here would help get your most important questions answered first?
- Should your questionnaire answers automatically appear in your next upcoming appointment questionnaire as a reminder of what you wanted to discuss/discussed with your provider, then you can make edits? Do you think the information that you enter for these questions will differ drastically each time, so it isn't worth transferring that information to the new questionnaire?

### On the Review page - 2 minutes (Optional)
- What are your impressions of this page?

### On the Confirmation page - 4 minutes
- What are your impressions of this page?
- Once you submit this questionnaire, who do you expect will have access to the answers that you entered?
        - Is it what you were expecting or not expecting?
- Is there any other information we should include here? Anything about what to bring to your appointment or how to contact?
- Where would you like to navigate to next after completing this form? (You can select more than one or none of the following options.)
_Pause to let them answer, then provide options._
    - A list of your upcoming appointments
    - A list of other questionnaires that you need to complete
    - VA.gov home page
    - Other:

## Follow-up Questions - 5 minutes

_Pause to let them answer, then provide options._
    - Within a "Manage your healthcare benefits" section
    - Within a "More healthcare resources" section
    - Within a "VA healthcare appointments" section
    - On the va.gov homepage
    - Other:

- When would you fill out this questionnaire?
_Pause to let them answer, then provide options._
    - The day before my appointment
    - 2-3 days before my appointment
    - A week before my appointment
    - 2-3 weeks before my appointment
    - A month before my appointment
    - Other:

_Pause to let them answer, then provide options._
    - text message
