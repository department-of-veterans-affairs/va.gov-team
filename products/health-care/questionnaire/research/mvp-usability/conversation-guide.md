# Conversation Guide for Upcoming Appointment Questionnaire MVP Usability Testing

## Session Setup/Logistics

_Make sure everyone except the participant and moderator are on mute._
_Make sure they are on the desktop version (unless we decide to do a mobile test)._
_When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro._

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Kristen and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to review a prototype of a questionnaire that will help you and your doctor prepare for an upcoming appointment.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **Since this is a prototype, not everything will be clickable or fully functioning.**
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve our tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **This entire session should take about an hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?"** 

## Usability Task: Complete the questionnaire - 10 minutes

Before we begin, I want to give you some context for our first exercise. I will give you a task and ask you to "narrate" your thoughts as you complete the task. 

I'm going to send you a link in the chat. Once you pull up the link, will you share your screen with me?

[Prototype LINK TBD](TBD)

**Task: Pretend that you just made an appointment and received a link to this questionnaire via text or email. Complete this questionnaire.**

_Only give additional direction if the Veteran gets stuck completing the task._

- After completing the task, would you say it was easy or difficult to complete this questionnaire?
    - Why?

### Things to watch/listen for:

- _Did the Veteran successfully completed the task. Success = getting to the screen with the "Your questionnaire has been sent to your provider." alert box._
- _Pay attention to Veteran commentary on confusing or pleasing portions of the questionnaire._
- _Take note of anything the Veteran suggests to add._


## Reviewing Screens in More Detail - 26 minutes (total for all pages)

Great, thank you for doing that exercise. Next, we are going to go back to the beginning of the questionnaire, so I can ask more questions about each page.
_Help them navigate back to the introduction page._

### On the Introduction page - 7 minutes

    - What are your thoughts about the information provided? 
    - Is it what you were expecting or not expecting?
- In what order would you display the emergency, sharing, and steps information?
- Is there any other information we should include here?

### On the Veteran Information page - 3 minutes

## Questionnaire Manager Page Review - 7 minutes

Direct the Veteran to navigate the prototype to the Questionnaire Manager page.

    - What does this mean? (Asking about statuses if it wasn't addressed in the first question.)
- What do you expect to happen if you clicked on Medications?
- How useful would a page like this be for you?
    - Why would you access a completed questionnaire?
 

## Follow-up Questions - 5 minutes

- Are there any topics or questions you'd like to see that weren't included in today's exercise?
- Do you have any questions for me?
- _Are there any other questions about Q4 work that we want to ask about? Questions to get at the IA placement of the form?_

## Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
