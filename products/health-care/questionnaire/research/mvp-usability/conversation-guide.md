# Conversation Guide for Upcoming Appointment Questionnaire MVP Usability Testing

## Session Setup/Logistics

- _Make sure everyone except the participant and moderator are on mute._
- _If participating in desktop version, make sure they are on the Zoom desktop version and ready to screenshare._
- _If participanting in mobile version, make sure they are setup on Zoom app and ready to screenshare._
- _When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro._

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Kristen and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to review a prototype of a questionnaire that will help you and your doctor prepare for an upcoming appointment.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **Since this is a prototype, not everything will be clickable or fully functioning.**
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve our tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes to an hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?"** 

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

- _For pre-COVID participants._ Can you tell me about the last time that you saw your primary care provider at the VA?
    - What was the experience prior to the appointment like? For example, did you have to fill out any forms before the appointment? Did the nurse ask you a lot of questions?
- _For post-COVID participants._ Think about your last primary care provider visit at the VA. Did your appointment experience change at all post-COVID?
    - If so, how?
    - Did the length of your appointment feel any different (shorter or longer)?
    - What was the experience prior to the appointment like? For example, did you have to fill out any forms before the appointment? Did the nurse ask you a lot of questions?

## Usability Task: Complete the questionnaire - 10 minutes

Keep that pre-appointment experience in mind as I tell you about our first exercise. I will give you a task and ask you to "narrate" your thoughts as you complete the task. 

I'm going to send you a link in the chat. Once you pull up the link, will you share your screen with me?

[Mobile Prototype](https://preview.uxpin.com/a15205c1bedcdfc8fe46fed26c22fa731cab8ae0cvhidm)<br/>
[Desktop Prototype](https://preview.uxpin.com/e9e0dc597bb076e74db05f77d35306496a89fca2cvhidm)

**Task: Pretend that you (your name in the prototype will be William Nelson) just scheduled your annual physical exam with your primary care provider. To allow your care team to better meet your needs at the appointment, they are requesting you fill out a previsit questionnaire. Complete this questionnaire.**

_Guide the user to fill in no more than two questions on the Prepare for Your Appointment page._
_Only give additional direction if the Veteran gets stuck completing the task._<br/>

### Things to watch/listen for:

- _Did the Veteran successfully completed the task. Success = getting to the screen with the "Your questionnaire has been sent to your provider." alert box._
- _Did the Veteran immediately click the sign in button on the introduction page or did they take time to review the introduction page?_
- _Pay attention to Veteran commentary on confusing or pleasing portions of the questionnaire._
- _Take note of anything the Veteran suggests to add._


## Reviewing Screens in More Detail - 25 minutes (total for all pages)

Great, thank you for doing that exercise. Next, we are going to go back to the beginning of the questionnaire, so I can ask more questions about each page.<br/>
_Help them navigate back to the introduction page._

### On the Introduction page - 10 minutes
- _Ask if the Veteran didn't review the entire page during the Usability Task._ I saw that you immediately clicked the sign in button during the first activity. Take some time now and review the rest of the page.
- What are your impressions of this page?
- Review the "How will my personal health information be protected and shared if I use this questionnaire?" question. 
    - What are your thoughts about the information provided?
    - Is it what you were expecting or not expecting?
- Review the steps information. (_Explain if necessary where the steps are._)
    - What are your thoughts about the information provided?
- In what order would you display the emergency, sharing, and steps information?
- Is there any other information we should include here?

### On the Veteran Information page - 2 minutes
- Do you feel that VA.gov typically has the correct demographic information for you?
- Do you find yourself updating contact information at primary care visits often?

### On the This Visit page - 7 minutes
_Tell the Veteran before asking questions on this page._ This is the first version of these questions. We plan to expand this form, so you could review your mediations, allergies, medical conditions, and more prior to an appointment.
- What are your impressions of this page?
- Do you see value or no value in sharing this information with your primary care provider?
- How would you expect your doctor or primary care provider to use this information?
- Do you feel the in-person part of your appointment with the doctor/nurse will be different after providing this information ahead of time?
- _If not explicitly mentioned,_ what do you think about ranking the questions that you enter?
- Should your questionnaire answers automatically appear in your next upcoming appointment questionnaire, so you can review and edit. Do you think the information that you enter for these questions will be very different each time?

## Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
