### Jobs Statement
When going to a healthcare visit, I want to share my current health status and medical history so that my information can influence and be used to create my treatement plan accross the coninium of care. 

	- When < situation> I want to < Motivation > so that < Expected outcome

### Unmet Needs
1. **Provide updates when convenient and relevant with the device and location of choice**
	- ~ 2-3 days notice for notification to fill out forms in advance
	
	>  "Anytime you send me a link would be fine …Relevance, if asking me and my appointment is 10 days from now, ...answers might not be applicable"

	>  “I’d like an email before an appointment so I could do it at home and I don't have to scramble”

	> “I would do them ahead of time so the appts can be on time. I think if  the information is already there and I fill it out a day or two ahead,  then the dr. would have it right there and maybe they wouldn't run behind all the time..."

	> “That makes it so much easier. Not having to handover IDs ...its contactless which is a blessing at this time” 

2.  **Provide only updates for the things that have changed**
	 > “Since your last visit is there anything new?”
	 
	 > “Certain areas I need to talk about - jotted notes down as I have memory issues and I don't want to forget any”
	 
	 >  “Frankly, it would speed things up as it won't take provider time to do all of that”

4. **Display complicated medical words in customer friendly terminology** 
	 > “allot of big words and phrases that some people might not understand"

5. **Do similar things the same way with seamless next steps**
	> “The way I do everything in MyHealtheVet” “much easier that way” 
	
	> "Digital would be convenient to fill out now so you don’t have to write out"

	> "Why not send via text messages with the current appt. reminder with a link to the questions as that would take care of the memory problems and not have to worry about remembering to bring the paper back at a future date"
	
6. **Avoid having to repeat health history across the continuum of care**	
	 > “Repeat things to them is standard they have to repeat and ask same questions time and time again...do you not have anything your looking at about me...we are just use to it”
		
	> “A little redundant as I’ve done them so much, but Im sure its necessary”

### Moments that Matter
1.  **Waiting room** 
	- Long wait in the waiting room before seeing their Dr.
		> "I'll do anything to speed up the process so I won't be at the VA all day"

2. **Know what matters** 
	- Dr. has information provided by Veteran with what they want to focus on in the visit
	 	> “... the Dr. would have it right there….they could see the information and know what to focus on.”
		
		> “If patients are being asked to provide the information then it should be used…and becomes the basis for the discussion with the provider.”

3. **This visit communication** 
	- Dr. and Veteran discussion with information provided to Nurse minutes before
	 	> “I think they fall in to a big black hole and never to be seen again”
	 	
		> “The information is read over shortly after I give it to them and put on file.” VA provider use it to adjust their services”

4. **Transitions of care** 
	- Dr. to Dr. seamless transition of care
	 	> “So I don’t have to go through it over and over and over again”
	  	
		> “He tries to let both systems know what Im doing so they have the information.”
	
### Barriers

- Access (authorization) to MyHealtheVet due to requirement to verifying identity in a clinic before a Veteran can access their patient portal and can review the most up to date medical records information. 
- Going to a VA clinic annually is a checkbox for VA Benefits and Free Rx, therefore, the Veteran is not as engaged and motivated to prepare for the visit and discussion.

### Validated Assumptions

- Veterans want a digital pre-visit solution to update health information that is used by the care team.
	- Veterans that have private insurance or community care providers are accustom to completing pre-visit documentation ahead of a visit with a 'reminder' notification a few days before.  They feel this information is used by their care team during their visits. 
	- Likes the survey from a civilian doctor and fills it out on a website and fills out on his phone. They send him a link.
	-  Easy, simple and straightforward - well thought out.
	
		> “they (community providers clinic) send us an email 2 weeks before to check in online to say why he is there, update any meds, specific things he is dealing with, what he wants dr. to address during the visit, symptoms. ….And then you go in there you can tell by the Dr. questions and reactions that he never saw the information, so we wonder why we are going to the trouble of why we are filling this out” “Waist of time” “simple straight-forward”... but doesn’t seem to be accomplishing anything”

	 
	
### Incorrect Assumptions

- In VA facilities, veterans are not being asked to fill out pre-visit or post-visit information.
	- All is verbal with nurse and repeated by Veteran to physician.
	- Typically - Nurse is only asking Social History ~10 questions.   ie. Pain, Depression, Falls, Substance Use.
	- Typically - Nurse/Dr. are not reviewing and confirming past medical history is up to date.
	- Check in process (Kiosk) is well received and one of the easiest steps in the process for the veteran.

		> Last time had to fill out a paper form “It's been a long time”
	
		> “Some time ago..years ago...I had to fill out forms telling about my family hx, any of my medical things done. I’ve been in the system with the VA since 89...I don’t know the date I filled out information because they have it in the system”
	
		>  _Kiosk - Check in_ “was easy you put your card into the device you check in and wait a few minutes and they call you”

### Adjusted Problem Statement
**Pre-Discovery**

As a Veteran, I’m unable to easily and quickly provide pre and post visit documentation in a digital and discrete format that can be shared across facilities and my care team.

**Post Discovery _draft_**

I am unable to consistently share and update current health status and medical history that is leveraged in their care across the VA and community providers
	
	- _Words to consider adding: easily, quickly, share, repeat_
