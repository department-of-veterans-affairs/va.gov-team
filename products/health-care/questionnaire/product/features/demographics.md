## High Level User Story/ies

**Continuity of Care (5A)**

> As a Veteran, I want to provide my current health status and updates to my medical history so that I do not have to feel I have to repeat the information to my nurse and provider in the same and subsequent visits.

* **Use Case:** Veterans need the ability to see the demographic information that is on record to ensure accuracy and be able to verbally with the care team or through a digital edit experience update for the most up to date information.  
  - This provides the care team with the ability to call the correct contact numbers if they have followups on the questionnaire answered the veteran provided.
  - To alway ensure 3 patient identifiers are visible on screens where health information is shown this display also ensures the Veteran is logged into the correct account when filling out a questionnaire. 

* **Description:** Demographics - Show patient demographics that is visible to the clinical care team and the veteran in their profile.
