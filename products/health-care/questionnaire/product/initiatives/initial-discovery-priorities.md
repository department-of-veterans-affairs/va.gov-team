### Priorities

If you had to summarize the top 3-5 areas Veterans routinely want to discuss with you and their Dr. what would they be?

1.  Alwasy talk about medications - education goes along way

	- refills go to pharmacy and and the others fall off the list as the provider must renew the rx. 

2.  Acute concerns- injury or illness that is going on with them

	- need a view of what is main areas of concern both acute/chronic

	- have immediate issues ie. chest pain

3.  Know why they are coming in today or major triggers/life events

	- lost wife and how help me or my left foot hurting

	- list of priorities to discuss for the visit

	- then go through chronic problems - knowing what is really bringing them in that day and what concerns them.

8.  Past Medical Hx (procedure and surgeries)

9.  Family Hx (no view in CPRS today)

10.  Immunizations (must have actual document to scan in can’t be verbal)

11.  Problems/Health Concerns

12.  Social Hx not in clin reminders (maybe they are just need all to verify) – ie. Sexual, Work, family

#### Others in Vision not documented today

13.  Story Bio about the Veteran

14.  Acute concerns affecting me ie. Illness or injury and the main areas of health concerns to focus on. (this could be from the SHEP question)

15.  Hobbies, Interests, and Social Activities

16.  Goals for Treatment /Care Plan

17.  Cross Continuum Care Team – ie outside Dr/therapist/programs being seen for x condition and last appts.

## Additional Workflows to consider/Journey Map

18.  Notifications

19.  Unauthenticated vs. Authenticated

20.  Scheduling integration with appt. type trigger

21.  What form builder tool are we using for a content management system

22.  How are we integrating clinical reminders for time sensitivity in answers/additional tests that should be performed ahead of time

23.  What source system is the info going to Vista & Cerner?

		a.  Ie. If not a Cerner site yet should we still send the patient data?

24.  Master Person Index authentication /security for getting patient context

25.  MPI or Vets.gov patient profile for demographics

26.  What to do if seeing 3 clinics in same day – not have to fill out all of the forms??

27.  How to know if any appt types might need orders/labs/diagnostic tests ahead of visit?

## KPI’s

1.  Time to complete Clin Reminders is biggest issue. 15-20 mins by nurse

2.  Time spent by Nurse “relaying” why Vet is here and what screening is positive, other triggers/events.

3.  Immunizations records docs are brought into visit vs, verbal

4.  Time spent on documenting/understanding the reason for visit/Chief complaint that is coming from registration.

5.  Paper and process for printing pre-visit forms is cumbersome

6.  Ask more questions during dr. visit – studies show that these patients take an active role are happier with their care and see more improvement in health

7.  Higher satisfaction scores

8.  Reduction in anxiety for upcoming appts

9.  Reduction in things that have been forgotten to mention to the dr.
