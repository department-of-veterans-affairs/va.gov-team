# Healthcare Experience - Questionnaires Product Outline 

## Overview
Our goal is to improve the in-person and online pre- and post-appointment experiences for Veterans, contribute to physical distancing efforts in VA facilities, and better integrate Veteran-provided data in VA workflows by providing Veterans with a digital option to complete pre- or post-appointment questionnaires and screeners.

## Problem Statement
Veterans are unable to consistently share and update current health status and medical history that is leveraged in their care across the VA and community providers

- How might we improve the in-person and online pre-appointment experiences for Veterans?
- How might we contribute to physical distancing efforts in VA facilities?
- How might we better integrate Veteran-provided data into VA workflows?
- How might we provide Veterans with a digital option when only a paper option exist today to complete pre-appointment questionnaires and screeners?

## Job To Be Done
When going to a healthcare visit, I want to share my current health status and medical history so that my information can influence and be used to create my treatement plan accross the coninium of care.
 
### User Research - Key Findings

> **Key Theme:** Save Time and Optomize Care

1. Currently, Veterans are not asked to fill out many forms aside from initial intake and specialty care.	
2. Veterans who receive care from civilian and Non-VA providers are used to digitally filling out pre-visit forms.
3. Filling out forms is not a pain point if Veterans believe the information will benefit the care they receive.
4. The biggest pain point for Veterans is the handoff of information.
5. Veterans want a way to review previous answers and update when needed
6. Veterans believe that filling out digital forms would decrease wait times and optimize time with care providers.
7. Participants want a way to connect digital forms with their information in MyhealtheVet.
8. Veterans would want to receive a notification reminder to fill out digital forms 2-3 days ahead of their visit.
