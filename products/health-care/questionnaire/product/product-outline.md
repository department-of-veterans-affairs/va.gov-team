# Healthcare Experience - Questionnaires Product Outline

## Overview

Our goal is to improve the in-person and online pre- and post-appointment experiences for Veterans, contribute to physical distancing efforts in VA facilities, and better integrate Veteran-provided data in VA workflows by providing Veterans with a digital option to complete pre- or post-appointment questionnaires and screeners.

## Problem Statement

Veterans are unable to consistently share and update current health status and medical history that is leveraged in their care across the VA and community providers

- How might we improve the in-person and online pre-appointment experiences for Veterans?
- How might we contribute to physical distancing efforts in VA facilities?
- How might we better integrate Veteran-provided data into VA workflows?
- How might we provide Veterans with a digital option when only a paper option exist today to complete pre-appointment questionnaires and screeners?

| 1.  | Currently, Veterans are not asked to fill out many forms aside from initial intake and specialty care.                                                                                                                                                    | Time to complete Clinical Reminders during visit                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 2.  | Veterans who receive care from civilian and Non-VA providers are used to digitally filling out pre-visit forms.                                                                                                                                           | Up to date medications the veteran is currently taking/needs refilled                                                                                                                                                       |
| 3.  | Filling out forms is not a pain point if Veterans believe the information will benefit the care they receive.                                                                                                                                             | Unable to prepare for Veteran visit due to non-specific visit reason/chief complaint                                                                                                                                        |
| 4.  | The biggest pain point for Veterans is the handoff of information.                                                                                                                                                                                        | Unknown Acute and Chronic problems affecting the Veteran                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 5.  | Veterans want a way to review previous answers and update when needed                                                                                                                                                                                     | Unknown major life events or stressors affecting the Veteran                                                                                                                                                                |
| 6.  | Veterans believe that filling out digital forms would decrease wait times and optimize time with care providers.                                                                                                                                          |
| 7.  | Participants want a way to connect digital forms with their information in MyhealtheVet.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 8.  | Veterans would want to receive a notification reminder to fill out digital forms 2-3 days ahead of their visit.                                                                                                                                           |

### OKR's

**Objective/Job To Be Done:** When going to a healthcare visit, I want to share my current health status and medical history so that my information can influence and be used to create my treatment plan across the continuum of care.

**Signal:** Veterans are completing questionnairs before their vist and the care team is leveraging the information to inform their treatment plan.

**Key Results Focus:** Save Time and Optimize Care

- Personal Experience - exceed expectations
- Collaboration - empower partnership
- Seamless Journey - meet users where they are

**Personal Experience**

1. Increase in satisfaction ratings by the Veteran for (find question in SHEPP
2. Decrease in anxiety for upcoming appts
3. Increase safety ratings by Veterans based on allowing use of personal digital devices to complete forms and not physically being in waiting room to complete pre-visit documentation.
4. Increase the employee care team satisfaction by spending less time transferring veteran-provided data from one medium (paper, iPads) to the electronic health record system
5. Reduce facility wait times and length of visit time by reducing the number of tasks a veteran must complete within a facility

**Collaboration**

6. Increase in the number of questions asked by Veteran per visit.
7. Increase in satisfaction ratings by the Veteran based on patient/provider experience
   - more time to discuss the health plan and goals with their care team vs. data entry
8. Increase in clinical care team knowing the Veteran story/whats important to them.
9. Decrease in forgotten and not discussed health information updates per visit.
10. Decrease in the time to complete Clinical Reminders - Baseline estimation is 15-20 mins and is currently one of the biggest complaints by nursing
11. Decrease in provider time to complete a best possible medication hx and meds rec per visit

**Seamless Journey**

12. Decrease in the time spent by Nurse “relaying” the RFV, positive screenings, and other triggers/events to the provider.
13. X number of times Veteran provided RFV changed plan before arriving to a visit.
14. Increase faster access to care and more timely delivery of services
15. Increase in accuracy of health information available to the Care team
16. X number of Veterans completing a previsit questionnaire via unauthenticated experience vs. authenticated. - [insert specific research study] shows that consumers who are not required to login are XX more likely to complete a transaction with a business/healthcare facility.
17. Increase in the adoption of other VA services offered on va.gov improving the Veterans access health/wellness and benefits.
    - track via google analytics for when form completed did they go to other ares of va.gov and how long spent on the site after form completed.
18. Reduction in facility specific questions/wording differences the Veteran needs to complete.
19. Increase in employee productivity by decreasing their data entry of Veteran provided information into the system
20. Increase in visits per day as the care team will be able to see more patients or complete other activities related to the patient care.
21. Decrease in the time it takes during a visit to document the care team Note - as care team will not have to ask and document the same questions the Veteran just filled out on the form
22. Increasing the time the Care team can focus on the Veterans plan of care
23. Reduce time spent by the reception employees gathering and ensuring all fields are fill out by Veteran.

### Hypotheses

- Veterans want to fill out pre intake questionnaires to assit their care team with the most up todate status
- Veterans belive that by filling out pre visit intake questionnaires they will have an improved experience with the VA health system.
- Veterans believe that by filling out pre visit intake questionnaires they will not have to repeat their information as much as it will now be in their record.
- The Clinical Care team wants Veterans to provide pre-visit intake questionaires and screeners so they don't have to use so much time on data entry/asking questions.
- The Clinical Care team would prefer to have a view and confirm current status vs. having to ask the Veteran each vist as if they don't know their patients history.
- The Clinical Care team would like to know more about what is important to the Veteran or what is currently affecting them vs. spending their time focused on documeting screeners and health status.

#### Value Propositions

[**Veteran & Clinical Staff**](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/questionnaire/product/value-prop.md#veteran--clinical-staff) | [**Business**](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/questionnaire/product/value-prop.md#business)

## Assumptions and Risks

- Change Management needs to be championed and operationalized for patient provided-data workflow integration into the visit by the clinical care team
- Multiple EMR integrations make it challenging to know the source of truth for Health Information to pre-populate the record.
- FHIR specs are not all built into the Lighthouse roadmap nor both EHR's integration which will limit the standardized data interfaces
- Lighthouse roadmap doesn't have to write transactions currently available back into the source systems.
- Veterans are currently using MHV to view and contribute to their health records, and the strategy to build an intake questionnaire on va.gov will be out of their workflow.
- Authorization and Authentication on va.gov will allow for health data to be viewed and edited. The current authorization and authentication schemes do not support health record data.
- Standardized documentation/questions haven't been rolled out to the entire VA; therefore, the questions that we ask the Veteran might not align with the current state questions at a pilot site. Or we build the questionnaire with the current state (customized at each facility) questions and have to later update at a later date.
- The Forms library has some limitations that could lead to a scalability risk. Currently, any content updates are through a developer. This fact could lead to a content management risk, a bottleneck and a lack of customization
- There are security concerns around unauthenticated users using the clipboard system. It's not impossible, but there are concerns to consider when designing the system

## Solution Approach

- _What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?_
- _Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?_
- _What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?_
- _How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?_
- _ROI_
