# Executive Summary
Our goal is to improve the in-person and online pre- and post-appointment experiences for Veterans, contribute to physical distancing efforts in VA facilities, and better integrate Veteran-provided data in VA workflows by providing Veterans with a digital option to complete pre- or post-appointment questionnaires and screeners.

## Problem Statement

## Job To Be Done
When going to a healthcare visit, I want to share my current health status and medical history so that my information can influence and be used to create my treatement plan accross the coninium of care.
