# Conversation Guide Template for Moderated Research


## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Aricka and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about how we might improve the pre-appointment process of filling out intake forms and questionnaires. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 mintues.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?" 

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Before we begin, letâ€™s start with a few warm-up questions.

- Could you tell me about your service history?
- How often do you have appointments at the VA? 
- Tell me about a time you recently checked in for an appointment? What was your experience like?
    - Was that pre or post COVID-19? 
    - Have you had any online appointments post COVID-19? How has the process changed for checking into an appt? 
- Have you ever had to answer questions about your health before or after a VA appointment? (For example, on a form, screening tool, ipad, etc.) 
    - If so, what was that experience like? 
  

## Topic: Current experience - 10 minutes

- What do you normally do to prepare for an VA appointment/visit?
- Think back to the last time you had a VA appointment in person at a facility. Talk me through from end-to-end anything you remember about arriving at the facility, checking in for that appointment, etc. If you could, highlight any parts of that experience that were positive and any parts you find frustrating or annoying.
    - *If needed*: Did you have to answer any other questions about your health on paper or on an iPad prior to or after that appointment? 
    - *If yes*: What kinds of questions did you have to answer? (Further prompt: Health history, updates on the prescriptions you're taking, etc.)
    - *If yes*: How did you provide those answers? 
- For a typical visit, how many different questions about your health do you have to answer? 
    - What kinds of questions are you asked?
    - How do you answer these questions?     
- Do you find it pleasant, frustrating, or neutral (don't care) - to complete health forms or screeners at the VA?      
    - If frustrating: What are the most challenging parts of filling out information before a visit?
    - If pleasant: Why pleasant? 
- Do you ever have to share the same information more than once, such as with a different provider? 
    - Why do you think you sometimes are asked to provide information more than once? 
    - Is there any type of health information you expect to have to provide every time? 
- What kinds of appointments have you had at the VA? 
    - If they mention specialty care: Will you tell me about the last time you had an appointment with a doctor other than your primary or mental health provider, if you see one? What was that experience like?
    - Did you have to complete different forms or screeners prior to or after that appointment? 

- Do you see any non VA providers? 
    - Do you have to complete forms, screeners, or answer questions about your health for them?
    - Do you ever have to repeat information? 

### Things to listen for:

- _Do Veterans see forms/questionnaires as an acute problem or pain point?_
- _Where might our product fit into their curent process?_
- _What do they call the forms?_

## Topic: Veteran assumptions - 10 minutes

- What do you think happens to the answers you provide when you answer questions about your health at the doctor's office? 
    - Orally?
    - In writing?
    - on an ipad? 
    - On your own before or after the appointment?
    - Is there any difference in what happens to your information depending on how you provide it? 
    
    - if needed (prompt): Do you expect that information to be automatically shared with your other VA providers? 
    
- What format would be easiest for you to fill out medical forms (digital, paper, desktop, mobile, etc)?
- Think back to earlier when we were discussing the high points and pain points of your last appointment at VA. When in your preparation process for an appointment would you want to 

How can we make it easier for you to share your information with your doctor before a visit? After a visit? 

- If you could complete your forms online or on a mobile application, what do you think would happen to your information/data?

- Do you think specialty care forms would be different from your routine primary care forms?

### Things to listen for:

- _What methods might we explore for delivering forms?_
- _Their assumptions on what happens to their data_
- _Where to start?_

## Topic: Team/product assumptions - 10 minutes

## Follow-up questions:

- This might sound like a strange question, but if you were to describe to a fellow Veteran what they should expect about sharing health information with their providers at VA, what would you want them to know? 
- In your experience, what's the difference between a screener, a form, a quesionnaire -- or is there a difference?
