## Research Goals 

The goals of this study were to:
- Understand the current pre-appointment process for Veterans
- Identify areas to improve the current pre-appointment process
- Identify what forms Veterans are used to filling out before, during, and after an appointment
- Learn what data Veterans are curerntly providing to providers

## Research Methodology 

We conducted 30-45 minute remote interviews with Veterans and Caregivers via Zoom. 

### Who we talked to

- 7 Veterans
- 1 Caregiver
- Representative of ages 25 to 75+

## Key Findings

1. Filling out forms is not a pain point if Veterans believe the information will benefit the care they receive.
2. Veterans believe that filling out digital forms would decrease wait times and optimize time with care providers.
3. The biggest pain point for Veterans is the handoff of information.
4. Currently, Veterans are not asked to fill out many forms aside from initial intake and specialty care.
5. Veterans who receive care from civilian and Non-VA providers are used to digitally filling out pre-visit forms.
6. Participants want a way to connect digital forms with their information in MyhealtheVet.
7. Veterans want a way to review previous answers and update when needed

## Details of Findings

**Filling out forms is not a pain point if Veterans believe the information will benefit the care they receive.** <br> Veterans did not see forms/questionnaires as a major pain point, but did acknowledge the frustrations around providing information that their providers do not read before a visit. Additionally, Veterans found value in the social history and medication reconciliation questions (oral, not currently written or digital) a nurse asks before they see a provider.

 - Assumption: Nurses ask these questions orally and input or edit information themselves because it is quicker than having the Veteran fill out a form during their visit.
 
- Assumption: Providers review a patient's documentation before or during a visit, which can be frustrating for new patients. This may not be a pain point for patients wo have seen the same provider for years. 

> "If patients are being asked to provide the information then it should be used… and becomes the basis for the discussion with the provider."

> "I had to fill out forms telling about my family history, any of my medical things done. I’ve been in the system with the VA since 89... I don’t know the date I filled out information because they have it in the system."

**Veterans believe that filling out digital forms would decrease wait times and optimize time with care providers.** <br> Most participants mentioned that filling out a form ahead of their visit would save time because they wouldn't have to sit in a waiting room and/or fill out a clipboard. They also mentioned that it would save time for the clinicians if most patients filled out forms ahead of time.

> "I'll do anything to speed up the process so I won't be at the VA all day."

> “Frankly it would speed things up as it won't take provider time to do all of that.”

> “I would do them ahead of time so the appointments can be on time. I think if the information is already there and I fill it out a day or two ahead, then the doctor would have it right there and maybe they wouldn't run behind all the time. They could see the information and know what to focus on.”

**The biggest pain point for Veterans is the handoff of information** from VA nurse to VA provider and from VA provider to Non-VA provider. <br> Participants said that the questions their nurses ask before appointments are beneficial to their care, but do not feel that the information is relayed to their providers. Veterans feel that most of their heath information is shared when seeing VA specialists, but they are asked to complete forms and answer questions that the VA already has. 

> “Repeating things to them is standard. They have to repeat and ask the same questions time and time again... Do you not have anything you're looking at about me... we are just used to it”

> "...And then you go in there you can tell by the doctor's questions and reactions that he never saw the information. So we wonder why we are going to the trouble of filling this out."

**Currently, Veterans are not asked to fill out many forms aside from initial intake and specialty care.** <br> New patients and those who have just enrolled in VA Healthcare are required to fill out clipboards during their first few visits. After that, Veterans must attend one primary care appointment per year in order to retain VA Healthcare eligibility. There are minimal questions that a Veteran has to answer about their health unless they see a specialist for the first time, where they are asked (orally or clipboard/tablet) specific questions related to that visit. 

- Assumption: Because it is required to visit the VA once a year for primary care in order to maintain eligibility, some Veterans may not be motivated to fill out forms that they do not fill out in their current process.

**Veterans who receive care from civilian and Non-VA providers are used to digitally filling out pre-visit forms** though they do not hold this expectation for the VA. Those who receive care from civilian providers (not referred by VA) feel that the information they provide is beneficial to their care.

> “Its unusual that VA doesn’t hand me a clipboard or virtual clipboard to go into my doctor with.”

**Participants want a way to connect digital forms with their information in MyhealtheVet.** <br> All participants mentioned that they are familiar with and/or use MyHealtheVet. The most common feedback we received was that MyHealtheVet is helpful for chatting with providers and ordering and maintaining current medications. Multiple participants mentioned that they would find the tool helpful to them and that they could imagine pre-visit forms existing there, but it is difficult to authenticate their account so they do not use it.

- Assumption: we can utilize the prescription list in MyHealtheVet to pre-populate pre-visit documentation
Barrier: the authentication and login process henders Veterans from using MyHealtheVet 

> "Digital would be convenient to fill out so you don’t have to write out. I can't spell the name of my medications so I could do it at home and I don't have to scramble."

**Veterans want a way to review previous answers and update when needed** <br> Most participants do not mind answering the social history questions before they see their provider. They mentioned that they would like a digital form to pre-populate with answers from previous visits, but would want to be able to edit if anything changed.

> "I would use a digital option that said 'Since your last visit is there anything new?'"

## Additional Insights
- Veterans had a big focus on mental health and being honest with providers instead of being fearful of mental health stigmas
- Lots of feedback around not trusting VA system but loving the providers at their local clinics
- Overall, our initial assumption that Veterans fill out multiple forms before, during, or after a visit was incorrect
- Veterans want to be notified via text or email for these forms
- Veterans stated that they would want to receive these forms 2 to 3 days before their visits
- Veterans also stated that they would use a laptop/desktop to fill out digital forms with a phone being the second option

## Actionable Recommendations

**Identify new patient forms for primary care**

**Talk with nurses and providers to walk through social history questions**
- What is the provider "note" that is created for a primary care visit?
- Get a view of the actual form that nurses are filling out or asking questions from

**Investigate other avenues of care**
- Is primary care the right focus area?
- What other VA specialy forms exist?
- What is the inpatient or ED experience like?

**Research digital forms from civilian providers** 

**Rewrite problem statement**
- We should write a new problem statement that is reflective of these research findings

**Create personas**
 - Veteran new to using VA healthcare
 - Veteran who uses VA healthcare and civilian care
 - Veteran who has visited the same providers for 10+ years

**Create journey map**
- Create a assumption-research based journey map using these findings to understand where our solution may fit into the overall Veteran health journey
