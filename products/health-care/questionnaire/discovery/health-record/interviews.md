# Teams to schedule interviews 

- [X] **Lighthouse-** Product team - Need to understand the current fields that their healthrecord api has available and how it connects to vistA.  We need to understand the fields they have available for retrieve and the roadmap for write access to PGD.  There is a workflow challenge here if we are displaying a FHIR compliant medication list and then allowing the veteran to make comments/add data to the medication and we do not have a write back to that medication in the health record.  Where do we store this additional medication data and then the nurse/physician will need to type it into the med profile manually.
- [X] **Blue Button** - John UX designer - product team to give our team a demo and to understand the features their product has and limitations.  
- [ ] **Emily Mann - Healthcare research** she has been doing and interested if any of her priorities were around the medication list we can leverage what she learned. 
- [X] **Kaeli Yuen** work on COVID screener could assist with Immuniz documenation of covid shot.
- [ ] **Authenticated Home Page** - Product Team as they are working on a health record section where they planned to show Rx Refill - currently in research phase.     - Where are they getting the data from and how to we make our two products seamless for the veteran.
- [ ] **RxRefill app**- product team to give our team a demo and to understand the features their product has and limitations.  
- [ ] **Ask a Pharmacist App** - product team to give our team a demo and to understand the features their product has and limitations.  
- [ ] **VA Product Owner for Medline Plus Vendor** - Patient Education so we can understand what API's are available for a medlist education and reactions
- [ ] **Annie- product team** as their app might have features for med compliance and nudges with test message. 
- [ ] **MyHealthe Vet -** would be great to talk with the owner of the med list to undertand any data or experience challenges  or roadmap items they have.
- [ ] **Primary Care Stakeholders** at Loma Linda/Hawaii and others to meet with to ensure we know the main areas of improvement we can make with a veteran updated bpmh. ie lots of workflow time could be saved if done in advance. ie. 80% time savings 
- [ ] **VA Pharmacy** - full med workflow - anyone in operations for the pharmacy who can talk about pain points and technological set up. Maybe they would know about the Walgreens collaboration too?
