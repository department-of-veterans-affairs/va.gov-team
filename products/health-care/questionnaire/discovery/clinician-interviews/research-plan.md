# Research Plan for Healthcare Experience Team - July 2020 

## Goals	
This research is for the Healthcare Experience team to learn about the pre-appointment process from the clinician perspective. 

**Background**

Our goal is to improve the in-person and online pre- and post-appointment experiences for Veterans, contribute to physical distancing efforts in VA facilities, and better integrate Veteran-provided data in VA workflows by providing Veterans with a digital option to complete pre- or post-appointment questionnaires and screeners.

The problem: As a Veteran, Iâ€™m unable to consistently share and update current health status and medical history that is leveraged in my care across the VA and community providers.

**Research questions**
- Who are Veterans interacting with when they are filling out documents?
- What is the process like of referring Veterans to other providers/specialists?
  - What information/data is transferred from VA Provider to specialist?
- What forms/notes are clinicians filling out during visits with Veterans?
  

## Method	
We will conduct remote interviews via Zoom

## Participants and Recruitment	
We would like to talk with clinicians who have extensive knowledge of the forms and processess related to the Veteran healthcare experience.
