1.  Can you walk us through what a typical appointment looks like?
    
    -   Consider New patient visits, followup, annual physical, sickness/injury. etc.
       -   What are the standard questions you're required to ask Veterans?
       -   Are there questions that you like to regularly include that are not in the clinical documentation?

Chief Complaint vitals, go through clinical reminders. Until dx in the chart and BMI then others will populate
- vitals are prior to clinical reminders as some are triggers
- clin. reminders take time with specific questions verbal
- patients don't understand them
- Then will ask allergies, demographics- phone address
- Then nurse will go talk to dr. face to face. to let them know what the Veteran is here for this reason, screening positive, info collected. then the Vet will go see the dr. 
	- positive for depression or alcohol then addition evaluations that only the dr. can do
	- nurse reminds them as not all dr. look at them.

Huddles every morning - take to dr. info we have collected great tool to use in huddles.  Me. X is coming at 8 and his is routing followup but 10 Am hurt his foot maybe call and get xray prior to him coming.

    -   What paperwork is involved with treating these patients?
4.  Where do you typically document these questions - paper or digital (which section of the EHR)?
    -	Where would it be helpful for that info to land in record. if it was in pre- assessment so you know what to review for upcoming appt. 	

    -   How long do you typically spend with screening questions?
	    - Spend about 15-20 mins with vitals- run through faster or don't get done.

    -   Do you notice the answers change frequently from the last visit when the Veteran was asked the questions?
	    - change response to questions. 
		- unintended weight loos/stress (triage note) easier to find if they changed that. also look back to see if mental health and look at dr. last note tell if pt. was depressed last time here. 
		- wife passed away 2 months ago and see triggers and offer resources to help. and will likely more to agree.
5. Do you have an easily accessible view of the previous answers to the questions to reference?

	- my last note and dr. last note to see the plan of care.
	- ok talking to dr. or nurse but not refer to specialist.
	
5.  What does that process look like today, with an increase in telehealth appointments/COVID protocol in place?
	 
	 - Not allot of the screenings are happening and are only focusing on the depression and ptsd and MD's are now taking on more screenings when they see the vet without the nurse
	 - trying to do nurse or care coordinator telehealth visits before the dr. appt to get the screenings done ahead of time
6.  Is there health record information about the Veteran that could be helpful to reference when talking /documenting screening questions?
	 - Pre-visit summary helpful thy have created
		- helpful has everything what reminders due, ask smoking etc
		- patient found it helpful and starting with the meds then reconciling then going to the dr.
		- hard because best practice is not used across all clinical teams. 
	- alcohol - is example of questions could do ahead of visit
		- how often then none/never then no additional questions
		- 7 days to followup.
		- most understand the question
	- Smoker same. 

	- Depression and ptsd- if nobody is getting alerted.  24 hours after initial assessment do do followup for suicide.  
		- difficulties with followup
	- Covid- video there are clinical reminders could go over- screening is positive then if the pt. wasn't able to do with 24 hours. 
	- Annual learning evaluation- need to be actual questions- barriers to learning checklist should be worded differently for veterans- need examples. prob with hearing, 
	- Readiness to learn- asked how do you feel about wanting to engage to help with teaching you about your diabetes.
		- Deny or lack interest. 
		- learning preference- handouts, group, 1:1
    
7.  Is there information about your Veteran patient that you wish you had prior to your appointment?
    
    -   how long before seeing the Veteran before the appt. would you open their chart to prepare for their appt.?
    -   Do you feel you have a personal view of the veteran and what is important to them both medically and lifestyle/family?
8.  ~~Who do you refer patients to for specialty care?~~
    
    -   ~~Do they have pre-appointment digital forms/experiences for patients?~~
9.  What information do you want a Veteran to review/update ahead of your visit?
	- info collected before visit- comfortable.-  depends on population -" more forthcoming when answering by them selves instead of in-front of them. " 
	- get allot is oh I don't want that in my chart. 
	- established veterans are use to the questions - pre-screening to save time allot will be forthcoming. new VA patients might not be as forthcoming
    
10.  Are their question that should only be asked by a clinician and documented vs. having the Veteran provide in an intake form?
	 - dr. asks family history
	 - dr. asks problems 
	 - or medications
  
11.  If a veteran had a question about an intake form ahead of a visit would sending a secure message/text/call to the clinic be preferred?
	 - knowing main concern and why they are coming. - call center schedules - could have done certain things prior.   
    
12.  Do you typically find the reason for visit documented from the scheduling solution matches the verbal description the veteran provides why they are there. ie. Chief Complaint?
	   - doesn't match - call center symptom is suppose to go to a triage nurse or call center doesn't ask why "patient preference" if we know whats going on - triage line is helpful pain urination can order a UA and already collected data vs. then to send to lab and wait for tests.
13.  If you had to summarize the top 3-5 areas Veterans routinely want to discuss with you and their Dr. what would they be?
		- talk to them about - always medications - education goes along way 
		- veterans just hang out and sit around and talk to other veterans.  not allowed to stay there.
		- refills go to pharmacy and how to get them fell off the list. 
		- Acute concerns- injury or illness that they vary going on with them in 
		- need a view of what is main areas of concern - have a immediate issues vs. chest pain 
		- know for dr. why they are coming.
		- lost wife and how help me or my left foot hurting
		- really appreciate it veterans, would see as a positive. because they feel like we don't know them.
