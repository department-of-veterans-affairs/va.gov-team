	- [CMS Patient Experience Surveys](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Research/CAHPS) - Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers & Systems (CAHPS)
		- [CAHPS® Clinician & Group Survey and Instructions](https://www.ahrq.gov/sites/default/files/wysiwyg/cahps/surveys-guidance/cg/about/cg_3-0_overview.pdf)

		- Pretty cool [Map view of Satisfaction Scores by location](https://www.accesstocare.va.gov/Shep/Statemap) - could be useful in targeting certain locations for pilots.

6.  What are the questions the Nurse/Provider are asking the Veteran that would be helpful to be filled out by the Veteran in advance?
	- Nurse question - clinical reminders will apply depending on patient risk factors
		- the questions don't match what the nurse is asking when they go back 
		
7.  I haven't gotten much intel from Shane on your conversations, so I'm wondering if you can share with our team what the two of you talked about/what you're looking to build for Hawaii?
	
8.  What is your blue sky, anything is possible vision for this check in process?
	- high functioning team pre- work done ahead of time
	- clinical pharmacist of the time with provider- virtually 
	- clinical reminders in advance - meet with RN ahead of the visit CR before they see the Primary care provider.  
	 - don't pay at the time of visit they receive bill in the mail 

9.  How long in advance would you allow a Veteran to check in for an appointment? ie. do they have to be at the facility or can they be in route?
	- checkin - pre-covid  no before now - covid is 15 mins.
	- Because they need parking some will arrive 1-2 hours early
	- once directed to checkin then they get direct up to the module 
	- automate that process- "im on my way" option to text to pac team.  checked in and ready - providers are ready and you
	- checkin on phone, prompt for updated, insurance info, submit then check alert to veteran.  
	- screeners are asking- do you have an appt. they would know they are there for an appt. 

10.  I know you've talked to Shane a bit already about the COVID screener and eScreener--what are some features/aspects of those tools that sounded appealing to you and your current needs?
		- QR code - scan to get to the website- post in the waiting room - for unauthenticated
		- green or red screen visual queue to be screened further if they were good to go. 
		- CPRS- flag that pops in CPRS on th patient list and then in pt. chart.
			- Health factor from lab package- someone is entering in.

### Notes

- only on the patient experience-
- working on employee facing tools discussions- great have feedback took employees to get a pulse on how.
