# VA Researchers

Met with three eScreening researchers from San Diego.

## Key Takeaways

- eScreening research data does not need to be in CPRS for the participating veterans.
- The researchers mentioned that some of the challenges that they run into with their research questionnaires and the eScreening platform are:
  - the VA firewall causing study participants challenges accessing questionnaires that they should have access to
  - and the system not working correctly on a broad spectrum of devices that Veterans utilize to complete the questionnaires. 
- They also discussed some of the ways and challenges they have sharing information about the research process with Veterans. 
- Email was stated as one method that they utilize to send out questionnaires that they want Veterans to fill out on their own before meeting for a research session, etc. 
- As expected, they set up the entire series of questionnaires needed for the whole study at the beginning, then just release the questionnaires to the participants at the appropriate times. Releasing questionnaires early can hurt the integrity of the study.
- What is the plan for the utilization of eScreening versus VARedCap for research? 
- Could/should va.gov help with anything mentioned in #1/#2 while still maintaining the authentication and privacy necessary for research questionnaires? 
- Researchers have been having problems with their consenting process due to COVID.
