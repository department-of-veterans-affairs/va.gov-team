# BHL Demo

Spoke with Doctor and BHL team members.
Dr.’s background: Measurement-based care. Clinical and academic background. In Philly. Written papers on this stuff.
- Low burden on veteran and clinician
- Mental health assessments
- BHL solution used daily in thousand of times in VA. Most problems with the system caused by VA process and not he system itself. For instance, they wanted to turn on text and emails for along time. They will finally have that in December.

Partnered with OMHSP? to get BHL implemented.  There are two places that these instruments have been required to be put. There is a mental health file, where these instruments kind of live as data. They are only mental health surveys. They haven’t put any other surveys in there. And as a progress notes. They are stored there, so they can send clinical reminders. 

Interviewer: Hopefully, we can leverage a lot of what you have learned as we go into this new era.

BHL: self-report health data from home. Looking at outcomes. They have done patient satisfaction. Available at all VA facilities. Entering into Veteran devices. How?

They shared a map image highlighting all the sites using BHL everyday.

Workflow: 
Veteran responds (authorization used there). Veteran uses one time code. They see authentication as a barrier to Veterans completing these surveys. They haven’t had the Veteran authenticating. VeText or email with a code. The form opens and they can fill it out. The form gets sent back and the code links the form to the Veteran. They don’t have a portal where they are looking at this information. 

They can set our form up, so we can see it in their system.

Schedule Assessment
- Want to collect information overtime. So they can set it up to send repeatedly.

Message to Veteran
Veteran Response

Provider Alerted
- There is a provider dashboard, but if Veterans answer that there is a problem, then other alerts are triggered.

Save to EHR
Select a note title, and select to add to EHR. For mental health, then they put each answer into Vista. For Cerner, all files go to one single place. It doesn’t create an unsigned note unless a provider reviews it. The system alerts them when something is passed due and alerts other personnel. 

Mental health file, called Mental Health Assistant tool that views the data, in Vista. OMSP owns that file. If you want to add a questionnaire that isn’t mental health, then there isn’t a place for it. MHL (in Austin). That file is going away with Cerner. It would go into a progress note, but there is no way to get it into data elements. 

There are some other questionnaires that don’t show up in the MHL, but will show up as a progress notes. This also supports research studies. They have ways to get the data out if needed.

All data is stored there forever. They never physically delete any data. 

Does the data go into CDW? If it goes to the MHL, then it goes to CDW. It might be as a note, but not as a data element. There just isn’t a place to store data elements other than the mental health file. Cerner  - it is store in PowerForms.

Quantifying Mental Health Check-up. It used myHealtheVet. It can then show all of their scores. You can see their past scores. You are pushing the stuff to them. Less than 30% of Vets have signed up for MyHealtheVet. There are advantages and disadvantages. They have had a conversation with their provider and they know that it is coming. It mimics an encounter in the office. They have had tablets in waiting rooms for 5 years. They have info on length of the surveys. 

Direct interface was an innovation grant 10 years ago, which is now going away with Cerner and FHIR. Written in MUMPs, which is very old. 

How will a Veteran be able to track their progress? There isn’t a portal for that, but they can log into myHealtheVet. This application can create graphs. The providers can send a secure message. The other tool allows the Veteran to see the graph almost immediately. The providers have been good about screensharing the graph on telemedicine visits. It isn’t as easy for the Veteran to take a look at by themselves. 

Mental Health Check-up. You see your progress when you do an assessment. Can’t come back and look at it. There is no portal. That has only been in the field for two weeks. 

Does the Veteran have an opportunity to complete half? They have the ability to submit half, then complete the other half. There is something different about filling out 15 assessments at a time in the waiting room, but it is different at home. At home, people don’t have the attention span. 

Are you looking for % completion? If you send them a link, then they may or may not complete everything. 

Are there any follow-up that they complete? 

It isn’t happening in a vacuum.

Turn around time given to the Veteran to fill it out is 92 hours. 

Should they be linked to appointments? Is the time interval more interesting?

Adding other forms to this system is the simplest of all tasks.

VeText and Email smarts is built in that if you start with text, then the email is blocked.

Can’t see both tools being used by the same provider (referring to Medical Health Check-up and BHL). The provider will use one or the other. It isn’t easy to get providers build this into their workflow. 

Mental health check-up took about 5 years to built. The questions are pretty close. Cerner integration. Are they just using FHIR? FHIR and other stuff? They have HL7 interfaces. Longer-term…those in V-FIV. 

Sending Outlook messages? No messages via CPRS that the Veteran filled out the assessment. They just haven’t heard that request. If they pick the assessment to go CPRS and they don’t sign it, then it would be there as a view alert.

Someone requested BHL metrics.
