# Dec. 3 Primary care physician #

## Key Takeaways ##
- Adding our questionnaire information into the PVS, which is part of the AVS application, sounded like a good solution. It doesn’t change much to their existing workflow.
- Current gets patient-generated data from the nurse home telehealth program, secure messages, and devices/printout that patients physically bring to their appointments. 
- Finds patient-generated data extremely helpful specifically blood glucose and blood pressure, pulse, pulse oximetry, and weight.
- Most interested in the data points mentioned above, but open to other patient-generated data, such as steps, etc.
- Interested in seeing patient-generated data in CPRS as long as it was clearly labeled as patient-generated data.  

## Interview ##
Began by reviewing the mobile prototype and summarized the Veteran feedback on the questionnaire.   Dr.: “You have made a lot of progress.” In general, Dr. didn’t have too many questions on the prototype. Dr. did ask if Veteran understood the ranking. Let Dr. know that we plan to try and recruit Veterans with cognitive disabilities in the next round.

Interviewer: We want to talk to you about what that flow would look like from a clinician standpoint. We [were] able to demo the pre-visit summary. Can we digitalize that flow, because right now you are printing it out? There is a batch process to print it out. But what if we can embed this into that flow into the pre-visit summary and into the after visit summary.

Dr.: Yes, that would be good. [It was] probably indicated that the pre visit summary in my experience has been most useful when it is printed out, so the main part of that is that a patient can actually review their medications. You have seen it and [name redacted] have really programmed that list in there, so it is very clear and easy for the patients to review. The top part of the pre visit summary is these sort of questions. The purpose of your visit today and such. I guess that we have thought about if there is a way for the patient to complete the pre visit summary without having to print it out. Either they do it prior to the appointment and there has been some keen interest in that. Particularly with so many of the appointments going to Telehealth now with the pandemic, so I don’t know if there is any thought or discussion about that. That certainly would make that medication review very efficient. In my experience when we print it out and the patients can review it, it is really useful if they do it and it is efficient and saves time. But when it is on paper like that, maybe 50-60% of patients will actually do it. Sometimes it is just folded up in their pocket or they have it and they say “I didn’t know that I was supposed to do something with this.” That might be able to be improved by some scripting by the MSAs or the nurses or whatever. Anyway, that is my experience with that. If this was embedded in that, that would be great.

Interviewer 2: We talked through a couple of different ideas from a workflow point of view. The first one would be that they get the link, they fill out the clipboard, then in AVS under the pre visit questionnaire it would repopulate those questions. Then, you could still print it at that point to do the med rec at that point if you wanted to. Then, the questions becomes how does this data end up in the medical record. A couple of options that we talked about was that the revisit summary would pre-populate and when you print that, then it would end up as a PDF in Vista imaging with a stub note to tell you to go to that. Another option that we talked about if that the end product would be populating the after visit summary with the questions or both, I guess. Such as your questions were (motions that there is a list) and include that in the after visit summary and that is how it gets to the medical record. The third idea, because one of the things that we want to do is get this data somehow after the clinician reviews it in the medical record. The last option is creating an unsigned note and send you a view alert that the pre visit questionnaire was done. I don’t know if you have a thought on any of those three?

Dr: So right now, the way that we have it set up is if the pre- visit summary is printed and the nurse reviews it with the patient or somebody else does before they get to the provider, then that actually goes into CPRS as a note for the provider to review and you can sign off on that acknowledging that you received that, so I think form a workflow standpoint if that information was in the pre-visit summary and that all was populated in the CPRS and done by somebody else and done ideally before they got to the provider, then that part of the workflow would be great. If the pre visit summary is coming to the provider with this information with your information from the clipboard pre-populated then the med rec still needs to be done. In my thinking then that would have to be on paper, so the patient could view that med rec.

Interviewer 2: What I was thinking was when they first get there, the MSA or the nurse, whoever prints it out, goes please review these questions and by the way review your medication. The nurse could review it. [Name redacted] was pointing out that a lot of sites massive print these out, then mail them, so we were trying to figure out how that would work within that workflow. You would probably have to change that if we did that and have them review it in the waiting room instead of mailing it out. With virtual, that is a different question, do you have your nurse see them before you see them? 

Dr: That is hit or miss. They are supposed to be. I don’t know if it is consistently happening. We are still kind of working through some of that here locally as to the nurses going in and doing clinical reminders prior to virtual appointments. I’m sure that other facilities are at different stages related to that and have more developed processes, then we do at this point. 

Interviewer 2: I’m sure that the next step would be to include med rec on the clipboard as well, but before then for this version is we got it into the pre-visit summary in AVS at least it would be there for a various number of workflow. The MSA printing it. The nurse reviewing it with the patient, then putting it in CPRS. You reviewing it before their visit if they did it early enough. It would be a place for you to look at it. I don’t know if that works. 

Dr: Yeah.

Interviewer 2: The other option is just an unsigned note for you to review as soon as it is filled out. The third one is leaving it in the pre-visit summary, but also having a way to put it into the after visit summary. “The questions you asked were…” Do you think that information needs to get into the after visit summary? The reason that I’m asking is because San Francisco wants the eScreening data to be in the After Visit Summary. That may be a specific use case to mental health and I don’t know if it makes sense in primary care. 

Dr: I don’t know that it is that critical that their pre appointment questions necessarily get to the after visit summary, because a lot of times what the patient may ask. I don’t know how to explain, but it kind of changes through the appointment. They may be pointing out this problem, but it is related to something else and it might be confusing for them to see “Oh hey, I asked about this, but this diagnosis over here say that.” Maybe we don’t want to empower them in that way, but I don’t know. I don’t know. I would just say maybe in the pre visit summary would be my…

Interviewer 2: [Name redacted] mentioned view alerts. Would it make sense to actually…we don’t have a trigger for that? Nevermind. So in your workflow as you prepare for your visits you would maybe go into AVS and see if they filled it out and see if that data helps you to prepare for their visit or would you only really use it the day of the visit?

Dr: Actually beforehand would be nice in some/ a lot of cases.

Interviewer 3: We got a lot of feedback from Veterans that they would be interested in hearing if they entered something that would potentially trigger that oh hey I need this imaging done or this lab test done or bloodwork done a head of time. They did mention that they would be interested in that. 

Dr: Yeah. I think that there is variation by provider, but I think a lot of providers would want to look a head and see why is this patient comes in to see me today or what other concerns do they have?

Interviewer 4: Would it make sense? The pre visit summary and the after visit summary are really documents that are intended to be consumed by the patient so to speak. And here we are really just trying to get the answers to the questions in front of the provider. In either case, if it is in the pre visit summary or the AVS it is probably going to be buried somewhere in there. Would it make sense to create another AVS document like pre-visit checklist or pre-visit questions that is geared towards the provider compared to towards the patient. Then again, putting this information in the AVS for the provider to review prior to the encounter. Would it make sense to either pop that up in a pop-up in the AVS. Again, not at part of the AVS itself, but rather in either a separate document geared toward the clinician or a pop-up that would provide the questions and then the answers as provided by the patient. We are trying to communicate with the provide, but putting it into the PVS or AVS may not be the most efficient way is what I’m getting at.

Dr: Ummm…Well, I see what you are saying and it is an interesting point. To me, simpler is better. I think one thing that provider complain about is that they have so many places to look for information. In a provider’s mind and I remember this from year’s ago when we they were trying to create CPRS-R (CPRS reengineered), I went to this meeting in Denver. One thing that I took away from that is and it was fascinating is that providers want to do everything in CPRS and not just in CPRS. They want to do everything in their note. And that is the impression that I have gotten from our providers over the years. They don’t want to deal with too much extraneous stuff, so they already feel stressed by secure messaging and Vista imaging, then you add the AVS and PVS on top of it. They just don’t want to deal with so many things. The simpler that we can make it for them the better. The other thing that I will say about that is and [name redacted] you have been very involved with this. Whatever we do with this that we should integrate with the medication reconciliation workgroup, because they are very keen on particularly now with Telehealth and so much remote visits going on that they are trying to utilize the PVS and AVS to accomplish the requirements around med rec.

Interviewer 4: I hear what you are saying Dr. and that totally makes sense. When I hear you mention doing everything in a note, [name redacted] has had an idea for years. They could do their orders and everything from their note.

Interviewer 2: And actually from typing, you know how in Word autocorrects or makes suggestions. You know now in Gmail it suggests things as you as typing. Almost that kind of thing from codes and everything you could do that from within your note with the keyboard without pointing and clicking. I always wanted to write that. I actually found a scholarly article that talks about someone who started developing it. It is like an IDE for writing progress notes for physicians. 

Dr: We have talked about this before and they like a free text box for their assessment and their impression and that would take care of the encounter for them. That is the way that they think. I think they understand that there is limitations, but they are frustrated by it. 

Interviewer 2: It sounds like populate the pre-visit summary and the act of printing it would create a PDF. Today, it doesn’t put that data in the note. It puts it in a PDF.

Interviewer 4: I had that wrong. The PVS doesn’t go into Vista Imaging, but we have the AVS stub note is really just a stub note. There really isn’t much in there. But the PVS doesn’t have all of the content from the pre visit summary, but a lot of it is. So the note for the PVS is richer. There is more information there from the PVS. 

Interviewer 3: Who creates that? Does the nurse do that?

Interviewer 4: The note gets auto created when it is printed. It just doesn’t go to Vista imaging.

Interviewer 1: What if you don’t print it? How does that work? Can it still be auto created?

Interviewer 4: Yeah. Well currently both documents are hard - they are printed. That is part of the workflow. Unless you are creating a PDF copy and sending it through secure messaging, but either way. Even in that case, even if you create a PDF that is an option in lue printing it, but doing so will also create the ITU note. 

Interviewer 2: I imagine that we could create just a “Save note” type of thing. 

Interviewer 4: There has been some requests for that over the years. Well create the ITU note and send it to Vista Imaging without having to print it and so yes, that could be an option.

Interviewer 1: It sounds like we do have a path that is acceptable to you Dr. in that let’s incorporate it into the pre- visit summary. 

Dr: Yeah.

Interviewer 1:  We are going to start with the three questions that are at the top of the pre-visit summary, but our next focus would be medication reconciliation, so we are hoping that the patient could do it all digitally, especially for a virtual appointment and if they are not going to be in the office that they don’t need the print out to confirm what medications they are taking. I think that is it. Any other questions?  Interviewer 2: No…  Interviewer 1: On things that we are looking at long long term,  we wanted to get your feedback on is devices and getting device data in front of a provider, so this is kind of a long term goal. I’m going to hand it over to [Interviewer 3] to ask you questions, but we wanted to understand how that plays into your practice and work today.

Interviewer 3: Do you routinely have your patients send you data from devices, such as blood pressure monitor, CPAP machines, glucometer, apps or wearable devices?

Dr: Wearables, I haven’t seen too much of that. Typically, I use telehealth fairly frequently, so we have nurse telehealth, where they are given a health buddy, but that stuff goes directly into CPRS. They have a health buddy at home, so you could have blood pressure, pulse, pulse oximeter, glucose, weight and that is transmitted directly to Vista through the health buddy and then they are monitored by a nurse. For me personally, I use secure messaging a fair amount, so I’d said..I can’t tell you how many of my patients are on secure messaging, but pretty high. I’ll tell them. Hey, your blood pressure is high. We are going to adjust this medication. In a week from now, can you send me your blood pressure readings. Some patients are really good about it. Some will send me excel spreadsheets, some will just type it into secure messaging, others will put it in a Word document. There is no consistency to it. A lot of them forget or just don’t do it. That is the main ways that I get data from home. 

Interviewer 3: What is the first thing that you said? Health buddy?

Dr: It is a nurse telehealth program. They get a health buddy and the data comes from that. It is transmitted over the phone line to the VA. I’m not sure what the actual linkage is. I don’t know if it goes into Vista or if it is screened first by the nurse and they input the data. I’m not quite sure, but as a provider, I get a nice note that says from Nov. 15 -30 and it lists all the blood pressures in a nice table and what the averages were. And whatever other data that I’m monitoring it. 

Interviewer 3: The two ways that you actually get this data is in a note or in the secure messaging portion. Is there any other ways that you get this data?

Dr: No. Well, Yes. There is another way that I think about it. Some will come in with their glucometer. They will just put it on the table and say here is my blood sugar readings. I press the button and I can see the 7 days average, the 14 day average and the 30 day average. All of that. So I get some of that. Some of them bring it in on printed paper. That is very common now that I think about that. They come in for an appointment and I get a hand-written list. Sometimes we give them little booklets that are a little more structured, so they can put the data in. It is really variable. It is extremely helpful. I would say…I don’t know if I could put a percentage on the number of patients who do that. It is not high. I would say at least among my patients who are giving me information outside of the telehealth /nurse telelhealth program is 15%, maybe. I ask for it a lot more, then I actually get it. 

Interviewer 3: How does this impact that quality of your interactions with your patients and the quality of their care?

Dr: It is tremendously helpful. Particularly, if you are trying to be efficient and do things between appointments. I make a medication adjustment. I don’t want to wait to see them back in three months, when I have availability or make them come back if it is difficult for them to get here in a couple weeks to try to squeeze them into my schedule. If I can just see the data and see what is happening with their blood pressure or glucose. I find it extremely helpful. [Name redacted] may comment on this too. We have had the nurse home telehealth program, which is a VA program, and my recollection on that is that is it pretty under utilized, but some of that may be barriers on staffing and that. But I also get the feeling that a lot of physicians don’t want to be bothered with something else. [Name redeacted] is that your recollection of home telehealth.

Interviewer 2: I would say that it is provider specific. Because providers that are really into it and their are providers that aren’t. That home telehealth, there is a whole dashboard that they look at and track. I don’t know why it is not used more. Liked you mentioned before, for awhile it was staffing. A nurse can have X number of telehealth patients and at Loma Linda, we were at our max and it was a constant back and forth that we need another nurse to expand the program and this kind of things. 

Interviewer 3: Are most of these devices prescribed by someone or they sign up for a program or do you have any people bringing their own devices and bringing this information to you?

Dr: It would be more prescribed. Mostly, where I get data is glucometers for blood glucose checks and blood pressure monitors. I think most VA probably operate this way, we provide them glucose meters and those. There is a little bit of a process that they have to go through to get those. Blood pressure monitors, we actually hand them to people in clinic and show them how to use it and send them home with it. It is most devices that we have given them. Some of the other peripherals and stuff that you know…I rarely get stuff. I have had a few patients that have had the devices where you can actually monitor your heart rhythm, so it is an app on your phone and you take this little electrode. I have one to, because I wanted to see what it was like. You put it on your chest and you get a heart rhythm out of that. I had a patient recently who said that his Apple watch kept telling him that he had atrial fibrillation, so I put an event monitor on him and the Apple watch was a false positive.

Interviewer 3: I was going to ask about Fitbits and Apple Health too, so…

Dr: I personally get. Very little of that information. I have read about these smart homes where you can have your patient and there are sensors that measure their various biometrics and stuff. That would be great, but I don’t know that we are there. 

Interviewer 3: Are there any challenges with that data or accessing that information?

Dr: Yeah. We have had some staffing that is limiting, like the nurse telehealth, but usually I don’t have any problems getting it when I ask for it. Honestly, I would say, but guessing at the numbers, I would say 9 out of 10 patients really really like it. They like that contact and attention and that they are being attended to. At least in my experience, they really like it. All of the other stuff beyond that is sort of unformatted. It is trying to find a way for the patient to get that information to me. Maybe they don’t have MyHealtheVet access, so they are just bringing it to me on pieces of paper. Or I tell them that “oh hey, you have myHealthEVet. You can just put it in secure messaging and send it to me.” It is variable. Sometimes I get it and sometimes I don’t. There isn’t a lot of structure to it beyond that home telehealth program in my experience.

Interviewer 3: In a perfect world, how would you want to interact or have data presented to you?

Dr: Obviously the home telehealth is really good for patients that have particular issues like they are really sick with heart failure or I’m trying to control their blood glucose that is really helpful. For other patients, I could have sworn, at one point on MyHealtheVet, on the website on the patient facing side. I think that there is some kind of table that they can enter some of there metrics. I could have sworn that the patient could have granted us access to that and we would be able to see it. I don’t think that ever happened. I have had patients print out their MyHealthEVet information and bring it into me. I’ve Neve had and I’ve even asked patients is there is a way that you can give me access. I don’t think that ever happened. 

Interviewer 2: That was back during the days or PHR, when the Personal Health Record, was the big hip thing. I don’t know if they ever made it, so (40:37) they could ever provide people with permission. I think they did, but I don’t remember. 

Dr: If they did, then it never really came into fruition or practice. That would certainly give some structure to it. If there was some structure to the data and patients were even prompted to do it and I could easy go to that site and easily access it and pull it into the medical record that would be very useful. 

Interviewer 3: Are there any devices that you would be particularly interested in that you are not currently interacting with or having patients send information to you from?

Dr: No. I think for me as a primary care provider, it is mostly going to be blood glucose and blood pressure, pulse, pulse oximetry, and weight. I can’t think of anything else that would be terribly useful at this point. 

Interviewer 3: Are there any particular devices or information that you wouldn’t want access to? If it is information overload, things that like. What would you not want?

Dr: I think that patients appreciate having access to the provider. I think that myHealtheVet and secure messaging I use a lot. The vast majority of patients are very respectful in that. There is always a few that want to tell you day-by-day what is going on with them. Obviously, that kind of subjective stuff is…it is helpful only to an extent that it is going to help in their case. When they are excessively obsessing over all this stuff, then it is a little bit hard. Discrete data points that I’m interested in are the ones that I mentioned before that I’m really confined to in my practice. I can’t think of anything else really.

Interviewer 3: When is it important to differentiate between patient-generated data and data that is created within the healthcare system?

Dr: That is very important. We want to be able to separate that. For blood pressure for example, it is useful to get the home data and there is some good data that shows that may be in fact a better reflection of the patient’s blood pressure as an example. Not all patients are using their monitors correctly using the right technique and that sort of thing, so for sure separating that data is very helpful.

Interviewer 3: Is there any patient-generate data that you would like to go into CPRS? What type of data would you like to review before entering or submitting into CPRS? Or is there no preference?

Dr: Any of the ones that I mentioned that I routinely deal with, blood pressure, glucose weight, pulse oximetry, I would be ok with it going into CPRS as long as it was clearly labeled as patient-generates data.

Interviewer 3: Is there anything else that we should know about related to devices and your experiences with them?

Dr: I can’t think of anything else.

Interviewer 3: Does anyone else have any questions?

Interviewer 2: Two questions: devices that collect vitals or clinical-related data or devices that collect other things, such as steps, is there value in getting that Fitbit data at all? Or just the vitals/clinical stuff?

Dr: I would say that the later is more important to me in making clinical judgments. I feel that we have cracked the but on this, but maybe that information would be useful to me. Maybe steps or how many calories they are during or how much time they spent on exercise, I could certainly potentially see a role for that. If you were collecting that type of Apple Health exercise data and that sort of thing. Certainly, some of these programs. I can’t think of the one that I had on my phone, because I had it to test it out, where you log all your calories. You could even scan the barcode on a particular food item and it actually tells you how many calories that it. That would be interesting for weight loss programs and preventive medicine type programs. 

Interviewer 2: All of that data would be useful. Would you have to see that information as part of the medical record or a summarized result of that. Or an interpretation from a provider saying that I have looked at all of this data and this is what I’ve come up with. Or would you see all of that data going into the medical record? 

Dr: If it was in the medical record where it is not…that is another thing about providers, they don’t want to see a bunch of extra notes, but it is in there in a section that they could access if they wanted it and it is summarized as you said that would be very useful.

Interviewer 2: There is this debate or discussion going on and I think you kind of already answered it. The thought of creating a policy for VHA that no patient-generated dat, including blood pressures and they things that you mentioned, would go into the medical record unless it was reviewed first by a physician and approved or concurred before it went into the medical record.

Dr: What is the reasoning behind not just letting it go in?

Interviewer 2: There are different people that have different opinions. That has been floating around for awhile. Usually it comes from the Office of Connected Care and Virtual Care Manager. They say it a lot. All of the patient-generated data should be reviewed by a provider first and then they should be able to choose what goes into the medical record or now. The reason that I’m asking is because I know that there is already patient-generated data that I know are already automatically going into CPRS. You mentioned some of them, so if they did make that policy, then I think it could make it difficult. A good example is Allen Jacobson’s INR project where all of those patients enter their IRNs and it goes straight into the lab. 

Dr: It is the same thing as the nurse telelhealth. I don’t know if that patient is doing that blood pressure. I don’t know what they have been doing. They might have been running around drinking coffee, then they stick their arm in the health buddy and that is patient-generated data. I think that you’d handcuff yourself if you wrote a policy like that. 

Interviewer 2: thank you.

Interviewer 1: When the health buddy information, how do you get the information? Do you get a report or do you click into CPRS and there is a summary of all the data?

Dr: It is a note in CPRS. It is labeled “nurse telehealth program.” There is some verbiage up there and it will say date range and here is the patient’s perimeters and there is a very nice table with the max and min of each measure and the mean, which is really nice. THen, they will add notes to that too. When the provider orders a nurse telehealth consult, they have to put parameters in. If I say that I want blood pressure monitor, what range am I looking for? So then, when the nurse gets these measurements, if they get something out of range, then they call the patient and they say that “Hi, Mr. so-and-so, your blood pressure is high today, are you feeling ok?” And then they will make notes in there. They will say that the patient is experiencing this or feeling this way, can you follow-up or I’ll get that data and there is no particular complaints, but the blood pressure is high, so I’ll write back to the home telehealth nurse “Tell them to increase their medication to 10 milligrams. Then, they contact them and weeks later I get another notes with the new blood pressure. It is really nice remote management. 

Interviewer 1: How are you alerted that there is a new note for you or that there is new data for you to review? Through the nurse or is there another way?

Dr: It goes into CPRS and they put on it what is called an additional signer, so I get a notification in CPRS that I have an unsigned document and I see that it is that. 

Interviewer 1: Ok, that makes sense.

Interviewer 5: What about ECG data. Apple Watch that little app that lets you record that?

Dr: It might be. I remember seeing something somewhere that that is actually fairly accurate, but I’ve only had a single experience so far, where the watch Wass telling the guy that he was in a-fib and I put an event monitor on him and he wasn’t in a-fib. If those devices are truly accurate, that would be very helpful. If they happen to have one of course, but instead of me ordering an event monitor, then I could go on Apple Watch data. I mean, yeah. Again, if it was accurate enough to capture it.
