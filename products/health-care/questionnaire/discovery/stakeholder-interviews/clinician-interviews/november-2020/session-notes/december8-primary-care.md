# Dec. 8 Primary care physician #

## Key Takeaways ##
- Spends approximately the first ten minutes of each appointment determine why the patient came in today and what they want to get out of the appointment.
- Worried about the timing of mental health questionnaires if a patient complete them on their own before an appointment. Wants to make sure the worsening depression or suicidal ideation is dealt with immediately.
- They do utilize the PHQ-9 and CWT medical clearance questionnaires in their practice as needed. They have no formal pre-visit questionnaire currently in use in their practice.
- Prior to COVID, the nurse/tech would ask about clinical reminders and screening questions prior to seeing the doctor. The physician reviews a note from the nurse/tech, but does a lot of intake questioning as well. 
- Post COVID, the nurse/tech calls the patient prior to the appointment (a few days to a few hours before) to gather that same information. The doctor still reviews a note from the nurse/tech.
- Wants the questionnaire data (or really any patient-generated data) to be easy to get into the medical record. No scan or transcribing the answers in.
- Wants the PGD to be easily sortable or filterable within the medical record. Wants it marked as PGD data - only then would it be ok to automatically enter it. Otherwise, wants to review it and approve what goes into the medical record. Wants historical data to be in an easily accessible location in the record.
- Ideally wants to be able to copy the patient’s answers and place them into a note or another location that is easy to access in the future.
- Would need to see screener scores over time per patient.
- Sees value in the questions we are proposing for MVP and they will help with his interaction with patients. 
- Prioritizes other questionnaires based upon how long they take to fill out. But would prioritize medication reconciliation as the next medical record feature.
- Normally deals with glucometers, blood pressure readings and even EKG from iPhone applications. Also, they find this data the most valuable - data that is actionable based on the patients diagnoses and goals.
- Currently, they receive PGD by patients bringing in the device, writing it on paper, or sending a secure message.

## Interview ##
Interviewer: I'm going to have you talk through different parts of your typical appointment experience. Let us know if there are any big differences based upon appointment type (new patient, follow-up, physical, etc.) What health record information is helpful to review before an appointment? What information would be helpful to have a Veteran review/update ahead of their visit?

Dr: There is definitely a difference between new and returning patients. For the new patients, whenever possible I try to look in JVL and see any VA records to get a sense of their medical history. I like to look at their medication list, problem list, and a couple recent progress notes if they are available as well. The main thing that I look out for is a list of medications, since patients don’t always know them off the top of their head when they come in for a visit. As well as the problems that they want to address during their visit. For patients, who are returning, who I have seen before, there is a little less that I need. I will look at my previous progress notes, medications, my previous assessments and plans, then go from there. In general, patients aren’t asked to prepare anything in particular unless I have asked a patient specifically to come back with a list of blood pressure or sugars/finger stick levels.

Interviewer: How long before seeing the Veteran do/would you open their chart to prepare for their appt.?

Dr: When I first started, I would look a couple of days beforehand, but that has become more and more difficult as we get busier. Typically, now…it is generally right before. I will look following the tech with the screening the patient and getting the initial vital signs and if they happen to get finished a little early, then I’ll start to review those pieces.

Interviewer: Is there information about your patient that you wish you had prior to your appointment?

Dr: It can sometimes be difficult to find things despite this integrated system of the VAs, because if I want vaccinations they are very hard to find…colonoscopies. Being able to pull up the prior radiology from other facilities is also quite difficult to get.

Interviewer: Do you feel you have a personal view of the veteran and what is important to them both medically and lifestyle/family?

Dr: Generally, no. I don’t tend to get that much detail about the intricacies of their life unless I have the time to look at specific progress notes and then it is only if the doctor wrote about it before. 

Interviewer: What about their goals for that particular appointment? Or maybe they lost a job or other stressors?

Dr: Yes, I definitely wish we had more of. Recently, some of the schedulers have made little comments when they schedule, but most often it just says a patient with a hist appointment and that is all I know. 

Interviewer: What systems/accounts do you use?

Dr: Mostly CPRS and often go into JVL.

Interviewer: How long do you typically spend on intake/screening questions?
Dr: You mean personally with the patient?

Interviewer: Yes

Dr: What do you mean by intake or screening questions?

Interviewer: Well, how would you interrupt that?

Dr: I know that in certain clinics patients are given a list of questions to answer before the appointment, so I assume that is what you are referring to. Those are things like “What is your medical history?” Any updates to your health since you last visit, but we don’t have any types of questions like that. The closest to that would be the questions that the health tech goes through the clinical reminders. Those all pepper in as they become relevant to the appointment that we are talking about.

Interviewer: When they are going through the clinical reminders. You mentioned that you don’t get a lot of information about why they are actually there that day. Do they tend to pull that information out too?

Dr: They do not. 

Interviewer: Then during the appointment, you have to spend time doing that work and digging that up?

Dr: yes, exactly. I’d say that the first 10 minutes are me just saying “What can I help you with today? Why are you here? What questions do you have for me?”

Interviewer: Is that the list that you normally tend to ask? Are there any other questions that you ask frequently?

Dr: I always start with “What can I help you with?” Then, that often start the conversation. What questions do you have for me? Do you have any concerns?” I usually have my own plan of what I want to accomplish based on conditions and monitoring and stuff, but a lot will depend upon how many things they have on their list. If I ask “What can I help you with?” And they have a long list, then I try to narrow it down to their top 1 or 2 most important things to start off with, so we don’t run out of time to get to their most important things. 

Interview: You tailor it to whatever is going on with them. So you know if it is a returning patient, you know that they are diabetic, then you add in some questions related to that.

Dr: Correct, but I have always started with what their concerns are first, then if I have to cut them off I will cut them off, then I am more concerned about your diabetes, so I want to talk about that now. 

Interviewer: Are there questions that should only be asked by a clinician and documented vs. having the Veteran provide in an intake form?

Dr: I think that mental health can be a little bit tricky, because they often require follow-up questions to get more detail and determine urgency of what needs to happen next. Otherwise, I don’t see any particular reason why something couldn’t be asked ahead of time, then once they get to me, I could ask clarifying questions if need be. 

Interviewer: Where do you typically document the answers to these intake/screening questions - paper or digital (which section of the EHR)?
Dr: CPRS and the history of present illness.

Interviewer: If you had a magical wand, what would you like to be able to do to maximize your time with your patient?

Dr: Now that is a big question. It is so broad.

Interviewer: Yes, now we are the team looking at a lot of questionnaires and patient-generated data.

Dr: Well, regarding questionnaires and patient-generated data, I feel like there would need to be an easy way to get it into the record system. Into CPRS. If they get a list of questions and they are writing it down on a piece of paper. I don’t want to have to transcribe that into CPRS. Nor do I want to have to scan it and upload, because then it will be impossible to find in the future and get at what you are looking for. That would be my biggest concern before doing things before I can see a patient.

Interviewer: If we can make that happen though, do you think…what would be the impact to your appointments with patients? Would this be helpful? Or not helpful?

Dr: I think that it would be helpful. It would be helpful, so I wouldn’t have to spend the time asking certain questions initially. It could be helpful to prepare for the visit if I knew exactly why they were there before I started talking to them. I think that would be the most helpful thing, which is knowing why they are there and if necessary I could look up something or something that a little harder to do on the fly, then when I’m with the patients.

Interviewer: We heard from Veterans that if they filled out some of these they would be interested in if some of their answers were trigger an idea from the doctor of “Oh, you should get bloodwork or having imaging.” Things like that. What do you think about that?

Dr: Yeah, I think that is great. I think a lot of those concerns come up pretty naturally during an appointment. I’m interested in getting this set of tests done. I do have a list of things that I go through to make sure that they are up-to-date on. Whatever tests or procedures that they need. A lot fo that could depend upon the individual clinician and how they keep track of certain things.

Interviewer: Just to confirm, there is no type of questionnaire that you use at any point during appointments with patients that you see? Not even during or after?

Dr: You mean something that they are given to answer.

Interviewer: Generally, no. For certain cases, such as we are going a PHQ-9 for depression screening. I will often just read off the questions to them rather then give them the questionnaire. There is something called the CWT medical clearance form that they do receive the questionnaire, but after they get the questionnaire done, I need up typing their answers into the computer anyway, so sometimes it is easier to just go through the questions one-by-one as we are talking. 

Interviewer: You mentioned those and general intake questions, how would you prioritize those for which ones you would want to make digital?

Dr: It would depend upon what questions about being asked. I would prioritize mostly on how long it would take to get those answers into the system. The CWT is maybe 10-15 questions, so I might take that over something like “Why are you here?”, which is only one question.

Interviewer: You already mentioned that you think mental health would be tricky, but are there any other types of questions that you would not want digitized?

Dr: No, I don’t think so.

Interviewer: In your ideal world, how would you want this to work?

Dr: In an ideal world, after the patients answers the questions, there should be a screen or window that would come up with the answers that I could copy (if I wanted to) into a note or copy them to place that it is easily accessible for the future. I think about these things in a two categories: one where I see it now and I make a decision, then I don’t need it anymore. Or something that I’m going to need in an archive and reference many months or years down the road. There has to be an easy way to have access to it. 

Interviewer: When would you want to see questionnaire responses over time for one patient? Or would you ever need to see questionnaire responses across patients.

Dr: I probably wouldn’t ever need to see questionnaire responses across patients unless it was for a research study. In terms of the first question, things that I am trending, I would need to have access to over time, so that could be things that come up with a score. For example, if you did mental health (a PHQ-9) gives me a score and I may want to track over time. Dementia questionnaires is another example of one that I would want to see over time. Something like the patient’s blood pressure, diabetes, those become less relative after I made a specific medication changes, so that would be something that I just need to see at that appointment and make a decision. Then, it isn’t as relative after that. 

Interviewer: Reviews the three questions in the current interface for feedback.

Are there any additional details you’d like to share with your provider about this appointment?
Are there any other concerns or changes in your life that are affecting you or your health? (For example, a marriage, divorce, new baby, change in your job, or other medical conditions)
Do you have a question you want to ask your provider? Please enter your most important question first.

Dr: I like those.

Interviewer: Would those potentially be valuable to your practice and your interactions?

Dr: Yeah and each of those are helpful in a different way. The first question is just getting more data and what they want. That is similar to me asking “What can I help you with?” I like the second question, because it gives me more insight into what is going on in their life and they may not necessarily think to bring up unless specifically asked about, so how helpful that is might vary, but I would be interested to see how they answer that just in case there is something that is relative to that. 

Interviewer: The last one is… Do you have a question you want to ask your provider? Please enter your most important question first.

Dr: That will definitely help in terms of prioritizing at the beginning of the visit and setting expectations to whether we are able to cover all of their questions or not. Then deciding in what order to go in.

Interviewer: Questionnaires are just one type of patient-generated data. I’m going to move onto devices, but before I do. I wanted to open up to the team if they had any other questions for you about questionnaires.

Interviewer 2: How has your interactions with Veterans changed with the pandemic? Specifically, more in mind with how you interact with them virtually versus in-person.

Dr: We are definitely doing more virtual appointments. In general, we are still able to accomplish what we usually accomplish with telehealth compared to face-to-face for the most part. There is a little bit less casual conversation when we are on the phone when face-to-face, because you feel like they are there to accomplish something compared to just sitting around and chatting.

Interviewer 2: If a patient came into the office face-to-face, is there things that you do or your nurses that you can’t do virtually? For instance, some of the things that we heard from Veterans is that with virtual appointments they lost that interaction with the nurses prior to the doctor getting into the room, so is there a different way that you are handling that? Or you always went out and got the Veteran and there was no nurse interaction.

Dr: We are keeping it pretty similar as face-to-face. In face-to-face, the tech takes their vitals and asks the screening questions. Now, we are having them call the patient ahead of time and going through those same questions. Of course, they can’t get the vital signs, because they aren’t face-to-face. But we are asking the questions. And not necessarily right before the appointment, perhaps a day before or a few hours before the appointment. I sometimes wonder if the patients know that is who that is when we call and that may be one reason why they feel that they are missing out on that. It is also…not necessarily the same person that they are talking to each time. Normally in person, it is the same tech that has been assigned to a doctor for years, but now that we’ve gone virtual it may be a different person who is calling them ahead of time to go through those screening questions.

Interviewer 2: It might not be your specific facility. We talked to Veterans all across the US, so it might be a different facility that they are missing out on that particular portion of it, so would the tech or nurse type in the same information as if it was face-to-face?

Dr: Yes. 

Interviewer: So you are essentially reviewing a note before you talk to them?

Dr: Correct.

Interviewer 3: You are supportive of the first couple of questions that we have in our questionnaire. You would prioritize other questionnaires based upon how long they take you to fill out. If we were to add in any other medical record information, are there any highlights that come to mind that we could prioritize? You mentioned med list.

Dr: Definitely med list, I would prioritize. If there were changes to medications, any outside medications, or confirming that they are taking all their medication or that what they are taking is the same as what we have in our system. Right now, I’m having the techs try to do that beforehand, but it isn’t always easy to get a good medication reconciliation. Other then that, in terms of initial…Nothing is really coming to mind. I suppose some of the questions to medication allergies that is important. That is something that we don’t want to miss. Recent hospitalizations, urgent care visits would be good to know about those as well. 

Interviewer: What types of patient-generated data do you encounter in your practice? This includes any data provided by the patient from outside a healthcare encounter, including pre-visit questionnaires, wearable device data, other device data (e.g., CPAP), etc.

Dr: The most common devices that I see are finger sticks from glucometers, blood pressure readings, even once in a while I see EKG tracings from those new iPhone applications. 

Interviewer: Anything else from Fitbit or Apple Health?

Dr: Rarely. Occasionally, I’ll have someone who says (I have my number of steps and they’ll show me on the phone and it isn’t as helpful.

Interviewer: Of all the patient generated data that you use/encounter, how would you prioritize your usage of them and why?

Dr: I would prioritize the data that affects the treatment plan or affected by any medication that they patient is on. Blood pressure and sugar would be at the top of my priorities. I’ve seen some sleep information from Fitbits and such and those are lower down, because it is harder to know what to do with that data. 

Interviewer: Of the ones that you find useful, are they prescribed by you or BYO?

Dr: Mostly prescribed devices. All the glucometers and blood pressure cuffs are prescribed. I mean they can get them on their own, but the VA provides them. The EKG tracing one I have found to be quite useful, but only in specific cases, when you need to catch a patients rhythm at a specific time.

Interviewer: How do you access this data and interact with this data? What challenges are there?

Dr: They usually either bring it in or write it down on a piece of paper and bring the paper in and sometimes those numbers…some of the more tech-savvy Veterans will send those numbers to me in a secure message.

Interviewer: I definitely wanted to ask about secure messaging as well. How often do people send you that type of information or add documents for you to review through secure messaging?

Dr: It is definitely the minority of patients. If I had to put a number to it. I would say maybe 5 messages a week or some record of data from somewhere else that the patient wants me to review. 

Interviewer: You mentioned how this information is variable in how helpful it is. Can you talk more about that? How does this information impact your interactions with the patient and their quality of care?

Dr: The most useful data is directly related to something that we are working on in terms of their health. In terms of diabetes, the patient has a specific goal in mind and I have a specific goal in mind and we have specific medications that can take away or add to directly affect that number. so it is really helpful when it is a direct link between the numbers that we are seeing and that there is something that we can do about it. Same with blood pressure. When I talked about the EKG tracing, it was specifically helpful when the patients had a particular symptom that we were trying to work up. They wanted to know what the heart was doing at that specific time and we were able to see what the tracing looked like when he felt those palpitations. 

Interviewer: Are there types of PGD from devices you wish you could better/more access to?

Dr: I think we have pretty good access to those devices. This is a completely different topic, but there are problems with glucometer replacements at our particular VA. I don’t know if that is the case at other VA. You are allowed to give the initial glucometer, but if they break it or lose it, then they have to come back and try to go through the warranty process for a replacement (30:25). Even if it has been 10-20 years and that is difficult to do.

Interviewer: Are there types of PGD from devices that you don’t need or want access to?

Dr: I’ll never say no if someone has something that they want to show me. I’m always happy to take a look at it. Like the number of steps they take. That can be helpful if they have a goal and they are trying to get a certain number of steps. But if they are recording the data and not acting on it, then it doesn’t help at all. 

Interviewer: It all goes back to their diagnoses and their goals. Then, the devices for that and the data that they report with those things.

Dr: Yes.

Interviewer: Do you review self reported data from myHealtheVet, what does that data look like for you?

Dr: No. 

Interviewer: In a perfect world, how would the PGD you interact with be presented to you? In what system or form?

Dr: I certainly want to be able to sort and filter the data. I want to confirm accuracy to. To just make sure that it is useful to keep in the official CPRS record. I want to be able to transfer it over to CPRS, so I won’t have to keep going back to the patient-generated data if it is something that I want to keep track of.

Interviewer: What type of patient generated data would you like to go directly into CPRS? What type of data would you like to review first before entering or submitting to CPRS? Or no preference?

Dr: What types are there?

Interviewer: Like things that you mentioned today. Questionnaire or device.

Dr: I don’t think that I would want anything to go in automatically without my review first. One, because I don’t want to be overwhelmed with data. One problem that I sometimes encounter with the home telehealth and the monitoring is that the data getting transferring to CPRS, is that I’ll get 30 blood pressures and they are all exactly the same. I’ll be going through months and months of data and the numbers are fine and there is nothing to do about it. It is a waste of time. I also want to see if there are any abnormalities before they go in, so they can be address, instead of it going in and I miss it. 

Interviewer: What if we could differentiate between PGD and data that was generated in the healthcare system?

Dr: That could potentially help. If there was a way to differentiate it and filter based off of it. I wouldn’t want it to add extra clicks or extra time to load if that was the case though. 

Interviewer: I’m going to open it up to the rest of the group to see if they have any other questions.

Interviewer 2: When patient bring in their sugar level reading and their blood pressure in various different ways, what do you do with that after they bring it in. 

Dr: It depends. If that information were important, then I would have transcribed it into my notes, then I’ll shred or throw out the actual paper. Sometimes, I’ll transcribe just the relevant parts, then I’ll scan the paper and attach it to the note. Sometimes, I’ll just give it back to the patient too.

Interviewer 2: Do you actually enter…for instance, if they brought in readings for two weeks, either their blood pressure or sugar level do you type in actual data for the two weeks?

Dr: yes, sometimes I do.

Interviewer 2: Oh wow!

Dr: yeah, it is a pain. I use my judgment if I need to type it in. If it is a particularly complex patient that I want to be able to look back at the primary data, so I can follow my train of thought, then I’ll definitely type it in fully. Sometimes, I’ll just say that your sugars have been 100-120s and I’ll leave it at that. It all depends upon what my plan is and how much I have to change their medications based upon that.

Interviewer 2: For patients that you are requesting these readings, what would be if you had a magic wand, if you had it your way, what would that look like to you?

Dr: I want to be able to copy the data into CPRS and format it in such a way that it is easy to read, so whether it is …for the sugars, I want to group the readings by fasting, before lunch, before dinner, at bedtime. It would be great if there was a way to combine that data with the patients insulin regime. I could see at this time they took this amount and their reading was this and the following time the next day, it was so and so. Being able to organize and format the data is very important and getting it a way that is easy to read. 

Interviewer 2: Because right now it is just a text note in CPRS.

Dr: I end up doing a lot of tabbing and trying to create columns.

Interviewer 2: What if you didn’t even have to type it in? 

Dr: I love that.

Interviewer: What if we allowed the patient to do all of that before they come in and see you?

Dr: Perfect. Excellent.

Interviewer: You said blood glucose, blood pressure, anything else on the list. What would you scope as things that you want them to enter before the appointment at home?

Dr: Things like blood pressure and blood glucose and any of the home measurements that we are tracking are what I’m interested in. For glucose, I would want to know the time as it relates to their time of their meals and when they take their insulin. For their blood pressure, it would be good to know what time they took the blood pressure. It might be too much to ask, but it would be good to know what were you doing before you took it? Were you sitting? Which arm did you check it in? Those are less important, but could be helpful if it isn’t too onerous for them to input.

Interviewer: What about blood oxygen?

Dr: I haven’t have a lot of patients that I monitor blood oxygen for. The only people that we need to monitor are COVID patients or COPD patients that are on supplemental oxygen at home. For that, I would need to know their oxygen level and how many liters of oxygen they are on. Is it a face mask or a CPAP device? 

Interviewer: But due to volume of patients, you would rank the other ones higher? What about weight?

Dr: So definitely for patients that have CHF, heart failure and we are monitoring their weight for volume status purposes that would be helpful. That I would like to know how many milligrams of their water pill that they are taking, what time they are taking that. And if they took any extras, because sometimes we have them take extras if their weight goes up be a certain amount. I wouldn’t want weights for someone that we are monitoring for obesity or weight loss That is too many numbers for not much change.

Interviewer: What about sleep?

Dr: That is an interesting question, because I never really had access to that kind of data before. So I suppose sleep data can tell us how long it takes them to fall asleep and how many awakenings they had. (42:02) That would be something that I would be interested in for an initial evaluation if someone if someone is coming to me for the first time for a sleep complaint. Because we don’t have a lot of treatment options for sleep, having that information on a continual basis be not be very helpful.

Interviewer: The other bucket is activity/active minutes per day.

Dr: Yeah, that…I think that data. I might be interested as an aggregated number, rather than a day by day type of thing. More as a counseling or motivation point for patients. On average, they had these numbers of steps that they did instead of specific day to day numbers. 

Interviewer 4; What about mental health data? I know that providers ask about this due to the COVID situation, would that data be of relevance?

Dr: It could. I mentioned this before, but you have to be very careful when that data is collected. If it is done immediately before an appointment, it could help us save time, but I wouldn’t want those questions to be asked if there was no immediate follow-up available. The concern being if there was severe worsening of depression or suicidual ideation, then we would need to have a plan in place to get that addressed right away.

Interviewer: That could be a questionnaire. Would you want to review that information immediately before or do you think that would be a use case for reviewing things earlier.

Dr: A use case for the patient to complete it in the waiting room or if they would do it right before I call then, if it was a phone call.

Interviewer 4: What challenges do you face today when it coming to integrating PGD with lab results or in-patient monitoring or stuff like that.

Dr: I mentioned the challenge of transcribing and getting it into the system is one of the major issues. The second is putting it in a place that we have access to in the future if we are trending. Right now, there is no section in CPRS where we can look at historical patient data. I think that is the second major challenge.

Interviewer 4: What about analyzing that data from CPRS? Is that something that is done manually? Especially if you have large qualities of data coming thorough for a patient.

Dr: Most of the data that I’ve experienced haven’t been huge amounts. That is mostly because it is the patient themselves who are collecting it and writing it down, but definition. They are unable to get more than I’m able to read, so has been an issue with the home health. I kind of have to scan through and look for trends, but so far nothing has been overwhelming with analyzing the data. In fact, the opposite has been the problem. Not having enough data is more of the issue that we generally have these days.

Interviewer 2: When you say home telehealth, is that the health buddy?

Dr: No, I don’t know what the health buddy is actually.

Interviewer 2: We talked to another provider and they use the health buddy, which is why I was wondering if they were the same. What is the home telehealth?

Dr: We have a home telelhealth office and they will mail out to the patient a device that will either measure blood pressure or sugar levels and then it transmit the data to that home telehealth office and then they have a nurse that calls the patient if they see any abnormalities or once a month they call the patient and check in, then they write up a note and add all the details. Then, they add me as the co-signer to it. They will provide some counseling and as a way to inform the doctor if there are any abnormalities in the data that they are collecting.

Interviewer 2: I’m assuming that you would prescribe that service.

Dr: In general, yes, but there are some patients that get prescribed it on their own. I’m not sure how that happens. That does become a problem, because then I end up with data that I don’t want or need.
