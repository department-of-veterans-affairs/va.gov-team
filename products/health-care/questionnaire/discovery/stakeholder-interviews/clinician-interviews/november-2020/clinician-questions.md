# Questions for Clinician Interviews 

## Research goals
Understand how clinicians want to access and interact with Patient-Generated Data (PGD) within their workflows, particularly questionnaires. 

## Hypotheses 
- Clinicians are most interested in seeing “high yield” PGD, i.e. PGD that will influence clinical decision-making and is backed by evidence. 
- Clinicians are wary of seeing PGD that does not have a clear influence on clinical decision making and/or is not clearly backed by evidence, given liability issues and information overload. 
- Clinicians want PGD to be “integrated” into the electronic health record workflow: 
   - Don’t have to open a separate app 
   - Don’t have to log in twice 
   - Don’t have to re-search for the patient within the PGD system – it maintains patient context with the electronic health record 
   - Want to access/be presented with PGD easily at point of decision making 
- Clinicians want to be able to differentiate between PGD and data that was generated in the healthcare system (e.g., home blood pressure readings vs. clinic blood pressure readings)

## Background, Basic Workflow and Warm-up Questions
1. What is your background? Training level, specialty, practice setting

2. I'm going to have you talk through different parts of your typical appointment experience. Let us know if there are any big differences based upon appointment type (new patient, follow-up, physical, etc.)
   - First, how do you prepare for the appointment?
     - What health record information is helpful to review before an appointment?
         - How long before seeing the Veteran do/would you open their chart to prepare for their appt.?
     - What information would be helpful to have a Veteran review/update ahead of their visit?
     - Is there information about your patient that you wish you had prior to your appointment?
         - Do you feel you have a personal view of the veteran and what is important to them both medically and lifestyle/family?
     - What systems/accounts do you use?
     - What does your work station look like? How many monitors, etc?
     
3. Next, we will talk about during and after the appointment.   
   - How long do you typically spend on intake/screening questions?
   - What are the standard questions you're required to ask Veterans?
   - Are there questions that you like to regularly include that are not in the clinical documentation?
   - Are there questions that should only be asked by a clinician and documented vs. having the Veteran provide in an intake form? 
       - if yes, which ones and why?
   - Do you utilize any different systems/accounts during or after the appointment? 
       - Where do you typically document the answers to these intake/screening questions - paper or digital (which section of the EHR)?
    - Do you typically find the reason for visit documented from the scheduling solution matches the verbal description the veteran provides why they are there. ie. Chief Complaint?
       - Would you want the patient stated reason for visit to populate the Chief Complaint in your clinical note - if you could/add to it?
    - If you had to summarize the top 3-5 areas Veterans routinely want to discuss with you and their Dr. what would they be?
    - If you had a magical wand, what would you like to be able to do to maximize your time with your patient?

4. What types of patient-generated data do you encounter in your practice? This includes any data provided by the patient from outside a healthcare encounter, including pre-visit questionnaires, wearable device data, other device data (e.g., CPAP), etc. 
   - Of all the patient generated data that you use/encounter, how would you prioritize your usage of them and why?


## Questionnaire-based Questions   
5. Do your patients fill out any forms or questionnaires?
   - If yes...
     - What forms or questionnaires do they fill out?
     - Are these questionnaires used by the nationally, VAMC, specific to your clinic, or specific to your patients?
     - Do these questionnaires differ based upon new or returning patients?
     - Do you feel more, less, or equally prepared for your appointments with patients, because of these questionnaires? 
     - Do you refer to this information at other points than right before or during an appointment?
     - When do Veterans complete the questionnaire (before, during, and/or after the appointment)?
         - How far in advance of an appointment do you send questionnaires to the patients?
         - How is the patient notified that they have a questionnaire to complete?
     - Do your patients complete the questionnaires via paper, electronically, or verbally?
         - Are nurses or office administrators involved in the process?
               - How does the nurse communicate this information to you before an appointment?
         - How do you organize/store information provided by the patient?
         - Do you have an easily accessible view of questionnaire answers (current or past) to reference?
         - Do you use eScreening, Virtual Care Manager, or any other questionnaire products?
               - If yes, what are your impressions of those systems?
      - Do you notice the answers change frequently from the last visit when the Veteran was asked the questions?
      - How is the patient notified that they have a questionnaire to complete?
   - If no, why not?
      - What types of questionnaires might you be interested in incorporating into your practice?
      - Are there types of PGD from questionnaires that you deinitely don’t need or want access to? 
      - How could you imagine this information impacting your interactions with the patient and their quality of care?
   - If you had your wish, would you do things differently or how would you do things differently?
   - Do any offices that you frequently refer patients to have pre-appointment digital forms/experiences that you know of?

6. Do you use secure messaging with patients in your practice?
   - Do you have the ability to add documents from a message to the patient's chart?
   - If a veteran had a question about an intake form ahead of a visit would sending a secure message/text/call to the clinic be preferred?
   
7. Would you review a clinical note in a patients chart with questionnaire answers before meeting with the patient?
   - When would you want to see data from questionnaires across patients versus for only one patient?
      
8. Do you have experience creating questionnnaires?
   - If yes...
      - How do you create a questionnaire (pull from a template or create your own)?
      - What is your clinic's ability to make custom versus standardized questionnaires?
      
## Device-based Questions
9. Do you routinely have your patients send you data from devices, such as blood pressure monitors, CPAP machines, glucometers, mobile apps, wearable devices, etc?
   - If yes... 
      - From what particular devices?
      - Are they prescribed by you or BYO?
      - How do you access this data and interact with this data? What challenges are there?
      - How does this information impact your interactions with the patient and their quality of care?
      - What other devices might you be interested in reviewing information from?
      - Of the following device data, which would you find useful to review as part of standard care: activity, stress, sleep, resting heart rate, active minutes / day, blood glucose, blood oxygen, blood pressure, weight, etc.
      - Are there types of PGD from devices you wish you could better/more access to? 
      - Are there types of PGD from devices that you don’t need or want access to? 
   - If no...
      - Why not?
      - What devices or information types might you be most interested incorporating into your practice?
      - Of the following device data, which would you find useful to review as part of standard care: activity, stress, sleep, resting heart rate, active minutes / day, blood glucose, blood oxygen, blood pressure, weight, etc.
      - Are there types of PGD from devices that you deinitely don’t need or want access to?

# Clinician Recruitment Plan
- Dr. Derek Juang, San Diego and possibly other San Diego colleagues
- VA in Durham, NC
- Can we talk to Lauryl (Lighthouse researcher) about who she talked to with questionnaire experience in her PGD study, so we can talk to those people too?
