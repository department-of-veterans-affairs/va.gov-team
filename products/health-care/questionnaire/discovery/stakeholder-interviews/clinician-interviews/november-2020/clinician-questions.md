# Questions for Clinician Interviews 

1. To start, I'm going to have you talk through different parts of your typical appointment experience. Let us know if there are any big differences based upon appointment type (new patient, follow-up, physical, etc.)
   - First, how do you prepare for the appointment?
     - What health record information is helpful to review before an appointment?
         - How long before seeing the Veteran do/would you open their chart to prepare for their appt.?
     - What information would be helpful to have a Veteran review/update ahead of their visit?
     - Is there information about your patient that you wish you had prior to your appointment?
         - Do you feel you have a personal view of the veteran and what is important to them both medically and lifestyle/family?
         - Is there anything that you like patients to do before their appointment like lab tests, medical imaging, answer questions, etc?
     - What systems/accounts do you use?
     - What does your work station look like? How many monitors, etc?
   - Next, we will talk about during and after the appointment?   
     - How long do you typically spend on intake/screening questions?
     - What are the standard questions you're required to ask Veterans?
     - Are there questions that you like to regularly include that are not in the clinical documentation?
     - Are there questions that should only be asked by a clinician and documented vs. having the Veteran provide in an intake form? 
         - if yes, which ones and why?
     - Do you utilize any different systems/accounts during or after the appointment? 
         - Where do you typically document the answers to these intake/screening questions - paper or digital (which section of the EHR)?
      - Do you typically find the reason for visit documented from the scheduling soluiton matches the verbial description the veteran provides why they are there. ie. Chief Complaint?
         - Would you want the patient stated reason for visit to populate the Chief Complaint in your clinical note - if you could/add to it?
      - If you had to summarize the top 3-5 areas Veterans routinely want to discuss with you and their Dr. what would they be?
      - If you had a magical wand, what would you like to be able to do to maximize your time with your patient?

   - If yes...
     - What forms or questionnaires do they fill out?
     - Do you have an easily accessible view of questionnaire answers (current or past) to reference?
     - Do you use eScreening, Virtual Care Manager, or any other questionnaire products?
         - If yes, what are your impressions of those systems?
     - Do these questionnaires differ based upon new or returning patients?
     - Do you feel more, less, or equally prepared for your appointments with patients, because of these questionnaires? 
     - Do you refer to this information at other points than right before or during an appointment?
     - Do your patients complete the questionnaires via paper, electronically, or verbally?
         - Do you notice the answers change frequently from the last visit when the Veteran was asked the questions?
         - Are nurses or office administrators involved in the process?
               - How does the nurse communicate this information to you before an appointment?

3. Do you see patients via telehealth appointments?

   - Do you have the ability to add documents from a message to the patient's chart?
   - If a veteran had a question about an intake form ahead of a visit would sending a secure message/text/call to the clinic be preferred?

5. If a Veteran enters self reporting data in myHealtheVet, what does that data look like for you? How does it appear in the EHR or some other system?
   
5. Do you regularly review any other form of patient submitted data besides questionnaires?
    - Where do you go to access/view information you receive from patients? 
    - Would you like patient generated information sent directly to the EHR?

      - What is your clinic's ability to make custom versus standardized questionnaires?
      
      
# Clinician Recruitment Plan
- Dr. Derek Juang, San Diego and possibly other San Diego colleagues
- VA in Durham, NC
- Can we talk to Lauryl (Lighthouse researcher) about who she talked to with questionnaire experience in her PGD study, so we can talk to those people too?
