- [TOT July 28th](https://drive.google.com/open?id=15UHjA9J7bo_oJg3rbqaJq2gsjXexLyF5)

**Research and Design**
- Created [Research Plan for upcoming Veteran Testing of MVP](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/11544)

**Engineering**
- Engineering to continue research API/interface feeds into EHR's, MPI, CMS
- [Sprint 26 Demo - Forms Unaut-Auth Prototype ](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vft-59c95ae5fda7577a9b3184f8/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/10714)


**Next Step/Followup**
- Hold Discovery Sprint Readout with Leads and Stakeholders 
- Continue Initiative documentation for Q3 priority features 
- Priority Feature Planning for sprint 28
- User Testing Started
- Design to prototype in new tool and build mock conditional logic app for demonstration purposes.
- VAOS/CPRS tech investigation and recommendations complete
	
**Decisions:**
-  Due to BE Engineering work for the Facilities team did not stay as low as expected, there is now a need for Lance to support. Since we have Laurence on board now, Lance can return to facilities full time. Paul Short, our engineering lead, will now play a more hands on support role with Laurence/healthcare as Laurence ramps up (both as a mentor/coach and in support of the team). Paul will also be able to determine during this time if and when your team may need additional BE support 

**Blockers:**
- No changes in status from previous week for blockers [Paper - Current State Workflows #10219](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/10219) and [Stakeholder Interviews #11037](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/11037)

- Backlog Planning for Sprint 27 on Wednesday 22nd.

**Research and Design**

- [Created a Journey Map](https://app.mural.co/t/vsa8243/m/vsa8243/1595002246550/dcc8f89e70628bfb9f123075ff514189005fa17c) based on each Persona 
- Created a [sketch of an Experience Map](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C0136TS768M/p1595609704127400?thread_ts=1595602052.126000&cid=C0136TS768M) 
- Initial draft of [Clinical Stakeholder Key Findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/questionnaire/discovery/stakeholder-interviews/clinician-interviews/key-findings.md) 

**Engineering**

- Completed the [Technical Feasibility Document](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vft-59c95ae5fda7577a9b3184f8/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/11027) and Scheduled a review with the team for next week. 
- Started Research on Vista and CMS (Drupal) integration
-  Researching authentication gaps with Lighthouse and va.gov 

**Next Step/Followup**
	
- Product to draft MVP Initiatives for remaining Q3 sprints
	- continue to add detail to OKR's
- Hold Discovery Sprint Readout with Leads and Stakeholders 
- Engineering to continue research API/interface feeds into EHR's, MPI, CMS
	- Present authentication prototype at Sprint 26 demo. 
- Design to prototype in new tool and build mock conditional logic app for demonstration purposes.

**Decisions:**
-   Move forward with MVP user-stories based on initial set of clinical stakeholder sessions to get an early prototype of a pre-visit questionnaire live but potentially not active use by Veterans and care team. 
	- The initiatives and featues selected in this prototype are capabilities that are known will be needed once we land our end goal product strategy.
	- The risk here is that we will build a early prototype that may need changes once we have additional stakeholder input, curret state intake documents, and standardized intake documentation created for EHR transition. 
	- The up-side is we will learn allot and have working code for demonstartion of a vision to get buy in for a broad strategy. 
	- We are targeting this initial MVP prototype to be available early Q4 2020. 

**Blockers:**
-  [Paper - Current State Workflows #10219](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/10219) 
	- Continue to identify contacts that can provide standardized forms 

- [Stakeholder Interviews #11037](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/11037)
	- Patrick is following up with contacts he has across a few regions to see if they would be willing to participate and provide us time for interviews and engagement going forward.
