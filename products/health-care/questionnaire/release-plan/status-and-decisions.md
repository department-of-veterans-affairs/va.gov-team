**Decisions:**
-  Due to BE Engineering work for the Facilities team did not stay as low as expected, there is now a need for Lance to support. Since we have Laurence on board now, Lance can return to facilities full time. Paul Short, our engineering lead, will now play a more hands on support role with Laurence/healthcare as Laurence ramps up (both as a mentor/coach and in support of the team). Paul will also be able to determine during this time if and when your team may need additional BE support

**Next Step/Followup**
	
- Product to draft MVP Initiatives for remaining Q3 sprints

- Engineering to continue research API/interface feeds into EHR's, MPI, CMS
	- Present authentication prototype at Sprint 26 demo. 
- Design to prototype in new tool and build mock conditional logic app for demonstration purposes.

**Decisions:**
-   Move forward with MVP user-stories based on initial set of clinical stakeholder sessions to get an early prototype of a pre-visit questionnaire live but potentially not active use by Veterans and care team. 
	- The initiatives and featues selected in this prototype are capabilities that are known will be needed once we land our end goal product strategy.
	- The risk here is that we will build a early prototype that may need changes once we have additional stakeholder input, curret state intake documents, and standardized intake documentation created for EHR transition. 
	- The up-side is we will learn allot and have working code for demonstartion of a vision to get buy in for a broad strategy. 
	- We are targeting this initial MVP prototype to be available early Q4 2020.
