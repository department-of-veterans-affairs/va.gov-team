3/13/24 meeting w/Andy and Andrea

**General Questions (10-7959f-2)**:

- If the Veteran can’t cash that their reimbursement check in the country where they’re located, are there resources to help them figure out how to cash it?
  - They reach out and complain - we say sorry (message) - especially in countries like Japan, Australia that have done away with this
  - Have to est acct with domestic institution and have your checks deposited
  - Workaround - less than ideal, not well received
  - We help them connect the dots, but we’re stuck right now unfortunately
- For the purposes of this form, is the mailing address or physical address more important?
   - Mailing - checks go there
- Is the mailing address always for the Veteran, or can it sometimes be for the provider (e.g., if the provider is the one being paid)?
   - Majority get reimbursed to providers (will be irrelevant once we have an EFT solution)
   - It’s technical and bureaucratic, fragmented, siloed, ‘ugly and brutal’
   - No one central place
- What are the most common reasons a claim might be rejected?
   - Insufficient information, not service connected
   - Appropriations Act passed the other week - expanded authority for 3 - micronesia, palau, marshall islands - officials are interested - advancing national interests in the defense arena
   - Using FMP - expanding for all medical requirements
   - If here in America and 50% or more for scc, they would be covered
   - Now have expanded authority - expecting more pushback now that this is happening
   - Complexities with dealing with this on an international level - at the whims and mercies of our authorities that are being elected
   - Working with legislative implementation team to figure this out 
   - Increased scope but not able to increase efficiency in procedural sense, no extra staff
- What, if anything, is most commonly missing from a claims form that you need to process it?
   - Runs the gamut
   - Not clear on what the diagnosis is or what’s being treated
   - Treating service connected disability - a lot of times intl providers don’t submit with diagnosis, cpt codes to know what is clearly being treated - handwritten, illegible not clear what is being done
   - We have to connect the dots
   - Make it easy for them to obtain service - by design - have looked at to try to standardize, but there would be pushback/heavy lift
   - Standard rejection codes (on EOB), send back letters providing feedback
   - Usually not authorized for scc or insufficient info
   - Established escalation team - for people who reach back out
   - Patient advocacy dept - network that is domestically based, let them know they can log into AVA and ask questions up front. Mostly pple who live overseas. They look at letter upfront and then send to provider - as long as they bill appropriately and they don’t tack stuff up front, it will be covered. 
   - Call center - first line of defense, don’t have capability for support
   - Escalation team (Dirk) has ability to do deeper research, assistance, support/analysis
   - Call center - Brian Guenther
- What are the most common reasons for an escalation?
   - What’s the status of my claim? #1 question –  130 some odd days out for processing claims
   - After adjudication, the paper check is issued around the world
   - Biggest issue - you don’t cover my scc or why didn’t you cover it? Transparency aspect
   - Payments (top 2) (and not having EFT)
- Can they provide multiple claims under the same cover sheet or do they have to do a new cover sheet every time?
   - They do multiple sometimes - we don’t reject because of that
   - Even if we get a claim without a sheet, we’ll process as long as we have the necessary info 
   - Doesn’t guarantee that it’s not fraudulent 
   - Can’t think of a reason why we wouldn’t want pple to submit under one cover sheet - would take a claims processors longer to process if there’s a bunch, but we deal with large ones all the time
   - If it’s done, send it as soon as it’s complete (episode of care)
   - The claims sheet is administrative in nature
   - This stuff happened, I’m validating and you pay me or the provider
   - ‘Meat and potatoes’ is in the supporting docs themselves
- What kind of confirmation do folks get that their claim is being covered - just the check? Do they get a processing notification?
   - one of the chief complaints - it’s just a black hole
   - You get an EOB and it comes with check or rejection
- If they send by email to FMP - hac.fmp@va.gov email - inbox (call center) - they get an auto reply - received, how far out FMP is processing claims. This is updated weekly (manually).
   - Separate email box for the Philippines - provider emails, we respond right away, if something is missing, we email them back so they don’t have to wait
