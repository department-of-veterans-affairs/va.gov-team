## P4 
Notetaker: Hieu Vo

**Introduction**
- Notes

**Warm-up Questions**
- TDIU is 100%, but the regular rate is 90% SC
- Received compensation benefit from VA
- Heard FMP from Reddit, similar to "our program" when you're out of the country.
- On a mobile device (Apple)

**First Task - Intro Page**
- It works differently from their typical benefit. "I don't get bill, they just bill the VA".
- "That was the only thing that I saw different".
- Would "get started" right away and get the support documents
- "a heads up on what I need" with all the support documents.
- Information clarity rating; 5/5 self explanotary.
- "They basically explained what you have to do."

**Second Task - Direct Deposit Static Page**
- "I don't think I have used the Financial Service Center before."
- "I'm not sure what the PIV is."
- FSC Vendor; P4 doesn't have to deal with it, so I'm not familiar with it.
- Did not recall signing up for FSC.
- Noted p4 had direct deposit from benefit transfer since 2011 and was probably transferred over during the ID.me
- Note that they need to read up on FSC.
- Instruction rating: 3/5 since they have no experience with some of the terminologies. 

**Pause Page - Comparison Question**
- "I think it will be different."
- That site and vendor process that they have to go through, I never had to go there. I never had to go offsite.

**Third Task - FMP Form Flow and Upload**
- Veteran vs Provider selection; clearly explain the two different directions.
- Uploading document; "self explanatory", you would want all of your money back, so you want proof of everything.
- Review page: two mailing addresses (mockup quirk).
- Noticed that the "send payment to: Veteran mailing address" is used when the earlier option has direct deposit.
- If bank, P4 would want the last four numbers of the bank account. 

**Fourth Task - Confirmation Page**
- Would screenshot or print it for own record.
- Expects a status page for you to go through.
- If the status page exists, they would check out it frequency if it is something they're expecting. But since the FMP is 90 days, they would check it every weeks.
- If it is taking to long, P4 would contact the provided number.
- Rating of 4/5 due to the unfamiliarity of the FSC/ Vendor information.
- Nothing would stop the participant from filing today. 

**Fifth Task - Content Comprehension & Mental Model**
- understanding of FMP process: as long as you follow your steps, submit the document, and have proof, it should be easy.
- one change: the Vendor Information, because they have no experience dealing with it. It would be helpful to have a representative walk you through it.
- If they see a Claim Status Page, they would be confident that they would get paid.
- Without Status Page, expects email and mail. If more urgent, I want a phone call for a quicker resolution. 

**Post-Task Interview**
- Notes

**Additional Notes**
- P5 thought the FMPflow was 'self-explanatory' and expects to get paid if the user follows the steps and submits the correct documents.
- P5 expressed multiple times how unfamiliar they are with the FSC/ Vendor Information and how it is different from the process they're used to.
- P5 expects a Status Page indicating where they are in the process, and the Status Page would give them confidence when they'll get paid.
