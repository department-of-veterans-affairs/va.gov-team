**Introduction**
- Consents to recording session and video clips (re-confirms consent at the end of the call)

**Warm-up Questions**
- Has SCD rating (100%)
- Receives direct deposit for monthly payment
- Has heard of FMP before
- Registered for FMP
- In their own words: If I'm outside the country away from VA facilities, I can go see a local provider for any of those service-connected conditions, and get reimbursed
- Has filed a reimbursement claim to FMP before (very familiar with the process)
- Using a desktop/laptop device

**First Task - Intro Page**
- Seems like the...very familiar with the VA dot gov pages. It's very well put together. Looks like it's got highlighted information so it's easy to identify with what's the main points
- Identifying the bulleted information is very easy to understand
- What would they do next: I would, knowing that this information here about what I need to prepare before, I'd make sure I have all that information available. I'm always looking for that extra layer of information so I'd click that link here in this supporting documents and make notes of what documents do I need to prepare before I went to fill out the form. And then I would follow the directions to make sure I have direct deposite set up, to make sure I'm ready to get started.
- Recall: it was instructions on how to prepare to file a claim and establish a direct deposit, with an option to get started right then
- Rating: 5, someone who is used to using online resources to research, finding things that were easy to read, made it very easy for me to find those key points of what is needed to get that claim started/filed

**Second Task - Direct Deposit Static Page**
- The page is laid out well, the bolding gets my attention
- Personally I'm drawn to this link to see what else is there for me to find out (about the FSC process)
- Likes the numbered steps process, it's easy to follow. Guides you through
- Recall: Figure out which bank you'll use, find your documentation, fill everything in in FSC to make sure your direct deposit is established before you file a FMP claim
- Rating: 5, very clear, easy to follow. Seems like it's been well thought out

**Pause Page - Comparison Question**
- They seem to be the same, but it's been many years since I set up my VA disability compensation. It's very straightforward.
- I don't see anything different, but I didn't see any content about if I have a foreign bank account that I want to use for my FMP direct deposit.

**Third Task - FMP Form Flow and Upload**
- Likes the progress bar! Wow.
- Likes the content explaining how to direct payment
- Upload page: likes the supporting docs bullet points
- "This is all pretty standard for Veterans" as far as the layout and directions on the upload page
- It's nice that it's familiar to other things on VA dot gov

**Fourth Task - Confirmation Page**
- Review page: it's a feel-good, I like being able to verify that I didn't fat-finger anything or make a mistake in putting something together.
- Pretty easy to navigate
- Comforting to use this form
- In real life, I'd be reviewing everything. I don't want to make a mistake and disrupt the flow of my benefits. I always take that extra chance to review an application, information.
- After I submit it's reviewed, and then it's either paid or returned for additional information/action. If I'm looking at this page, I'm going to print or download this page. I don't think I would actually print it, I'd just screenshot the submission information, as confirmation. And then it tells you what your next steps are, what you need to do. It shows you how to get some help
- Confidence rating: 4, I didn't see any confirmation that my direct deposit had been verified. I'm fairly confident I did everything correctly, but until it's actually in the bank, I'm hesitant to say I'm very confident
- I want something that says "hey yes this is a real banking, true and accurate institution...something that says hey yeah we received your direct deposit information and everything checks out"
- But I would be more than willing to submit my claim online, knowing my direct deposit information follows those steps. 

**Fifth Task - Content Comprehension & Mental Model**
- DD: Seems like a one and done, unless you have any changes to make after you establish it. Seems like every subsequent claim, it would be easy to verify that your direct deposit information hasn't changed
- Any changes? Verification of your information
- Contacting VA: The juice is worth the squeeze. Why not use some sort of technology to be able to set up your direct deposit?
- Nothing would give me pause or not file online while establishing direct deposit
- On the confirmation page, it would be nice to show the banking information, or the bank name. Just something on that page to let you know.

**Post-Task Interview**
- This form is going to be a very helpful way to make things easier for Veterans who live overseas

**Additional Notes**
1. wants more confirmation that the banking information entered is correct or verified, both during the form and on the confirmation page
2. Is very familiar with the FMP claims and is excited to see this come online
3. Mentioned there is no reference for what to do if you don't have a domestic bank account (e.g. foreign banking instructions)
