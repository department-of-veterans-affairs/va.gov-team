Notetaker: Hieu Vo

**Introduction**
- P3 is on mobile (Android)
- Located in the Philippines 


**Warm-up Questions**
- 90% SC rating at the VA
- Receive monthly VA Compensation
- Registration for FMP, but never used
- FMP in P3 word: service that VA does not cover

- Tech trouble, P3 opened the prototype but cannot screen. Jessica screenshared.

**First Task - Intro Page**
- P3 said it looks like it is instructions
- "simple instructions on how to get reimbursement for claim" expect to keep the receipt when going to a foreign doctor.
- Rating 5/5, it is very simple, very direct.
- "Very similar to submitting Claims stateside, it is not that different."

**Second Task - Direct Deposit Static Page**
- You want to determine if you need to set up direct deposit or not, which you would need for this claim.
- "You would need to use ID.me for regular VA login"
- "First, you would determine if you set up your direct deposit"
- P3 is already set up for direct deposit, so it is redundant.
- P3 has done travel reimbursement before. "It is a different portal, but you're doing the same."
- Instruction rating 5/5, pretty simple.
- Helpful because it is 5 different sections.  

**Pause Page - Comparison Question**
- Different paperwork, but still the same thing (compared to his experience with Travel Reimbursement)

**Third Task - FMP Form Flow and Upload**
- Understands the Veteran vs Provider selection very clearly.
- Upload the billing statement; comment that it looks like the system wants receipts too. "Very simple".
- Review screen "You're just checking everything." Confirming your selection.
- Confirm that this information is correct before you get paid.

**Fourth Task - Confirmation Page**
- Once you submit a claim, you want to print it out for your record
- "It has never taken up 90 days, but maybe it is different when you're [outside] of the United States."
- Rating 5/5, very confident.

**Fifth Task - Content Comprehension & Mental Model**
- Clearly explains the FMP claim process (checklist, submission, appeal process)
- "To me, it is very simple, very simple"
- "I do not see anything wrong with it. It is very straightforward," compared to some form.
- Right now, it is very difficult to speak to someone on the phone at the VA.
- "If you can't handle your business online, you're in a very bad place", recently phone as been going straight to "We're unable to take your call right now"

**Post-Task Interview**
- It is impossible to get an approved provider for urgent care; it is not worth filing a Claim. And healthcare it is so cheap in the Philippines that he just pays out of pocket for it.
- The approved provider is not convenient for P3.

**Additional Notes**
- P3 has done Travel Reimbursement before; this is similar, but just uses a different portal.
- P3 understood the content with ease and had no problem with any of the verbiage. "To me, it is very simple, very simple."
- It is not worth filing a Claim. Approved provider is not every accessible in the Philippines but healthcare is cheap so P3 pays everything out of pocket.
