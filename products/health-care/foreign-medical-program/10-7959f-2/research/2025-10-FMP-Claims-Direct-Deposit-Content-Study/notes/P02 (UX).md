**Introduction**
- 100% service-connected through VA
- Receive disability compensation through the VA

**Warm-up Questions**
- FMP in their own words: a program for Veterans stuck overseas to seek medical treatment and get reimbursement
- Desktop user
- Able to do a 'new private window' for Firefox

**First Task - Intro Page**
- Have not dealt with FSC before
- "Is the FSC outside of the VA network?" Imagine it as a portal outside the FMP.
- Have heard there is development moving FMP to direct deposit.
- Rating of clarity: 4/5 because unfamiliar with the process so far. There are two separate subjects. 
- He is in a group that talks about FMP a lot. 

**Second Task - Direct Deposit Static Page**
- This is a process stricting around FMP.
- "Reference to FSC. New term for me"
- Problem with Login: For overseas Vetrerans, the forced implementation of ID.me; is a struggle. They're not in the states often enough to get new licenses/IDs. It is a "death loop" for video confirmation.
- Some folks have to use VPN, ID.me can be a doom loop. 
- Would like a worksheet for working
- Want an option for physical printout and submission (login trouble = means I can't save anything).
- Rating: 3/5, 3 different actions. Vendor file form is new.
- Don't understand who the Vendor is.
- "I won't say it is drinking from a fire hose", but it is a lot to do.

**Pause Page - Comparison Question**
- Lots of us did direct deposit a long time ago elsewhere, and that information is now ported to VA system. But with the common ID.me login issue, I can't check that information.

**Third Task - FMP Form Flow and Upload**
- Veteran vs Provider option is "same old, same old", similar to the paper form.
- Standard stuff for the upload page
- "I have to explain to the older guys on how to reduce their file sizes"
- Review: For mailing address, being able to recognize different postal codes, error without code or explanation.
- Mailing address: Is this for Provider or Veteran?
- Phone number: I hope they got their international code all dialled in.
- Payment selection vs payment option - awkward mismatch. Jessica, note it is a mockup issue.

**Fourth Task - Confirmation Page**
- Rating: If I set up FSC, I'll be confident about that.
- Commented that in the UK, the banking system automatically checks your banking number as your type. So you know at least your information is correct as you go.

**Fifth Task - Content Comprehension & Mental Model**
- Would work things in writing (instead of portal access) so they can take it to the providers or other conversations to get the right paperwork.
- In UK, lots of Veterans has the national health service, so 90% of the medical service is taken care of. So there is no claim for the most part.
- Wants a shortform flow for the FMP if they're already have certain things set up.
- Hate duplicity, wants the system to provide all the information they'll need if they're going to call.

**Post-Task Interview**
- Wants to make sure people can get to these pages BEFORE you log in. 

**Additional Notes**
- A major pain point for the overseas Veterans is the Login system (VPN, outdated ID since they're haven't be in the US, etc).
- Wants all pages/links to be accessible without sign-in.
- Not familiar with the FSC portal, expect some friction in the process due to unfamiliarity.
