**Introduction**
- Yes I am (okay with recording)
- Yes I am (okay with recorded clip)


**Warm-up Questions**

- Service connected disability - rating is 80%
- yes, receives direct deposit

- have not heard of Foreign Medical Program before

- Sounds like a service related to receiving care overseas

- Desktop computer



**First Task - Intro Page**
- I am seeing this is about filing for a claim
- As I mentioned earlier, it is for care outside of the US
- It is for service connected conditions, would need to be service related
- Link for documents 
- If I was doing this I would click that (supporting docs link)
- It looks like it is direct deposit much like payments for service related, payments
- Get started button if I want to do that now, and some links and phone numbers for help

- If I was I would click this first (documents you need link) then go to Get Started 

- It was basically instructions on how to file a claim for any foreign medical services for my service related disabilities, the things I need and more information

- Rating = 5 it seemed pretty straightforward and clear



**Second Task - Direct Deposit Static Page**

- So this looks like how to setup direct deposit, discussed on previous page
- If I have one setup , that can be used and can skip ahead
- This is the information need, this is the sign in link from step 1 and I am assuming that will connect the information
- After that, it looks like, I will select this button (FSC Vendor File Form) and then there are these sections I will have to finish. I guess additional from what is provided from the direct deposit information.

- I think it is mostly clear. What I think is confusing is this — the Customer Engagement Portal is going to be.
Step 4
- Clarification on when or where I will be access that home page (FSC portal)
- I … lets see… I already know I do have direct deposit set up. I would skip to step 3 here, this is the Customer Engagement Portal, the Financial Services Center.
- I would sign in here and complete this form - which is this portal
- If you have the same exact wording that would be helpful, lost track this is talking about the same thing
- Hopefully everything goes through okay when I use my ID.me account
- Go through 5 sections and then click finish

Rating = 4.5 or not half a 4
This tripped me up a little (steps 3-5) Financial services center and Vendor File Form. Or parentheses (FSC) to connect what ties to what. It is a bit confusing.
The other steps are clear. The other information you will need to provide if you are setup.

- Id.me expectations: Same sign in screen. Depending on the interface, everything to automatically load, just a couple page. Or just a few buttons or clarifying information - For someone who already has this setup it should be quick. More personalized already have an account. 




**Pause Page - Comparison Question**
- yes (has direct deposit for disability comp)

- Process would be the same; just the direct deposit into the account I have set up 
- Um versus what I already have set up - NO I wouldn’t expect anything different 


**Third Task - FMP Form Flow and Upload**
-  Looks like I am almost at the end of the process. Asking me who the payments are going to go to.
- Telling me if I have paid, select Veteran. If not, select Provider so the money can go directly to the provider.
- It is asking me to select who to send the money to depending if I have paid for the services provided

Documents Upload: 
- Since I clicked on Veteran, it seems like it is just asking for more documents and proof.
- Receipt or billing statement, what supporting documents I need for certain claims
- I guess if I fall under of these I would click here to see what additional documents I need.
- Would upload from dragging or selecting then continue

- I think this page is also very clear.

REVIEW PAGE: 
- I personally like to check anything I would click expand all. But for the demo, would go through each and assume it is all correct here.
- Look through everything to make sure 

- Issue with accordion data showing incorrect

- Fake info was throwing them, state if it was their own info it would be clear





**Fourth Task - Confirmation Page**
- Would print and download a copy for myself

- Confidence rating = it would be a 5, never had any issues with a VA direct deposit. Would not be expecting anything crazy. 

- No nothing would make me not file claim online. 
- Never had any issues, lot of confidence on my end. 


- Make one request - can I have all the top part blocked out  (browser bookmarks showing) as well if this is shared!




**Fifth Task - Content Comprehension & Mental Model**
- I’m recalling that, what steps we took…
- Overview of what information I would need, I think there was, was forgetting which step, different steps depending on whether I paid or the provider hasn’t been paid.
- A couple of steps if direct deposit wasn’t set up, but mine was, so the process would be pretty simple and straightforward

- Consistency with Customer Support Portal how it was labeled, same abbreviations or labeling  

- calling extra step - It looked like it would be straightforward A couple of options to reach out if I need help. I recall setting up before really easy. No issues basically 

- (not want to file) I think as I had experiences the right amount or right date, I would be hesitant not to (more on after side of things)

- just based off my experience, it has always come in the right date and right amount, would not expect any trouble. IF I have filled out my information correctly 

- And also, if it has been approved. 


**Post-Task Interview**
- I think overall it was pretty straightforward and clear nothing confusing 

- WITH REQUESTED INFO BLOCKED OUT to share clips (bookmarks in browser)
