**Introduction**
- Notes

**Warm-up Questions**
- Service connetct - yes - 100%
- receives direct deposit for payment
- has heard of FMP
- Is registered
- "So if I have, if I'm in another country, away from VA facility, I can go see a local provider for any of those service-connected conditions"
- Has filed before
- Using a laptop


**First Task - Intro Page**
- Very familiar to other pages in va.gov
- well put together, has highlighted info, easy to identify main points, easy to identify main bullets
- What he would do next - knowing that this info about what he needs to know before, he'd check to see if he had that information available
- He checks for the extra layer of info, so would follow the link for the supporting docs and make notes on what he needs to prepare
- would follow directions for direct deposit set up 
- in own words - intro to program, what he needed, how to set up direct deposit
- scale clarity - 5 - someone who is used to using online resources would be able to find the well spaced/bolded key points to identify what is needed
- 

**Second Task - Direct Deposit Static Page**
- laid out well, bold print gets his attention to look at what he needs to do 
- drawn to the link about the fsc site
- pretty easy to identify what's here
- in own words - process for direct deposit - identifying what bank to use, fill out all the documentation, turn it all in, do all that before filing a claim
- instruction rating - 5 - very clear, easy to follow

**Pause Page - Comparison Question**
- feels like it would be very similar 
- didn't see anything immediately that would imply he needs any different/new information for a fmp claim direct deposit 


**Third Task - FMP Form Flow and Upload**
- recognizes the stepper from other forms/online applications, finds it helpful 
- lays out the definitions well (where to send payments)
- saved notification helps feel better that progress is saved if he has to go back
- Supporting page - very clear information, bullet points, easy to id what info is needed, called out link for additional doc info
- all feels standard to any other form for vets who are doing online work 
- did mention a reference number for the saved in progress - not sure if that's the number people are using when they say they have a confirmation number?


**Fourth Task - Confirmation Page**
- recognizes ability to expand informatio
- likes the feel-good way to confirm all is well by reviewing
- statement of truth needed so folks understand it's accurate/true
- would be a comfortable feeling from what he knows about va.gov and other forms
- wouldnt want to make a mistake and interrupt the flow of his benefits, so would take a minute to verify again at the end to make sure he didnt fat finger a mistake
- after submit, assumes it'll be reviewed/process, then paid or returned for additional information or action, the opportunity to print is nice
- he wouldnt print but would screenshot the confirmation page
- nice to see where to get help on here
- confidence rating for direct deposit - there was no confirmation that his direct deposit has been confirmed - so only a 4/5 
- wanted to see a confirmation that it was truly set up accurately before saying it's a 5
- once in the bank first time, more confident
- ideally seeing something that the bank is verified as a true/accurate bank
- feels more than confident that they could get reimbursed using this form


**Fifth Task - Content Comprehension & Mental Model**
- seems like it's a one and done, just like disability
- would stay the same unless you had to change it
- wouldn't need to verify again later
- one thing to change: some sort of verification for correct banking information or that all steps have been completed
- thoughts on extra set up - "juice is worth the squeeze" - why not use technology to do it rather than a phone call or paper method 
- anything about the direct deposit information - nothing of concern
- what would make him more confident after filing but before deposit - on confirmation page, listing where the banking information will be sent would help him feel more confident that it's the right info/bank
- online portal for claims will be really nice, very helpful to make things alot easier
- located in s korea 

**Post-Task Interview**
- Notes

**Additional Notes**
1. Very comfortable with va.gov ecosystem and called out consistency

2. Would follow links to get more detailed information when they are available (links to what you need for supporting docs, how to get to fsc site)

3. Wants more confirmation/verfication around banking information - minimum being that all fields are provided during set up, ideal would be including bank name and that it's been verified to be a real bank
