**Warm-up Questions**
- Notes

**First Task - Intro Page**
	• - Ease of use/understanding: 5

**Second Task - Direct Deposit Static Page**
	• P4 has never used the program before, unfamiliar with FSC Vendor File Form, unsure if signed up for FSC, and not sure what a PIV is
	• P4 has ID.me and "the other one" and used the other for VA systems
	• Ease of use/understanding: 3, "only because I haven't used this before."

**Pause Page - Comparison Question** 
	• P4 usually visits VA.gov to update direct deposit with no need to go off of that site
	• P4 noted that the vendor process is different between FMP claims and usual direct deposit? 

**Third Task - FMP Form Flow and Upload**
	• P4's understanding of the page is that it's designed to inform the VA if they have to pay your back or pay the provider. "You have to let them know 'I paid out of pocket and want to be reimbursed," or if you were billed, VA can pay the bill
	• P4 felt the page was self-explanatory - you want your money back, so you need proof of what you paid for

**Fourth Task - Confirmation Page**
	• P4 flagged two mailing address accordions **prototype quirk, was also mentioned in P2 session**
	• P4 would like to see proof that the deposit went to ACH/direct deposit because "this would be me checking the mailbox and not the banking account"
		○ Noted that many places use account ending numbers or routing numbers, which is helpful
		
**Fifth Task - Content Comprehension & Mental Model**
	• What action would you take on this page?
		○ Screenshot or print the information for records
	• P4 would also like to see a status page to check progress and approval. Would check the page based on need - if urgently, P4 would check more frequently. P4 is aware of the 90-day approval period, so might check every few weeks if there was no immediate need, and would also contact "the number" if they feel it's taking too long
	• Confidence rating that direct deposit is set up correctly based on prototype: 4
		○ P4: I'm still stuck on the PIV and vendor info that I've never dealt with.
	• Anything to improve confidence re: vendor info?
		○ P4: Not sure. Unless there's a glossary or further explanation on what the vendor side is, I'm not sure if it's for a health care provider, health insurance.
	• Anything that would not make you file your claim 
		○ PF: No, there's usually a number you can call and someone will walk you through it.

**Post-Task Interview**
	• -P4 felt that as long as steps are followed and the right docs are submitted, the process should be easy
	• P4 would change the vendor information if possible. When asked if instructions would be helpful, they weren't sure and noted that people who use the form more may have better understanding, or that they could call a representative to explain the process

**Additional Notes**
	• P4: No notes, but "gives me a heads up if I do decide to go to a foreign country and deal with their medical program."

**General themes:**
	• P4 seemed mostly confident about the clarity of the content and how to navigate the pages, even if they were unfamiliar with specific processes
	• P4 seemed less confident about the FSC Vendor File Form, as well as what a VA PIV is
	• P4 seemed mostly confident reaching out by phone to follow up on claims or get further instructions from VA on how to navigate forms
	• P4 felt a status page and confirmation of where payment is going - by routing number, last 4 of account number, etc. - would be helpful
  • P4 felt that a phone call from VA would be faster and more effective than sending an email or mailing a letter if there's an issue with the claim
