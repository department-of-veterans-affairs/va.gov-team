**First Task - Intro Page**
- I read what’s here so far, can’t scroll up but you can do that for me
- Okay

- (first FMP Claim) I would upload an invoice 
- Usually what I have done I have paid, or they sent me an invoice and then upload into VA.gov
- Uh.. I would upload the itemized bill and if I’ve already paid the provider I would fill out the form and upload it so I can be reimbursed

- I did this recently in August, had to go to Emergency Room there
- First they took my information from my disability card, I did pay some for the pharmacy and I uploaded and they reimbursed me


PAUSE

- Um, information was how to upload invoices that’s what I remember
- RATING = I would uh.. 6 or 7 or 1-5, a 4
- Well first of all, I’m not a young Vet. I’m an older Vet know how to negotiate through VA.gov, on at least once a day for something. Because of my age, not as proficient as you are. I’m a Vietnam Vet.

- I think the VA.gov site is pretty easy, if you know what you are doing. I don’t have much problem with the VA.gov, going through the procedures. I’m on there a lot for something.
- I use secure messaging all the time


**Second Task - Direct Deposit Static Page**
- Ok
- I think if you go through the steps one by one, it would be pretty easy to do
- I usually go step by step, don’t always remember
- Number 2, that’s fairly easy…
- I already have an ID.me account - a lot of Vets don’t by the way. I’ve helped a lot Vets setup their ID.me accounts

- I feel that’s fairly, explains a lot fairly easy to me, just a matter of following the steps

- I think it’s fairly easy, follow step by step, like your tax return at the end of year. Just follow step by step.

- I would just follow the steps

- Rating = I would give it a 4. The reason not a 5 is because of my age. Pretty staightforward.

- Only been there once or twice, at the local VA, they have an office there they will help you if you have any questions about navigating through VA.gov. I’ve only been there once, don’t remember the reason why.
- Just a matter about doing it once, following the steps.

- What is helpful, number 3 learn how to create an ID.me account. I talk to a lot of Vets and they don’t have an ID.me account. Message back and forth to my clinics all the time, it is great.
- Better than it was a couple of years ago, probably with what you people are doing.



**Pause Page - Comparison Question**
- I think it is fairly uniform, I think so
- I think that you use about the same method, so it’s not confusing to Vets
- Over a period of time over the past few years been easier and easier
- I’m on VA.gov at least every day
- If it is to claim reimbursement for milage
- I make sure I am reimbursed for my milage, same as with my medications
- Same as reimbursement for any foreign travel
- I think it’s fairly uniform 
- My wife is on the VA, reimbursement for spouses, we take care of that all the time.


**Third Task - FMP Form Flow and Upload**
- I think that is fairly easy
- In fact if I paid a claim, a pharmacy, just upload to get reimbursement
- Or if I haven’t they would just pay for that
- It’s asking me if I have already paid the provider to upload my invoice so I can be reimbursed, or if I haven’t paid I would upload what I need to for them to pay the provider
- It’s an either or situation
- Nothing unclear
- Upload the billing statement - you have to learn how to upload
- I use my scanner into my Mac and upload into my documents and that’s how I upload into VA.gov
- Yep, that’s fairly easy 
- I’m pretty familiar with this (upload page) but I know a lot of Vets that can’t do this (upload files) 
- They also didn’t go through the process, a lot of Vets who should be rated for the disability but aren’t they don’t want to go through the application

Review page
- Yep, that’s all fairly the process you know
(Very familiar) this 4 or 5, might take me a bit longer because of my age, but fairly easy to do it this way
- That is pretty clear

**Fourth Task - Confirmation Page**
- It just verifies that I have submitted the proper documents, yeah
- What’s confusing to some Veterans, have a Veteran friend, he has a hard time navigating through VA.gov. Just a matter of doing it a couple of times. But again, just need to go to the office at the VA center and they will help you. 
- I think that this process, compared to maybe 5 years ago, it has been developed.
- I have done (research study) for at least 5 years, things seem to be a lot easier which is why I am doing this survey for sure
- The process is successful as far as I’m concerned 


**Fifth Task - Content Comprehension & Mental Model**
- Well, I also know VA time is not normal time
- You can submit something and wait for a claim, you can expect 30 days but it could take 90 VA time
- I have submitted claims that have been denied, and I just request a review. Usually if they review it they accept it.
- If you get turned down for a rating or something, can request a high level review. Done that a couple of times and every time they approved.
- Went to an emergency room in August on an island, first the denied but then after I talked to somebody further about it and they approved it.
- You just need to know what to do

RATING = Well with this protocol and this here, say a 5
- If you put in the proper information, they sent out a reimbursement it will arrive
- Give it a 4 or 5

- No, no reason to not file online
- If you go to the claims office take a while to talk to somebody, this make things a lot quicker
- A lot of Vets don’t use VA.gov because they don’t know it is available. 


**Post-Task Interview**
- I feel it’s fairly simple, if you follow the steps one by one, you’re going to get your claim
- Absolutely 

- (item to change) well… I just know how to do it, if something comes up know where to go to get help
- Call the VA 1000 number, they can get on the VA.gov site with me, I don’t find it that difficult 

- Quite a nice process

- (step to call) you’re just making it easier, simpler faster

- No, I would definitely file online
- You can go get help at the VA but waste a lot of time, to drive there, sit in a room, if there is an assistant to help you out, what their mood is
- A lot easier on line
- I have no doubt, I don’t question that (received direct deposit)

- Fairly easy how you set it up here
