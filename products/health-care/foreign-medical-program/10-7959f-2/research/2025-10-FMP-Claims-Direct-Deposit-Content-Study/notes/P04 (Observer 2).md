## P4

Notetaker: [Jessica]


**Introduction**
- Yes confirm recording
- Yes confirm clip recording to share is okay


**Warm-up Questions**
- SC, yes
- rating = TD 100%; reg 90%
- direct deposit - I do 
- heard of FMP - no
- A couple people mention it out of country, see it on reddit a lot 

- Own words:
- Just like our program, just if you’re out of the country



**First Task - Intro Page**

- (scrolls through page)
- works differently, you have to get billed first
- differently from current benefits - I don’t get billed, they just bill the VA
- That is the only thing I saw different

Filing first claim: 
- I would assume Get started and have all my documents need
- They said supporting documents assuming, billing paperwork. Proof that I paid for the services so I can get reimbursed for it 
- look until I have that information

Clarity Rating of Intro Page = 5
Self explanatory

They basically explain what you have to do


**Second Task - Direct Deposit Static Page**

I don’t think I have ever used the Financial Services Center site before, I guess that is just for this program

I’m not sure with the PIV is (under sign in instructions)

I’m not sure if that’s the one I use to sign in (ID.me) since the update, there were two options ID.me and the other one, I think I used the other one

This Vendor file form, because I didn’t have to deal with it, I know nothing about it.

I guess again it is self-explanatory, especially if you already went through the process to sign up for FSC. I don’t recall signing up for that, when eBenefits switch, all my information transferred over. 
Had benefits since 2011

PROCESS
- I would have to go on this Financial Services Center site, make sure I have all the information, Tax ID.
I would have to use ID.me or that VA PIV
Then I have to do a Vendor File Form - not familiar with that, would have to read up on that
After that, submit the information


Rating: instructions; terminology on here about a 3
Not really, I just don’t know what that VA PIV Is



**Pause Page - Comparison Question**
Disability comp vs FMP
- I think they would be different 
- I’ve never had to go to that site, I just go to VA.gov and update my direct deposit 
- On the site, I don’t have to go offsite

- That Vendor process, I’ve never had to do that either 



**Third Task - FMP Form Flow and Upload**

(Reads out loud page instructions)
- Basically, it is informing the VA if they have to pay you back or pay the provider
- Hey, I paid out of pocket to get reimbursed. Or I got a bill and they need to pay provider

(Upload docs page reads out loud)
- not really (more explanation needed)
- It seems self explanatory, you would want your money back so you would have proof of everything you paid for


**Fourth Task - Confirmation Page**

Review Page
- Calls out prototype misalignment
- Calls out Payment Selection and that it mentions Veteran mailing address

- Expects to see the account with dot dot dot covering some for privacy 
- That way if it is wrong I can know and fix the issue

Confirmation Page: 

- First thing I would print or save 

- Status page to check on and see where it was

- Frequently check - depends on need. I would frequently check like people do in tax time if I was in need.
Maybe once every 3 weeks, saying it takes 90 days.

- I guess if I feel it is taking too long, I can contact the number they have on here
- If I did something incorrect, I can see what I messed up
- After you submit, realize wrong address or type in zip code or something like that

Confidence Rating = 4
Because I’m still stuck on the PIV and that vendor information I’ve never had to deal with

Glossary on what the Vendor thing is. Not sure if they are talking about a healthcare provide
Not sure what a Vendor is

- Not file online; no not really. There is usually a number you can call if you have an issue somebody will walk you through it. 



**Fifth Task - Content Comprehension & Mental Model**
- Basically as you follow steps and submit documents and have all your proof, it should be an easy process

- Just about that Vendor information - stuck on that part

- Maybe just me with not having to deal with the FMP program
- The Vendor step 
- A rep they work with to explain the process to them

- call; I think it is convenient. They could call and have it set up that way.

- no (no reason to no file online)

- A claim status page that it was approved

- either, they have a habit of sending an email or mail you a letter in the mail. If they come across an issue they should be able to call, that way it can be fixed faster. 

- Expects a phone call from the VA about the issue



**Post-Task Interview**
- No - it gives me a heads up if I do decide to go to a foreign country and have to deal with the medical program.
