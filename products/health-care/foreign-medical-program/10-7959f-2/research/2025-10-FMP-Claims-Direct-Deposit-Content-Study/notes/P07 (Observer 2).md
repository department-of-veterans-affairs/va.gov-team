**Introduction**
- Yes (confirm recording permission)
- Yes (video clips)


**Warm-up Questions**
- I do (service connected disability)
- 100%
- Yes (direct deposit)
- Heard of FMP before

- Registered , I am

- “ If I’m outside the country away from the VA facility go to a local provider about service connected conditions and then get care for that condition and get reimbursed”

- Very familiar with FMP 


**First Task - Intro Page**
- Seems like the , very familiar to the VA.gov other pages, very well put together
- Highlighted information easy to identify what the main points are
- The bullets is very easy to understand

- I think I would, knowing that this information here in the middle what I need to prepare before I fill out the form
- Make sure I have that information available
- Looking for that extra layer of information, a link here to see extra information (supporting docs link) 
- Make a note of what documents I need to prepare 
- Follow instructions to make sure I had a direct deposit setup to make sure I am ready

Own words on pause screen 
- introduction to the program, instruction and what I need to prepare and how establish a direct deposit and an option to get started
- Rating = 5
- Someone who is used to using online resources to research, finding things that will well spaced, bold print bullet points made it very easy for me to find those key points of what is needed to get that information 


**Second Task - Direct Deposit Static Page**
- I think it is laid out well, bold print to get attention of what I need to do
- Personally I am drawn to this link to see what else there is there for me to find out 
(Does not mention FSC mentions at first pass through the page)
- Clearly tells you want you need to roll through
- Pretty easy 

- I think you are identifying what bank you are going to use and fill out the documentation and turn it all in and make sure your direct deposit is established before filing a claim 

- Rating = again go with that 5, very clear very easy to follow, well thought out
- What are the steps in between to get to that finish line

- No (nothing confusing) as mentioned before, the bold print and the numeric way it is established, very helpful
- I don’t see anything without digging into it that is standing out as confusing


**Pause Page - Comparison Question**
- I think it would be the same, it has been many many years since I setup my direct deposit for disability compensation
- From memory is very similar, bank information to provide
- I didn’t see anything immediately, but if there was a foreign bank account I was using there might be something there


**Third Task - FMP Form Flow and Upload**
- So I recognize the , the graph here the status bar, in my opinion that has been helpful for other type of online applications
- Helps people know how they are progressing through
- Easy to identify the radio button to fill in where the payments would go to

- mentions feel good piece of save in progress alert and id number

- That is very well laid out

SUPPORTING DOCS
- Some very clear information here, bullet points
- Easy to identify what information putting here
- Documents that you need and resources to find more information, hyperlink
- This is pretty standard for Veterans these days who have done any online work
- Walk though the steps to upload or drag and drop

Notices finish the application later link as a benefit if you get interrupted 

- From my own experience working with online applications here, very helpful to have that something to look familiar. Not alarming, very similar to other things on VA.gov

REVIEW PAGE
- Again, I recognize the ability to expand your information a chance to verify that everything is correct
- Feel good way to verify you didn’t fat finger anything or put a mistake putting things together
- Very familiar 
- Talks though statement of truth, sign
- Pretty easy to navigate and a comfortable feeling the first time just what I know about VA.gov and research 

Absolutely review everything before submitting.
Don’t want to make a mistake and interrupt the flow of my benefits or something
Always take that extra chance to review
Open all of these to verify everything is still correct, then move forward before submitting 


**Fourth Task - Confirmation Page**
- After I submit my claim it is going to be reviewed, make sure all the documents re correct and then paid or returned for additional action
- Looking at this page, the opportunity to print this page. Not actually print but screen shot that I submitted it. I have this as some kind of confirmation.
- Tells you next step and what you need to do, and what to do if it doesn’t work well
- I think it is good to get you back to the VA website


Confidence Rating = 
- Without having some sort of confirmation that my direct deposit had been verified of some sort.
- Can submit my claim, and turn in everything so probably a 4
- Fairly confident did everything correctly, didn’t see a page, until it was actually in the bank would be hesitant to say a 5 confident level 
- Maybe just something that says this is a real banking institution, don’t know if that is possible to verify that Bank 123 in USA is an institution. But something that to say received direct deposit notification and everything checks out.
- Everything I see here, feel confident to submit my claim. Feeling confident I could verify that before I hit submit. 


**Fifth Task - Content Comprehension & Mental Model**
- Seems like it is a one and done, like VA compensation, once you establish it, it stays the same.
- After verify your direct deposit hasn’t changed, then move on with your claim. 
- Short some sort of verification, you’ve put in all the requested check in
- You routing number is put in and your bank number put it, and maybe miss a step necessary to setup direct deposit


- I think the juice is worth the squeeze if you will
- Why not use some sort of technology to do that instead of filling out a form or phone call, leverage some sort of online self service portal to do that, well worth the effort. 
- Me personally, no Don’t see anything in there that would have be pause or be cautioned about establishing a direct deposit.
- Maybe I overlooked it, on that confirmation page, we are going to be sending the deposit to institution. Maybe not the account or routing number, but just that we got your claim and we will be putting in this institution. 


- An online portal for claims submission, has been a desire for those of us who live overseas make it much easier 

In South Korea 


**Post-Task Interview**
- No questions 



#### Top 3 takeaways: 
1.  Overall stated the content and information was clear and the form was consistent with other VA.gov experiences they had 
2.  Not sure if he thought the bank account information would be entered in the form vs another site...he did state that it would be nice on the confirmation page to at least state the financial institution where the reimbursement would be sent
3.  He stated an "online portal for claims submission has been a desire for those of us overseas"
