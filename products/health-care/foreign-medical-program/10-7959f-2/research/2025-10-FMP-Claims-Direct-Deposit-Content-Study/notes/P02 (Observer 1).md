**Introduction**
- Notes

**Warm-up Questions**
- P2 has 100 percent disability and is signed up for VA direct deposit
- P2 described the FMP program to be designed for "those us of stuck overseas" for service connected positions to receive reimbursements, and to get care through a major medical facility

**First Task - Intro Page**
- P2 was unfamiliar with FSC. "May be independent of disability pay?"
- P2 explained the steps to file their first claim would be to re-read the information on how to gather information and receipts for payment and then get started. They felt that the instructions could be clearer for supporting documents
- P2 rated the intro page clarity a 4 on the 1-5 scale 

**Second Task - Direct Deposit Static Page**
- P2 felt the information they'd seen up to this point focused on two different subjects - the FSC, and how to prepare a claim. "We're conditioned to go to the VA portal account. Whatever the default direct deposit information is needed is there. Now there's a new option to set this up?"
- P2 felt the "forced" implementation of ID.me has been difficult for Veterans outside the United States. "Lots of guys who haven't been in the states for a while don't have licenses or state IDs, so these are hard to do." P2 also explained that certain VA pages redirect to the ID.me page and do not allow Back button functionality, which eliminates all the information that's been entered up to that point. That often means Veterans have to use a paper form to complete their registration.
- P2 rated the instructions a 3 between so many different actions such as direct deposit, signing up, going to the FSC, and completing the vendor file form. "It's like drinking from a fire hose."

**Pause Page - Comparison Question**
- P2 was unclear about the vendor file form and who the vendor is

**Third Task - FMP Form Flow and Upload**
- Notes

**Fourth Task - Confirmation Page**
- Notes

**Fifth Task - Content Comprehension & Mental Model**
- P2 did not express a problem with reaching out by phone for assistance, but noted it would help to have easy access to a list of required documents so there's no need to go searching for them while on the call

**Post-Task Interview**
- P2 suggested it would be helpful to be able to access information without having to log in first to make it easier to see what's required before starting any applications

**Additional Notes**
- Themes
-   P2 felt the ID.me implementation made it difficult to access many VA.gov websites because Veterans living outside the US might not immediately have access to required documents
-   P2 suggested some kind of callout to indicate whether information entered during was captured without losing it would be helpful. They said ID.me usually will not let you use the back button without clearing out any details that's been entered, meaning many Veterans end up using a paper form.
-   P2 noted there was a lot of information given on all the pages and felt there could be some streamlining of the content
