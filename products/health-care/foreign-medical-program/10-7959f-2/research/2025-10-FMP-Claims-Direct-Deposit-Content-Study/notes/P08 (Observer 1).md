**Introduction**
- Yes (recording)
- Yes (clip)



**Warm-up Questions**
- Yes
- 100%
- total and permanent
- I do (direct deposit)
- Yes, I’m signed up for it (holds up paper)

- Minimally, basically if I travel overseas and if I need medical attention, I can go to a facility and see me
- When I was talking to a rep a few years ago a rep suggested I sign up for it
- It was a VA employee, I had called asking about Veteran’s benefits, can’t remember specifically, he recommended this as a tangental issue
- No issue, very easy, one sheet
- Correct, haven’t used it yet

- Desktop 




**First Task - Intro Page**
- share my screen… I have this on a separate screen, so … you want me to share this?
- (working through screen share setup with multiple screens and issues) 
- (pivot to moderator screen share due to sharing difficulties) 


- Alright you can scroll up, I have direct deposit so that’s fine

- Find out which supporting documents you need
- That’s where you need to go right?
- Get the supporting documents

- I don’t think so…can you scroll up again, right there Get Started, I didn’t see that

- Um… no you can go back!
- Stood out? No, because I thought the instructions were pretty clear
- Didn’t have any issues 

- Rating = very easy, 5 that’s easy?
- The only change I would make is the Get Started button larger, or put it closer to the forms that you need
- Then it is not 

- Put Get Started in the top, up 

- I want to get started first, I don’t know if I need any supporting documents yet?
- I want to submit a claim, but it doesn’t differentiate the different types of claims, just want to do a standard claim and get started

- Put it right after the second bullet point (get started)
- I think that certain type of claim, that might be one in a100 
- most people are pretty standard and they want to get started 


**Second Task - Direct Deposit Static Page**
- All right, I figured out, I field the application I don’t know if I linked a direct deposit account to it
- FSC portal
- Alright is there anything different direct deposit account for this than receiving VA benefits?
- Well.. not that you have sent me to a direct deposit page, I am confused
- IF I am already getting VA benefits, and having it direct deposited, why wouldn’t I use that account?
- If you are using VA benefits and have a direct deposit account, click here

- (Wants a callout if you are already receiving, next steps)

- Direct deposit standard stuff

- What is the Financial Services Center?
- Is it the VA Financial Services Center?
- Yes! Want more information here
- Where it says number, 3 sign into the VA Financial Services Center as opposed to the Chase bank financial services center
- If you have the financial services center is then FSC, then identify with what FSC is?
- These Vets, used to right orders. You have to right these things for the enlisted man, needs to be a little clearer

- Wants to know who’s financial service center this is

- (drawing up what step 3 should be)
- Sign into the VA Financial Services Center (FSC)

- Then in step 4 it says VA FSC, don’t know unless it is identified up top

- In number 3, if you don’t have a VA PIV, I don’t know what a PIV is
- You are writing this thing for privates, I am wondering myself… 
- What’s a PIV?

- can you scroll down? Up so I can see the top…
- I understand that, 
- If you have used the FSC portal, get acronyms right
- Direct deposit.. foreign medical program
- Again, if you are going to use these abbreviations but them in parenthesis there, I see in the first but not the second
- Nitpicking this form but trying to understand this for

- ON the previous page needs to be clear, if you have direct deposit or not.

- Yeah, it makes sense, Number 1 is a yes or no, if a no go to number 2. Yes go to number 3
- Yeah I understand it is clear

- So 4, complete the VA Vendor File Form? Is that your bank? The Vendor File form. They don’t ‘think banks are vendors, they think banks are banks. 
- I’m assuming it is going to be asking name of bank, routing numbers
- If it is a bank they are talking about, call it a bank

Rating = 3

- My comments, especially number 1. Yes (making it clear)
- If you have a direct deposit account, do this. If not, do this.



**Pause Page - Comparison Question**
- You are asking me to.. I think it is different. I can’t remember if I had to do online VA forms back then (when set up benefits)
- I think I still had to do paper and pen copies
- Digital process is better



**Third Task - FMP Form Flow and Upload**
- Yeah, I get that first part
- Basically it is a foreign provider though right?
- They have all kinds of crazy address to send checks to right?
- Yeah they do
- No, it’s pretty clear

(Upload screen) 
- Are they still doing COVID 9 vaccines overseas?
- No one is doing them here

- If you want to pay the provider, be reimbursed.
- Don’t recall seeing reimbursed used, just pay 
- to be reimbursed would want to check veteran
- It’s clear
- Nope (additional explanation needed) 

(Review page) 

- Yeah, identification information 
- Okay, you can close that

- Contact information, okay

- Payment selection, alright yeah that’s good
- NO I like this functionality, I have seen it is some of the other VA stuff


**Fourth Task - Confirmation Page**
- Well I would print this page, hopefully the print function worked properly
- Scroll down
- (quietly reads through page for a minute)
- Scroll down a little bit more, alright I understand it

- Sometimes not (reporting print button doesn’t always work)
- I use an Apple, I think they recommend a Google or Microsoft browser or something
- I can’t remember, I think generally many of the pages are working now, just not Safari.
- Yes had to use Chome to print out, does not print out on Safari browser

- Yeah, as long as I input the direct deposit information in properly 


Rating = how do you check that? I would say 5
I have no problem setting up direct deposit accounts

- No reason, to not file online. Why wouldn’t you?
- There is a tracking process right? If you do a paper copy there is no tracking process?

- Would expect to be able to track after 
- ON the FMP website or claim portal, just like on the VA.gov site for other claims. 



**Fifth Task - Content Comprehension & Mental Model**

- Still not sure, if it would automatically recognize my current direct deposit situation or if I would need to go in and set up a whole new 

- Now that I think about it, one of the instructions you can put on there, If you already have a direct deposit account for VA disability claims, you still need to setup a direct deposit for FMP claims. It is a different program
- Your program needs to know your direct deposit information.
- FMP Requires it’s own direct deposit information
- I know I would have to go in and setup in the FMP program
- Don’t remember if they did direct deposit setup when they signed up for the program

- Why would I be contacting the VA by phone, If I don’t have to would rather fill it out on the computer.

- It always gets there, once they have the electrons and proper accounts number. Electronic ACH transfers work. NO problems with ACH transfers.

5, 6, 7 — very confident 

- Just the additional specificity mentioned in comments

- Page layout and 
- You are all accustomed to the acronyms, we are not on the outside! Looking at it for the first time, a complete or accurate description sometimes have trouble
- Back to vendor, is that a bank 



**Post-Task Interview**
- Sure (share video clip)
- Asked if wife was covered and recalled that it was just for the Veteran but asked
-
