## P8 
Notetaker: Tamika

**Introduction**
- Notes

**Warm-up Questions**
- P8 had some familiarity with FMP and is signed up after hearing about it from a VA employee
- Understood that they can travel overseas and get medical attention as a hospital, then get reimbursed by VA
- P8 has not personally used the benefit yet

**First Task - Intro Page**
- P8 noted the first step was to find out what supporting docs were needed by clicking the link, then uploading the docs
- P8 felt the clarity of information was very easy (5).
- P8 suggested making the Get Started button larger, or putting it closer to the supporting documents secion - perhaps after the 2nd bullet. "If it's not a standard claim, I probably won't need all those documents anyway."

**Second Task - Direct Deposit Static Page**
- P8 referenced the paper document they filled out to apply for direct deposit and noted they were "not sure" if it was linked online
- P8 noted that the difference between direct deposit that they completed for VA and FMP was confusing. "If I'm already getting VA benefits and getting direct deposit, why don't I just use that account?"
- P8 suggested a callout that recognizes when a Veteran already has direct deposit, then redirects them to next steps. "If you receive VA benefits and have an established direct deposit account, click here. If you don't have direct deposit, go to Step 2."
- P8 syggested fuller descriptions for acronyms, such as FSC. "These are vets, not colonels. I used to write orders. You gotta write it for the enlisted man. They'll ask all these questions."
- P8 suggested adding a revision to Step 3 to let Veterans know they're on a VA institution or portal. "Sign into the VA Financial Services Center (FSC)."
- P8 was unsure of what a PIV is, as well as what the Vendor File Form is. "Is that the bank? Most people don't think banks are vendors."
- P8 rated the instructions a 3.

**Pause Page - Comparison Question**
- P8 felt the process is different from the paper document they filled out when they first signed up. "You could do some things online, but mostly paper copies. It's different as a digital process."

**Third Task - FMP Form Flow and Upload**
- Notes

**Fourth Task - Confirmation Page**
- P8 appreciated the accordion functionality and overall page design

- **Fifth Task - Content Comprehension & Mental Model**
- P8 noted that print functionality has not always worked on VA pages and hoped the print function would allow them to print a confirmation page at this stage.
- P8 felt confident that as long as they entered in their information correctly, they would rate this step a 5
- P8 suggested adding a way to track a claim on the FMP website or claim portal.

**Post-Task Interview**
- Notes

**Additional Notes**
- Overall themes:
-   P8 wanted content to be clearer, particularly step-by-step language and acronym, and explanation of vendor form
-   P8 was unclear around whether existing direct deposit information can be used for the FMP program
-   P8 liked the page layout, particularly the accordion structure on the confirmation page
