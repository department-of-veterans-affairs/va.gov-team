## Session Summary 
Main takeaway from the research sessions

**P01**
- Canceled

**P02**
- A major pain point for the overseas Veterans is the Login system (VPN, outdated ID since they're haven't be in the US, etc).
- Wants all pages/links to be accessible without sign-in.
- Not familiar with the FSC portal, expect some friction in the process due to unfamiliarity.

**P03**
- P3 has done Travel Reimbursement before; this is similar, but just uses a different portal.
- P3 understood the content with ease and had no problem with any of the verbiage. "To me, it is very simple, very simple."
- It is not worth filing a Claim. Approved provider is not every accessible in the Philippines but healthcare is cheap so P3 pays everything out of pocket.
- Participant was very confident in the direct deposit process and did not have any issues with the content, but also did not really pause on the instructions for the portals (did not call out needing a U.S. bank account, for example)
- P3 said they'd done travel pay claims in the U.S. and was familiar with general process of setting it up
- P3 noticed the 90 day processing period for FMP claims, said that was longer than with claims they'd filed in the U.S.

**P04**
- P5 thought the FMPflow was 'self-explanatory' and expects to get paid if the user follows the steps and submits the correct documents.
- P5 expressed multiple times how unfamiliar they are with the FSC/ Vendor Information and how it is different from the process they're used to.
- P5 expects a Status Page indicating where they are in the process, and the Status Page would give them confidence when they'll get paid.
- Was really unsure about any mentions of the vendor form and would need to look into that more before proceeding. Also unsure of the VA PIV sign in option mentioned as well
- Overall the content and information was clear, just new to process and have never heard of FSC, vendor file form or PIV
- Mentions a claims portal to check status during that 90 days and that the VA would reach out and call them if there were any issues
- P4 seemed mostly confident reaching out by phone to follow up on claims or get further instructions from VA on how to navigate forms if necessary
- P4 felt a status page and confirmation of where payment is going - by routing number, last 4 of account number, etc. - would be helpful
- P4 felt that a phone call from VA would be faster and more effective than sending an email or mailing a letter if any issues arise with claims

**P05**
- Has never had any complaints with the VA direct deposit process, very confident it will work well provided they have submitted their information correctly
- Wants more consistency in the way the content talks about the FSC, but the steps are clear otherwise
- Paused on the review page to understand how the payment options are explained, perhaps needs a little more context there.
- Found all the mentions on the static page around Customer Engagement Portal, FSC and Vendor File form to be confusing. Wanted more consistency in labels
- Didn't think they would have much to do for setup since they receive direct deposit for disability comp today, would skip ahead in that process
- Stated would click links about what documents would be needed
