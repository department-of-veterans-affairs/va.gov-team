**Introduction**
- Participant is on mobile
- Consents to recording
- Consents to use of a recorded clip (consents again at the end of the session)

**Warm-up Questions**
- Has a SCD rating (90%)
- Uses direct deposit for disability payments
- Enrolled in FMP but has not used it
- Connection to community-based resources that are not available at the regional VAMC

**First Task - Intro Page**
- Basically just gives you information on how to file FMP claims
- Upload itemized billing statement, receipt
- Calls out direct deposit and FSC information
- In their own words: Simple directions for how to get reimbursed for claims
- Rates it a 5, says it's very similar to filing claims in the U.S.

**Second Task - Direct Deposit Static Page**
- Looks like directions for setting up direct deposit payment
- Uses ID.me, "just like regular VA app login"
- First you would determine if you're set up for direct deposit (doesn't notice US bank account), says there's a checklist to check that out. There's a list of items you need for direct deposit.
- For me, I already have direct deposit established, so these instructions are redundant.
- Notes he filed travel pay claims in the U.S. and it's the same, just a different portal
- Instructions rating: 5 "it's pretty simple" - like that's it's broken out into 5 steps

**Pause Page - Comparison Question**
- Expect anything different between the travel pay and FMP processes? No, same process but different portal. It's telling you exactly where you're going to submit the claim/information

**Third Task - FMP Form Flow and Upload**
- Payment selection page: I'm assuming I could have the payment sent to my "PE" or anyone else I want
- Upload supporting documents page: Looks like they're asking for the billing statement, and receipts too
- They're very specific as far as types of files you can upload. It makes it very simple. "Self explanatory."

**Fourth Task - Confirmation Page**
- Review page: I'm guessing this is just confirming selections. These things have to be "just right" in order to get paid, get reimbursed.
- Confirmation page: likes the print PDF, notices the 90 day processing time: "I've never known a claim in the U.S. to take that long, but maybe it's different overseas."
- I don't expect to take any action based on this confirmation page. They say it'll take 90 days, but I've never known it to take that long (but has never filed a claim to FMP before)
- Confidence rating: 5
- There's nothing about the information in the screen that would make them not confident to file their FMP claim online

**Fifth Task - Content Comprehension & Mental Model**
- How does FMP claims direct deposit work: basically you're going to submit the claim, there's a checklist of all the information that's required when you submit it. Once you've submitted all the information you can print receipt of submission, and at that point the clock begins and the VA has 90 days to decide. You can appeal the decision (is summarizing the confirmation page, not summarizing the direct deposit process)

**Post-Task Interview**
- Wouldn't change the form or process at all "compared to other forms, this was very simple"
- Right now it's very difficult to get ahold of anyone at VA. They used to be put on hold, sometimes for several hours. Right now you go straight to voicemail. If you can't handle your business online, you're kind of in a bad place.
- The doctors on the FMP-approved list aren't convenient to P3. It's almost impossible to get urgent care, and medical providers are hard to get appointments. It's just not worth filing a claim, because the medical services are so much cheaper abroad compared to the U.S. costs. I just absorbed the cost myself, that's why I haven't really filed a claim here. The medical providers on the list of approved FMP providers is not accessible.

**Additional Notes**
- Participant was very confident in the direct deposit process and did not have any issues with the content, but also did not really pause on the instructions for the portals (did not call out needing a U.S. bank account, for example)
- P3 said they'd done travel pay claims in the U.S. and was familiar with general process of setting it up
- P3 noticed the 90 day processing period for FMP claims, said that was longer than with claims they'd filed in the U.S.
