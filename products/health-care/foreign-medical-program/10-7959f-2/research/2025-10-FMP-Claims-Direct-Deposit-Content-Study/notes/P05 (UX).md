**Introduction**
- Consents to recording and video clips (asks that the top part of the browser not be shared in any video clips)

**Warm-up Questions**
- Has SCD rating (80%)
- Uses direct deposit for monthly disability payment
- Has not heard of FMP before
- In their own words: sounds like a service related to receiving care overseas
- Has never filed a reimbursement claim before
- On desktop computer

**First Task - Intro Page**
- I see this is for filing for a claim
- I see it's for medical care overseas. It has to be service-related care for this
- I see I need at least a billing statement and if I paid, a receipt
- If I was doing this for real, I'd click the link to check if the claim I'm filing for requires a certain type of document
- It looks like it's direct deposit, much like current service-related disability payments
- What would I do next: I'd click that link to make sure I have all the documents that I need, to confirm before I get started
- In your own words: Instructions on how to file a claim for the FMP and any foreign medical service, the things that I need, a link for more information, and a link to get started (skips over the alert for direct deposit)
- Rating: 5, it seemed pretty straightforward and clear

**Second Task - Direct Deposit Static Page**
- It looks like how to set up direct deposit as mentioned on the previous page. If I already have direct deposit I can skip this, but here's the information that I need
- This is the sign-in link, that I'm understanding from Step 1 and I can sign in here and connect that (direct deposit) information
- After that it looks like...(pauses to read). Alright so I'll select this button on the homepage that I go to and I'll have to complete these section. I guess, additional information on top of what's provided from the direct deposit information? And I guess after I'll have the chance to review the information before I finish (setting up the direct deposit process).
- I guess what's confusing is (step 4)...I don't fully understand what the customer engagement portal is supposed to be.
- I'd like clarification on when or where I'll be access that FSC homepage in Step 4.
- I know I have direct deposit set up, so I'd skip to Step 3 and sign in and complete the (VA FSC Vendor File Form)...
- If you had the same exact wording in steps 3 and 4 that would be less confusing
- Hopefully all of my information goes in OK if I use the ID.me account (assumes that it would prefill?)
- Rating: 4, this tripped me up a little. I think it would be helpful if "Financial Services Center" was repeated or put the acronym in parentheses because each step the content is a little different. The steps are clear otherwise, especially Step 1 and what information you'll need to provide in Step 4.
- Based on previously processes, expecting ID.me would use the normal screen, and depending on the interface, it would automatically load (my information), or maybe there's a few buttons to submit clarifying information. Expects it to prefill. 

**Pause Page - Comparison Question**
- Thinks the process for disability DD and FMP DD would be the same
- I would not expect anything different

**Third Task - FMP Form Flow and Upload**
- It's telling me how to select this depending on if I've already paid the provider or not.
- I think this is pretty clear
- Since I clicked on the Veteran because I already paid the provider, it's asking for more documents and proof (that I paid).
- This is telling me what supporting documents I'll need for certain claims. I'd click here (on the click) to find out more.
- This page is very clear

**Fourth Task - Confirmation Page**
- I personally like to review everything, so I'd click "expand all"
- Is mailing address meant to be under "identification information"? It's repeated 3x.
- It looks like there is the option to go back on the Review page to select a different payment option. I think based on the interface I had so far, the only options were payment to me or the provider. So I'm gonna assume if I click "edit" it's because I realized I'm not supposed to pay it to me or something. I see the supporting and I'd check that I'm good to go. Once I've double checked everything I would sign here and click submit.
- Everything has been straightforward and as expected: the only thing would be...it would be helpful under Payment options (pauses on Veteran). Oh I guess that means it'll come to be via direct deposit.
- It looks like it'll take 90 days to process and I'll be contact if they need anything else
- If I selected Veteran it'll be direct deposited.
- Me personally, I'd download and print a copy (both options) for my records
- Confidence rating: 5, I've never had any issues with a VA direct deposit. Not expecting anything crazy.
- Nothing would make them not want to file online. Never had any issues, I have a lot of faith and confidence on my end.

**Fifth Task - Content Comprehension & Mental Model**
- Recall: First it was just an overview of what information that I would need (to file a claim), I think there was...at some point I need to figure out the steps to complete if I paid or if the provider hasn't been paid yet. There were different steps as well for whether or not direct deposit was already set up. I already have it set up, so I assume if I needed to file a foreign medical claim that it would be pretty straightforward

**Post-Task Interview**
- Any changes: a little more consistency in how the FSC Customer Support Portal was labeled across all content. Use the same abbreviations across the steps and sections.
- Contacting the VA call center: I recall there were a couple of options to reach out if I need help. I remember when I initially set up direct deposit for my disability compensation claims that it would be pretty straightforward, no issues.
- I think if I had experiences where the amount didn't get deposited or the right date, that would bother me.
- Based off of your experiences so far: I would not expect any trouble from the VA if I had filled out all my information correctly and the claim has been approved.
- No additional feedback, everything was clear

**Additional Notes**
1. Has never had any complaints with the VA direct deposit process, very confident it will work well provided they have submitted their information correctly
2. Wants more consistency in the way the content talks about the FSC, but the steps are clear
3. Paused on the review page to understand how the payment options are explained, perhaps needs a little more context there.
