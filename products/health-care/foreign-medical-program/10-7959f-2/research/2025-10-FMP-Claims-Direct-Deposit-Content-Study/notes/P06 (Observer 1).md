**Introduction**
- Notes

**Warm-up Questions**
- 100% disability rating
- Receives compensation
- Vaguely knows of the FMP

**First Task - Intro Page**
- Question on if they can go anywhere (any medical location/provider) that will accept VA insurance
     - Seems to conflate this program with having “VA Insurance” and concerned locations will not accept it.
- Remembers Intro page referencing uploading docs and how the program works
- Rates clarity at a 5


**Second Task - Direct Deposit Static Page**
- Likes the steps, seems pretty easy
- Likes that the phone number is at the top instead of the bottom
- Likes the bulleted list of info to have ready
- Website - put in your info - call if you need it
- Rated instructions at a 5

**Pause Page - Comparison Question**
- Process would be the same
- Claims is similar, seems like maybe more paperwork might need to be submitted

**Third Task - FMP Form Flow and Upload**
- Confused about the provider paid line, what kind of payments does this mean/refer to?
- what allows you to go to the VA to be seen? Wants to know “Am I covered”, before I get seen.
- only feedback on upload page was to include a line to state that the Veteran will receive a confirmation that the claim has been sent to FMP

**Fourth Task - Confirmation Page**
- Confidence on Direct Deposit rated at a 5
- Instructions were detailed
- There isn't anything on this that would stop them from filing their claim online.

**Fifth Task - Content Comprehension & Mental Model**
- Thoughts on using phone number to contact VA for assistance on setting up DD
     - It is good when it works, sometimes on hold for an hour or so, sometimes get disconnected
     - How about a Chat button?  Call back feature would be good too
- Submission info and being able to print the PDF at confirmation makes them feel confident that the claim is submitted successfully

**Post-Task Interview**
- No feedback on content
- No questions for the interviewer

**Additional Notes**
- N/A
