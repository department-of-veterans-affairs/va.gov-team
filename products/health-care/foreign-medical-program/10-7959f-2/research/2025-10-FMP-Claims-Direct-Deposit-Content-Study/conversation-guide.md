### Day of the session

### Starting the session


# Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is **[NAME]** and **[NOTETAKER NAME]** is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them... 

Today we're going to talk about content around direct deposit for Foreign Medical Program Claims.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- **This entire session should take about 30-60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
  
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
  
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
  
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - <mark>**If no:** Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.</mark>
   - **If yes:** Admit observers.
     
> [!TIP]
> - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to **give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov.** (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)
> - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth
     
- *(If applicable)* **You'll be interacting with a prototype today.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. <mark>**Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.**</mark>
  
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.
   - **Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**

   <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>
     
- **Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences?** One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image. Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not, but we like to ask ahead of time. At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.
   - **Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?**
 
   <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>

   - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.**

➡️ **Start recording.**

> [!TIP]
> After you start the recording, click the Show captions (CC) button to enable transcription for the recording.

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

 <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>
 
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?**

 <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>

# Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

1. Do you have a service-connected disability at VA?
- If yes: do you mind sharing what your disability rating is ?
- Do you receive direct deposit for your monthly compensation payments via direct deposit today?
- If no, skip to question 2.
2. Have you ever heard of the Foreign Medical Program through the VA before?
  - If so, are you registered?
  - Can you describe what it is in your own words?
  - Have you ever filed a reimbursement claim before?
  

## First Task: [Introduction Page] - 5 minutes

- [ ] Open mobile Figma prototype - link to go here when ready
- I am going to share a link with you to a mobile prototype today. As mentioned, this is a test site and won't function fully.
- Open the prototype and take a minute to look it over and please remember to think aloud.
- Based on this page, what would you do next if you were filing your first FMP claim today?
- [ ] Have participant click anywhere to get to pause screen before asking the next two questions.
- Can you state in your own words what the information and alert on that previous page meant?
- On a scale of 1-5, 1 being very difficult and 5 being very easy, what would you rate the clarity of information on this first page?

> [!NOTE]
> ### Things to watch for:
> - [Does the participant mention anything about the direct deposit informational alert on the intro page?]
> - [Does the participant notice the link of how to setup direct deposit or do they call out the phone number to call?]
> - [Is the participant aware their bank account information needs to be in different systems within the VA - FMP is separate from VA Benefits?]
> - [Does the participant pass over the alert with the mental model of they already have it set up?]

## Second Task: [Direct Deposit Static Page] - 5 minutes

- [ ] From pause screen, click continue to get to static page.
- Now take a minute to look over this page on direct deposit for the Foreign Medical Program.
- What are your impressions of this page and your understanding of the content here? Please remember to think aloud.
- [ ] Have participant click anywhere to get to pause screen before asking the next two questions.
- [ ] Can you state in your own words the process to set up direct deposit for FMP claims?
- Same as before, on a scale of 1-5, 1 being very difficult and 5 being very easy, what would you rate the instructions on that previous page?
- Would you call out anything on this page as being either especially helpful or confusing for you?
  

> [!NOTE]
> ### Things to watch for:
> - [Does the participant understand that the process to setup their account for FMP claims is separate from VA benefits?]
> - [Does the participant call out this separate process and really difficult or just a one-time thing they have to do during setup?]
> - [Does the process stepper componennt and contnet help or add clarity to the process?]


## Third Task: [FMP Form Flow and Upload] - 10 minutes

- [ ] From static page pause screen, have participant click continue to jump through the form.
- Now we are going to go back to the form for filing the claim. Imagine that you have navigated through pages that ask you to confirm you basic information and then you arrive here. 
- Navigate through the prototype now focusing on the content and instructions - you don't need to enter anything into the fields, just keep clicking the continue button after you review and talk through your thought process on each page. 
- [ ] Pause before starting upload screens
- Before moving on, can you explain your understanding of the content on that previous page?
- [ ] Upload screens
- Again, we won't ask you to upload any documentation or interact with the prototype fully here either. But can you think aloud as you go through this page and call out anything that isn't clear or you would like there to be explanation on.


> [!NOTE]
> ### Things to watch for:
> - [Does the participant interact with the additional information component to learn more about direct deposit later in the flow?]
> - [Does the participant have any concerns or confusion with the upload documentation content?]



## Third Task: [Confirmation Page] - 10 minutes


- [ ] Participant arrives at Confirmation Page in the Figma prototype
- Now this is the page where you have submitted your FMP Claim online. Can you explain to me your understanding of what happens next and any action you might need to take?
- What is your confidence rating - 1 being very low and 5 being very high - that you have direct deposit correctly set up based on this prototype and this page here?

> [!NOTE]
> ### Things to watch for:
> - [Does the participant notice the direct deposit information on the confirmation page and call it out as being redundant or helpful?]




## Forth Task: [Content Comprehension and Mental Model] - 10 minutes

- What's your understanding on how the direct deposit process for FMP claims works now that you have gone thorugh this prototype?
- What would be one thing that you would change to make it better for you about the current direct deposit process as you understand it?
- Can you describe to me your ideal experience with setting up and maintaining direct deposit for your Foreign Medical Program claims?

> [!NOTE]
> ### Things to watch for:
> - [Does the participant bring up any other systems or experiences that they say are exceptionally good or bad?]
> - [Does the current mental model conflict or align with the current state?]




# Post-Task Interview - 2 minutes
- Do you have any additional feedback about the content we went over today?
- Any questions for me? 

## Consent to use video clips

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that **you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?** Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
   - **If yes:** Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?
 
   <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>


## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!


# Emergency Exit 🚨

In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). <mark>**Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.**</mark>
