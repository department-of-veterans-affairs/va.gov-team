## Research Goals

1. Understand perceived content comprehension for the topic of direct deposit specifically for FMP claims.
2. Discover, if any, of the direct deposit content is confusing or misunderstood by the Veteran and could be a potential risk.
3. Gain insight into any improvements that could be made to increase clairity of the direct deposit process understanding for FMP claims for reimbursement.

**Guiding Questions:**  
- What are the key moments this tool supports in the Veteran’s journey?  
- What outcomes are we aiming to achieve for Veterans and stakeholders?  

[Example Research Goals](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/initiatives/2021-post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#research-goals) 

## Research Questions

- How do Veterans react to the direct deposit informational alert on the introduction page?
- Do Veterans most often click to the static page to "learn how to setup" or do they stay in the form flow?
- Do Veterans confuse or quickly assume that their bank account information for FMP is the same as what they use for disability compensation?
- Do Veterans express frustration about the separate direct deposit setup process for FMP claims and if so, what is their biggest pain point?
- Do any Veterans say the direct deposit process mentioned in the content would be a blocker for them in filing online?
- How confident are Veterans in their understanding to set up direct deposit for FMP claims?

## Methodology 
- Semi-structured moderated interviews with a mid-fidelity Figma prototype  


## Hypotheses and Conclusions

*List hypotheses explored in the research and the conclusions drawn. If applicable, list the success or task completion rate.*


- **Hypothesis Statement:** We assume that overall there will be some confusion about direct deposit being a separate process than what is used for VA Benefits when Veterans are filing an FMP claim. 
  - **"Maybe True", “Likely True”, “Definitely True”, “Likely False”, “Definitely False” or “Not enough information”**  
  - Supporting evidence  


- **Hypothesis Statement:** Some Veterans will not have an issue with the one-time setup instructions directed to FSC, but may comment on it being incovenient.
  - **"Maybe True", “Likely True”, “Definitely True”, “Likely False”, “Definitely False” or “Not enough information”**  
  - Supporting evidence  



## Key Findings

*Summarize the 5–10 most impactful findings from your study.* 

> [!TIP] 
> Write findings as stand-alone insights that are easy to scan. For example:  
> - "Most participants used the search field to locate forms, often searching for 'veteran health.'"  
> - "Participants struggled with the secondary caregiver section on the form."
