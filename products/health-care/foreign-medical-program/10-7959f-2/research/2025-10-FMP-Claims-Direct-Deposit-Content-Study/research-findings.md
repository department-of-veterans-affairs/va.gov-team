## Research Goals

1. Understand perceived content comprehension for the topic of direct deposit specifically for FMP claims.
2. Discover if any of the direct deposit content is confusing or misunderstood by the Veteran and could be a potential risk.
3. Gain insight into any improvements that could be made to increase clarity of the direct deposit process understanding for FMP claims for reimbursement.

## Research Questions

- How do Veterans react to the direct deposit informational alert on the introduction page?
- Do Veterans most often click to the static page to "learn how to setup" or do they stay in the form flow?
- Do Veterans confuse or quickly assume that their bank account information for FMP is the same as what they use for disability compensation?
- Do Veterans express frustration about the separate direct deposit setup process for FMP claims and if so, what is their biggest pain point?
- Do any Veterans say the direct deposit process mentioned in the content would be a blocker for them in filing online?
- How confident are Veterans in their understanding to set up direct deposit for FMP claims?

## Methodology 
- Semi-structured moderated interviews with a mid-fidelity Figma prototype  


## Hypotheses and Conclusions


- **Hypothesis 1:** We assume that overall there will be some confusion about direct deposit being a separate process than what is used for VA Benefits when Veterans are filing an FMP claim. 
  - **"Maybe True"**
  - Finding 5: Four participants expressed or suggested that the direct deposit process for FMP was confusing in relation of their current direct deposit setup they have for monthly disability compensation payments.  


- **Hypothesis 2:** Some Veterans will not have an issue with the one-time setup instructions directed to FSC, but may comment on it being inconvenient.
  - **“Likely True”**  
  - There was a mix of participants self-reporting that the content was easy to understand and clear while at the same time there being some point of confusion around new terms or processes mentioned.
  - Introduction Page Clarity Rating: Average 4.75
  - Static Page Clarity Rating: Average 4
  - Confidence Post Rating: Average 4.71



## Key Findings

1. 6 out of the 8 participants felt the introduction page content was clear with easy to understand instructions and they rated the page the highest with an average of 4.75 out of 5 for clarity.
2. 7 of 8 participants mentioned document gathering more prominently than stating they would need to setup direct deposit first when on the introduction page. 
3. Participants called out the content and language around the Financial Services Center (FSC), other Vendor File Form, or PIV as new terms to them that would need additional clarification or they suggested improvements. 
4. The static page seemed to be the most confusing for participants, partly due to new terminology and processes they have not encountered at the VA before, and it also received the lowest rating for ease-of-use at an average of 4 out of 5.
5. Half of the participants (4 of 8) expressed or suggested that the direct deposit process for FMP was confusing in relation of their current direct deposit for monthly disability compensation payments.



## Details of Findings 


### Finding 1: 6 out of the 8 participants felt the introduction page content was clear with easy to understand instructions and they rated the page the highest with an average of 4.75 out of 5 for clarity.
Participants reported the content on the introduction page as being clear and easy to understand. They mentioned gathering documents in preparation to file a claim, and clicking on the link to learn more about what documents would be needed. 
- 6 of 8 participants found the content of the Intro Page to be clear and easy to follow
- 4 of 8 participants explicitly indicated that the "What you need to do before you apply" instructions on the intro page were clear and easy to follow 
- 3 of 8 showed content comprehension during the recall task, explaining the claims process completely


> _Oh, yeah, it was basically kind of instructions on how to file a claim, for foreign for any foreign medical service that I may have received for my service-related disabilities, and then… yeah, just, you know, the things that I need, a link to getting more information for what I need, and then that link that I clicked to get started. (P5)_ [Restating content but did not call out setting up direct deposit before filing a claim.]

> _It seemed pretty straightforward and clear. (P5)_

> _But again, it looks like two separate things. This one is the file cover sheet, but then, separately, it's also talking about setting up direct deposit specifically for this.(P2)_



### Finding 2: 7 of 8 participants mentioned document gathering more prominently than stating they would need to setup direct deposit first when on the introduction page.   
Almost all participants called out the documents they needed to gather and the link to find out what supporting documents would be needed. This was more prominent in users' initial reaction to the introduction page and recall as a first step before setting up or calling out the direct deposit content.



> _I see I need at least a billing statement and if I paid, a receipt. If I was doing this for real, I'd click the link to check if the claim I'm filing for requires a certain type of document. (P5)_

> _I would, knowing that this information here about what I need to prepare before, I'd make sure I have all that information available. I'm always looking for that extra layer of information so I'd click that link here in this supporting documents and make notes of what documents do I need to prepare before I went to fill out the form. (P7)_



### Finding 3: Participants called out the content and language around the Financial Services Center (FSC), other Vendor File Form, and PIV as new terms to them that would need additional clarification or they suggested improvements. 
Confusion around these terms was a contributing factor to the lower clarity rating on the static page and subsequent confusion during the recall task. These terms were unfamiliar to participants and they wanted more explanation or definition around them.  
- 4 of 8 participants were unsure what exactly the FSC is, and expressed confusion over it.
- 3 of 8 participants called out the Vendor File Form as confusing, or they would want more information about it.


> _Vendor file form is new. Don't understand who the Vendor is. (P2)_

> _"So [Step] 4, complete the VA Vendor File Form? Is that your bank? The Vendor File form. They don’t ‘think banks are vendors, they think banks are banks. (P8)_

> _One change: the Vendor Information, because they have no experience dealing with it. It would be helpful to have a representative walk you through it. (P4)_


- ### Finding 4: The static page seemed to be the most confusing for participants, partly due to new terminology and processes they have not encountered at the VA before. It also received the lowest rating for ease-of-use at an average of 4 out of 5.  
As mentioned in Finding 3, there was new terminology on the instruction static page that participants had never seen or heard of before: Financial Services Center, FSC, Vendor File Form and VA PIV were all mentioned. Every participant called out at least one of these terms as being new to them. Some participants expressed more confusion and concern than others: some participants stated the page was clear with step by step instructions.  
- 5 out of 8 participants mentioned the sign-in process with 4 of them having a negative sentiment.
- 4 out of 8 participants was unsure what the FSC (Financial Services Center site) is and expressed confusion over it.


> _Reference to FSC. [That's a] new term for me. (P2)_

> _This Vendor file form, because I didn’t have to deal with it, I know nothing about it. (P4)_

> _[A] little more consistency in how the FSC Customer Support Portal was labeled across all content. Use the same abbreviations across the steps and sections. (P5)_


- ### Finding 5: 4 of 8 participants expressed or suggested that the direct deposit process for FMP was confusing in relation of their current direct deposit setup they have for monthly disability compensation payments.  
All participants self-reported during the warm up questions that they had a disability rating and receive monthly compensation via direct deposit today. There was a mix of participants' understanding that direct deposit mentioned in relation to the Foreign Medical Program had to be set up specifically for FMP claims, with some participants thinking that their setup for disability compensation would prefill and apply to FMP Claims automatically.   
- 4 of 8 participants mentioned some sort of confusion with VBA direct deposit for disability compensation payments.
- 1 participant clearly re-iterated he expected to see something in the form flow about the account where the deposit will be sent.
  
> _Well.. not that you have sent me to a direct deposit page, I am confused. IF I am already getting VA benefits, and having it direct deposited, why wouldn’t I use that account? (P8)_  

> _For me, I already have direct deposit established, so these instructions are redundant. (P3)_ [Seemed to be referring to their monthly disability compensation]

> _I guess again it is self-explanatory, especially if you already went through the process to sign up for FSC. I don’t recall signing up for that, when eBenefits switch, all my information transferred over. Had benefits since 2011. (P4)_

## Additional Insights

1. 4 of 8 participants said on the confirmation page or post-questions that they would expect to see their status of their FMP claim when they log in to VA.gov.
- _Supporting quote: "An online portal for claims submission, has been a desire for those of us who live overseas make it much easier." (P7)_

2. 2 of 8 participants commented that they expected to see verification of their bank account where the reimbursement will be sent within the form flow itself and not in another portal/site.
- _Supporting quote: "I want something that says "hey yes this is a real banking, true and accurate institution...something that says hey yeah we received your direct deposit information and everything checks out" (P7)_

3. 4 of 8 participants commented that signing in with ID.me was a pain point or that they did not know what a PIV was when they were going through the direct deposit static page instructions. 
- _Supporting quote: "For overseas Veterans, the forced implementation of ID.me; is a struggle. They're not in the states often enough to get new licenses/IDs. It is a "death loop" for video confirmation." (P2)_
