00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:09.630
Moderator: Okay, I have started the recording, and I'd like to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

2
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:10.360
P8: Yes.

3
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:19.389
Moderator: Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?

4
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:20.520
P8: Yes.

5
00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:30.760
Moderator: Alright, thank you. So, before we look at that prototype that I mentioned before, we have just a few warm-up questions. Do you have a service-connected disability at VA?

6
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:31.480
P8: Yes.

7
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.640
Moderator: Okay, do you mind sharing what your disability rating is?

8
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.090
P8: 100%.

9
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:44.289
Moderator: Okay, and do you res… Okay, do you receive direct deposit for your monthly compensation payments today?

10
00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:45.030
P8: They do.

11
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.210
Moderator: Okay, and have you heard of the Foreign Medical Program through the VA before?

12
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.689
P8: Yes, I'm signed up for it.

13
00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.099
Moderator: Awesome, okay. Can you describe what the program is in your own words?

14
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.120
P8: Minimally.

15
00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:16.460
P8: Basically, if I travel overseas, and if I need medical attention, I can go to one of the hospitals overseas, and the VA will somehow reimburse me. I don't know any of those specifics?

16
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:23.090
P8: When I was talking to a VA rep a few years ago, he suggested I sign up for it when I was overseas.

17
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:24.190
Moderator: Oh, great.

18
00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.630
P8: Probably.

19
00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:34.030
Moderator: I'm curious, who… was the rep at, like, a VA medical facility or regional office, or was it an accredited representative? Who mentioned the program to you?

20
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.110
P8: No, it was a VA employee. I think I had called, asking about

21
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:48.760
P8: veterans' benefits. I don't know if I… I can't remember what I was specifically calling about, but we were talking about something, and he recommended this.

22
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:49.799
Moderator: Got it.

23
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.230
P8: As a tangential issue.

24
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.530
P8: So I said, oh, I'll sign up for it.

25
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.250
Moderator: Did you have any issues with the registration or sign-up process?

26
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.280
P8: No, none.

27
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.800
P8: Right here, very easy, one sheet.

28
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.280
Moderator: Okay. And it sounds like you haven't used the benefit before, is that correct?

29
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.750
P8: Correct, haven't used it yet.

30
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.189
Moderator: Okay, gotcha. Are you on a mobile device today, or a laptop desktop computer?

31
00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.090
P8: Desktop.

32
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:34.190
Moderator: Okay, thank you. So at this point in the session, I'm gonna share a link with you in the Zoom chat. Once you have it loaded, if you can share your screen, and let me know if you have, any difficulty with the screen sharing process, and I'm more than happy to,

33
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.430
Moderator: Troubleshoot that with you.

34
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.000
P8: Alright?

35
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.749
Moderator: That is the wrong link.

36
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.220
Moderator: Hold on one second…

37
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.449
P8: Now, I don't have the chat function… oh, the chat. You want me to put the chat on?

38
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:54.339
Moderator: If you can open the chat for me, that would be great, while I am digging up the correct link for you.

39
00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.639
Moderator: Didn't paste correctly.

40
00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.410
P8: Alright.

41
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.339
Moderator: Okay, I have shared that in the chat.

42
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.540
P8: Alright, I see it.

43
00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.660
Moderator: So go ahead and open that in a browser, and then once it's loaded, if you could share your screen.

44
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.730
P8: Alright, we moved on to a different screen.

45
00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.689
P8: Okay, share my screen.

46
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.640
P8: I have this on a separate screen.

47
00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.350
P8: So… Do you want me to share this?

48
00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:46.860
Moderator: So in Zoom, there's a big green button that should say, like, share, and it'll give you a couple of options. You can either share just the browser, or you can share your whole screen. We usually recommend just sharing your browser so we don't see anything else.

49
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.779
Moderator: That you might not want shared during the session.

50
00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.479
P8: Say, hold to select who.

51
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:55.339
P8: Do you see it now?

52
00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.760
Moderator: Nope.

53
00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:59.569
P8: That's screen 2.

54
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.139
P8: See, I have screen 1.

55
00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.409
P8: I can share it.

56
00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:12.329
P8: You see it?

57
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:16.740
Moderator: No.

58
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:17.180
P8: fun.

59
00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:23.559
Moderator: Are you getting a pop-up that's showing you your different sharing options once you click that green button?

60
00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.099
Moderator: And are you… you're selecting, like, screen 2?

61
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.980
P8: I am.

62
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.639
Moderator: And then are you clicking… I think it's a button that says broadcast or share?

63
00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.290
P8: Oh, it says, Quinton Wyoming.

64
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:36.330
P8: You know what?

65
00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.940
P8: Let me, let me get out of this thing. I just… do you want me to share it with you, regularly?

66
00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.430
Moderator: Yeah, yeah.

67
00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.520
P8: Alright.

68
00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.229
P8: Let's share, let's do share again. Okay, share.

69
00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.210
P8: Alright, so what do you want me to do now? I have…

70
00:04:55.010 --> 00:05:10.790
Moderator: Typically, we just recommend selecting the browser that you have the prototype open in, it's one of your sharing options. It's usually, like, you can share your whole screen or just the browser. So select the browser, and then there should be a button that says share once you've selected it.

71
00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.220
Moderator: or start share.

72
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.100
P8: Sesame River.

73
00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.890
P8: It's asking me to,

74
00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:31.780
P8: Oh, I see how you do this.

75
00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.260
P8: Huh.

76
00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.540
P8: How about,

77
00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.139
P8: Let me see if I can get through this.

78
00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.440
Moderator: Is it asking you to change your permissions with the Zoom app, by chance? Yes.

79
00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.100
P8: Okay.

80
00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:01.760
P8: Is it sharing now?

81
00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:04.120
Moderator: Nope.

82
00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.130
P8: It'll quit and reopen.

83
00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:15.269
Moderator: Yeah, if you change your settings, it does force you to, like, leave and come back. Are you comfortable with doing that? I can let you right back into the Zoom session.

84
00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.830
P8: Yeah.

85
00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:19.740
Moderator: Okay, I will be here, and I will let you back in.

86
00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:25.570
P8: But how… but how… if I close this screen right here, how do I open it on, let me get out of that thing.

87
00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.389
P8: Let's see, what is this? This is,

88
00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:34.730
P8: I put this in the middle and do this. Oh, it opens it on one of my other, screens.

89
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:36.789
P8: Oh, I know what I'm used to.

90
00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:41.370
P8: Let me, let me, is he very close, yes.

91
00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:45.930
P8: I'm sorry about the confusion.

92
00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:52.889
Moderator: No, no, it's totally fine. I feel like Zoom changes everything on me every couple of months, so…

93
00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:56.659
P8: Alright, how's that now?

94
00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:02.559
Moderator: I'm still not seeing anything. You might still need to leave and come back to the Zoom meeting.

95
00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.009
Moderator: If it's asking you to change your…

96
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:08.299
P8: It's not. I'm on my desktop here.

97
00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:09.320
Moderator: Hmm.

98
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:14.589
Moderator: Well, in that case, I can, share my screen.

99
00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:15.070
P8: was.

100
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:20.540
Moderator: So that we can… and you can sort of dictate as we're going through. How does that sound?

101
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:21.650
P8: Sounds good.

102
00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:23.050
Moderator: Alright.

103
00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:25.709
P8: Oh yeah, now I'm back to this thing here.

104
00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:37.120
P8: back, get out of that. Now, I… I see it, you are… Europe on the top left.

105
00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:38.320
Moderator: Okay.

106
00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:39.630
P8: You don't see this, huh?

107
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:42.689
Moderator: No, unfortunately, I do not.

108
00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:46.590
Moderator: But…

109
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:55.960
Moderator: Do you want to exit… is it showing you that you're sharing on your side? Because if so, if you want to close out of that, I'll share my screen, and we'll just go from there.

110
00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.690
P8: Well, now I think I'm, like, totally confused in here.

111
00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:03.990
P8: Now I have no, oh, there we go.

112
00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:05.710
P8: Alright.

113
00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.250
Moderator: Okay. What do you want me to do? I can share on my side.

114
00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:13.849
P8: screen with my chat on the right side there.

115
00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:15.520
Moderator: Perfect, perfect.

116
00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:23.629
Moderator: If… as long as you can see me, I can share on my end, and we can… we can go from there. How does that sound? Sounds good.

117
00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.310
Moderator: Alright.

118
00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:36.900
Moderator: So basically, how this is gonna work is you get to kind of boss me around, I'll share my screen, you'll tell me if you want me to move or click on something, and then other than that, I'll have some questions for you, but…

119
00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:43.240
Moderator: Clicking the share button… Okay…

120
00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:51.119
Moderator: Alright, so you should see that prototype that I sent you that you may have already loaded. Okay, gotcha.

121
00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.770
P8: Why didn't that come up?

122
00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:54.270
P8: So easy.

123
00:08:56.910 --> 00:09:00.899
Moderator: You know, it's Monday. Maybe Zoom's having a case of the Mondays.

124
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:12.120
Moderator: So, we're gonna look at… as I mentioned before, this is a prototype, so some of the functions in the site might not work quite the way you expect.

125
00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:24.689
Moderator: But we're just gonna take a look at this for a minute. You can let me know when you're done reading something and you want to scroll up or down, but thinking aloud, just review the information on this page, and once you're done, I'll ask you some questions.

126
00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:44.150
P8: Alright, you can, scroll up.

127
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:47.120
P8: Alright, set up direct deposit, that's fine.

128
00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:48.290
P8: Okay.

129
00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:59.400
Moderator: Alright, okay. So, based on this page, what would you do next if you were filing your first FMP claim today?

130
00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:06.729
P8: Find out which, supporting documents…

131
00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.630
Moderator: This, this link right here?

132
00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:10.440
P8: Yeah, yeah, that's where you need to go, right?

133
00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:16.900
Moderator: Okay, what would you do after figuring out what supporting documents you need for your claim? Anything else?

134
00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:18.420
P8: Go to the supporting document.

135
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:28.980
Moderator: Okay, gotcha. And let's say that you've done that, you've collected, say, any bills or invoices that you need, anything else that you would do at this point?

136
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:36.170
P8: I don't think so. Is there anything more on the bottom? Can you scroll up again?

137
00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:39.349
P8: This way? Get started.

138
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:39.879
Moderator: So you can…

139
00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.079
P8: Yeah, click on that.

140
00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:43.690
Moderator: Okay, gotcha.

141
00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:44.079
P8: See that?

142
00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:47.419
Moderator: So, I'm gonna go ahead and click on the Get Started link.

143
00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:48.279
P8: Click on it.

144
00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:56.679
Moderator: So here we are, in your own words, can you state the information and the alert that you saw on the previous page?

145
00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:07.330
P8: No, you can go back.

146
00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:12.469
Moderator: Just anything that you remember, anything that stood out to you.

147
00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:13.710
P8: stood out.

148
00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:15.040
Moderator: Yeah, yeah.

149
00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:19.709
P8: No, because I thought the instructions were pretty clear.

150
00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:21.510
Moderator: Okay, gotcha.

151
00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:24.809
P8: So I didn't have any, issues with the special instructions.

152
00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:34.799
Moderator: Gotcha, gotcha. On a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being very difficult, 5 being very easy, how would you rate the clarity of information that you saw on that first page?

153
00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:38.110
P8: Very easy. What is it, 5?

154
00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:39.709
Moderator: A 5? Okay.

155
00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:40.400
P8: easy.

156
00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:41.879
Moderator: Yes, that's very easy.

157
00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:47.170
P8: Right. The only change I would make is I would make the Get Started button larger.

158
00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:48.750
Moderator: Bigger? Okay.

159
00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:49.210
P8: Yes.

160
00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:50.370
Moderator: That is fair.

161
00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:55.740
P8: Or I would put it… or I'd put it close to that, you know, the forms that you need.

162
00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:58.310
Moderator: Okay, got it.

163
00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:01.380
P8: It's not confusing. Which one do you click?

164
00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:02.980
Moderator: Yeah, yeah.

165
00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:07.070
Moderator: Get started in front of that paragraph.

166
00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:10.019
P8: If you need additional forms for any crazy ideas.

167
00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:13.140
Moderator: This one right here, you would put it up here.

168
00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:19.480
P8: Well, for certain types of claims, you may need other supporting documents. Okay, well… Alright, well…

169
00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:26.880
P8: I want to get started first. I don't know if I need any supporting documents yet, or what other type of claim it is.

170
00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:29.880
Moderator: Mmm, okay. Got a shot.

171
00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:30.580
P8: on that?

172
00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:32.089
Moderator: Yeah, I think I do.

173
00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:33.560
P8: I'm gonna submit a claim.

174
00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:34.670
P8: Alright?

175
00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:40.850
P8: So, for certain types of claims, but it doesn't differentiate the different types of claims.

176
00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:42.820
P8: So, I just want to know

177
00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:46.010
P8: I just want to do a standard claim and get started.

178
00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:56.439
Moderator: Okay. Would there be any additional information you would want to see here to let you know, like, yeah, I'm good, I don't need anything else, we can just click the Get Started link, or…

179
00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:02.309
P8: Yeah, I wouldn't put it… I wouldn't put it right…

180
00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:05.039
P8: After the second, bullet point.

181
00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:08.080
Moderator: Okay.

182
00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:09.390
Moderator: Got it.

183
00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:14.259
P8: Yeah, in between the second and third, and get started. I think for that certain type of claim.

184
00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:20.740
P8: For other supporting documents, you know, that may be one in a hundred types of claims, but that's not a standard claim, it sounds like.

185
00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:22.680
Moderator: Okay.

186
00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:26.040
P8: I think most people are pretty standard, so they want to get started.

187
00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:27.820
Moderator: Yeah.

188
00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:28.370
P8: Clear.

189
00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:49.310
Moderator: I hear you on that. Thank you for that feedback. I'm gonna click that Get Started button again. I'm gonna whiz past this page we already looked at. So, now I'd like you to take a minute and look over this page about direct deposit for the foreign medical program. And again, feel free to think out loud as you're reading it, and let me know when you're ready for me to scroll up or down.

190
00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:58.860
P8: All right. Well, I f… I figured out… well, I filed the,

191
00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:05.350
P8: the application, I don't know if I linked a direct deposit account to it.

192
00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:07.380
Moderator: Okay.

193
00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:08.870
P8: FSC Portal.

194
00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:18.460
P8: Alright, is there…

195
00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:32.159
P8: Alright, is there anything, different about the direct deposit account for this than receiving VA benefits?

196
00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:43.900
Moderator: I'm gonna be a little annoying and answer your question with another question. Based on what you're seeing on this page, is it your understanding that they're the same, or your understanding that they're different?

197
00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:51.030
P8: Well, now that you've sent me to a direct deposit page.

198
00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:56.479
P8: I'm confused, because if I'm already getting VA benefits.

199
00:14:56.700 --> 00:15:00.069
P8: And I'm having them direct deposit… deposited.

200
00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:03.709
P8: why don't I just use that account?

201
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:05.130
Moderator: Okay.

202
00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:13.679
P8: So, I guess the question is here is, if you have… if you're receiving VA benefits and have an established direct deposit account.

203
00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:15.500
P8: Click here.

204
00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:17.120
Moderator: Okay.

205
00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:22.730
P8: You don't have an established direct deposit account, Clicked, you know, number 2.

206
00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:31.440
Moderator: Okay, so if you had a magic wand that you could wave to change this, you would want some sort of call-out that sort of says, if you're already receiving

207
00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:47.209
Moderator: VA disability benefits via direct deposit, go here, or proceed with this form, versus if you need to set it up new. Okay, got it. I'm going to continue to scroll down the page, feel free to take a look at the content, and then once you're done, I'll ask you a few more questions.

208
00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:47.920
P8: Okay.

209
00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:53.839
Moderator: And let me know if you want me to scroll up or down.

210
00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:56.800
P8: No, set up direct deposit, standard stuff.

211
00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:03.089
P8: Alright, what is the Financial Services Center?

212
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:11.720
Moderator: I'm gonna do that annoying thing again where I ask another question. Have you ever heard of that? Does Financial Services Center mean anything to you?

213
00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:14.850
P8: No. Is it the VA Financial Services Center?

214
00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:21.529
Moderator: Okay. Would you want any additional context or description here? Yes. Okay.

215
00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:38.460
P8: VA… if it's the VA Financial Services Center, sign into the VA Financial Services Center, where it says number 3, sign into the Financial Services Center, sign into the VA Financial Services Center, as opposed to the Chase Bank Financial Services Center.

216
00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:44.099
Moderator: Gotcha. So you want to know if this is a VA thing. You go to number 4.

217
00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:47.740
P8: Complete the VA FSC vendor file form.

218
00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:53.749
P8: Right? You see? So… You know, if you have the…

219
00:16:54.500 --> 00:17:04.679
P8: financial services center there, why don't they have in a, you know, paragraph next to it, FSC. So in the next paragraph, you can identify what FSC

220
00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:08.210
P8: V, or S… F… SC is.

221
00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:09.690
Moderator: Gotcha.

222
00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:10.219
P8: So you don't know.

223
00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:10.819
Moderator: I…

224
00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:12.449
P8: You know, listen, these vets.

225
00:17:12.569 --> 00:17:23.969
P8: Listen, I'm a colonel. I write… I used to write orders. I used to write these things, alright? So, you gotta write this thing for, you know, the enlisted man, and they're gonna ask all of these questions.

226
00:17:25.029 --> 00:17:26.899
P8: That's why it needs to be a little clearer.

227
00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:45.220
Moderator: Gotcha. So I just want to repeat back some of what I'm hearing. On Step 3, you'd really like it to identify that this is a VA institution or a VA portal, so VA Financial Services Center, and it sounded like you wanted a little bit of an additional description of what that means, so that Step 4 would.

228
00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:50.379
P8: Oh, no sense. No, I just wanted to know what… I just wanted to know whose financial services center it is.

229
00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:56.039
Moderator: Okay, gotcha. See, this is why I like to repeat back. I want to make sure I'm hearing correctly.

230
00:17:57.010 --> 00:17:58.890
Moderator: Okay. Alright.

231
00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:03.210
P8: Are they, are they recording? Is someone recording?

232
00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.679
Moderator: I am recording right now.

233
00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:07.940
P8: No, no, I'm talking a note-taker and everything.

234
00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:09.510
Moderator: Yeah, they're taking notes.

235
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:10.240
P8: Okay.

236
00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:13.440
P8: I'll write down what I think that should look like.

237
00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:14.250
Moderator: Okay.

238
00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:16.730
P8: Sign in.

239
00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:19.390
P8: B. A…

240
00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:33.940
P8: Alright.

241
00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:41.419
Moderator: I can see it. Yes, I can see it.

242
00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:47.529
P8: Number 3, VA, sign into the VA Financial Services Center.

243
00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:51.750
P8: Apo, you know,

244
00:18:53.250 --> 00:19:06.130
P8: parentheses FSC, because when you go down to paragraph 4, it asks you to complete the VA FSC. Well, I don't know what FSC is unless you identify it up top.

245
00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:08.040
P8: Yeah.

246
00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:16.600
Moderator: Yeah, I got you. Thank you for that feedback, I appreciate that. Do you want me to scroll up or down anymore before I ask you some questions about this page?

247
00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:22.529
P8: No, that's good.

248
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:23.840
Moderator: Right?

249
00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:27.149
P8: Well, I, you know, I don't know what a… And, and number 3.

250
00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:31.069
Moderator: If you don't have a VA PIV, I don't know what a PIV is.

251
00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:39.289
Moderator: Oh, gotcha, gotcha. Are you familiar with ID.me? Do you have an account that uses ID.me as a login?

252
00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:43.960
P8: I… You're writing this thing for privates. I do.

253
00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:45.030
Moderator: Okay.

254
00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:48.320
P8: I'm asking the question, I'm wondering myself.

255
00:19:50.760 --> 00:20:01.409
Moderator: Yeah, I think that, the non-civilian version of a PIV is a CAC card, I think is what I've heard them called, but at VA, they're called PIV, so that's what that is.

256
00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:03.159
Moderator: Just for your awareness.

257
00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:04.140
P8: VA system?

258
00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:05.160
Moderator: Yeah.

259
00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:06.440
P8: They do?

260
00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:08.649
Moderator: No, no, I'm talking about patients.

261
00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:12.739
Moderator: Oh, no, I'm not sure, actually, that's a good question.

262
00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:14.220
P8: Yeah, what's a PIV?

263
00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:20.929
Moderator: Any other questions or feedback about this before I ask you some questions?

264
00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:21.760
P8: No.

265
00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:28.609
Moderator: Okay. So what are your first impressions and understanding of the content on this page?

266
00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:33.100
P8: Can you, scroll down?

267
00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:34.650
Moderator: All the way down.

268
00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:38.339
P8: No, no, up so I can see the top.

269
00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:39.210
Moderator: Yeah, yeah.

270
00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:42.920
P8: Yeah, alright, so… Yeah, I… I understand that.

271
00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:43.900
P8: Right.

272
00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:44.470
Moderator: Okay.

273
00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:51.569
P8: And there you go with the, if you've used the FSC portal before, you know, that's… FSE portal.

274
00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:54.129
P8: Okay, you gotta get your acronyms right.

275
00:20:55.200 --> 00:21:02.110
P8: FMP, direct deposit, Foreign… foreign medical program.

276
00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:12.030
P8: Again, if you're going to use these abbreviations, you have to, you know, put a parentheses and put that abbreviation in there. Foreign Medical Program, parentheses, FMP.

277
00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:18.240
P8: Oh yeah, you have it right there. You have it right there in the second paragraph. Yeah, but you don't have it in the first paragraph.

278
00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:19.279
Moderator: Oh, right here.

279
00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:25.489
P8: I see it, yeah. I mean, I'm nitpicking the, the form, but I'm trying to understand what's on this form.

280
00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:37.299
P8: All right, yeah, no, I understand. Set up direct deposit, if you don't already have it. But on the previous page, I think it needs to be clear. Do you have direct deposit or not?

281
00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:38.990
Moderator: Okay, gotcha.

282
00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:48.790
Moderator: So now, in your own words, could you state the process and in what order you would have to set up direct deposit for FMP claims?

283
00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:57.470
P8: Yeah, makes sense. I mean, it's… number one is a yes or no.

284
00:21:58.250 --> 00:22:00.630
P8: If it's a no, go to number 2.

285
00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:02.380
Moderator: Okay.

286
00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:04.270
P8: Say, yes, go to number 3, right?

287
00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:09.390
P8: Yeah, I understand, yeah, it's clear.

288
00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:12.450
Moderator: Okay. Same as before…

289
00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:23.010
P8: Oh, go ahead. So, 4. Complete the VAFSC vendor file form. Is the vendor file form the bank? Your bank?

290
00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:30.580
Moderator: That's a good question. Would you want it to state some additional detail there to make that clearer?

291
00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:39.119
P8: Well, yeah, I mean, you know, most people don't think banks are vendors. They think banks are banks, you know?

292
00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:49.580
P8: Complete from the FSC vendor file form. I'm assuming it's going to be asking for, bank… your bank information, like the name of your bank.

293
00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:54.460
P8: Routing numbers, you know, all that sort of thing.

294
00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:55.830
Moderator: Gotcha.

295
00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:00.350
P8: You know, vendor file form, yeah.

296
00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:04.629
P8: If it's a bank that they're talking about, call it a bank.

297
00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:06.030
Moderator: Okay.

298
00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:18.969
Moderator: I gotcha. So on that 1 to 5 scale, again, 1 being very difficult, 5 being very easy, what would you rate the instructions that you see on this page?

299
00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:24.270
P8: Before or after my critique.

300
00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:29.500
Moderator: You can give me a rating for both. 3. A 3, okay.

301
00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:34.469
Moderator: And what would take it from that 3 to a 5? Meaning, very easy.

302
00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:37.440
P8: my comments.

303
00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:38.430
Moderator: Okay.

304
00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.339
Moderator: Alright, thank you. I am going to click.

305
00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:46.280
P8: Especially, number one, Oh.

306
00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:48.860
Moderator: Making this clearer?

307
00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:53.749
P8: Yes, it… determine if you have a direct deposit account.

308
00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:57.010
P8: Do this. You don't do this.

309
00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:57.970
Moderator: Okay.

310
00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:04.419
Moderator: Is there anything you want to call out on this page that's particularly helpful or confusing that you haven't already mentioned?

311
00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:06.000
P8: No.

312
00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:06.950
Moderator: Okay.

313
00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:11.289
Moderator: I'm gonna click that link and go to the next page in our prototype.

314
00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:30.000
Moderator: So you mentioned earlier on in the session that you received disability compensation via direct deposit. Now that you've seen, how to set up direct deposit for FMP, and based on what you know about setting up your own disability compensation direct deposit, do you think that the process is the same or different?

315
00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:41.500
P8: I mean, you're asking me to, well, I probably think it's different, because I can't remember if I had to hand jam my… my,

316
00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:44.200
P8: VA forms back then.

317
00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:46.470
P8: I don't think it was all online yet.

318
00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:51.159
P8: So I think I was able to do some things online.

319
00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:56.690
P8: through a VA portal, but I think I still had to do, paper and pen copies.

320
00:24:57.090 --> 00:24:58.540
Moderator: Mmm, okay.

321
00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:05.219
Moderator: So you think this one is different, it's a digital process. Anything else that would make them different?

322
00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:08.100
P8: No, I think digital process is better.

323
00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:12.500
Moderator: Alright, gotcha. Gonna click continue to next task.

324
00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:19.620
Moderator: So, at this point in the session, I'm gonna have you imagine that you're filling out your first FMP claim,

325
00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:38.310
Moderator: And I'm also going to imagine that you've already completed a number of sections of the form. So you've input your name, your social security, mailing and home address, as well as your phone and email. So I'm going to drop you into the middle of the form. Like I said, this prototype is not fully clickable, so some things we're not going to be able to, like, type in any fields.

326
00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:45.100
Moderator: But I'm gonna have you take a look at a couple of screens in the form, and we're gonna talk through them, if that's alright with you.

327
00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:53.790
Moderator: Alright, so just take a look at the content on this screen here, and I'm gonna ask you a couple of questions again.

328
00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:26.929
P8: All right, yeah, I get that first part. Basically, it's a foreign provider, though, right?

329
00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:31.590
Moderator: Yes, this would be a foreign provider that we're referring to here.

330
00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:38.489
P8: And they have all kinds of crazy addresses, right, to send checks to?

331
00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:43.039
Moderator: They might. I honestly haven't looked into it.

332
00:26:43.390 --> 00:26:45.440
P8: Yeah. They do.

333
00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:47.880
P8: Okay.

334
00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:55.370
Moderator: So, is there anything unclear about what this section is asking you to do, what you're seeing on the screen?

335
00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:01.839
P8: That's pretty clear.

336
00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:07.720
Moderator: All right. I'm gonna imagine that you've already paid the provider that you saw overseas. I'm gonna click Veteran.

337
00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:15.239
Moderator: And I'm gonna click the continue button now. So just take a look again at this page, and I'll ask you another couple of questions.

338
00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:45.009
P8: Are they still doing COVID-19, vaccines?

339
00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:46.320
P8: Overseas.

340
00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:48.569
Moderator: I believe so, yeah.

341
00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:52.019
P8: Oh, no one's doing them here.

342
00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:54.100
Moderator: Hmm.

343
00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:56.469
P8: Alright. No, I understand. Okay.

344
00:27:56.470 --> 00:28:04.090
Moderator: Okay, before I ask you some questions about this page, could you quickly explain your understanding of the content you saw on the previous page?

345
00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:06.639
Moderator: The one right before this?

346
00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:08.979
P8: Yeah, you want to differentiate if… if…

347
00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:12.459
P8: If you've already paid the provider.

348
00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:19.149
P8: then you want to be reimbursed. I don't think it, said reimbursed anywhere on that form.

349
00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:20.630
Moderator: Okay.

350
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:27.579
P8: who says, do you want to get paid, or do they want to get paid? I think that's the way I read… I read that stuff.

351
00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:28.280
P8: By the way.

352
00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:28.810
Moderator: Okay.

353
00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:31.399
P8: But if you paid the provider.

354
00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:34.129
P8: Then you want to be reimbursed.

355
00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:36.809
P8: So you'd want to check Veteran.

356
00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:41.309
Moderator: Okay. Is that true? Versus… yeah, yeah.

357
00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:53.940
Moderator: Got it. Okay. Is there anything on this page that stands out as confusing, or… or anything, unclear before we move on?

358
00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:57.550
P8: It's all… it's clear.

359
00:28:57.860 --> 00:29:11.340
Moderator: Okay, no additional document explanation needed? All right. I'm gonna click choose from folder, and through the magic of this prototype, you have uploaded an EOB, so I'm gonna click the continue button.

360
00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:22.370
Moderator: So, at this point, we're on the review page just before you submit. Let me know if you'd like me to expand any of these sections to take a look at them, or what you would do at this point.

361
00:29:26.550 --> 00:29:28.259
P8: Yeah, identification information.

362
00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:29.560
Moderator: Alright.

363
00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:33.600
P8: Okay.

364
00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:35.780
P8: Enclosure.

365
00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:41.589
P8: contact information?

366
00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:46.920
P8: Okay.

367
00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:49.789
P8: Payment selection?

368
00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:55.970
P8: Alright. Yeah, that's good.

369
00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:59.810
Moderator: Okay, anything else you want to look at, or any other comments?

370
00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:06.440
P8: No, I like this functionality. I've seen it in some of the other VA stuff.

371
00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:26.950
Moderator: I gotcha. Okay. I'm gonna imagine that you've signed the statement of truth. We're gonna click the submit button. Okay. So this is the page where you've submitted your FMP claim online. Can you take a minute to explain to me your understanding of what happens next and any action you might need to take? And feel free to let me know if you want me to scroll up or down this page.

372
00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:35.260
P8: Well, I'd print this page, I mean, hopefully the, Print function works properly.

373
00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:37.370
P8: Okay, then scroll down.

374
00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:16.580
P8: You can scroll down a little bit more.

375
00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:17.970
Moderator: Alright.

376
00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:26.939
P8: Alright, I understand it.

377
00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:39.420
Moderator: Okay, so, I was just curious, you mentioned you're hoping that the print function works. Have you ever submitted any forms on VA.gov where clicking the print this page function just didn't work?

378
00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:42.940
P8: sometimes not.

379
00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:44.170
Moderator: Okay.

380
00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:44.700
P8: And I, and…

381
00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:45.530
Moderator: Interesting.

382
00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:47.899
P8: Yeah, I mean, I use an Apple.

383
00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:54.800
P8: So, you know, I think they, they have… They, they recommend,

384
00:31:57.540 --> 00:32:02.140
P8: you know, Google browser, or Microsoft browser, or something.

385
00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:11.589
Moderator: Okay, gotcha. Have you ever gotten an error message when you tried to print it and it didn't work, or does it just sort of phase out, time out?

386
00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:15.999
P8: Yeah, I can't remember. I mean, I think generally many of the pages are working now.

387
00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:18.870
Moderator: Okay, cool. I was just curious, so…

388
00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:20.670
P8: Safari.

389
00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:23.120
Moderator: Actually, yes, you know what? DFAS.

390
00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:31.459
P8: Yeah, DFAS. I have to use a Chrome browser to be able to print up my… Retirement LES.

391
00:32:32.570 --> 00:32:33.480
Moderator: Oh, gotcha.

392
00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:38.590
P8: proper format. It doesn't print up properly with the Safari browser.

393
00:32:39.090 --> 00:32:54.270
Moderator: Gotcha, gotcha. So based on this page, I'd like to know your confidence, 1 being very low, 5 being very high, that you know that direct deposit was set up correctly based on what you saw in this prototype, and on this page here.

394
00:32:54.570 --> 00:32:55.619
P8: On this page?

395
00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:57.950
Moderator: Yeah, and in the whole prototype.

396
00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:07.110
P8: Yeah, as long as… as long as I input the direct deposit information in properly.

397
00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:16.179
Moderator: Okay, so if you could put a numeric value to that, with 1 being very low or 5 being very high, very confident, what number would you give it?

398
00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:24.429
P8: Well, how do you… how do you check that, well, it's the proper account. I would say 5.

399
00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:25.490
Moderator: Okay.

400
00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:28.709
P8: And I have no problem setting up direct deposit, accounts.

401
00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:36.089
Moderator: Is there anything about the direct deposit process that you saw in this prototype that would make you not want to file your claim online?

402
00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:38.420
P8: No.

403
00:33:39.010 --> 00:33:40.900
Moderator: Why wouldn't you?

404
00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:49.199
Moderator: Well, if there were any reasons, I'd love to know it, but it sounds like you didn't have any issues with it, so…

405
00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:50.320
P8: Okay. No.

406
00:33:50.370 --> 00:33:51.340
Moderator: So…

407
00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:53.549
P8: At least it's the tracking process, right?

408
00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:57.270
P8: If you do a paper copy, there's no tracking process. You get lost.

409
00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.629
P8: Doesn't get processed?

410
00:34:01.090 --> 00:34:05.939
Moderator: So you'd be… you would expect to be able to track this claim once you filed it? Yes.

411
00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:07.050
Moderator: Okay.

412
00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:11.050
Moderator: And where on VA.gov would you expect to track that claim?

413
00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:15.279
P8: on the, FMP, website.

414
00:34:15.570 --> 00:34:16.120
Moderator: Okay.

415
00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:22.560
P8: or claim portal, you know, check your claim, just like in the VA.gov site for other claims.

416
00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:30.410
Moderator: Alright, cool. So those were all my questions about those prototypes. I'm gonna stop sharing. I have a few more questions for you before we wrap up.

417
00:34:32.429 --> 00:34:41.249
Moderator: Alright, so what is your understanding of the direct deposit process for F&P claims, now that you've gone through the prototype?

418
00:34:42.010 --> 00:34:52.590
P8: I'm still not sure if… it would automatically recognize my current VA direct deposit.

419
00:34:52.719 --> 00:34:53.969
P8: situation.

420
00:34:54.440 --> 00:35:00.040
P8: Okay. Or I'd have to go in and set up a whole new direct deposit.

421
00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:04.090
P8: application for the FMP program.

422
00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:13.770
Moderator: So you're kind of answering my next question, which is what would be one thing to make it better for you than the current direct deposit process? It sounds like having a bit more

423
00:35:13.930 --> 00:35:19.780
Moderator: reassurance, whether it's recognizing your existing direct deposit for disability benefits payments.

424
00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:24.110
P8: And now that I think about it, one of the questions you can put on there is.

425
00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:38.200
P8: or one of the instructions you can put on there, if you already have a direct deposit account set up for VA disability claims, you still have to set up a direct deposit

426
00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:42.429
P8: account or application for the FMP program.

427
00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:46.140
Moderator: Yes, just so that folks aren't just zooming past it.

428
00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:48.370
P8: It's a different… it's a different program.

429
00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:52.990
P8: So the program needs to know your direct deposit information.

430
00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:54.240
P8: Yeah.

431
00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:54.740
Moderator: Yeah.

432
00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:57.559
P8: So you have direct deposit from the VA.

433
00:35:57.690 --> 00:36:02.059
P8: The FMP program requires its own direct deposit submission.

434
00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:07.000
Moderator: Okay. On that… Because I'd use the same account.

435
00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:08.450
Moderator: Yeah, yeah.

436
00:36:08.450 --> 00:36:12.129
P8: But I know I'd have to go in and actually set up the…

437
00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:17.340
P8: set it up under the FMP program. And I can't remember if I did it on this or not.

438
00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:18.530
Moderator: Okay.

439
00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:20.150
P8: I applied, I can't remember.

440
00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:36.820
Moderator: Gotcha, gotcha. So on that page where you saw the instructions for direct deposit, it mentioned that you could also call a VA number to help with setting up direct deposit for FMP. What are your thoughts about contacting VA via phone, and that extra step?

441
00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:41.660
P8: Well, I don't mind contacting the VA by phone, but if I don't have to.

442
00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:47.540
P8: I would… I would rather fill out it on… on… the computer.

443
00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:55.449
Moderator: Gotcha. And, what would make you confident that your reimbursement would actually get to your bank account once you file a claim?

444
00:36:57.470 --> 00:36:58.780
P8: It always gets there.

445
00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:06.000
P8: Once they have the electrons and the proper account numbers, you know…

446
00:37:06.610 --> 00:37:15.419
P8: electronic ACH transfers work. I… I have no, problems with ACH transfers.

447
00:37:15.730 --> 00:37:20.419
Moderator: Gotcha, so no problems you've experienced at all with VA and direct deposit?

448
00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:21.840
Moderator: Okay.

449
00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:23.970
P8: Nope.

450
00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:26.470
Moderator: Okay. Do you have any…

451
00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:27.900
P8: Five. Six.

452
00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:36.260
Moderator: Very, very, very confident. Do you have any additional feedback about the content that we went over today?

453
00:37:39.650 --> 00:37:44.430
P8: Just the specificity that I had mentioned in my comments.

454
00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:56.389
P8: that's about it, but as far as the page layouts and the order that everything is, that's all fine. I'm just, I'm trying to think, you know, when you, you know, you guys are…

455
00:37:56.420 --> 00:38:11.740
P8: are accustomed to all of the acronyms and the service centers. You know, we're not on the outside, so I think when you just look at those titles, just be very, very specific, and understand that we're looking at this stuff for the first time.

456
00:38:11.850 --> 00:38:19.799
P8: So, if it's not, you know, a complete description, or an accurate description.

457
00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:24.969
P8: Sometimes you have trouble. And it goes back to that thing, like, the vendor list.

458
00:38:25.290 --> 00:38:28.069
P8: You know, is it a vendor list, or is it a bank list?

459
00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:36.810
Moderator: Gotcha. That's a… that's a very good point to make. I still get some of my acronyms wrong, despite being around them all of the time.

460
00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:39.960
Moderator: Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?

461
00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:41.220
P8: No, no.

462
00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:49.010
Moderator: All right, and I wanted to circle back and just reconfirm that you're comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?

463
00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:49.800
P8: Cool.

464
00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:54.589
Moderator: Alright, is there any part of our discussion today that you would not want shared in a video clip?

465
00:38:54.910 --> 00:39:00.060
P8: None. But I have a question. My wife asked me. So, I'm signed up for this.

466
00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:08.020
P8: Right? But what about… what about my, my wife? What if my wife is traveling with me overseas, and she goes,

467
00:39:08.170 --> 00:39:09.450
P8: to a hospital.

468
00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:11.669
Moderator: Oh, interesting.

469
00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:12.800
P8: I don't…

470
00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:15.800
Moderator: I don't know that, FMP covers…

471
00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:16.210
P8: I care.

472
00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:20.539
Moderator: spouses, I think, yeah, she'd have to do it through TRICARE.

473
00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:21.240
P8: Okay.

474
00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:28.100
Moderator: But, yeah, that's a good question, and probably something that we should address on the claims form, so that folks know that, to be sure.

475
00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:36.209
P8: Yeah, you know, I think so, because I asked specifically when I… when I applied for this, and I think I recall it's just for the veteran.

476
00:39:36.350 --> 00:39:39.120
P8: Not dependents or anything like that.

477
00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:41.330
Moderator: Yeah, yeah.

478
00:39:42.810 --> 00:39:55.600
Moderator: Well, I just wanted to say that we really appreciate you taking time out of your day and out of your week to share your thoughts with us. This is super helpful for us as we continue to work on the site to make sure it really works for veterans, so thank you.

479
00:39:55.600 --> 00:40:05.199
Moderator: Lastly, Perigian will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

480
00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:10.149
Moderator: But with that, thank you so much again. Have a really great rest of your day and rest of your week.

481
00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:12.130
P8: Okay, my pleasure.

482
00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:13.639
Moderator: Alright, take care.

483
00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:15.189
P8: It was a pleasure. Alright, thanks.

484
00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:16.310
Moderator: Bye.
