00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:10.490
Renata: Alright, I have started the recording. I'd just like to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

2
00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:11.500
P6: Yes,

3
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:20.999
Renata: And are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?

4
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.250
P6: I am, yep,

5
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:30.789
Renata: Okay, so before we look at that prototype I mentioned before, just a few warm-up questions. Do you have a service-connected disability at VA?

6
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:31.670
P6: I do.

7
00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:35.629
Renata: All right, and do you mind sharing what your disability rating is?

8
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.040
P6: It's 100%.

9
00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.680
Renata: Okay, and do you receive direct deposit for your monthly compensation payments?

10
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:43.470
P6: I do.

11
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.760
Renata: Okay, thank you for sharing. Have you ever heard of the Foreign Medical Program through the VA before?

12
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.989
P6: Vaguely, yes. A little bit.

13
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:59.350
Renata: Okay, in your own words, what… what does the foreign medical program mean to you?

14
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:17.729
P6: So, I would think that if you're overseas somewhere, if you're close to a VA base, or, even calling the VA to make sure that you're covered by any, let's say, like, you know, the ER or any kind of urgent care, that you're able to use the, the VA or any kind of benefits that you have.

15
00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.340
Renata: Got it, thank you. Have you ever filed a reimbursement claim before, by chance?

16
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.329
P6: Just for travel.

17
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.800
Renata: Okay, gotcha. And are you on a mobile tablet or desktop computer today?

18
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.070
P6: A laptop.

19
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:50.059
Renata: Okay, great. So I'm gonna drop a link in the chat in just a moment, and I'd like you to open it up, and once you have it open, if you would please share your screen, feel free to close anything out at this point that you have…

20
00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:56.709
Renata: Open, that you don't want us to see, silence any notifications, that sort of thing.

21
00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.639
Renata: Just grabbing those prototype links.

22
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.560
Renata: Alright…

23
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:15.400
Renata: I've dropped it in the chat, and let me know if you need any assistance with getting, your screen shared. I know it can be a bit of a pain.

24
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.450
P6: Okay, it is open.

25
00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.459
Renata: Alright, and are you able to share your screen now that you've got it loaded?

26
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.500
P6: Sure, yeah. Looking at how to do that… let's see…

27
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.759
Renata: there should be a big green button in Zoom. Oh, sure.

28
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:09.660
P6: Got it, okay, share, and… I think this one, right? Share… Allowed…

29
00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:23.679
Renata: It's loading, it's loading, I see it, okay, perfect. So, just like you to take a look at this page, and just review the information on it, and please remember to think out loud. Once you're done reviewing it, I'll have some questions for you.

30
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.990
P6: Okay, let's see… okay.

31
00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:04.660
P6: Okay, I have read it.

32
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:16.609
Renata: Okay, so based on this page, without clicking anywhere, but just based on what you see here on the screen, what would you do next if you were filing your first FMP claim today?

33
00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:34.700
P6: I would definitely check out, the supporting documents that you need, and then, for direct deposit as well. But then, so with that, is there a way to figure out, is it anywhere you go that will allow you to have care, or…

34
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.730
P6: Can you look and see, like, okay, well, this, you know, office, or this,

35
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:47.550
P6: Sorry, my bad. What's it called? The daggone hospital. Like, what if there's certain places that will not allow VA coverage?

36
00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.009
P6: Like, how do you know which ones?

37
00:04:50.770 --> 00:05:00.310
Renata: gonna be a little annoying and answer your question with another question. Is that something that you would expect or want to see on this page before filing an FMP claim?

38
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:01.889
P6: Yes. Okay.

39
00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:10.480
Renata: So some kind of outline or explanation of, like, provider types, something of that nature.

40
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:26.849
P6: Right, yeah, because I mean… so, I mean, I guess a lot of us would assume that we're covered, but what if a hospital comes back and they're like, oh, we don't take that kind of insurance? And then you're like, oh, shoot, you know? Now I'm stuck here with the bill. Yeah.

41
00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:33.130
Renata: Yeah, I gotcha. I gotcha. Any other feedback on this first page before we move forward?

42
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.559
P6: Nope, just, just that, yeah.

43
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:45.209
Renata: Okay, you can go ahead and scroll down and click on that link that says Get Started with the green arrow. If you scroll up a little bit, yeah, it's right there underneath the blue box.

44
00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:46.150
P6: Oh.

45
00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:53.579
P6: Nope. Get started… Did I miss it? Oh, here we go. Alright.

46
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:55.639
Renata: Yeah, there we go.

47
00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:08.859
Renata: Alright, so I'm gonna pause you here for a moment. I'm gonna ask you just to state in your own words what the information and that, blue alert box on the previous page meant.

48
00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:14.289
P6: Can I go back?

49
00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:17.740
Renata: Unfortunately, I'm gonna keep you here, but we're not testing knowledge or ability.

50
00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:18.220
P6: Interesting.

51
00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.180
Renata: I'm curious what you remember.

52
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:30.940
P6: No, I just saw that, it just, you know, lets you know that you can, submit, documents, and then it also had mentioned,

53
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:41.250
P6: What else? Bah! Brain fog right now. Submitting documents, and then…

54
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.710
P6: Just mentioning how the program works.

55
00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:56.389
Renata: Okay, gotcha. On a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being very difficult and 5 being very easy, how would you rate the clarity of the information on that first page that you saw?

56
00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:59.719
P6: I'd say about a 5, yeah. Pretty straightforward.

57
00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:05.749
Renata: Anything in particular that made it, like, particularly straightforward to understand?

58
00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:17.219
P6: I definitely like to, like, the buttons that you can click and just, you know, bring down information, and then the fact that it's, like, a different color, too, so it's not, like, kind of blended with the other information on the page.

59
00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:21.969
Renata: Got it, okay. Thank you. You can go ahead and click continue to next task.

60
00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:22.850
P6: Okay.

61
00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:35.490
Renata: Now, just take a minute to look over this page on direct deposit for the foreign medical program. Remember to think out loud while you're reviewing it, and once you're done, I'll have some questions for you.

62
00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.770
P6: Okay,

63
00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:24.380
P6: Okay.

64
00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:31.719
Renata: All right. What are your impressions of this page and your understanding of the content here?

65
00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:41.429
P6: I like it, yeah, I feel like it's pretty straightforward. I like that you have the, like, the blue button just, like, right below the information.

66
00:08:41.859 --> 00:08:51.029
P6: So it's pretty, you know, it pops out. And then same thing with, it's, like, very, like, 1, 2, 3, like, steps. That's how I learn anyway.

67
00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:51.560
Renata: Okay.

68
00:08:51.890 --> 00:09:01.659
P6: Yeah, so I feel like it's just pretty easy, and then I like how you have the phone number right there, because sometimes, like, you have to look all the way at the bottom to contact, you know, someone.

69
00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:12.830
P6: So that's pretty good, too. And then I like this, too, with the, you'll need this information right here. You've got it right there. Like, all of it in one… one area.

70
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:15.170
P6: So it's good to…

71
00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:20.799
P6: And then ID me, a lot of us know about that, so… that's good, too.

72
00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:25.330
P6: But yeah, no, I do like this page, I do.

73
00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:28.959
P6: I feel like it's very tight, and just, you know, here we go.

74
00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:37.560
Renata: Anything confusing, or, particularly helpful that you want to call out on this page?

75
00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:49.310
P6: I would say definitely, like, just having that number at the very front, in the very beginning of the page. I do like that. Instead of having to scroll and try to figure out how to contact.

76
00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:51.720
P6: A company, I do like that.

77
00:09:52.430 --> 00:10:01.180
P6: So that's only one. And again, like, right here with this, you'll need this information. I like that this is just, like, everything right there in one.

78
00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:08.669
P6: I do like that, too. And again, that's not at the bottom, either. It's, like, very, you know, right in the beginning of you looking for information.

79
00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:18.960
Renata: Alright, alright. Could you state in your own words, please, the process and in what order you would need to set up direct deposit for your FMP claims?

80
00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:26.170
P6: So it seems like, again, you'd have to go to this website, and then,

81
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:45.379
P6: again, like, if you have any, you know, or you need help, anything, or to call that number. But yeah, it seems like just go to this, you know, this page, and then putting in this information, and again, you know, you have the number right here, so… it seems pretty straightforward to me. Yeah.

82
00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:46.590
Renata: Okay.

83
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:56.749
Renata: Got it. Same as before, that 1 to 5 scale, with 1 being very difficult and 5 being very easy, what would you rate the instructions on this page?

84
00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:58.330
P6: I'd say a 5.

85
00:10:58.710 --> 00:10:59.380
Renata: Okay.

86
00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:00.340
P6: Got it.

87
00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:06.290
Renata: You can go ahead and scroll down to the bottom… I think if you click…

88
00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:10.600
Renata: I think it's if you click the Foreign Medical Programs link there at the bottom.

89
00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:14.389
Renata: It'll take you to the next page. Yeah, that one.

90
00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:15.120
P6: Okay.

91
00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:20.290
Renata: Alright, we're just gonna pause here on this page for a minute.

92
00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:38.709
Renata: So, you mentioned previously that you receive disability compensation via direct deposit. Now that you've seen how to set up direct deposit for FMP and what you know about your own VA disability compensation setup, do you think that the process would be the same or different?

93
00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:41.610
P6: I would say the same.

94
00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:42.500
Renata: Okay.

95
00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:49.189
Renata: Got it. Can you explain your thinking? Why, why, like, based on what you've seen, why you think they're the same?

96
00:11:49.190 --> 00:12:13.089
P6: So when you do your VA, disability claim, so it's also kind of similar to what you guys have, too. So, like, within the, like, when you first submit it, it'll tell you, like, call this number, or, you know, set up a deposit, because I know some people, they want to have, like, their mail, you know, check or whatever, but, I think it's, like, the first paragraph or the second paragraph where it says, you know, enter, like, click here.

97
00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:19.210
P6: Put in your information, like, for your checking, or your savings account. So pretty similar.

98
00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:20.320
P6: Pretty similar.

99
00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:25.889
Renata: Okay, gotcha. Do you think you would need to do anything different for FMP claims?

100
00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:36.940
P6: Oh, no, I mean, well, I guess… no, I wouldn't say that, no. Because you have to submit paperwork as well for VA.

101
00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:39.709
P6: You know, in general for your claims, so…

102
00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:43.649
Renata: I mean, I think maybe y'all would have a little bit more paperwork?

103
00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:48.730
P6: But… to submit… But roughly the same, the same thing.

104
00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:49.920
Renata: Okay.

105
00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:55.729
Renata: I'm gonna have you go ahead and click that continue to next task, that blue sort of arrow link there, yeah.

106
00:12:56.930 --> 00:13:15.489
Renata: All right, so, at this point, we're gonna imagine that you are filling out that claims form. We're gonna… once you click that continue to next task, we're going to imagine that you're about midway through the form. You've already filled out your basic information about who you are and your contact info.

107
00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:24.220
Renata: Gonna have you look at the rest of the form. Like I said, this is a prototype, so we're not actually gonna be able to, like, click and fill stuff out. We're gonna have to do a little bit of…

108
00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:29.850
Renata: imagination there, but I'm gonna have you look at a few more screens, so go ahead and click continue to next task.

109
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:37.270
Renata: And if you could just think out loud and just look at this page for me, and then I'll have some questions for you.

110
00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:38.440
P6: Okay.

111
00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:42.669
P6: Let's see…

112
00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:48.910
P6: Veteran…

113
00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.929
P6: Let's see… okay.

114
00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:17.720
P6: Okay, I mean, I would, suggest maybe, because there are some people that are under care of others, so if you could maybe put, like, if they have, if they do have a caregiver.

115
00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:20.090
P6: Maybe put that as an option.

116
00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:29.169
Renata: Oh, I see. So, like, if a spouse or caregiver paid for the care, the option to send the payment to them instead?

117
00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:30.190
P6: Yes,

118
00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:33.800
Renata: Okay, interesting. Thank you for that feedback.

119
00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:34.530
P6: Of course.

120
00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:40.010
Renata: So, in your own words, what is this… what are the instructions on this page asking you to do?

121
00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:44.410
P6: So it looks for, like, for payment,

122
00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:48.570
P6: Let's see, if I'm paid the provider, select provider…

123
00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:53.680
P6: Alright, let me go back… Okay.

124
00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:57.999
P6: If you… I'll repeat the fighter…

125
00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:11.300
P6: Hmm, okay. So, with this care, if you're asking about paying the veteran, are you talking about, like, mileage claim, or if the veteran paid out of pocket?

126
00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:13.929
P6: I'm kind of confused with that… that part.

127
00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:28.210
Renata: Mmm, okay. Again, I'm gonna be annoying. I'm gonna answer your question with a question. What would help you understand, like, what's covered, or sort of what… what claim, what's allowed here in terms of payments?

128
00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:36.499
P6: I would say maybe on the back, or the, maybe, like, one of the first pages, to put something there that says, like, hey, you know,

129
00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:47.530
P6: Because, I mean, I think a lot of people would assume that if you're being seen outside, and you're using, you know, well, actually, you know what? I take that back. So, what exactly…

130
00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:52.930
P6: constitutes you being able to use the VA to go be seen.

131
00:15:55.590 --> 00:16:13.740
P6: So, I would, I think there should be something that says, like, you know, point blank of, like, okay, well, let's just say you have, you know, an emergency, or, like, you know, you call the ambulance, or… I'm just thinking of, like, random things, but you just don't want to be stuck with a bill, because, God forbid, you know, you thought you were covered.

132
00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:15.320
P6: And you weren't?

133
00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:17.659
P6: So, if there could be, like, a clear-cut

134
00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:29.470
P6: list of, you know, or even a phone number to call, like, hey, before you go, which I know that can't happen a lot, but if you can call someone and be like, hey, am I covered before I get seen? You know.

135
00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:44.650
Renata: Yeah, yeah, I get that. Now, I'm curious, would you want to see that sort of explanation of covered care on the first page that you saw? Would you want to see it on this page? Would you want to see it on both? I would say… What do you think would be best?

136
00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:54.130
P6: I would say both, but definitely, like, in the beginning. Like, you know, looking up, like, for a medical program, I would hope that'd be, like, one of the first things that you see.

137
00:16:55.160 --> 00:17:01.299
Renata: Okay, gotcha. You can go ahead and, click the radio button that says Veteran.

138
00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:12.180
Renata: we're gonna imagine that you had a medical expense, and you can go ahead and click continue. Again, this… our prototype is a little bit,

139
00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:21.470
Renata: Doesn't quite work the way VA.gov does. If you could just take a look at this page and review it again, got a couple more questions for you, once you're done.

140
00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:23.990
P6: Let's see…

141
00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:29.160
P6: Okay.

142
00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:55.030
P6: Okay.

143
00:17:55.780 --> 00:18:03.929
Renata: Alright, first question for you, could you explain in your own words the content that you saw on the previous page?

144
00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:15.660
P6: So that one was with, like, billing, or not billing, sorry, of, where you went for care and whatnot, and, submitting information.

145
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:17.980
Renata: Okay.

146
00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:26.239
Renata: And is there anything on the current page that you're on that you want to call out that's unclear, or where you'd like additional explanation?

147
00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:29.180
P6: Let's see…

148
00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:38.080
P6: So, is there a way that you can, inform the person once they submit their request that, you know, if you'll get an email or a text message?

149
00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:40.529
P6: Just to verify that they received it.

150
00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:44.519
Renata: That the… that the foreign medical program received the claim.

151
00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:45.170
P6: Huh.

152
00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:46.440
Renata: Okay.

153
00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:48.579
Renata: That, that would be your feedback here?

154
00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:52.639
Renata: Okay, gotcha, gotcha. Anything else that you want to call out?

155
00:18:57.550 --> 00:18:59.400
P6: No, no. -

156
00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:07.799
Renata: Alright, you can go ahead and click where it says Choose from Folder for Upload File, in that little… yeah, in that box.

157
00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:12.930
Renata: And it is, magically… Going to attach a file for you.

158
00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:17.000
Renata: You can go ahead and click continue at the bottom of the page.

159
00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:29.350
Renata: Alright, so at this point, you've filled out your claims form. I'd just like you to review the information on this page, and then we're gonna look at some more stuff.

160
00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:31.110
P6: Okay.

161
00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:45.760
P6: Okay.

162
00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:54.190
Renata: And typically, when you've filled out VA forms in the past, do you open and review all of the sections of the form on this page, or do you just…

163
00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:58.189
Renata: Do you just sign and submit? What do you typically do?

164
00:19:58.190 --> 00:19:59.989
P6: I review. Okay.

165
00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:09.719
Renata: Gotcha. Alright, you can go ahead and we'll imagine that you've reviewed and signed, and you can go ahead and click the submit button, that blue button there.

166
00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:23.730
Renata: So, now this is the page where you have submitted your FMP claim online. Can you explain to me your understanding of what happens next, and any action that you might need to take at this point?

167
00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:32.909
P6: So I would hope that you get, a confirmation email, or a text message, or a phone call to let you know that, they've got your claim.

168
00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:41.389
P6: And hopefully, like, within, I would just say, like, a month or two, just giving you an update, like, hey, we've got your claim, we're still working on it, kind of thing.

169
00:20:43.370 --> 00:21:03.539
P6: Yeah, and then maybe, like, a link, too, like, if you… I mean, I know you can't edit it after you submit it, like, you know, right away, but if you could later, like, let's just say, like, you ended up getting a, you know, a caregiver, or you got married, or something happened, I'm not sure, but if there's some kind of link for you to go in and edit what you, put in for your claim.

170
00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:11.190
Renata: Oh, I see. So, like, maybe you forgot to add a receipt, or you want to change the payment.

171
00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:26.080
Renata: of a submitted claim. Okay, got it, got it, okay. Thank you for that. What is your confidence rating? 1 is very low, 5 is very high, that you have direct deposit correctly set up based on this prototype and the page here.

172
00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:28.629
P6: I'd say a 5, yeah.

173
00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:29.710
Renata: Okay.

174
00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:34.360
P6: Alright, anything in particular that made it a 5, being very, very confident?

175
00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:39.239
P6: I like that it was very, like, just word for, like, detailed.

176
00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:51.619
P6: That way, it was like, if you have any questions, call this, and it said what to do, like, what to submit to, as well, like, so you… that way you can be like, okay, I got my, you know, social security number in there, I've got this submitted, this submitted, XYZ.

177
00:21:51.900 --> 00:22:00.840
Renata: Yeah, yeah. Is there anything about the direct deposit process that you saw in this prototype that would make you not file your FMP claim online?

178
00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:01.930
P6: No?

179
00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:08.240
Renata: Okay, got it. So…

180
00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:18.389
Renata: What is your understanding on how the direct deposit process for FMP claims works now that you've gone all the way through the prototype?

181
00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:33.620
P6: Yeah, it looks pretty straightforward. Yeah, like I said, I would definitely want to know in the beginning of, like, what constitutes you being able to submit a claim. But that's it, yeah.

182
00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:40.290
Renata: Okay, so no, no issues with the direct deposit content, you just want additional content explaining what's covered care.

183
00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:50.689
Renata: Okay. What would be one thing that you would change about the current direct deposit process to make it better, as you understand it?

184
00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:59.609
P6: Nothing, honestly. It's… yeah, you just click a few buttons, and then they're like, okay, well, we have your claim, so…

185
00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:00.640
Renata: Okay.

186
00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:10.609
P6: And then, and then if you check your, your checking account or savings account, it's right there, too. So, it's been a lot easier than what it was in the past.

187
00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:13.070
Renata: Yeah, that's for sure.

188
00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:29.950
Renata: So, thinking back to that page with the steps on how to do direct deposit, you called out that you could call the FSC number. I'm curious, what are your thoughts about that extra step to contact the VA to get help with the setup process for direct deposit?

189
00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:33.859
P6: In a good way, bad way, or…

190
00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:37.530
Renata: Oh, anyway, I mean, you can tell me if it's good or bad. I'm curious.

191
00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:38.080
P6: Is that your thoughts?

192
00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:38.760
Renata: are.

193
00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:47.680
P6: Yeah, no, I think it's… well, hmm, let me… let me pause on that one. No, it's good when it works.

194
00:23:48.180 --> 00:24:00.709
P6: Okay. So sometimes you're on hold for a good hour, half an hour, sometimes you get disconnected. So maybe even, like, a chat button? I don't know, that's a lot to ask, but maybe even a chat button, or…

195
00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:03.039
P6: Even a callback feature, too.

196
00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:04.660
P6: would be good.

197
00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.650
P6: Okay. Yeah.

198
00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:20.710
Renata: Gotcha, gotcha. So anything about the direct deposit process, that felt confusing, complicated, or might… it might not cause you… might cause you not to file your claim online? Sorry, flubbed that question.

199
00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:30.859
P6: Oh, no, you're fine. None. Oh, but I meant to ask, too, is there… I know it's, like, secure message, I'm sure you probably get a lot of people, but if… even if you had that, too, like, a secure message…

200
00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:31.290
Renata: your message.

201
00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:33.810
P6: Okay. Yeah.

202
00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:36.719
Renata: Gotcha. Sorry, so that was it for that one.

203
00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:37.760
Renata: Oh, no, that's great.

204
00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:41.110
P6: Nothing confusing. Yeah, nothing confusing or anything, so…

205
00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:42.110
Renata: Okay.

206
00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:49.670
Renata: Last question about this, what would make you confident that your reimbursement would actually get to your bank account once you file?

207
00:24:50.080 --> 00:25:00.339
P6: Definitely submission information, for sure. And then I like that it says, print for your records, that way you can have the date and time that you submitted it.

208
00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:02.869
P6: But, yeah, so it's good.

209
00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:11.790
Renata: Okay, so just being able to save a copy of your submission, and I think you mentioned before, like, a link to update your claim if… if something changes?

210
00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:13.900
P6: Okay, gotcha.

211
00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:19.850
Renata: So we're actually done looking at the prototype. I have a few more questions before we wrap up, but you can stop sharing your screen.

212
00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:20.790
P6: Okay.

213
00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:29.609
Renata: Okay. Okay. Do you have any additional feedback about the content that we went over today?

214
00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:32.399
P6: No, no, it was great, thank you.

215
00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:34.710
Renata: Okay, any questions for me?

216
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:37.460
P6: No questions? Nope. -

217
00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:56.069
Renata: All right, and I wanted to circle back and reconfirm that you're comfortable if we were to share a video clip of the session with our VA partners, and just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing, and we only share the videos with internal VA partners for the purposes of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.

218
00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:57.439
P6: Okay, yeah, that's fine.

219
00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:02.539
Renata: Alright, is there anything that you would not want shared in a video clip from our discussion today?

220
00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:05.419
P6: Nope, nope. Do as you wish.

221
00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:10.110
Renata: All right. I'm gonna stop the recording really quickly.
