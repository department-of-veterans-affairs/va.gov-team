00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.339
P13: Well, the foreign program, I, I went, I went,

28
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.620

29
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.489
P13: For a little… for almost a month.

30
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:41.300
P13: With my… I met one of my sons, and we, we walked and took fast train, all over Europe.

31
00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:48.989
P13: And, so before I… before I, I went… before I registered with the Foreign Medical Program.

32
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:55.329
P13: us, you know, which was fairly easy to do, once I, you know,

33
00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:03.739
P13: And so, that way. But while I was there, I became… I did become very ill, but not where I needed to be admitted.

34
00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.800
P13: Or, I was… I got very ill when I was in Munich, Germany.

35
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.970
P13: For about, two and a half days.

36
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.440
P13: But I… I was just able to get medication.

37
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:23.239
P13: That's all. But if I had to be, admitted, then I knew the procedure to take care of.

38
00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.529
Moderator: I see, so you're registered, but in this case, you did not use…

39
00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:36.930
P13: Yeah, I was pretty aware of… I made sure that I understood the process before I, before I, I went.

40
00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.120

41
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.040

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:45.460
Moderator: We'll probably circle back to that in a bit, then. Okay, for this next portion, then, I'll… I'll kind of get, click on the Get Start link here.

164
00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:46.160
P13: Okay.

165
00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:57.679
Moderator: And then in, we'll pause here for another question. In your own word, what information was set, or what information was shown on the previous page?

166
00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:04.340
P13: The information was, how to upload, invoices.

167
00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:13.509
P13: That's what I remember. I gotcha. And then… Is that correct?

168
00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:17.929
Moderator: There's… there's some… there's some portions of it.

169
00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:18.670
P13: Okay.

170
00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:28.449
Moderator: On a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very difficult and 5 being very easy, what would you rate the clarity of the information on that page you just saw?

171
00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:33.909
P13: Oh, I, I, I, I, I would, 6 or 7.

172
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:39.050
Moderator: It's on a scale of 1 to 5, so… One being…

173
00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:40.659
P13: 5 to 5? Oh, a 4.

174
00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:44.549
Moderator: 4, and then can you elaborate on why a 4 out of 5?

175
00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:48.570
P13: Well, first of all, you know, I'm not a young vet.

176
00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:53.409
P13: I'm an older vet. I do know how to… to, you know.

177
00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:59.730
P13: negotiate through VA.gov. I'm on VA.gov at least once a day.

178
00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:01.540
P13: For something.

179
00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:02.790
P13: Yeah.

180
00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:07.189
P13: So, but because of my age, you know, I don't, I don't,

181
00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:09.950
P13: I'm not as proficient as you are.

182
00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:14.470
P13: You know, but, like I say, I'm a Vietnam vet.

183
00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:20.559
P13: I'm, I, yeah, I think that the VA.gov,

184
00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:24.069
P13: Site is pretty easy, if you know what you're doing.

185
00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:28.979
P13: You know, but I don't really have much problem with… with,

186
00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:36.220
P13: VA.gov, you know, going through all the… the procedures.

187
00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:40.689
Moderator: I gotcha. So, in general, it's pretty easy for you.

188
00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:42.510
P13: Yeah, but I'm on there a lot.

189
00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:43.740
Moderator: I gotcha.

190
00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:45.310
P13: Yeah, or something.

191
00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:47.820
P13: Like I said, usually every day.

192
00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:48.240
Moderator: Yeah.

193
00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:52.339
P13: I use secure messaging all the time.

194
00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:58.989
Moderator: I see, so you're very familiar with the VA system. Alright, let me click here to continue.

195
00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:11.969
Moderator: So here is the next page here, and again, same thing, I'm gonna slowly scroll down, and then I will ask you to kind of go through it, and then think out loud as you're going through this.

196
00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:14.640
P13: Okay.

197
00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:30.549
P13: I think if you go through the steps one by one as it's talking, it's… I think it would be pretty…

198
00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:33.430
P13: Pretty easy to… to… to do.

199
00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:35.130
Moderator: I got you.

200
00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:42.170
P13: I usually go step-by-step, you know, I don't always remember, but I'll go back, like.

201
00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:44.769
P13: Number 2, that's, that's fairly easy.

202
00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:55.720
P13: I already have an ID.me account.

203
00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:59.270
P13: A lot of vets don't, by the way.

204
00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:04.890
P13: I've helped, I've helped, several vets set up their ID.me account.

205
00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:11.800
P13: Because a lot of vets I'm with are over 65 to 70 years old.

206
00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.610
P13: Oh, okay.

207
00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:29.590
P13: I feel that's fairly, fairly expl… it explains a lot… a lot pretty… fairly easy to me.

208
00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:32.449
P13: That was just a matter of following the steps.

209
00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:35.600
P13: Is that what you want to hear?

210
00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.300
Moderator: Yeah, basically.

211
00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:43.330
Moderator: So, what is your impression on… of this page and your understanding of the content here?

212
00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:45.050
P13: Right here.

213
00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:48.720
Moderator: Just in this whole page in general, your impression of it.

214
00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:52.679
P13: I think it's fairly easy. I mean, if you follow step-by-step.

215
00:14:52.840 --> 00:15:01.790
P13: You know, like, like doing your tax, you know, your tax return for the end of every year. I think it's fairly easy. You just… you just follow

216
00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:03.500
P13: Step by step.

217
00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:13.180
Moderator: Okay, so that makes sense. And then, in order to kind of set up a direct deposit for F&P claim, how would you do it in your own words?

218
00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:20.690
P13: Like I say, I would just… I would just follow step by step.

219
00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:31.179
Moderator: Gotcha. And then the same as before, on the scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very difficult, and 5 being very easy, how would you rate the instruction?

220
00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:35.880
P13: I would give it a 4. The reason I wouldn't give it a 5 is because of my age.

221
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:36.920
P13: In a wash.

222
00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:38.290
P13: Yeah.

223
00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:44.610
P13: So, in general, it's pretty straightforward, but… It's pretty straightforward. Another thing I would say is that,

224
00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:49.740
P13: If I… if I have a pro… I've only been there maybe once or twice. Yeah.

225
00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:56.159
P13: At the VA, the local VA, they have an office there.

226
00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:59.480
P13: That, they help, they help, they'll help you.

227
00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:04.600
P13: If you have any questions about navigating through VA.gov.

228
00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.000
Moderator: Gotcha, so you're reaching…

229
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:12.600
P13: I've only been there once, only for… I don't remember the reason why, but yeah, they're pretty helpful.

230
00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:13.470
Moderator: Gotcha.

231
00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:16.279
P13: I think it's just a matter of doing this once.

232
00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:20.600
Moderator: I mean, it's… and you do step-by-step, but I think it's tough…

233
00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:23.510
P13: for these, but I would give it a 4, mainly because of my age.

234
00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:32.239
Moderator: Gotcha. And then, would you call anything on this page that was being either especially helpful or confusing to you?

235
00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:36.130
P13: Well…

236
00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:49.590
P13: What's… what is helpful, like, number 3, learn how to create an ID.me account. I talk to a lot of vets, and they don't have… they don't have an ID.me account, and they don't… they don't realize that you can…

237
00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:59.360
P13: like, you can go… it's easy to go on there, and I mess… like I say, I message back and forth to my… to my,

238
00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:01.659
P13: My clinics, quite often.

239
00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:02.990
Moderator: I gotcha.

240
00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:04.079
P13: It's easy.

241
00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:06.409
P13: It eliminates a lot of time.

242
00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:08.530
Moderator: I'd like the additional information.

243
00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:11.070
P13: Yeah, that's, that's, it's great.

244
00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:14.449
P13: A lot easier than it was a year… a couple years ago.

245
00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:16.209
Moderator: That's good to be fair.

246
00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:20.259
P13: Because of you, you, what you, you people are doing.

247
00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:21.589
Moderator: Thank you.

248
00:17:21.599 --> 00:17:22.219
P13: You know?

249
00:17:23.819 --> 00:17:26.679
Moderator: Alright, then I'll move on to the next portion here.

250
00:17:27.219 --> 00:17:32.459
Moderator: a pause here again. You mentioned that you received a disability compensation via.

251
00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:32.930
P13: Yes.

252
00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:34.220
Moderator: direct deposit.

253
00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:36.300
P13: Yes. Now that you've seen both…

254
00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:48.000
Moderator: how to set up direct deposit, and what you already know about the, kind of, disability compensation setup. What do you think the process is? Would it be the same or different?

255
00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:54.240
P13: I think it's fairly… fairly uniform.

256
00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:55.390
Moderator: Okay.

257
00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:57.790
P13: Yeah, I, I, I, I think, yeah.

258
00:17:58.140 --> 00:17:59.850
Moderator: And then, can you elaborate on that?

259
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000
P13: I, I, I think that,

260
00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:08.559
P13: I think he used about the same method.

261
00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:13.279
P13: So is it… so is that it's not confusing to vets?

262
00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:22.490
P13: It's… over a period of time, you know, the last 3-4 years, it's been easier and easier.

263
00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:23.750
Moderator: Gotcha.

264
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:27.769
P13: But you don't find a lot of vets like myself. I'm on VA.gov.

265
00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:31.290
Moderator: Like I say, at least every day.

266
00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:32.589
P13: for something.

267
00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:33.890
Moderator: Very fair.

268
00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:35.810
P13: But whether it's the claim…

269
00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:42.600
P13: reimbursement for mileage. I mean, I live about… it takes about 45 minutes to get to the local VA.

270
00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:43.320
Moderator: Right.

271
00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:46.039
P13: And I… I'm usually there about 3 times a week.

272
00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.000
Moderator: I gotcha.

273
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.639
P13: So I make… I make for sure that I'm reimbursed for my mileage.

274
00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:54.160
P13: You know?

275
00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:56.769
P13: Same as with my medications.

276
00:18:57.020 --> 00:19:02.029
P13: You know, and it's the same would be for reimbursement for any foreign travel.

277
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:09.479
Moderator: And then, do you think you would need anything different for this, foreign medical program claims?

278
00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:12.769
P13: No, I think, I think…

279
00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:17.010
P13: like I said, I think it's fairly uniform.

280
00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:19.369
P13: I, I,

281
00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:28.250
P13: My wife, my wife is on VA doc, you know, the VA, reimbursement for spouses.

282
00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:28.930
Moderator: Yeah.

283
00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:33.179
P13: And, you know, we double-check that all the time.

284
00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:34.390
Moderator: Okay.

285
00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:39.879
Moderator: That sounds great. Okay, so we'll move on to the next task here.

286
00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:42.080
Moderator: So I'm gonna…

287
00:19:42.250 --> 00:20:01.699
Moderator: Click to continue here. So, for here, we'll pretend like you went through a lot of the form already. You filled out your name, social security, you know, your mailing address and home address. Now you're towards the end of the, towards the end of the form here, and then, again, I'll ask you to kind of

288
00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:06.150
Moderator: Look at it, talk out loud as we're going through this.

289
00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:07.970
Moderator: Just wanna hear your thoughts.

290
00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:23.770
P13: I think that's fairly easy.

291
00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:30.440
P13: In fact, if I've paid a claim, like a pharmacy.

292
00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:32.850
P13: Which I did, you know, you just,

293
00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:36.729
P13: You just, uploads it to,

294
00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:41.030
P13: get reimbursement, or if I haven't, then they would just pay for that.

295
00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:41.970
Moderator: Gotcha.

296
00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:44.789
P13: Yeah, that's, I think that's pretty easy.

297
00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:45.760
Moderator: And then…

298
00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:46.580
P13: I feel.

299
00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:50.640
Moderator: For this page, what is the… what is it asking you to do?

300
00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:57.620
P13: It's asking me if, if I've already played, paid, the provider.

301
00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:01.840
P13: To, upload my,

302
00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:05.269
P13: the invoice so that, I can be reimbursed?

303
00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:13.560
P13: I haven't paid, to… I would upload, or whatever I need to do to be,

304
00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:16.789
P13: For them to pay the provider.

305
00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:18.230
Moderator: Gotcha. Anything…

306
00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:20.879
P13: It's an either-or situation.

307
00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:23.019
Moderator: Anything unclear here for you?

308
00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:23.600
P13: No.

309
00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:24.730
P13: I don't think so.

310
00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:25.710
Moderator: Alrighty.

311
00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:27.289
Moderator: Then let's say we'll go ahead.

312
00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:30.600
P13: Yeah, veteran. Veteran, then continue.

313
00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:35.570
Moderator: And then again, same thing, where you're going through this and posting out loud.

314
00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:40.429
P13: Yeah, so I'll upload the billing statement. That's… that's fairly…

315
00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:43.000
P13: You have to learn how to upload.

316
00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:52.239
P13: You know… you know, I use my scanner into my Mac, and then…

317
00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:57.070
P13: It goes into my… I upload into, my documents, and then…

318
00:21:57.530 --> 00:22:00.290
P13: That's how I upload into VA.gov.

319
00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:01.670
Moderator: Gotcha.

320
00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:07.199
P13: Yep, that's, that's fairly easy.

321
00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:11.540
P13: All kind of familiar to you?

322
00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:15.219
P13: Yeah, I'm pretty familiar with this.

323
00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:18.130
Moderator: Alright.

324
00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:21.740
P13: But not every… I know a lot of vets that can't do this.

325
00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:24.909
P13: You know, they've never done that.

326
00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:25.960
Moderator: Right.

327
00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:32.130
P13: But, the… you know, they also didn't,

328
00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:40.879
P13: go through the process of getting their… I know a lot of vets that should be rated for the disabilities that aren't, because they don't want to take the time to

329
00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:44.609
P13: To see your doctor, and… And go through that process.

330
00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:47.520
Moderator: It sounds like you helped them with the application.

331
00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:48.439
P13: Yeah, I have.

332
00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.699
Moderator: Oh, that's really sweet of you.

333
00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:52.160
P13: Okay.

334
00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:54.350
Moderator: So we'll move on here.

335
00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:55.160
P13: Okay.

336
00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:01.219
P13: Yeah, that's pretty.

337
00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:13.749
P13: That's, that's all, that's all fairly,

338
00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:17.899
P13: The process, you know, put in your name and…

339
00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:26.039
P13: So this is all very familiar to you. Yeah, yeah. I would say that, I would say this 4 to… 4 or 5.

340
00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:26.630
Moderator: Yeah.

341
00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:27.210
P13: Oh.

342
00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:33.030
P13: Might take me a little bit longer, like I say, because of my age, but I think it's… it's fairly easy.

343
00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:38.260
P13: Simple to do this way. But I also used to own my own business, so I'm used to…

344
00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:41.940
P13: to, you know, work… working with the IRS and…

345
00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:44.190
P13: Permits and all this type of thing.

346
00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:50.720
Moderator: And then, if you were doing this for real, would you expand these to double-check them?

347
00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:52.050
P13: Yeah, yeah.

348
00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:54.380
Moderator: Right. So you would. Gotcha.

349
00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:58.169
Moderator: Hey, that's pretty close to you.

350
00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:00.120
P13: Yeah, yeah, pretty close to my head.

351
00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:02.310
Moderator: My initials, anyway.

352
00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:06.690
P13: Yeah.

353
00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:09.530
Moderator: Alrighty.

354
00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:13.839
Moderator: Anything that you think is unclear here?

355
00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:19.920
P13: No, I think it's pretty clear.

356
00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:23.979
Moderator: Gotcha. Alright, let me pretend like we're submitting this.

357
00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:29.899
Moderator: And then you reach this page, and again, I ask you to kind of think out loud here.

358
00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:30.590
P13: Okay.

359
00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:37.650
P13: it just verifies that I've submitted the proper the proper documents.

360
00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:41.700
P13: Yeah.

361
00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:50.010
P13: What, you know, what's confusing to some veterans? Like, I have a veteran friend,

362
00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:58.260
P13: he'd have a hard time, even though he's younger than me, he has a hard time, navigating through VA.gov.

363
00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:04.290
P13: But it's just a matter of doing it a couple of times, and then…

364
00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:08.220
P13: You know, it gets to be fairly easy. But then there again.

365
00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:15.489
P13: All a vet has to do is go to the office they have on, at the VA Center here.

366
00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:16.960
P13: And they'll help you.

367
00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:21.819
Moderator: Gotcha. So, in your view, if you do it once or a couple of times, it's.

368
00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:22.200
P13: No.

369
00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:25.430
Moderator: And if you need help, then there is the…

370
00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:28.400
Moderator: VA facility for you to go to.

371
00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:30.859
P13: But I, I think, I think that,

372
00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:41.839
P13: I think that, maybe this, this, this process, compared to maybe 5 years ago? Yeah. You know, it's been developed

373
00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:46.610
P13: You know, I've been on, I've been on these,

374
00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:50.869
P13: what we're doing right now, I've done this for at least 5 years.

375
00:25:51.590 --> 00:26:00.060
P13: So, things seem to be a lot easier, because that's what… that's why you're doing this survey, I'm sure, because it makes things easier.

376
00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:03.790
P13: So.

377
00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:05.130
Moderator: Thank you for that feedback.

378
00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:13.250
P13: Yeah, I mean, it's been, you know, the process is successful, as far as I'm concerned.

379
00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:14.100
Moderator: Right.

380
00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:26.110
Moderator: So, on this page here, you have submitted your FMP claim, and then can you explain to me your understanding of what happens next, and any action you might need to take here?

381
00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:29.260
Moderator: So this is after you have submitted.

382
00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:30.120
P13: Well…

383
00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:32.090
Moderator: I also know that,

384
00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:35.349
P13: VA time is not normal time.

385
00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:39.009
P13: You can submit something, and if you're waiting for a claim.

386
00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:44.519
P13: You can expect it within 30 days, but it can take 90 days.

387
00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:47.290
P13: Right. VA time.

388
00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:52.910
P13: Also, if for any… I have submitted claims that have been denied.

389
00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:56.720
P13: But I just, I just request review.

390
00:26:57.330 --> 00:27:05.969
P13: And usually, if they've been reviewed, they accept it. I haven't been turned down permanently from anything.

391
00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:11.300
P13: They, they do have a, a process that,

392
00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:13.619
P13: Let's say you get turned down for,

393
00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:18.609
P13: even, like, a rating or something. You can request a high-level review.

394
00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:25.220
P13: And I have done that a couple times, and every time, they've, they've approved it.

395
00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:34.860
P13: You know, as an example, I went to, to, emergency department.

396
00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:36.500
P13: In August.

397
00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:42.349
P13: And, at first, when they got it.

398
00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:46.239
P13: They… they denied it, but when I… when I've…

399
00:27:46.510 --> 00:27:53.400
P13: asked a review, and then I was able to talk to somebody further about it, and they… and they, paid… laid my claim.

400
00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:58.060
Moderator: I gotcha. So, the whole VA process has been very…

401
00:27:58.470 --> 00:28:01.790
P13: Yeah, you just need to know what to do.

402
00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:02.890
Moderator: I gotcha.

403
00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:18.760
Moderator: And then, so on this, coming back to this page here, like, after you submit it, what is your confident rating, 1 being very low and 5 being very high, that your direct deposit is correctly set up based on this prototype and page here?

404
00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:19.770
P13: Oh.

405
00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:28.049
P13: Well, with this, this, with this protocol on this page here, I'd say a 5.

406
00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:28.890
Moderator: Okay.

407
00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:37.429
P13: If you put in the direct… the proper information you're gonna get… and they send out a, you know, reimbursement, it's gonna arrive.

408
00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:39.000
Moderator: Right, so you expect.

409
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:39.580
P13: Okay, no.

410
00:28:39.910 --> 00:28:42.699
Moderator: If the information's correct, then you'll expect to get…

411
00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:46.910
P13: Sure, I would… Okay. Yeah, I'd give it 4 or 5.

412
00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:47.580
P13: And then…

413
00:28:47.910 --> 00:28:53.719
Moderator: Is there anything about the direct deposit process that would make you not want to file your claim online?

414
00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:54.590
P13: No.

415
00:28:55.210 --> 00:28:57.379
P13: No. Well, what are you gonna do?

416
00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:01.510
P13: If you go down… if you go down to their claims office.

417
00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:05.700
P13: You're gonna wait a long time just to talk to somebody.

418
00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:12.950
P13: And then that's gonna take them a while. So this, this is definitely… Makes things a lot quicker.

419
00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:17.740
Moderator: Gotcha. Thank you for that. So I'll stop sharing here.

420
00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:22.409
P13: Again, there are a lot of vets that don't use VA.gov because they don't know.

421
00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:24.040
P13: No, that's available.

422
00:29:24.770 --> 00:29:26.540
Moderator: That… that makes sense. Yeah.

423
00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:30.849
P13: I do have a couple questions for you, and then we can…

424
00:29:30.850 --> 00:29:32.419
Moderator: End the interview.

425
00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:42.999
Moderator: So, what is your understanding on how the direct deposit, process works for the FMP claim, now that you've gone through this prototype?

426
00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:48.980
P13: I, I, I, I, I feel it's… It's fairly simple.

427
00:29:49.290 --> 00:29:53.159
P13: If you follow the steps the way, you know, one by one.

428
00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:55.900
P13: You're gonna get your claim.

429
00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:59.210
P13: Gotcha. Yeah, I agree.

430
00:29:59.210 --> 00:30:01.730
Moderator: Simple, and you expect to get your claim if you do it.

431
00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:02.679
P13: Absolutely, absolutely.

432
00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:11.180
Moderator: And then, what would be one thing that you would change to make it better for you about the current process as you understand it?

433
00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:20.970
P13: I, well…

434
00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:32.499
P13: I… I don't… I just know how to do it. I just know the process. I mean, if I… if I… something comes awry, I just… I know where to go to get help.

435
00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:33.270
Moderator: Yeah.

436
00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:39.900
P13: You know, I, I can even call, the, the, there's a VA1000 number.

437
00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:40.750
Moderator: Right.

438
00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:45.870
P13: that I can call, and they can get on the VA.gov site with me.

439
00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:47.190
Moderator: Gotcha.

440
00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:48.080
P13: Yeah, so…

441
00:30:48.410 --> 00:30:56.249
P13: I don't find it that difficult, personally. I'm sure that you come across veterans, they find it very…

442
00:30:56.780 --> 00:31:00.880
Moderator: But in general, for you, there's nothing you really felt the need to change.

443
00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:04.820
P13: I thought it was quite a nice process.

444
00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:13.499
Moderator: Okay. Now, think about having to contact the VA to set up a direct deposit for FMP. What is your thought on that extra step?

445
00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:19.630
P13: It's just… you're just making it easier.

446
00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:22.240
P13: Simpler, faster.

447
00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:24.959
P13: That's the way I feel.

448
00:31:25.170 --> 00:31:27.500
Moderator: Okay, so no issue for you again.

449
00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:28.820
Moderator: And…

450
00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:38.120
Moderator: And then, at the… overall, at the whole process, was there anything confusing, complicated, or that might cause you not to file your claim online?

451
00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:41.759
Moderator: The whole, prototype we just went through.

452
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:56.909
P13: I would definitely follow it online, because it takes a lot of time when you're involved, like, I can go get help at the VA, but you waste a lot of time, because you gotta… first of all, you gotta drive there, you gotta… you gotta get… sit in a room.

453
00:31:57.250 --> 00:32:01.559
P13: If there's an assistant to help you out.

454
00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:04.009
Moderator: Right. It depends on…

455
00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:05.250
P13: What their mood is?

456
00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:06.410
Moderator: Right.

457
00:32:06.410 --> 00:32:08.950
P13: You know, so it's a lot easier online.

458
00:32:09.330 --> 00:32:10.420
Moderator: I gotcha.

459
00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:11.419
P13: Bodies in life.

460
00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:18.469
Moderator: And then, what would make you confident that your reimbursement would actually get to your bank account once you file?

461
00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:21.499
P13: I've never… I have no doubt it's… I know it's gonna…

462
00:32:21.790 --> 00:32:24.399
P13: Yeah, I haven't… you know, I don't question that.

463
00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:25.760
Moderator: Alright.

464
00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:30.120
P13: That makes sense. I think this is fairly easy, the way you've set this up here.

465
00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:31.210
Moderator: Gotcha.

467
00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:34.309
P13: I really think so.

468
00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:39.369

00:32:43.930 --> 00:32:48.790
P13: I'm glad that the VA has… As, ask your assistance.

471
00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:50.570

472
00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:52.870

P13: No, I think I don't. I really don't.

474
00:32:57.050 --> 00:32:57.510
Moderator: Alright.

475
00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:07.829
Moderator: So, I want to circle back that, to kind of reinconfirm that you are comfortable if we decide to, share a video clip of this session with our VA partner.

476
00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:09.880
P13: Yes. Alright, good.

477
00:33:09.910 --> 00:33:15.920

478
00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:19.379
P13: You can even identify me, I don't care.

479
00:33:19.890 --> 00:33:24.509
Moderator: And then, was there any part that, you don't want to share in the video clip?

480
00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:28.759
P13: No, no, I'm, I'm, I'm wide open.

481
00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:30.060
Moderator: Okay.

482
00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:40.040
P13: I want to help, you know, because I know that a lot of veterans don't take advantage of, you know, the ability to be reimbursed.

483
00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:40.660
Moderator: Right.

484
00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:46.780

00:33:47.010 --> 00:33:48.480
P13: of the United States.

486
00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:54.929
P13: And then I… you know, I was able to get, you know, registered and what have you.

487
00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:56.190
Moderator: Gotcha.

488
00:33:56.410 --> 00:34:09.899
Moderator: I just want to say we really appreciate you taking your time with us to share your thoughts today. Your feedback will be very helpful as we kind of continue to, you know, make the site work for every veteran.

489
00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:22.530
Moderator: And then lastly, Harriet Giann did send you, like, will be sending you, like, a thank you note, with a little blurb that you can pass along to other veterans that you may know to provide them with a chance to, like, participate in…

490
00:34:22.610 --> 00:34:25.959
