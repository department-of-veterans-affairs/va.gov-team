00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:09.630
Renata: Okay, I have started the recording, and I'd like to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

2
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:10.860
P4: Yes.

3
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:19.970
Renata: Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?

4
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:21.180
P4: Yes.

5
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:30.920
Renata: Alright, so before we look at that, prototype I mentioned, I'll just start with a few warm-up questions. Do you have a service-connected disability with VA?

6
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.259
P4: I do.

7
00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.659
Renata: Alright, would you mind sharing what your disability rating is?

8
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:44.869
P4: I'm TDIU, so I'm 100%, but my regular rating is 90%.

9
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:52.190
Renata: Okay, got it. And do you receive direct deposits for your monthly compensation payments today?

10
00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:53.440
P4: I do.

11
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.649
Renata: Alright. Have you ever heard of the Foreign Medical Program through the VA before?

12
00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:05.630
P4: No. Just, like, a couple people, I guess, they mentioned it,

13
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:12.119
P4: If they live out of country, and they're on Reddit, I stay on Reddit a lot.

14
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:23.650
Renata: I can relate. So, in your own words, based just, sort of based on what you've seen on Reddit or talking with folks, can you describe the foreign medical program?

15
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.770
P4: I guess, to me, it's just like our program, it's just for if you're out of country.

16
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.820
Renata: Okay, got it. And it looks like you're on a mobile device today, is that correct?

17
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:38.600
P4: Yes, ma'am.

18
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:48.069
Renata: Alright, gotcha. So, I'm gonna drop a link into the chat, gotta pull that link up really quickly.

19
00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:58.290
Renata: I'm gonna drop a link into the Zoom chat, if you wouldn't mind opening the link, and then sharing your screen, and I can walk you through that if you'd like.

20
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.230
Renata: But I'm… drop that in there right now.

21
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.980
Renata: It might take a second to load the first time. Is it just sort of waiting?

22
00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.910
P4: Oh, I opened it, I'm just on the…

23
00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.640
Renata: Oh, gotcha.

24
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.020
P4: green part, yeah.

25
00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.400
Renata: Alright.

26
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.990
P4: It's been a while since I've… share the screen on Zoom.

27
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:55.990
Renata: Yeah, they don't make it easy.

28
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:18.479
Renata: All right, so before you get, scrolling around and clicking on stuff in here, just a reminder, this is a test, prototype, it won't function fully, but to get started, just take a minute to look over the content on this page, and think aloud, and then once you're done, I'll have some questions for you.

29
00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:20.810
P4: Okay.

30
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.549
P4: Well, I guess it works.

31
00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.110
P4: differently.

32
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.639
P4: You have to get built first.

33
00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.799
Renata: Differently from your current benefits that you receive?

34
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.590
P4: Yeah, cause I don't get… bill, they usually just bill the VA.

35
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:08.480
Renata: Okay, gotcha.

36
00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.899
P4: Yeah, I think that's the only thing I saw different.

37
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:44.880
Renata: Okay, so just a question for you before we go further into this prototype. Based on this page, what would you do next if you were filing your first FMP claim today?

38
00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:59.389
P4: I would assume click Get Started, and make sure I have all my documents present that I need.

39
00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.850
Renata: Okay, what all documents do you need?

40
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.660
P4: They said just supporting documents, so I'm assuming… It's,

41
00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:15.880
P4: the billing paperwork, basically proof that I paid for the services so I can get reimbursed for it.

42
00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:24.440
Renata: Okay, got it. You can scroll down now and click on that Get Started link.

43
00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:36.950
Renata: And we're just gonna pause here. So could you state in your own words what the information and the alert on the previous page meant to you without clicking back?

44
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:56.480
P4: basically just giving me a heads up on what I would need to continue through the claims process, like, if I don't have the itemized bill or any of the supporting documentation, that I probably won't be able to continue on until I have that information.

45
00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:08.650
Renata: Okay, got it. And on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being very difficult, and 5 being very easy, how would you rate the clarity of the information on that page, that first page you saw?

46
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.890
P4: You said with 1 being what?

47
00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.159
Renata: One being very difficult, and five being very easy.

48
00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.429
P4: I would say 5. Self-explanatory.

49
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.699
Renata: Anything in particular that made it that 5?

50
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:29.869
P4: They basically explain what you have to do.

51
00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:30.780
Renata: Okay.

52
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:35.700
Renata: You can go ahead and, click.

53
00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:52.870
Renata: on the continue to next task, that blue and white link. So just take a look at this page, and look over the direct deposit for foreign medical program information, and once you're done, let me know. Please just think aloud, and I'll ask you some more questions.

54
00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:54.260
P4: Okay.

55
00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:59.910
P4: Mainly direct deposit.

56
00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.349
P4: I don't think I've ever used the Financial Services Center.

57
00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.850
P4: site before, I'm assuming that's just for this program.

58
00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:36.150
P4: Yep.

59
00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:45.820
P4: I'm not sure what the PRV is.

60
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.560
Renata: The PAV? Okay.

61
00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.120
P4: Yep.

62
00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:56.420
Renata: Do you have Idini, by chance? Just curious.

63
00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:08.660
P4: I… I'm not sure if that's the one I used to sign in, because since they did the update and they took off the way I usually signed in.

64
00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:17.160
P4: It was two options. It was ID.me, and it was another one, and I think I used the other one, but I do have an ID.me account, though, just not for the VA.

65
00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:19.780
Renata: Gotcha, gotcha. Just curious.

66
00:08:38.429 --> 00:08:44.239
P4: Yeah, like this VAFSC vendor file form, I guess, because I don't have to deal with it.

67
00:08:44.429 --> 00:08:46.129
P4: I know nothing about it.

68
00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:47.490
Renata: Okay.

69
00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:55.090
Renata: Got it. In, so what are your impressions of this page?

70
00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:57.800
Renata: Having looked through it so far.

71
00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:06.820
P4: No… I guess, again, it's self-explanatory, especially if you… already…

72
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:10.309
P4: Went through the process of…

73
00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:13.990
P4: signing up for the Financial Services Center.

74
00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.120
P4: I don't recall signing up for that, because I think…

75
00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:20.399
P4: when I first got my,

76
00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:24.500
P4: VA.gov account, when they switched over from eBenefits.

77
00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:28.369
P4: All my direct deposit information transferred over.

78
00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:37.269
Renata: Got it, okay. So you've had your direct deposit information for your VA benefits for a while now.

79
00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:39.090
P4: Yeah, since, like, 2011.

80
00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:49.689
Renata: Okay, got it. Can you state in your own words the process and in what order you would do the setup for direct deposit for FMP claims?

81
00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:59.060
P4: I guess I would have to go on this financial services, center site.

82
00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.429
P4: I would have to,

83
00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:06.380
P4: I guess make sure I have all the information. I think they said something about, like, tax ID, and…

84
00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:10.839
P4: my banking information.

85
00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:18.380
P4: I'd have to… use, ID, me, or that VAPIV to sign into it.

86
00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:21.069
P4: And then, I have to…

87
00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:26.410
P4: do a vendor file form, which, like I said, I'm not familiar with that, so…

88
00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:30.680
P4: That's something I would have had to read up on.

89
00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:38.960
P4: And then, I guess after that, you just… Submit the information.

90
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:41.400
Renata: Okay.

91
00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:53.189
Renata: So same rating question as before, scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very difficult, and 5 being very easy. What would you rate the instructions that you've seen here?

92
00:10:54.480 --> 00:11:00.409
P4: I would say for me personally, because I haven't experienced some of the terminology on here, that it would be about a 3.

93
00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:08.090
Renata: A 3? Okay. And anything that you want to call out specifically as being either especially helpful or confusing to you?

94
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:14.659
P4: No, I really just don't know what that VAPIV is.

95
00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:15.450
Renata: Okay.

96
00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:21.679
Renata: Got it. You can go ahead and, scroll down the page at this point.

97
00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:27.310
Renata: I think click the Go to Foreign Medical Program.

98
00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:45.090
Renata: So you mentioned previously that you received disability compensation by a direct deposit. Now that you've seen, how to set up direct deposit for FMP, and based on what you know about your own VA disability compensation setup, do you think the process would be the same or different?

99
00:11:49.840 --> 00:12:06.590
P4: I still think it'll be different, because like I said, that site they have to go to, I've never had to go there. Like, usually I can just go on VA.gov, and then they'll tell me, if I want to update my direct deposit information, or add direct deposit information.

100
00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:10.010
P4: on the actual site. I don't have to go off-site.

101
00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:19.909
Renata: Got it. So, anything aside from going off-site, is there anything different that you would need to do for FMP claims?

102
00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:25.909
P4: That vendor process, I've never had to do that either.

103
00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:27.330
Renata: Okay.

104
00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:31.779
Renata: Got it. You can go ahead and click continue to next task.

105
00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:56.130
Renata: So at this point, we're going to imagine that we're filling out the FMP claims form, but we're also going to imagine that you've already filled out some of the basic sections of the form, so your name and personal information, mailing and contact info. So it's going to jump you into the middle of the form, just giving you a little…

106
00:12:56.130 --> 00:13:06.919
Renata: Heads up, so you know where you are. But I'm just gonna have you look at a few things in the form, and remember to think out loud, and I'll ask… I'll stop you when we have questions. You can go ahead and click that continue.

107
00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:19.309
P4: If you've already paid the provider, and if you approve the claim, we pay you my direct deposit bill.

108
00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:23.720
P4: The provider will send a check to the provider right now.

109
00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:28.730
Renata: So, what is this section asking you to do?

110
00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:33.430
P4: Basically, it's,

111
00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:40.670
P4: informing the VA if they have to pay you back, or if they have to pay the provider, so you just have to let them know

112
00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:47.209
P4: hey, I paid out of pocket, I want to be reimbursed, or hey, I didn't pay them yet, but I was billed.

113
00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:49.640
P4: So, here, you guys can go ahead and pay them.

114
00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:50.650
Renata: Okay.

115
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:54.720
Renata: Got it. Thank you. Anything unclear on this page?

116
00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:56.170
P4: No.

117
00:13:56.370 --> 00:14:02.559
Renata: Okay, you can go ahead and click, anywhere, on those radio buttons. I think it should just…

118
00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:03.730
Renata: Yep.

119
00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:09.740
Renata: Yeah, like I said, it's a prototype, it's a little different. You can go ahead and click continue.

120
00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:25.779
Renata: And, we're not going to ask you to upload any documentation or interact fully with the prototype here. Again, it'll just sort of be clicking stuff, but, can you just read aloud on this page? I got a couple of questions for you before we move on.

121
00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:26.950
P4: Okay.

122
00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:44.359
P4: Supporting files. Upload billing statement and supporting documents. Upload proof that you paid the provider. This can be a receipt or a billing statement that's marked as paid. Make sure it includes this information. Dates you paid the provider, care, services, medications, or supplies you paid for.

123
00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:54.230
P4: address of the provider or pharmacy, amounts you paid, supporting documents for certain claims. You'll need to upload additional documents for these types of claims.

124
00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:58.600
P4: Inpatient hospital care, medical devices, equipment, and supplies.

125
00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:11.100
P4: Prescription medications, COVID-19 vaccines, find out which documents you need, how to upload files, Yeah, upload files, yeah.

126
00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:17.630
Renata: All right. Anything that isn't clear, or that you would want more of an explanation on?

127
00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:20.110
Renata: If you were filling this out for real today.

128
00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:21.970
P4: Mmm…

129
00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:34.589
P4: Not really, because it seems mainly…

130
00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:42.480
P4: self-explanatory. You will want all your money back, so I would assume you want to make sure you have proof of

131
00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:45.119
P4: Basically, everything you paid for.

132
00:15:46.750 --> 00:16:02.080
Renata: Got it. So you can scroll down, and where it says drag or choose from folder for upload file, you can just sort of click there, and I believe it should… yep, it'll do the thing where it takes you to the top of the page, and then boom! A magical…

133
00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:06.150
Renata: been uploaded, and you can click continue again.

134
00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:16.240
Renata: So now this is the page, before you submit your forms. I'd just like you to take a look on it and just review the

135
00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.300
Renata: Let me know if anything stands out.

136
00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:22.030
P4: Okay.

137
00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:47.169
P4: It has two mailing addresses.

138
00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:50.960
Renata: Oh.

139
00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:53.840
Renata: Interesting. Okay.

140
00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:15.009
Renata: That might just be a quirk of our prototype. Like I said, this isn't actually, like, online, this is… this is just, like, a mock-up. But you can go ahead and… anything aside from the double mailing addresses that, like, stands out to you, or that you would want to do if this was a real claim that you were filing.

141
00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:18.150
P4: Mmm…

142
00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:30.930
P4: I'm assuming this part is because of the prototype, because it says, send payment to veteran mailing address.

143
00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:34.090
P4: Whereas previously, we were trying to set up direct deposit.

144
00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:47.589
Renata: Good question. I'm gonna be annoying and answer it with another question, which is, what would you want to see there if you had set up direct deposit, through FSC?

145
00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:54.360
P4: I would wanna see… That it was going to, like, what did they call it?

146
00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:59.359
P4: ACH, or direct deposit, because this would basically be me…

147
00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:04.370
P4: Checking the mailbox, not checking my bank account to see when it's gonna come.

148
00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:06.880
Renata: Mmm, okay.

149
00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:24.539
Renata: for a little bit, just curious, would you want it to say, like, direct deposit? Would you want to see the name of your bank? Would you expect to see, like, the last 4 digits of the account number? Like, what would help you know, like, this is going to a bank account as opposed to a check in the mail?

150
00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:33.069
P4: Yeah, for verification purposes, you know how most places or most sites, they'll have, like, account, and

151
00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:39.379
P4: And dot dot dot, or, like, the account number, routing number, and the name of the bank, or something like that.

152
00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:42.879
P4: Just so we'll know exactly where it's going, just in case.

153
00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:47.910
P4: If it's wrong, we can hurry up and… Fix the issue.

154
00:18:48.810 --> 00:19:02.059
Renata: Okay, got it. Thank you for that. You can go ahead and scroll down the page. We're gonna imagine that you have reviewed the rest of this, completed the statement of truth. Go ahead and click that submit button for me.

155
00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:15.919
Renata: Alright, so this is the page where you have submitted your F&P claim online. Can you explain to me your understanding of what happened next and what action you might take based on the content on this page?

156
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:17.600
P4: Okay.

157
00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:24.159
P4: So basically, right now, it would be…

158
00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:34.240
P4: The first thing I would do is I would either screenshot or print the information so I can have it for my records.

159
00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:35.310
Renata: Okay.

160
00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:40.639
P4: And then, there should be, I guess, like, a…

161
00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:44.989
P4: A status page that you can go to, just to see, like.

162
00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:49.029
P4: The progress, or if it's been approved, or whatnot.

163
00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:56.330
P4: So, I would basically just be waiting on that, because it has to get approved before you actually get sent anything.

164
00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:57.830
Renata: Okay.

165
00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:07.969
Renata: If such a status page existed, which we do not have a prototype of, for you to check today, but if such a thing existed, how frequently would you be checking that?

166
00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:13.460
P4: Mmm, I guess it would depend on my need.

167
00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:17.060
P4: If it's something I needed urgently, then…

168
00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:22.380
P4: I would probably do it like a lot of people do during tax time. I would frequently check it, but…

169
00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:32.619
P4: If it's just something that I want back, but I'm not pressed for, then every so often, I'll check, but they said, what, about 90 days or whatnot, so…

170
00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:35.489
P4: Maybe, like, once every few weeks.

171
00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:44.439
Renata: Okay, got it. Any action that you might take at this point, now that you've submitted your claim, based on what you're seeing on the screen?

172
00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:56.410
P4: I guess, like, if I feel it's taking too long, I can always contact the…

173
00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:59.280
P4: Number that they have on here.

174
00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:02.630
P4: And then if I feel like,

175
00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:11.650
P4: maybe I did something incorrect, or I messed up somewhere, then I know how I can contact them to see how I can fix what I messed up.

176
00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:17.519
P4: Because sometimes, you know, when you get into a rush and you're trying to knock some stuff out.

177
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:27.160
P4: it's not until after you already submitted it that you realize, hey, oh, wrong address, or I did a typo in the zip code, or something like that.

178
00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:34.700
Renata: I am all too familiar with doing that, so…

179
00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:51.489
Renata: I have another question for you. What is your confidence rating? So, that's that 1 to 5 scale, again, 1 being very low, 5 being very high, that you've set up your direct deposit correctly based on what you've seen in the prototype and on the page here. How confident are you?

180
00:21:54.410 --> 00:22:02.520
P4: I would say a 4, because I'm still stuck on that PIV and the vendor information that I've never had to deal with.

181
00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:14.720
Renata: Okay, that's fair. Is there anything, that would make you feel more confident, and help you with that vendor information stuff and logging into FSC?

182
00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:33.929
P4: I'm not certain, unless there's, like, a glossary or, like, further explanation on what the… Vendor side is.

183
00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:41.610
P4: Because I'm not sure if they're talking about, like, what is it, like,

184
00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:50.340
P4: a healthcare provider, or a different kind of health insurance, or, like, you know, I'm not sure what the actual vendor is.

185
00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:57.350
Renata: I gotcha, okay. Is there anything about the direct… wow, I can't talk, I'm sorry.

186
00:22:57.950 --> 00:23:05.200
Renata: Is there anything about the direct deposit process, that would make you not file your claim online that you've seen today?

187
00:23:06.810 --> 00:23:14.699
P4: No, not really. Like I said, there's usually a number or something you can call, so if you're having issues, someone will walk you through it.

188
00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:16.370
Renata: Okay.

189
00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:24.000
Renata: So that's all that we're gonna look at in the prototype. You can go ahead and stop sharing your screen. I have a few more questions for you before we wrap up, though.

190
00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:25.390
P4: Okay…

191
00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:36.159
Renata: Okay, so what is your understanding on how the direct deposit process for FMP claims works, now that you've gone through this prototype?

192
00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:50.599
P4: And basically, as long as you follow the steps, and you submit your documents, and you have

193
00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:56.590
P4: All your proofs, then… It should be an easy process.

194
00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:57.940
Renata: Okay.

195
00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:07.769
Renata: And what would be one thing you would change to make it better for you about the current direct deposit process for FMP claims, as you understand it?

196
00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:13.249
P4: Ugh, just about that vendor information.

197
00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:16.019
P4: I'm still stuck on that part.

198
00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:23.920
Renata: That's totally fair. Would it help if the instructions were broken out more?

199
00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:25.260
Renata: Or…

200
00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:33.329
Renata: Anything that you can think of at all that would help you feel more confident about that vendor information that it's asking for?

201
00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:41.130
P4: Yeah, I think it's just personally me, because I haven't experienced dealing with the foreign medical program. Maybe if it's someone that…

202
00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:47.790
P4: has to actually deal with it. They know exactly what the vendor information and stuff is, or if they have, like,

203
00:24:48.690 --> 00:24:52.740
P4: what's it called it? Like, a representative.

204
00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:56.820
P4: That they work with that actually explain the process and stuff to them.

205
00:24:58.570 --> 00:24:59.240
Renata: Okay.

206
00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:09.210
Renata: Think about the… having to contact the VA to set up direct deposit for FMP. What are your thoughts about that extra step if you needed to do it?

207
00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:22.620
P4: I think it's convenient, because not a lot of people are good with technology, so they may not be confident enough, and they can just call and probably have it set up that way.

208
00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:23.490
Renata: Okay.

209
00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:36.350
Renata: Aside from the vendor information step, was there anything about this process for direct deposit that felt confusing, complicated, or like it might not… it might cause you to not file your claim online?

210
00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:38.890
P4: No.

211
00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:39.980
Renata: Okay.

212
00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:46.480
Renata: And what would make you confident that your reimbursement would actually get to your bank account once you file that claim?

213
00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:56.310
P4: If I saw on a claim status page that it was approved.

214
00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:57.460
Renata: Okay.

215
00:25:58.790 --> 00:26:08.540
Renata: If there was not a claim status page, would you expect to receive an email, a letter? How would you expect to be notified about that claim being approved?

216
00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:12.690
P4: Yeah, usually it'd either be, like,

217
00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:18.840
P4: They do have a habit of either sending

218
00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:23.440
P4: An email, or they'll mail you a letter in the mail.

219
00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:32.809
P4: But I think, like, if they come across an issue, then they should be able to call, because then the issue can be fixed faster.

220
00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:51.240
Renata: Okay. I just want to check my understanding. It sounds like your preference is for a status page, so you can just sort of check, if something was wrong, say you slipped your finger on the keyboard, and you put an 8 instead of a 9 in your routing information, you're hoping you're going to get a phone call.

221
00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:53.649
Renata: About the… the issue.

222
00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:55.400
Renata: Is that correct? Okay.

223
00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:56.130
P4: Yep.

224
00:26:56.130 --> 00:27:07.949
Renata: Got it. Thank you for confirming. I always like to make sure I understand before I let folks go. Do you have any additional feedback about the content that we went over today?

225
00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:14.900
P4: No, it gives me a heads up if I do decide to go, you know.

226
00:27:15.970 --> 00:27:20.140
P4: To a foreign country, and have to deal with their medical program.

227
00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:26.810
Renata: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, do you have any, questions for me at this point?

228
00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:28.450
P4: No, ma'am.

229
00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:36.540
Renata: All right. I just wanted to circle back and reconfirm that you're comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners.

230
00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:37.920
P4: Yep.

231
00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:42.439
Renata: Is there any part of the discussion today that you would not want shared in a video clip?

232
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:44.040
P4: Nope.

233
00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:50.860
Renata: Alright, and as a reminder, we do remove any information that could be used to identify you before we share these internally at VA.

234
00:27:50.920 --> 00:28:04.869
Renata: But with that, I wanted to say, Tiffany, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is super helpful to us as we continue to work on the site to make sure it really works for veterans, so thank you.

235
00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:21.389
Renata: Lastly, Paragian, the folks who, set up the call and scheduled it with us today, will be sending you a thank you note. There's a little blurb in it that you can pass along to any other veterans you may know, that they can, gives them the chance to sign up for any future studies.

236
00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:26.210
Renata: But with that, thank you so much again. I hope you have a really great rest of your day and your week.

237
00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:28.150
P4: You too. Thank you.

238
00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:29.780
Renata: Alright, take care.

239
00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:31.299
P4: You too. Bye-bye.

240
00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:31.680
Renata: Bye.
