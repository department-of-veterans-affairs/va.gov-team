00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.340
Moderator: on the recording.

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:09.430
Moderator: Okay, did that record to the cloud? Let me make sure that was to the right spot.

3
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.320
Moderator: Okay, I think we're good.

4
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:21.749
Moderator: Okay, so as we had just went over, are you comfortable if we record our screen and audio as we talk today?

5
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.770
P2: Yes.

6
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:31.060
Moderator: And are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip with all personable identifiable information removed? Are you okay with that?

7
00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:32.130
P2: Yes.

8
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.560
Moderator: Okay.

9
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:42.780
Moderator: got through all of the permission warm-up questions. So, before we get to the prototype, I just want to check, do you have a service-connected disability through the VA?

10
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.870
P2: Yes.

11
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.359
Moderator: And do you mind sharing what your disability rating is?

12
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.769
P2: 100%.

13
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.690
Moderator: Okay.

14
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.449
Moderator: Do you receive direct deposit for your monthly compensation payments for that today?

15
00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:56.360
P2: Yes.

16
00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.629
Moderator: Thank you for sharing that.

17
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:07.080
Moderator: And then Paragene reported that you're enrolled or registered for the foreign medical program, but that you've never used your benefits, is that correct?

18
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:08.050
P2: Correct.

19
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.890
Moderator: Okay.

20
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.820
Moderator: Can you describe to me, in your own words, just what the program is to you?

21
00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.620
P2: The Foreign Medical Program.

22
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:17.230
Moderator: Yes.

23
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:29.740
P2: Well, yeah, it was designed for those of us that are stuck overseas to be able to, seek treatment for our service-connected conditions, and then apply for reimbursement for those.

24
00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:38.789
P2: I just happen to be fortunate. I'm, just minutes away from a major military treatment facility, so I've been able to get all my care through there so far.

25
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.630
Moderator: Awesome, that's great. Thank you for sharing that.

26
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.950
Moderator: Okay, and then are you on a mobile device or desktop computer today?

27
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:47.750
P2: desktop.

28
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:48.710
Moderator: Desktop.

29
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.860
Moderator: No worries, you need to figure out what link to share with you.

30
00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:00.470
Moderator: Okay, I'm gonna paste a link in chat to the design prototype that we'll be going over today.

31
00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:12.229
Moderator: And could you give you a moment to open that prototype if you want to close any screens or any personal stuff that you have open, just where it's just that one tab, and then share your screen when you're ready.

32
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:19.999
P2: Alright, let me… Let me do it this way, I'll,

33
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.070
P2: I'll do a new private window, and…

34
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.560
P2: Okay…

35
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.100
P2: And…

36
00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.910
P2: Okay.

37
00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.690
P2: So, other than, having the new browser window, so it's showing that it's still trying to…

38
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.260
Moderator: to load?

39
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:25.570
Moderator: Okay.

40
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.070
P2: Yeah. Give it just one second, and hopefully it hurries up and…

41
00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.520
Moderator: Loads for us.

42
00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.960
P2: It looks like it's supposed to have 6-packed abs, but it's struggling with 1, 3, 4, 5.

43
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.040
P2: There it goes. Okay.

44
00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:41.910
Moderator: Okay, good.

45
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:43.210
P2: Boop.

46
00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.719
P2: So, what would you like me to do now? Screen share?

47
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.310
Moderator: Yeah, if you could screen share, please, and let me know if you need any help talking through that.

48
00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.820
P2: I've never done before, so go ahead and talk and walk me, and we'll make it quicker.

49
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:05.870
Moderator: There should be a little box at the bottom of Zoom that says share, with, like, an arrow pointing up.

50
00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.460
Moderator: And if you click on that, it'll let you kind of navigate to the tab.

51
00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:12.779
Moderator: That you have?

52
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.919
P2: And… All right.

53
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.480
P2: There we go, let me see.

54
00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.040
P2: Alright, have it there?

55
00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.429
Moderator: It says it started screen sharing.

56
00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.820
Moderator: Give it a sec- there we go. Yes, I see it, perfect.

57
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:41.400
Moderator: Okay, so if you could just take a minute to look over this page, and just remember to think aloud of what you're seeing and what you think it's telling you to do next, please.

58
00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:42.530
P2: Oh, right.

59
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:49.199
P2: Aww… Wanna follow the plan…

60
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:13.560
P2: Okay, I'm, I haven't dealt with the Financial Service Center before, never even heard that term, so…

61
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.300
P2: I've… I've heard they've been working on,

62
00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.239
P2: electronic payments, so I'm not sure if that's related to that.

63
00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:28.079
P2: And is the, FSC outside of, the normal VA website?

64
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.699
Moderator: Yeah, what would you think of reading

65
00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.399
Moderator: This information here, how would you find that out?

66
00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:51.990
P2: Yeah, it, it seems to me that, and again, it's been an ongoing discussion about, FMP claims being paid via direct deposit, for the first time this year, because for years it's been checks only. But I've never heard anybody refer to the FSC portal.

67
00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.850
P2: So…

68
00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:05.680
P2: I just imagine that it's, probably independent of my disability pay, that it's probably a specific portal to the FMP

69
00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:13.780
P2: And then it has the phone number I can call, how to set up direct deposit for FMP claims,

70
00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:16.080
P2: Right.

71
00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.470
P2: Yeah, it looks, all pretty straightforward.

72
00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.710
P2: Do you want me to click on, the links?

73
00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:29.109
Moderator: Yeah, I guess based on this page, what would you do if you were filing your very first FNP claim today?

74
00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:37.309
P2: Well, it's, I would probably have to go back and read up on the program about… I've heard a lot of issues about, how to…

75
00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:38.330
P2: Aww.

76
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:45.220
P2: Gather all your billing statements, And, receipts for payment.

77
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:53.669
P2: So I would click on the link about find out what supporting documents you need, and just make sure I've got all the blocks checked before I,

78
00:06:53.720 --> 00:07:05.890
P2: go to that. But again, it looks like two separate things. This one is the file cover sheet, but then, separately, it's also talking about setting up direct deposit specifically for this.

79
00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:14.399
Moderator: Got it, thank you for explaining that. Can you click on that Get Started link at the bottom, please?

80
00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.270
P2: Oh, okay.

81
00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:33.699
Moderator: So, kind of, you stated very well in your own words with that previous information. An alert meant. On a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very difficult, and 5 being very easy, what would you write the clarity of the information on that previous screen?

82
00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:41.009
P2: I'd give it a 4, like I said, just because I'm a little unfamiliar with the process so far.

83
00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:42.630
Moderator: Okay.

84
00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:46.229
Moderator: Was there anything other than just, like, process?

85
00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.600
Moderator: That would be Nothing that can make it…

86
00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.470
P2: It's,

87
00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:59.309
P2: to me, it was kind of like, two disparate subjects, one talking about the FSC, and one talking about how to prepare a claim.

88
00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:05.620
P2: Because normally, like I said, I'm in some groups where we actually talk about the FMP a lot.

89
00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:09.390
P2: And, so, aww.

90
00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:13.880
P2: Yeah, I guess I'm, oh, my point is, so, normally.

91
00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:17.729
P2: we're all conditioned to go to our VA portal account.

92
00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:31.600
P2: And whatever is the default direct deposit information there is just there. And I haven't heard anybody discussing that, oh, okay, now there's a new option through the FSC to set that up.

93
00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:41.390
P2: I don't know, is that independently, separately? Does it already pull that information from where our current direct deposits go to? So, I'm a little vague on that.

94
00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:45.040
Moderator: Got it. Oh, that's really helpful feedback, thank you.

95
00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:49.260
Moderator: You can go ahead and continue on to the next task.

96
00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:50.060
P2: Okay.

97
00:08:50.350 --> 00:09:01.500
Moderator: And kind of same drill on this page, just take a minute to look it over, and please remember to just think aloud, and just tell us in your own words what this page is telling you to do.

98
00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:10.809
P2: Yeah, so just initially, obviously, you know, kind of answers the question that this is a specific direct deposit strictly for FMP.

99
00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.790
P2: As opposed to anything related to VA.

100
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.019
P2: Which is good to know, the guys will be happy.

101
00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:25.129
P2: Oh, da-da-da… Again, reference to the FSC, new term for me.

102
00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:38.030
P2: And it answers my question, we'll use that account information for your reimbursement. So, if I've already got it there, hopefully it'll pull that and I can just verify the information.

103
00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:42.370
P2: Helped us to call and complain.

104
00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:51.500
P2: And if you've never used FSC Portal, then yes, this is my opportunity to do that.

105
00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:53.670
P2: independently.

106
00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:09.000
P2: And I'm hoping, from the information it's presenting me with here, because this is where there's been some clash for a lot of us that live overseas, is,

107
00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:13.239
P2: this forced implementation of ID.me

108
00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:20.249
P2: As the only sign-in option, where a lot of us have used previous passwords, we've used,

109
00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:23.979
P2: I just forgot the name of the,

110
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:29.599
P2: the default login that we've always used for military websites.

111
00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:36.080
P2: crap, I can't remember it. Anyway, so we previously had, you know,

112
00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:50.580
P2: email and password, the OMB version of the sign-in, then they said, oh, now you have your choice of using login.gov or ID.me, and then after they got people doing that, then they said, oh, forget that, we're taking away login.gov.

113
00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:57.229
P2: now it's only ID.me, and for a lot of these guys, they haven't been in the States for so long, they don't have…

114
00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:09.430
P2: driver's licenses or state IDs, they've had problems with their passports, and so a lot of them have had problems trying to get an… create an account with ID.me.

115
00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:10.720
P2: And,

116
00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:27.699
P2: So it looks a little different here that, so I'm reading step 2, set up direct deposit needed. I need that information, but then I get to step 3, and it's like, oh yeah, by the way, we still have to use ID.me as your sign-in for, for that. And,

117
00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:33.689
P2: Yeah, and it's a… it's a death loop when it says if you don't have a VAPIV, you can create an account.

118
00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:41.770
P2: And it never works, because we always have to do video, approval, and I've gotten rejected every single time.

119
00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:47.019
P2: Complete the VA FCC vendor file form. Did you have a question?

120
00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:47.770
P2: Nope.

121
00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:48.639
Moderator: Oh, go ahead.

122
00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:52.970
P2: after selecting the VSC vendor file form.

123
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:57.970
P2: Okay, that's a new one. Button on the customer engagement portal home.

124
00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:03.059
P2: Register button, and okay, complete that, 5 sections… da-da-da-da-da…

125
00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:07.580
P2: Then OK, and review your information and finish.

126
00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:10.410
P2: Okay.

127
00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:15.619
P2: And now you're ready to file your FMP claim. Okay.

128
00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:17.470
P2: Aww.

129
00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:19.290
P2: I would… no.

130
00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:23.270
P2: I would say no, probably between those two pages.

131
00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:33.790
P2: Again, as a first-timer, I would probably rather be first redirected to a, the worksheet page for exactly what all I need to have.

132
00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:46.539
P2: the forms, because we, like, we just had a guy that, got blocked because, the PDFs weren't uploading, and it didn't say if it was a file size, or if there was some format, or there were too many.

133
00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:47.600
P2: So…

134
00:12:47.850 --> 00:13:01.019
P2: I guess I would like to probably, from that first page to this page, actually, work… go through the worksheet for, preparing and uploading my claim before getting to the payment portion.

135
00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:04.470
Moderator: Got it, that's really helpful feedback.

136
00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:08.589
Moderator: Yeah, is there anything else about the process order?

137
00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:10.460
Moderator: That you would like to change here?

138
00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:21.389
P2: Don't, no, every, everything, you know,

139
00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:34.049
P2: kind of flows, again, this has been a common complaint is, when you're being redirected from, some of these, VA pages.

140
00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:36.650
P2: From the previous website.

141
00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:39.010
P2: it.

142
00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:45.400
P2: forces you over to the ID.me registration page, And…

143
00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:58.300
P2: I don't know if it's… because some of us have to use VPNs, because we just get, like I said, we get stuck in these doom loops, and… with ID.me, and you just can't get out of them, so I hope…

144
00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:08.490
P2: that it opens up a separate login page, because you can never go backwards, because, like I said, it won't let you back out. So, I hope that

145
00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:15.580
P2: it… I could go ahead and processed my…

146
00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:20.310
P2: Payment, because this is one of the other issues we were discussing is,

147
00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:28.350
P2: For those of us that have been having issues with doing the online submissions, we'd still like to make sure that everything we're doing

148
00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:38.299
P2: is still… Being either uploaded or saved to our account in case we have to submit it manually.

149
00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:50.219
P2: So that it's like, oh, sorry, you couldn't get any further in this process, so we just blew everything up. We just erased that whole session. So I hope there's something about this that, is,

150
00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:51.470
P2: Aww.

151
00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:59.050
P2: Either filling out forms along the way, to where it'll either give me the option for an electronic submission, or

152
00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:02.070
P2: Print it out and submit it manually.

153
00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.829
Moderator: Got it. It's really great feedback, thank you.

154
00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:12.189
P2: Because I just remember another thing, because that's… we've had that issue come up with some people that are,

155
00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:17.019
P2: helping… Do these submissions on behalf of a veteran.

156
00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:35.040
P2: that either, you know, for whatever their disability or restrictions, they're not able to do it themselves. So, that's why these things end up turning into almost a pen and paper worksheet, and then they have to go back to the provider and say, hey, I need this information, as opposed to losing everything, because it was just one

157
00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:40.230
P2: you know, continuous, session, because I'm not technically logged into anything yet.

158
00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:42.380
Moderator: Yeah, that makes sense.

159
00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:55.479
Moderator: Yeah, and same as on the previous page, doing the scale rating thing again, 1 to 5, 1 being very difficult, and 5 being very easy. Where would you rate the instructions on this page?

160
00:15:55.880 --> 00:16:05.499
P2: For the instructions, I'd give it a 3, simply because there's, you've got…

161
00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:07.800
P2: 3 different actions.

162
00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:15.949
P2: on the same page, dealing with the direct deposit, doing that if it hasn't been done yet, then signing into the FSC,

163
00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.890
P2: And then having to go through and do the,

164
00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:22.399
P2: Vendor file form, which again, never heard of that.

165
00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:28.630
P2: Probably gonna be new to a lot of these guys, and Yeah.

166
00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:34.359
P2: So, yeah, I just, I won't say it's like drinking from a fire hose.

167
00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:41.259
P2: But for a first-timer, it's like, oh man, I gotta do all that just to start working on my form, so, yeah.

168
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:42.760
Moderator: God.

169
00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:45.329
Moderator: Very helpful feedback to say that, thank you.

170
00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:54.530
Moderator: And then before we move on, is there anything else you'd like to call out on this page as being especially confusing, or maybe helpful?

171
00:16:55.310 --> 00:17:02.909
P2: Oh… So, like I said, when, when I read, complete the VA…

172
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:07.310
P2: financial service center vendor file form.

173
00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:13.380
P2: It…

174
00:17:14.349 --> 00:17:33.960
P2: Where it says, you know, complete the five-section social security number. Okay, now I'm wondering, we're talking about the vendor, isn't that the person that provided the service or the billing? And why would they have a social security number? Because we're overseas. They don't have social security numbers, they don't have tax IDs, they may have, you know, payee information and the rest.

175
00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:39.609
P2: But, I'm… I've got a disconnect, unless that's a…

176
00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:44.950
P2: A new form or a different form, Oh… Because I'm… I'm…

177
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:56.039
P2: I'm going up to the previous section, item number 2, where I'm doing direct deposit. Well, all that applies to me, so I understand that, but I don't understand who the vendor is.

178
00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:02.260
Moderator: Got it. Thank you for explaining that and providing that feedback. That's good for us to know.

179
00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:07.650
Moderator: And now if you could just go ahead and click anywhere to proceed through.

180
00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:08.820
P2: Okay.

181
00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:11.530
Moderator: Prototype should let us go.

182
00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:24.370
Moderator: Okay, so you've mentioned you received disability compensation via direct deposit, too, and now that you've seen, kind of, this information about how FMP could work, is there anything that…

183
00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:32.379
Moderator: like, kind of looking at both process that would be the same or different in your mind? Can you just kind of explain your thinking of comparing the two?

184
00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:37.849
P2: Just that, I think for a lot of us, yeah.

185
00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:47.060
P2: Because… because we did set up, direct deposit so many years ago, that…

186
00:18:48.530 --> 00:19:04.869
P2: I'm… I couldn't… I couldn't even begin to tell you what I filled out at the time, if it just… you know, because I think, you know, DFAS… I was in a hospital, I think DFAS handled all that stuff for me at the time, and if they just, you know, ported all that information over to the VA,

187
00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:22.140
P2: I don't, you know, it's been a while, I don't remember doing it, so… but I… I have tracked as they've gone through these different permutations of, you know, how the VA website, your e-benefits portal, and your VA portal, and they've… they're, like, on their third version in the last 10 years now.

188
00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:28.549
P2: So, I've forgotten so much of that, and now that I can't get in because of ID.me,

189
00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:34.590
P2: I'm, It's probably just,

190
00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:43.239
P2: getting familiar now that this is a different process of, of the medical claims that, you know, I'll have to get oriented to.

191
00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:47.899
Moderator: Got it, thank you for that feedback.

192
00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:51.309
Moderator: We can go ahead and click on continue to next task.

193
00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:54.980
Moderator: And…

194
00:19:55.100 --> 00:20:05.810
Moderator: Now we're kind of gonna skip and go fast through the form, so imagine you've filled out a few sections here, and you entered in all of your personal information, and now you've arrived at this page.

195
00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:14.260
Moderator: So, you've, like, midway through the form, and what was this section asking you to do, and is anything unclear on this page?

196
00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:19.870
P2: Okay… Tell us if we should send any payments for this claim to you or to the provider.

197
00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:47.629
P2: Yeah, so, same old, same old. Looks, looks, as I said, even with the paper checks, whether you got it yourself or sent it to your provider, all looks the same.

198
00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:54.049
Moderator: Okay. Anything unclear that you would need more explanation on?

199
00:20:54.350 --> 00:21:00.379
P2: No? No, it's like I said, that's… those are… that's always the only two questions. Do we send it to you, or to the provider?

200
00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:06.460
Moderator: Got it. Okay, you can go ahead and click that continue button in the prototype to move on.

201
00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:10.690
P2: Or click.

202
00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:14.789
Moderator: Click on the veteran button. Actually, up on the veteran's name.

203
00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:15.630
P2: Oh, okay.

204
00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:19.560
Moderator: And then click continue.

205
00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:21.310
P2: Alright.

206
00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:32.869
Moderator: Okay, and being a prototype, you won't be uploading any documentation, of course, but if you could just kind of click through these next couple screens, and just think aloud, and let us know what it's telling you to do.

207
00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:38.570
P2: Okay, upload receipts, billing statement, marked paid.

208
00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:41.120
P2: Do you provide care?

209
00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:46.620
P2: Right.

210
00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:52.740
P2: Okay, so yeah, it just,

211
00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:59.639
P2: Standard stuff for the, billing statements, supporting documents for certain claims, you'll need to…

212
00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:14.600
P2: Okay, inpatient hospital care, medical device equipment, prescription medicines, COVID-19, okay, and then finding out what documents, for those, because there's a lot of issues with medical devices and prescriptions over here.

213
00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:22.410
P2: Use JPEG, PDF, or PNP files, make sure 10 megabits or less. You only have paper copy.

214
00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:24.820
P2: Scan or take photo, upload file…

215
00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:32.740
P2: Yeah,

216
00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:46.290
P2: Yeah, I've had to explain to some of the older guys how to reduce their file size, and how to split up PDFs so it fits, so, yeah. Yeah, all pretty straightforward, and then go ahead and continue.

217
00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:48.099
Moderator: Yeah, go ahead.

218
00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:53.080
Moderator: Click the upload box, we'll pretend we're uploading a file.

219
00:22:56.670 --> 00:22:58.290
Moderator: And there's our file.

220
00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:00.810
P2: Explanation of benefits, I know that term.

221
00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.769
P2: Okay, review and audit, okay.

222
00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:13.299
P2: Da-da-da… okay, I'm Richard Williams today. Hey! It's only 2 months off from my actual birthdate!

223
00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:14.610
Moderator: Thanks.

224
00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:15.240
P2: Ugh.

225
00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:19.449
P2: Oh, da-da-da…

226
00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:27.250
P2: Okay… I'm not sure.

227
00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:33.079
P2: Now, now you're into my territory.

228
00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:42.840
P2: For mailing address, it's always a sticky wicket over these issues of, format, and aww.

229
00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:58.110
P2: countries, being able to recognize the different postal codes, state, region, province. If, you know, like in this instance, you know, that's a two-letter designator that's gonna allow for more information.

230
00:23:58.270 --> 00:24:02.600
P2: Because we've run into a lot of these forms that just… they weren't free text.

231
00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:18.920
P2: there are other drop-downs, or they were formatted, they would just give… return you with… return constant error messages with no explanation. It's been nightmarish. So, I… I hope they take that into very careful consideration, all the, options.

232
00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:24.289
P2: That some, you know, a lot of veterans would typically enter in these fields.

233
00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:31.110
P2: Oh… And then… so I've got, let's see here…

234
00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:34.110
P2: So we've got two options for mailing addresses.

235
00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:38.529
P2: Is one of those supposed to be for the provider? Vendor?

236
00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:40.810
P2: Just ignore that.

237
00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:52.819
Moderator: Yeah. Prototype, kind of more just kind of looking through the content. I guess if this was a real form, would you kind of go through everything this thoroughly after you had entered it in, too?

238
00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:59.859
P2: Oh, yeah, yeah, because, I mean, if you've been on this end and you've had something kicked back because of one form-filled entry error.

239
00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:01.530
P2: Yeah, yeah.

240
00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:15.209
P2: Yeah, people blow up the Facebook page over that kind of stuff. It's like, you wouldn't believe what they did to me! And, same thing with form number. I hope they've got all their international codes and everything sorted out there.

241
00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:17.420
P2: Da-da-da…

242
00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:19.990
Moderator: That's really helpful feedback to add in.

243
00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:24.790
Moderator: Even though we're kind of just exploring a prototype that doesn't quite work like you would.

244
00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:27.730
P2: Send payment and veteran address.

245
00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:37.660
P2: Payment selection… Okay, that's… Those two don't…

246
00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:45.199
P2: Seemed to agree together, using the term payment selection, with supporting files.

247
00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:48.210
P2: Payment selection to me.

248
00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:55.879
P2: Would mean, you know, the same thing up here, because up here it says payment options, and sending payment to the veteran

249
00:25:56.010 --> 00:26:04.370
P2: Or the supplier, payment selection, linking this to files doesn't make any sense.

250
00:26:05.910 --> 00:26:09.440
Moderator: I think we have an issue with our prototype, our stuff got shuffled.

251
00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:10.310
P2: Oh, okay.

252
00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:14.739
Moderator: Oh, we'll pretend all of this is correct information, and you double-checked it.

253
00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:18.120
P2: Was there any other reason in a real scenario?

254
00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:22.350
Moderator: That you would not send it if all your information checked out.

255
00:26:23.610 --> 00:26:28.700
P2: Oh… That I would not send it?

256
00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:37.339
Moderator: Yeah, if you went through, everything matched exactly as you expected of what you entered, would you be ready to hit submit, or would you need to do anything else first?

257
00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:40.269
P2: Let me see…

258
00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:47.330
P2: Hmm…

259
00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:53.670
P2: -Oh.

260
00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:59.180
P2: Can't think offhand of anything else… Awww.

261
00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:01.090
P2: It would be irrelevant.

262
00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:04.129
P2: Nope. Seems pretty straightforward.

263
00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:13.489
Moderator: Got it, awesome. Go ahead and click the submit, like it all checked out, and submitted your…

264
00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:15.410
P2: Can't eat everything.

265
00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:29.350
Moderator: Not in the prototype, but in real life, you would actually sign it and do it. So, now you've submitted your first FMP claim online. Can you explain to me your understanding of what happens next, and if you need to take any action?

266
00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:38.340
P2: Oh… Normally, no, you know, the forms go in, they usually will, Aww.

267
00:27:38.830 --> 00:27:53.910
P2: people have been… different people have had different responses as to, whether they're able to go in there, check their claim, if they get an acknowledgement, or the status of it, or if they need any additional supporting information. You know, it's… it's never send it.

268
00:27:53.970 --> 00:28:01.749
P2: you know, get a check. It's, a lot of people have, you know, they've had to, amend their submissions,

269
00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:10.390
P2: Maybe get an itemized for, more itemization of a particular, part of the claim.

270
00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:13.849
P2: So, yeah, no, it's…

271
00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:30.659
Moderator: Got it. After going through all of that, what is your confidence rating, 1 being very low and 5 being very high, that you've set up direct deposit correctly based on the prototype content and instructions?

272
00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:35.370
P2: Yeah, if, like I said, if I'd, gone to that FSC site and…

273
00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:45.330
P2: everything went through, as indicated. You know, I'd be confident about that. I know… Aww.

274
00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:53.139
P2: I'm not sure if it's a… if it's a function of the FSC site, where

275
00:28:53.200 --> 00:29:02.340
P2: you know, if you're, you know, using, like, Zelle, or here in the UK, the different payment systems, is it always validates your information?

276
00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:13.709
P2: So as soon as you start typing a bank, it'll say, okay, I got this, you know, it's Bank of America, blah blah blah, and it goes through and makes sure, makes sure that,

277
00:29:14.130 --> 00:29:15.170
P2: your…

278
00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:33.600
P2: your information is formatted, you know, according to, you know, the banking standards for all that. So, and normally that's your confirmation, okay, at least I submitted everything in the correct format. That's not going to backfire on me, so, assuming that all operates as such, and…

279
00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:47.289
P2: I did the FSC and, you know, got some kind of, you know, confirmation that, my direct deposit was successfully, you know, set up, then… then all the rest of this is, you know, secondary to that.

280
00:29:49.820 --> 00:30:00.640
Moderator: Got it. So you'd expect the confirmation that you had it all set up, and then… is there any other hurdles? I know you mentioned ID me, but just any other hurdles in this process that you would like to call out?

281
00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:02.080
P2: Oh…

282
00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:21.790
P2: No, you know, I'm seeing on the pages where it says, you know, we've saved your progress to this point, you know, if you want to go back a previous page, or if you want to come back later. So, you know, that's all the pertinent stuff. Like I said, I know for a lot of folks,

283
00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:27.110
P2: if… They were able to… Aww.

284
00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:38.269
P2: print out what they had, submitted so far, or if they were stuck on a particular page.

285
00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:52.130
P2: that they weren't completely sure about, and like I said, whether they needed to go back to the veteran, or to the center, where they got the services, to say, you know, do you know what this means? They say, I have to fill this out. So if there was a…

286
00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:59.090
P2: Some way to ensure that, as they're providing the information.

287
00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:11.950
P2: that it also is able to convert it to a printable form that they can, you know, download, and say, yeah, I don't know what this means, and take it to, like, a

288
00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:22.509
P2: veteran service officer, you know, if they have… if they're, you know, because some of our VSOs help people with the… with the FMP claims, or that if they had to go back to the

289
00:31:22.530 --> 00:31:24.470
P2: providing facility.

290
00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:31.320
P2: to say, you know, is this correct? You know, is this the correct information? Because obviously, you know, they're not gonna…

291
00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:39.310
P2: you know, haul around a laptop or, you know, try and do everything on their phone. You know, they'd rather have something in writing that, if they had to email that.

292
00:31:39.410 --> 00:31:47.979
P2: you know, to the provider, or if somebody… and I… and I even know people that live overseas have a, like a child.

293
00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:59.129
P2: Living stateside that's doing this stuff for them, if they had to email stuff back and forth, versus granting them access to their, you know, portal, you know, might be a consideration.

294
00:31:59.870 --> 00:32:05.939
Moderator: Got it. Yeah, it's really great feedback to share. Thanks for sharing all those other little tidbits. It's helpful to hear.

295
00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:16.789
Moderator: And as we're kind of on that topic, kind of magic wand scenario, if there's one thing you could change about the F&P direct deposit explanation that you saw here today.

296
00:32:16.890 --> 00:32:18.190
Moderator: What would it be?

297
00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:25.660
Moderator: Just kind of thinking through those steps and process within the content.

298
00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:27.590
P2: Oh…

299
00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:37.540
P2: I… I think because,

300
00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:53.990
P2: So, I'm in the UK, we have a National Health Service, so a lot of… a lot of the veterans over here between the base hospital and NHS, they're usually able to cover about 90% of what they need.

301
00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:56.869
P2: And so, for that reason.

302
00:32:57.100 --> 00:33:13.470
P2: Like me, they could be here for years with never having to submit, you know, they're getting services, but none of them are claimable, because everything's being taken care of. So then they may hit that glitch, where it's like, oh, crap.

303
00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:23.820
P2: I have to do this one, but… In the interim, if… the whole FSC direct deposit

304
00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:31.880
P2: Was making sure, my magic wand, that that's a separate page without having to go through all this other crap.

305
00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:47.410
P2: saying, you know, first time, you know, while working with FMP, because this is what's actually happening in our forum discussions, is, like me, it's like, well, by golly, I want to make sure I get that squared away before I need it.

306
00:33:47.680 --> 00:34:02.439
P2: So, for a lot of these guys, if they can… if they knew, as a lot of them are being told, because what they're doing is they're actually sending out invites for people to start to sign up for their direct deposit, and only a few of us have seen those.

307
00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:11.009
P2: So, for those of us that haven't got that invite yet, we don't know what that looks like, but it's being… currently, it's being handled as a separate process.

308
00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:14.459
P2: So, if this had…

309
00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:28.099
P2: on that very first page said, you know, if you're new to FMP and you just wish to set up your FSC at that, your direct deposit at this time, here's a direct link, bypass all this other minutiae.

310
00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:30.399
Moderator: Got it.

311
00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:32.119
Moderator: That is helpful, thank you.

312
00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:36.779
Moderator: And then I'm kind of thinking about if you got to a situation where you had to call

313
00:34:36.889 --> 00:34:41.379
Moderator: the VA or someone to set up direct deposit. What are your thoughts about that step?

314
00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:50.519
P2: Again, that's, that's what they've told all of us that have had problems with IDME is, well, you can just call.

315
00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:52.719
P2: So,

316
00:34:52.770 --> 00:35:12.119
P2: But like I said, I've been trying to, you know, well, let's just fix the ID me issue. I'm not gonna… I'm not gonna go around the problem, we're gonna fix it. So, I've stubbornly have not, you know, called in to say, hey, you know, I want, you know, this percentage of my check to go into my UK bank account, which is what I want.

317
00:35:12.210 --> 00:35:18.859
P2: So… Again, the only thing,

318
00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:36.350
P2: I would want to know is, I hate duplicity, is whatever I'm doing online should be the exact same thing I'm going to be talking about on the phone or via mail. So, again, if it's like, you know, here's… here's what the FSC Center does to set up your direct deposit.

319
00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:41.590
P2: If you're not able to, you know, sign in at this time.

320
00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:48.149
P2: Same thing, it's like, here's everything we're gonna need, when you call the center.

321
00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:59.020
P2: Versus, you know, some of these guys… I mean, I've… I've seen guys, it's taken, you know, 3 days to figure out all their banking information for the foreign bank. So again, if it,

322
00:35:59.110 --> 00:36:09.080
P2: presented everything on that same page. It's like, you can either do it online here, or have all this information ready when you call the center.

323
00:36:10.410 --> 00:36:11.170
Moderator: Got it.

324
00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:12.969
Moderator: It's very helpful.

325
00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:21.469
Moderator: Okay, we've talked about direct deposit a lot today. Do you have any other additional feedback that you would like to share about the content that we went over?

326
00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:31.049
P2: No, it looks like all the standard VA stuff, pretty straightforward, you know, saving progress, and

327
00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:34.040
P2: Yeah, so…

328
00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:39.199
Moderator: Great, any questions for me before we wrap up?

329
00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:52.149
P2: No, I would, I would just want to make sure that, people can, get into this page… page of the site without having to log in first, so again, they can access all the information.

330
00:36:52.150 --> 00:37:05.100
P2: You know, before proceeding. So, because I've… some people have sent me links, it's like, you know, well, that's… that's after you log in, and I'm not there yet. You know, I just want to be able to see the stuff without, having to get logged in first.

331
00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:05.750
P2: So…

332
00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:08.839
Moderator: Yeah, that totally makes sense, and it's great feedback.

333
00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:19.440
Moderator: Alright, well, I just want to circle back and reconfirm, now that we've gone through everything. Are you comfortable if we decide to share a video clip with everything scrubbed with our VA partners?

334
00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:20.300
P2: Yes.

335
00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:21.570
Moderator: Okay.

336
00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:32.320
Moderator: And like I said, just to remind you to remove all identifiable information before we do that. So, thank you, we really appreciate you taking the time to share all of your thoughts with us today as we try and

337
00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:48.029
Moderator: work on making the website better for veterans and their family, and make it more clear, so… Okay. And then, lastly, Paragian, who recruited you, they'll be sending you a thank you note that you can pass along if anyone else wants to participate, or if you've done this a lot, you know the drill, so…

338
00:37:48.030 --> 00:37:48.460
P2: Okay.

339
00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:49.890
Moderator: Thank you very much.

340
00:37:49.890 --> 00:37:56.649
P2: I'm gonna let you in on a little secret now. 30 years ago, I was a user interface engineer.

341
00:37:56.650 --> 00:37:58.999
Moderator: Nice. You know the drill.

342
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.750
P2: I know the drill! I can pick apart a website in no time.

343
00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:08.669
Moderator: Awesome. Well, your feedback was really, really helpful today, so thank you for your time.

344
00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:11.390
P2: Certainly, all right. Have a great day.

345
00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:12.560
P2: Alright, bye now.

346
00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:13.290
Moderator: Bye.
