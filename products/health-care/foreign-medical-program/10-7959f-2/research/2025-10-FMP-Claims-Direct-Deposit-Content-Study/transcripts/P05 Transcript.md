00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:09.590
Moderator: Okay, I have started the recording. I'd like to confirm that you are comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today.

2
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.020
P5: Yes, I am.

3
00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:22.909
Moderator: Okay, and then, are you comfortable we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with our VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?

4
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:24.609
P5: Yes, I am.

5
00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:34.939
Moderator: Alright, great, thank you! Alright, all the boiler plates are over, and then we'll kind of start here. So, we'll start with a few warm-up questions.

6
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:42.730
Moderator: Before we look at the website, do you have a service-connected disability at the VA?

7
00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.530
P5: Yes, I do.

8
00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.050
Moderator: And then, do you mind sharing what your disability rating is?

9
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.680
P5: It is 80%.

10
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:57.430
Moderator: Okay, and then, have you ever… So…

11
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:04.059
Moderator: Do you receive direct deposit from your monthly compensation, or your monthly compensation payment?

12
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.540
P5: Yes, I do.

13
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:11.180
Moderator: Okay, and then have you heard of the foreign medical program through the VA before?

14
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.400
P5: No, I have not.

15
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:21.379
Moderator: Okay. And then, if you have not, can you describe in your own word what you think it would be?

16
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:30.360
P5: It sounds like a service related to… Receiving care, maybe, overseas?

17
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.580
Moderator: Okay. And then, have you ever, filed a reimbursement claim before?

18
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.390
P5: No, I have not.

19
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:46.309
Moderator: Alright, and then on your, are you on a mobile device today, or a desktop computer?

20
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:47.790
P5: I am on a desktop.

21
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.300
Moderator: Okay, desktop.

22
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:58.960
Moderator: Alright, so, since you're on a desktop, I will give you a, desktop Prototype 2.

23
00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.330
Moderator: Go to here.

24
00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.670
Moderator: Give me a second while I do that.

25
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:16.530
Moderator: So I will share a link with you, And then… You can click on that.

26
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.529
Moderator: And then, so it'll open up the prototype, which takes a little bit of time, and then…

27
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.360
Moderator: Once that's ready,

28
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.179
Moderator: Let me know if you're able to share your screen, you know, with the prototype in there.

29
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:42.480
P5: Yeah, I have it open, let me see… How to share my screen…

30
00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.409
P5: Is it? Oh, sorry. Wow, I see it. Green button.

31
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.140
P5: Okay.

32
00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:11.759
Moderator: Alright, so… What we'll do is that,

33
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.549
Moderator: Sorry, for the first task here,

34
00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:27.190
Moderator: What you're gonna do is you're gonna look at this page, and then you're gonna go through it. Take a minute or so, and think out loud as you're going through this.

35
00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.680
P5: Okay, gotcha.

36
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:39.260
P5: So, I'm seeing this is about filing for a claim…

37
00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:55.440
P5: And then, yeah, as I kind of mentioned earlier, it looks like it's for medical care outside of the US, but it's for service-connected conditions. So, yeah, that tells me it needs to be service-related for this.

38
00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:09.659
P5: I'm seeing that these are the items that I need. Looks like at least a billing statement, and then if I already paid, a receipt, and then it looks like there's a link for other supporting documents, should…

39
00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:17.280
P5: I fulfill a certain type of claim. Which I think if I was doing this, I'd probably click that in case

40
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:24.160
P5: what type of claim I am filing for requires a certain supporting document.

41
00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:39.690
P5: Yeah, it looks like it's direct deposit, much like current… Payments for service-related… Payments. And then…

42
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:52.309
P5: Yeah, it looks like there's the get started button, should I want to do that right now? And then I see a couple of links for help, should I encounter any issues.

43
00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:58.949
Moderator: Okay, great. And then, based on this page, what would you do next if you were filing the… your,

44
00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.330
Moderator: filing your first FMP claim today.

45
00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:10.540
P5: Yeah, if I was, I'd probably click this first, just to make sure that I have all the documents that I need, and then I would go to here.

46
00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:11.250
Moderator: Ice.

47
00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:12.020
P5: To get started.

48
00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.349
Moderator: I want to confirm before you get started.

49
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:20.290
Moderator: That makes sense. And then go ahead and click on the Get Started button there.

50
00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.870
P5: Okay.

51
00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:31.410
Moderator: Alright, and then, can, so without going backward, can you state in your own work what the information and alert on the previous page meant to you?

52
00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.769
P5: Sorry, which alert are you talking about?

53
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:47.009
Moderator: that blue screen, so it's just… or… let me rephrase it. Can you state in your own word what the information on the previous screen was?

54
00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:54.150
P5: Oh, yeah, it was basically kind of instructions on how to file a claim, for foreign

55
00:05:54.280 --> 00:06:11.140
P5: For any foreign medical service that I may have received for my service-related disabilities, and then… yeah, just, you know, the things that I need, a link to getting more information for what I need, and then that link that I clicked to get started.

56
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:22.949
Moderator: Okay, and then on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very difficult, and 5 being very easy, what would you rate the clarity of information on that first page you sell?

57
00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.880
P5: I think it was a 5. It seemed pretty straightforward and clear.

58
00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:33.090
Moderator: Okay, so it was pretty… Kind of… Pretty simple for you, then.

59
00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.889
Moderator: Gotcha. And then go ahead and click on the continue to the next task.

60
00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.390
P5: Action…

61
00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:49.719
Moderator: And then on this page, again, it will be similar to what you've just done, where you take a few minutes just to go through this while you're…

62
00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:51.699
Moderator: Reading out loud.

63
00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:52.800
P5: Yeah.

64
00:06:54.780 --> 00:07:01.719
P5: So this looks like how to set up the direct deposit for what was discussed in the previous…

65
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:10.800
P5: page, it looks like if I already have a direct deposit set up, then that can just be used, and then I can skip ahead.

66
00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:31.110
P5: And then this is how to do it if I don't have it already set up, and looks like this is the information that I need. And then this is kind of… this is the sign-in link, I'm understanding, from Step 1, so if I already have direct deposit, I can sign in here, and then I'm assuming that that'll connect the information.

67
00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:36.620
P5: And then after that, it looks like… Let's see…

68
00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:43.669
P5: Okay, so I'll select this button in…

69
00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:50.249
P5: whatever homepage I go to, and then there's these sections that I'll have to finish.

70
00:07:52.530 --> 00:08:04.610
P5: I guess, additional information on top of whatever is provided from the direct deposit information, and then afterwards, I'll get a chance to review my information and select Finish.

71
00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:11.500
Moderator: Okay, and then, what is your impression of this page and your understanding of the content here so far?

72
00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:19.159
P5: I think it's… mostly clear. I think what is confusing is…

73
00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:27.160
P5: this, like, I wasn't… I still don't fully understand what the customer engagement portal is going to be.

74
00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:33.340
Moderator: And then, for yourself, you would want, kind of, like, an expansion, or an…

75
00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:36.830
Moderator: Or some kind of additional explanation on this, then?

76
00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:45.829
P5: Yeah, yeah, just clarification on… when or where I'm gonna be accessing the homepage in 4?

77
00:08:46.679 --> 00:08:47.549
P5: Yeah.

78
00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:57.900
Moderator: And then, in your own words, can you state, like, the process, and in what order would you do to set up direct deposit for a…

79
00:08:58.170 --> 00:08:59.150
Moderator: For this?

80
00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:04.179
P5: Yeah, I… Let's see…

81
00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:14.570
P5: I already know I do have direct deposit set up, so… I would skip ahead to step 3, as it said here.

82
00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:18.589
P5: Okay, it looks like… okay, so this is the…

83
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:25.709
P5: Customer Engagement Portal, the Financial Services Center. Okay, so yeah, I would sign in here, and then…

84
00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:30.590
P5: I would complete this form, Which…

85
00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:38.940
P5: is this portal. I think if you guys, had the same exact wording, it would be less confusing, because

86
00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:46.799
P5: Yeah, I, for some reason, kind of lost track that this is talking about the same thing. But yeah, I would sign in, and then…

87
00:09:47.860 --> 00:10:00.860
P5: hopefully all of my information goes through okay when I use my ID.me account, and then I would expect to see these five sections that I would have to fill out again, and then I would

88
00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:02.530
P5: Select finish.

89
00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:04.490
Moderator: Okay.

90
00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:18.440
Moderator: That was very helpful, thank you for that. Now, Sam is before, on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very difficult, and 5 being very easy, what would you rate the instruction, on this?

91
00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:28.970
P5: I don't know if I'm allowed to do half, but I'd do, like, a four and a half. If not, I'd do a 4. I think it's just… this… this just tripped me up a little,

92
00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:32.630
P5: I almost think it'd be helpful if…

93
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:38.329
P5: the Financial Services Center was repeated, or if you just kept

94
00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:41.590
P5: Like, this… or put, like, a…

95
00:10:41.870 --> 00:11:06.719
P5: what is it, parentheses, FSC, right here, just to make sure, like, this ties to this, and then that ties to that, because they're all kind of different right now. So, it's a little bit confusing. But other than that, I mean, everything seems really clear, and the steps are very clear as well, especially here. I mean, it clearly outlines, if you're already set up, just skip this, go to step 3, and then clearly outlines what extra information you're gonna need to provide

96
00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:09.130
P5: Even if you are set up.

97
00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:23.359
Moderator: Gotcha. And then, can you clarify your, the part where you talk about the ID me? How… what is your expectation around that if you already have an account when you click there?

98
00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:34.040
P5: Based off of my previous sign-ins to ID.me, I'd kind of just expect the same, like, sign-in screen, and then…

99
00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:50.620
P5: Yeah, I guess depending on, like, the interface, I would either expect everything to automatically load, or… and then just a couple of pages turn, and it all just goes accordingly, or maybe there's, like, a few

100
00:11:50.620 --> 00:12:04.089
P5: buttons or clarifying information that I would need to submit, but yeah, if I… I think for me, as someone who already has it set up, I would expect this to be kind of like an easy step, or a quick step, yeah.

101
00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:10.010
Moderator: So you, you're expecting it to be, like, a more personalized experience because you already have an account?

102
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:13.130
Moderator: Gotcha. Thank you for that.

103
00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:17.980
Moderator: And then… You can go ahead and move to the next page down here.

104
00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:22.510
P5: Oh, is it…

105
00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:24.649
Moderator: This actually click anywhere.

106
00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:25.350
P5: Okay.

107
00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.780
Moderator: On the… sorry, within that…

108
00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:31.060
P5: There you go. Oh, okay.

109
00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:39.519
Moderator: So I believe you mentioned that you have disability compensation, and then through direct deposit, is that correct?

110
00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.089
P5: Yes, that's correct.

111
00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:59.529
Moderator: Okay, so now that you have seen both the FMP and then, basically now that you've seen how to set up both the direct deposit for FMP, and what you know about your VA disability compensation setup, do you think the process would be the same or different?

112
00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:06.369
P5: I would think it would be the same. Yeah, just a direct deposit into the account that I have set up.

113
00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:10.300
Moderator: I gotcha. So you expect it at the same process.

114
00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:15.089
Moderator: And then, would you need to do anything different for the FMP claim?

115
00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:20.010
P5: Versus what I already have set up.

116
00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:20.810
Moderator: Correct.

117
00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:24.610
P5: No, I wouldn't expect anything different.

118
00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:25.590
Moderator: Okay.

119
00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:31.820
Moderator: And then, we can move on to the next question here.

120
00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:57.019
Moderator: So, oh, sorry. I thought it didn't move. So, for the next portion, basically, we are gonna go back to the form for filing the claim. Imagine that you already navigated, like, a good portion of the way through the form. You already confirmed your basic information.

121
00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:02.319
Moderator: So it's gonna take you to, like, half, to more than, like, a halfway point through the form.

122
00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:03.880
Moderator: And then…

123
00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:16.109
Moderator: What you're gonna do is you're gonna basically navigate through the rest of the form here, and then, like before, talk out loud as you're doing this, and then go ahead and click continue.

124
00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:17.150
P5: Okay.

125
00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:24.500
P5: Okay, cool, so it looks like I'm…

126
00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:28.870
P5: Almost at the end of the process,

127
00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:36.699
P5: Let's see… so it's asking me who the payments are gonna go to… go to.

128
00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:52.629
P5: Okay, yeah, it's telling me if I've already paid the provider who provided me the service, then just to select the veteran myself, and then if I haven't paid already, then it would be the provider, so that the money can just go directly to the provider.

129
00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:56.680
P5: Yeah, I guess that's all of it.

130
00:14:56.850 --> 00:15:02.579
Moderator: Okay, so in your own word, can you explain to me what this section is asking you to do?

131
00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:12.779
P5: Yeah, it's asking me to select who to send the money to, yeah, just, I guess, depending on whether or not I have already paid for the service that was provided.

132
00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:16.580
Moderator: Okay, and then is anything unclear for you here?

133
00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:18.900
P5: No, I think this is pretty clear.

134
00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:20.139
Moderator: I gotcha.

135
00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:25.140
Moderator: And then I think for this one, you'll have to select the veteran, option.

136
00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:25.820
P5: Okay.

137
00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:30.210
Moderator: And then go ahead and click continue.

138
00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:40.430
Moderator: Same thing as before, kind of go, you know, read out loud, go through this, and explain your thought process.

139
00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:56.169
P5: Okay, yeah, so since I clicked on veteran, which meant that I already paid the provider, since the money is going to be going to me, it seems like, it's just asking for more documents, and proof, so…

140
00:15:56.670 --> 00:16:04.830
P5: Yeah, there's a request for a receipt or a billing statement that says paid. These are the things that it needs to include.

141
00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:07.470
P5: This is telling me…

142
00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:23.389
P5: what supporting documents I'll need for certain claims, and then these are the claims that are listed, and then I guess if I follow under any of these, I would click here to figure out which additional documents I need.

143
00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:32.709
P5: And then, yeah, it just looks like this is where I would upload from, either dragging a file or selecting, and then I would just click continue.

144
00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:37.039
Moderator: Okay, and then is there anything unclear for you on this page here?

145
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:40.250
P5: No, I think this page is also very clear.

146
00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:41.360
Moderator: I gotcha.

147
00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:44.809
Moderator: And then go ahead and click on the, upload button.

148
00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.699
Moderator: Or click in the upload, I believe, yeah.

149
00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:48.280
P5: Okay.

150
00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:52.050
Moderator: So, we just pretended that if you…

151
00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:55.239
P5: Cut some upload, files in here.

152
00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:59.379
Moderator: Gotcha. And then you can continue.

153
00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:00.680
P5: Okay…

154
00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:07.189
P5: Did you want me to do the same thing?

155
00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:08.390
Moderator: Yes, please.

156
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:12.069
P5: Okay, gotcha, yeah. I…

157
00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:18.350
P5: Let's just see… okay, yeah. I personally just like to check everything, so I would click expand all,

158
00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:23.260
P5: Oh, I guess that doesn't work in this demo, so I guess I'll just… Do each of these.

159
00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:35.649
P5: I'm just gonna assume everything is correct here, so… yeah, I'd probably just go through everything to make sure it looks good.

160
00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:43.460
P5: I'm not sure if… Is this meant to be…

161
00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:45.870
P5: Is mailing address meant to be under…

162
00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:50.290
Moderator: That's probably a quirkiness of the, okay.

163
00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:53.370
P5: Gotcha, yeah, I figured the mailing address wouldn't be repeated.

164
00:17:54.450 --> 00:18:01.920
P5: Twice, three times, but okay, yeah, I'm just gonna assume everything here is… Correct.

165
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:12.260
P5: Let's see… Yeah, okay, so then it looks like there is the option to go back,

166
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.610
P5: to select a different payment option.

167
00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:22.609
P5: I think based off the interface I had.

168
00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:33.880
P5: so far, the only options that were presented were either paying to me or paying to the provider, so I'm gonna assume if I click this, it's because I…

169
00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:35.140
P5: M…

170
00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:46.969
P5: wanting, or I realize that I'm not supposed to pay it to whoever I selected. So that's kind of what I would expect if I… if I clicked this. Like, that would be the options that I would lean back to.

171
00:18:47.040 --> 00:19:03.730
P5: Yeah, and then I see that they're supporting files, so I probably just double-check that everything there is good to go. Once I… yeah, read through everything again, double-checked everything, I would… yeah, type all this out, click this, and then press submit.

172
00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:10.190
Moderator: Okay, so everything has been pretty straightforward and kind of as you expected so far.

173
00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:16.690
P5: Yeah, I think maybe the only thing would be… Let's see…

174
00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:18.839
P5: I think it'd be helpful if…

175
00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:22.199
P5: Oh, sorry, okay, I'm understanding now.

176
00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:24.060
P5: Veteran mailing address.

177
00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:28.960
P5: Okay, nevermind, sorry, yeah, I'm understanding that this is… I guess…

178
00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:34.349
P5: Meaning that it'll come to me via mail instead of a direct deposit.

179
00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:44.200
Moderator: Is that confusing to you a little bit there? Or do you… you want some, like, a different way to clarify that up?

180
00:19:44.620 --> 00:20:00.460
P5: No, I think it's just because I didn't go through the entire thing, so yeah, like, we never had a step where I was picking out, like, which method of payment that I wanted for me, so I think that's why. I think otherwise it would have been pretty clear.

181
00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:06.400
Moderator: Gotcha. Thank you for that. That's very useful to under… or helpful to understand.

182
00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:09.720
Moderator: And then, go ahead and continue here.

183
00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:12.839
P5: Can I just click submit?

184
00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:13.739
Moderator: Yeah, you can.

185
00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:14.390
P5: Okay.

186
00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:29.799
Moderator: Okay, so you are at this confirmation page here. Now, this is the page where if you submitted your FMP online claim, can you explain to me your understanding of what happens next and any action you need to take here?

187
00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:36.830
P5: Yeah, it looks like it'll take about 90 days to process, as outlined.

188
00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:40.450
P5: If anything more is needed, I'll be contacted.

189
00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:45.010
P5: Let's see… Yeah, if I…

190
00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:54.820
P5: clicked veteran, it'll be a direct deposit to my bank account, and the provider, it will just be sent directly to them. This is what would…

191
00:20:55.130 --> 00:21:01.969
P5: happen if it's not approved, I can appeal within one year, and then looks like I would have to mail

192
00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:15.850
P5: a letter to request that with any additional information. Here are some options to contact, and then… yeah, me personally, I'd probably just download a copy and print this page just to have it for myself.

193
00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:19.699
Moderator: Okay, so you would do both options, print and download.

194
00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:20.430
P5: Yes.

195
00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:33.400
Moderator: Gotcha. And then, what is your confident rating, if 1 being very low and 5 being very high, that your direct deposit, correctly sets up based on this prototype and this page here?

196
00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:37.890
P5: Is that with the assumption that everything's approved?

197
00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:38.910
Moderator: Yes.

198
00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:48.559
P5: Okay, yeah, then it would be a 5. Like, I've never had any issues with a VA direct deposit, so yeah, would not be expecting anything crazy.

199
00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:53.420
Moderator: Okay, so like, like before, everything is running as you expected.

200
00:21:54.740 --> 00:22:00.240
Moderator: And then, is there anything about the direct deposit that would make you not want to file your claim online?

201
00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:02.779
P5: No, I don't think so.

202
00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:04.550
Moderator: Okay.

203
00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:10.910
Moderator: So, your experience has been pretty… I guess… smooth.

204
00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:17.369
P5: Yes, yeah, I've never had any issues, so… yeah, a lot of confidence and faith on my end.

205
00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:24.430
Moderator: Oh, gotcha. And then, thank you for that. You can stop, screen sharing. I do have additional questions for you.

206
00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:33.620
P5: Okay, gotcha. Can I just make one request? I realized just now that, like, I didn't use, like, a clean browser. Can I just have all of the top part blocked out as well?

207
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.290
P5: Yeah. This is shared.

208
00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:37.170
Moderator: Yeah, if this is shared, of course.

209
00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:38.590
P5: Yeah, okay, thank you.

210
00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:40.070
Moderator: Make a note of that, alright.

211
00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:49.349
Moderator: And then, so for the next portion is, what is your understanding on how direct deposit,

212
00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:57.159
Moderator: on the direct deposit, process for FMP flow works now that you have gone through this prototype?

213
00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:02.060
P5: Yeah, I'm recalling that…

214
00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:15.339
P5: let's see what steps we took. I think, yeah, first it was just an overview of what information that I would need, and then, yeah, I think there was…

215
00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:30.510
P5: I'm forgetting which step it was, but at some point, I need to figure out whether… there are different steps depending whether or not… or sorry, there's a different option depending on whether or not I paid, or the provider was… or I still haven't…

216
00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:47.849
P5: or the provider still hasn't gotten paid, excuse me. And then also, there were a couple of, different steps, depending on whether or not direct deposit was already set up, which, in my case, it was. So, yeah, it seemed like the whole process, should I need to file for…

217
00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:55.080
P5: A foreign medical provider claim would be pretty simple and straightforward.

218
00:23:55.080 --> 00:24:00.349
Moderator: Okay. And then, what's the one thing that you would change to make this process better for you?

219
00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:16.820
P5: Yeah, I think, just kind of what I had mentioned earlier, a little bit of more consistency on how I think it was the… the customer support portal, or, yeah, customer support portal, that's how it was labeled. I think just making it…

220
00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:29.470
P5: Yeah, the same abbreviations or labeling across those three sections would be helpful, just to understand that that's what's being talked about for all of those spots.

221
00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:34.800
Moderator: Gotcha, so more like the consistent content across the VA.

222
00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:39.080
Moderator: And then, think about the…

223
00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:48.600
Moderator: Sorry. Think about having to contact the VA to set up direct deposit for FMP. What is your thought on that extra step?

224
00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:53.420
P5: It looked like it would be…

225
00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:59.949
P5: straightforward. I mean, I do remember that there were a couple of options to reach out should I need help.

226
00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:01.870
P5: I also…

227
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:12.090
P5: I think when I initially set up direct deposit, it was very easy and very straightforward, so I think even if I had to do it now, or had to do it again, I would expect it to be…

228
00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:16.800
P5: Pretty… pretty, yeah. No issues, basically.

229
00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:27.970
Moderator: I gotcha. So, for you, it has been, kind of smooth sailing. I'm curious if there's anything about, like, the direct deposit that would make you not want to file your claim online.

230
00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:38.929
P5: I think if I had experiences where, you know, the right amount didn't come through, or just didn't come through on the right date, I definitely would be hesitant and would not want to.

231
00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:43.310
Moderator: Okay, I gotcha. So it's more on the reimbursement side of things.

232
00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:51.629
Moderator: And then, what would make you confident that your reimbursement would actually get to your bank account once you file?

233
00:25:54.950 --> 00:26:00.910
P5: Are you asking as if I had never had a direct deposit before, or based off of my experiences?

234
00:26:00.910 --> 00:26:12.170
Moderator: So, based off of your experience so far, like, what would make you really confident that, the reimbursement would make it to your bank account?

235
00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:31.369
P5: Yeah, I mean, as I mentioned, I think just based off my experiences, it's always come in on the right date, the right amount, so I would not expect any trouble with, yeah, a direct deposit coming through from the VA for something like this, if I had filled out all my information correctly.

236
00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:41.960
Moderator: I gotcha, so that's your crux right there. If you feel that you filled out all your information correctly, then you expect your, your reimbursement to go through your… come through your bank.

237
00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:46.450
P5: Yes, and also if it's been approved. Yeah.

238
00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:55.360
Moderator: Gotcha. Alright, that makes sense. And then, do you have any kind of additional feedback for the content we went over today?

239
00:26:56.280 --> 00:27:04.640
P5: Yeah, I think overall it was pretty straightforward and seemed really clear, so yeah, I don't think that there was anything super confusing.

240
00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:08.370
Moderator: Okay, and then do you have any questions for me?

241
00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:10.970
P5: No, I have no questions.

242
00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:18.789
Moderator: Okay, great. I want to circle back and reconfirm that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session.

243
00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:20.809
Moderator: With our partner?

244
00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:26.250
P5: Yes, with the requested information blocked out, please.

245
00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:29.579
Moderator: Right, that makes sense. I'll put a note in here.

246
00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:37.349
Moderator: And then, like I said, what would we do, remove all that information, anyways, but,

247
00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:40.739
Moderator: I believe that is it, and then…

248
00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:44.230
Moderator: Was… besides the information on your…

249
00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:49.180
Moderator: On your browser, was there any part of the discussion that you don't want shared?

250
00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:51.190
P5: No, I don't think so.

251
00:27:51.190 --> 00:28:01.429
Moderator: Okay, thank you. So, I think that's it, so for the closing, I just want to say we really appreciate you taking your time to share your thoughts with us today.

252
00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:21.140
Moderator: Your feedback will be helpful to us in helping us kind of continue developing the site and making it work for all veterans. And then lastly, Perigin will be sending you, like, a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other veterans that you may know to provide you, to provide them with a chance to

253
00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:27.230
Moderator: participate in future, studies like this. Thank you again, and enjoy the rest of your day.

254
00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:29.430
P5: Thank you, you as well.

255
00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:30.100
Moderator: Alright.

256
00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:31.510
P5: Bye.

257
00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:32.220
Moderator: Bye.
