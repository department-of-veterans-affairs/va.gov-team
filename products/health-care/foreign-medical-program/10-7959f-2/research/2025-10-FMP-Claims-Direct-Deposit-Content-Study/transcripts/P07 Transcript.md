00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:09.010
Moderator: I have started recording. I'd like to confirm that you are comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today.

2
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:09.940
P7: Yes.

3
00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:22.049
Moderator: All right, and then, are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip of our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?

4
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.340
P7: Yes.

5
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:31.179
Moderator: Alright, thank you. So, before we get started on the prototype, I do have a few warm-up questions.

6
00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:32.040
P7: Okay.

7
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.230
Moderator: Do you have a service-connected disability at VA?

8
00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.270
P7: I do.

9
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.679
Moderator: And then, do you mind sharing what the disability rating is?

10
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.600
P7: It's 100%.

11
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.680
Moderator: Okay, and then do you receive a direct deposit for your monthly compensation payment?

12
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.700
P7: I do.

13
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.200
Moderator: Alrighty. And then, have you ever heard of a foreign medical program through the VA before?

14
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.380
P7: I have.

15
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.250
Moderator: And, are you registered?

16
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:02.700
P7: I am.

17
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.939
Moderator: Oh, okay. And then, can you describe what it is in your own word?

18
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.600
P7: So, if I have, if I'm outside the country.

19
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:29.189
P7: away from the, you know, the VA facility, the VA medical facility, then I can go see a local provider for any of those service-connected conditions, and then I can get reimbursed for those conditions for which I'm already service-connected.

20
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.280
Moderator: Okay, and then have you filed a reimbursement claim before?

21
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.459
P7: I have.

22
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.830
Moderator: Oh, okay, so you're very familiar with this.

23
00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.419
P7: I, I, yes, I am.

24
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.409
Moderator: Are you using a mobile device or a desktop computer today?

25
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.020
P7: I'm a desktop.

26
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.540
Moderator: Okay, desktop.

27
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:59.989
Moderator: Well, a laptop, I guess. Yeah, laptop. So for this one, then, I will give you a kind of a desktop prototype. Give me a few seconds before I give you the link here.

28
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.009
Moderator: Once I give you the link, you can click on it.

29
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:12.380
P7: Okay.

30
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.680
Moderator: Once it opens, you can…

31
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.329
Moderator: Screen share, so we can go through that together.

32
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.079
P7: Okay, then I will screen share here… let's see…

33
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.769
Moderator: It might take a little bit of time for everything to load up.

34
00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.850
Moderator: Alright, I do see it.

35
00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.090
Moderator: Huh? So please take a few minutes to kind of look over this page, and…

36
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.590
P7: Okay.

37
00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.320
Moderator: Think out loud as you're going through this.

38
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:08.510
P7: Okay.

39
00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.800
P7: Seems like the, it's very familiar to the VA.gov

40
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.990
P7: Other pages, seems like it's very, you know.

41
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.700
P7: Well put together, looks like it's got…

42
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.380
P7: You know, highlighted information, easy to identify.

43
00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:39.579
P7: with what's kind of the, you know, the main points here. Identifying, like, the bullets is very easy to, to understand.

44
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:48.859
Moderator: And then, based on this page, what would you do next if you were filling your first FMP claim today?

45
00:03:49.740 --> 00:04:03.390
P7: So I think I would, you know, knowing that this information here in the middle about, you know, kind of what I need to prepare before I fill out the form, and kind of look at this to make sure I had all that information available.

46
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:22.069
P7: I'm always, you know, looking for that extra layer of information, so I see that there looks to be some sort of link here that would, you know, allow me to see extra information, so I would be prone to click here in this supporting documents

47
00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:32.679
P7: what looks like a link, and then I would, you know, make notes of what documents do I need to prepare before I would to fill out, you know, the form.

48
00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:42.540
P7: And then I think I would, you know, follow the instructions to make sure I had a direct deposit set up, to make sure that I'm ready to

49
00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.260
P7: To get started.

50
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.889
P7: Okay, that makes sense.

51
00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.040
Moderator: Very thorough. Thank you for that.

52
00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.849
Moderator: And then, for the next portion, can you click on the Get Started?

53
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.790
P7: Right?

54
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:54.460
Moderator: Yes.

55
00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.910
Moderator: You might have to click it again. There it is.

56
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:10.339
Moderator: So this is just a pause screen here. Can you state in your own word what information and alert on the previous page meant?

57
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.050
P7: I'm sorry, can you say that again?

58
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.700
Moderator: Can you state in your own word what the previous information…

59
00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.190
P7: previous page meant.

60
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:31.549
P7: So it kind of was an introduction to the program, kind of gave me some instructions on what I needed to prepare for, and then how to establish a direct deposit.

61
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.609
P7: And with, you know, with an option to go ahead and get started then.

62
00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.650
P7: Okay.

63
00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:47.079
Moderator: And then, on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very difficult, and 5 being very easy, what would you rate the clarity of information on that page?

64
00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.230
P7: 5…

65
00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:53.880
Moderator: Can you elaborate on that?

66
00:05:54.070 --> 00:06:13.550
P7: So, you know, someone who is, used to using, you know, online resources to research, finding things that were well-spaced apart, bold print, bullet points, made it very easy for me to find those key points

67
00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:21.339
P7: For… for me to identify what is… what is needed to be able to get that information.

68
00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:28.189
Moderator: Thank you. And then you can click on the continue to next task.

69
00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:28.950
P7: Okay.

70
00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:36.380
Moderator: And then, same thing like before, where, take a few minutes just to go through this, and then please think out loud.

71
00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:37.380
P7: Okay.

72
00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:55.460
P7: So, you know, again, I think it's, you know, it's laid out well. The bold print, you know, kind of gets my attention to looking at, you know, what do I need to do? And then, of course, I'm… personally, I'm drawn to this

73
00:06:56.030 --> 00:07:02.199
P7: You know, to a link to try and see what, you know, what else is there for me to find out.

74
00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:09.719
P7: I like the, you know, the numbers, 1, 2, 3, 4, kind of easy to follow, you know.

75
00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:14.779
P7: Ways to kind of guide you through the process of what you need to do first.

76
00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:21.220
P7: What you need to do next, and then clearly, you know, it kind of tells you what you need to roll through.

77
00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:25.880
P7: So, pretty, pretty easy to identify what's, what's here.

78
00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:26.850
Moderator: Okay.

79
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:36.769
Moderator: And then, can you state in your own words the process in what… and in what order you would do to set up the direct deposit for FMP claim?

80
00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:48.520
P7: So, I think you're, you know, identifying what, what resource, or what bank you're gonna use, and then you're going to,

81
00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:52.770
P7: You know, fill out all the documentation, and then…

82
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:58.760
P7: Be able to, you know, turn it all in to make sure that your

83
00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:05.099
P7: Your direct deposit is established, before you were to file a claim.

84
00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:15.810
Moderator: Okay, and then, same as before, on a scale of a 1 to 5, 1 being very difficult and 5 being very easy, what would you rate the instruction?

85
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.709
Moderator: On this page here.

86
00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:28.170
P7: Again, I think I'd have to go with that 5. Again, it's very clear, easy to follow, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. It's… seems like it's,

87
00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:29.909
P7: Been well thought out.

88
00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:37.119
P7: you know, to… Where do you start, and what's the steps in between to get to that finish line?

89
00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:37.600
Moderator: Right.

90
00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:43.649
Moderator: And then, would you call anything on this page that's being especially helpful or confusing to you?

91
00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:58.940
P7: No, I think… I mean, it's obviously, like I mentioned before, I think the bold print and the numeric way that it's established, I think that's very helpful.

92
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:05.280
P7: Anything that's confusing? No, I don't see anything without, you know.

93
00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:15.570
P7: getting, you know, digging into it and reading every word for word, seems like it's very clear, so I don't find anything that seems to be standing out as confusing.

94
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:22.879
Moderator: Alright, thank you for that. And then, I think you can scroll down to the bottom, the link at the bottom should take you to the next

95
00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.880
Moderator: The go-to foreign, yeah, that one.

96
00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:26.570
P7: Okay.

97
00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:35.350
Moderator: Alright, so you mentioned that you receive disability compensation via direct deposit.

98
00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:38.839
Moderator: Now that you've seen both.

99
00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:46.050
P7: set up for the direct deposit for FMP, and what you know about your VA disability compensation setup.

100
00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:49.869
Moderator: Do you, do you think the process would be the same or different?

101
00:09:50.800 --> 00:10:10.319
P7: I think it looks to be the same. I mean, it's been… it's been, you know, many, many years since I've set up my direct deposit for my disability compensation, but from… from memory, it seems like it would be very similar in the fact of, you know, establishing what, you know, what bank you want it to go to, and the documents you need to fill out.

102
00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:11.220
Moderator: Okay.

103
00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:16.379
Moderator: And then, would you need anything different for FMP claim, in your opinion?

104
00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:19.369
P7: To, to establish the direct deposit?

105
00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:20.230
Moderator: Yeah.

106
00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:23.909
P7: I didn't see anything, you know,

107
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:32.160
P7: immediately, other than, you know, like, if I had a foreign bank or something that I would be using, there may be something different there.

108
00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:37.169
P7: For my foreign medical program claims versus my disability.

109
00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:38.370
Moderator: That makes sense.

110
00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:43.840
Moderator: And then you can go ahead and click continue to next task.

111
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:58.079
Moderator: So for this one, we're gonna pretend like you navigate through the form, filled out, information such as your, basic information.

112
00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:08.470
Moderator: that you already filled out your address, your home address, your contact information already, and then we're just gonna jump you towards the end of the form, so go ahead and

113
00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:09.950
Moderator: Click on that.

114
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:23.450
Moderator: And then what we'll do now is we'll navigate through the form here, and again, like you're doing before, where you're, take a few minutes to look at this, and then think out loud.

115
00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:24.730
P7: Okay.

116
00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:30.659
P7: So I recognize, the, you know.

117
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:46.039
P7: graph here, the status bar. I think, you know, in my opinion, that's been helpful for other types of online applications. I think that's, you know, helpful to let folks know how close they are and how they're progressing through.

118
00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:53.500
P7: So, you know, again, I think it lays out how are we, you know, how do you…

119
00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:59.150
P7: Define, where do the payments go to?

120
00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:03.299
P7: Easy to identify the radio button that you would, you know, fill in.

121
00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:08.930
P7: And then… kind of gives you some, you know…

122
00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:15.280
P7: Some identification number here, and that's always a feel-good,

123
00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:19.869
P7: Piece, so you've got some sort of reference to go back to if you have to.

124
00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:23.489
Moderator: Okay, and then anything unclear here?

125
00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:28.849
P7: No. Like I said, it seems like it's all very well laid out.

126
00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:31.170
P7: So, yeah.

127
00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:33.049
Moderator: Alright, we can continue on.

128
00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:35.410
Moderator: That continue button there.

129
00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:36.410
P7: Okay?

130
00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:50.270
P7: Same, same idea, 7?

131
00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:52.109
Moderator: Yeah. Same idea, think out loud.

132
00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:53.410
P7: Okay.

133
00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:05.599
P7: So it looks like it's got some very clear information here. Again, bullet points, so it's easy to, you know, identify what you're…

134
00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:15.740
P7: You know, what information you're putting here, the documents that you need, and then again, there's a resource to find

135
00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:20.000
P7: You know, more information. Looks like what would be a hyperlink.

136
00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:29.950
P7: How to upload the files, and again, this is pretty standard for most, veterans these days who have done any type of online work.

137
00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:32.930
P7: And then…

138
00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:45.430
P7: It's like you can have a chance to either manually upload or, you know, walk through the steps of finding your file, or maybe even just being able to click and drag something.

139
00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:56.229
P7: I've noticed that this, you know, finish the application later option was on the, you know, previous page as well, so that's a benefit to, you know, if you're unable, if you get interrupted or something.

140
00:13:56.410 --> 00:14:02.460
P7: And again, that… I think that ID number is a feel-good piece of…

141
00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:07.010
P7: So it kind of makes us, feel good that we've got a reference number for something.

142
00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:13.149
Moderator: So, a lot of And a lot of features that you're familiar with.

143
00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:22.670
P7: That's correct, and again, I think from, you know, from my own experience working with online applications here, I think it's very helpful to have that,

144
00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:36.280
P7: I guess the… something that looks familiar. It doesn't, you know, it's not alarming when you go here, because again, it looks… it's very similar to other things on VA.gov.

145
00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:48.690
Moderator: That makes sense. Since it's a prototype, we won't be uploading anything. We'll pretend like you upload something, so if you scroll down to the upload there, if you click on that, it will…

146
00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.370
Moderator: Fake an upload.

147
00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:51.360
P7: Okay.

148
00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:55.969
Moderator: And then if you scroll down here again, you'll see that there's a file in there now.

149
00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:56.860
P7: Okay.

150
00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:59.859
Moderator: And then you can continue to the next task here.

151
00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:08.490
Moderator: And same as before, please take a few moments to, kind of, Think out loud here.

152
00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:16.280
P7: Okay? You know, again, I recognize the ability to expand your information.

153
00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:20.840
P7: I'm getting a chance to verify that everything is correct, and again, I think that's the…

154
00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:23.360
P7: You know, the feel-good…

155
00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:34.020
P7: Way to verify that you have, you know, you didn't fat-finger anything, or, you know, make a mistake in putting something together.

156
00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:43.580
P7: So, so that's a… you know, again, that's a very familiar way to have things out here.

157
00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:51.029
P7: See the note here, you know, need to have that, make sure folks understand what, you know, the consequences are.

158
00:15:53.500 --> 00:16:02.220
P7: You know, I got, yep, see that you can put this in, chance to certify that what you're putting there is accurate and true.

159
00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:19.249
P7: So, looks like it's pretty easy to navigate, and it would be a comfortable feeling if I was seeing this for the first time from, you know, what I know about VA.gov, just from, you know, researching and looking at other information.

160
00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:22.370
Moderator: Right, so all very familiar to you here.

161
00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:23.260
P7: Yes.

162
00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:30.989
Moderator: And then, if you're doing this for real, you would be doing the same thing, just going through and kind of reviewing everything before submitting?

163
00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:39.890
P7: Absolutely, yeah, I… I definitely don't want to make a mistake and… and interrupt, the…

164
00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:51.719
P7: the flow of my benefits and things, and so I want to always verify that I didn't fat-finger something or click the wrong, you know, button, so I always take that extra chance to review

165
00:16:51.720 --> 00:17:01.239
P7: an application information, so this information at the top, I would open all of these to verify that everything was still correct.

166
00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:05.640
P7: And then I would, move forward with submitting.

167
00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:08.530
Moderator: Okay, that makes sense.

168
00:17:08.839 --> 00:17:13.590
Moderator: Can you go ahead and move on to the next one by clicking submit?

169
00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:14.479
P7: Okay?

170
00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:27.619
Moderator: Okay, here on this page, you have submitted your FMP claim online. Can you explain to me your understanding of what happens next, and any actions that you might take here?

171
00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:41.280
P7: Okay, so I think after I submit my claim, then it's going to be reviewed, make sure all the documents are correct, it gets processed, and at that point, it would be, you know.

172
00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:47.620
P7: Paid, or it would be, you know, returned for additional information or additional action.

173
00:17:47.930 --> 00:18:05.530
P7: So… but, you know, if I'm looking at this page, I think I'm, you know, I'm looking at the opportunity to print this page. I don't think I would actually print it. I would probably just, you know, screenshot the fact that I've submitted it.

174
00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:12.060
P7: Knowing that I've got this as kind of some confirmation, And then…

175
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:23.759
P7: Okay, yeah, it seems like it's got tons of what your next steps are and what you kind of need to do, and again, it gives you a chance to get some information about what you do if something doesn't work well.

176
00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:26.999
P7: A way to get some information and some help.

177
00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:30.030
P7: And then…

178
00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:37.219
P7: You know, I think it's good to get you that… oops, gotta get you to go back to the VA website.

179
00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:52.000
Moderator: Okay, and then what is your confident rating, 1 being very low, and 5 being very high, that you, have direct deposit correctly set up based on this prototype here?

180
00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:58.220
P7: I probably would say, I mean, without having some sort of…

181
00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:07.279
P7: confirmation that my direct deposit… I didn't… I didn't see that anywhere, that my direct deposit had been verified of some sort.

182
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:18.999
P7: I've seen that I was able to submit my claim, you know, using what information was provided previously, like, I, you know, I turned in everything I needed to. So I would say probably 4.

183
00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:23.369
P7: I'm confident, I'm fairly confident I did everything correctly.

184
00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:38.960
P7: But I, you know, I didn't really see, other than that page where it was, you know, here's my institution, and things, but until it was actually in the bank, I… I would be hesitant to say I'm, you know, a 5 confident level.

185
00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:41.039
P7: I gotcha. And then…

186
00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:50.939
Moderator: I feel like I'm hearing two things here. One is that, obviously, once the money's in the bank, and then the other one is, I think you want, like, some kind of…

187
00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:56.339
Moderator: status on the direct deposit, is that correct?

188
00:19:57.060 --> 00:20:04.159
P7: Maybe it's just something that, you know, that says, you know, hey, this is a real institute.

189
00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:21.429
P7: like a real banking institution, and I don't know if that's possible at all to, you know, verify that, you know, 123 Bank in Anytown, USA, is, is a true and accurate institution. But something that would say, you know.

190
00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:32.840
P7: Yep, hey, you know, we've… we've received your… your direct deposit, notification, and, you know, looks like everything checks out, something.

191
00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:41.469
Moderator: Okay, that makes sense. And then, is there anything about the direct deposit process that would make you not want to file your claim online?

192
00:20:42.680 --> 00:21:00.850
P7: Me? No. Everything I see here, I feel confident that I would be more than willing to submit my claim using this, knowing that direct deposit, you know, and again, feeling confident that I could verify that, what I entered before I hit submit.

193
00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:08.439
P7: Again, and hopefully veterans… other veterans will be as detailed to go in and, you know, check their,

194
00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:11.950
P7: Information that they self-entered before they would hit submit.

195
00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:14.050
Moderator: Right? That makes sense.

196
00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:18.929
Moderator: And thank you for that. I want to say for the next portion, we don't need,

197
00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:22.159
Moderator: You did a screen share, so you can stop sharing there.

198
00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:22.950
P7: Okay.

199
00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:26.559
Moderator: I do have a couple more questions for you here.

200
00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:27.100
P7: Sure.

201
00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:31.259
Moderator: So, what's your understanding on how the direct deposit

202
00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:35.980
Moderator: a process for FMP claim works now that you've gone through this prototype.

203
00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:47.539
P7: So it seems like it's a one and done, just like your VA disability compensation, once you establish it. Unless you make any changes, it would be… it would stay…

204
00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:58.279
P7: the same. So it would be that one and done every subsequent claim, it would be easy just to verify, you know, your direct deposit information hasn't changed.

205
00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:00.999
P7: And then you could just continue on with your claim.

206
00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:02.050
Moderator: Gotcha.

207
00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:06.720
Moderator: And then what would be the one thing you would change to make it better for you?

208
00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:12.399
Moderator: About the… Current direct deposit, kind of process here.

209
00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:32.709
P7: Again, I think short of some sort of verification that you've entered all the right information, and maybe not right information, you've added… you've put all the information, the requested information, you know, you know, some sort of checkmark that, hey, your routing number's put in, your account number's put in, we've got your bank information.

210
00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:40.060
P7: So that way you didn't overlook, a step that might have been necessary to create the direct deposit.

211
00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:41.979
Moderator: Okay, that makes sense.

212
00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:51.370
Moderator: And then, thinking about having to contact the VA to set up the direct deposit for FMP, what's your thought about the extra setup here?

213
00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:59.309
P7: I think it's worth the… I think the juice is worth the squeeze, if you will, in the fact that, you know.

214
00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:16.849
P7: why not use, you know, some sort of technology to be able to do that, versus filling out a form and sending it, or faxing it, or, you know, that kind of thing, I think, or making a phone call. Again, if we can leverage some sort of online self…

215
00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:22.270
P7: service portal to do that. Yeah, I think it's well worth the effort.

216
00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:25.110
Moderator: Thank you for that, that's very helpful feedback.

217
00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:36.350
Moderator: And then, anything about the direct deposit, process that feels confusing, complicated? Or, like, it might cause you not to do it online?

218
00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:47.700
P7: Me, personally, no. I don't see… I didn't see anything in there that would have, caused me to pause and be cautioned about

219
00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:51.169
P7: Establishing a direct deposit.

220
00:23:51.170 --> 00:24:05.359
Moderator: Okay. And then earlier, you mentioned that, you know, you're most confident when you see the money in the bank, obviously, but I'm curious if… what would make you confident that your reimbursement would actually get to your bank account?

221
00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:10.240
Moderator: Like, once you file, so that in-between period.

222
00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:30.429
P7: may… I don't know, maybe I overlooked it, but maybe on that confirmation page, it says your application has been completed and filled out, and we're going to be sending it to this institution, or some sort of confirmation, you know, that just, you know, here, the institution we're going to be sending it to.

223
00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:34.860
P7: Maybe you don't have to put the account or routing number, but just some sort of feel-good

224
00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:44.229
P7: Pop-up or some, you know, thing that would say, you know, yep, we got your claim, we're going to be putting it in this institution.

225
00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:45.939
Moderator: That makes sense to me.

226
00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:50.970
Moderator: And then, do you have any additional feedback for the content we just went through today?

227
00:24:53.180 --> 00:25:05.150
P7: No? I mean, I think it's been a… I think an online portal for claim submission has been a, you know, a desire for a long time for those of us that live overseas.

228
00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:15.319
P7: and use this on the regular, so I think it would be… this is going to be a very helpful way to get things, make things a lot easier.

229
00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:20.910
Moderator: That's good to hear. I am curious where you are located.

230
00:25:20.910 --> 00:25:22.779
P7: So, I live in, South Korea.

231
00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:24.890
Moderator: Okay, okay.

232
00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:32.739
Moderator: I could not tell from, I think, your, your, information that says AT. I was like, I don't think that's a state.

233
00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:36.330
P7: Nope, we live in South Korea, so…

234
00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:39.850
Moderator: Alright, thank you. And then, do you have any questions for me?

235
00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:45.130
P7: Nope, I think that's, like I said, I appreciate the opportunity.

236
00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:53.660
Moderator: Of course. I just want to circle back and reconfirm that you are comfortable if we choose to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners.

237
00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:54.620
P7: Absolutely.

238
00:25:54.620 --> 00:26:00.830
Moderator: Okay, and then just to remind you, if we do choose to do that, we'll remove any identifying information,

239
00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:05.280
Moderator: You know, for the purpose of improving the VA experience, of course.

240
00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:06.010
P7: Okay.

241
00:26:06.010 --> 00:26:21.380
Moderator: And then, I just want to say, you know, thank you for this. We really appreciate you taking your time and sharing your thoughts with us today. Your, feedback's gonna be really helpful for us to continue to improve the, you know, the VA.gov for all veterans.

242
00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:29.019
Moderator: And lastly, Paragene will be sending you, like, a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other veterans.

243
00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:34.519
Moderator: That you may know that will give them the chance to, like, participate in future researches as well.

244
00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:36.680
P7: Okay, great. Well, I appreciate the opportunity.

245
00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:38.630
Moderator: Alright, thank you, - - -. Have a nice day.

246
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:39.980
P7: Okay, see you later.
