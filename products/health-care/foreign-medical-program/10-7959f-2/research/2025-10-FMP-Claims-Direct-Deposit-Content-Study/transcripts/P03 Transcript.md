00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.220
P3: I'm learning the bucket.

2
00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:10.700
Moderator: Okay, I have started the recording, so just to confirm what we just chatted about, are you comfortable if I recorded my screen and audio as we talked today?

3
00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:12.750
P3: Yes, I am.

4
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:20.880
Moderator: Great, thank you. And are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion to share with other VA partners? We'll remove any.

5
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.770
P3: vital information.

6
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.980
Moderator: Okay.

7
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:34.080
Moderator: Okay, before we open up the prototype, we're gonna have a few warm-up questions for you. Do you have a service-connected disability at the VA?

8
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.399
P3: I'll get something?

9
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.510
Moderator: Do you mind sharing what your disability is?

10
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.710
P3: You don't change?

11
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.500
P3: 90%.

12
00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.909
Moderator: Do you receive direct deposit for your monthly costs?

13
00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:50.740
Moderator: Is you? Okay.

14
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:59.000
Moderator: And from the information from Paragene, they said you're registered for the foreign medical program, but you've never used it. Is that accurate?

15
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.140
P3: Yeah.

16
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.730
Moderator: Okay, can you just describe in your own words what the foreign.

17
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:05.119
P3: I don't know.

18
00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:05.629
Moderator: program.

19
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.199
P3: medical coach to you?

20
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:20.390
P3: It's a connection to community-based medical services that are not available through the regional VA Medical Center.

21
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.340
Moderator: Got it, thank you.

22
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:24.060
Moderator: We…

23
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.150
P3: Nope.

24
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:26.750
Moderator: Looks like you're on a mobile device.

25
00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.690
Moderator: Okay.

26
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.459
Moderator: I'm going to share a link in our chat to our.

27
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.880
P3: Prototype.

28
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.469
Moderator: And if you could open that up on your phone…

29
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.719
Moderator: I don't know if you need to close anything out that you need to, but then there should be an option to share.

30
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.160
P3: cut.

31
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.590
Moderator: You have it open. Just let me know if you need any help walking through that.

32
00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.639
P3: There was a link, but it's gone.

33
00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.289
Moderator: Oh, I'll paste it again, and maybe it'll…

34
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.120
Moderator: Jump up where you can grab it. It's in the chat, so maybe it's hidden on the mobile screen.

35
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.410
P3: It looks like it's loading.

36
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.550
P3: Okay, okay.

37
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.310
P3: Looks like it's opening.

38
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:34.480
Moderator: The design prototype might take a minute to load for the first time, but when it is and when it's ready, also in Zoom, you should have, like, kind of a…

39
00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:40.459
Moderator: up arrow share screen, broadcast… I think it says broadcast screen when you're on a mobile device.

40
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.689
Moderator: If you could find that and just share the prototype link with us.

41
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.950
Moderator: Share your screen, I mean.

42
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.619
P3: This is, it's the VA, homepage, it looks like.

43
00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.020
P3: Website.

44
00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.500
P3: Automarker medical program claim.

45
00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.920
P3: Instead of direct deposit?

46
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.369
Moderator: That is our prototype that we want to go over, yeah.

47
00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.030
Moderator: And then back on the Zoom window, it should allow you to…

48
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.189
Moderator: Share that screen so we can see what you're seeing as you're going through it.

49
00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:41.430
P3: Hmm.

50
00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.880
P3: I don't see the option to share other than… Who am I…

51
00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.700
Moderator: Is it…

52
00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:47.620
P3: If I share it.

53
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:48.620
Moderator: screen.

54
00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:56.919
P3: No, it's just the, as if I'm on the VA website. There's a VA sign-in page.

55
00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.120
Moderator: Nope, that's not the right spot. Alright, what mobile device are you on?

56
00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.550
P3: It's good.

57
00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.450
Moderator: Android, iPhone…

58
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:08.110
P3: Enjoy it.

59
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.920
Moderator: my…

60
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.810
P3: Build on content experience.

61
00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.039
Moderator: Should I have to go back to the Zoom, it sounds like you're in the prototype.

62
00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:27.219
Moderator: So kind of back into the Zoom screen, like, where you see me or my picture, there should be some buttons there that have a share button.

63
00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.820
Moderator: Oh.

64
00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.580
Moderator: Something flashed, I thought something was sharing.

65
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.830
P3: Okay, I see a share, okay.

66
00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:54.510
Moderator: There it is, yep.

67
00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.769
P3: No, what am I sharing?

68
00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.610
Moderator: And then it should either let you navigate to

69
00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:08.559
Moderator: the prototype that was opened, and, like, pick just share Safari, or if you're in Safari, or whatever browser.

70
00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.500
Moderator: Or just share your phone, and then open the prototype real quick.

71
00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:42.299
Moderator: Yeah, it may give you an alert if you're on an Android. If not, it just has, like, a share content type of a button, and then you can tap on your screen.

72
00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:54.190
P3: Hey, I'm seeing your picture and my picture, then there's, Ayu and Renata. Yeah.

73
00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:59.230
Moderator: Do you see any other buttons down there where it has, like, the…

74
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.060
Moderator: Chat, or a share, like an up arrow.

75
00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:04.300
Moderator: Or kind of where.

76
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:05.390
P3: the video? Sure.

77
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:06.559
Moderator: Okay, click on that one.

78
00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.439
Moderator: And then it'll probably prompt you.

79
00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:12.330
Moderator: Yep.

80
00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:15.280
P3: macro side.

81
00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.919
P3: Google Drive, Box filter.

82
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.340
P3: Document lived.

83
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:22.789
P3: A whiteboard camera.

84
00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:24.550
P3: Okay.

85
00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:32.890
Moderator: You'd want to find wherever that prototype is open, so it's probably gonna say share, like, a web browser, or open… share the link.

86
00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:34.810
Moderator: Whatever you opened it in.

87
00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:42.659
Moderator: Or just try sharing screen, and that might actually share all of it, and then you can open it up.

88
00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.060
P3: Ice cream.

89
00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:16.300
P3: Nope.

90
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:19.409
Moderator: They're not letting you share, or is it a permission thing?

91
00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:37.880
Moderator: After you tap on the share button, does it say just share screen, and let you select that?

92
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.450
P3: That's one of the options. There's, like, about 15 options, it looks like.

93
00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:47.490
P3: Let's try Spring. Yes.

94
00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:52.730
P3: Okay, now, when we go there, there's a list of all my…

95
00:07:56.370 --> 00:08:02.500
Moderator: It'll share on your phone screen, but then you should be able to just open the prototype, and then that will just share that.

96
00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:11.160
P3: So it's display over other apps.

97
00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:23.210
P3: Interesting.

98
00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:51.280
Moderator: Not working.

99
00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:53.220
P3: Well…

100
00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:59.499
Moderator: We can pivot… you have the link, and you can see it, so… We will just improvise that.

101
00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:07.980
Moderator: Let's see, I'm going to share it on my screen, so then you can kind of…

102
00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:09.769
Moderator: We'll do it that way.

103
00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.299
Moderator: Maybe… where did it go?

104
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:32.500
Moderator: Okay, but you can't see it, so…

105
00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:42.239
Moderator: kind of would like you to go through the prototype and just think aloud as what you're seeing on the first page, and I will share a version…

106
00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:44.949
Moderator: On my screen, if that's helpful.

107
00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:55.900
Moderator: try to make it as big as I can for you on my desktop computer, but…

108
00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:06.609
Moderator: And if it's easier for you to look at your version and just not even look at the screen share in Zoom, that's totally fine too, but…

109
00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:18.310
Moderator: Okay, so just kind of looking over this page, could you just talk through what it means to you, and what you would do next if you were filing your first FMP claim today?

110
00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:27.959
P3: Basically, it just gives you information on how to file for the FMP program claims.

111
00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:33.320
P3: Let's see…

112
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:41.589
P3: Upload an itemized billing statement to support your claim.

113
00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:46.369
P3: If you've already paid a provider, you'll need to provide a receipt.

114
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.909
P3: Or other proof that you paid?

115
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.719
P3: Let's see, find out which supporting documents you need.

116
00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:58.440
P3: And then they're talking about setting up direct deposit.

117
00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.150
P3: for claims.

118
00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:03.600
P3: Through the Financial Services Center.

119
00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:13.820
P3: Let's see… The FSC portal is where you can set up direct deposit for claims.

120
00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:25.460
P3: Either VA benefits may use another portal or system to set up direct deposit. For questions, you can call 877-

121
00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:29.300
P3: 3539791.

122
00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:32.699
P3: And learn how to set up direct deposit.

123
00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.109
P3: Then we're gonna get started.

124
00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:37.830
Moderator: 8.

125
00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:42.259
Moderator: Can you just kind of restate in your own words what the information…

126
00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:46.210
Moderator: An alert means here, and let me know if you need me to scroll around at all.

127
00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:52.199
P3: And, basically, they're just giving you, simple directions as far as

128
00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:59.770
P3: How to get reimbursed for, Claims.

129
00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:07.840
P3: In other words, if I go to see a doctor due to, foreign, medical setting.

130
00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:10.050
P3: Do I have to keep receipt.

131
00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:18.540
P3: Let's submit it. I also submit claims for reimbursement, basically.

132
00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:21.040
P3: Does that sound about right?

133
00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:34.860
Moderator: Yeah, great, thank you. Okay, on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very difficult, and 5 being very easy, how would you rate the information, the clarity of information on that first page?

134
00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:41.119
P3: Now, you said 5 is very easy, 1 is difficult.

135
00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:41.550
Moderator: Yes. Correct.

136
00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:43.919
P3: Correct Okay, bye.

137
00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:46.840
Moderator: Is there a reason why you would rate it that way?

138
00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:50.480
P3: It's very simple, very direct.

139
00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:59.089
P3: It's very similar to… Submitting claims, stateside, there's really not that much difference.

140
00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:00.740
P3: Yeah.

141
00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.810
P3: Just going to a different location.

142
00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:10.019
Moderator: Thank you. Kind of continue on to the next.

143
00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:25.549
Moderator: Again, let me know if I'm scrolling too fast or too slow, or you can use the prototype link that you have, too, and just not share, but just talk through in your own words as you go through this page of what it means to you, and what your impressions are of what you need to do.

144
00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:31.399
P3: Okay, it seems like it's, directions to set up…

145
00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:35.479
P3: Direct deposit payments, or claim reimbursement.

146
00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:43.090
Moderator: Yeah, can you just state in your own words, kind of, about the process?

147
00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:44.880
Moderator: As I'm scrolling through…

148
00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:49.020
P3: First time… You want to determine if you have

149
00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:51.750
P3: Direct deposit already set up or not.

150
00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:54.729
P3: And there's, those screening method for that.

151
00:13:55.990 --> 00:14:00.709
P3: If you need to set it up, then there's directions to set up direct deposit.

152
00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:07.740
P3: What you will need, social security number, your address, bank information.

153
00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:18.149
P3: And then you're gonna sign into the, financial services summary.

154
00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:19.610
P3: Portable.

155
00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:26.380
P3: And use IDME, just like you would for regular VA app login.

156
00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:35.109
P3: If you don't have a VA ID or ID me, they'll teach you how to do that, and they'll walk you through it.

157
00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:44.279
P3: Okay, step 4, complete the VA vendor file form.

158
00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:50.180
P3: It's on the customer engagement homepage.

159
00:14:53.370 --> 00:15:04.380
P3: Okay, and then there's things that you need, 5 sections, your social security number, tax ID number, AE information if you have one.

160
00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:14.299
P3: address, bank information, etc. If you authorize another representative, then you can enter that. It's optional.

161
00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:19.450
P3: And then the fifth section, you're going to review The five of us.

162
00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:21.269
P3: Review and finish.

163
00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:24.760
P3: Yeah.

164
00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:36.830
Moderator: And same as before, can you just restate in your own words, kind of, the overall process and the order that you would do to set up FMP claims?

165
00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:45.790
P3: First, you will determine whether or not you're… you're set up for a direct deposit.

166
00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:48.630
P3: Then they can give you a…

167
00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:58.789
P3: A little checklist to see if you're authorized for that. And then they're going to walk you through setting it up. They tell you what you need.

168
00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:01.490
P3: To set up, direct deposit.

169
00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:03.050
P3: reimbursement.

170
00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:12.240
P3: For me, I'm already established direct deposit, so, that's kind of… kinda redundant for me, you know, it's…

171
00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:14.810
P3: Yeah.

172
00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:17.400
P3: Yeah, I guess would you expect to have to…

173
00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:18.510
Moderator: do anything.

174
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:22.529
Moderator: Would you expect to have to do anything if you were filing a claim for the first time?

175
00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:26.410
P3: Mmm.

176
00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:29.019
P3: No, nothing different for me, no.

177
00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:42.700
P3: Okay. Yeah, because stateside, I filed claims for reimbursement before for travel, so it's pretty much the same thing, it's just overseas now. It's a different portal, but you're doing the same.

178
00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:43.850
P3: Task.

179
00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:45.480
Moderator: Got it.

180
00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:58.339
Moderator: And also, same as before, we're gonna do the rating thing again. On a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being difficult and 5 being very easy. For this specific page, how would you rate the instructions?

181
00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:05.289
P3: I'd say pie, it's pretty simple.

182
00:17:07.089 --> 00:17:14.199
Moderator: Would you call out anything on this page that either makes it especially helpful for you, or confusing?

183
00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:19.339
P3: Helpful, that's part of everything, it's been…

184
00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:27.129
P3: There's… they talk about the 5 different sections, and it's just a matter of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and then you're gonna review.

185
00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:30.069
P3: Before you submit your information.

186
00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:35.889
P3: You know, social security number, tax ID, bank information.

187
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:39.359
P3: It's… it's right here in front of you.

188
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:41.360
P3: Step by step.

189
00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:42.580
Moderator: Great.

190
00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:44.599
P3: For me, it's simple. Very simple.

191
00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:47.970
Moderator: Thank you for that feedback

192
00:17:48.180 --> 00:18:03.049
Moderator: Okay, we have a couple questions here as we kind of pause between the two screens. So, you'd mentioned you already received disability direct deposit for disability compensation, and you wouldn't have to do anything. So now that you've seen FMP,

193
00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:05.799
Moderator: And you've said that's pretty close to travel pay?

194
00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:08.920
Moderator: Would you expect anything different for this process?

195
00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:17.520
P3: Not really. It's just, you know, different paperwork, but still the same thing.

196
00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:24.400
P3: You got your… you have your bill, you have your receipts, those kind of things.

197
00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:27.769
P3: And they're telling you exactly where you're gonna submit it.

198
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:30.540
Moderator: Okay.

199
00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:34.710
Moderator: Thank you, that's helpful feedback. Seems like you're…

200
00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:41.270
Moderator: Kind of used to this drill in other areas, so it's just another… Yeah, yeah.

201
00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:53.479
Moderator: Okay, so now we're gonna imagine you did the first part of the FMP claim cover sheet, so you entered in all of your name, social security. We'll just kind of pretend in our prototype as we go through here.

202
00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:59.570
Moderator: And now you arrive at this page in the form to select payment selection.

203
00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:06.069
Moderator: Now just kind of talk through this page and say what you would do next, or if anything is unclear to you.

204
00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:11.619
P3: Okay, they're asking who they're gonna send the payments to.

205
00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:17.839
P3: I'm assuming I could have it sent to my payee or anyone else if I wanted to.

206
00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:21.010
P3: Again, there… there's a…

207
00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:28.189
P3: required to send payments to the veteran, or to the provider, where they're gonna pay the doctor directly, or…

208
00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:29.920
P3: Whoever else.

209
00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:38.120
Moderator: Is there anything else you would do on this screen here, or anything that's unclear?

210
00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:41.250
P3: Mmm, yeah.

211
00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:47.080
Moderator: Through this one.

212
00:19:47.730 --> 00:20:01.620
Moderator: And again, same on this page, it's a prototype, won't be interacting or uploading anything, but just think aloud as you go through this page, and if anything that stands out, or that you would like extra explanation on, please point it out.

213
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.890
P3: Okay, it looks like they're,

214
00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:07.990
P3: We're going to upload the billing statement.

215
00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:12.299
P3: I guess it would want the receipts, too.

216
00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:14.269
P3: If I paid it.

217
00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:22.889
P3: Additional documents for these type of claims. Inpatient hospital care.

218
00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:27.720
P3: Excuse me.

219
00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:51.160
P3: Yeah, they're very specific as far as what type of files you can, what you can upload.

220
00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:53.450
P3: With your documentation.

221
00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:57.049
P3: And it makes it simple, you know?

222
00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:02.530
P3: Bench.

223
00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:17.060
Moderator: Is there anything else about this page that you would need explanation on, or would you need to do before you were uploading in a real-life scenario?

224
00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:23.000
P3: That's… Fairly simple. Separ explanatory.

225
00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:29.750
Moderator: Upload our pretend file here.

226
00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:38.399
Moderator: And then kind of going through this page as you're getting ready to submit the claim.

227
00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:44.220
Moderator: Is there anything you would do on this page? And just tell me to scroll, or click, or whatever.

228
00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:58.240
P3: Let's see… I'm guessing, we're just… this is just you checking everything, right? Final selection…

229
00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:00.750
P3: Confirming your selections.

230
00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:10.800
P3: These are things that have to be just right in order to get paid and get reimbursed.

231
00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:16.709
P3: And then there's a statement of chip, you're… Names or honest, whatever.

232
00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:21.090
P3: Everything is accurate to the best of my ability.

233
00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:30.610
Moderator: you are doing this in a real-life scenario. Is there anything different you would do on this page at this point?

234
00:22:31.670 --> 00:22:33.790
Moderator: Or any reason to stop?

235
00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:54.169
Moderator: And now we will look at the last page. So, you've submitted the online FMP claim cover sheet. Can you explain to me your understanding of what happens next as you go through this page?

236
00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:57.719
Moderator: If I'm scrolling too fast, just tell me to slow down.

237
00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:00.119
P3: You can't ring it.

238
00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:11.259
P3: Okay, once you submit the claim, you want to print off a copy for your records to confirm that it has been submitted.

239
00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:13.939
P3: That's good, that's good.

240
00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:19.100
P3: 90 days to process your claim.

241
00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:28.650
P3: I've never known them to take that long in the United States. Maybe it's different overseas, but it's never taken that long.

242
00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:36.200
P3: If you're eligible, your deposit will be into your bank account, direct deposit.

243
00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:41.690
P3: Then, if you don't have a direct deposit, they're gonna take you to that step.

244
00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:51.089
P3: You have the choice to pay the provider directly, or you can get reimbursed to yourself, if you've already paid.

245
00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:54.069
P3: Which is normally the case.

246
00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:05.360
P3: And they're gonna pay you in U.S. dollars, regardless of the… Currency.

247
00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:06.930
P3: in the country.

248
00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:11.580
P3: If we don't approve this claim.

249
00:24:12.550 --> 00:24:16.709
Moderator: About that information there, or is there anything missing that you would like to see there?

250
00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:20.100
P3: No.

251
00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:39.370
P3: If you don't approve… if the VA does not approve this claim, there's a, appeal process.

252
00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:43.589
P3: Information, how to go about that.

253
00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:48.950
P3: And, of course, there's an 800 number available as well.

254
00:24:53.930 --> 00:25:02.829
Moderator: If you were filing an FMP claim, for real, based on this page, would you expect to have to take any action or do anything after this?

255
00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:07.040
P3: Mmm, no.

256
00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:12.350
P3: You just wait for a response. You're able to approve what they want.

257
00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:15.490
P3: Yeah, and they say it could take up to 90 days.

258
00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:18.790
P3: In my experience, it's never taken that long.

259
00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:23.270
P3: Of course, I haven't filed While here in the Philippines, so I didn't…

260
00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:26.850
Moderator: Got it.

261
00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:41.440
Moderator: And then, one more rating question. So, what is your confidence, 1 being very low and 5 being very high, that you've set up direct deposit correctly based on this prototype and this page here?

262
00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:46.430
P3: I'm very confident by…

263
00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:56.810
Moderator: Okay, is there anything about this kind of information and process that would make you not want to file your FNP claim online?

264
00:25:58.420 --> 00:25:59.560
P3: No, no.

265
00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:03.550
Moderator: Okay.

266
00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:16.270
Moderator: So I just have a couple kind of wrap-up questions, kind of going through that. What's your understanding of how direct deposit for FMP claims works compared to all the other direct deposits you've dealt with?

267
00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:25.549
P3: Basically, you're gonna submit the claim. There's a checklist of all the information that's required.

268
00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.859
P3: When you submit your claim.

269
00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:37.849
P3: Once you've submitted all the information, you can print off a copy of the receipt that you have submitted the claim.

270
00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:44.450
P3: And then, at that point, the clock begins. You have 90 days for them to either approve or disprove.

271
00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:52.920
P3: If it's not approved, there's information provided to file a claim to appeal the decision, whatever.

272
00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:59.570
P3: To me, it's very supple, very supple.

273
00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:01.770
Moderator: Got it.

274
00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:05.539
Moderator: I'll stop sharing as we wrap up a couple more questions, but…

275
00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:15.579
Moderator: I guess if you had a magic wand and could change one thing about the prototype and all the direct deposit information that you saw today, what would it be, if anything?

276
00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:29.359
P3: I don't see… I don't see anything wrong, but for me, it's straightforward, straight simple, and, you know, everything is step. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

277
00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:32.790
P3: Very simple to me.

278
00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:33.860
Moderator: Okay.

279
00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:39.090
P3: Compared to some… some forms and claims, it's very simple.

280
00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:52.050
Moderator: Got it. And kind of thinking about if you had to contact and call the VA to set up direct deposit for FMP, if that kind of… there was a phone number mentioned in there, if you ran into that snag, what are your thoughts on that step?

281
00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:54.340
Moderator: Do you think you would need to call?

282
00:27:56.010 --> 00:28:03.219
P3: Okay, now, right now, it's very difficult to get to speak to anyone at the VA.

283
00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:08.029
P3: I call… No matter what time of day you call.

284
00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:23.950
P3: you don't get… they used to put you on hold. You might be on hold for a couple hours. But right now, I just go straight, you know, we're not taking calls right now, please call back later. It's… it's nearly impossible to get to speak to someone by phone right now.

285
00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:31.559
P3: So if you can't handle your business online, you're… you're kind of in a bad place. That's my experience.

286
00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:41.370
Moderator: Got it. No, that's very helpful feedback. But you wouldn't think you would need to call for this. You feel like you'd… the information online that you saw today in the prototype would be good enough.

287
00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:44.140
Moderator: You need to call for help. Okay.

288
00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:56.390
Moderator: I don't know if you've… didn't really say anything felt confusing or complicated about the prototype instructions that you saw today, but kind of just one more chance that anything stand out?

289
00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:58.649
Moderator: To you at all throughout the prototype?

290
00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:00.960
P3: No, no.

291
00:29:02.650 --> 00:29:05.810
P3: Very simple, straightforward.

292
00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:06.820
P3: Love me.

293
00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:09.260
P3: My opinion.

294
00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:10.520
Moderator: Okay.

295
00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:15.419
Moderator: I don't know if you have any additional feedback or any questions for me today?

296
00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:26.680
P3: No, my… okay, let me just throw this out there. Here in the Philippines,

297
00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:33.740
P3: there's a lot of services that I was getting stateside that are not available here, okay?

298
00:29:33.970 --> 00:29:45.270
P3: So… the doctors that are on the FMP-approved list, they're not convenient for me, okay?

299
00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:51.879
P3: I mean, it's almost impossible to get an appointment for something, urgent care, for example.

300
00:29:53.390 --> 00:30:02.109
P3: I've gone to see… I think maybe 3 or 4 different, medical providers here in the Philippines.

301
00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:14.390
P3: It's just so much simpler, and then… Nothing as he was… It's not worth… This is not worth…

302
00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:16.770
P3: Filing a claim.

303
00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:24.820
P3: Because the medical services here are so much cheaper. Okay, I can… for example, I had,

304
00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:35.630
P3: X-rays, and I got lost at the… less than… Less than $50, okay.

305
00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:43.039
P3: I couldn't even… I couldn't even walk into a doctor's office for less than $50 in America.

306
00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:46.510
P3: So for me, it wasn't really worth…

307
00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:50.120
P3: doing the whole thing, I just absorbed that myself.

308
00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:53.440
P3: That's the reason I haven't really…

309
00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:56.829
P3: File the complaint, filed a claim.

310
00:30:57.090 --> 00:31:07.159
P3: It's just, the medical providers on that list of approved doctors, they're just not… Accessible to me.

311
00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:13.109
P3: Is that… am I confusing you, or am I just confusing myself? No.

312
00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:18.109
Moderator: It's not confusing, thanks for sharing that. Very important information to pass along. Thank you.

313
00:31:20.270 --> 00:31:28.540
Moderator: Well, if there's nothing else, I just want to circle back and reconfirm if you're comfortable if we decide to share a short video clip of the session today.

314
00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:29.790
Moderator: It's our VA partners?

315
00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:30.530
P3: Hmm.

316
00:31:30.670 --> 00:31:37.019
Moderator: Okay. And, of course, we'll scrub any identifiable information from it, if we do decide to do so, so…

317
00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:51.089
Moderator: Thank you very much, we really appreciate you taking the time to share all of your thoughts with us today and go over the prototype with us. Your feedback's really helpful as we continue to iterate on this and try and really make sure it works and is understandable for all veterans.

318
00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:52.539
Moderator: So, thank you.

319
00:31:52.950 --> 00:32:03.290
Moderator: And then Perigine will be sending you a thank you note, too, to pass along, the ones that recruited you, so if you know anyone else who wants to participate in future studies, they'll send that information along.

320
00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:05.410
P3: Wonderful.

321
00:32:05.410 --> 00:32:08.550
Moderator: Awesome. Well, thank you, and I hope you enjoy the rest of your day.

322
00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:15.359
P3: Well, it's almost over. Hope you enjoy yours. You do. You're in the United States?

323
00:32:15.570 --> 00:32:19.399
Moderator: Yeah, West Coast, so it's morning for me.

324
00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:26.560
P3: It's, what, 11 o'clock here, so what's your… 9? 8, you're about 8?

325
00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:27.509
Moderator: 7 AM.

326
00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:31.590
P3: Yeah. Yep. West, west coast, really.

327
00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:32.260
Moderator: Yes.

328
00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:32.950
P3: Okay.

329
00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:36.170
Moderator: Awesome, thank you, have a great day!

330
00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:38.580
P3: Thank you, thanks, Jessica. Bye.

331
00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:39.210
Moderator: Bye.
