# Research Design
methodology: "semi-structured interviews with a Figma prototype"
research_format: 
  location: remote 
  moderated: true 
  
# Research Goals & Questions
research_goals:
  - goal_1: "Understand perceived content comprehension for the topic of direct deposit specifically for FMP claims."
  - goal_2: "Discover, if any, of the direct deposit content is confusing or misunderstood by the Veteran and could be a potential risk."
  - goal_3: "Gain insight into any improvements or recommendations to increase clarity of the direct deposit content for FMP claims."

research_questions:
  - "How do Veterans react to the direct deposit informational alert on the introduction page?"
  - "Do Veterans most often click to the static page to 'learn how to setup' or do they stay in the form flow?"
  - "Do Veterans confuse or quickly assume that their bank account information for FMP is the same as what they use for disability compensation?"
  - "Do Veterans express frustration about the separate direct deposit setup process for FMP claims and if so, what is their biggest pain point?"
  - "Do any Veterans say the direct deposit process mentioned in the content would be a blocker for them in filing online?"

hypotheses:
  - "There will be some but minimal confusion about direct deposit being a separate process than what is used for VA Benefits."
  - "Most Veterans will not have an issue with the one-time setup instructions directed to FSC, but may comment on it being inconvenient."

expected_outcomes: "Better understand risks with content comprehension around direct deposit content and instructions within FMP claims."

## Research Goals 🥅	

### Goals

1. Understand perceived content comprehension for the topic of direct deposit specifically for FMP claims.

2. Discover, if any, of the direct deposit content is confusing or misunderstood by the Veteran and could be a potential risk.

3. Gain insight into any improvements or recommendations to increase clairity of the direct deposit content for FMP claims.
  
### Outcome

---

This research will gauge the risk of new direct deposit content on the FMP Registration form and a static page on VA.gov - so that it is not introducing confusion for Veterans or an increase in calls/processing work.

---

### Research questions	

1. How do Veterans react to the direct deposit informational alert on the introduction page?

2. Do Veterans most often click to the static page to "learn how to setup" or do they stay in the form flow?

3. Do Veterans confuse or quickly assume that their bank account information for FMP is the same as what they use for disability compensation?

4. Do Veterans express frustration about the separate direct deposit setup process for FMP claims and if so, what is their biggest pain point?

5. Do any Veterans say the direct deposit process mentioned in the content would be a blocker for them in filing online?


### Hypotheses
 
---

- We assume that overall there will be some but minimal confusion about direct deposit being a separate process than what is used for VA Benefits.
- Most Veterans will not have an issue with the one-time setup instructions directed to FSC, but may comment on it being incovenient.
