team: "Health Apps UX Team"
product: "Foreign Medical Program - Claims"
product_area: "authenticated"

# Background Context
background:
  problem_statement: "Adding direct deposit content around Foreign Medical Program Claims that does not introduce confusion or misunderstanding from the Veteran about set up because it is a different process than other VA benefits."
  product_location: "Health care benefits hub"
  user_familiarity: "New online form, testing new content additions"
  product_brief_url: "https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/foreign-medical-program/10-7959f-2/product-outline.md"

# Research Design
methodology: "semi-structured interviews with a Figma prototype"
research_format: 
  location: remote 
  moderated: true 
  
# Research Goals & Questions
research_goals:
  - goal_1: "Understand perceived content comprehension for the topic of direct deposit specifically for FMP claims."
  - goal_2: "Discover, if any, of the direct deposit content is confusing or misunderstood by the Veteran and could be a potential risk."
  - goal_3: "Gain insight into any improvements or recommendations to increase clarity of the direct deposit content for FMP claims."

research_questions:
  - "How do Veterans react to the direct deposit informational alert on the introduction page?"
  - "Do Veterans most often click to the static page to 'learn how to setup' or do they stay in the form flow?"
  - "Do Veterans confuse or quickly assume that their bank account information for FMP is the same as what they use for disability compensation?"
  - "Do Veterans express frustration about the separate direct deposit setup process for FMP claims and if so, what is their biggest pain point?"
  - "Do any Veterans say the direct deposit process mentioned in the content would be a blocker for them in filing online?"

hypotheses:
  - "There will be some but minimal confusion about direct deposit being a separate process than what is used for VA Benefits."
  - "Most Veterans will not have an issue with the one-time setup instructions directed to FSC, but may comment on it being inconvenient."

expected_outcomes: "Better understand risks with content comprehension around direct deposit content and instructions within FMP claims."

## Research Goals ü•Ö	
`What are you trying to learn from this research?` 

### Goals

`1.` **[Understand perceived content comprehension for the topic of direct deposit specifically for FMP claims.]**

`2.` **[Discover, if any, of the direct deposit content is confusing or misunderstood by the Veteran and could be a potential risk.]**

`3.` **[Gain insight into any improvements or recommendations to increase clairity of the direct deposit content for FMP claims.]**
  
### Outcome

`How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?`

---

**Gague risk of new direct deposit content on a form and a static page on VA.gov - so that it is not introducing confusion for Veterans or an increase in calls/processing work.** 

---

### Research questions	
`What will I do with what I learn from this question?`
`Does this question serve the goals of my study?`

**`1. [How do Veterans react to the direct deposit informational alert on the introduction page?]**`

**`2. [Do Veterans most often click to the static page to "learn how to setup" or do they stay in the form flow?]**`

**`3. [Do Veterans confuse or quickly assume that their bank account information for FMP is the same as what they use for disability compensation?]**`

**`4. [Do Veterans express frustration about the separate direct deposit setup process for FMP claims and if so, what is their biggest pain point?]**`

**`5. [Do any Veterans say the direct deposit process mentioned in the content would be a blocker for them in filing online?]**`



### Hypotheses
 
---

**[Enter hypotheses here:]** 
- We assume that overall there will be some but minimal confusion about direct deposit being a separate process than what is used for VA Benefits.
- Most Veterans will not have an issue with the one-time setup instructions directed to FSC, but may comment on it being incovenient.

## Recruitment üéØ	
*OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers.*

### Recruitment approach
*Who is your intended audience for this research (e.g. Veterans, caregivers, VSOs, SMEs), and how will you recruit them?* 

### Recruitment criteria

- **Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants.**


### List the ideal completed sessions and total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study:

- `Veterans:` **[12]**
- `Caregivers:` **[0]**
- `Dependents:` **[0]**
- `Total:` **[12]**
- `Ideal completed sessions:` **[8]**

### Primary criteria (must-haves)
- `[Place primary criteria here between hash marks when in edit mode]`
-  Do you currently receive monthly disabilty compensation for a service connected condition? (Must answer yes to qualify) 
-  Are you currently living abroad? (Must answer yes to qualify) 
-  At least 2 participants who are female 
-  At least 2 participants who are 55 years or older 

#### Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)
- No more than 3 participants per each race/demographics category


## Timeline üóìÔ∏è
> [!NOTE]
> **Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person.** 

### Optional Kick-off Call with Perigean

- `Suggested dates and times:` **[Enter dates and times MM/DD HH:MM]**

### Prepare
*When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).*

**A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session.** 
> [!NOTE]
> **Send pilot participant email in study Slack channel**

- `Pilot participant name:` **[Enter name]**
- `Date and time of pilot session:` **[Enter time]** 

### Research sessions
- `Planned dates of research:` **[Enter dates MM/DD-MM/DD]**

### Length of sessions
- `Session length: (e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours)` **[45-60 minutes]**
  
- `Buffer time between sessions: (30 minutes recommended to reset between sessions, debrief with team, if a participant arrives late, or a session goes slightly over time)` **[45 minutes]**
  
- `Maximum Sessions per day: (We all have limits - how many sessions can you and your team conduct in one day considering the session length, the mental strain of conducting sessions, other work you still need to complete in a day, etc?)` **[3]**

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. 

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S. 

> [!TIP]
> Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. **(e.g. 3/17, Monday 9:00AM-1:00PM, 3:00PM-6:00PM EST; 3/18, Tuesday 9:00AM-6:00PM EST, etc.;** ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
