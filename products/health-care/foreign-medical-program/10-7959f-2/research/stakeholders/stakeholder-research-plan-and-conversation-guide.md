# 10-7959f-2 (FMP Claims Cover Sheet) Stakeholder Research Plan and Conversation Guide


## Research Goals:



* Inform the user journey map for FMP.
* Clarify eligibility and flow questions.
* Identify known pain points and opportunities for improvement that the digital form could positively impact.
* Identify gaps in knowledge and communication that the digital form could positively impact.
* Identify KPIs/OKRs and define the success of digitization from a stakeholder perspective.


## Extended Methodology

Potential participants were identified through conversation with Premal, the meet-and-greet with the FMP director (Andy Szymczak), and stakeholder interviews for VA Form 10-7959f-1 (FMP Registration). Participants for this methodology will include individuals working with the Foreign Medical Program (FMP) who process claims the form and/or work in escalations. Participants will be scheduled through **Microsoft Teams **to attend a 1hr interview session on **Microsoft Teams**. Participants will be asked in advance if they are comfortable using their webcam during the interview, having observers and note-takers in the call, and recording the interview. In addition, the participants will be asked in advance if they have access needs or accommodation requests that would make the interview more comfortable for them. 

Prior to the time of the interview, researchers will discuss who will be the primary and secondary facilitators and who will take notes. Responsibilities and roles will be claimed or annotated on the **[Mural Board](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1711319530759/0a07f0c0c866aea66dedcaa43017925806b9117f?sender=ub5dc086a14b6f943de142963)**. Facilitators and note-takers will arrive 10 minutes early to ensure the environment is properly prepared to conduct the interview, record the video, and take notes (checklist potentially incoming for this). A thread will be created in the **DSVA Slack - IVC Forms Interviews** channel with the naming convention **“Participant #1, Jan 18, 2024 - Feedback Backchannel Thread” **to enable communication between the observers and facilitator. Upon arrival, the facilitator will greet the participant; all other attendees will have cameras off and microphones muted. The facilitator will explain that the other attendees will observe and take notes as previously disclosed and will not interact with them. The facilitator will let the participant know they are starting the recording, clarify that they are looking for honest feedback, and reassure the participant that no feelings will be hurt and that none of the information shared will be used against them in any way. We will also inform them that their identities will be anonymized.

Once the interview starts, the note-taking team will be split into two areas of responsibility. Half of the note-takers will be responsible for gathering high-impact verbatim comments from the participants. The other half will be responsible for behavioral observations, focusing on reactions, tone, and body language in response to certain questions or at different points as they provide their answers. Upon completion of the interview, the participant will be thanked for their time and allowed to leave the call. If the interview ends early, the facilitator may ask the participant if they can open the floor for questions from observers. At this time, the observers can turn on their cameras and raise their hands to ask questions. The Q&A session will end 2 minutes before the agreed-upon meeting end time; be respectful of the participant’s time. All of the notes will be compiled in the **[Mural Board](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1711319530759/0a07f0c0c866aea66dedcaa43017925806b9117f?sender=ub5dc086a14b6f943de142963) **within 2 hours of the conclusion of the interview; please allow yourself time to process and transfer the notes while everything is still fresh in your mind. Analysis will take place after all interviews are complete so as not to bias future interviews.



## Discussion Guide (Questions)



1. Can you tell us about your role in the Foreign Medical Program (FMP)?
2. What is the history of FMP from your perspective?
    -  What solutions have been introduced to improve the program in the past, what worked, what didn’t? (add if the answer doesn’t lead into this discussion).
3. How do you interact with 10-7959f-2 at different touchpoints in your role? (in some detail)
4. Could you tell us a little bit about how the potential beneficiary’s journey begins with FMP? Where do they learn about the program? What is the first thing they normally interact with? 
    -  Can you tell us a bit about how that might be different for a Veteran living or traveling abroad vs. one enrolled in the Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) (also known as Chapter 31; formerly known as the VA Vocational Rehabilitation Program)?
   -  What percentage of Veterans enrolling in FMP are part of the VR&E?
        -  Does FMP still only cover expenses in foreign countries for Veterans in VR&E?
5. What opportunities for improvement do you see in the FMP from your role’s perspective and overall?
6. What pain points or obstacles have you encountered with 10-7959f-2 in your role?
    4.  What have you heard about pain points from others (stakeholders & people submitting claims)?
7. What is the biggest problem you believe we are trying to solve for Veterans through the program?
8. Are there any constraints you can think of that may be issues for us when digitizing 10-7959f-2 (or other forms if they don’t interact with 10-7959f-2)?
9. How do you currently define success for the FMP, and how would you define it for the digitization initiative?
10. Do you have any specific metrics that you track to measure success?  (It is important to address what specific OKRs/KPIs are used here if they don’t automatically go into it)
11. How do you imagine that we would most effectively involve you in the digitization of 10-7959f-2 moving forward?
12. From your perspective, how do you imagine your role fitting into the digital forms process as a whole in the future? 
13. Who else should I speak to in order to learn more? (closing question)
14. (Placeholder for a role-specific “clarification” question coming from our existing list.)
    -  If the Veteran can’t cash their reimbursement check in the country where they’re located, are there resources to help them figure out how to cash it?
    - For the purposes of this form, is the mailing address or physical address more important?
    - Is the mailing address always for the Veteran, or can it sometimes be for the provider (e.g., if the provider is the one being paid)?
    - What are the most common reasons a claim might be rejected?
    - What, if anything, is most commonly missing from a claims form that you need to process?
    - What are the most common reasons for an escalation?
    - Can they provide multiple claims under the same cover sheet or do they have to do a new cover sheet every time?
    - What kind of confirmation do folks get that their claim is being covered - just the check? Do they get a processing notification?
    - Can you provide us with a walkthrough of processing a claim/handling an escalation? It would be especially helpful if you can share your screen and do one live, if that’s relevant.
    - When signatures are submitted as part of the claims cover sheet, are they “checked” against other signatures on file?
