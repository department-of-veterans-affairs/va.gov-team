Every other Wednesday at 2:35pm ET

**03/26/25**
--------------------------------

Attendees: Andrea, Rachel, Renata, Jamie, Mike\
Leticia, Richard, Angela, Jennifer, Andrew

**Agenda**

-   Share content updates to inform users about direct deposit
-   Discuss updates made from service blueprint workshop

**Direct deposit**
  - Updates: application is ready, no changes required. We need input on the FMP claims form so it's ready to launch in mid-May.
  -   FMP claims feedback: sec. 5 of 7 "Payment selection":

      -   For launch, update the content to let Veterans know direct deposit will happen if they have an account in their VA Profile.
      -   Post-launch, we'd like to populate the bank account information in the form itself, providing Veterans the ability to confirm their information is correct and/or update that information

-   FMP question: is this just for stateside bank accounts? (A: yes, this is to nest with phase 1, just domestic bank accounts)
-   FMP: Are there ways to put caveats on this screen? (A: yes)
-   IVC: if an individual doesn't have any bank account in VA Profile/nothing is established, will the Veteran still receive a paper check? (A: If a Veteran makes a request for reimbursement for themselves, it's 99.9% of the time they have a domestic or foreign bank account. Most Veterans in this program have SCD rating 10% or above so they'd already be receiving payments. In majority of cases, bank account is already in VA Profile via VBA payments and that's the information FMP will be using for direct deposit.

-   Direct deposit action items:
    -   Tighten up any language to be clear this really will not work with foreign bank accounts
    -   Add more context in content (consider possible error messages?). Make it clear paper checks are continuing for foreign bank accounts.
    -   FMP will send an invite to discuss parity between paper form and the new online experience (want the paper form to reflect any language on VA.gov)
    -   IVC team will sent screenshots of the final version before we go live

**Service blueprint updates**

-   Walkthrough of all updates to the blueprint

-   AI: update blueprint to note that the vast majority of Veterans have that bank account on file because they're 10% SCD or higher and already receive payments from VBA (see question above from direct deposit discussion).

-   Next steps: IVC will be examining the blueprint to determine any things we can do for post-launch improvements, will bring that to the next meeting
