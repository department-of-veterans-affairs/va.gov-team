## FMP stakeholder sync
Every other Wednesday at 2:35pm ET

## **09/24/2025**

Attendees: Andrea, Mike Mooney, Jessica, Hieu, Renata, Premal, Amanda, Cindy C., Eileen, Leticia, Angela, Dirk, Jennifer, Andrew, Marvlin, Stephanie, Les, Michelle

**Agenda**

- Show off updates to FMP claims direct deposit

**Notes**

Jessica walks through the new flows and updates, with the goal of having the user jump out of the form the fewest number of times:

- **Happy path:** a Veteran has never filed an FMP claim previously, but has direct deposit set up already (VA.gov/VA Profile) and it's a domestic bank account)
  - Is it necessary to tell users about an AVA request?
    - The only situation would be travel pay where this information would be wrong - there is outreach we can do if reconciliation has to happen
    - Amanda points out the FMP team is able to reconcile issues whereas the FSC call center does not
      - Les says some Veterans have contacted (low volume, 2 users) FMP directly. More have often they contact the FMP Call Center and the back office coordinates those updates and reroutes the information for the Veteran. Third option, they contact FSC and then call the FMP call center.
      - If a payment returns an error, Dirk's team reaches out and contacts the Veteran to get that information fixed (Dirk's team coordinates between the Veteran and FSC)
      - If a payment goes through but it's the wrong account, that goes to the [FSC call center (**? need to confirm if that's correct**)]
      - When a payment is returned, the claim is cancelled. Les' team receives a report from CP&E to reopen that claim and reissue the payment after coordinating with the Veteran to update the payment and reissue payment 
    - **Pending decision:** to remove or keep the "contact us online through Ask VA" content

- **Second flow:** Veteran has filed or not filed before, but there's no direct deposit on file today (in VA profile or FSC). The Veteran is blocked until the form can detect an account on file
  - No FMP questions/feedback

- **Third flow (likely the most common):** Veteran is authenticated, they have direct deposit on file, and can self declare if they have or have not filed a FMP claim previously. This design adds a warning alert (a Veteran haves an account in FSC)
  - Alert: It's on the Veteran to advise about the risks and decide whether to confirm direct deposit or not, but filing multiple claims this pattern may be ignored
    - FMP likes this, no changes
  - Other changes in this flow: removing "in the mail" content in the flow about sending payments. FMP approval to remove checks in the mail?
    - Amanda suggests we go to user testing around content like this before going live
    - Dirk suggests the "by mail" would be useful just for general knowledge for Veterans (the FMP call center does get calls from Veterans asking whether Providers get direct deposit like them)
    - **Pending decision:** ran out of time, will pick up this discussion next week

**Action items**
- Premal to schedule a follow-up early next week to finish discussing these flows
- Agenda to include addressing any pending decisions above
- Health Apps UX team to update service blueprint with changes to process discussed in the past 2 meetings


## **09/18/2025**

Attendees: Jessica, Renata, Premal, Andrew

**Agenda**

Discuss questions uncovered in Jessica's FMP claims design discovery:
- What is the best course of action for Veterans who are blocked from entering the form in these scenarios - to help with error message content guidance? Would it be to call and if so the general number or a different/specific one? Or to add in profile and wait before completing the form?
- Should all Veterans really be blocked if they have previously filed? Esp since (I think) this is a single claim/visit process? What happens when there are 2 visits and the second claim is blocked by this question setup?
- Are there any concerns or additional context needed in the previous filed, direct deposit scenario (warning alert) it that path is allowed?

**Notes**

- Discussing the current state, to confirm:
  - There's no paper checks
  - There's no way to update direct deposit over the phone

**Answer:** that's all correct -- VA is moving away from paper checks for everything. Right now the best path for users to update their Direct Deposit information is through an Ask VA ("AVA") request, not calling the FSC Call center (though, more discovery needed if calling the call center a user can actually confirm which bank information they have on file with FSC or VBA/Profile).

**Scenarios we need to accommodate in the claims form:**

1. A Veteran who has never filed an FMP claim before **and** does not have direct deposit on file and currently receives paper checks from VBA
  -    Happy path is VA.gov and not FSC/CEP (future state)
  -    For the time being:

        -  Stop the user from filing a claim online...yet

        - Direct them to set up direct deposit in VA Profile
        
        - Users **do not** need to be instructed to wait 30 days to file their claim online. With the current backlog of claims, the claim will not be touched or processed before FSC does another monthly data pull for bank accounts.
        
        - This flow **does** need to indicate to users that adding direct deposite would change their preference for all entitlement payments for VBA benefits as well (no more paper checks)         
2. A Veteran who has filed a FMP claim before who did it by paper, and they have a separate bank account for their FMP checks as from their VBA direct deposit
  - Andy notes this should be a very small group of users - VA Direct Deposit consolidation started in April 2024, starting with the GI Bill, but expending to other VA benefits, and it should be 1 bank account for all VA payments
  - Premal notes because of how FSC currently works, if you update direct deposit via FSC, it won't update anywhere else. So, how do we verify it's the same bank account in VBA/VA Profile and FSC?
    - We assume that yes, users can call the call center to confirm they have the correct direct deposit information on file
      - If yes, direct deposit information is correct: allow users to proceed with digital claim submission
      - If no, not correct: we need to confirm if users can update that information with the call center over the phone, or go to https://www.cep.fsc.va.gov/ to update it (or submit an Ask VA request)
3. Veteran has filed before, but don't have Direct Deposit
  - Set the expectation with the user that they cannot file for personal reimbursement unless they have direct deposit set up through VBA/VA Profile)
    - Note that this only applies to Veterans who have a domestic bank account. The minority who receive funds to a foreign bank account cannot benefit from direct deposit.
      - Payments to foreign bank accounts and to foreign providers is by check, but that's also changing soon. 
      - Only a few thousand users have foreign bank accounts who are registered for FMP
      - Andy will be standing up a new direct deposit process specifically for these users, but for the time being, they cannot use the online submission process

**Other considerations**
- Andy would like a CTA about routing questions about FMP through Ask VA, not the call center
- References to paying providers by check should be removed from VA.gov content. The checkbox to pay the provider directly in the form can stay, however. 

**Action Items**
- Confirm if FSC call center can confirm direct deposit banking information by phone AND update banking information for a user
- Discovery on Ask VA process

## **08/13/25**

Attendees: Andrea, Mike, Angela, Jennifer, Andrew, Premal, Nicole, Stephanie Slater

**Agenda**

-   Status of FMP Claims
-   Discuss possibility of adding the FMP eligibility letter to VA.gov to save time for the enrollment team and veterans

**Notes**

**FMP Claims Status & Fraud Prevention**
- Update from Andy: Ongoing investigation into fraudulent FMP claims from international providers. Evidence shows providers are submitting reimbursement requests for more visits than the veteran actually attended.
- Discussion:
  - Short-term process: Users submit an application, and they receive an email confirmation of receipt.
- Long-term goal: Develop a health status tool to allow users to check enrollment and claims status, and view previously submitted claims.
  - First phase: ChampVA applications → then ChampVA claims.
  - FMP forms will follow later due to infrastructure limitations (e.g., VES integration not ready).

**FMP Claims Status & Fraud Prevention**
- Premal’s input: Shared that the FMP team has a strong interest in making the FMP claims form available online, even if the direct deposit experience is not yet ideal. He has communicated this interest to OCTO leadership so they understand the urgency from the FMP perspective.
- Team decision: Keep release on pause until OCTO decides the best path forward, given previous efforts to improve the direct deposit user experience.
- Security decision: Lock down FMP claims to LOA 3 to ensure users are verified veterans.

**FMP Eligibility Letter on VA.gov**
- Premal’s possible proposal: Generate the enrollment letter from IBA data.
- Andy’s update: The team has requested adding the FMP eligibility letter to VA.gov’s benefits letters and documents repository.
  - Process: Users select the letter, verify their address, and generate it with the most up-to-date data.
  - Benefit: Reduces workload for the enrollment team.
- Action: Andy will send a current copy of the letter to Premal for his discussions.
- Data request: Premal requested the FMP team start collecting impact data — e.g., average time to input a claim, application time, and other metrics to measure the current experience for both veterans and processing staff.

**Action Items**
- Andy to send a current copy of the FMP eligibility letter to Premal.
- FMP Team to start collecting impact data on current claim and application processes.
- Premal to continue representing the FMP team’s interest in online claims form release to OCTO leadership.

**Decisions**
- Keep FMP claims form release on pause until OCTO decides the path forward.
- Lock down FMP claims to LOA 3 for veteran verification.


## **04/9/25**

Attendees: Andrea, Rachel, Jamie, Mike
Leticia, Richard, Angela, Jennifer, Andrew

**Agenda**

-   FMP Claims launch update
-   Demo of the single document submission
-   Direct deposit touch base
-   Future opportunities – claims resubmissions, notice of enrollment/rejection via email

**Notes**

**FMP Claims launch update**
* Touched based on the launch Stages release. Tentative Launch date 4/20. Will adjust depending on the volume.
* From FMP: Can we share that we are launching with the VSOs? We suggested we announce it to them after 100%. Probably let them know it’s a mid may launch. 


**Demo of the single document submission**
  * FMP was concerned about the file naming convention with PEGA. IVC will use the same naming convention that we used for all forms. IVC came up with the convention. 
  * Good feedback from FMP on the single file format \

**Direct deposit touch base**
  * Go live will be with a small test batch on April 15th
  * May 18/19th will be the larger release
  * Mid June will be 100% released for EFT to Veterans with domestic Banks accounts. Foreign accounts will follow that but there is no set timeline as of now.
  * FMP will track how many payment EFT will going out to Veterans
  * We don’t have to update the content to match the staged release. We can keep the EFT info on it through the launch.
  * VBA vs VHA
            * VBA is what is on VA.gov
            * VHA is FSC (Financial Services Center)
            * IVC needs to confirm where they are pulling the banking info from
            *  On a Monthly basis FSC (VHA) will extract the database from VBA 
            * VBA is the Source of truth for back account


**Future opportunities – claims resubmissions, notice of enrollment/rejection via email**
* Presented a high-level ideas for
    * Building UI and backend to handle Claims resubmissions: FMP will demo what the process looks like from their end and what is on the Sendback letter when we are ready to pursue that. 
    * Combining Reg and Claim in one form experience: No push back on that. FMP current process is built for it but we can enhance the UI for the users to send both at the same time. This is possible a lower impact one. 
    * Communicating Claims/Reg decisions via email: This would be very high impact and FMP is very interested. We will need to talk to Premal about coordinating with the other contractors that are working on their systems. 
  
## **03/26/25**

Attendees: Andrea, Rachel, Renata, Jamie, Mike\
Leticia, Richard, Angela, Jennifer, Andrew

**Agenda**

-   Share content updates to inform users about direct deposit
-   Discuss updates made from service blueprint workshop

**Direct deposit**
  - Updates: application is ready, no changes required. We need input on the FMP claims form so it's ready to launch in mid-May.
  -   FMP claims feedback: sec. 5 of 7 "Payment selection":

      -   For launch, update the content to let Veterans know direct deposit will happen if they have an account in their VA Profile.
      -   Post-launch, we'd like to populate the bank account information in the form itself, providing Veterans the ability to confirm their information is correct and/or update that information

-   FMP question: is this just for stateside bank accounts? (A: yes, this is to nest with phase 1, just domestic bank accounts)
-   FMP: Are there ways to put caveats on this screen? (A: yes)
-   IVC: if an individual doesn't have any bank account in VA Profile/nothing is established, will the Veteran still receive a paper check? (A: If a Veteran makes a request for reimbursement for themselves, it's 99.9% of the time they have a domestic or foreign bank account. Most Veterans in this program have SCD rating 10% or above so they'd already be receiving payments. In majority of cases, bank account is already in VA Profile via VBA payments and that's the information FMP will be using for direct deposit.

-   Direct deposit action items:
    -   Tighten up any language to be clear this really will not work with foreign bank accounts
    -   Add more context in content (consider possible error messages?). Make it clear paper checks are continuing for foreign bank accounts.
    -   FMP will send an invite to discuss parity between paper form and the new online experience (want the paper form to reflect any language on VA.gov)
    -   IVC team will sent screenshots of the final version before we go live

**Service blueprint updates**

-   Walkthrough of all updates to the blueprint

-   AI: update blueprint to note that the vast majority of Veterans have that bank account on file because they're 10% SCD or higher and already receive payments from VBA (see question above from direct deposit discussion).

-   Next steps: IVC will be examining the blueprint to determine any things we can do for post-launch improvements, will bring that to the next meeting
