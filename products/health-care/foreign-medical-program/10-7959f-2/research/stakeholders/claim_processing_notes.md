# 2-12-25 FMP Claims Processing Meeting


## Steps to Process

Before they begin processing, they must check the Veteran’s SSN to confirm they are in Vista.  Vista lists service connected conditions and physical address (it says Panama clearly)



* Need to find the the full name and address of provider, DX, what type of appointments (medical) on the claim 


* They then look for what was being treated and manually cross-reference it with the service connected conditions listed in Vista to see if it matches



* They match info to what is in Vista

* They will check the Veteran’s claims history manually in Vista to see if claim that they are working on has ever been processed before
* If the claim does not appear in the history they can move forward with processing it



* Then hit enter/enter to move through the screens and leave some of the data fields blank \



* They then assign a tracking number to the Veteran in a spreadsheet (FMP tracking system). 
* The claims processor has a log sheet 1000 claims per tracking number and states that 1000 claims can be processed per tracking number \
They add the tracking number to the vista screen



* They can usually do a key command to bring up the last veteran’s details that they looked at - spacebar-enter


    * Risk: They can cause improper data entry if they are not careful. This can occur if they were at another Veteran data before continuing to process another Veteran’s claim.
    * They have to type in the SSN again in Vista to bring up the Veteran’s info if viewed by another's Veteran info prior to adding the tracking number .  \
 



* They have to repeat entering tracking numbers in Vista 


* They copy from the claim screen to the tracking sheet


* Goes back to FMP screen and types in 9 - process claim


* On the process claim screen they enter the tracking number that they assigned to the veteran to the claim. Then they get a claim number


* They have to type in the name of the provider. If it matches the address they select that provider


* They enter a type of service:  outpatient, inpatient, RX dental and durable medical. 


* Then type in the date 


* Type in Place of service code (this is where it happens


* Then the enter Assignment of Benefits - y = provider


* Goes back to claim cover sheet and looks at the checkbox


* They don't deal with OHI or patient responsibility so they leave that blank


* Then they enter claim entry line by line

## Codes
* They do not use provider codes so they have to manually type in the name of the provider. This makes it difficult to find
* They have a list of commonly used DX codes in a cheat sheet



* Procedure code: Adam uses a cheat sheet to get the commonly used code - he uses 99214 - this is a doctor's office consultation 


* They do have an encoder pro tool on optum - [encoderpro.com](http://encoderpro.com/) to look up DX codes


* You can also type it into Google if they don't give you a DX code - you can type in a generic code if one wasn't provided


* ICD-9Code


* Can also google what the DX code would be and cross reference with Encoder Pro Tool
* If the provider didn’t supply DX code on the bill that can use a placeholder code (Does this code ever need to be updated to the correct one?)
* They always verify the DX codes even if it was given to them on the billing statement.



* They enter the billed amount from the bill. If the amount is in a different currency they have to convert the amount to dollars


* We are going to put in zero dollars to deny the claim


* They select line item reason for claim denials: Reason he selected was “Provider suspended or excluded from federal health care programs”


* They have to enter the denial code again so the reason will show up on the claim. Once “enter” is pressed the claim is created

## Misc
* Before PEGA they used PDI’s (Primary Document Index - PDI) but they now don't need to with PEGA.
* FMP deals with these services: outpatient, inpatient, RX dental and durable medical. They used to deal with travel but not anymore
* The most important field to fill out on the pdf is “who to pay”. In Vista this is the “Assignment of Benefits” question
* FMP doesn’t deal with OHI.
* Spaces in Vista that don’t need data entry will cause issues if data is entered. This may cause the claim to stop processing. For example, don't need OHI info and the data entered in those fields would cause an error. 
* They would have to convert foreign currency to USD. They use an approved convertor tool for FMP
* They need to manually deny claims. They enter the denial code twice: one for the line item and one for the explanation for denial. The explanation will be at the bottom of the claim
* PPR =EOB
* They always check PPR for accuracy. This shows everything that was entered into the claim to review. They can't print it but they can view it 
* They can look up the claim by the claim# if there is only one claim (in the packet?) other wise the they will look up the tracking #. The tracking # will bring up every claim it’s associated with
* Once the claims processor says “yes” to this the claim is in a verified status - then a lead would come in and release the claim for payment
* They just require a description of what was treated and what the service was for each claim. They can look up the rest.
* They don’t  have to separate the docs unless there are multiple veterans on the claims.
* Sometimes they get CHAMPVA forms that need to be sent out to the correct department.
