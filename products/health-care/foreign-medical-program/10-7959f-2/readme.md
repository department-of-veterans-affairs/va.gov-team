# **10-7959f-2 FMP Claim Form**


## **Overview**

For a Veteran who gets medical care outside the U.S. for a service-connected condition, FMP may cover the cost of their care. Veterans can use this form to submit their medical claims for the Foreign Medical Program. This program allows the Veteran to complete their registration at the same time that they are also completing their first FMP claim.


## **Desired User Outcomes**



* Veterans are able to fill out the FMP claim form and submit their supporting documents online on [VA.gov](VA.gov).
* Veterans spend less time, effort and money filling out and mailing paperwork
* Veterans spend less time spent waiting to hear back on the status of their claim or reimbursement
