# **10-7959f-1 FMP Registration Form**


## **Overview**

For a Veteran who gets medical care outside the U.S. for a service-connected condition, FMP may cover the cost of their care. Veterans can use this form to register for the Foreign Medical Program so they can submit medical claims for reimbursement. This program allows the Veteran to complete their registration at the same time that they are also completing their first [FMP claims](https://www.va.gov/health-care/file-foreign-medical-program-claim/).


## **Desired User Outcomes**



* Veterans are able to fill out the registration form online on VA.gov
* Veterans spend less time, effort and money filling out and mailing paperwork
* Veterans spend less time spent waiting to hear back on the status of their enrollment
