# Research Plan for Integrated Veteran Care (IVC) Team, Form 10-7959f-1, February 2023 


## Background

This study will support the unauthenticated digital flow for Form 10-7959f-1 and the Foreign Medical Program (FMP). We will be building this as a new digital form, so there will be no familiarity from the perspective of the Veterans. However, we will specifically attempt to recruit participants familiar with the paper form and program. \


[Product brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/foreign-medical-program/10-7959f-1/10-7959f-1%20product%20outline.md)


### OCTO Priorities



* Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience
* Fast-track disability claims
* Drive OIT’s Digital Transformation Strategy


### Veteran Journey



* Starting up - Attending to health needs
* Taking care of myself - Managing primary care and chronic health issues, maintaining my health  
* Putting down roots - engaging VA to access benefits and services
* Retiring - taking care of my health
* Aging - managing my declining health


## Research Goals



* Test the usability of the current iteration of the 10-7959f-1 prototype.
* Test high-level accessibility for the current iteration of the 10-7959f-1  prototype.
* Gain insights related to participants’ experience with the current 10-7959f-1 process and FMP, which will inform efforts to address pain points discovered during stakeholder interviews.


### Research questions



* Will users understand and be able to easily use the 10-7959f-1 prototype?
* What are the major accessibility issues we can remediate?
* What are major pain points users encounter during the 10-7959f-1 or with the FMP? 


### Hypothesis



* Based on our understanding of current patterns and best practices for forms, the digital prototype 10-7959f-1 will be easy to understand and navigate.
* Based on our understanding of accessibility best practices, we believe the 10-7959f-1 prototype will be free of major accessibility issues.
* Based on research our team has done on previous forms, we believe participants will mention pain points such as:
    * Lengthy processing time
    * Frustration with the lack of online submission options
    * For Veterans participating in the Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) (also known as Chapter 31; formerly known as the VA Vocational Rehabilitation Program), frustration with not knowing what might be covered


## Methodology

This methodology will be a mixed-method approach, combining a usability study with a user interview. There will be 30-40 minutes of usability testing, utilizing the think-out-loud protocol to identify major issues with the digital form. \
 \
The exit interview questions will be asked in the remaining 20-30 minutes, less any time it takes to prepare or troubleshoot for the participant. We want to ask these questions at the end to avoid any bias that may impact interactions with the prototype and comments gathered through the execution of the think-out-loud protocol.

This method is appropriate for the goals of the research by addressing said goals directly. The maturity of the design should be appropriate to accommodate all of the aforementioned research. In order to clarify the limited accessibility research that we plan to do at this time, we will be using a version of the form that has been published to the staging site in this capacity. This will help us identify any major accessibility issues earlier in the process. This allows us to make corrections to those major issues in advance of moving them into final code or production, potentially saving us significant rework and capacity.


### Location

Zoom will be the desired location for the research.

### Recruitment approach

Our intended audience for this research is Veterans who have registered for FMP. We will be utilizing Perigean to help us recruit our participants. We will use the lean maximum variation inclusive recruitment strategy outlined by OCTO.


### Recruitment criteria

We would like to work with Perigean to recruit for 9 full sessions.

**User groups:**

Cohort 1: 6 (of 9) Veterans who are living or traveling abroad and enrolled in FMP

Cohort 2: 3 (of 9) enrolled in VR&E and FMP

**Demographics:**



* At least 4 participants aged 55-64+
* At least 4 participants have a cognitive disability
* At least 2 participants live in a rural area
* At least 2 participants have no degree
* At least 1 participant is a woman
* At least 8 participants are expats (living abroad); the remaining 1 participant should have lived abroad and used FMP when living abroad, but does not need to currently live abroad
* At least 2 participants are of immigrant origin
* At least 2 participants are Black
* At least 2 participants are Hispanic
* At least 1 participant is Asian
* At least 1 participant is Native
* At least 1 participant is gay, lesbian, or bisexual
* At least 1 participant is transgender, nonbinary, gender fluid, gender queer, Two-Spirit (Indigenous only), or another gender beyond man or woman
* At least 2 participants use screen readers
* At least 1 participant uses some other kind of assistive technology

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)** 

At least 4 participants completed their FMP registration on a mobile device (tablet okay)

At least 1 participant used their FMP benefits during a short trip abroad (i.e., a vacation)

At least 1 participant used their FMP benefits during medical tourism

At least 2 participants used their FMP benefits while living abroad for an extended period of time


### Screener questions



1. Are you enrolled in the Foreign Medical Program (FMP)? [Yes to qualify]
2. Are you enrolled in the Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) (also known as Chapter 31; formerly known as the VA Vocational Rehabilitation Program)? [Yes or no is okay]
3. Have you used your FMP benefits [any are okay]:
    1. During a short trip abroad (i.e., a vacation)
    2. During medical tourism
    3. While you were living abroad
