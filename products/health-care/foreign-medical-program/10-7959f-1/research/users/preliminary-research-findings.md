# Preliminary Form Improvements: Form 10-7959f-1 (FMP Registration)

This document lists first-impression quick fixes to form 10-7959f-1 discovered during user research. It is not intended to serve as a research report and does not cover all research findings. It is not the result of full analysis but rather documents gut-feeling best guesses by researchers.


## Things we don’t need to go through the design system for



* Most users expect to receive an email confirmation when they submit the registration. Let’s send them an email.
    * Tell people approximately how long until they receive a response, and by what method (mail? email?).
    * Consider providing contact details and next steps, if they don’t hear from the VA by a certain date.
        * Several participants mentioned having issues contacting the FMP or VA by phone. In this case, email or AVA information could be very valuable to users.
    * Consider providing instructions on how to retrieve the application at a later date.
    * Consider providing instructions on how to update their information after they’ve submitted their application.
* Remove formatting requirements like dashes, parens, etc. whenever possible.
* If possible, customize addresses for each country or include extra lines for foreign  countries.
* Explain what the VA will use phone number, address, and email address for so users are able choose the right ones for them; many Veterans overseas have more than one of each.
* Provide brief explanations in the content about mailing vs. home address and its relevance to the FMP.
    * There was some confusion among participants, if not on the meaning of these two, then on how FMP would use them.


## Things we should go through the design system for



* Add helper text to the VA file number explaining what it is and who has one.


## Unsure if we should go through the design system



* Add country code to the phone number, and remove limits on the number of numbers and the format.
* On the review page, expand all the accordions or just lay out all the information on one page with no accordions.
* Consider leaving “select” in the “suffix” field when no suffix has been added.
* Tell users the benefit of signing on on the page where they are prompted to do so.
* There seemed to be some significant confusion about the program's coverage and what some exceptions (FDA approval, etc.) could be.
    * Consider suggesting changes to the content page to outline the benefits more concisely.
    * Consider this when working on the claims form and consider what information users may need in that context.
