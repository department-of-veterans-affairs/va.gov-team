## **Initial Findings**


### Finding #1



* There were [various usability issues](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/foreign-medical-program/10-7959f-1/research/users/preliminary-research-findings.md) found through testing that should be taken under consideration.


### Finding #2



* Veterans want more transparency into the status of their registration and claims at the FMP.
    * 4 out of 4 participants with FMP benefits expressed a desire for an easier way to keep track of their claims. 

P8: “I would really like a website that would give me some visibility into this process so I don’t have to keep comprehensive notes about every contact, every bill, every $100. [I could] just send it off and not worry about whether or not it’s coming back and if I have to follow up. That would save me a lot of stress.”


### Finding #3



* Veterans experience many difficulties receiving reimbursement for their overseas care as a result of confusion over responsibility for certain forms of compensation within the VA, stringent documentation requirements, and slow mailing times. 
    * 3 out of 4 participants with FMP benefits expressed frustration with the difficulties they experience with receiving overseas care. Notably, the only participant with FMP benefits that didn’t express this frustration receives all their care at a third-party facility that bills FMP directly.

P8: “The way it works in Canada is I get a bill, I send it to VAC. VAC looks at it, doesn’t know what to do with it, drops it on the floor…. Eventually, they figure out what’s going on and fax it .... Then the USVA sits on it for like 3 to 6 months and sends it back to VAC…I have thousands of dollars of unpaid bills just kind of floating in the ether…. Providers cut me off because they don’t get paid on time.”


### Finding #4



* Veterans strongly prefer providers who will bill FMP directly, but depending on where they are located, there may not be any providers that do so.
    * 2 out of 4 participants with FMP benefits either seek treatment from providers who will directly bill FMP. One additional participant mentioned they wished they could find providers that would do so. 


### Finding #5



* Many participants had misconceptions about the availability or coverage offered through the FMP. 
    * At least 5 out of 7 participants without FMP benefits didn’t know or misunderstood what FMP covers. 
* The quote below represents a misconception of FMP coverage. FMP does not cover all care in foreign countries - it only covers care related to service-connected conditions.

P7: “I said, well, that's not what FMP is for. It's for anything because I'm residing in a foreign country. So, anyway, not having to blame belabor the point, it was just very frustrating to get a straight answer from anybody.”


### Finding #6



* Veterans often had more than two mailing addresses and phone numbers (e.g., those who spent part of the year at a second property) but didn't know how to inform FMP which one to use in a specific scenario without filing an entirely new form or calling FMP. 


### Opportuntities for improvement on the form



* A number of improvements can be made to the form to ease the Veteran experience.
    * Most Veterans don’t understand what a “VA file number” is unless they have one.
    * Most participants expected the review page to have the accordions pre-expanded.
    * They explained that they wouldn’t go through the extra steps of expanding each accordion to check their information, but would likely look it over if the information were displayed all at once.
    * Participants who lived abroad have trouble correctly entering their phone numbers and addresses if the inputs aren’t flexible enough.
    * If Veterans update their information on an FMP application or claim, they expect it to update in the entire VA system, but it doesn’t.
