# Research Plan for Integrated Veteran Care (IVC) Team, Form 10-7959f-1, March 2024 


## Background

This study will support the unauthenticated digital flow for Form 10-7959f-1 and the Foreign Medical Program (FMP). We will be building this as a new digital form, so there will be no familiarity from the perspective of the Veterans. However, we will specifically attempt to recruit participants familiar with the paper form and program. We are most interested in testing content and interviewing users about their experience with FMP. 


[Product brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/foreign-medical-program/10-7959f-1/10-7959f-1%20product%20outline.md)


### OCTO Priorities



* Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience
* Drive OIT’s Digital Transformation Strategy


### Veteran Journey



* Starting up - Attending to health needs
* Taking care of myself - Managing primary care and chronic health issues, maintaining my health  
* Putting down roots - engaging VA to access benefits and services
* Retiring - taking care of my health
* Aging - managing my declining health


## Research Goals



* Test content comprehension for the current iteration of the 10-7959f-1 form
* Gain insights related to participants’ experience with the current 10-7959f-1 process and FMP, which will inform efforts to address pain points discovered during stakeholder interviews


### Research questions



* Will users understand the content on the 10-7959f-1 digital form?
* What are major pain points users encounter with the 10-7959f-1 digital form or with the FMP? 


### Hypothesis



* Based on our CAIA collaborations, users will be able to easily understand content on the 10-7959f-1 digital form.
* Based on research our team has done on previous forms, we think participants will mention pain points with FMP such as:
    * Lengthy processing time for claims
    * Lack of electronic funds transfer
    * Frustration with the lack of online submission options
    * Lack of visibility into registration and claims status
    * For Veterans participating in the Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) (also known as Chapter 31; formerly known as the VA Vocational Rehabilitation Program), frustration with not knowing what might be covered


## Methodology

This methodology will be a user interview, utilizing a Figma prototype of the form as a visual stimulus. The study will begin by showing the participants the prototype and asking them questions about their expectations and understanding of some specific terminology in context for the first 10-20 minutes. 
 
The exit interview questions will be asked in the remaining 20-30 minutes, less any time it takes to prepare or troubleshoot for the participant. We want to ask these questions at the end to avoid any bias that may impact interactions with the prototype, and comments gathered through the execution of the think-out-loud protocol.

This method is appropriate for the goals of the research by addressing said goals directly. The maturity of the design should be appropriate to accommodate all of the aforementioned research. 


### Location

Research will take place over Zoom.

### Recruitment approach

Our intended audience for this research is Veterans who are eligible for FMP. We will be utilizing Perigean to help us recruit our participants. We will use the lean maximum variation inclusive recruitment strategy outlined by OCTO.


### Recruitment criteria

We would like to work with Perigean to recruit for 12 full sessions.

**User groups:**

Cohort 1: 6 (of 12) Veterans who are eligible for FMP, but have not registered

Cohort 2: 6 (of 12) Veterans are registered for FMP

**Demographics:**



* At least 6 participants aged 55-64+
* At least 6 participants have a cognitive disability
* At least 3 participants live in a rural area
* At least 3 participants have no degree
* At least 2 participant is are women
* At least 5 participants are ex-pats (living abroad)
* At least 3 participants are of immigrant origin
* At least 2 participants are Black
* At least 2 participants are Hispanic
* At least 1 participant is Asian
* At least 1 participant is Native
* At least 1 participant is gay, lesbian, or bisexual
* At least 1 participant is transgender, nonbinary, gender fluid, gender queer, Two-Spirit (Indigenous only), or another gender beyond man or woman
* At least 1 participant is enrolled in both VR&E (Ch. 31) and FMP
* At least 4 participants use some assistive technology that **does not** require code to function fully 
* At least 6 participants on a mobile device (tablet okay)


### Screener questions



1. Do you have a VA-rated service-connected disability? 
    1. _[Recruit if yes; if they say “no”, recruit if they say “yes” to the next program AND live abroad]_
2. Are you enrolled in the Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) (Chapter 31, formerly the VA Vocational Rehabilitation Program)? 
    2. _[Yes or no is okay]_
    3. _If no to both question 1 and question 2, do not recruit_
3. Are you enrolled in the Foreign Medical Program (FMP)? 
    4. Yes = Cohort 2
    5. No or I don’t know = Cohort 1
4. (If they answered ‘yes’ to Question 1) When have you used your FMP benefits (check all that apply) _[Any are okay]:_
    6. During a short trip abroad (i.e., a vacation)
    7. During medical tourism
    8. While you were living abroad
    9. I have never used my benefits
