## **Research Goals**

This research provided insight into the Foreign Medical Program (FMP) and the FMP registration form, Form 10-7959f-1. With this form, Veterans can register with FMP to receive reimbursement for medical care and supplies related to their service-connected conditions overseas. After registering for FMP, Veterans are able to submit claims for reimbursement. While veterans may be familiar with the paper form and with FMP as a whole, the digital form was newly created during this effort.

The moments that matter within the Veteran journey are:



* Starting up - Attending to health needs
* Taking care of myself - Managing primary care and chronic health issues, maintaining my health
* Putting down roots - engaging VA to access benefits and services
* Retiring - taking care of my health
* Aging - managing my declining health

The overarching research goals for this project were:



* **Goal 1:** Test content comprehension for the current iteration of the 10-7959f-1 form
* **Goal 2:** Gain insights related to participants’ experience with the current 10-7959f-1 process and FMP


## **Research Questions**



* Will users understand the content on the 10-7959f-1 digital form?
    * Are there any sections in the content of this form that Veterans find confing?
    * Is there anywhere where additional content could provide clarity for Veterans?
* What are the major pain points users encounter with the 10-7959f-1 digital form or with the FMP?
    * What are the opportunities to improve the form flow?
    * What are the opportunities to improve individual components?
*  What are the major pain points users encounter with the FMP?


## **Methodology**

Conducted hour-long remote moderated research sessions via Zoom from March 18 - 29, 2024. Participants were asked to think aloud while navigating a [Figma prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/PzB1F5TYuBK5KQgPbuhAwH/10-7959f-1?page-id=732%3A40895&type=design&node-id=732-41541&viewport=-1546%2C-54%2C0.25&t=5E0jHhR2ptW6Vm4D-1&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=732%3A41541) of the unauthenticated experience and were then asked a series of open-ended questions regarding their experience with FMP.


## **Hypotheses and Conclusions**



* **Uers will be able to easily understand the content on the 10-7959f-1 digital form.**
    * Mostly true.
    * Participants were able to move quickly and easily through the registration form. 
    * 7 out of 11 participants experienced some confusion when asked for their home and mailing addresses. Though most were able to clearly articulate the difference when asked, they generally skimmed the content and didn’t initially understand why they were being asked for two different addresses.  
    * 1 participant mentioned they had two different mailing addresses and wouldn’t know how to properly indicate to the FMP which one to use and when.
* **Participants will mention pain points with FMP such as lengthy processing time for claims, lack of electronic funds transfer, frustration with the lack of online submission options, and lack of visibility into registration and claims stat.**
    * Definitely true.
    * All participants mentioned one or more of these pain points.
* **For Veterans participating in the Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) (also known as Chapter 31; formerly known as the VA Vocational Rehabilitation Program), we hypothesize that they will be frustrated by not knowing what might be covered.**
    * Not enough information.
    * 1 of the 11 participants we spoke to were enrolled in VR&E, but they were not enrolled in FMP, so we did not discuss the relationship between the two programs.


## **Key Findings**



1. There were various usability issues found through testing that should be taken under consideration.
2. Veterans want more transparency into the status of their FMP registration and their FMP claims.
3. Veterans experience a number of difficulties receiving reimbursement for their overseas care as a result of confusion over responsibility for certain forms of compensation within the VA, stringent documentation requirements, and slow mailing times.
4. Veterans strongly prefer providers who will bill FMP directly, but depending on where they are located, there may not be any providers that do so.
5. Many participants had misconceptions about the availability or coverage offered through the FMP. 
6. Veterans often had more than two mailing addresses and phone numbers (These were often participants who spent part of the year at a second property) different mailing addresses and phone numbers but didn't know how to inform FMP which one to use in a specific scenario without filing an entirely new form or calling FMP. 


## **Details of Findings**

### Finding 1: Potential form improvements



* Most Veterans don’t understand what a “VA file number” is unless they have one. Most skipped over the VA file number input until asked about it. When asked, Veterans expressed confusion and varying beliefs about what it is:
    * A number connected to disability filings or claims
    * A number connected to claims in MyHealtheVet
    * An identifier for Veterans who don't have social security number
    * An identifier for dependents
    * A number that would be associated with this specific application and should have been given to them after filing.
* Most participants expected the review page to have the accordions pre-expanded. They explained that they wouldn’t go through the extra steps of expanding each accordion to check their information but would likely look it over if the information were displayed all at once.
* Most participants didn’t expect the in-line edit experience but were pleasantly surprised by it. 
* Participants who live abroad have trouble correctly entering their phone numbers and addresses if the inputs aren’t flexible enough.
* If Veterans update their information on an FMP application or claim, they expect it to update in the entire VA system (but it doesn’t).



### Finding 2: Veterans want more transparency into the status of their FMP registration and their FMP claims. 

4 out of 4 participants with FMP benefits expressed a desire for an easier way to keep track of their claims.



* P8: “I would really like a website that would give me some visibility into this process so I don’t have to keep comprehensive notes about every contact, every bill, every $100. [I could] just send it off and not worry about whether or not it’s coming back and if I have to follow up. That would save me a lot of stress.”
* P8: “I like [an email] when I submit stuff electronically. That’s kind of the modern receipt, right?”


### Finding 3: Veterans experience a number of difficulties receiving reimbursement for their overseas care as a result of confusion or poor communication about who covers certain benefits within the VA, stringent documentation requirements, and slow mailing times. 

3 out of 4 participants with FMP benefits expressed frustration with the difficulties they experience with receiving overseas care.



* P10: “So the Foreign Medical Program guide is very clear on how to be reimbursed for medications…. It’s a little difficult here, just because that’s not how the pharmacy will pump out a receipt … I know I can make a memorandum, [but] it’s quite cumbersome…. I don’t even file reimbursement for medication for any of my service-connected conditions just because of the cumbersome process.”
* A participant based in South Korea explained he hasn’t been able to receive reimbursement for his clothing allowance, which is covered because he is an amputee. FMP believes that the Pittsburgh office should cover the cost, while the Pittsburgh office claims it’s the FMP’s responsibility. FMP has also said that this Veteran should go to the “prosthetics department,” but the Veteran doesn’t have one available. They are, therefore, stuck with their clothing cost, even though they know it should be covered.
* P13: “If you continue to take this long to settle claims….Are you just hoping that we're gonna die?”
* P5: “If I use my US address, then it gets sent there, and then I have to do one of two things. I either have to have my family take a picture of the check so that I can take another picture of it and deposit it. Because they can’t deposit it in my bank for me. However, the problem with having it sent here is that it takes anywhere from 2 to 3 months to get the check.”

Confusion within the VA can also lead to frustration for the Veteran and delays in reimbursement.



* P10: “A few years ago I had contacted the White House hotline for Veterans just to see if maybe I could get some assistance…. After that call to the White House hotline, within about 4 or 5 minutes of each other, I had an email from Pittsburgh Regional Office telling me I needed to contact the Foreign Medical Program and [from] the Foreign Medical Program an email saying I need to contact Pittsburgh….2 emails within 4 or 5 minutes of each other.”
* P13: “The FMP does not interact with the VA.”

A participant based in Canada experienced frustration because, according to FMP policy, they should be sending their claims through VAC. However, VAC doesn’t know what to do with the claims, and there are huge delays in reimbursement. The Veteran in question has been stuck with thousands of dollars of unpaid bills, and some providers are refusing to see them because it takes them too long to get paid.



* P8: “The way it works in Canada is I get a bill, I send it to VAC. VAC looks at it, doesn’t know what to do with it, drops it on the floor…. Eventually, they figure out what’s going on and fax it .... Then the USVA sits on it for like 3 to 6 months and sends it back to VAC…I have thousands of dollars of unpaid bills just kind of floating in the ether…. Providers cut me off because they don’t get paid on time.”


### Finding 4: Veterans strongly prefer providers who will bill FMP directly, but depending on where they are located, there may not be any providers that do so.

2 out of 4 participants with FMP benefits either seek treatment from providers who will directly bill FMP.



* P5: “I try to see doctors - We're in a unique situation with FMP - that, you know, all of my doctors where I live at directly bill FMP for the most part.”


### Finding 5: Many participants had misconceptions about the availability or coverage offered through the FMP. 

At least 5 out of 7 participants without FMP benefits didn’t know or misunderstood what FMP covers.

2 of the 4 participants who had FMP benefits were informed of FMP benefits at a VA location; one heard about FMP at a third-party care organization that deals with FMP 



* P4: “I’m planning to go to Portugal, so can you cover me in Portugal and get me my medications in Portugal?”
* P7: “I said, well, that's not what FMP is for. It's for anything because I'm residing in a foreign country. So, anyway, not having to blame belabor the point, it was just very frustrating to get a straight answer from anybody.”
    * The above quote represents a misconception of FMP coverage. FMP does not cover all care in foreign countries - it only covers care related to service-connected conditions.


### Finding 6: Veterans sometimes had multiple mailing addresses and phone numbers but didn't know how to inform FMP which one to use in a specific scenario without filing an entirely new form or calling FMP. 

There was feedback from some participants who had multiple homes or changed residences depending on the time of year that keeping their addresses and contact information up to date can sometimes cause confusion. This feeling seems to be exacerbated when interacting with programs like the FMP.



* P4: “I have two different houses. I spend the summer in one location, winter in another, but I keep all of my formal [and] business stuff at one address….My mailing address would be my permanent address up north, but 6 months a year, I’m not there. I’m somewhere else…. But I wouldn’t consider mailing and home [address] different for me.”


## **Additional Insights**


### Additional Insight 1: Misunderstanding FMP coverage

P7 explained a scenario where they were unable to get care due to a misunderstanding of what the program covers, and when that coverage becomes available. They had a cardiac condition for which they had filed a disability claim and were trying to seek preventative care while the claim was ongoing. We are aware that the disability claims process can often take an extended period of time, and they didn’t understand why they were not able to get coverage in the interim. \
 \
P7: “I said, well, that's not what FMP is for. It's for anything because I'm residing in a foreign country. So, anyway, not having to blame belabor the point, it was just very frustrating to get a straight answer from anybody.” \
 \
This misunderstanding seems to have originated in a lack of clarity in terms of how the FMP functions and interacts with the status of service-connected conditions and claims. As a result, the participant grew frustrated and gave up attempting to seek coverage through the FMP. \
 \
P7: “And to this day I never got anything sorted out, and I just kinda gave up.”


### Additional Insight 2: Misunderstanding FMP scope

P4 has been trying to understand the FMP so that they can move to Portugal. They have a condition that requires a specific temperature-sensitive medication. In their efforts, they have reached out to the “Travel Office” and seem unaware of their options for utilizing FMP through local providers. 


P4: “They'll send things there, but they won't send things any place else you have to travel like. If I went to Portugal, I'd have to go to Spain once a month and get all my medications. Well, that's crazy.” \
 \
In this scenario, the Veteran is completely delaying their plans, potentially because of a fundamental misunderstanding of programs and a potential lack of communication between different parts of the VA. \
 \
P4: “Yeah. And I need to make sure it's solid. You know, I can't go over there and them saying things are working. And then, all of a sudden, things don't work. And there I am. It's you know. I've gotta know they're gonna work.”


### Additional Insight 3: Provider Interactions

Some of the users explained that they were not interacting with FMP directly at all and were instead using the organization's services to register and file claims on their behalf. Concern had been expressed in the past about this situation, which prompted a desire for additional investigation and preservation of the information in order to pass it on to stakeholders so they can better understand how providers are interacting with Veterans regarding the FMP.



* P5: "I try to see doctors - We're in a unique situation with FMP - that, you know, all of my doctors where I live directly bill FMP for the most part."
* P13: Yeah, [my provider is] the one that made me aware of [FMP]. You know, I wasn't really aware of the Foreign Medical Program before them."
* To provide some context P13 elaborates on what services their preferred provider offers in Colombia: 
    * The provider initiates and submits claims for service and connected disabilities.
    * They coordinate medical appointments related to the claims process.
    * They assist veterans and dependents in the enrollment process for eligible educational benefits.
    * They assist in the fiduciary application process.
    * They assist in housebound or aid and attendance application process.
    * They assist survivors and access accessing entitled benefits
    * They provide detailed guidance and assistance with burial benefits.
    * They ave VSOs on staff to assist Veterans

## **Recommendations**


### **Recommendation 1: Consider implementing or exploring design solutions for the following:**
   * Explain what the VA will use phone number, address, and email address for so users are able choose the right ones for them; many Veterans overseas have more than one of each.
   * Add helper text to the VA file number field explaining what it is and who has one. This will reduce confusion for Veterans who do not have VA file number.
   * On the review page, expand all the accordions or just lay out all the information on one page with no accordions.
   * Continue allowing users to edit in-line on the review page.
   * Add country code to the phone number, and remove limits on the number of numbers and the format.
   * If possible, customize addresses for each country or include extra lines for foreign  countries.
   * Add copy explaining that information input on the FMP forms will only affect their information with the FMP, and not the VA at large.
### **Recommendation 2: Provide Veterans with more self-service or automated outlets to receive the status of their interactions with the VA, information about the program, and how to communicate.**
   * It can take 3-6 months before Veterans hear anything about their claim or receive a check, and they only receive that communication if they reach out to the VA.
   * Consider allowing Veterans to access information on the status of their claims and registration through MyHealtheVet - some expect to look there anyway.
   * Implement email, phone calls, and/or text notifications when Veterans’ claims and registrations have been received or move on to a new stage of processing.
### **Recommendation 3: Continue exploring options to expedite processing and working closely with stakeholders to ensure the digitization effort is utilized to the fullest extent possible to improve the overall experience.**
   * Notably, the only participant with FMP benefits who didn’t express this frustration receives all their care at a provider (explored in Additional Insight 3), and they handle all of the care and payments for them. That participant said that if they moved somewhere where that provider wasn’t available to them, they wouldn’t know how to go about using FMP.
   * When Veterans submit their own claims, they feel they must be meticulous in their documentation to ensure their claim is paid. Reimbursement for medication can also be difficult because many overseas pharmacies don’t provide the information that the VA requires to process the claim. This can lead to Veterans giving up entirely on reimbursement in those scenarios.
   * Mailing delays are built into Veterans’ expectations about reimbursement timeframes, but they are still frustrated by the turnaround time. Some Veterans have reimbursement checks sent to their foreign addresses, but mail can be unreliable and take months to arrive. Others have their checks sent to friends or family members based in the US, who send the Veterans photos of the checks so the Veteran can cash them.
   * Consider some of the recommended content and flow changes to the form that help make claim requirements clearer and immediately available when the veteran interacts with the form.
### **Recommendation 4: Communicate findings and scenarios with stakeholders, continue moving the form in a Veteran-centric direction, and help the business understand the dynamics of the user experience with FMP as it pertains to providers so that they can take appropriate action.**
   * One additional participant mentioned they wished they could find providers that would do so.
   * The participants who interacted with providers to register for the program and handle claims seemed to have a much more favorable impression of the program overall. This is likely due to the additional burden of filing and the risk of lengthy reimbursement time being taken on by these providers.
### **Recommendation 5: Move forward with content improvements to the form and flow that will help to better inform users about the FMP. Look for opportunities in the VA.gov ecosystem that provide additional outlets to share information about FMP and connect other potential touchpoints to that information when the Veteran encounters them.**
   * Frustrations were expressed concerning the misunderstandings about program benefits and eligibility, often leading to scenarios where the Veteran decided to stop pursuing care or never attempted to in the first place. The perceived lack of communication from the FMP exacerbated these problems.
   * When Veterans register themselves, they don’t know how long it will take to hear back. One participant based in the UK mentioned that they tried to register for FMP in 2020 but never heard back. They are unsure if they have FMP benefits, but they haven’t pursued them because they receive care on a nearby base.
   * Consider changes to the content page to outline the FMP benefits more concisely.
   * Consider adding content about FMP’s coverage and exceptions when working on the claims form.
### **Recommendation 6: Provide clarification around what addresses and phone numbers will be used for.**
   * Veterans understood that a home address was their current residence and a mailing address was where they wanted to receive mail - for FMP, specifically, their reimbursement checks.
   * Veterans mentioned having at least two mailing addresses and phone numbers but didn't know how to inform FMP which one to use in a specific scenario without filing an entirely new form or calling FMP. They wouldn’t know how to go back and retrieve their submitted form.
   * Some Veterans mentioned having at least two different mailing addresses and phone numbers but didn't know how to inform FMP which one to use in a specific scenario without filing an entirely new form or calling FMP. They wouldn’t know how to go back and retrieve their submitted form.


## **Next Steps**

* Provide details of findings to the team and discuss next actions.
* Share information relevant to the program and potentially actionable with stakeholders.
   * Give stakeholders information on provider interactions and continue the discussion on how best to interface with or manage provider interactions to improve the Veteran's experience.
   * Does the FMP have a process in place for handling beneficiaries that change their location frequently?
   * Are you comfortable providing a rough timeline to expect a response in the confirmation?
* Make content modifications based on the observed interactions.
* Investigate potential solutions for problems that need design input once they are prioritized.
* Continue to work with stakeholders on interim solutions to give beneficiaries more visibility into the status of their claims and registration.
* Continue pursuing opportunities to enhance the outreach capabilities, eligibility requirements clarity, and required claims submission documentation through OCTOs capabilities and VA.gov.


## **Further research needed**

Research should continue moving forward to address the usability of the form over time, ideally with a more robust prototype or live version of the form. In parallel with that research, user behaviors, perceptions, and pain points should also continue to be explored in order to help optimize the service and improve the overall experience of Veterans interacting with the FMP.
