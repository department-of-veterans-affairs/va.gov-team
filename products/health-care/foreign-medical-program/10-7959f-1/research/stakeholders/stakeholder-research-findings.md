# 10-7959f-1 (FMP Registration) Stakeholder Research Findings

## Foreign Medical Program (FMP) OKRs and KPIs

* Claims to be adjudicated: Target - 45 days 
    * Average time for adjudication - 125 days
* Claims to be processed: Target - 90% within 45 days
    * Average 120 days - 20k pending
* Applications to be processed: Target - 90% within 30 days
    * No backlog
* Registrations complete: Target: 3 to 3.5 per hour
* Backlog burndown: Target - 403 daily
    * Current 446 - Increased output by processing submissions by Veteran instead of first-come-first-serve basis
* Goal to eliminate the backlog by the end of the fiscal year
    * Reduced workload capacity is a cause for concern in meeting this goal
* All metrics above are tracked by supervisors and deputies daily and reported to chiefs on a monthly basis.

### Stakeholder Comments

* P1: "We track KPIs on a regular basis and normally brief them monthly to our leadership team. Again, enrollments are new to that process."

### Recommendations

* Continue to align our objectives with reducing the processing time and lowering error rates for applications and claims through digitizing forms, processes, and the service design work that informs those changes.

## **Finding 1**: Documents often come in by mail but can be sent by email (especially from the Philippines), fax, and AskVA.



* Emails sometimes take longer than mailing things because the email must be printed and scanned into the system. 
* Many emails must be translated, which adds time (especially if it’s not a common language).
* Many emails come from the Philippines, and often in large batches.


### Stakeholder Comments



* P4: “It actually takes us longer to process a claim that came through email than if it comes in paper.”
* P1: [The applicant] assumed that he was already enrolled in the FMP program. When we checked this information, we said, hey, you are not currently enrolled in the program. But, we as a department would just go ahead and enroll him, based on the email…[but] we would still require that form for backfill.”
* P3: "There could be anywhere from 1 to 20 registrations per email, and we probably receive upwards of 10 emails per week, and that's specifically the Philippines."


### Recommendations



* Publicize and redirect to the digitized registration form. This may reduce the volume of emails and decrease processing time and burden.
* Consider exploring existing automation for translation through VA.Gov services and how that can be used through our form (and potentially the claims form in the future?) to avoid this situation entirely.
* Continue to research existing products or services through our collaborations at OCTO to help facilitate better communication and outreach. VA Notify is still an excellent example of how we may be able to partner with other teams or utilize other products at VA/OCTO to increase outreach for the programs where we are involved in the digitization effort. 


## **Finding 2**: The lack of electronic funds transfers (EFTs) is a significant pain point.



* One of the biggest complaints FMP hears is that they don’t do EFT - they only pay by paper check, specifically US Treasury Checks.
    * This is a significant bottleneck because the Treasury takes 7-15 days to cut a check. Then, the check has to be mailed, which takes additional time and might be misdelivered if foreign addresses aren’t appropriately put in the system.
        * The system limits address lines to 30 characters, so sometimes FMP has to guess how to abbreviate things.
    * After a long wait, progress is finally being made on implementing EFT.


### Stakeholder Comments



* P1: “There is a lot of frustration for [the lack of] direct deposit of a payment into an account. We pay by paper check. That’s the primary reason we need the payment address and, of course, the banking information.”


### Recommendations



* Continue to collaborate with the stakeholders on their vision and execution for enabling EFT capabilities. Look for opportunities where the form digitization effort or service insights can help as we learn more.


## **Finding 3**: Automation and digitization would significantly decrease processing time and errors.



* Handwriting can be hard to read.
* Scan quality might be poor.
* All received mail is routed with bubble sheets, and there are errors all the time - they might be mismarked or misread by the machine and routed inappropriately. Sometimes, it takes days to discover these errors. 
* Data has to be manually entered from the scan of the paper form into VISTA, which leaves room for typos.
* You have to abbreviate the service-connected conditions because of character count limitations. Not everyone abbreviates the same way.
* Data has to be manually transferred and checked between VIS, VBMS, and VISTA.
* Service-connected conditions have to be manually grouped by date and type - this adds extra burden.
* The only way to know what the Veteran will see is by printing out the letter - you can’t see a preview in any VA systems.
* There are concerns over lost documents in the process, leading to failed claims or applications. 


### Stakeholder Comments



* P1: “We are primarily losing those documents between us and the post office or between us and the scan process.”


### Recommendations



* To reduce error rates and processing time, look for more opportunities to eliminate or work around swivel chair interactions or paper processes. Based on the research, these are the areas in which the forms digitization effort could potentially have the most impact.
* An excellent example of the type of potential opportunities we are looking for lies in the character limits for VISTA. In the future, we should recommend that the information we push from the form to PEGA be the new source of truth for addresses, service-connected disabilities, etc., to circumvent the confusion that VISTA causes with abbreviations. To do this, we will need to ensure that the information we collect meets the business’ standards and communicate successfully to PEGA where it needs to go or what additional functionality will be needed to facilitate their process (In this example, we are going to need to make sure that PEGA can produce the letter with the pre-populated information or pass that info over to the printer application). 


## **Finding 4:** The VA already has all the information a Veteran needs to complete an application - it’s just located in disparate systems that don't talk to each other.



* In an ideal world, FMP wouldn’t need a registration form at all because the systems (VIS, VBMS, and VISTA) could talk to each other.
* Veterans would be automatically registered as soon as they have a service-connected condition - the Veteran wouldn’t have to do anything at all.
* Much of the stakeholder sentiment aligned with what was expressed in previous stakeholder research around ensuring that current in-development systems are being designed to work together and in a way that they can successfully replace or work around legacy systems and antiquated processes down the line.


### Stakeholder Comments



* P2: "Old processes and technology. Technology is built layer upon layer, like paint. You just paint over stuff, but the thing you're painting is what needs to be replaced, the system itself." (In response to the question: What do you believe the biggest problem we are trying to solve for applicants through this program is?) 
* P2: “System interfaces, having a modern process replace something that is existing. How do we take all the information that we have that is in this static legacy system, Vista-based, and migrate it to somewhere modern and ensure that what you’re doing is synced with whatever’s benign done here to modernize eligibility?” (When asked: Are there any constraints that you can think of that might be issues for us when we’re digitizing 10-7959f-1?)


### Recommendations



* In the future, consider how we can assist in the effort to auto-enroll Veterans in the FMP and eliminate the need for the registration form.
* An example of how this could work moving forward is by identifying the plans and gaps through continued investigation and passing on recommendations to teams working on projects that can facilitate this change, sharing collected insights, and assisting where we may be able to affect change directly.


## **Finding 5:** Stakeholders want more transparency around the program, both in terms of awareness and decision-making.



* Some Veterans feel like FMP is a black hole - specifically, whether they choose to reimburse or not. However, FMP says they’ll pay for any claim related to a service-connected condition.
* Leaders have done a podcast, and there are also existing YouTube videos. They want to do more videos for the SITREP YouTube channel.
* A few stakeholders mentioned they wished they had a portal or dashboard so veterans could see the status of their claims. This would cut down claims to the call center and Congressional inquiries.


### Stakeholder Comments



* P4: “I feel this program needs a lot more outreaches. It has gone away for maybe the last 8 years.”
* P4: “Allowing the veterans or providers the opportunity to check the status of claims would be a huge [improvement].”


### Recommendations



* Consider adding the Veteran’s email to the form, emailing Veterans when their registration has been added or claim has been processed.


## **Finding 6:** Stakeholders are concerned about fraud, particularly from providers.



* Some participants expressed concern about fraud committed by providers since FMP is known for their generous reimbursement policy. 


### Stakeholder Comments



* P4: “With FMP, people know we will pay whatever they bill us.”
* P1: “There has been quite a bit of frustration over the years that Veterans or providers send in claims where medication is outrageously charged or priced overseas." 


### Recommendations



* Both the business and design should look for opportunities to limit the risk of fraud, especially when expanding into the digital space where exposure is likely to grow. Moving forward, this will become more relevant concerning any work we do around claims, and it is important to keep this in mind.
* An example of where this may come into play is working with the business to establish warning signs of potential fraud (medication over a certain dollar amount) and flagging those in the metadata so that clerks are less likely to miss them and fail to take appropriate action.
