**The Problem**

The Veteran and Family Member Programs (VFMP) team at the VA manages medical programs for Veterans and their families, such as the Foreign Medical Program (FMP). Through our ongoing stakeholder research and service blueprinting efforts, the IVC team has discovered that the VFMP team relies on multiple systems that do not talk to each other: Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS), Veterans Information System (VIS), and Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VISTA). VBMS and VIS are both VBA systems – they house the Veteran’s personal information, eligibility, service connected disability, documentation and other details.
VA analysts and others who are processing forms for The Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA) and FMP must go back and forth between these systems to check data and manually enter information to process every registration and claim, often typing out the information because they’re unable to copy and paste between systems. They are also forced to abbreviate and manually organize important information, such as Veterans’ service-connected conditions, due to artificial technical constraints from these outdated systems. This causes confusion and errors for both VA analysts and Veterans.

**Opportunity**

More research is needed, but at the very least there should be a back end integration between the VISTA, VBMS, and VIS so that the information is pulled in without manual inputs, which leads to room for error and delays in processing. Note: VES (Veterans Enrollment System) will eventually be able to handle CHAMPVA and Foreign Medical Program forms, but the scope is not defined yet. There is an opportunity for the IVC Forms team to work with the new team that will be working on this integration to help identify pain points and use cases, along with areas of opportunity (specifically with research and design support).

**Who do you think this would this help?**

Improvements to the system architecture would help supervisory analysts, analysts and others who are processing forms. It would help reduce the amount of swivel-chair processing between systems, leading to faster processing with fewer errors. It will also ultimately help Veterans because their claims and applications will be processed more quickly and with fewer errors.
