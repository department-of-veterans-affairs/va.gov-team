- Stanley Nelson - program management supervisor analyst 
- Andrea Bingham - deputy
- Other attendees: Brian Wilke, Rachael Penfil, Premal Shah, Mary Wang

FMP and VFMP (Veteran and Family member programs - higher level portfolio)
High level overview: 
- Registration - singular and for life - updates can occur later on (separate)
- Overseas or potentially going and has service related disability
- User hits submit, trigger for Jen’s team (VISTA/CP&E database entered manually)
- Info just sits there - static
- If they fill out the form and don’t have service related connections with VBA, it will get rejected (user should do this prior to sending this for reimbursement)
- only meant to treat service related disabilities

Claims cover sheet:
- Does not apply to territories (PR, Guam, American Samoa) - not applicable
- Duration doesn’t matter (1 day), medical tourism (flying to DR), also expatriates (ex: came off active duty in Germany)
- Global in nature
- Possible scenario: could maybe submit a claim form (use claim form to get them registered - if look in CP&E and don’t see it)

VR&E (Veteran Readiness and Employment):
- actively enrolled/participating with case manager, cover medical treatments beyond service related disabilities
- provide services only if they’re required to run the program (if related to teeth and need to get a job, etc.)
- case manager may say dental treatment is needed (substantiated from case manager)
- This would be a minority
- They may also submit a claim on a form and are not in the system - have to go in and look (in VBMS and VIS) and will fwd on and issue denial letter if info is not there

Volume of applicants: 
- service disabled veterans traveling overseas 
- Pending queue - FMP registration (High of 42 or low of 2 - avg 20s and 30s)
- Total of 822 that need to be processed in paper
- Avg processing time - really depends (2.5-3 an hour) some are quick, others can take an hour (depends on amount of service connected conditions)

CP&E:
- has to be done by oldest - newest date
- conditions also have to be grouped together because there is limited amount of space
- Can we have VBMS (Veterans Benefits Mgt system - case management system for VBA) or VIS talk to VES?
- (VIS is not the same as VBMS - need to make sure the systems are matching up)
- Both VBA programs have to verify the info
