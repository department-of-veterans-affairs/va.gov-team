Feb 14, 2024 | FMP Stakeholder QA 
Attendees: Jennifer Rivera, Andrew Szymczak, Rachael Penfil, Brian Wilke, Premal Shah, Mary Wang

Jen and Andrew are the SMEs
- Limitations to where we can send checks - diplomatic issues
  - Russia, Cuba, North Korea, Iran. But it’s not live - there is no permanent state department liaison. There’s a policy around it but Andrew has to find it.
  - But Veterans can get reimbursed pretty much anywhere. Has been a source of contention. Minority population.

- If a Veteran was to change citizenship - doesn’t matter to the program. They will keep FMP eligibility.
- They get a lot of duplicate registrations
- Hard to get exact numbers for registration
- Dashboards made up of excel spreadsheets - things not completed by date, they update them daily
- Premal seeking counts of registrations/claims - they will send us a spreadsheet with PII redacted
- Jen showing us the process w an email that came through from the Philippines 
  - Pull up registration form
  - File number/SSN check in Vista. That didn’t work, so go to VBMS.
  - Put in their social in VBMS and compare to make sure name matches, DOB matches
  - Then take the social and put it in VIS. Then check name and DOB again.
  - Then go to C&P in VIS to check disabilities (tab). They’re all by numbers - you have to hover over or click them to see what the code means.
  - So, go back to Vista and check their name to make sure it’s not a duplicate. Still not found, so go back and copy social from VBMS. 
  - Then need to create a new file. Paste in SSN, then create a new file. If they have a different file number, add that in too. 
  - To add in address, go back to registration form. If it’s domestic, enter it. Go by whatever they put on the form, NOT what is in VBMS. Use physical address first, - then the system will ask if you want a different “remit to” (mailing) address
     - If it’s a foreign address, it’s hard to know how to format things properly, or there might be particularities that they don’t know how to enter
  - Same kind of things with phone number
  - Can be errors from handwriting - have to guess sometimes
  - Have to enter Ch 31, which they pull from VBMS
    - Then go enter their conditions, which they have to shorten because of character counts. Use oldest date for Ch 31, then the date that the info was entered, and where they got the info from (VBM)
  - Then their service connected conditions. VIS has the most updated information, so they use that as much as possible. Go in order of beginning date - oldest to newest
    - Can't cut and paste from VIS to Vista, because of character count
    - Use Most current award effective date from VIS, and also say they got it from VIS
  - If it’s an email from the Philippines, they need to get a copy of the acceptance letter. Also automatically send it to the mail room to mail out. 
  - Add comments - registration request received via email. Input SC’s and sent/emailed accept. Also added if they “reg to CRM docs (because it was sent via email and there’s no record in the system) -> go into DAPER, then CRM docs, grab social from VBMS, paste.
    - Browse saved files - then add enrollment request, and submit. Then copy the timestamp to show it’s in the system now, add timestamp to Vista 
  - For Philippines, mail it to VAMC there too
  - Then have to change the name of the file they sent to the printer to the Veteran’s name, and then when you open the file they can see the letter that will be sent to the Veteran. 
  - Then save the letter, and once they go through all the letters from the same email, will send and email with all the confirmation letters back to the Philippines to confirm
  - Phillipines emails always happen, if they have emails for Veterans can do that directly (but it doesn’t always happen). The letters don’t technically have PHI or PII - service connected conditions are there, but they’re emailed encrypted, so it’s okay
- VIS and VBMS are both VBA (Veterans Benefits Administration)  websites. They can access them but not change anything in them.
  - Information might be all over the place, dates out of order, conditions out of order, condition numbers might not be easy to decode… lots to deal with. E.g., right and left aren’t always together.
  - You end up having to be really careful for how you group like items
  - Pull up CRM
- Don’t care about %age of disability rating, just care if it’s service connected OR Ch 17. If it’s not service connected or Ch 17, it’s not covered
- Ch 17 isn’t common but it does happen - Ch 17 - treatment purposes only (need to figure out how that’s different than not Ch 17). But FMP will pay for it.
- For effective date, use most recent rating decision (don’t have to deal with a whole history)
- Jenn can get 3-5 enrollments done an hour, depending on how many conditions they have.
- Employees try to get at least 3 an hour, gives you some room to deal with the convoluted ones
- Would be AWESOME if VES can talk to Vista, VBMS, VIS - that would save so much time/data
- DAPER - can tell by page count (more than 2 have claims attached almost guaranteed)
- Go through each of the letters - sometimes for other teams (might send over to another team to help the Veteran with their questions)
- A lot of time claim cover sheet - verify the info, address - if it’s medical claim, email medical claim team to process
  - Go into VBMS and VIS - vocational rehab (y/n), make sure all service connected conditions are included (make sure each one is listed and not missed)
