In the context of forms or subtask flows, sub-urls are distinct from the base URL and usually point to questions or tasks within a larger flow.
Teams can choose their own sub-urls, or get help from CAIA in choosing them or vetting them.

Note some standard sub-urls:
- /introduction: use on the first page of the actual form (not the static page in drupal)
- /review OR /review-and-submit: use for review steps in forms or tools
- /results: use to display the results of a tool (not usually used in a form)
- /confirmation: use for the confirmation page after form submission

Subtask URL slugs should be short, plain language, and drawn from the H1 if possible.
Reminder: Donâ€™t create unnecessary or empty subdirectories when creating sub-URLs!
