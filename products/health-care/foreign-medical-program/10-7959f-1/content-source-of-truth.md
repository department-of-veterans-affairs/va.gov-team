{subtitle} Foreign Medical Program (FMP) Registration Form (VA Form 10-7959f-1)


#### [H2] About the Foreign Medical Program (FMP)

If you’re a Veteran who gets medical care outside the U.S. for a service-connected condition, we may cover the cost of your care. Read this page to find out how the Foreign Medical Program (FMP) works and how to register.


#### [H2] Eligibility for coverage through FMP

If you get medical care in a country outside the U.S., we can only cover the cost of services that are medically necessary to treat these 3 types of conditions:



* Health care services, medications, and durable medical equipment for service-connected conditions and conditions associated with and held to be aggravating a service-connected condition, **or**
* Conditions that are associated with a service-connected disability and that we determine make the disability worse (or “aggravate” it). For example, if you have a service-connected condition of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), we may cover the cost of care for non-service-connected depression because the depression can be associated with PTSD and make it worse.
* If you participate in our [Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) program](https://www.va.gov/careers-employment/vocational-rehabilitation/) (also known as 38 U.S.C. Chapter 31; formerly known as the VA Vocational Rehabilitation Program), we may pay for care for other conditions.

You can only use FMP for care you get in a foreign country. We don’t cover care or supplies you get in or from the U.S. or U.S. territories.

We pay claims by U.S. Treasury check. If you get care in a country outside the U.S. that can’t accept U.S. Treasury checks, you’ll need to find another way to cash these checks.


#### [H2] How to register for FMP

Veterans can use Form 10-7959f-1 to register in the VA Foreign Medical Program (FMP).
