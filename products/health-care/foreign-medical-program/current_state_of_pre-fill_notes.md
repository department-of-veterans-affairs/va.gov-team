# Pre-fill Notes 


## Current State



* Launch F1 without Pre-fill
* F2 launch is further down the road. Expected to launch with Pre-fill.
* Different teams are using Pre-fill in various ways and adapting the pattern to suit their applications needs
* The AE team is researching the current patterns to improve and make them consistent. They are asking these questions: 
    * Are the alerts the right way to go or will it add to alert fatigue?
    * What types of info should we/ can we pre-fill depending on the the level of authorization the applicant has
    * Researching editable vs locked
    * Researching different types of users (veterans, sponsors, dependents, claimant) and what types of info gets prefilled and the language needed for that
