# Foreign Medical Program (FMP) Service Design Artifacts
Last updated August 30, 2024

These artifacts were created with findings from user interviews and stakeholder interviews. They represent both FMP registration (10-7959f-1) and FMP claims (10-7959f-2).

## Artifacts

- A journey map is a visualization of the process that a person goes through to accomplish a goal. This user journey details the time between Veterans discovering the program through registration and Veterans receiving reimbursement for claims.

- A service blueprint is a diagram that visualizes the relationships between different service components — people, props (physical or digital evidence), and processes — that are directly tied to touchpoints in a specific customer or user journey. This service blueprint details the time between FMP sharing information about the program through registration and Veterans receiving reimbursement for claims.

## Methodology

### User journey
1. Conduct stakeholder research to gain a preliminary understanding of major steps in the user journey, user pain points, and other details.
2. Conduct user research with the aim of understanding the journey from the user's point of view, including what is and isn't working about the currect processes within the program and form.

3. Analyze the results of user research to identify common themes.

4. Create the user journey, which can be iterated upon through additional rounds of user research, site feedback, and analytics.
 

### Service Blueprint
1. Perform discovery and gather as much information about the program and Veteran journey as possible.
2. Conduct stakeholder interviews aimed at informing the user journey, identifying employee processes, and understanding which people and systems are involved in each stage of the those processes.
