# Engineering Lead Meetings

## Problem

OCTO Health Engineering needs to have ownership and a voice on all health apps on va.gov, but can not be around for every decision and the day and day work.

## Solution

 Establish a Engineering Leads meeting with each area of practice to review and discuss technical direction, blockers, and culture. This should be a recurring meeting with each team/app sends a designated engineering lead to represent them.

## Process

- Identify a team engineering contractor leader for each product team
- Establish periodic sync. Keep it fluid and feel free to change that if things are going on
  - This is the place to steer the tech culture and set expectations
  - Make it clear that even though OCTO is responsibly for the quality of code and product, that also falls on them as the lead to ensure quality
  - This is the place to raise blockers and get help from OCTO
- Use this time to discuss technical direction and architecture decisions
- Use this time to discuss SRE and reliability concerns
- This should not be a status meeting.

## Rough Agendas

- Any Hot Topics from the day
- Announcements from OCTO
- Chat about any outstanding issues/questions
- Upcoming Risks to be aware of
- Open Floor
