# Contractor as Lead Model

## Problem

OCTO Engineering needs to have ownership and a voice on all va.gov teams, but can not be around for every decision and the day and day work.

## Solution

Lean on a contractor lead/senior/trusted engineer and keeps them in lock step as a proxy to the team and team direction

## Process

- Identify a good person on the team to be your proxy
- Establish 1on1 periodic sync, weekly to start, then shift to biweekly. Keep it fluid and feel free to change that if things are going on
  - This is the place to steer the tech culture and set expectations
  - Make it clear that even though OCTO is responsibly for the quality of code and product, that also falls on them as the lead to ensure quality
- Be active on PR review process.
  - Start off making your approval be required.
- Ceremonies that OCTO engineer should go to
  - Sprint planning
  - Sprint Demo
  - Team Product Sync
  - OCTO Product Sync

## Notes

- standards and metrics are very useful
- Documents are good action items for the proxy
- There flexibility built in to be more/active while needed.
- In practice, this should be around 10-25% of the OCTO engineers time.
