# Documentation Audit Scope of Work

In order to improve stakeholder visibility and collaboration between engineering teams, standardized documentation  for all APIs that power MHV on va.gov should be available in a centralized location. This includes the following APIs:

- Medical Records
- Secure Messaging
- Medications
- Account Activity Log
- Session API

This should reflect what is currently being developed and how the team operates. This is not an exercise in iterating on the current process but a documentation of where we are today. We accept that some of these documents need to be created and/or updated. There is also a real chance that a bunch of these exist, but they are not easily findable. This will be a cross-team effort to locate, update, create, and/or align the documentation.

## The Tickets Needed for this PI

- [SPIKE] Audit the current documentation, including seeing what is already created and what needs to be updated and then move to a centralized location
- [DOCUMENTATION] Create what is missing
- [DOCUMENTATION] Update if any documents are out of date

## Required Documentation

- Technical Diagrams and Documentation:
  - **README**: A detailed README with who owns the code, relevant links and information to give engineers a place to get started.
  - **Architecture Diagrams:** Preferably in C4 model style or another clear format, illustrating system design, tech stack (with versions), and external dependencies.
  - **Database Diagrams:** Visual representation of database architecture and relationships.
  - **Sequence Diagrams:** for core features, detailing how data and/or users navigate both happy path and failure points.
  - **Network Diagram:** Comprehensive diagram of the production environment's network architecture.
  - **OpenAPI (Swagger) Documentation:** Detailed API documentation for all APIs consumed by VA.gov.
  - **CI/CD Pipeline Documentation:**
        Overview of the CI/CD pipeline process.
        Step-by-step guide for deploying code to production with and without CD automation.

- Operation Guides:
  - **Feature Release Process Guide:**
        End-to-end workflow for releasing new features, including ticket creation, PR, staging, production deployment, rollout, and monitoring.
  - **Developer Environment Setup Guide:**
        Instructions for setting up a development environment as independent of specific individuals as possible.
        Bonus: Include instructions for running the application in a container (e.g., Docker) and locally.
  - **Troubleshooting Guide:**
        A detailed process for diagnosing and resolving issues, including:
            Overview of monitoring tools and their use for everyday triage tasks.
            Guidance on accessing logs, stack traces, and system health checks.
            Contact information for external system dependency issues.
  - **Disaster Recovery Documentation:**
        Steps for setting up a new MHV API *production* environment from scratch.

## Quality and Compliance Standards

All documentation should follow the guidelines established by the Office of the CTO Engineering team and be structured following the standards set for VA.gov documentation. The final deliverables must be uploaded to the MHV Developer Documentation repository (see "Where and how to store" section below for URL). An OCTO engineer should approve and review all documents early and often.

For Diagrams, look at the [diagram standards](./document-standards.md).

For operation guide, look at the [operations standards](./operations-guide-standards.md).

Note that these are just starting points and are subject to iteration and adjustments as we improve the documentation.

## Where and how to store

- All documents should live in the developer docs repo: <https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/mhv-developer-docs>. We will create a subfolder per API under a `documentation` folder. The artifacts created should live in:
  - `/technical-documentation/secure-messaging`
  - `/technical-documentation/medical-records`
  - `/technical-documentation/medications`
  - etc...
- Beyond being in the API folder, the structure is up to the team. This main goal is to have a centralized location for all documentation and address any missing information.
- All documents should be Github flavor markdown.
  - diagrams should ideally be created with [mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) inline in the documentation, or embedded images when not practical.
