# [WIP] Triage Playbooks

- Every product team should maintain a triage playbook that outlines the steps to be taken when issues arise.
- The playbook should be easily accessible to all team members and updated regularly.
- It should include contact information for key team members, escalation paths, and predefined responses for common issues.
- The playbook should also detail the monitoring tools in use, alerting thresholds, and procedures for incident response.
- After an incident, the playbook should be reviewed and updated based on lessons learned to improve future responses.
- The playbook should be integrated into the team's onboarding process to ensure all members are familiar with it.
- Assume the bus factor: ensure that multiple team members are familiar with the playbook and system and can execute it if needed.

## Samples

> These are only samples to get you started. Please customize for your team's needs. The only requirement is that you playbook covers the necessary information for triaging incidents effectively.
