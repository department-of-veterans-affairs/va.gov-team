## Flyers

Each PDF flyer has the same content but different portraits. Please use whichever flyer best reflects the audience you’re engaging or wish to engage. 

Flyers can also be printed as posters. 

We recommend placing flyers/posters in highly visible locations, such as COVID-19 vaccination waiting areas and staff break rooms, and areas frequented by women Veterans, such as women’s clinics and mobile mammogram units.
