## Countdown to 1 Million Campaign Toolkit

**What is MVP:** The Million Veteran Program (MVP) is a national research program to learn how genes, lifestyle, and military exposures affect health and illness. Since launching in 2011, over 865,000 Veterans have joined MVP, making it one of the world’s largest programs on genetics and health.

**Campaign goal:** MVP aims to enroll its one millionth Veteran in FY23. It will be the first research program in the world with 1,000,000 people, greatly advancing the ability to study genetics and health in the Veteran population. Ultimately, MVP research can lead to advancements in the identification, treatment and prevention of disease on an individual, or personalized, basis.

**You can help us reach this historic milestone.** Use the materials in this toolkit to spread the word about MVP among Veterans, family, friends, and advocates:

1. [Digital advertisements (for VAMC televisions and digital screens)](#digital-ads-for-vamc-televisions-and-digital-screens)
2. [Posters](#posters)
3. [One-pager](#one-pager)
4. [Social media toolkit](#social-media-toolkit)
5. [Social media graphics](#social-media-graphics)
6. [Other content (articles, news releases, podcasts, etc.)](#other-content)

For outreach to women Veterans, you can also use these tailored materials from MVP’s women’s campaign. Materials include posters, videos, social media, blogs, a one-pager, and more.

Questions? Contact Jennifer.Deen@va.gov or Claudia.Gutierrez@va.gov. Thank you for your help!

### Digital ads for VAMC televisions and digital screens

Below are two advertisements that can be used on digital screens in elevators, way-finding screens around the hospital, and televisions located in the waiting rooms.

#### Digital ad for all VAMCs:

This can be used by any VAMC whether or not they have an MVP clinic (it directs Veterans to join online at mvp.va.gov).

Non-customizable digital ads:

#### Customizable ad for VAMCs with an MVP Clinic:

If your facility has an MVP clinic ([you can check here](https://www.research.va.gov/mvp/all-clinics.cfm)), please add the MVP clinic location directly to the PPT slide (i.e., floor and room number). It is not permissible to include local staff contact information (staff phone numbers/emails). Please be sure to resize the PPT to your display size requirements.

### Posters

Each PDF poster has the same content but is sized at three different dimensions. Please use whichever size best suits your outreach purposes. For VAMCs, we recommend placing posters in highly visible locations, such as lobbies, waiting areas, staff break rooms, women’s clinics, etc.

### Ad for VAMC televisions and digital screens

One is a customizable PowerPoint for VAMCs with local MVP clinics to include the location of the local MVP clinic (i.e., floor and room number).
