# Dec 15, 2023 | Placeholder: Review VA HE Release Plan with Patrick
- Attendees: Heather Justice Emily Brown Bateman, Patrick F.

### Notes
- Aggressive plan - letâ€™s slow it down a bit
- Would be more comfy at 10% with JF here, validating each submission for the first few days
- End of next week, dependent on all looking good (40-50 submissions), leave at 10% until we get back
     - If not all looks good, any hesitation? Turn it off
- Ramp up after New year

### Action items
- [x] Contact JF for availability and backups during phased release, specifically over holidays
- [ ] Confirm functionality of widget static page based on Feature Toggle with Matt L
- [ ] Confirm for static unpublishing team availability
- [ ] Discuss on Monday during Sync on updates, Go/No Go and HEC communications
