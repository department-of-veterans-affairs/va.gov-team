## Response from Joshua F/VES Technical Director
- This information is in response to the HEC stakeholders' desire to add a Service History question page to the online 10-10EZR, so that it matches the paper form.
- Joshua F has long been an advocate for not asking the Veteran for this information.  At the most, we should ask only for supporting docs (i.e. DD-214).

>Self reported service episode information is completely discarded from any automatic eligibility decisions made by the system, no matter if its from initial application or EZR.
>
>It is more important that they attach evidence of their service rather than simply responding to questions about it; it does not matter one bit how the military questions are answered from self-service, aside from just collecting those answers to see how they responded.
>
>If they are already verified to be a Veteran then a subsequent service period does not do anything to their PG aside from the case of possibly adding or extending their combat vet eligibility, which has nothing at all to do with the overall service period itself as it is dependent on combat locations/deployments/payments and those details are not even asked about.
>
>It has been my opinion for a long time that prompting to answer questions about their service dates is 100% pointless on the online application; they should only be made aware that it is in their best interest to attach the evidence of their service should it become necessary.
>
>In the authenticated flow you could actively retrieve the military info that VA has available via va profile/vadir and present that to them prior to submission.
>
>“Here is the military service info we have found on you, if this is correct you do not need to do anything further and just click submit”
>
>Or
>
>“We could not find any military service information on you. You must attach your military records to avoid delays in processing your application”.
