# Meeting notes for 7/7 meeting with HEC about military service on EZR

- **Currently on EZR**: we ask about toxic exposure but do not confirm or allow new service dates/times/branches to be added
- **Goal/Desired outcome**: Understand if HEC would like the questions related to service added that mimic the EZ questions

#### Attendees: Angela, Alex P., Heather, Renata, Josh
### Notes
- Wanted to revisit whether or not we need to add military service to the EZR. Currently, we ask Toxic Exposure questions, but no confirmation of military service dates, or ability to add new service dates/branches/etc.
     - **Alex/Heather** talked about it, and think that matching the EZ in terms of confirming existing military service and asking if the Veteran has new service dates to add (followed by uploading discharge papers)
- **Angela** says this would be perfect: let's not reinvent the wheel, let's mimic the existing pattern. There are other changes being implemented anyway that we'll have to design for.
### Questions
- **Angela**: isn't some of the application prefilled?
     - **Heather**: military history if available is prefilled on the EZ. The EZR prefills Veteran information, but we're adding some new data to prefill (EC/NOK), but the EZR current-state is just demographics.
     - **Angela**: Is there anything prefilled in EZ?
     - **Heather**: EZ prefills latest service history from VA Profile, plus demographics/contact information
     - **Josh**: EZR also prefills spouse, effective date, other basic info
     - **Alex**: Should we populate latest military info and ask "do you have more recent military service to add?"
     - **Renata**: That's consistent with the v2 confirmation flow, so it shouldn't be difficult
     - **Josh**: It might not be editable content, but we can present the information and ask
     - **Angela**: I like the prefill and show me what's already on the record. "This is what we currently have as your most recent military service. Do you have anything to add? YES/NO". I'd like it to also show if they've already selected TERA. A lot of our Veterans don't know what TERA is and then they find out about it and have to call to ask.
- **Josh**: Are we going to let them edit previous data, or just ADD new data?
     - **Angela**: I don't like the idea of letting them EDIT data. If they do that, it's going to affect priority group determination and more work for EED. Maybe add a line that's like "if you see anything incorrect, please call 877...." to update it. That way it doesn't go in the EED bucket, the call center agent can remedy the issue right away.
### Action items:
- **Alex** will meet with the team to map out this work and get situated
     - Initial design: Prefill latest military service, plus TERA yes/no (if feasible). Present a question asking if they have any new military service to add (yes/no). Make sure that prefill is not editable, but provide the HEC number if the Veteran notices anything wrong.
- **Provide** Angela a document where in one column everything that's prefilled for 1010EZ, and another column everything prefilled for 1010EZR (explain what's prefilled if authenticated vs. not)
     - Started a worksheet with columns. Will add copy here and send in email with these notes for Angela
