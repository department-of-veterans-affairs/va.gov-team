- DPRIS - Defense Personnel Records Information Retrieval System
     - Used to obtain documents such as DD-214 and DD-215

### Development
- 5/21/2024 - According to Joshua Faulkner, document attachment data is not exposed to the EE API and therefore cannot be accessed via requests.


### Testing
- 4/4/2024 - Do not use test address data if you want to update a user's mailing address via the EZR. VA profile actually tests the validity of addresses, so a valid address should be used.
     - Confirmed by Joshua Drumm when he used a Tampa Bay area Pizza Hut's address.
- 6/7/2024 - **REVIEW INSTANCE/STAGING ONLY:** In order to force the rendering of the `FormSaveErrorMessage` component, first open the dev tools in your browser whilst on the review page. Then, find `Application/local` `storage/csrfToken` and change it. Finally, submit the form. Component info: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/main/src/platform/forms/components/review/FormSaveErrorMessage.jsx
- 6/7/2024 - **REVIEW INSTANCE ONLY:** In order to display the error for when the `LOAD_STATUSES.clientFailure` (can't connect to the server) value is true, fill out a form until you reach the review page. Then, SSH into the review instance (instructions here: https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/using-review-instances-to-preview-changes#Usingreviewinstancestopreviewchanges-SSH), bash into the container by running `docker exec -it vetsapi_web_1 bash` , `docker ps`, and `docker stop vetsapi_web_1`. You can run `docker ps` again to ensure the container is no longer running. Finally, submit the form.

### Business Processes
- 9/7/2023 - Confirmation received from Joshua Faulkner
     - When the Enrollment System receives the submitted EZR, a generic email is triggered and sent to the email address within the form, stating that the submitted form has been received.
- 9/7/2023 - Confirmation received from Simone Gully and Ambroja Watson
     - EZR Processing is 5 business days.  Online submission _should_ be same day unless there is an error or inconsistency
     - Current process:
          - When the Priority Group (PG) changes, the VA health care handbook is sent with a letter insert on the change
          - If there is no change, there is no communication sent to the Veteran.
     - Future process (we will be notified when in place):
          - Any time the Priority Group (PG) changes or any determination is made regarding Priority Group and/or Copay status, a letter will be sent out notifying the Veteran of the change
 
### Miscellaneous
- 11-6-2023
     - Update on how ES would handle an EZR submitted within a current year that has already had a means test:
          - If there are less dependents on the EZR than on the current record
               - We need to test this to truly understand what will happen
               - Desired outcome: Any information that would impact the financial assessment/means test would be ignored.  The Veteran should only have one means test per income year (this is calendar year).
               - Future: We need to consider adding a check on E&E service to see if there is a means test already present in the current income year, and if there is, possibly preventing any info that could impact income from being updated. 
          - Insurance information can be updated any time, but Josh F is double checking on how multiple policies with adding/removing would work.
     - There is a caveat that the EZR service hasn't been used in about 8 years, and we may find out more on what actually happens during the end-to-end testing
