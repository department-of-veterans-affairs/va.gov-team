## Problem
- Veterans can currently view their Emergency Contacts and Next of Kin on the VA.gov profile page but cannot add, edit, or remove these contacts. Changes must be made through the 10-10EZR form.
- Relying on the 10-10EZR form for such updates is cumbersome and not user-friendly.
- Allowing these updates directly on the profile page will provide a more seamless and efficient experience for Veterans.

#### How does this initiative help further OCTO-DE's mission and goals? This initiative directly supports OCTO-DE's mission to deliver seamless, proactive, and personalized experiences by:
- Reducing veteran burden by allowing the action where the Veteran is, replacing the form for this simple action
- Building trust through improved experiences
- 2025 OCTO Priorities that this work will support:
     - Improve the Veteran login experience,
     - Integrate health portal features into VA.gov,
     - Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience,
     - Drive OIT’s Digital Transformation Strategy

## Discovery
### Assumptions/Risks

- **Value Risks** (will people use it): 
  - Will Veterans utilize the ability to add, edit, and remove their Emergency Contacts and Next of Kin?

- **Usability Risks** (can people figure out how to use it):
  - Will Veterans find the interface intuitive for managing their contacts?
  - Can we clearly communicate the purpose and importance of Emergency Contacts and Next of Kin information?

- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data):
  - Is the new VES Associations API fully stable and functional for production use?
  - Can the VA.gov profile page handle the integration and ensure real-time updates without performance degradation?
  - Will we encounter any issues related to data synchronization or reliability?

- **Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact):
  - Will we encounter resistance from either business partners in our attempt to eliminate this kind of update from a form

### What're you building
- In-Scope
     - Develop functionality to allow adding, editing, and removing Emergency Contacts and Next of Kin on the VA.gov profile page.
     - Enable error monitoring for interactions with the VES Associations API.

- Out of Scope
     - Changes to other sections of the profile page or other unrelated functionalities.

- Our solution will allow Veterans to enter their NoK online, and will include error monitoring for the new Associates API.
