## Problem
Veterans seeking healthcare do not have a means of indicating their gender identity, potentially influencing how and when they seek healthcare.  Including an option to allow Veterans to self-disclose their gender identity will give them a means of privately sharing this information with their healthcare team, ideally increasing the number of applicants.

## Desired User Outcomes
- Allow Veterans the option to disclose their gender identity
- Incrase comfort/trust with VA healthcare

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Confusion as to whether a user is required to share their gender identity
- Incorrect marking of gender identity

## Desired Business Outcomes
- More transparency and understanding of a Veteran's gender identity and the ability to use that to improve healthcare

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- Confusion on why the gender identity is an option
- Additional support calls to correct gender identities.

## Discovery
### Assumptions/Risks

- **Value Risks** (will people use it): 
  - The value risk is that Veterans may not want to self-disclose their gender identity and either abandon their application or experience frustration/confusion while completing it.
- **Usability Risks** (can people figure out how to use it):
  - There is a risk that the incorrect gender identity may be selected.
- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data):
   - None
  
- **Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact):
  - Increase in application submissions.
  - Increase in gender identity information available


### Solution Summary
- In-scope:
     - A single question added to the 10-10EZ form that will allow a Veteran to select their gender identity.
- Out of scope:
     - Any clean-up / changes to the existing form.
