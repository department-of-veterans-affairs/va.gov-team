# 06/22/23 Martinsburg 10-10EZR/Registration Only conversation with frontline staff

## Registration-only related questions
### Overall process
  - Describe your "registration" process.
    - They do this, but it gets complicated. Veterans aren't 100 percent sure which one to do. Very few of registration-only vs. enrollment.
    - Military transfers are the main ones that registers. Explain it as access to healthcare but not enrollment.
  - Process for registration then enrollment?
    - They have to fill out the EZ again to enroll.
  - Do most Veterans know what their priority group is/understand?
    - We let them know their group when they enroll. They also get booklets with information. They do know offhand. They know immediately when they fill out the information.
### Registration meaning/awareness
- What does "Registration" mean to you when signing up Veterans for health care benefits?
    - Mental health services come up here. MST services. Not a lot of Veterans know this unless they talk to staff. Sometimes humanitarian services come up.
Refers to ineligible people receiving care through the ER. Humanitarian care only ER (that they know of).
### Eligibility / guiding Veteran
  - How do you provide guidance to Veterans when they are not sure if they should register or enroll?
  - What other questions you ask to steer toward registration?
      - None that they can think of? Most of them want to enroll.
  - What benefit is there of register vs. enrollment?
    - They can be clinically seen, like with MST (?). We do get Veterans interested in nursing home facilities, which is covered through registration. MTF referrals come from Veterans who are about to transition out. Will have future discharge date, and patient advocate will often let them know when they need to get out of registration.
    - Folks see registration at top: Veterans will sometimes check register box. But want to enroll. Creates confusion. Had one the other day. Veterans sometimes want to set up a team and not know this, and need to go to enrollment.
### Perfect state
  - What’s one thing you’d change in the overall registration/application process if you had a magic wand?
    - EZR: Add to provide financial information. It depends how often this comes up.
    - Form left blank around expenses with one Veteran. Was in pension threshold. Could have been a wrong group.
  - When a Veteran fills out financial information, are they automatically referenced with IRS data?
    - Don't know. It seems random who gets audited.
    - Veterans will give us financial information we put them in a place. Then they get rejected by MVR. Sometimes, takes a month, sometimes can be automatic.

## EZR-related questions
### Typical process
  - Most Veterans are not aware they need to update their information regularly. They do it for travel benefits or their copay exemption.
- What type of information do Veterans consider most important to update and why?
  - Copay/financial information
- What are some major pain points for Veterans and staff as they go through the process?
  - Income can change and go up. They receive bills for copays, and they come in to update it and will see if they have to pay it or not. It's a big requirement for travel pay.
- Use cases for filling out EZR:
  - When Veterans calls to update dependent only, is there a script that points the Veterans elsewhere?. 
  - Update only one portion of the EZR, like dependents: Hasn't really happened a lot.
- Processes
  - Flags: Staff receives trigger notifications to ask Veterans. Do Veterans receive certain notifications to update their information? (Insurance/ financial disclosure)
Veterans receive letter to update their means test.
  - Been longer than 2011, would have to keep getting travel pay. Also, PG4 status is important to update.
- Flags: When staff receive the tiggers, do they do anything beyond the typical flow such as phone call? How do the Veterans know to update? What happens after the Veterans update? Is there a phone call/email/letters?
  - Letters are sent out. Know of no other letters, besides for copay bills.
  - Will receive information on what's required, copay and means test required. Also, HEC sends out information as well. This is by mail.
- If the Veterans only want to update one section (Address), how do the staff proceed?
  - Walk-ins happen, and address updates happen on the spot.
- What happens when the Veterans submit an incomplete EZR?
  - Maybe once or twice for insurance information. Most of the team, they submit the whole form. Financial information is transferred to HEC for updates. PG 3,4 will need to update if they fall into certain threshold to receive travel benefits.
### Updates/frequency
- Are there certain demographic/ Priority Groups that update their information more than others?
  - Travel benefits update a lot. Any PG above 2 will update more. They let them know that if income changes, could be put into verified status. PGs can change when income changes.
- What methods or channels do veterans prefer for updating their information?
  - Lots of walk-ins and phone calls. Refer to main headquarters. Wait times can be tough and long. Will be upset if they want to update means. WIll offer to mail.
- Perfect state?
  - Online will be helpful to some Veterans. Will eliminate call wait times. Would help Veterans without transportation.

## Synthesis
- Confusion over registration option:
  - Veterans are sometimes confused over having both the option to register and enroll on the form. They're not 100% sure which to choose.
  - Staff know when to register or not. Walk-ins can receive guidance on this, but mail-ins do not.
- Financial information is pain point
  - Veterans may provide inaccurate information and receive a priority status they don't actually qualify, they can be audited
  - Often, this becomes a problem when Veterans start to receive co-pay bills in the mail that they don't expect and don't believe they need to pay
  - Good rule of thumb: anyone above Priority Group 2 has to occasionally update their means test/financial info to keep exemption status
- Common EZR process
  - Big reason for filling out EZR is to get copay exemption or travel pay
  - Walk-ins, mail-ins, or updating over the phone (with HEC, VAMCs aren't allowed to take info over phone) are the methods
  - VAMC staff would prefer an option to fill EZR out online to help cut down on mail-ins and phone call wait times
- Reg only for humanitarian purposes or military transfer
  - Though registration only is a rarer occurence, it's still useful for things like humanitarian admittance to the ER or military transfers coming off active duty
- Priority groups
  - Veterans learn their priority group when enrolling and receive information about their benefits
