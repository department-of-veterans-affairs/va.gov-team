- Does the American Indian question appear on the 10-10EZ on-line application form as per design mock (after after the race, ethnicity, origin question)?
- Does clicking the drop-down button next to "What it means to be recognized..." display appropriate additional text?
- Do the "Yes" and "No" choices display correctly and allow for only one option to be selected? (Will this be a required field? If not, how does it work if you click “Yes” and then decide you don’t want to answer – does clicking outside the radio button remove selection?)
- Does an error message display if user selects "Continue" without choosing "Yes" or "No"?
- Does selecting the "Continue" button take user to next screen?
- Does the "Back" button take user back to previous screen?
- Can user opt to “Finish this application later” and see confirmation that the app was saved along with button to “Continue your application”
