### Va.gov dashboard eligibility display

**Tasks to do before design**

- Confirm what information we have and can relate re: people's statuses
  - Ask if there are pieces of information that we sometimes have, but not always.
  - Figure out if Gabe/Lihan should do this or if this should come from Josh Faulkner.

**Design to-dos**

- Based on content we have, design module.
  - While the module should be relatively consistent across different scenarios, there may be some slight variations based on each use case:
    - Enrolled (ideally telling them when, and at what VAMC)
    - Pending (ideally telling them when they applied, to which VAMC, about how long applications take, and info on how to follow up)
    - Not Enrolled (Information on when they applied, why they are ineligible, and what next steps they might take)
- Work with content team on copy.
