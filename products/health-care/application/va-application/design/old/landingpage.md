**If you served on active duty, and separated under conditions other than dishonorable, you may qualify for VA health care.**

The VA operates America’s largest integrated health care system, with over 700 sites of care. It is consistently ranked among the nation’s top health care providers. 

Health care at the VA includes preventive, primary, and specialty care; prescriptions; mental health care; home health care; geriatrics and extended care; medical equipment and prosthetics; and more. Most Veterans qualify for cost-free health care services, although some Veterans must pay modest copays for health care or prescriptions.
