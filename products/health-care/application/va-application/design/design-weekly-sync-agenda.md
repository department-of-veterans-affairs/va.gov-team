- Katelyn wants to ask HEC some Support Doc questions (HEC document review time).
- The team notes the confusion around the Gulf War question. A veteran mentioned there is a ‘second’ Gulf War (Iraq War) and the list of locations includes countries not from the 1990 Gulf War.
- Hieu informs Lois of the VES team’s idea around a Healthcare Hub.

## 2024-04-29
Attendees: Angela, Hieu, Katelyn, Jessica, Lois, Kristen, Mitch, and Matt K.

**Team Intro**
- Lois with USDS, integrated design team care, lots of design research for big companies.
- How Lois worked with other teams: Primary OCTO stakeholder for research and design, unblock VA barriers; consultant, and inform.
- Keep track of Apply team (Hub)
- Lois will join 30 minutes into the meeting

**Other Topic**
- VA Notify - integration to EZ/EZR is still in the discussion phase
- The team shows Lois the setup: Slack Channels, slack stand-up, EZ/CG and EZR roadmap, Mural, Github, Figma



## 2024-04-22
Attendees: Angela, Hieu, Katelyn, Jessica, Kristen, Alex (briefly), and Emily (briefly).

**OCTO**
- Lois Lewis will take over Kristen position as our main point-of-contact while Kristen takes additional OTCO responsibilities. 
- Lois will join us for UX Sync, the HEC calls, the PO sync.
- Emily wants to set up a demo for Lois.
- Kristen will post an intro and indicate which meeting Lois will join in.


**EZ TERA synthesis**
- All participants think that they’ve been exposed to toxic material but not sure what qualifies. 
  - Kristen notes that for the clinical reminder research (all the questions during a doctor visit), asbestos was brought up multiple times.
- Kristen advised putting more information within the “key finding” since that is how others would most likely be skimming information.
- ES cannot accept special characters in the text input but they’re aiming to roll that out during the summer 2024. Jessica to double check.
- Kristen noted there is already a Veteran outreach team, reaching out to veterans without healthcare and PACT-like, and wonders if there is a way to integrate this info with the larger effort.
- Kristen suggests talking to Danielle (Content) about VBA for overarching.
- Hieu notes that we can be more transparent in the TERA info: say info will help the VA denote potential, definition may expand in the future.
- Scrolling is a Form Library issue.
- Jessica notes that at least 2 participants had to Google to clarify their service location and period. Kristen recommends adding a bullet point to the finding. 
- Jessica/Kristen noted the slide deck used for the stakeholder is the same one with OCTO findings with certain slides turned off. Kristen recommends breaking the presentation into two parts and presenting with pictures.


## 2024-04-15
Attendees: Angela, Hieu, Katelyn, Jessica, & Kristen.

**EZR V2**
- Hieu presents the confirmation flow with the complexity breakdown

**EZR TERA Launch Recap**
- The team approaches the release with a content and code freeze implementation. It went okay as there was one launch blocker.
- Content misalignment with incremental layout, static page is owed by Content but requires Developers to set up/edit the widget.

**Registration**
- Talked about HEC meeting on 4/10/24 where the MVP user flows Mural and rough mocks were shown
- Received decision about priority of contacting for registrtion mvp: 1. call, 2. download/mail, 3. facility
- Have contacts for data gathering
- Will schedule internal meeting to go over next steps or review in Sprint Planning

**CG Updates**
- Next up priority to focus on (they are minor design and content updates needed)
- Needs to be live by June


**Looking Ahead**
- Kristen and Patrick are in dialogue for upcoming items such as documentation attachment, HEC Aduit, and Registration-only next steps, and Event Bus integration. 
- Jessica mentioned smart branching logic exploration per feedback from toxic exposure usability sessions




## 2024-04-08

Attendees: Angela, Hieu, Jessica, & Kristen.


- Went over high level take-aways from the toxic exposure research sessions last week - Veterans expressing wanting smart logic in the form flow. An example being, if a Veteran enters their DOB and military service dates, the tera questions they are seen should be relevant to them like skipping questions about Vietnam or Agent Orange if they did not serve in that time
- 
- Hieu went over the choose your own adventure flow and talking through the options and engineering chats around that so far. Part of this includes updates to using the multiple responses/card pattern. Kristen mentioned a confirmation flow could have the same Veteran experience impact with less engineering lift, to consider that route.

- Registration.... talked over the MVP Option 1 flow and the outstanding HEC questions that we want to talk through on Wednesday. Mostly around the data we want to get before and after this goes live to track the data for the service-connected 10-40% use case. Kristen mentioned that the Option B prototype testing (aka the digital solution for registration) is probably a lower priority of other items.

- EZ/CG priorities - know the CG updates is next up as we wrap up the EZ toxic exposure research. After that with the registration mvp, Kristen will initiate convos on the UX priorities with the other initiatives coming up


## 2024-04-01
Attendees: Angela, Hieu, Katelyn, Jessica, & Kristen.

**REGISTRATION:**
- Jessica presents the MVP options.
- Kristen suggests going with Option A (PDF) and seeing if Option B (Short Form, Registration VES status) is even worth it. 
- Angela suggested the possibility of calling in since it would be easier and faster for the Veterans. Kristen noted that we would have to touch base with HEC since it would be staff-impacted.
- Angela wants to clarify rolling the PDF before the Enrollment System is ready. Kristen confirms. 
- Decision: going with Option A, implementing ASAP but need to check with HEC first (need some wireframe). We’ll need to investigate Option B

**EZR V2**
- Hieu presents the two strongest possible Confirmation and CYOA options.
- Kristen asked if both flows could work in conjunction. Hieu notes that the CYOA does not add additional value since the Veteran still has to go back and review other sections so technically the Confirmation is a stronger choice.
- Kristen recommends looking into the UK.gov Task to further develop the CYOA flow.
- Katelyn wonders if there is a variation for CYOA Option A - Question, where there is a checkmark selection. This would be looking into a future where the Veteran does not have to review all sections/information.


## 2024-03-18
Attendees: Angela, Katelyn, Jessica, & Kristen.

**REGISTRATION:**
- Chatted about registration next steps
- Such a massive problem that it can be intimidating when diving into workflows
- The balancing act of wire framing out an ideal long-term state vs what could be realistic for MVP
- Kristen - think about one use case - if we can help that experience and learn from it start from there

**TERA RESEARCH (EZ end March/early April)**
- Goal 1 is what Kristen was looking for
- Think about recruit / methodologies - mentioned recent VBA observational study where maybe diverging from the traditional recruit method with Perigean might be worth looking into.
- Angela and Jessica to meet and go over methodologies and recruitment
- Will have Kristen review Research Plan and Convo Guide once ready to submit for approval
- Will do a kickoff call with Perigean

**ROADMAPS**
- Kristen to reach out to Alex about including iterations, improvements, research findings and working that into the roadmap plan

**DOCUMENT UPLOADING**
- Update is that EZR will not be “announced” until uploading documents feature added
- UX questioning the need - balancing the business side purpose with the Veterans’ experience and mental model



## 2024-03-11
Attendees: Angela, Hieu, Jessica, & Kristen.

- TERA Mural Board, consider splitting the exposure based on region.
- Jessica has started the mural board for TERA questions
- Registration-Only User Journey Mural
  - Reg vs Enrollment is still an issue
  - Kristen: consider new patients vs existing patients (only registered at certain sites, this would be extending to new locations) on the map
  - We’re the lead in understanding lead benefits, other teams are “after registration” such as the appointment section
  - How much info should show up on MHV landing page vs the Profile.
  - Ranking of the biggest impact of which concept (we only went on the biggest Reg Only reason).
  - Kristen wants to see an MVP proposal, ideal if it can incorporate multiple reasons. 


## 2024-03-04
Attendees: Angela, Hieu, Jessica, & Katelyn.

- Registration-Only workshop session (Angela): 
  - Workshop #3 went well with Samantha and Roosevelt (RJ) giving extensive answers. We did not get one question answered but there is a bi-weekly check-in we can use to ask.
  - The team talked about the unknown timeframe of the wireframe and the journey mapping. We will try to get feedback from the VES team, showing in-progress items.
- Confirmation Flow Design (Hieu)
  - A few things to consider: 
    - The primary focus of the EZR is to update the household financial information. 
    - The multiple response component we utilized in the EZR MVP is a major factor in keeping the flow as soon as possible. 
  - Comparison between the EZR  v2 and Confirmation flow screen count is not much different (24 vs 21 screens) when including Military Info, TERA, and EC/NOK. 
  - Angela notes that the multiple component is better because the Veteran can edit certain information when there are multiple cards.
  - Design consideration:
    - The information we surface needs to be a balance between recognized vs recalled. (example: show the Veteran street but not city, state and zip. We would need research to confirm our hypothesis.
    - Check-in with the Forms team on the Multiple Response component (Matt Dingy, Jeana Clark. The Claim Team may have similar components)
- Upcoming Research (Jessica):
  - We should group the TERA research with some outlier, secondary research questions. Things to consider: research on the TERA on EZ vs EZR. 
- Hint Text (Katelyn)
  - Katelyn notes multiple redundancy in the content/text (Work vs Job). 
  - Team talked through multiple possible arrangements, with an option to have only 1 additional information to keep the content to a minimum. 
  - Team wants to be more proactive with refining and updating the forms. 
- Ideal state - Explore the ideal state of healthcare enrollment, 
  - Consider in-person research (all UXers are relatively close to VA facilities).
  - Consider beyond the scope of form/application (holistic health care journey). 



## 2024-02-26
Attendees: Angela, Hieu, & Katelyn.

- Team discuss EZR v2 using mural - Top priority includes Confirmation Flow, Notification, Save-in-progress, Household Income reference, NOK/EC.
- Team discuss Content Component in Figma - consider creating a variable for the Desktop vs. mobile. 
- Hint Text - not discussed
- Team consider doing another sync midweek.

## 2024-02-20
Attendees: Angela, Hieu, Jessica, Katelyn, & Kristen.

- Hieu updated the EZR Audit works, need to reach UXers to test certain pages.
- Jessica notes the EZ/EZR FormContent, naming convention standards. We’ll have a main base for the content
- UX Ticket grooming session

## 2024-02-12
Attendees: Angela, Hieu, Jessica, Katelyn, Kristen, and Alex.

- TERA: The team wants HEC to confirm that TERA information may be passed along to their EHR Records (Clinical Records in VISTA).
  - Kristen notes that from the MSA side, there are so many 'flags' on the record.
- Hieu presents graphic screens and page counters for Military Info and TERA on EZR.
- Registration Only workshop: The team discusses the possible use of chat and calling on people to make the session more interactive.

## 2024-02-05
Attendees: TBD

- Update on our proposed approach for SiP sections on EZ and EZR:
    - Component we plan to use is on the [design system site](https://design.va.gov/components/card#claims-status) and is live to 100% of users in the claims status tool
    - Auth Exp is also looking to implement this component for their Claims and Appeals section
    - Do we want to consider implementing this solution without formal usability testing? We could still plan to get feedback on it when we do testing
    - The only caveat is that we'd be using it a little differently than it's used for claims since we're alerting the user to unfinished form content

## 2024-01-29
Attendees: TBD

- UX Grooming: can we review the UX work spreadsheet and clean it up? It's a bit messy with some icebox work, completed work, etc.

## 2024-01-22
Attendees: Angela, Hieu, Jessica, Katelyn, (Heather and Kristen for second half)

- Mini UX Refinement Session
- Opened UX Work Spreadsheet and reviewed items
- Also reviewed Figma spreadsheet with assignments by page

- When Kristen joined - pivoted to talking about Toxic Exposure questions
- She will be helping to connect our team with the 526 team
- Reviewed current status of the draft and flow of questions
- Outstanding SME questions, esp around short form
- Wondering how/when to end question flow - if answer yes to one, skip the remaining. Depends on how ES is going to be built, a yes/no boolean value or the details of each individual question?


## 2024-01-16
Attendees: Angela, Hieu, Jessica, Katelyn, Heather, and Kristen.

- Toxic Exposure
    - We already have the Mural and a PACT Act wizard (check eligible then apply for 10-10).
    - Kristen mentioned that the OCTO team had some recent related research with Nina synthesizing this week and Kristen will do a first path.
    - Step 1 is to gather all the information.
    - There are talks of adding this information to the 526. If that is the case, how can that information be captured so the Veteran does not have to fill out the same information in the 10-10. Is there another backend system that connects this information? Is the Enrollment System ready for this information?
    - "If the answer is YES for X, does it mean they don't have to answer the following question?" Map the workflow after the initial discovery step.
    - The veteran wants to be asked the questions again when the definition of Toxic exposure changes.
- OCTO Presentation
    - Print PDF to Kristen.
    - Re-word the text for HEC focused on wanting to stay true to the paperform.
    - Note that it is a new FORM, step 1 is MVP, with the following steps including Notification workflow.
- Registration-only Update
    - Jessica started a rough script, Angela will read it.


## 2024-01-08
Attendees: Angela, Hieu, Jessica, Katelyn, And Heather

- Error Matrix - The team decide that Github would only hold the link while the Mural would have the Source of Truth.

- Team discussed the use of the UX ticket spreadsheet has a place to organize and plan the tickets.

- EZR MVP UAT presentation for HEC
    - Angela presented the current slide deck.
    - Team discuss the possible Next Steps to present: EZR V2 including short-form (Recommendation 1), the Review/Sub-task flow (Recommendation 3), and the Post-MVP usability research (recommendation 2). Angela will talk to Alex in regards to the overall priorities, including NoK/EC. And we should include that all of these features will be incrementally released. 

- Team discuss the possibility of presenting the Registration Only work to the OCTO. There were two schools of thought; present sooner to show the struggle with a reluctant stakeholder or present later in hopes of capturing some progress through workshops. 

## 2023-12-18
Attendees: Angela, Hieu, Jessica, Katelyn, And Kristen

- Figma: The team notes that Multiple Component Card is not yet a Figma Component

- EZR MVP Veteran Testing: Heather is looking for Veterans to test the end-to-end form. We would be looking for lower Priority Group (Veterans that would be required to provide financial information).

- Registration: 
  - Team discussion potential next steps as we like the hub approach the VES team represented, it aligns with the Veterans’ mental model. 
  - The difficult part is how to tell that story to the HEC stakeholders. 
  - Katelyn notes the HEC likes to have visuals to share, perhaps we can create a Journey Map in PDF for them.
  - Jessica notes the importance of including the HEC folks in some of the process (Veteran’s journey map, study quotes).

- Updated Dependent Flow
  - Only updating copy in at the Education Expense if the user adds more than a zero in gross annual income.
  - Flow has to be simplified, no longer a technical burden.

- After the EZR MVP launch
  - Kristen brought up Facilities API. The drop-down is dated and does not connect with current data. Jessica notes that CareGiver’s facility has similar functionality we can utilize.


## 2023-12-11
Attendees: Angela, Hieu, Jessica, Katelyn, Kristen, and Alex

- EZR research - Katelyn to reach out to design Platform peeps to get the team on the schedule for end of January to present at the Monday VA design/research/content sync, Hieu to start work on a combo presentation deck (will need to open a ticket for this)
  
- EZR research - Alex, we want to present to HEC at some point in January too; future parking lot planning item to chat more

- Dependents verbiage/flow - the flow updates we are in agreement; will work with Aliyah this week to get the reported income content draft created. Noting here to tackle later - in the future see if the income questions on the form can be simplified down to what really impacts health care benefits.

- SIP - more looking into the other teams and what version they have; working on getting CodePen templates setup for testing

- Registration - Need to schedule a research readout for this week first, then a workshop session either next week or after the new year/Holidays. Workshop session  registration next steps and mapping.

- Kristen's comment:
    - Recommendation: does not have to be limited to the product/team, think of it as a holistic service.
    - For Registration, what would be the ideal workflow for the Veterans?

## 2023-12-04
Attendees: Angela, Hieu, Jessica, Katelyn, Kristen, and Alex

EZ/R issues discussed
- Research Synthesis
    - Findings were not launch blocking
    - Every participant had minor hiccups and things they would like to clarify but it is not consistent location where that occurs. 
- Status, PendingMT is Post MVP
    - Content has looked at the info.
    - For MVP, we will skip the financial information if they already done the Means Test.
- Education Expenses question verbiage
    - Team found that education expense verbiage is awkward.
    - Jessica notes that it is more about dependent age vs dependent income. Currently, the conditional is based on the depedent's age when it should be around the dependent's income.
    - The main question: how is this information impacting the veteran health care?
- EC/NOK
    - There is a max/min number of EC and NoK within the Enrollment System?
    - Alex notes that we're should start with only one EC/NoK
    - Question for dev: does it wipe the data of the previous one when you ending a new one?
- Save-in-progress
    - Update for Kristen; the team wants to appoarch this problem and solve it correctly the first time.
    - Note for Frontend stating that feature flag does not work here since the team does not have access to the the form data functions. We should consider CodePin.
    - Angela to clarify the feature flag with Matt Long.
    - Kristen ask if this can be tested with other feature of the EZR? The team notes that is the intention.
- EZ Intro Page
    - Flagged by platform because it has subway stepping component. There is a recommendation to go towards the current, shorter introduction page standard.
    - Current Alert is flagged because it is not in current form library. But this alert pushes the user to sign in to get current status.
    - Kristen: Did the 526 dropped the Alert from the top? Conceptually, the layout is the same the 10-10 team. Jessica will look into that.

Registration issues discussed
- Registration Tree Test
    - 35 test completed
    - Team starting to synthesis the study.
    - Not much succecss with where we hypothesize.
    - The testers wants an apointment schedule as part of the process.
    - VS is excited with the disability section.


## 2023-11-27
Attendees: Angela, Jessica, Hieu, Katelyn, Kristen, and Alex

EZR issues discussed
- Save-in-Progress
    - The main consideration is a visual alert, similar experimental design of the Platform System team.
    - Option 1: alert message within the multiple-response component card.
    - Option 2: alert above the card, with the name listed.
    - Kristen inquired if the component had been tested with the alert. Angela later confirmed that it had not been tested.
    - Team needs to discuss with Dev if it is possible to bring the user to the incompleted page.
    - The team has not discussed or mocked what this would look like on the Review Page.
- Mean Test Status, Alert (Pending vs Enrolled)
    - For the MVP, the team is thinking of several slim alerts. (Enrolled, Pending, and already filled out before the household financial section).
    - MVP consideration: Should we consider blocking access to EZR if they already have a Mean Test for the current year? Kristen notes that the main reason for EZR is to capture the Mean Test and we currently have Enrolled terminality, this will require a Content update.
    - Discuss if the "mean test" is something the Veteran would understand. Kristen notes that the VA is looking to deprecate that term.
    - Questions the team needs answering: what is the number of Veterans on the Pending List? Does enrollment change from Enrolled to Pending on Jan 1st?
- The team notes that the MVP bugs are on the Dev's hand
- Research Synthesis can be discussed on Tuesday since SIP and Mean Test alert is a priority.


## 2023-11-20
Attendees: Angela, Jessica, Hieu, Katelyn, Kristen, Heather and Alex

EZR issues discussed
- A need for an alert on the EZR intro page when a Veteran has a status of PendingMT or Pending other, we talked about if this could be in phase 2 and MVP would only be for those who are already fully enrolled.
- Thought of after the call… should the pendingMT alert on the EZ include a link to the EZR once it goes live?
- Will work on a draft, but has other implications and talking about v2. We won’t be able to get early content review until next week. 

Hieu - UX issues found during Friday’s research UAT session
- Review page when you try and edit Medicare Part A yes/no question and click Update Page run into an error - ticket #70261
    - Kristen notes that it is a Form Library issue, Review Page is heavily controlled by them.
- Save in progress link button resets yes/no on the Mailing Address page - ticket #70258

Insurance page 
- Agreed with the arrangement of moving additional info component into main content as short term solution
- Discussed pattern implications of current and future state with use cases including when prefilled and if that information would still be valuable

EZ Intro page topics
- Reviewed drafts. 
- Follow up with forms / design system team on if the heading “What to know… “ is locked in or if we could adjust that.
- Changed numbered headlines from stepper into h2s utilizing the newer page template
- Also follow up to see if other teams have template or if there are/will be form templates for intro pages when an authenticated user has interacted with a form previously and/or was approved/denied

Design will schedule a follow up meeting tomorrow on the save in progress pattern issue

## 2023-11-13

Attendees: Angela, Jessica, Hieu, Katelyn

- Team discussed the minor changes in the conversation guide of the EZR MVP UAT: added instruction to sign in to a backup account, moved the "beta version" blurb closer to the scenario, and added a blurb at the Review section.
- Coordination with Sara Sterkenburg on MHV team to update the link on the MHV Landing Page: we have looped her in a while back but will waiting for an exact launch date before pinging her team to the link.
- Jessica noted that most SHOULD feedback items on the STAGING REVIEW comment have been picked up or it is a Form's Library limitation/constraint.

## 2023-11-06

Attendees: Angela, Jessica, Hieu, Katelyn, Kristen, Alex, Heather, Emily

- Team discussed the submission dependent error (applies to all Mutilple Response components and how to approach it.
- Short-term approach for the Contradictory alerts and contents:
    - Staging is using the v1 Stepper Component that contains the “We’ll save your application on every change. Your application ID number is ####.” message.” This is part of the forms library, it cannot be changed.
    - The Sketch mockup uses v3, which does have the message. Once the form library is updated, dev can update the Stepper to v3.
    - The solution: remove the “Finish this application later” function for the Multiple Response section and add a warning stating they must complete the required field in this section.

- We discussed how discovery works needs to be done on the multiple components.
    - Why doesn’t pre-fill work on this component? 
    - If “query’ requires each page to have a unique URL, can we have multiple URLs? How does this work with multiple dependents? 
    - How are other teams approaching this? Tabs you can edit? Task-list, sub-task? 
- Can we incorporate a generative study? 
    - UAT, upcoming Nov 13-22: leave as is.
    - Usability Study in the middle of January: maybe
- We discuss how this work also revolves around EZR V2, Review & Confirm flow. And it would be good to jump-start it.

## 2023-10-30

Attendees: Jessica, Hieu, Katelyn, Kristen, Alex, Heather, Emily


- EZR MVP Research
    - Went over conversation guide:
    - How should the participant get to the static page? The team thinks it is a better scenario to have the Veteran update their Insurance.
    - UX should ask the developer for update, and staging links since we want to submit research ASAP.

- Midpoint Review
    - UX should have Assistive Tech user for Usability Research (in December)
    - A MUST-change (launch blocking) for the Review Page, wording on the Agreement. Team must confirm with HEC SME.
    - Design MUST: Reviewers wants the Additional Info to be shorter, more in line with the Guidelines. While lengthy, the content in the household is needed. The team feels the need to push back.

- Registration Tree-Test:
    - Waiting for HEC to respond.
    - Mural Presentation, we had (2) questions that needed answer.

- Team wants to hold Registration since EZR takes priority.


## 2023-10-23

Attendees: Jessica, Hieu, Kristen, Alex


- Went over registration presentation deck
- Talked about reframing the deck outline to be focused on the scenarios and remove the other slides
- Use examples and Sketch wireframes within the scenario examples instead of at the end of the presentation
- Talked about cohorts for registration tree test; focusing on most being unenrolled but a cohort or two of enrolled with disability ratings. 



## 2023-10-16

Attendees: Jessica, Katelyn, Hieu, Kristen


- Talked about EZ intro page for those who are already enrolled and the adjustments needed once the EZR goes live
  - Next steps: 
  - Consider changes to the content around updates to benefits, the two headline sections could be combined
  - Look at both primary and secondary action links in the design system
  - Consider the only call to action on the page to be the "update benefit" button.

- Talked about the Registration updates late last week and how to re-approach the problem
  - Next steps:
  - Working sessions for research questions and research goals
  - Once those are refined; begin thinking through research methods/logistics

## 2023-10-11

Attendees: Jessica, Katelyn, Hieu, Kristen


- Reviewed Registration Flow Exploration and Matrix comparrison work and discussed the pros/cons/differences between each of these
- Also talked about variations of the flows and what would make sense MVP term and ideal state, what mvp could build up/set the foundation for the ideal state
- Decided on a flow variation where on the intro page there is a Veteran and non-Veteran split/ action links, followed by a prioritization wizard.
  - Followed by a prioritization wizard
  - Consider the short-form as part of the MVP
- The business logic (unauthenticated) flow is the backup.
- Next steps to create wireflow of mvp direction and share back with team


## 2023-10-02

Attendees: DK, Katelyn, Jessica, Kristen

- EZR - insurance section to match ez regarding headlines (h3-ish). We won't introduce new field set legends for mvp.
- EZR Research Planning - started talking about research goals and who to recruit. Looking towards 2 cohorts with different disability ratings, those over 50% and those under 10%. Talked about starting the convo guide at VA.gov and not on the form intro page so we can learn more about the wayfinding side of it and if there is confusion between the static and intro pages
- Registration Research Synthesis - went over Mural board and first draft of key findings; going to add in more details and examples around some of the findings like the learning curve, burden of proof and the benefits overlap from the Veteran's perspective. More chats to come on recommendations and next steps

A few quick notes from the session, which was mostly about the EZR work:

- Decision: Show statuses on first page and every section.
- Need to check with engineers about save data to PDF form.
- In aggreenent to ditch the stepper if possible.
- [Post MVP Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1693945362104/f2d83704cf9de28206d5cb28e1b188a3f87b96e9?sender=ubf5503bf47b6eb1e92730053) to track future enhancements.

## 2023-08-21

Attendees: DK, Katelyn, Hieu, Kristen, Alex

A few quick notes from the session, which was mostly about the EZR work:

- We probably don't need the stepper on the form intro page. Check with Matt L. on nixing it.
- Work on next appointment language could be helpful. Check with that team.
- Check on application vs. form language with content.
- What happens when people with account go into form, but aren't enrolled and can't apply? We need an alert for this.
- Need a ticket for error messages. Look at the EZ for inspiration here.

## 2023-08-14

Attendees: DK, Katelyn, Hieu, Kristen, Emily, Alex

**EZR form wireframe**: Hieu

- Jessica's feedback in Sketch all straight forward and had no main questions or challenges.
- DK's feedback around one thing per page: Can we still combine fields that can't be changed? DK: Yes, it was a concern and possible feedback that Collab Cycle folks might have. But it can still be explored.
- Kristen to review the wireframes this week.

**Research synthesis**: Katelyn

- Katelyn to carve out slides/sections she wants to work on in HEC deck and Mural.
- Katelyn to make a working session for today to team can collaborate on synthesis more.

## 2023-08-07

Attendees:

**Research sync on current research + synthesis**: All

- Research is showing Profile would be the best location for EZR info. We'll need to have the conversation with PRA folks. Alex to set up a meeting with them, Kristen and Patrick when Patrick is back from vacation.
- One middle ground might be to link to a separate EZR form from the Profile, if we have to walk in both worlds of a separate form and putting it in a location where Veterans want it. Still working both angles: Profile and separate form flow.
- Designers will meet to walk through submitting for Household study.

**EZR wireframe**: Hieu

- Showed spreadsheet with field comparison. Will work on wireframe of separate form flow next.
- Look at Pre-checkin for confirm flow.
- Could be a technical limitation because of Check-in confirm flow not being in forms library. Chat with engineers about the possibilities there.

## 2023-08-01

Attendees:  DK, Jessica, Katelyn, Hieu, Kristen, Heather, Alex, Fletcher

**Research organization and planning**

Prototype study: Could tackle the PRA stuff if it's strongly Profile direction. If not, back to the drawing board.
Mobile app is looking into Priority Groups. Touch base with them on research.

- Add in video check at end.
- Priority Group: Didn't know. Could we relate to disbility rating.
- Disability rating and financial ratings: How to this interplay? How is it used by other benefits? Maybe check out financial hardship form.
- Deadline remains the same for EZR whether it's a form or in Profile.

**Registration only study feedback** 

- Leave the priority group questions in this research.
- Good idea to show print version of the current state form.
- Ask about changes to ideal state after seeing the print form or an example.
- Cohort 1: Does warmup question make sense for folks who didn't enroll? Maybe it's around care? Delete for question, but keep second one.
- Third topic, first question: Break this question up some.
- Cohort 2: Warmup, maybe follow up on what kind of activities they do.
- First topic: Maybe too many questions for 10 minutes?

**Household study**

- Overlap. Will we need to get the prototype ready?
- Go lighter on Household section.
- Focus on one thing vs. all three studies.

## 2023-07-24

Attendees:  DK, Jessica, Katelyn, Kristen, Heather

**Research organization and planning**

We talked through logistics for our upcoming studies. The goal is to have a primary lead for each research activity and a backup. Two people would take each study.

- Katelyn to lead synthesis on FD
- Hieu to lead prototype next steps
- Hieu/DK to take planning on prototype research
- Jessica/DK on Household study
- Registration-only: Jessica/Katelyn to take lead
- Katelyn in Hawaii for Labor Day
- Sign up for mod. sessions.

[Full planning available in the research planning Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1686254946051/07405f6e988a0541dc0983cc5e286ba6fe612cf8?wid=189-1652380184686).



**Registration-only stuff**

- Same disclosure depending on registration-only flow? Not different for paper form. Still have to agree.
- Still some questions around the priority of the flows.
- Kristen/Patrick: Where should it be in the C&P process?
- This is early work so more coming.

**Memorable date component**

- Version 3 has month picker by name vs. date number. Maybe easier cognitively. Hasn't been tested by Veterans.
- How many date fields on EZ? Three/four or more. CG is a better testing ground.
- Maybe tradeoffs for each one would be better to see it all.
- Katelyn to make a list of tradeoffs for each path and share.

## 2023-07-17

Attendees:  DK, Jessica, Hieu, Katelyn, Kristen

- Send note to Robyn for research heads up. Waiting for AE feedback.

**HEC presentation for EZR work**

- DK to run through rough slides/presentation.

Action items:

- Add questions to slide deck.
- Ask about process in design

## 2023-07-10

Attendees: DK, Jessica, Hieu, Alex

**EZR related wireframes and meeting prep (Hieu)**

- We mostly talked through a strategy of how to pitch the EZR-related work in the Profile area of VA.gov.

**EZR related research (Jessica)**

- This mostly feels like it's in good shape after Jessica talked through it. No major feedback or changes.

## 2023-06-26

Attendees: DK, Jessica, Hieu, Katelyn, Kristen

**EZR discovery ticket (Hieu)**

- [Discovery for Veteran Information Editing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/58542): This ticket feels too big since scope changed. Let's take that back to Heather and Alex and see what we can do with it.
- We still need to do some sythesis on the Pittsburgh and Martinsburg research calls.

**Priority Group/Financial Info research (Jessica)**

Some big takeaways from this discussion:

- Let's do some more desk research to see what other teams have insight that can help with our current research efforts. Jessica has [notes in her Mural board](https://app.mural.co/invitation/mural/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1687381992402?sender=u773b824999f25f58b8e77486&key=2694912f-19c7-4254-8e86-ce74e6a4bdf0).

- Things to consider for Priority Group: unclear on what type of information can be shared with the Veterans. What is the tradeoff to showing that information? Should we be showing the overview definitions or the individualized PG?

## 2023-06-19

Attendees: DK, Jessica, Hieu, Katelyn, Kristen

**Progress bar/stepper (Hieu)**

Questions:

- What does our research say about the bar/stepper? Is it needed?
- Does this component still solve a problem Veteran has?
- What's the opportunity to interact with it? Maybe it becomes navigation in the future?

**CG business feedback (Katelyn)**

- Talked through a few potential copy changes. Katelyn to share those with content folks ahead of time off.

**Pittsburgh research call review (all)**

- Follow up on benefits packet to see the content.
- Cover roles in future call. Follow up on past call.
- Watch magic wand scenios for thoughts on tension between HEC center and employees at centers.

**Action items**

- Hieu to connect with forms design team and explore different options.

**VA 1010EZ Staff Research Questions**

We brainstormed questions for interviewing staff, done in these two Mural boards:

- [EZR discovery](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1684943221068/4b11f2d1902d05f12f53468263a561c2d5a460a9?wid=0-1684949791097)
- [EZ Registration-only path discovery](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1684348883203/49fc4ff1bf31f3cabe200663708c1002645b447f?wid=0-1686000958778)

**Registration-only (Jessica)**

- Jessica has a board with questions to answer via research.
- We talked through early reseach questions and what we're still missing as far as questions.

**EZR (Hieu)**

- Hieu walked us through the EZR Mural board and process flows he's created.
- We decided he's in a good place until we dig up more information through the scheduled meetings Alex is working on.

## 2023-05-29

## 2023-05-22

Attendees: DK, Jessica, Hieu, Katelyn, Kristen

**Introduction**

Kristen McConnell introduced herself as part of OCTO, works with Patrick Bateman, and will be in all of the syncs. She is part of the health team, the design and research lead, and the appointment lead. She wants to encourage the team to think very broadly, beyond the scope of one project.

**Registration only path**
- Jessica showed off her early discovery efforts on the registration only path. It's early still and there are a lot of unanswered questions.
- Kristen: Think broadly with this research. Maybe onsite research? What setups in E&E offices would you need? We can provide a list of requirements for the sites.
- Kristen: Do we need triggers on other pages? What are the access points and should they be more strategic?


**Designer skills**

We came up with this rough list during the meeting:

Visual design
Interaction design
Discovery work
Research
  - Planning
  - Analyzing
  - Running it
Content
  - Plain language
  - Microcopy
  - UX writing

Systems-level thinking
Journey mapping/Flows/Service design
Accessibility
  - Design reviews
  - Audits

Attendees: DK, Jessica, Hieu


**Headline and Radio label design discovery**
- Hieu walked through two examples for both radio buttons and h3s on the 1010EZ.
- Broadly, the group felt like the explorations would improve things for Veterans, but only incrementally. It avoids the real challenge, making the questions h1 elements and deemphasizing the progress bar.


**Misc Item (Tabled items; if time chat about next meeting)**
- Any onboarding related questions?
- Designer interests and experiences list
- Content process ideas
- Source of truth - what lives where - Sketch, Mural, Github

### Action items

- Hieu to update ticket and recommend we work on the bigger problem instead: h1 and progress bar.
- The team should think through how it can contribute to that work broadly.

## 2023-05-08

Attendees: DK, Jessica, Katelyn, Hieu, Matt K.

**Katelyn showing designs for an improved primary/secondary caregiver clarification experience.**

- Experimented with different versions of a table, featuring primary/secondary caregiver differences. Great for scanning. Could be a challenge on mobile. Check color contrast and design system contraints/experiemental patterns for table visual treatments. 
- Started with DK's copy, and it feels like a lot of copy no matter how you arrange it or what components you use.
- Introduction page updates so it uses design system intro patter/progress component
- Additional info component feels like a crutch here. Also, modals won't work well either. Maybe this is a good reason to explore altering the flow?

### Action items

- Katelyn to do some work on a next round of designs and bring it to our next meeting.
