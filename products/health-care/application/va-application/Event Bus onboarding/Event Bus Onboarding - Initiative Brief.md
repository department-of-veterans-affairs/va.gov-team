# Event Bus Onboarding - Initiative Brief

## Outcome Summary
- **MVP**: Begin to send 10-10EZ submission events to the Event Bus, so that the submission status can be shared with other consumers who would benefit from this event.
- **Future**: Support Enrollment System onboarding to Event Bus to send application statuses, so that the VA.gov 10-10EZ can expose really meaningful 10-10EZ status information to Veterans (whether on screen, via a notification, both, or other).

## Problem
* Veterans do not currently have a way to see the status of their health care application as it goes through the processing steps within VA
* 10-10EZ does not have a way to display the various statuses of an application on VA.gov without directly connecting and interpreting the statuses from the source system
* 10-10EZ does not have a way to transmit/communicate the submission status of the application from VA.gov to any other systems or applications without direct connections/integrations

## Desired User Outcomes
- Veterans will be able to see the status of their application on VA.gov as it moves through the processing steps in the Enrollment system

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Veterans will continue to receive and/or view minimal statuses of their application on VA.gov
- Veterans will continue to be unaware of what step in the process their application is and whether there have been any decisions made or further information needed.

## Desired Business Outcomes
- 10-10EZ will be able to consume application processing events from Enrollment system and display the meaningful statuses of Veterans' applications on VA.gov
- 10-10EZ will be able to produce the application submission status for other applications and/or systems to consume easily without direct connections or integrations

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- Enrollment system cannot onboard to Event Bus in a meaningful manner to share status events
- 10-10EZ is not able to consume Enrollment system events in a meaningful manner

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
> ðŸ’¡ *VA.gov products measure success against Ease of use, Service Completion, Trust/Satisfaction, Health.*<sup>1</sup>\
> ðŸ’¡ *Identify balancing metrics to ensure you're not bringing about undesired outcomes.*

- Product KPI | Baseline | Target | Link to data source (e.g. GA, Domo)

## Discovery
### Assumptions/Risks
> *Identify risks related to usability, value to users, feasibility/implementation, and viability given organizational constraints<sup>2</sup>. 
> Indicate how you'll validate/test against these risks. Inspired by [SVPG's Four Big Risks](https://www.svpg.com/four-big-risks/).*

- **Value Risks** (will people use it): 
  - Veterans will not understand the application status being displayed
  
- **Usability Risks** (can people figure out how to use it):
  - Veterans will not know or understand if any actions are required of them to keep the application moving through the process
  
- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data):
    - Upstream/Downstream API/Data availability and reliability
    - Site performance impacts (see [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse), [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/), #-daily-lighthouse-scan)
  
- **Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact):
     - VA stakeholder testing, marketing, compliance requirements 

### What're you building
- **MVP - In scope**
     - 10-10EZ onboard to Event Bus to produce the application submission event

- **MVP - Out of scope**
     - Enrollment system onboard to Event Bus
     - 10-10EZ to consume events from Event Bus
