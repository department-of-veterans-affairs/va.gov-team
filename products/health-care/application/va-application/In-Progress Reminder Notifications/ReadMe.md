## Problem
Veterans are not able to complete applications, and may be forgetting that they have an application in progress.  They may also not know how to return to it.
The reminders will encourage the Veteran to submit the application in order to receive benefits sooner. The link in the reminder email will take them back to the in progress application.


## Desired User Outcomes
- Shorten the time the application remains "in progress"
- Fewer expired applications
- More returns and submissions of saved applications

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Frustration in receiving email notifications they did not want

## Desired Business Outcomes
- Veterans are reminded of in progress applications and return to complete them

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- Confusion on submission status that leads to more expired applications
- Emails being ignored or sent to Spam/Junk folders without being read

## Discovery
### Assumptions/Risks

- **Value Risks** (will people use it): 
  - The value risk is that applicants will ignore the reminders. They could also route these emails to their spam/junk folder without realizing what it is for.  
  - There is also a risk that an email cannot be sent, if the Veteranâ€™s profile does not include an email address.
- **Usability Risks** (can people figure out how to use it):
  - There is a risk that, if the applicant is routed to My VA (via a link in the email when there is more than one in-progress application), they can be confused as to why they were not routed to the application itself.
- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data):
   - TBD
  
- **Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact):
  - Increase in applicant returns and submissions of in-progress applications


### Solution Summary
- In-scope:
     - Reminder Email to be sent through VA Notify template process for applications that are still in progress
     - Email will be sent using the profile ID of the logged in applicant
- Out of scope:
     - Confirmation emails
     - Any other email notifications
     - Using data within the application (such as the email address entered)
     - Applications started while unauthenticated, which would not be saved in progress
