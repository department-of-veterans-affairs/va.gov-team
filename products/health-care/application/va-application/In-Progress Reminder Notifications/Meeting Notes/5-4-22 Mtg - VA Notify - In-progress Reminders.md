## 10-10 & VA Notify Strike team - 10-10EZ Application Reminder Notifications


#### Notes
- Cadence for in-progress applications
     - This cadence was chosen because it was the least complicated, least annoying to applicant
     - Could be revisited after more applications use this cadence
     - When applicant returns to application, cadence restarts
          - No activity at 7 days, an email is triggered with a link
          - Every 2 weeks after that
          - Forms expired at 60 days - Reminders stop
- Collab Cycle completed, and the feature launched last week!
     - Content approved & privacy is good
     - Can use that same template for 10-10ez
- When there is only one application in-progress
     - Email is sent with a direct link to the application
- When there is more than one application in-progress
     - One email is sent with all in-progress applications listed
     - There is a link to My VA page which shows all apps in progress
- Emails will only be sent to Authenticated applicants with email addresses in VA.gov profile
     - Email will not be sent to the email address entered in the Application (if different)
     - If there is no email address in profile, no email will be sent
- Is text available for in-progress?
     - Text is available, however there are more strict laws
     - Must have an Opt-In selection for Veterans (log-in preferences)
          - This is on Profile page (only some are available today)
- Push Notifications for Flagship Mobile app
     - Notify Veteran that they have a secure message

#### Process to submit for In-Progress reminder emails implementation
- 10-10 team to send approval for cadence and content to VA Notify team
- VA Notify team can take it from there!
     - Timeline: 1-2 sprints
     - Testing will need to be completed with both teams engagement, along with new use case of multiple apps in progress (since we would be the 2nd application to onboard to In-progress reminders)
- 10-10 team to provide Metrics - In-progress applications for the month of April to compare after implementation
     - Metrics are tracked in [Domo by VA Notify team](https://va-gov.domo.com/page/2040841289?userId=228456075)
     - Metrics looking good so far, click-thrus 32% for 686 form

#### Future endeavor
- Looking to moving the EZ confirmation email to VA Notify
- 10-10 team will need to see how that email is triggered today and the best way to move that to point to VA Notify (or other best solution)
