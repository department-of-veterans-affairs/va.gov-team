## 10-10 & VA Notify Strike team - 10-10EZ Application Reminder Notifications


#### Notes
Met with Megan Siddle & VA Notify Strike team on updated process for reminder emails - they will be sent after 7 days of inactivity only.  If Veteran accesses and triggers the Save In-progress, the 7-day clock resets.  
Per Megan, they saw the most engagement with the 7-day reminder, and a huge increase in conversion!  
>(The open rate was 71% is now 91%; the click rate was 28% is now 51%; the conversion rate was 3.5% is now 7.5%)!

The team has agreed that this updated timeframe satisfies our concerns for not wanting to over-engage (bother or annoy) the Veteran.  We are happy to get this launched again!  The VA Notify Strike team will review their Sprint plan and let us know when they can start the launch.
