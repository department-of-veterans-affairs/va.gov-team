     - Money sign is experimental, OK to use 
- Sarah
     - Prototype State is not listed as req field, even tho other wireframes show as listed.  
     - Likes that there is a Prep question, asking again after the task might reveal whether folks felt prepared after navigating the form.  
     - Concerned folks using the same demographic (married w/2 kids) may not reveal other scenarios.  
     - Questions that are not required, why is that? what purpose do they serve? all in the ticket.  
     - Will sync with Cheryl on Language, in case they may not impact our team.
