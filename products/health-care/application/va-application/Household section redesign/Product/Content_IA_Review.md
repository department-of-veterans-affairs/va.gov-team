The Household Information section of the 10-10EZ is the area where we have the largest dropoff.  This is most likely due to the information required and the way requests for that information are presented.  To help address this, we're attempting to restructure the section to make it easier to approach.  This restructuring largely involves the reorganization of the information by grouping questions that are similar to one another to help create a more fluid experience; and by ensuring that there's enough information readily available to help Veterans complete the application.

## When do you expect to launch your product to 100% of users?
