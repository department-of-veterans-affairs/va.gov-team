## 10-10EZ Household section redesign - Team decisions

Nick provided an overview of suggestions for the section, and Heather provided metrics showing applicant dropoffs (page exits) higher for the pages in the Household section, than any other pages in the application.  After reviewing metrics, previous usability and call center feedback, the team agreed that a redesign on the Household section of the 10-10EZ would help make the form easier and less painful to complete.  

This document is to help us decide and track what we have agreed would be beneficial to implement and test.
