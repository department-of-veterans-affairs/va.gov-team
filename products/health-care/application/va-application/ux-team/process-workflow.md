# Process Workflow and Design Decisions

<details>
  
<summary>Ticket Process</summary>

### Ticket Creation
- Ticket creation is not exclusive to PMs - Anyone on the team can create a ticket!
- A ticket should include:
  - Background: Why we are doing this work and any important context
  - Benefit to the Veteran: To continually base our work around user-centered outcomes
  - Resource links: Anything the assignee might need to reference in order to complete the ticket
  - Tasks: A checklist of action items that must be completed before closing the ticket
  - Acceptance criteria: The definition of done for the ticket. This criteria must be met before closing the ticket.
- Refer to the team's [definition of ready](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1v32urMBT9IU7BBZHuLJN3Tap4dTTxSlbxQ38dFWtpYg/edit#slide=id.g2b7676c8a1f_0_0) before starting work on a ticket

### Ticket Refinement and Pointing
- Tickets should be refined prior to being pointed
  - If you're unsure of ticket content and completeness, either have the team review it async via Slack or in biweekly backlog refinement  
- Tickets should be pointed prior to being self-assigned
  - Refer to the team's [guidelines on how to point tickets](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1v32urMBT9IU7BBZHuLJN3Tap4dTTxSlbxQ38dFWtpYg/edit#slide=id.g2652fddd673_0_311)
- Optional but helpful tip: Put initials next to tasks indicating who will complete them if there are multiple assignees to one ticket

### Working On and Completing a Ticket
- Check off task items in the ticket as you complete them so all team members are aware of progress
- Leave comments on tickets to convey decisions made and/or artifacts created that are relevant to the ticket
- Refer to the team's guidelines for [definition of done](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1v32urMBT9IU7BBZHuLJN3Tap4dTTxSlbxQ38dFWtpYg/edit#slide=id.g2330c998e95_0_5) before closing a ticket

<summary>Team/PM/PO Decisions</summary>

### Team/PM Decisions

- It is up to the designer to seek out discussion time with the internal team as needed to keep projects moving along. This is why our work is able to be so autonomous - you're trusted to manage subtasks like this.
- Use Slack for small, straightforward questions or to decide whether a meeting is needed.
- The team has recurring meetings that may be used for smaller discussion points if not much time is needed:
  - Parking lot after stand-up
  - Backlog grooming and sprint planning typically don't run for the full allotted time and can allow for small discussions
  - Can use some time in team retro if your question or topic is still nebulous as far as next steps or how to accomplish
- Don't hesitate to schedule asynchronous meetings with appropriate team members to discuss and make decisions. This is often necessary at some point in the project timeline.
  - It's recommended to do this early on with engineers as you're ideating so they can flag any technical considerations or blockers.
 
### PO Decisions
- Our VA product owner (Patrick Bateman) manages several VA.gov teams. He doesn't need to (and doesn't have the time to) be aware of every detail of our projects but should be aware of the general direction and project timeline.
- Use the 10-10 team<>Product Lead bi-weekly touchbase meeting to update Patrick on any major developments for in-flight projects.
- Slack can also be used to communicate with Patrick for smaller questions that don't require a meeting. He may be slow to respond due to his schedule. If he'll be out for any significant amount of time, the DM puts this on the team calendar.
- There is a weekly PO/PM touchbase meeting that can be used for PO questions if needed. Let your PM know if you'd like them to bring something up to Patrick in that meeting.
  - The PMs post notes from this meeting in Github [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/Meetings/PO_PM%20meeting%20notes).
- If you need to schedule any asynchronous time with Patrick, let the DM (Emily) know so she can schedule it.

<summary>Collab and/or CAIA review</summary>

### Collaboration Cycle
- Since the nature of our work is typically making updates to existing forms or creating new products/features that have a government mandated deadline, we often don't use the collaboration cycle.
- If we were working on a new major feature or form that didn't have a tight deadline and incorporated components and integrations that we net new to the team, this would be an appropriate use case for the collab cycle.
- For more info on the collaboration cycle, how to kick off and how to navigate all the steps, see [Platform documentation](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/).

### CAIA Review
- We must have a content SME from CAIA review our work any time that content is changing.
- The typical cycle for a health enrollment project involves CAIA review instead of the full collaboration cycle.
- See our [content collaboration process](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/ux-team/process-content-collab.md) for more info on what to do to set up for CAIA review, how to submit a ticket, and how to collaborate with content SMEs.

<summary>Stakeholder/SME Accuracy Checks</summary>
<br>
In our project lifecycles, a lot of questions come up that only our subject matter experts (SMEs) can answer for us. We have recurring meetings set up with our stakeholders for our 3 forms and we have alternative ways to get in touch with them outside of those meetings.

### Recurring SME/Stakeholder Meetings

- We have biweekly calls with HEC (health enrollment center) stakeholders who help with the 10-10EZ and EZR forms.
  - We use these calls to ask questions we needs answers to to unblock our work, especially if our questions are easier to discuss in a meeting than in an email and/or the questions are likely easy to answer on the spot.
  - We prepare an agenda prior to this meeting via Slack.
  - It's perfectly fine to share your screen and have open conversation about in-flight designs in these meetings if time allows.
  - We often utilize these meetings to conduct planned workshops with our stakeholders (usually using Mural). **Note:** Don't expect stakeholders to be able to write directly in Mural as they often aren't able to get access. Arrange for someone to take notes in Mural.
- We typically have a biweekly call with our CG (caregiver) stakeholders where we cover questions on in-flight work and upcoming initiatives.
  - We use these the same way as the HEC calls, but the frequency of the calls tends to correlate to whether we're actively working on the 10-10CG form or not. We typically increase these calls to weekly when we're working on the form, and sometimes may skip it for months if there's no active work on the form.
 
### Communicating via Email with SMEs

- When you need an answer to something quick to unblock work, email communication may be the best way to go.
- This is also the best option if you need SMEs to provide extensive feedback or look further into things which may not be possible to answer on the spot in a call.
- Use your best judgement when making asks via email. Remember that our SMEs aren't looking at the online forms every day like we are. They need context in order to digest our questions which may be screenshots or additional explanation. 

### SME Communication Best Practices

- Our SMEs are normal people just like us who all want the best outcomes for Veterans. However, we always try to approach conversations with them in meetings and via email as professionally and buttoned up as possible.
- Put yourself in the stakeholders' shoes and think about what context they will need in order to understand your questions and/or digest your designs.
- **Preparation is key.** Before stakeholder meetings, have any artifacts you need to share pulled up and any questions you plan to ask written down somewhere with space for you to take notes on responses.
  - Make sure you've done your due diligence of looking for answers and information that we already have on hand before asking questions of our stakeholders. 
  - If conducting a stakeholder workshop, workshop materials should be polished and reviewed by the team, our OCTO design lead, and our VA product owner.
  - Lean on your fellow designers, your PM, and our OCTO design lead to provide input on the workshop structure in your planning phase.
  - You may want to do a practice session of a workshop with the team before the meeting.
