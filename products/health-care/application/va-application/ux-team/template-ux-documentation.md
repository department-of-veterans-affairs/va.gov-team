# How-to use the template reference

- Additional context and resources around the sections of the template above. 
- For every initiative / project, PM will create a folder to house relevant documentation. Create a "UX" folder and readme.md file inside of that folder
- Copy the template into the readme.md file
- Add details and maintain through-out project
- Can use UX folder to house additional artifacts as needed (exports of screens, Mural boards, experience maps, etc)



### Key documentation elements
- Background summary
- Current state
- Recent artifacts + deliverables
- Timeline + UX decisions

- Key findings + next steps



### Background summary

## Optional documentation resources 

### Documenting if Figma
- [Example](https://www.figma.com/design/TxXD5bGUOhbHHWLb85GPjK/10-10CG?node-id=1069-27287&t=jbBzAcnDteZG6tgf-4) found in CG file used for 2024 paper form alignment updates

**Documentation can also happen directly in Figma a few different ways:**
  - Section just for design decisions
  - Notes component via the VADS Annotations Library
  - Accessibility annotions via the VADS Annotations Library
  - Content status notes and background via the 1010 shared content library component


### Content status component in Figma
- See more in [content collab process doc](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/ux-team/process-content-collab.md#content-status-component)
- Use to call out changes, questions or considerations
- Use to document content and/or SME decisions and conversations


### Notes Annotation Component
The 1010 team also uses the notes component found in the _VADS Accessibility Annotations Library_ to 
- Identify each page/view in flow
- Title: common name (same as content component)
- Additional details: conditionals + helpful info
- Code: URL of the page



### Accessibility Annotations

- [Accessibility annotations for VA.gov applications](https://design.va.gov/about/accessibility/accessibility-annotations)
- [Figma library](https://www.figma.com/design/CZcnWfQOwtLqPm4WA5paYG/VADS-Web-Annotation-Kit?node-id=415-1135&t=uimVWJ4IGcV0sU75-0)
