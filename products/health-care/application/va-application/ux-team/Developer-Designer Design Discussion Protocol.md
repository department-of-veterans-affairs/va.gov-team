**Developer-Designer Design Discussion Protocol [Draft]** 

*Purpose: Make sure developers and designers are on the same page for the 10-10EZR Form app. We want to spot any design gaps or blockers early on to keep implementation smooth.*

**1. Starting the Conversation:**
- Designers: Ping the relevant developers when new designs are ready to discuss.
- Developers: Reach out to designers if you see potential issues or discrepancies.

**2. Setting Up Meetings:**
- Organize ad hoc meetings when needed, aiming to meet within 48 hours of reaching out.
- Use a shared team calendar to avoid conflicts and ensure all stakeholders can join.

**3. Prepping for the Meeting:**
- Designers:
Share an overview of the new designs, including wireframes, mockups, and intended user flows.
Highlight any assumptions or specific functionality intended.
- Developers:
Look through the existing app logic and design specs.
Note down potential blockers, logical gaps, or other concerns.

**4. Meeting Agenda:**
- Design Recap: Designers walk through the high-level idea of the design.
- Q&A: Devs and designers dig into any questions and clarify functionality.
- Technical Review:
  - Devs call out potential blockers or areas that need extra attention.
  - Both parties brainstorm solutions and tweaks together.
- Consensus: Get on the same page about what needs changing or refining.
- Next Steps: List out action items, who's doing what, and a timeline.

**5. After the Meeting:**
- Designers: Update designs based on feedback and share the revisions with the team.
- Developers: Review the revised designs to ensure they line up with what was discussed.
- PM: Document decisions and next steps for future reference.

**6. Final Sign-Off:**
- Do one last check-in with the team and key stakeholders before signing off.
- Confirm that all blockers are resolved and the design is ready for implementation.

**7. Continuous Improvement:**
- Gather feedback from everyone to improve the process.
- Review and update the protocol regularly to reflect best practices and learnings.
