**Variants to use:**
- When ready for Content to review - RED
- When ready for Development - GREEN
- When pending - in process/SME questions/etc- YELLOW
- General notes: BLUE

### Additional Notes Component
Use the Notes component in VADS Web Annotation Kit 
- To label each screen / page name of the flow for review
- Callout any other changing elements like URLs/fields added or removed/specific changes



## Process experiment: 

1. Designer setup Figma page with all components and notes to start content collab 
2. Designer/PM open CAIA ticket 
3. Designer walk through the request and the screens in Figma at a weekly Friday content sync meeting 
4. Content can adjust in content source of truth section Figma screens directly or post temporary questions in Figma comments
5. Capture any future state comments or content in the content status component note variant
6. Can change color of note or content components to call out SME questions and answers (chat as team on future direction)
7. When in Pending used details section to add reasoning why
8. Change to ready to development as pages are approved
9. Tag engineer in FE ticket once designs/content are approved
