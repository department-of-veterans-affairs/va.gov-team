## How we work 


### Processes

- [Content collab process](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/ux-team/process-content-collab.md)
- [Design decisions and workflow](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/ux-team/process-workflow.md)
- [Source of truth design/content files](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/ux-team/process-source-of-truth.md)


### Tools used

#### Figma 
Where screen designs and prototypes can be created.   
- [Link to Health Enorllment Project Room](https://www.figma.com/files/team/1278375444205744118/project/175597680/Healthcare-Benefits-Applications?fuid=1070808939264105970)

- Files separated by Product, Shared Content and Archive

File Organization + Naming
- The pages listed at the top under the _Source of Truth_ section header should always match what is in production
- Under the _Work + Tickets_ header, include a short name and the ticket number when naming the page.
- There are additional naming conventions noted in the [Figma file notes page](https://www.figma.com/design/UljiHam46o5DItC5iDgmPd/10-10EZ?node-id=3347-33475&t=gfTdB6dw3usNzHme-0)

#### Mural 
Used for research synthesis, user flows and other collaboration or presentation needs. 

- [1010 Room](https://app.mural.co/invitation/room/1670613238628?code=a67c337f0cd645d18b1b99d77f3743e1&sender=uadf1ed7fe7c76f0914967329)
- In the 1010 Health Enrollment Mural Room, there are folders organized by product and one for team use.

Each product folder has sub-folders for:
1. Source of truth user flows, error messages
2. Research synthesis boards
3. Discovery boards
4. Sub folders as needed by topic


#### Github 

Folders
- For each new initiative/epic, the Project Manager will create a folder in the product github product folder ([EZ/EZR](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/application/va-application) and [CG](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/caregivers))
- Designers will add a **ux folder and a readme.md** file for each initiative that has a UX impact and follow guidelines in documentation process
- Keep relevant links to artifacts and tickets organized on this readme file


Tickets
- Add a link to all the relevant UX tickets from the UX readme.md file
- In the Figma file, create a documentation/notes annotation and add links to relevant tickets there as well
