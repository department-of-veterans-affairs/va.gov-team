# Project Outline - HCA Address Project (2020)
This has been implemented before 5/2022
---

## Overview
We're going to update the Healthcare Application (HCA) on VA.gov to collect mailing address and home address, to allow the Healthcare Eligibility Center (HEC) to make healthcare eligibility decisions faster.

## Problem Statement

There should be a way for the HEC to distinguish between mailing and residential addresses for Veterans applying for healthcare, so that the HEC can determine how best to communicate with Veteran applicants.

How might we encourage Veterans to provide both mailing and residental addresses on their application so that the HEC can best provide healthcare benefits?

## Assumptions/Questions
1. Why do we need both addresses?
1. What is the buisness process after you collect the addresses?
1. We use “mailing” and “home” address in profile and across VA.gov - assume we can use it in this effort - Is that the case?   
1. Why does the user have to enter Name/Birthdate/Social Security number before entering application? 
1. What are other methods of communication to use to communicate with Veterans?
1. How should the experience differ between authenticated and unauthenticated? 

## Desired User Outcomes

- Veteran can enter both a mailing address and home address on the online healthcare application.
- Veterans can recieve a decision on their application faster.
- Veterans who have a mailing address separate from their home address can receive mail and communication from the VA appropriately.

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Additonal burden for Veterans, confusing instructions.

## Desired Business Outcomes

- HEC can determine a Veteran's mailing and home address by looking at their initial healthcare application.
- HEC can communicate with Veteran's faster and make decisions that are informed by home address location.

## Undesired Business Outcomes

- Less usable data

## Measuring Success - Will work on these with the 10-10EZ team.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
* _What are the most important metrics that track with this product/initiative's success?_
* _Include links to Domo or Google Analytics Dashboards/Reports_

#### Baseline KPI Values
* _Baseline values for those most critical metrics. These may come from other systems other than VA.gov e.g. eBenefits._

### Objectives and Key results (OKRs)

## Assumptions
- Collecting both mailing and residential address will make it easier for the HEC to process applications.


## Solution Approach

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
      - So that the online healthcare application can better meet the needs of the HEC.
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
      - Because it solves the problem most directly (rather than trying to pull the data from other sources)
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
       - Other changes to the 10-10EZ, because we want to get this initial change out as fast as possible. 
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*
      - In the future we'd like to take a more in-depth look at the HCA and see how it could better meet the needs of Veterans.
