- Last updated by hdjustice 8/21/2025

#### Overview

This initiative focuses on improving the veteran experience by displaying healthcare application statuses on personalized VA.gov pages beyond the current form introduction page, providing clear guidance on next steps based on application status.

## Outcome Summary

**Increase veteran confidence and clarity in healthcare application process by displaying application statuses on high-traffic personalized pages like MyVA, reducing confusion and support requests.**

## Problem

**What is the problem and who is affected?**
Veterans applying for VA healthcare currently have limited visibility into their application status outside of the form's introduction page. This creates confusion and anxiety as veterans are unsure of their application progress and what actions they need to take next. The problem affects all veterans who have submitted healthcare applications and are waiting for processing or need to take additional action.

- Current VES statuses of Veterans who can access EZR (this is outside of statuses/attributes required by MHV to log into the my-health space)
     - `enrolled`
     - `pending_mt` (this is when pending a means test, financials needed)
     - `pending_other`
- May need to consider looking at `Pending;Unverified`.  
     - See note from Joshua Faulkner: "Pending;Unverified - this status is **temporary** but the totals hover around 150k"
          - We know Veterans get letters when military history cannot be verified after submitting the 10-10EZ application
               - When are these letters triggered?
               - When would we trigger this status, if the status is temporary (after a day, a week, etc)?
               - Can Veterans access the EZR to submit additional information?

**Why do you think the problem is occurring?**
- Application statuses are only displayed on the form introduction page, which veterans may not frequently visit
- MyVA dashboard only shows limited status information (started but not submitted applications, and enrolled status)
- Critical statuses like "application being reviewed" and "declined" are not visible on commonly accessed pages
- Lack of clear guidance on next steps for each status creates uncertainty

**How does this initiative help further OCTO-DE's mission and goals?**
This initiative directly supports OCTO-DE's mission to deliver seamless, proactive, and personalized experiences by:
- Reducing veteran burden through proactive status communication
- Improving service completion rates by providing clear next steps
- Building trust through transparent communication about application progress

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

> ðŸ’¡ *VA.gov products measure success against Ease of use, Service Completion, Trust/Satisfaction, Health.*

- **Ease of Use**: Reduction in support calls related to healthcare application status inquiries | Baseline: [TBD] | Target: 20% reduction
- **Service Completion**: Increase in veterans completing required follow-up actions | Baseline: [TBD] | Target: 15% increase
- **Trust/Satisfaction**: Veteran satisfaction scores for healthcare application process | Baseline: [TBD] | Target: 10% improvement
- **Health**: Reduction in time from application submission to enrollment completion | Baseline: [TBD] | Target: 5% reduction

**Balancing Metrics:**
- Page load performance on MyVA (ensure new status displays don't impact performance)
- Error rates for status data retrieval

---

## Discovery

### Assumptions/Risks

**Value Risks** (will people use it):
- Veterans will find status information on personalized pages more useful than current placement
- Clear next-step guidance will reduce veteran anxiety and confusion
- *Validation*: User research and usability testing with veterans

**Usability Risks** (can people figure out how to use it):
- Status information and next steps are presented clearly and understandably
- Integration with existing MyVA design doesn't create confusion
- *Validation*: Usability testing and A/B testing of different presentation approaches

**Technical Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data):
- Reliable access to real-time healthcare application status data
- API performance with volume of status checks (150k pending unverified, 105k pending MT)
- Integration capabilities with existing MyVA infrastructure
- *Validation*: Technical spike and API performance testing

**Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact):
- Stakeholder alignment on status display locations and messaging
- Compliance with VA healthcare privacy requirements
- Coordination with healthcare enrollment teams for accurate status definitions
- *Validation*: Stakeholder interviews and compliance review

### Supporting research

This work is requested by Design Lead (Lois Lewis) based on identified user needs. Additional user research should be conducted to:
- Validate veteran preferences for status information placement
- Test comprehension of status messaging and next steps
- Understand veteran mental models for application progress
- Identify any additional statuses or information veterans need

This work is supported by existing research:
- [VFF and MyVA submission statuses research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22DSP%3A+Help%20users%20to%20stay%20informed%20of%20app%20status%22)
- Design Lead (Lois Lewis) request based on identified user needs
- Existing MyVA form status patterns and research from Benefits forms work

### What're you building?

**In scope:**
- Display of healthcare application statuses ('In Process,' 'Enrolled,' 'Declined,' 'Pending more information') on appropriate VA.gov personalized pages
- Clear guidance on next steps for each status
- Possible integration with existing MyVA healthcare section
- Additional notifications through VA Notify, or working with HEC to develop a staff-side process

**Explicitly not included:**
- Changes to the actual healthcare application form
- Modifications to backend status determination logic
- New notification systems (email/SMS alerts)
- Historical status tracking or timeline views

**How this addresses Assumptions & Risks:**
- User research will validate value and usability assumptions
- Technical spikes will address feasibility concerns
- Stakeholder engagement will ensure organizational viability

### Key Decisions Made
- 2025-09-24 - Met with Mitch on EZ statuses directing to EZR.
    - There's been difficulty in pinpointing the required attributes/statuses that MHV/My-Health relies on to allow access to the my-health.va.gov space, which inhibits our confidence on whether we can direct Veterans to the EZR when more information is needed (such as financials, military documentation).
     - **Next steps**: At this point, we can consider this exploration closed and will look into a development spike to test out use cases on users with different attributes/statuses. Keeping in mind the reduction and restructure of the team, this will be prioritized after Confirmation flow/V2 and Military Service info work.
