### Notes

* Automating outbound?
    * Stephen is looking into the work already done so far (with April Mims?)
        * PPT decks
            * Outbound campaign for apps missing data (this would be pending)
                * Current process - 8, 30, 310 days roster to outbound calls system (autodialer) connects staff & veteran to review over the phone
        * To Be outbound flow (RPA process)
            * Tool would verify email address
            * Keep same campaign roster dates
            * Send out email requesting they provide/fill in info?
            * If email not correct, outbound call is done
        * April was talking emails only, no texts.. But it could happen
            * Email generated thru this process, pls contact us
            * CRM will need to decide how it will fold into their process
            * New contract being created for the team to reconvene    
        * Angela would like a prompt in the email/text to go on VA.gov and complete EZR (still pending CYOA flow) - ideal user flow
            * Receive email with link
            * Log in
            * Some sort of alert that they need to complete EZR
            * Prefilled with whatever we can prefill
            * Fill out whatever is needed (financials), not need to fill out anything else
            * Hit submit

### Next Steps
* With "Pending MT" and "Pending Other" statuses confirmed to access EZR online, the action now can be to update the script for outbound calling to direct Veterans to the EZR online.
    * Emails/Texts can come after, will be worked on from HEC side.
* Pending will be done before Welcome
    * We’ll see how this goes before starting on Welcome
    * Not enough staff to work on outbound calls for Welcome

Action items
- [x] Alex confirmed EZR can accept statuses "Enrolled", "Pending_MT" and "Pending_Other"
- [ ] Need to revamp “Pending” alerts on EZ and Profile
