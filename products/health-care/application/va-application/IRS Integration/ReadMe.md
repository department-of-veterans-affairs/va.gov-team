## Problem
> *Describe the challenge / pain point you seek to address.:* 
* What is the problem and who is affected? And, what evidence do we have of the problem?
* Why do you think the problem is occurring? Other reasons why this might be occurring?
* How does this initiative help further OCTO-DE's mission and goals?

- Veterans do not want to provide their income details for various reasons
     - Fear of benefits denial based on income level
     - Fear of taking benefits away from other deserving Veterans because of income level
     - Fear of benefits denial because last year's earnings do not reflect this year's income level
     - Do not want VA to have this kind of information, believe it to be unnecessary
     - Do not want to take the time to find the income or medical deductible data
     - Veteran is not the primary financials handler, and needs to consult spouse/significant other
<!--
## Desired User Outcomes
- *Why would a user want to use this?*
- *With this problem solved, what should users be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*
- Veterans will opt-in to allow VA.gov to pull last year's income from IRS
- Veterans will feel less burden to locate/calculate the income data themselves

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Veterans will feel this is too much of a violation of privacy
- Veterans will not opt-in to allow IRS to send the income details and will also not provide their income details themselves

## Desired Business Outcomes
- *Why would your business want this to exist?*
- *With this problem solved, what should your business be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*
- More accurate income reporting being received directly from IRS
- Less burden on processing, since the income verification step would be unnecessary

## Discovery
### Assumptions/Risks
> *Identify risks related to usability, value to users, feasibility/implementation, and viability given organizational constraints<sup>2</sup>. 
> Indicate how you'll validate/test against these risks. Inspired by [SVPG's Four Big Risks](https://www.svpg.com/four-big-risks/).*

- **Value Risks** (will people use it): 
  - Veterans may not like the idea of VA obtaining data directly from IRS
  - Veterans may not know or understand where the Income value comes from (what field, what document from IRS)
  
- **Usability Risks** (can people figure out how to use it):
  - .
  
- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data):
  - May need to build additional technology to integrate with IRS systems, including additonal security
  
- **Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact):
  - VA stakeholder End-to-end testing
  - Compliance concerns on obtaining this data from IRS, will most likely require explicit Opt-In language
