## Problem
There are still Veterans either not completing the application due to additional information that is required but may not be necessary; or may not be completing due to the amount of time required to complete the application.
Expanding access to the short form will remove questions that are not necessary for more circumstances, and reduce the amount of time and effort required to complete the initial form.

## Desired User Outcomes
- Shorten the amount of time taken to complete the application.
- Reduce the number of visits required to complete the application.

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Confusion about what information needs to be provided and what doesn't.

## Desired Business Outcomes
- Fewer applications are abandoned.

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- Confusion on what information needs to be filled out, leading to Veterans abandoning applications.

## Measuring Success

### Objective: More health care applications submitted.

Data source - [10-10EZ Domo Dashboard](https://va-gov.domo.com/page/447193050)

**Key Result 1:** Increase number of application submissions
*Using last 6 months (TBD) to calculate Baselines*
| KPI / Metric | Baseline: TBD | Post-launch Week 1 | Post-launch Month 1 |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| Avg. Application starts per Month |  | TBD | TBD |
| Avg. Submissions per Month | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Pct. Applications Completed | TBD | TBD | TBD |

**Key Result 2:** Reduce Sesssions / Time taken to complete application 
| KPI / Metric | Baseline: TBD | Post-launch Week 1 | Post-launch Month 1 |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| Avg. Sessions per Submission | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Avg. Single sessions per Month | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Avg. 2 sessions per Month | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Avg. 3 or more sessions per Month | TBD | TBD | TBD |

**Key Result 3:** Reduce abandoned applications

*To calculate, check how many people started the application (use the actual number, not the gimongous number) and compare it to how many people left during the Service info/household information section (viewers of Service Information page minus views of Medicaid/Medicare page, then determine %)*
| KPI / Metric | Baseline: TBD | Post-launch Week 1 | Post-launch Month 1 |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| Avg. Applications Abandoned per month | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Pct. Applications Abandoned per month | TBD | TBD | TBD |

## Discovery
### Assumptions/Risks

- **Value Risks** (will people use it): 
  - The value risk that Veterans may become confused when they transition to the short form, and spend time looking for where to input the information that is no longer necessary.
- **Usability Risks** (can people figure out how to use it):
  - There is a risk that the incorrect military service will be selected, meaning they might not fill out the correct version of the form.
- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data):
   - None
  
- **Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact):
  - Increase in application submissions.


### Solution Summary
- In-scope:
     - Implementation factors TBD
- Out of scope:
     - Any clean-up / changes to the existing form.
