## Problem
Veterans are either not completing the application due to additional information that is required but may not be necessary; or may not be completing due to the amount of time required to complete the application.
The introduction of the short form will remove questions that are not necessary for a given Veteran's circumstances, and reduce the amount of time and effort required to complete the initial form.

## Desired User Outcomes
- Shorten the amount of time taken to complete the application.
- Reduce the number of visits required to complete the application.

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Confusion about what information needs to be provided and what doesn't.

## Desired Business Outcomes
- Fewer applications are abandoned.

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- Confusion on what information needs to be filled out, leading to Veterans abandoning applications.

## Discovery
### Assumptions/Risks

- **Value Risks** (will people use it): 
  - The value risk that Veterans may become confused when they transition to the short form, and spend time looking for where to input the information that is no longer necessary.
- **Usability Risks** (can people figure out how to use it):
  - There is a risk that the incorrect disability rating will be selected, meaning they might not fill out the correct version of the form.
- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data):
   - None
  
- **Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact):
  - Increase in application submissions.


### Solution Summary
- In-scope:
     - Implementation of short form for users with a disability rating equal to or greater than 50% based on information stored in the user's profile.
     - Implementation of short form for users with a disability rating equal to or greater than 50% based on self-disclosed information.
     - Implementation of short form for users with a combat veteran status (TBD).
- Out of scope:
     - Implementation of the short form for any other reasons.
     - Any clean-up / changes to the existing form.
