## Oct 11, 2023 | CR# VES-24470 - Create Registration Only Form on va.gov

### VES Team
- Shawn Edwards - Biz Analyst lead
- Ashuntus Frye BA
- Kevin Palmer - PO

### Notes
- Different from enrollment
- Will be a different service call, VES is creating a Registration service call
- Requires only a small set of fields, compared to EZ
- Is the Veteran planning to have a subsidized plan on HC.gov and VA health care?
      - Would be kicked off HC.gov plan. Could have monetary penalties for Veteran.
