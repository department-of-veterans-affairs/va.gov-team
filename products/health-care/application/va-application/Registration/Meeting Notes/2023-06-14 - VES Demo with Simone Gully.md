## 6/14/2023 VES demo with Simone Gully (care of VES Modernization team!)

### Notes
- Simone Gully provided demo of how to add a Veteran for Enrollment in VES

- Search - SSN, LN, FN, Birth sex
     - Add new person (if not found)
     - Enter everything on application
          - Includes Veteran indicator (Y, N)
          - Enrollment route = Y
               - Doing a lot of Registration for non Veterans and collaterals, those that go to Emergency Room
          - Do not use Address fields here, use something else for validation
     - Search done to see if any possible matches, if none then “add”
          - Search VBA for any other possible matches with service history

- After adding the initial record, go to Eligibility (then Demographics, then Enrollment = Complete pages Left to Right, Top to Bottom)
     - Veteran indicator Y/N carries over
     - Enrollment path = Y to Do you wish to enroll
          - Based on this question, will determine what additional fields will populate
     - Once set, it must be cancelled or declined before changing to No, MUST BE IN WRITING BEFORE CANCELLING/DECLINING - Painpoint for Veteran
          - This includes when the staff member has marked Y in error
     - Eligibility status - Enrollment = Pending Verification (always)
          - For Registration Only = Verified
     - Reason - for adding new person, always select “Pending proof of military service”
          - If Reg Only = Verified, Reason disappears
- Go to Demographics
     - Identity Traits tab (MVI owns this term) - One hour allowed to complete page and details
          - If a change is needed after one hour, must open MVI Toolkit ticket to have the data corrected
          - Name, SSN, Birth sex, SIGI, DOB, Place of Birth CIty and state, Mother maiden name, race, ethnicity
          - Pseudo SSN reason is used only when non-veteran
     - Personal tab
          - Emergency response used as directed (last time was hurricane katrina)
          - Benefit applied for - dropdown = enrollment (has other options like dental)
          - Revenue team will manage indian health question
          - Employment status - this is not on Online form
               - Asks for employer, and address info
     - Address tab
          - Enter Mailing address first
               - If homeless or no address, enter facility address and have Other for Bad address reason (indicator)
               - If mail comes back, bad address reason = undeliverable
               - There is a field for “Source of change” - VAMC, HEC, etc
                    - If VAMC, must enter Site
               - Mailing and Residential are required
               - If provided PO Box only, Residential address will be the Facility
          - Confidence level should be above 80% on address validation
          - Can still add even if not found
     - Associates tab
          - If provided (not on online form)
          - NoK, Emergency contact, Guardian, Attorney (POA or other legal representative)
     - Insurance tab
          - Private and Medicare
          - Interesting that this data point is under Demographics
- Save input, then perform searches again with all data partners to see if the new record saved, and if any other records come up.
- Go to Enrollment
     - Military tab
          - If data was found from VBA, will populate (including whether they are active duty)
          - Discharge due to disability and Military Disability retirement questions are either verified with VBA or DD214
          - Agent Orange and Radiation dropdowns used for Pact Act
          - Eligible for Class II Dental Y/N = 90 days from separation date to receive dental care
          - Getting ready to add “Uncharacterized” to the discharge character list
          - Period of service is based on separation date
     - Financial tab
          - Income year already set (last year, no matter what the current date is)
          - SSN is required for dependents including spouse for income verification
          - Test effective date = application signature date
          - Facilities approve hardships
          - IVM - if done, data would be shown
          - Co-pay exempt/non-exempt will show
          - Means test will show if dr visit copay is exempt
          - Thresholds are based on residential address
     - Eligibility tab
          - Verify record
          - If priority group 8B or 8G, keep on Pending Verification
          - Active duty, blue water, demobilization, OTH and Pact will stay on Pending
          - When changing to verified, method (DD214, etc) is entered
          - Must have service connected evaluation (most recent) with disability rating
          - Have to add SC disabilities for calculations for Community care and Copays
          - Can enter other non-veteran indicators (if Veteran and employee for example)

- For the schedule an appointment question; Say yes, populates date and added to the near list to be contacted to schedule first appt
     - From a Veterans POV, what is the expectations of process and turn-around time when they need to schedule an appointment?
     - Would registration only paths potentially have a higher demand/need to be seen sooner for care?
     - Is this a question that is asked on the registration path within the staff ES system?
     - Would a person who is in the 'registration only' such as ER or other urgent medical situation, find an online path to register for care at a VA Facility something they would even think of doing beforehand?
