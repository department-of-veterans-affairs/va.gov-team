## 5-16-23 Notes from high-level chat on Registration Only

- Must be registered as a patient, get a chart created, etc,  in order to recv care
- There are 2 ways to recv care - enrolled in full health ben pkg, or just have to be registered
- Top of list reasons to register - 50% greater disability - register, get all the care (SHORT FORM)
- More $$ attached to enrollees than registered
     - This is an issue, pressure on VA to clean up process
- The work here seems to be mostly UX and some UI to provide info and option


- Examples of Registering but not necessarily needing medical care
     - VA can vaccinate CG and Family members from COVID - Humanitarian
     - In Service, are/were exposed to environmental hazards,  assessment - create chart
          - Open to any Veteran
     - High Suicide risk

- We could find out that most of the time, people are "registered" when they visit a facility for urgent or emergency care and have not yet been registered or enrolled in VA health care. 
     - This doesn't change the regulatory requirement to have the "Registration Only" option available online
