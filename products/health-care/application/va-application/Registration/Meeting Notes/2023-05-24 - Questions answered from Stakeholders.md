### Registration Only - open questions

 

#### Registration -vs- Enrollment
- What benefit does "registering" provide?                                                                                                
     - What do you get with Registration vs Enrollment? 
          - **ANSWER**: Veterans requesting an eligibility assessment, clinical evaluation, care or treatment pursuant to a special treatment authority provided in 38 C.F.R. 17.37:
- Confirm - this is for both Active Duty Service Members and Veterans?
- Is this the first and only time the Veteran will see these terms used?     
     - **CLARIFYING QUESTION**: What terms are you referring to? Registration Only?                                                                                          
     - If so, do they even need to know about these terms at all?
- How do Service Members/Veterans know if they need to complete the 10-10EZ for "Registration Only"?       
     - **ANSWER**: There are instructions on the paper form for Registration Only that we will use.       
          - Registration - For Registrations, only complete Sections I, II, and III. Enrollment not required - Veterans requesting an eligibility assessment, clinical evaluation, care or treatment pursuant to a special treatment authority provided in 38 C.F.R. 17.37:

               - A veteran who was discharged or released from active military service for a disability incurred or aggravated in the line of duty can receive VA care for the 12-month period following discharge or release
               - Care for a Veteran participating in VA's vocational rehabilitation program under 38 U.S.C. 31   
- Do they understand why/what scenario they are in that calls for the Reg Only pathway, especially as opposed to enrollment?
 

#### Data Analysis
- Do we have a way to understand the differences in applicants in the following ways: 
     - Active service member vs veteran
     - Disability rating
     - Reasons for registration in the first place
          - **ANSWER**: No, when the data comes they go into Registration Only and we will use the reasoning of Clinical Evaluation.

#### Processing
- What is the process if the Veteran registers but wants to enroll "Later"? 
     - **ANSWER**: enroll the Veteran
- What is the process for when a Veteran is determined ineligible for enrollment, but eligible to register? 
     - **CLARIFYING QUESTION**: Can you please provide some clarification on this question.
- What information is needed to register?  (Paper form indicates Sections I, II, III) 
     - **ANSWER**: Online should also provide Sections I, II and III) NOTE: would still want the system to do the check for military information.
