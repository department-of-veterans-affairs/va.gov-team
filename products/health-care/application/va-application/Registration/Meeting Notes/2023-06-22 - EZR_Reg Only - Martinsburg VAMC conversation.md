### Notes

- Reg Only
     - Describe Reg only process that is done today
          - It is a little complicated with Reg Only
          - Veterans are not sure which it is
          - Staff knows
          - We get very few that are Reg Only 
               - Military/active duty service members
     - Registered, then enroll
          - Yes, transitional care team for newly transitioned veterans
          - Come into office and sign EZ which confirms they are now enrolled (can be online too)
     - Do Veterans know and understand PG?
          - Once enrolled, we do give handbook with PG, 
          - We immediately go over benefits & understand their PG eligibility (esp copays)
     - For Reg only, is there a communication process
          - MST or Mental Health - they may know or understand the reg only process/benefits
          - Humanitarian/Emergency room - register until they can enroll
     - Are there any questions asked to get them to register over enrollment
          - No, 9/10 times, they will enroll
          - We dont come across it often
     - Benefit to the Veteran to Reg vs Enroll
          - They can be clinically seen
          - MST/Mental health scenario above
          - Domiciliary needs can be received via reg only
          - Patient advocate will send AD - soon to transition with future discharge date
          - Folks see the 2 boxes at the top - confused on these
               - When they make an appointment, they are xferred to eligibility to be enrolled
               - Staff member says she clicks enroll
               - I feel like that box is really confusing for them
               - Veterans get confused of the process of moving from Reg to Enrollment
               - Lots of back & forth
               - Why do the boxes have to be there? (paper form)
Magic wand
     - EZR - choosing whether they want to disclosed their financial information
          - I dont think it is on the EZR, only EZ 
          - Ex: means test on EZR, expenses was left blank (no zeros) - not sure if they forgot or they had no expenses?
          - They were put in a PG5, hope they don't get IVM’d

- EZR
     - Are they cross-referenced with IRS data or only certain circumstances?
          - Can’t answer this really - it seems like it may be random, but I thought it was all Veterans
          - Seen when income provided from Veteran, but later IVM kicked them out of the higher PG
               - Sometimes quick/automatic, sometimes a month later
     - Typical update process
          - Some bring filled out EZR, some just show up
               - Alot know they have to update regularly, but many dont know they have to
               - Mainly for copay exemption and travel reimbursement
     - Frustrations/painpoints
          - When they are receiving bills for copays, they come in to update because they dont think they should be paying those
     - Update portions of the form?
          - No, havent really seen that, they usually update as a whole
     - Anything to trigger for Veteran to update
          - If not updated since 2011, A letter went out for updating to get travel reimbursement
          - Bills for copays
          - No phone calls or other letters are done
     - Once an update has been completed, any notification?
          - We do have a sheet we mail to them to let them know we have updated, whether copay exempt, geo means test required or copay required
          - HEC may have something else
          - No emails due to security
     - Update demographics
          - Update at the desk (we dont do updates by phone)
               - Transferred to HEC
          - A form being partially completed is a rare occurrence
     - For Copay/travel pay associated with any PG
          - PG 5 - Would only have to provide income once, should not have to do that every year
          - PG 3, 4 or not service connected - has to update each year due to pension threshold
          - Any other PG (other than 1 and 2) - has to update means
     - Preferences to update
          - Alot of phone calls - HEC is only group to update over phone (has to call them)
               - Wait times can be really lengthy
               - Call us back upset with the wait
          - Via paper form/mail
          - Walk-in
     - Having EZR online would be helpful to Veterans who are computer savvy
          - Alot of older Veterans like to come in person
          - Would alleviate call wait times for HEC
          - Would alleviate in-prson for those who can update online
     - Does means test include deductibles with income
          - It can mean deductibles as well
