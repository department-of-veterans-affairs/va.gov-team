     - Definitions:
          - **Registration**: Adding a Veteran or Patient into ES or the VA's electronic health record for the purpose of receiving services at a VA medical facility.  Registration in ES must be completed prior to enrollment.
          - **Veteran**: A person who Served in the active military, naval, or air service and was discharged or released from service under conditions other than dishonorable.
- Stakeholder request:
     - >Desired Functionality:** The online form will be a short form to collect the Veterans information Name, SSN, DOB, Address, Phone Number, Military Service Dates and Reason for Registration Only. This information will feed into VES and place the Veteran in a Registration Only status if they do not wish to enroll. If the Veteran is already known to the system we will capture and update existing information if it is different.
       >
     - >Capture and retain a 1010EZ Registration application when received online.
       >
     - >Create service to receive online form data from VA.gov for Veterans who do not wish to enroll and provide that data to VistA/Millennium. In alignment with PACT Act, COMPACT, SERVICE Act and 38 CFR 17.37 this enables Veterans to request an appointment and register for those not wishing to enroll.

### MVP scope - to implement prior to Enrollment system development
- For Veterans with 40% or lower disability rating, we will prompt them within the application asking whether they want to seek care for their service-connected disability/injury only or enroll in VA health care for full benefits.  If they choose service-connected care only, we will display an on-screen message directing them to call, download the PDF form and mail in or visit a facility to register for Service-connected care.
     - Priority of contact methods confirmed with HEC stakeholders on 4/10/2024 (#1 call, #2 mail, #3 visit in-person at facility)
     - The Veteran will have the option to go back within the application and make a different selection to proceed through the application for VA health care enrollment

- Decided as a team and shared with PO on 4/8/2024 with verbal approval, confirmed on 4/17/2024 with written approval

- Shared with HEC Stakeholders on 4/10/2024, receiving verbal excitment and approvals



## Problem
There is an interest from the HEC (Health Eligibilty Center) and VEO (Veteran Experience Office) stakeholders to include a registration-only pathway for the online 10-10EZ application.

## Desired User Outcomes
- Provide Veterans the ability to register for and receive VA medical care without enrolling in VA Health Care

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Confusion between what it means to register vs. enroll, and whether the online application should be used for one or the other.

## Desired Business Outcomes
- Receive online form data from VA.gov for Veterans who do not wish to enroll to enable faster processing

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- Receive online enrollment applications from VA.gov for Veterans who are eligible to register but not eligible to enroll

### Assumptions/Risks
> *Identify risks related to usability, value to users, feasibility/implementation, and viability given organizational constraints<sup>2</sup>. 
> Indicate how you'll validate/test against these risks. Inspired by [SVPG's Four Big Risks](https://www.svpg.com/four-big-risks/).*

- **Value Risks** (will people use it): 
  - Applicants will not understand the difference between Enrollment and Registration, and which applies to them


- **Usability Risks** (can people figure out how to use it):
  - Applicants will not understand the difference between Enrollment and Registration, and which applies to them


- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data):
  - Examples:
    - Upstream/Downstream API/Data availability and reliability
    - Site performance impacts (see [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse), [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/), #-daily-lighthouse-scan)
  
- **Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact):
  - Examples: 
    - VA stakeholder testing, marketing, compliance requirements 

### What're you building
**MVP - In Scope:**
- Reorganized pages for authenticated and unauthenticated user flows to bring forward Compensation and Registration decision sooner within the application
- Target audience for Veterans with 40% or lower service-connected disability rating
- Create an alert with details on how to register for VA health care

**MVP - Out of Scope:**
- Target audience outside of Veterans with 40% or lower service-connected disability rating
- Passing any "Registration" data through to Enrollment system
- Changing the schema in any way
- Prefill
- Systematic decisions or prompting based on any other criteria other than disability rating (such as having private insurance)
