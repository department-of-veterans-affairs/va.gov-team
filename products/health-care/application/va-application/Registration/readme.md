## Problem
There is an interest from the VHA to include a registration-only pathway for the online 10-10EZ application.  While most of the desired use cases are not a fit for integrating into the online application, one is: allowing Veterans who are transitioning out of service to "pre-file" their 10-10EZ application prior to their separation date so that the application can be processed at that time.

## Desired User Outcomes
- Provide Veterans the ability to complete the 10-10EZ form prior to their separation date and be confident the application will be processed once they have left service.

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Confusion between what it means to register vs. enroll, and whether the online application should be used for one or the other.
