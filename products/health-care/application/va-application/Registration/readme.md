     - Definitions:
          - **Registration**: Adding a Veteran or Patient into ES or the VA's electronic health record for the purpose of receiving services at a VA medical facility.  Registration in ES must be completed prior to enrollment.
          - **Veteran**: A person who Served in the active military, naval, or air service and was discharged or released from service under conditions other than dishonorable.
- Stakeholder request:
     - >**Desired Functionality:** The online form will be a short form to collect the Veterans information Name, SSN, DOB, Address, Phone Number, Military Service Dates and Reason for Registration Only. This information will feed into VES and place the Veteran in a Registration Only status if they do not wish to enroll. If the Veteran is already known to the system we will capture and update existing information if it is different.
       >
     - >Capture and retain a 1010EZ Registration application when received online.
       >
     - >Create service to receive online form data from VA.gov for Veterans who do not wish to enroll and provide that data to VistA/Millennium. In alignment with PACT Act, COMPACT, SERVICE Act and 38 CFR 17.37 this enables Veterans to request an appointment and register for those not wishing to enroll.

### MVP
- Allow Active Duty Service Members with a discharge date within 365 days of the current date to "register" for care
     - The current 10-10EZ online form allows applicants to enter a future discharge date within 365 days of current date.
     - We do not inform the applicant that this is not an enrollment path, but a registration only.
     - Need to understand how best to communicate this and what processes happen once the discharge date has been reached
- Allow Veterans, who want to seek care for their service-connected disability/injury only, to "register" for care
     - If the Veteran has a 40% or lower disability rating, they may want to receive care for their service connected disability only.
     - The Veteran may have other means to obtain private health care outside of their service-connection


## Problem
There is an interest from the HEC (Health Eligibilty Center) and VEO (Veteran Experience Office) stakeholders to include a registration-only pathway for the online 10-10EZ application.

_**We need more information on why Registration is used as opposed to enrollment, and what benefit is being provided/problem is being solved_**

## Desired User Outcomes
- Provide Active-Duty Service members and Veterans the ability to register for VA medical care without enrolling in VA Health Care
- 

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Confusion between what it means to register vs. enroll, and whether the online application should be used for one or the other.

## Desired Business Outcomes
- Receive online form data from VA.gov for Veterans who do not wish to enroll to enable faster processing
- 

## Undesired Business Outcomes
TBD

## Discovery
### Registration Use Cases
These are the following confirmed use cases for registration over enrollment. 

- Veteran who is already enrolled/registered in one facility and wants/needs to change facilities.
- Active duty service member with TRICARE.
- Active duty service member getting a Comp & Pen Exam.
- Active duty service member getting care where there is a sharing agreement in place between the DoD and VA.
- Active duty service member getting VA care within a "Military Treatment Facility."
- Registration of collaterals (family members, ex: SAVE Lives Act).
- Active duty transitioning out with a future discharge date (up to 365 days).
- Veterans requesting an eligibility assessment
- Veterans requesting an clinical evaluation PP (Presumptive Psychosis) and/or MST (Military Sexual Trauma)
- Veterans requesting an care or treatment pursuant to a special treatment authority
- Veteran that only wants to be seen for service-connected condition and doesn't want to enroll in VA healthcare.
- HUD-VASH, some Veterans who might not be eligible because of character of discharge, but can be seen.
- Mental health evaluation/services within a year of separation (OTH MENTAL HEALTH).
- Employees (Veterans and non-Veterans)
- Humanitarian cases

### Outstanding questions
- What benefit does "registering" provide?
     - What do you get with Registration vs Enrollment?
- Confirm - this is for both Active Duty Service Members **and** Veterans?
- Is this the first and only time the Veteran will see these terms used?  
     - If so, do they even need to know about these terms at all?
- How do Service Members/Veterans know if they need to complete the 10-10EZ for "Registration Only"?
     - Do they understand why/what scenario they are in that calls for the Reg Only pathway, especially as opposed to enrollment? 
- What are the current volumes of monthly registration vs enrollment applications?
     - What are the volumes of registration approvals, follow-ups (if any) and denials?
     - What are the top 3-5 scenarios/use cases with the most registration-only applications?
- Can a Veteran in good health with no service-connected disabilties or injuries be eligible for VA Health Care or at least obtain care at a VA medical facility?
     - Does their discharge character impact whether they can receive this care?



### Assumptions/Risks
> *Identify risks related to usability, value to users, feasibility/implementation, and viability given organizational constraints<sup>2</sup>. 
> Indicate how you'll validate/test against these risks. Inspired by [SVPG's Four Big Risks](https://www.svpg.com/four-big-risks/).*

- **Value Risks** (will people use it): 
  - Applicants will not understand the difference between Enrollment and Registration, and which applies to them


- **Usability Risks** (can people figure out how to use it):
  - Applicants will not understand the difference between Enrollment and Registration, and which applies to them


- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data):
  - Examples:
    - Upstream/Downstream API/Data availability and reliability
    - Site performance impacts (see [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse), [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/), #-daily-lighthouse-scan)
  
- **Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact):
  - Examples: 
    - VA stakeholder testing, marketing, compliance requirements
