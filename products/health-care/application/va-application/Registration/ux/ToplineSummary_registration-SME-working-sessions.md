**The goal of this document is:**

 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jumpstart synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

## Summary

### Service-connected 

**Finding #1 - There is a process in the works to "register" Veterans in VHA when they first apply for a disabilty claim.**

- Follow up with HEC stakeholders on knowldege of timing of this change
- How will this impact their process / systems?
- How will this impact Veteran enrollment statuses?
- Would the VA.gov registration pathway need to account for the service-connected use case when launched?


**Finding #2 - Marketplace insurance impact**

- For Veterans with a disability rating over 50%, choosing between Registration or Enrollment impacts them depending on if they also have marketplace insurance
- The ACA issue is if a Veteran has a secondary Marketplace insurance they can lose benefits if they are enrolled (and not registered) in VA health care 

> "Due to ACA, Registered can be seen and not impact on the marketplace. If you are Enrolled, you received a stipend due to low income, you’ll get a penalty for Enrollment”


**Finding #3 - Service connected under 50% need to submit financials to enroll**

- If "REGISTERED" does the Veteran need to consent to copays still? and/or provide income info for SC meds?
  - Yes, but don’t need to do the financial disclosure piece.

> "We need financial info to determine how far they want to carry their benefits."

> "We get lots of questions [at the call center] on how VA health care impacts other insurance and if there are additional costs. Does this affect my medicare?"

**Ideal State Notes**

- Ideal state for SC - from disability rating / awards letter - link to accept copay and agreements

> "Just ask if they wish to enroll (for service connected group). If they say no, ask if they want an appointment for screening. Then ask what type of appointment they want."

>  "Let them know, legally, if you registered, you only receive care for your service-connected claims. If you enroll, you get full health services."

> "There should be a Yes/No and disclosure about copays [for under 40%]."

> "Did you serve more than 24 months?” "The biggest hindrance for them is that the information is not in the system. DOD did not update, VBA did not update."


----


### Mental Health

**Finding #1 - Veterans are unaware of what mental health care is available and VA definitions throw Veterans off**

- Veterans have to meet basic eligibility criteria to register
- They can be seen on humanitarian basis if not and will be given resources for community support
  
> "They have to ask. They can call in and they will ask if they want to register or enroll."

**Finding #2 - Having to go through Primary Care can be a pain point**

- Pain point: Veterans have to go through primary care for everything and can't always just get seen for mental health care. This takes extra time to see their PCP first.

> "Yes; they can be referred directly to mental health care but still need to see a case manager (PCP). In that appointment they will be assigned to a specialty care group based on their needs."


**Finding #3 - Strategic and consistent marketing is important all the time - not just for large benefit expansions like PACT Act**

- Consistent communication across various mediums - Community news, social media, TV news, billboards, radio, etc. - is vital, and not just for big events like PACT Act
- Veterans get varying information from VA's marketing messages as well as what they hear through word-of-mouth and this causes confusion when they are seeking care

>  " We need more strategic marketing. They'll get their information from friends, family, and neighbors too. If we put reading materials out there, they can come in with accurate information instead of hearsay."

**Staff pain points**
- Making sure Veterans have all materials with them when registering can be tough; takes 30-45 minutes to complete over the phone
- Reaching the Veteran is difficult - communicating, collaborating with other departments, finding homeless Veterans, etc.

**Ideal State Notes**

> "It'd be great to have a listing of providers at each VA facility with their specialty and even with ratings. Having that knowledge of who is available and who isn’t would be ideal."
- RJ noted that the marketing communications from VA aren't always consistent and Veterans also rely on hearsay so they often come in with inaccurate information about how VA health benefits work and what they qualify for
