# 10-10EZ Toxic Exposure UX 

## Summary
- [Research folder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/research/2024-04-ToxicExposure-UsabilityStudy)
  
## April 2024 Research - Key findings:

1. Most Veterans have been or believe they have been exposed to toxic materials in the military, but they don't know if it qualifies as "toxic exposure."

2. Veterans would like more information about what time periods during their service are eligible to note any toxic exposure.

3. Veterans would like to see more branching logic in the toxic exposure questions based on what VA already knows about them or what they answered previously.

4. There is some confusion with how to identify exposure dates and why VA is asking for them.

5. We uncovered some usability issues that were missed since the TERA project timeline didn't allow for a full research study until post-launch.

## Recommendations

- We should revisit content updates commented in Figma since the release when executing on version 2 of TERA
- We should revisit the flow starting with the service dates and branching off using conditional logic
  - We can show how document upload can vary based on responses placing them into Cohort 1, 2, or 3

## Questions for stakeholders

### HEC
- Will HEC update the PDF version of the form to reflect the the updated Priority group 6 based on VHA request (week of 3/25)?
- The [priority group list](https://www.va.gov/health-care/eligibility/priority-groups/) includes "atmospheric testing" and "the occupation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki or Enewetak Atoll." - Should those be added to the cleanup and response efforts question?
- Can we further clarify what types of potential toxic exposure on the "Other toxic exposures" page would impact a Veteran's priority group and are truly worth a Veteran's time to report?
- Since we heard a lot of feedback about training, what kind of toxic exposures that may have occurred during training are worth a Veteran's time to report?
- What are your requirements for the digital form in terms of branching logic? Since we ask for service dates before the TERA questions, we could only asked applicable questions based on those dates. Could there be any edge cases or negative consequences to branching logic based on service dates?
- What efforts do you know of to target specific groups of Veterans who may be eligible, such as Veterans who were deployed during the Vietnam War?

**Documents**

- Can HEC access Veteran documents in eFolder if they've already uploaded them to VA.gov on other forms, like the 526 disability form?
- Can we have specific document upload pages based on the Veteran's cohort, which can be determined by TERA responses?

## Decisions made
