This folder will house documents related to adding Toxic Exposure questions/options to the EZ and EZR forms.

Initial note from Jessica Soza regarding the TERA and MOCK draft documents in the archive folder:
>Attached are the drafts for the 10-10EZ and the 10-10EZR, and a mock-up for reference of the 10-10EZ. The mock-up will be used to help the forms team understand how we want the new TERA questions to look on both forms.
> 
>At this time, only the TERA updates and increased burden time will be submitted to OMB, with a publishing goal of 2/1/24.
>The second round of edits will include the 10-10EZ reorganization (sections and questions) and coordination with VA.gov to mitigate all identified discrepancies. That draft will be submitted with our PRA renewal with a publishing goal of 06/2024.

Conversation regarding ways for us to make this addition easy for Veterans to navigate:
>screening for toxic exposure. they copied the section from the 526EZ application for disability benefits (see section IV)
>
>when i talked to them, i floated the idea of not including the question if the veteran already answered them in their 526 application>
>
>since the computers and the internets have the ability to look up info that we already have — whereas a paper form just sits there
