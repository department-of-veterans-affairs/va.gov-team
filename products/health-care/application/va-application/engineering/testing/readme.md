# Testing

## Test Coverage 

### Backend (vets-api)
`vets-api` uses the SimpleCov gem to determine test coverage. To find the most recent report, find the last successful `master` build of [vets-api here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/actions/workflows/code_checks.yml?query=branch%3Amaster) and click on the name of the branch. Under `Artifacts` at the bottom of that page there is a downloadable `Coverage Report` that shows the test coverage for all of `vets-api`. The `index.html` in the downloaded file will open the report. Filtering on `hca` and `health_care_application` should return all of the 10-10EZ `vets-api` code we are responsible for. 

### Front End (vets-website)
