### How to run locally

Follow the standard directions to run the app. The API needs to be running in order to run the app locally.

### VA Forms

We are using version 1 of the forms library, Formation. This is a straight forward standard form. We are using [the vets-json-scheam](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-json-schema) to validate the shape of the data.  

### What API(s) does this use?

The data ends up in the ESR (Enrollment).

### Feature toggles



### How to test new features?

Each feature should have unit tests and e2e tests. We can use the Review Instances to review before merging a PR.
Engage Joshua Faulkner/Enrollment System team for testing new features before going live.  Our staging is connected to the ES SQL environment.

### 10-10EZ Schema information

**States list for drop-downs**

The state list in the schema is supposed to be what the 10-10ez accepts
- Currently (as of 7/2022), the Enrollment System can only accept the 50 US States, Washington DC and 'Other'
     - "Washington DC" translates to state code "DC" in the backend
     - "Other" translates to state code "FG" in the backend to signify a foreign country, province or other location that is not the 50 US states & DC
- Any other values should be put in another schema. 
- The Enrollment system may have future work to expand the acceptance of other countries/provinces/regions, however this is not yet in place

### Useful acronyms, terms and/or tips

- Application registry - Updates to the application URL, breadcrumb titles, menu titles and other page attributes can be found within the `content-build` repo in a file called `registry.json`.
