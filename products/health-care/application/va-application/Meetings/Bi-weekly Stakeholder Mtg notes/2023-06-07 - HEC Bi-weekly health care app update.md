### 6/7/23 Notes
- Patrick shared deck on Reg Only and EZR
     - Level setting expectations and understandings between our team and HEC
     - REG Only
         - Confirmed with Josh Faulkner that all 10-10EZ forms submitted online are currently processed as an “Enrollment”
	- Service to process registration is forthcoming (designed for PACT exams)
              - Will need to work out timing with VES to launch when ES can receive our data
         - Current Short Form flow still ends up as “Enrollment” even though it is a “Registration” use case
         - Questions answered on the call
              - Jessie: #1 - References Paper form with bullets and ‘instructions’
                  - Action Items: Compare shorter info referenced on Paper form to Short Form flow
              - Melanie: Reiterated that we want to know and explain what services are provided with Registration, esp for someone who may be eligible to enroll

  

  - EZR
    - Demographic info can be edited online VA.gov (profile page)
    - Jennifer: Additional scenario for Copayment test
    - Jessie asked clarifying questions to understand how VA.gov works and how users can update information online today
         - Patrick provided demo of logged in user after presentation
         - Questions answered
              - What are the 2-3 most common reasons a Veteran fills 
out and submits a 10-10EZR?
                   - Travel
                   - Copayment test
                   - demographic (NoK, Emergency contact, etc)/insurance info update
              - If a Veteran submits a paper 10-10EZ with only certain 
fields completed, how is it processed?
                   - Business will process a 10-10EZR with only certain fields entered/completed.

**Q from Rebecca:**
- To follow up with Soza, Jessica MS's previous comments, if a Veteran called the VAMC Eligibility office & said "I've moved. I want to update my mailing/residential address, phone numbers, & NOK/E-Contact's information. How can I do that?" 
- They don't want to call the HEC phone number, don't want to come into the facility but want to know how to do it online.
- Are you saying that 100% of the fields of the form are currently or that they can be implemented on VA.gov?
- **ANSWER:**  That is the goal


**Q from Melanie Pantoja**
- are all changes made on va.gov linked to ES and updated live (24/48 hours or days/weeks...?)
- **ANSWER:**  That is the goal

**Q from Jessica Soza:**
- to be clear. . . . with this route . . .  we are requiring a person to have a VA.gov account to update their information . . . IF we don't have an online 10-10EZR?
- **ANSWER**: Yes, to update online.  They can still update in person, via phone, other non-digital channels today


**From Jennifer:**
- We were really looking for the form to be online like the EZ
- **Patrick** explained that we will create a wireflow to help illustrate the idea presented today
- Volume = 500k per year

**From Melanie:**
- Concern as a Veteran, can fill out EZ without signing in.
- Member services wants to have this same functionality online for EZR

**From Patrick**: 
- Concern that the Online EZR cannot be identify confirmed if not logged in
- Business Policy team still reviewing form comparison info, hope to share before the next meeting!
