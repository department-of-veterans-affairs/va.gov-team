# Sep 11, 2024 | 10-10EZ/EZR Modification Updates

## Notes
### Confirmation emails - prioritization with ES
* Requested prioritization of this change request
* VES-27327 Email Confirmation Shift from VES to VA Notify
* **Heather** sent Change Request number to HEC via TEAMs chat
* **Heather**: This requires integration between VES and VA Notify, and lays the foundation of other statuses that could be sent to Veterans
### Reg Only
* Demo Next Meeting!
* **Simone**: May have additions to the Registration Only, will get back to Heather on this
### Confirm drop of ACA checkbox from Facility selection page
* Checkbox no longer on the paper form since the latest updates (June/July 2024)
* Content for checkbox: "I'm enrolling to get minimum essential coverage under the Affordable Care Act"
* OK to remove the checkbox for now (from several folks on the call, including **Amanda S and Simone**)
* **Simone**: HEC wants the team to repurpose this to have an opt-in to receive the 1095-B electronically.
* **Jessica Stump**: [Figma page](https://www.figma.com/design/UljiHam46o5DItC5iDgmPd/10-10EZ?node-id=3529-98040&t=qntCrOyDj0OZkEFo-4) with ACA checkbox as it is today, maybe [the new purpose checkbox] belongs somewhere else on the form
* **Heather**: This will require changes from VES and VA.gov
* This is something to talk about but is not officially on the roadmap yet
* We agree to remove the ACA checkbox now, and look into the potential for adding a checkbox for the 1095-B opt-in
### EZR EC Address (not on paper form)
* **Hieu**: is it ok to ask for the EC address in the online form (optional)?
    * Already confirmed the system can accept this data
    * **Simone**: Yes, since the system can accept it.
### Request for Call Center data
* **Lois** sent 2 emails requesting call center data for deep dive into reasons that Veterans are calling in, to help with OKR tracking, OCTO leadership initiatives, and user experience
* **Amanda** responded via email (not sure if the right email address was used): HEC doesnâ€™t track call center data that way, to that degree of detail.
