This impacts billing on the back end to those who are or are not SC though. We can bill OHI for things unrelated to SC/SA

Is there a fix in place for that information that is provided on the online application and not transmitting to VES?

this is the page that determines the short form correct?


---

[2:16 PM] Faulkner, Joshua I.

POB and MMN are identity fields; all the rest of those do come over in the online submissions, signature date is not a separate field though


---

[2:17 PM] Matt Long (Guest)

Jennifer, that is correct.

These applications they are not

We have received multiple reports of information missing and the field is going in to add the information in VistA


---

[2:18 PM] Gully, Simone

This is a problem especially with transitioning service members which we get the most complaints from 

---

[2:18 PM] Faulkner, Joshua I.

oh, you mean the short form doesn't have it?

---

[2:19 PM] Faulkner, Joshua I.

it does, those questions are before the rating question

---

[2:19 PM] Gully, Simone

Yes the short form is problematic for receiving data and then the service members get upset when asked information and state the form didn't ask them that

---

[2:20 PM] Faulkner, Joshua I.

thats not true, it does ask them for those things

---

[2:21 PM] Gully, Simone

I will send you an ICN to show you information on the 1010 that is on the application in VES but no record of transmission and the fields were blank

---

[2:22 PM] Faulkner, Joshua I.

then it means they just didn't answer it; they are optional

[2:24 PM] Faulkner, Joshua I.

something to bring up though if you'd like those fields to be mandatory so they can't just skip over them

Does skipping the financials record as a non-disclosure?

Not collecting some info impacts other LOB's (ie race/ethnicity, EC/NOK ) as others need that to do outreach etc

Is it possible that even with the short form if they do not sign in with va.gov that will verify their SC they still have to answer the financial question

---

[2:31 PM] Faulkner, Joshua I.

no, it'll go in as a non disclosure in the long form if they explicitly say they choose not to provide it, with the short form it totally skips it

Can I be greedy and ask for an online 10ezr? 

---

[2:40 PM] Echols, Stacey

Yes

---

[2:40 PM] Thaxton, Neshelle

that would drive many more Veterans to do this online versus sites or mailing updates

Can we get some volumes on the Paper EZR?

common reasons/changes that are submitted with EZRs

---

[2:43 PM] Thaxton, Neshelle
