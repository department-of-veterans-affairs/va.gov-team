This folder will store all meeting notes from the PO/PM weekly sync.
- This is a meeting with PO, PMs, Design Lead to discuss strategy, future initiatives and ideas.  This allows for random discussions that will not distract the team as a whole.  This does not mean that the team cannot discuss ideas and random thoughts during the Bi-weekly PO sync, that is still a welcome discussion.
