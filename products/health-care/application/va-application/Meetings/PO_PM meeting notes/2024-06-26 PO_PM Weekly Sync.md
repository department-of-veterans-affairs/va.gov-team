### Notes
- CG Form Updates
     - Update provided to Patrick & Lois on testing attempt
     - Review Instance will be re-deployed and we will resume testing
- EZ Facilities API
     - Confirmed what we know now and what our new plan is going forward (align with VES facilities list cadence)
     - Heather explained that Josh F was asked about this and we knew that the Enrollment system gets an update once per month and that submission issues could happen, tho we made a bet that it would be low impact.
          - Heather acknowledged that this bet did not work out and a pivot on direction is needed
          - Also acknowledged this lesson learned for future CG facilities work

- EZR team is still working on
     V2 Flow Research Plan (had other priorities come up delaying this)
     Breadcrumbs and Secondary Nav–any update on this from the MHV side?
     Bug fixes, tweaks, tech and design debt, etc.
- Next up:
     TERA eligibility display dsicovery
     Notifications discovery
- EC/NOK
     Got word from Wes that their survey is seeing around a 10% request to edit EC/NOK
     We’ll keep this in mind, this will be part of V2 Flow but I’ll do a deeper dive with Wes
- Post mortems
     We’re finishing up OOB one
     We’re working on finishing up the Outage one and updating our SoP
     Hope to have both of those over for final review later this week
