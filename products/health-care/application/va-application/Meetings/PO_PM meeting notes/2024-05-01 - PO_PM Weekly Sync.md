### Notes

     - Technical perspective - Event Bus is ready for us to integrate
     - EB folks want to get Enrollment system in (they are working on this?)

- PG
     - PB: Not sure
          - Where is the right place?
          - How can the veteran use this information?
     - HJ: Would it cause more confusion?
     - PB: Veteran Awareness - Intended behavior to surface information that Veterans may not know (ex. Copays)
          - How often is someone’s PG changed - HJ to find conversation
          - How are veteran’s notified - letter in the mail
     - HJ to Check in with Profile team on any plans for PG on profile
     - Our team should own this - but where should it go?
     - Small discovery - find the value of this information (if there is any) - One of our teammates should become a SME on this
