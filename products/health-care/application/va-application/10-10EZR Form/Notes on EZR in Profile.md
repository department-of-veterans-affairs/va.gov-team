# Notes on EZR in Profile

Some thoughts on whether or not the EZR should be linked from the Profile.

## Background

In our research with Veterans on where they expect to update financial information on VA.gov, 11 out of 12 said they would want to update it in the VA.gov Profile. When the scope of the work expanded to the entire EZR form, not just financial information, we decided to explore adding a link to the EZR form from the Profile.

## Possibilities

**Create a menu item and link to the form**: [See the Sketch file for better context](https://sketch.com/s/da85cf44-4503-4e98-834e-ff068b242ef6).

Advantages:

- Puts the information where Veterans expect it, even if it's more than just financial information.

Disadvantages:

- It's difficult to label the menu item. You can't call it Financial information, which is what we tested in research, because the EZR work has expanded to include the whole form. It's more than just financial information. The menu items in the Profile are all very specific kinds of updates, not broad, like "Health care information."
- People go to the Profile and make updates directly there. This would be one of the few places where it would be more informational and the updates would not be made there in place.
- The Profile and its existing design patterns don't make for a good landing page/informational page.
- Veterans told us to

Recommendation: Don't put a link to the EZR in the Profile. Explore other, nearby areas (like My VA) that could have a similar impact. The [touchpoints ticket could help inform the work](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/63746).
