## EZR-related questions
### Overall
- We don’t fill out EZRs just to correct a phone number. Add a dependent, sure, but not a phone number.
- We don’t send letters for just updating demographics. If their priority group changes, then they’ll get a letter.
     - Business wondered aloud -  if it would be valuable to send out letters to tell them their priority group didn’t change…
     - HEC is involved with the current letter process
1. What type of information do Veterans consider most important to update and why? Do they ask?
     - Mainly they’re updating financial information to assess whether they have co-payments or not. Also update demographic information (addresses, phone numbers, health insurance information)
          - Mainly in-person or online, or on the phone with the call center. VAMC isn’t permitted to update financial info over the phone.
     - Registration staff can take phone number/address info over the phone but they have to verify it.
2. What are some major pain points for Veterans and staff as they go through the process?
    - Veterans are frustrated that there’s no automated system prompting them to update their financial information. They find out when they have started getting bills, desk staff says it needs to be updated, etc, for example. They sometimes call and want to give their financial information over the phone (with the VAMC), but they’re not permitted to update that with them. They have to call another 1-800 number to talk to HEC staff authorized to update financials.
    - Only eligibility staff are allowed to take information over the phone (they have recorded lines). Not sure why that rule can’t extend to other staff.
3. What does the staff see, what kind of change can help Veterans?
    - Anything that makes things more accessible or easier to update, especially financial information. Sometimes referrals for the next stage of care is delayed due to challenges with getting financial information for and/or from family members - especially when the family member is trying to provide/update information on behalf of the Veteran.  They don’t know how to navigate this process.
    - **H:** is this a common occurrence?
        - Yes, no one is thinking about financial information until someone is in the hospital and needs care. Someone is pretty ill and now this update needs to happen in real time.
    - **H:** Are there any other triggers for updating EZR?
        - Sometimes Veterans contact the VA to update their information. But Veterans aren’t saying “Hey, can I have a new EZR?” they’re telling someone at the desk that they have a new phone number.
    - **H:** Are there certain groups or priority groups that updates more often than others?
        - I can’t think of any trends based on priority group. All the Veterans who check-in to preregister for their appointment, they have to update their information then.
4. Are Priority Groups based on income/net worth?
5. What are the existing directives relating to this process?

### Use cases
1. What are some uncommon/ challenging cases of Veterans wanting to update their info? What is the most challenging for the staff to update?
    - Financial information is the most challenging, especially if the Veteran doesn’t know that income information offhand. We don’t want to put in incorrect information and have the Veteran receive an audit from the eligibility center.
2. When Veterans calls to update dependent only, is there a script that points the Veterans elsewhere?
    - No script. A Veteran calling in to update dependents only is not a common occurrence. 
### Processes
- Flags: Staff receives trigger notifications to ask Veterans. Do Veterans receive certain notifications to update their information? (Insurance/ financial disclosure)
- Flags: When staff receive the tiggers, do they do anything beyond the typical flow such as phone call? How do the Veterans know to update?
- What happens after the Veterans update? Is there a phone call/email/letters?
- If the Veterans only want to update one section (Address), how do the staff proceed?
- What happens when the Veterans submit an incomplete EZR?
- When updating, why does the staff only use one system vs another (VistA/ES)? Is this part of the training?
- Who has access to change certain sections? MSA? Financial vs next of kin?
### Updates/frequency
1. Are there certain demographic/ Priority Groups that update their information more than others? 
2. Do certain Priority Groups have to complete an EZR every year?
3. What methods or channels do veterans prefer for updating their information?
4. How do veterans perceive the security and privacy aspect of updating their information?
5. What types of assistance or support do Veterans require when updating their information?
## Registration-only related questions
### Overall process
1. Describe your "registration" process.
    - A Veteran is never going to come in and say “hey, I need to register for care” rather than enroll. That’s not language that’s valuable to the Veteran. They say they want to get healthcare. They tell us their story, we get all their information, and then we know whether they’re eligible to enroll. For example, an 8E (priority group)  would not be eligible. Veterans don’t know or care about the difference.
    - There’s 8 priority groups and priority 8 has subgroups. An 8E has 0% disability with a service connection. They can be treated for that service-connection only. They would be registered, but not enrolled.
    - **DK:** When this Veteran gets registered, do you explain this to the Veteran?
        - Absolutely. They would still get a PCP, and let’s be honest. They’ll check in on that specific condition (they can’t be referred to another area for something unrelated). But they’ll probably still do a full physical/analysis of symptoms. They just can’t receive care for anything else.
2. After you register a Veteran, what do you and/or what does the Veteran need to do next? (what are the next steps? Welcome packet example)
    - When someone is enrolled (vs. registered), they’re put on a “Nears(?)” list to be seen by a primary care provider. The Veteran is asked if they want primary care.
    - If the Veteran was only registered, they would be contacted by eligibility to explain the scope of their benefits. 
3. What tasks are completed,  data gathered during a "registration only" pathway?
    - We gather pretty much all the information except for financial information or military information. If Veterans want to register for just a health exam (say, for a Gulf War registry), that would be registration only.
    - Done a bunch of registration only for spouses and dependents.
4. How has the directive/regulations impacted your workflow when processing health care applications?
5. **A:** Do most Veterans know what their priority group is/understand?
    - Most know. Sometimes they won’t dig into the nuances until it’s relevant. For example, when the Veteran needs dental care, they find out they don’t have access to that benefit. The confusion is more often from the family; the Veterans have a good handle on it. It’s when the family is trying to coordinate care that they may get blindsided by the limitations of the priority group.
### Registration meaning/awareness

1. What does "Registration" mean to you when signing up Veterans for health care benefits?
    - It’s one of the pathways for getting someone’s needs met.
    - Is it the most appropriate way to get them the care they are entitled 
2. Is there anything that displays to the staff indicating that the Veteran is Registered or Enrolled, when they call/visit the facility?
    - We’re able to see that. If they’re not in a priority group, they’re not enrolled. If they’re in 8E or 8G, they’re not enrolled.
    - **DK:** Is that something you all know? Part of your job?
        - Yes, it’s our job to know that. Eligibility gets real weird real fast. We’ve developed cheat sheets, demographics sheets. The nuances of eligibility is a hot mess. They were locally developed and became extremely helpful during COVID to help facilitate the influx of people needing vaccination.
        - Mental health is also an area where things get weird real fast, due to multiple executive orders and other complexities.
### Eligibility / guiding Veteran
1. How do you provide guidance to Veterans when they are not sure if they should register or enroll?
    - Most Veterans don’t know there’s a difference between reg. And enrolled and they probably don’t care. If the Veteran is looking to get insurance through ACA through their state exchange, they’re told they have to disenroll from VA care in order to get insurance for their spouses and dependents. In some states, the state exchange requires this for the family to have access. The VA insurance is considered insurance for their whole family even though the family doesn’t have access to benefits.
    - This scenario occurs often enough that it seems real. One of the state exchanges with this problem might be Pennsylvania, check with Ohio and West Virginia too.
2. How do you help Veterans navigate to the most health care benefits applicable to them when they call in to enroll/register?
    - When they enroll and they’re in an enrollment group, they receive a benefits book. The staff is well-versed in the service-connected process. They’re connected with VSOs to help them possibly get a higher rating and give them other forms of support. Our job is to get them in the door and get them started on their relationship with us, but we aren’t case managers.
    - The Primary Care team is also good at following up with Veterans and letting them know what their options are, what benefits they have access to. The information they share with Veterans is very detailed.
### Terminology
1. Could you explain to me the health care application process and benefit options as if I were a Veteran?
2. Has a Veteran ever called and directly asked to be "registered" only? Do they mean changing VA Facilities?
3. Do you use the term "register" with the Veteran or is it "decline enrollment"?
### Perfect state
1. What’s one thing you’d change in the overall registration/application process if you had a magic wand?
    - I would like it to be easier for Veterans and family members to access…the financial updates, when they need families to do that. I explored using DocuSign so we could send the packet to a next-of-kin instead of using paper and sending things back and forth. But we don’t have the authority to accept electronic signatures. That feels arbitrary to me. 
    - Make it easier for Veterans to access the care. Even if we could do enrollment over the phone, possibly send the paperwork to them to get the signature later, they could then access care that day. This is the biggest blocker for us.
    - The mechanism exists for them to do that with HEC, but from the Veteran’s perspective: I’m already on the phone with this person. I like them, I trust them, and I don’t want to call someone else. Now I have to call someone else and go through a separate wait system.
2. What are the largest pain points for Veterans that you see from your perspective in this process?
    - From our older cohort, getting verification from their military service, if they don’t have their discharge papers and they’re from an era when that information wasn’t digitized, it can be a big blocker for them. They have to contact the archives and get that information from them. It can take months of waiting to hear back.
    - **DK:** Any other cohorts have pain points?
        - That’s the biggest pain points. But functional literacy also varies dramatically. Some folks get online and they’re overwhelmed by it. We tell those folks to gather their paperwork, come into the hospital, and we’ll go through it with them line-by-line. They’re intimidated by the length, or the importance. Paperwork in general can be intimidating, especially government paperwork that has your signature on it. 
3. If you have to tag as Registered and/or Enrolled, what is the current process and the ideal state?
    - The system does it automatically. This plus this equals this. There are a handful of circumstances where the system isn’t going to calculate that correctly. The staff will tag things with a “HEC alert” that lets people know the record needs to be manually changed. This happens a handful of times every week. It’s not technically difficult to do, but sometimes it takes time, like a week or so, to get a response back on an alert.
### Use Cases
1. How often do you have to help Veterans who are / were "registered" to then "enroll"?
    - Sure, that comes into play a lot. Some Veterans come into the system over income and have a 0% service connection, and once they retire or lose a job, they’ll come back and update their information. Or maybe they get a new award for service-connection, now they’re eligible for benefits. It’s not usually the Veteran electing not to enroll and changing their mind, it’s more they’re now eligible.
2. How do you communicate how community care benefits differ between Register and Enrolled?
    - Don’t know how often that comes up, but that’s related to eligibility. It can get complicated, especially with mental health care. I don’t think we have a script or anything.
    - The PCPs are the point person with this. This would be communicated when the Veteran is talking to their PCP. This isn’t something we’d get in the middle of.
    - That’s information they should get from CHAMPVA. Sometimes we’ll get involved with it in special cases; it’s case-by-case. It’s not a conversation we’d be initiating during registration.
3. How often is the reason for registration only to be seen only for service connected disability care?
    - Hard to answer without doing a data pull on who our 8E’s are, but that’s the most obvious place a Veteran would be with service-connection only care.
4. How often is the reason for registration only to be seen for a C&P exam?
    - Need to run a data report on that. We get requests for it, though not so often for C&P. Those are now contracted out, we don’t do those in-house. For environmental registry exams and enrollments in research projects or our HUD VASH (homelessness) program.


### Synthesis
- Veterans mainly EZR forms to update financial information and sections that require wet signatures (dependent).
- Veterans only get notified if their Priority Group changed. Staff thinks it is also valuable to notify Veterans when their Priority Group did not change.
- VAMC staff will update demographic information with the veterans without going through EZR form.
- Veterans prefer to work with the VAMC staff to update their information instead of being referred/redirected to eligibility staff for updating financial information, “Why can’t I work with you?”. 
- All Veterans go through check-in to pre-register for their appointments; they would have to update their information then.
- The next stage of care is delayed due to getting financial information from the family/caretaker as they don’t know how to navigate the process.
