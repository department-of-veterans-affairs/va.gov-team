## 6/13/23 Martinsburg - Initial Chat with Shawn Lawson

- Patrick - opening explanation of EZR form
     - We want to know why Veterans are being told to complete EZR and how it is handled by staff

- Shawn - Veteran previously seen and needs to provide updates will fill out an EZR
     - Patrick - what would trigger financial info?
     - Shawn - Depends if financial situation has changed.  Once changed, it should be updated (usually done when a Veteran qualifies for more financial aid).  Hardly ever see it the other way

- Shawn - HEC removed the need to provide means test annually (WHAT IS THIS ABOUT)
     - IVM cross matching - Veteran states their income $X but IVM checks that Veteran has higher income, Veteran is converted back to lower priority group
     - HEC notifies Veteran and requests verification of income - EZR will be completed to provide update/repeal/rebut the findings

- Common updates - Spouse/Dependency changes, financials, demographics
     - Painpoints - no answer - we address everything that comes in the door, update the ES, scan the doc to HEC, no complaints received except that it is a paper process
     - In ER, staff member will work with AODs, stressful in ER of course
     - Office visit - desk staff works with Veteran and requests them to complete and obtain signature, wet signature may not be required any longer
     - There is a space on the form for signature
     - AOD staff will sign on behalf (in lieu of) when the Veteran is incapacitated
     - We are capable of assist the Veteran as well

- How to improve
     - Will bring folks in to answer this question
     - **Patrick** - we will take you up on that

- Challenges to make updates/complete form
     - No issues

- Volume - Not too frequent anymore since Covid and omission of means test 

- If chng of address is done at desk, it is done in ES right there (no form)
     - Try to insist local outpatient clinic update demographic data there, why send a Veteran to another part of the hospital to change their address
     - Wish would re-implement verification of address (not our thing, but a nice note)
          - Both This is a real address and the Veteran lives here
