# Attach Supporting Evidence Documentation Initiative
#### Overview

<details>
 
 *There is roughly a 1:many relationship between products and initiatives, or our attempts to improve a product/achieve Veteran outcomes. The same goes for product outlines and initiative briefs. This template can be used as product documentation for the Collaboration Cycle, especially when iterating an existing product. In addition, the Brief is an important communication tool within a team and between the team and Crew Chief/PO/other teams.*

## Outcome Summary
> *Brief statement describing opportunity you're pursuing e.g. "Increase Use of Search Tools on VA.gov." Include measurable outcome (i.e. metric) you're trying to affect.*
* Allow Veterans to attach supporting documentation to their EZR, particularly documentation concerning Toxic Exposure. There are a borad array of documents the VA would like from Veterans for Toxic Exposure claims which may or may not be a part of their particular record. These documents should help imrpove the speed and effectiveness of Toxic Exposure claims.

## Problem
> *Describe the challenge / pain point you seek to address.:* 
* What is the problem and who is affected? And, what evidence do we have of the problem?
* Why do you think the problem is occurring? Other reasons why this might be occurring?
* How does this initiative help further OCTO-DE's mission and goals?

In order to faster and more effectively adjudicate Veterans' Toxic Exposure claims, HEC/Member Services sometimes use documents provided by Veterans to help establish the locations and timeframes where a Veterans was exposed to toxins. At times these documents are things not otherwise found in a Veteran's official Military record, such as orders or testimonials. The VA has made it a priority to have as many Veterans as possible submit Toxic Exposure information if the Veterans believes they were exposed to toxcins while serving.

## Discovery
### Assumptions/Risks
> *Identify risks related to usability, value to users, feasibility/implementation, and viability given organizational constraints<sup>2</sup>. 
> Indicate how you'll validate/test against these risks. Inspired by [SVPG's Four Big Risks](https://www.svpg.com/four-big-risks/).*

- **Value Risks** (will people use it): 
  - The 10-10EZ saw ~2% of applications have documents attached prior to launching the TERA questions on March 5, 2024, will the EZR see a similar low usage?
  - Will HEC/MS be able to use any of the deocuments Veterans upload?
  
- **Usability Risks** (can people figure out how to use it):
  - Will Veterans understand that they can upload documents to be added their VHA record?
  - Will Veterans understand that they can only upload certain support document types, and will they be able to make sure their documentation is in that file type (PDF, PNG, RTF)?
  - Will Veterans understand the types of documents the VA are seeking for TERA claims?
  - Will Veterans understand that (in theory) they do not need to upload official Military documents that VA has access to (e.g. DD214)? And will Veterans spend their time uploading documents that aren't necessary? 
 
- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data):
  - Examples:
    - Upstream/Downstream API/Data availability and reliability
    - Site performance impacts (see [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse), [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/), #-daily-lighthouse-scan)
  
- Will the VA Enrollment System (VES) be able to receive and process accordingly the attached documentation?
- 

- **Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact):
  - Examples: 
    - VA stakeholder testing, marketing, compliance requirements
