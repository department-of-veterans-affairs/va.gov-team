> I'm trying to get on the right page regarding a 10-10EZ "registration only" workflow on VA.gov.
> 
> I know this has been something that has been talked about for a long time, but we've never been able to actually understand what problem VA is trying to solve with a registration only workflow. The attached requirements document references the toxic exposure registry (see "Scope Details" section), but we heard from the VHA Health Outcomes for Military Exposures (HOME) team that runs the registry that it was no longer needed. More recently, there was a discussion about enabling active duty service members to register before transition. VA.gov and VES already provide this functionality when a user enters a future discharge date on the VA.gov 10-10EZ. And just today I heard something about auto-registering Veterans who are applying for disability compensation (which, if correct, would not implicate VA.gov in my mind).

> Registration is needed for Veterans requesting an eligibility assessment, clinical evaluation, care or treatment pursuant to a special treatment authority provided in 38 C.F.R. 17.37, (care and services noted below).
>
> However, the real solution to the problem isn’t registration only pathways in my opinion it is auto registration. If we know who you are you should already be registered, this step should not exist. Our first step in that effort was the change that is going in tomorrow, the auto registration for service-connected disability adjudication. This change was part of the OneVA initiative started last year, in collaboration with Member Services, VES, and OCTO, however priorities changed and this was bumped further down in releases, resulting in a release tomorrow opposed to back in the fall, as initially envisioned.
>
> The long term goal is and was auto registration. Some ideas have ranged from upon separation or registering all service members at accession (when they initially sign up for service) via an integration with the DoD or using an existing service. The long term goal of auto registration is not yet determined and so we need to ensure we are able to continue serving the need of the Veterans access to these services as well as providing a self service pathway. In addition, even after we can get to auto registration there may still be a need for this channel, but that is not clear yet.

> For the self-service registration pathway, my inclination is to integrate registration into the “thing” the Veteran is trying to obtain. For example, a Veteran seeking mental health care under 17.37 would be registered (ideally automatically, with little to no action needed from the Veteran) as part of the mental health appointment request process on VA.gov. 
>
> This concept would work for most of the 17.37 use cases. However, I think for a 50% or greater rated Veteran with seeking comprehensive care, the point at which we’d offer registration-only would be in the existing VA.gov EZ flow. We would need some very clear guidance on the benefits of choosing registration vs. enrollment in this instance so we can sufficiently inform the Veteran when presenting the choice.

>  
> Thanks, Amanda. Here are my thoughts and questions on the use cases you shared. I tried to categorize to make things easier. Please let us know if you want to dig deeper into any of these.
> 
> Possible self-service use case / needs more discovery
> 
> - C&P Disability Benefits Exam: I'd strongly recommend this be addressed through auto-registration (and maybe it already is). If a Veteran submits a disability compensation application (526) and are auto-registered in VES, then this category should already be taken care of.
> - [50%+] Service-Connected Only: As stated earlier in the thread, this one might be the most appropriate for a self-service registration only pathway as part of the 10-10EZ. However, we would need to clearly articulate to the Veteran why they should choose to register instead of enroll.
> - Active Duty: Does VHA serve a lot of active duty service members? How does this interact with their DHA care? I could see a possible VA.gov self-service pathway if we do serve a lot of active duty service members.
> - Clinical Evaluation: How does VHA "advertise" and then schedule a clinical evaluation for Veterans not already registered/enrolled? Put another way, and to Josh's point, how would a Veteran know they should request a clinical evaluation?
> - Immunizations: If this is a large population, could be appropriate for self-service registration, but would make that registration part of the scheduling of the immunization (ideally auto-registration when the immunization appointment is made).
> - HUD-VASH: How do HUD-VASH beneficiaries currently get registered for care? This could be another opportunity for auto-registration, as opposed to requiring the beneficiary to self-serve.
> - Beneficiary: My understanding is the primary program for dependent care is CHAMPVA, which has its own application and registration process. Would this just be for CHAMPVA beneficiaries who are using their benefits at a VHA facility (and thus would need to be registered)?
> - Marriage/Family Counseling: Similar to immunizations, could potentially use self-service if this is a widely used service. Ideally would be part of the scheduling process and use auto-registration.
> - Other Than Honorable: Is there an existing or expected VA effort to provide care to OTH Veterans? If so, then possible that self-service registration could be part of that effort. Again, though, auto-registration as part of a larger OTH process would make sense.
> - Research: What is the existing process for registering non-patient research participants? Is this a large population?
> - Collateral (Other): What authority would persons in this group be receiving care? For instance, I know we registered lots patients as collaterals under the SAVE Lives Act (covid vaccinations for Veteran family members). But is there a broader / evergreen authority for which we would want to offer registration to non-Veteran collaterals?
> 
> Do not appear to be good candidates for self-service registration
> - 4th Mission: By its nature, this would be situation dependent and would not be a self-service experience we would want to continually offer on VA.gov
> - ART/IVF: I would imagine this is very small number of patients and that registration is managed/facilitated by the clinical team providing the care.
> - Employee: VA.gov is intended as Veteran-facing platform, not internal. If we need a place for employees to register for care, I think we'd be talking about a different (and internal-facing) interface.
> - Exposure Registry Exam: This one was covered in my initial email on the thread, but our understanding is that there is no longer a need here per the VHA HOME team.
> - Humanitarian/Emergency Room: This does not appear appropriate for a self-service pathway. Either the potential registrant is in need of immediate care and not in a state to use a self-service tool on VA.gov; or a case-by-case decision needs to be made by the facility chain of command to provide non-emergency humanitarian care.
> - Legislative Mandate: Also situational and not likely appropriate for self-service.
> - Newborn: I would imagine there are already functioning processes in place to register a child born at a VA facility so they can receive care postpartum.
> - Other: Appears situational and not appropriate for self-service.

> I agree the reason someone would register only is very limited, however we have Veterans that do not want to enroll due to ACA or they feel enrollment is for other Veterans that have more medical issues, or they only want to be seen by the VA for SC and nothing else. There could be other reasons that we are not aware of yet that could require Reg Only option in the future.
>
> The option to Reg Online is not available at this time. They can enroll online by providing a Future Discharge Date but if they attempt to do this online they are agreeing to be enrolled once the discharge date has passed, as the option to Register Only is not on VA.gov.

> - Active Duty: Does VHA serve a lot of active duty service members? How does this interact with their DHA care? I could see a possible VA.gov self-service pathway if we do serve a lot of active duty service members. **We are encouraging Transitioning Service Members to enroll within 365 days of separation. There is a bill where they want to push auto Registration for all Transitioning Service Members. The initial thought was to have them complete the registration online during TAP but we would like to recommend auto registration through the DOD and VES systems where manual intervention is not needed. This would make the Veteran known to VES and help with outreach to the Transitioning Service Members and possibly help with enrollment if the Veteran opts to enroll and all the information flows from DOD to VES.**

> Thanks, Amanda. I'm somewhat familiar with the ACA issue, but would welcome more details if you have them. My general understanding is that enrollment in the full benefits package potentially eliminates a Veteran's access to ACA marketplace plans; the way around this for Veterans seeking VA care with a 50%+ rating or care only for a SC condition is to un-enroll them and instead register only. So potentially just registering (and not enrolling) from the start would be an improvement. Is that roughly right?
>
> Bigger picture, this is starting to feel like a set of pre-application screening questions to guide the user to the right selection (enrollment or registration), supported with content that distinguishes between enrollment and registration on the main health benefits resource page. If your team could give us a rough idea of what the key questions are we'd want to use to screen for enrollment vs. registration, that would be sufficient to get us started with some mock ups.
