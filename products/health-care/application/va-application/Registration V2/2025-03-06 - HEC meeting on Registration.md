## Notes 
- Reasons for Registration (limited to these) - provided by Simone 
     - Registry exam
     - Clinical eval
- When working with HOME and registry exam questions (Veteran logs in and does this)
     - Will create a reg only record with reason
     - So then appointments can be set
     - Currently no process is in place, so questionnaires are sitting there but no appointment can yet be made because they aren’t registered
     - Process should be: Sign-in, Questionnaire goes to HOME thing, and should go to auto-create reg record, then can schedule an appointment
     - Would alleviate phone registrations
- Shawn - Generic API - min fields to create a record
     - This needs to be tied to the HOME questionnaire
     - Dr Pamela Hastings to help with HOME team contacts
- Does this even involve EZ??

### Summary from Heather Justice
**TL;DR** - Registration meeting is recorded. Angela Fulton understands what we want to do and will help communicate to Simone. Heather will work with Shawn to meet up with HOME team to discuss auto-registration process for registry exams (taking EZ out of it).
- So the HEC call went OK but I will say Simone was focused on the registry exam and getting those veterans in the system so they can make a registry exam appointment.  I did mention that VA.gov is not interested in this because there is no benefit to the Veteran, but what we are thinking about is registering before ANY appointment.  I don't think Simone was buying it (the meeting was recorded). Simone also mentioned that there is the Registry questionnaire that Veterans are filling out and the whole point of having Registration online was so that the questionnaire would trigger a registration pathway to VES.  This was news to me.  Shawn Edwards from VES registration project was there and helped talk thru that and he & I will see if there is an automation that can be done there to get the questionnaire info to feed into the VES API to create a registration record.  (This will then prompted the HEC staff to call the Veteran and make a Registry exam appointment)
     - This seems to alleviate the EZ form from needing to create something.  More to come
- I did also just have a lovely chat with Angela Fulton and she is 100% on the same page as us on having Reg be part of appointments and would love it if we could get it to where HEC staff did not have to call Veterans to register and make appointments.  She also has some wish list items that coincide with some of the same things our teams have on our priority list, such as providing status updates to Veterans when an EZ is pending due to needing financials, and providing a welcome email/text when Veteran is enrolled - all to reduce "Welcome" and "Pending" outbound calls from HEC staff
