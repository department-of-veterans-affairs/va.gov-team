## Slack & Email Alert: "Recovered: 1010EZ controller error rate is above 5%"

- Errors being captured are now below 5% of total submissions over the last 4 hours

### Required access

- [OCTO Datadog instance](https://vagov.ddog-gov.com/), read-only access
- [DSVA Slack](dsva.slack.com)
  - #1010-health-apps channel
  - #health-tools-1010-apm channel
  - #vfs-platform-support channel
- SOCKS access to review [Sentry logs](http://sentry.vfs.va.gov/organizations/vsp/issues/)

### Steps

- No Action needed, this alert is letting us know that the error rate is back to normal

## Slack & Email Alert: "1010EZ Silent Failure on sending submission failure email [VA Notify callback]"

- A 10-10EZ Form submission has failed submission, and the email that is sent to the Veteran has failed sending through VANotify.
- We should have already seen a `1010EZ submission job has failed with no retries left` failure, and then this monitor would trigger roughly 24 hours later if the email also fails (The email send operation is in a sidekiq job that has 14 retries).

### Required access

- [OCTO Datadog instance](https://vagov.ddog-gov.com/), read-only access
- [DSVA Slack](dsva.slack.com)
  - #1010-health-apps channel
  - #health-tools-1010-apm channel
  - #vfs-platform-support channel
- SOCKS access to review [Sentry logs](http://sentry.vfs.va.gov/organizations/vsp/issues/)

### Steps

- There should be a corresponding rails log named `Error notification to user failed to deliver` and with metadata containing the notification_id and form id (`{ notification_record_id: notification_record.id, form_number: metadata['form_number'] }`). The form id is `10-10EZ`.
- Query the database with `VANotify::Notification.find_by(notification_id: notification_id)` to find the failed notification record. The `to` attribute will be the Veteran's email address that we attempted to send the email message to. This email should correspond to a Personal Information Log from roughly 24 hours prior that is created when a 10-10EZ Form fails submission. Use this log to:
  - Obtain Veteran contact information (Name, Phone number)
  - Send the Veteran contact information via secure, encrypted email (from va.gov email address) to VHAHECEEDAdministrators@va.gov
  - Explain what has happened (submission failure) and provide the Veteran contact info.
  - Copy PO (Patrick Bateman) and PMs (Alex Seelig and Heather Justice - VA emails only)
