- By working with chemicals, pesticides, lead, asbestos, certain paints, nuclear weapons, x-rays, or other toxins during training or active duty service

[p] Next we'll ask about your household financial information from 2022. We’ll ask about income and expenses for you, your spouse (if you’re married), and any dependents you may have.

[h3] How we use your household financial information  

[p] It’s your choice whether you want to share your financial information. Before you decide, here’s what to know about how we’ll use your financial information. 

[p]{bold}   We use your financial information to determine these factors: 

[ul]
**If you’re eligible for VA health care based on your income.** You may be eligible based on factors other than your income. We call these “enhanced eligibility status” factors. If you don’t have one of these factors, we’ll use your income to decide if you’re eligible. 
**If you’re eligible for travel pay reimbursement.** Reimbursement means we pay you back for the cost of travel to and from your VA health appointments. 
**If you’ll need to pay a copay for non-service-connected care or prescription medicines.** This means you may need to pay a fixed amount for some types of care or medications you receive from a VA health care provider or an approved community care provider.

[/end ul]

[p] We ask for this information for billing purposes only. Your health insurance coverage doesn’t affect the VA health care benefits you can get.

Your private insurance provider may apply your VA health care charges toward your annual deductible. Your annual deductible is the amount of money you pay toward your care each year before your insurance starts to pay for care.
