# 2024-05-13 Find-a-form returning 404 for 10-10EZ after redirect

Fill out every section of this document, if there is no content for a particular section, explicitly call out that there is no content.

## Summary

The redirect from the old 1010ez application URL is not working with URLs adding any of the child pages in the path.  It's only matching /health-care/apply/application and /health-care/apply/application/, not anything under the path such as /health-care/apply/application/introduction. 

## Impact

 The link to the 1010ez from Find a Form (and potentially other places) is giving a 404 error.

- How many users were affected?
     - Potentially 800-1000 users could have been affected by this issue
          - Averageing the number of Find-a-Form searches from the previous month, about 116 users could have been affected by the error
          - The term "1010EZ" came up in 393 searches on VA.gov
          - The term "10-10ez" came up in 172 searches on VA.gov
          - The term "10-10EZ" came up in 293 searches on VA.gov
- What time period were users impacted?
     - 05/06/2024 11:20am ET to 05/13/2024 2:20pm ET
- What impact did this have on the SLO?

## Root Cause Analysis

Working from find a form, Adrian Rollett noticed that the link was to https://www.va.gov/health-care/apply/application/introduction and gave a `404` error.  At first, it was suspected to be a misconfigured react route, but while looking at that config realized that the base path had been moved.
Adrian then started looking at the revproxy redirects, and found that the redirect to the new URL only matched /health-care/apply/application or /health-care/apply/application/ and not any sub-paths
The change made in [PR #14258](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/devops/pull/14258) a couple weeks ago changed the redirect so it would match /health-care/apply/application as well as /health-care/apply/application/, but unfortunately stopped it matching paths beneath /health-care/apply/application/.

### What happened?

The 10-10EZ URL was changed from /health-care/apply/application/ to /health-care/apply-for-health-care-form-10-10ez/.  The [redirect request](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/80756) was submitted on 4/15/2024. 
The 10-10 team coordinated with IA to implement the redirect. On 5/2/2024, Matt Long (10-10 team engineer) commented in the Redirect request ticket that there was one redirect that was not working in the Review Instance we were testing in.  The finding was that if you search for "10ez" on VA.gov, the returned results on the 2nd option would be a `404`.  The issue was reviewed with Fran Cross and Jill Adams on Public Websites team.  On 5/3/2024, this is where Jill Adams mentions that "If this were a standard redirect, usually that would mean we're missing some regex that handles child paths. I think your PR should already be handling that".  Jill then refers to other engineers on the Public Websites team to take a look.  One of the engineers, Randi Mays, commented on 5/6/2024 that this looked to be common to the Review Instance behavior and happens with other URLs.
Matt Long merged the code on 5/6/2024.  Once the code was merged, the search steps were duplicated and produced a successful redirect, giving an assumption that there was no issue and that the Review Instance behavior was isolated.

On 5/14/2024, We got a couple of almost simultaneous reports that the healthcare application link from Choose VA was broken and the 1010EZ link from find a form was broken.  

### Why did it happen?

- Which mitigations were in place that should have prevented this, but failed to prevent it? How and why did these mitigations fail?
     - Testing in the Review Instance uncovered the issue, of a redirect not working from the Search function and selecting the 2nd option on the page, prior to deploying to Staging and Production. The issue was discussed and reviewed by multiple people on teams that are responsible for the redirect and search page successful functions.  The advisement was that this issue was that this was "Review instance behavior", having seen it on other URLs with similar child page setup.
- What should ordinarily have been done to prevent this, but wasn't done?
     - There does not seem to be any action that was not done that could have prevented this issue.  The testing was performed by several people in multiple environments, the impacted teams were engaged appropriately.  The redirect was reported as working as expected upon deployment to staging and production and there were no other indicators that an issue existed until 5/13/2024 when Adrian Rollett brought it to the 10-10 team's attention.
- What could have been done to prevent this, but isn't part of our modus operandi right now.
     - 10-10 team could have gone further to ask about the potential of a regex issue, as mentioned by Jill Adams.  The team could have also opened a Platform ticket to validate the Review Instance behavior.

### What will we change to ensure this doesn't happen again?

- The 10-10 team collaborated with the Public Websites team to update the current guidance ([DevOps README file](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/devops/blob/master/ansible/deployment/config/revproxy-vagov/vars/README.md)) on implementing URL redirects.  This update includes adding a reference on how to handle child pages and how to handle URLs with & without trailing slash.
- After the ReadMe file was updated, the [update was posted](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C5HP4GN3F/p1716211171892929) in the #vfs-frontend Slack channel.
- CAIA IAs will always vet the redirect request and ensure there is reference to child pages or casing variations when applicable. This is already part of the CAIA redirect request ticket template. They will also ensure that pages are being redirected to appropriate places and URLs are accurate.
- Process enhancements the CAIA team will be working on:
     - Modified process to reference shift of responsibility off PW team and onto requesting team with emphasis of IA approval and validation, and PW PR review
     - Updates to links across the modernized experience to ensure our links are accurate - this includes identifying links within React pages, core drupal pages, and facility pages - process details are TBD
     - Communications process to digital media partners and business line stakeholders informing them of the change and requesting they update the links within their TeamSite pages
     - Refined acceptance criteria and process documentation
     - Communication of the redirect process

## Resolution

Update was needed to change the redirect (from /health-care/apply/application/ to /health-care/apply-for-health-care-form-10-10ez/) to match all child pages under /health-care/apply/application/.

### What went well

The regex issue was easily found and remedied quickly, due to the expertise and experience of the Platform team, specifically Adrian Rollett

### What went wrong

N/A

### Where we got lucky
