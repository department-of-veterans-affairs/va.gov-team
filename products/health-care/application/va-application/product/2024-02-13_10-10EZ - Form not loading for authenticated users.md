# 2024-02-13 - 10-10EZ - Form not loading for authenticated users

Fill out every section of this document, if there is no content for a particular section, explicitly call out that there is no content.

## Summary

After the daily deploy on 02/12/2024, the 10-10EZ application lost the ability for authenticated users to access the application. Only the heading and "Need Info" sections are displayed on the screen.  Content was not rendering between the 2 sections. The [PR #27808](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/pull/27808) was determined to be the source of the issue, and has since been reverted.

## Root Cause Analysis

**PENDING** 
This section provides a detailed analysis of the event and provides this analysis from a systemic vantage point. Post-mortems are not intended as a "self-criticism" event, but rather as an opportunity to document, learn and improve. This section focuses on providing that input into the learning and adaptation process.

### What happened?

**PENDING** 
Describe in detail what actually happened and what the downstream effect of the event was outside of the information provided in the "Impact" section. Provide insight into the dependencies between the different moving parts of the problem-space. Start from earliest known trigger and work your way through the cascading events.

### Why did it happen?
**PENDING** 
- Which mitigations were in place that should have prevented this, but failed to prevent it? How and why did these mitigations fail?
- What should ordinarily have been done to prevent this, but wasn't done?
- What could have been done to prevent this, but isn't part of our modus operandi right now.

### What will we change to ensure this doesn't happen again?

**PENDING**  
Provide recommendations and concrete plans of action of how you will provide a systemic defense against this type of issue happening again in the future, including how will you ensure these recommendations are implemented & measured? How will you know if these new activities fail(ed)? In most cases, steps listed here should have corresponding action items.

## Resolution

**PENDING**  
Which steps were taken to resolve the incident. Include the link to the #oncall channel for conversation if a thread in #oncall exists.

### What went well

**PENDING**  
What went better than expected and deserves a call-out? Think more broadly than just "we got a fix out quickly", instead think about "what were the _enablers_ for X, Y going well".

### What went wrong

**PENDING**
The issue experienced in production did not appear in any other environments.  All tests (automated and manual) were completed successfully.  There was no indication that an issue would be introduced into production.

### Where we got lucky

**PENDING**  
Describe cases where, ordinarily, you would have expected to or could have encountered a roadblock, or a hurdle in getting to the resolution, but this _accidentally_ didn't happen (i.e. we got _lucky_). Do not include items that are part of standard operating procedure. In other words, describe instances where the process failed successfully. You can also use this to describe where safeguards did kick in, provided those safeguards prevented much worse from precipitating.

## Event Timeline

Include the step that describes when and how the issue was identified (i.e. how you detected that the issue existed).

- `2024-02-14 @ 09:36 AM ET`: Patrick Bateman posted to the Identity team requesting whether anything went out in website, vets-api, or elsewhere on monday afternoon that touched how va.gov handles users in general and/or LOA3 users specifically?

- `2024-02-14 @ 01:02 PM ET`: Matt Long received approval from Forms team, began merging
- `2024-02-14 @ 01:11 PM ET`: Merge is still held up.  Per Curt Bonade **looks like archive requires the full unit test step to be passing, regardless of it not being required for the initial merge (GitHub limitation on how you set branch protections and they donâ€™t line up with checking the status of the workflow step). Quickest route is likely the branch i merged that is going through CI now. That one should pass unit tests since the coverage report step is disabled, and if that deploys, we can send out the deploy from that commit and it will include yours**
