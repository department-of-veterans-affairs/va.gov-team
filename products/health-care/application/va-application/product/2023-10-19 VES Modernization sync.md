# Oct 19, 2023 | 1010<>VES Modernization: Sync

This is our meeting with the VES Modernization team, who has been working with HEC staff to understand the 10-10EZ application process from their perspective.
This includes 10-10EZ, Registration Only path and EZR processing

### Notes
- Claire shared some great stuff!
     - First 
          - Veteran submitted EZR
          - Staff couldn’t tell why Veteran submitted
          - Staff just entered info in system to see what might have changed
          - Veteran was PG8 - income too high (not enrolled)
          - After entering financials, found indication of Agent Orange
          - Had registered some time ago, but not interacted since PACT was in place
          - Is there a way to make it more clear/provide a way for the Veteran to provide a ‘reason’ for filling out the form?
          - What did that look like in the system?
               - Veteran overview page with subtabs. The top bar has name, DOB and Reg/Enroll status (enrolled PG#, or Registered PG8g? maybe)
     - Second
          - EZ with handwritten notes in the margins, written by Veteran’s daughter
          - Explained Veteran, who the wife is, who to contact (her)
          - This is very common!
     - Third
          - Enrolling for first time, but submitted EZR instead of EZ
          - Pretty common, staff says they don’t understand the difference between the forms
