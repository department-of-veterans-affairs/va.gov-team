- Jessica Soza - Hosting
- Fran - PRA Liason for VHA
- Grant Bennett - Fran's supervisor
- Laura Arcadipane - Deputy director

### EZR - still focusing on the Form being online like the EZ

- Patrick
     - We are providing an update where the Veteran updates other stuff, we dont want to recreate the form online

- Fran
     - Requirements have to be approved through OMB 
     - Would be necessary to recreate
          - Require OMB
          - Require PRA review
          - Etc
- Patrick sum up
     - if we have a digital version of the form, we can take a subset and put it on VA.gov profile

- Fran
     - Considering separate OMB for Profile data collection
     - OMB says have to establish system of record to protect 
     - Information collection - own OMB control number
     - Not yet completed, engaging in next steps in the process to possibly implement this

- Fran 
     - There are reqs under PRA that limit using Profile to update forms
     - Mentioned that they didnt want to block Veterans from filling out the form because they are being forced to create a VA.gov profile
- Simone
     - Advocating for creating an account to update
- Patrick
     - We shouldnt forego authentication/fraud prevention just because it doesnt exist via US Mail
     - We will provide a link to download the form online for those who do not have an account

- Patrick
     - Demo of how Direct Deposit exists today
     - Options provided
          - Change online
          - Call
          - Go to office
          - Download form
          - Log in and update on Profile page

- Fran
     - Concern about OMB number & exp date not being on Profile page
     - Legal requirements must be met to collect the data, no matter which way
          - PRA
          - Privacy Act
          - Etc
     - Fields need to be roughly the same
- Shana
     - We are not re-creating anything
     - We planned to have the OMB, Privacy statement, etc on the screen
- Patrick
     - Agrees that we would pull in that required information
- Fran
     - Directive 6309 out there (coming?) with reqs for all VA forms
     - (summarizing) as long as we meet requirements, we should be ok
     - Would be a good idea to have OMB desk officer on call to review for meeting reqs after/during development
- Simone
     - Why is this not being done the same as EZ?
 - Patrick
     - We got more info about the requirements, and our demo tomorrow should provide clarity
  
#### Slack message from Patrick
- the takeaway here is that we’ll likely need to indicate somewhere in/around/near the financial information update tool the following information:
     - Form number: 10-10EZR
     - Control number: 2900-0091
     - Estimated burden: 24 min
     - Expiration date: 06/30/2024
- **PRA statement:** The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 requires us to notify you that this information collection is in accordance with the clearance requirements of Section 3507 of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. We may not conduct or sponsor, and you are not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a valid OMB number. We anticipate that the time expended by all individuals who must complete this form will average 15 minutes. This includes the time it will take to read instructions, gather the necessary facts and fill out the form.
- **Privacy Act Information:** VA is asking you to provide the information on this form under 38 U.S.C. Sections 1710, 1712, and 1722 in order for VA to determine your eligibility for medical benefits. Information you supply may be verified from initial submission forward through a computer matching program. VA may disclose the information that you put on the form as permitted by law. VA may make a “routine use” disclosure of the information as outlined in the Privacy Act systems of records notices and in accordance with the Notice of Privacy Practices. Providing the requested information is voluntary, but if any or all of the requested information is not provided, it may delay or result in denial of your request for health care benefits. Failure to furnish the information will not have any effect on any other benefits to which you may be entitled. If you provide VA your Social Security Number, VA will use it to administer your VA benefits. VA may also use this information to identify veterans and persons claiming or receiving VA benefits and their records, and for other purposes authorized or required by law.
