# August 16, 2022 HEC Bi-weekly Health Care application update


### 8/16/22 Agenda Items
- Short form - Expansion on Service History
     - Reviewed each of the existing Service History items with Christopher H. and team
          - Each of the service history items require extensive verification, and some required financial details
          - The Short Form flow skips the Financial information section, and would not benefit the current process
          - [x]**Heather** to include presentation with notes for HEC team to review for any other opportunities with Stacey Echols
          - This enhancement will be placed in the backlog until we find other opportunities to expand Short Form eligibility
     - Annie mentioned that the more common complaint for uploading the DD214 is that they are not sure how to do that.
          - Possible opportunity to automate this, or at least find out if there is a digital copy that can be obtained outside of the application.
- Next of Kin section
     - Exists  on the paper form today
     - Has not been on the Online form for 5+ years
     - [ ] **HEC team** will decide if this should be a future initiative
          - This would result in new pages added to the form
