# September 28, 2022 HEC Bi-weekly Health Care application update

### 9/28/22 Agenda Items
- Short form status – Are we pass the 5% flow?
     - We are still at 5% with no issues to report. 
     - We are monitoring volume of Short Form applications started vs submitted, gearing up to perform UAT with Veterans to confirm usability and gather any other feedback
     - [ ]  **Heather** to collect and send Sentry details on where Veterans may be getting errors within the Short form flow that stopped them from submitting.
- Indian Health status – Have any issues come up since release?  Are we still at 25% flow?
     - We are at 25% with no issues to report
     - We plan to increase this to 50% on Thursday morning
     - [x] **Heather** to respond to previous email including folks to update on the increase
- Is there a way to get details around files that are uploaded for DD214 evidence, and whether or not the documents are acceptable?
     - For example, if a document was uploaded but it wasn't a DD214, instead it was a picture of a dog or a lunch menu - that would be considered not acceptable
     - We are curious if there are any issues or concerns around documents that are uploaded, and whether it is something we might want to look into.
     - There have not been any reports of issues or large volumes of incorrect/invalid documents - could check with EED team (Enrollment Eligibility Department)
          - [ ] **Tarsha** will send email to supervisory group to get the conversation started

- Household section
     - The Household section of the Online form has been reported as a difficult section to get through, some questions are not clear, and it can be overwhelming.
     - We are reviewing the section and considering some optimization to make the section easier to handle, easier to answer, quicker to complete and more accessible for applicants that may use alternative methods of navigating the form (assistive tech, zooming tools, etc)
     - QUESTION: How is the Spouse and Dependent information used, other than for financial implications?
          - Used for financials assessment (means test)and determine the priority group/enrollment status that the Veteran is eligible for
          - This is verified through SSN administration as well
          - If the Veteran chooses not to disclose financials, and does not have an eligible service history, they will receive a letter that they will not be enrolled, will be in 8G status.
          - Marital status question is still asked when the Veteran chooses not to disclose financials (no spouse details are collected).  Is this still needed?
               - [ ] **Heather** will review this more to check on the requirement of gathering the marital status
