# October 12, 2022 HEC Bi-weekly Health Care application update

### 10/12/22 Agenda Items
- Short form status
     - We are still at 5% with no issues to report. 
     - We are monitoring volume of Short Form applications started vs submitted
     - Planning to increase to 25% on Monday, 10/17
- Indian Health status
     - We are at 100% with no issues to report
- Self-Identifying Gender Identity
     - Shared current design with Tarsha and Christopher Hawkins
     - Tarsha raised concern that vocabulary terms on the online form do not match the paper form 
          - Extensive research has been done over the last year on gender identity, and how best to present the options for this highly sensitive topic
          - The Online Health apps Team explained that the terms used are in-line with plain language directives on VA.gov, providing conversational context rather than technical language
          - These terms are also aligned with the VA.gov Veteran's Profile page current design for this question for a consistent VA.gov experience
          - The gender identity options are listed in a logical, alphabetical order, to avoid any perceived importance or perceived valid order of genders
          - The Online Health apps designers meet with the VA.gov Content team on a routine basis to ensure the form is aligned with VA.gov content guidance, specifically around these sensitive topics
     - [X] Heather to send a screenshot with the above talking points to Tarsha for discussion with HEC leadership
