### 06/19/2023 PO Synch with Patrick & Kristen

### Reg Only
- Maybe we need to suggest a look at revising EZ to remove registration
     - Biz rules in ES to determine/handle reg-enrolment
     - If there are very specific use cases (C&P exam), we can address those
- Seems like reg only is done at the facility by staff (emergency/urgent visits, Veteran families, vaccinations [humanitarian]), going online is not necessarily something people would do
- Looking for clear, compelling reasons why someone would want to register online
     - Is it purely about Veterans who want care for their SC only & nothing else?
     - Could be healthcare exchanges related (healthcare.gov requirement for some states)


- We've talked to some facilities & FL staff
     - We are still searching for compelling reasons to go online to register instead of enroll
     - Regardless, the system will put them in whatever PG they belong
     - If main reason is OIG recommendation, we need to see it


### EZR
- Financial info update is the primary reason to submit
- Enable Veterans to access current financial information in profile (assumption) & allow them to update it
- We will build this (financial info), not waiting to be on someone elseâ€™s roadmap
     - Talk with Joshua F on data flow to ES
     - Next mtg (7/5/2023) - Talk about what we want to do & show wireframes/rough design to get started
     - Start process
- Needs to be discussion with IVM and other HEC folks about financial info we have and if they are doing income matching with IRS, are they updating the financial info in ES or are they keeping the info the same as entered
     - Verify we can show it (if user entry)
     - If IRS overwrite, can we still show it? And how would we explain (we obtained from IRS) 
     - & provide way to update it
     - Or click button & get data from IRS
     - This could be MVP for IRS integration
- Tiny MVP to consider - View financial information but not change it
### Priority Groups - Separate initiative or addition to Financial Info
- Could be displayed with name & rating banner
- Could include info on benefit that comes with PG (on financial info page)
