#Apr 8, 2024 | 10-10 team<>Product Lead - Bi-weekly touchbase

### Notes
- EZR/TERA launch
     - Any objections to release this Wednesday?
          - None from Patrick or the team
- EZ Reg Only
     - Any more thoughts on the MVP audience?
          - No further thoughts on this feature
     - Team consensus: If we want to see whether this is a viable option for the online form, then we should target the most likely audience, which is the service-connected only care group (10-40% disability rating).
          - This approach will be put in place before VES will be ready, as it will not require input to be sent downstream
          - This approach is agreed upon by Patrick and team
     - Have some questions for HEC stakeholders and will talk with them about gathering data, such as number of phone calls, especially after we launch
We will be tracking via Google analytics from the website
- Future topic with Kristen: Whatâ€™s next for the 10-10 forms

  <Summary>PO Sync transcript</Summary>

- [Alex Seelig] 15:33:01
     - Yeah, no, that's okay. Hey, Patrick, I will keep this quick.
     - Can we go for launch on Wednesday? We, have pretty much I mean, we've got a couple of little things that we'll be looking at between today and tomorrow, but.
     - Other than that, we're good to go, so. I I will take your thumbs up as a legally binding go and.

- [Patrick] 15:33:25
     - Go for it.

- [Alex Seelig] 15:33:27
     - Sweet, I will not read you the release plan as previously agree. Okay, that's literally it for me.
     - Heather, over to you.

- [Heather] 15:33:38
     - Hey, I hope that's alright. Okay, so just a real quick thing about registration only.
     - I know Patrick would kind of have a little bit of discussion last week about it and kind of trying toTalk about the target audience. I was just wondering if you had any more thoughts about that. If there's anything else you wanted to share.

- [Patrick] 15:34:01
     - No, I mean, I haven't thought about it since we talked on Friday.

- [Heather] 15:34:03
     - So, That's totally fine.

- [Patrick] 15:34:08
     - Thank you. A weekend thought topic.

- [Heather] 15:34:11
     - Yeah, well, I think what we're gonna do, you know, after thinking about it a little bit myself, unfortunately I had nothing to do but paint so you know when staring at a blank wall you start thinking about work so I think that We want to stick with the service connected care only and I think that that was like the highest population of people who did register for care and I feel like we want to really see if this is a viable option for online use then we should go after a target audience that's going to give us at least a picture of it. if we go to a smaller group we may not get what we're looking for may not get anything, I don't know. So I think this is probably the most viable group. To be able to get an idea of whether or not this is something we should continue to pursue.

- [Patrick] 15:35:02
     - That's totally fine.

- [Heather] 15:35:04
     - Okay. Angela, Jessica, is there anything else you want to add or do you have any questions or anything else you want to clear up?

- [Angela Agosto] 15:35:20
     - No, so I, I think we just wanted to make sure. We're all aligned before we talk to our HEC stakeholders on Wednesday about our approach before the enrollment system is ready. And we will be. Okay, cool. And we won't really be sharing with them like what our user full thoughts are for later because we are.

- [Patrick] 15:35:34
     - Yeah, I think that. Yeah.

- [Angela Agosto] 15:35:45
     - Going to kind of monitor analytics and see how that does and. Don't wanna, you know, promise anything to them that we're not sure if we'll do or not.

- [Patrick] 15:35:52
     - Yeah, sounds good. Yeah, I mean, just I think slow and steady with them. That's a way to go.
     - So yeah, no, all good with that.

- [Angela Agosto] 15:35:59
     - Okay, cool.

- [Heather] 15:36:02
     - Awesome. Okay.

- [Jessica] 15:36:03
     - We did talk with Kristen this morning about we want to talk with HEC about the data, like how we make sure we're tracking it on all ends through Google Analytics and tracking like phone calls so we can get that data pull the show like numbers before numbers after to make sure we get all that dialed in as well. So we want to talk through those couple of questions on Wednesday.

- [Patrick] 15:36:32
     - Yeah, sounds good. I mean, I feel like getting data out of them has always been. Challenging.

- [Heather] 15:36:42
     - Yeah, I mean, we can at least ask for it. I figure if we don't get it, then we're not losing anything we don't have today.
     - Okay, awesome. I think that was it. Anything else from the group or even you, Patrick?

- [Patrick] 15:37:05
     - Nothing specifically.
     - Kristen had mentioned that there was sort of some interest in discussing, you know, like sort of what comes next, at least on the UX front, which I'm happy to talk about, but I'm also happy to save for another day.
     - She had some ideas that actually might be better just to all do it together.

- [Heather] 15:37:26
     - Yeah

- [Patrick] 15:37:28
     - But yeah, up to you all.

- [Heather] 15:37:30
     - Okay.
     - Yeah, I think let's have everybody together that way we can cover all the basis
     - Okay. Okay. Anything else?

- [Patrick] 15:37:44
     - No, good.

- [Alex Seelig] 15:37:45
     - Yeah, sorry, I just. Yeah, just thought of one thing. So for Wednesday, I'm gonna reach out to Stephen Barrs and Patrick, thank you for connecting him with us. To see if we can get away for him to hit the site. He mentioned he was traveling.
     - So I'm just gonna, if, if we can catch some, if not, not, but, you know, we'll have him hit it whenever he gets a chance.
     - Basically. Is there any? Yeah, good.

- [Patrick] 15:38:12
     - Yeah, I mean. I guess for him you should be able to like give him some instructions, add them to the allow list for the toggle and then do whatever.

- [Alex Seelig] 15:38:19
     - Yeah. Cool. That.

- [Patrick] 15:38:22
     - Cause he's, yeah, he's traveling up to Philadelphia from Florida tomorrow and then we'll be at the off site.
     - Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, or helping travel. So, yeah, I would say get him instructions and put him on the Allow us soon rather than later and then he could do it like when he's in transit or whatever.

- [Alex Seelig] 15:38:31
     - Okay.
     - Perfect. Perfect. And then I just have a list of like telling Sarah Steckenberg with my healthy vet because she needs to update.
     - A link there I believe Obviously just gonna let HEC know, you know, hey, we're live.
     - Anybody else or anything else? To announce and you don't have to answer now. I can think of anything between.

- [Patrick] 15:39:08
     - Yeah.

- [Alex Seelig] 15:39:10
     - No, on Wednesday.

- [Patrick] 15:39:11
     - Yeah, no, I mean I would I think that's fine like I mean I would just reply to that thread that has Stacy and Ryan on it and letting them know we can do later in the week if you want to make a note of it there is like that larger member services distribution list that we've been asked to use previously.
     - I'd say like once everything's in the clear, we can just send a, you know, hey, we're, you know, it's live, no doubt.
     - Like towards the end of the week or beginning next week, just for some visibility, but.

- [Alex Seelig] 15:39:38
     - Cool.

- [Patrick] 15:39:41
     - Yeah, no, that's it. I mean, just, you know, keep all of the you know, keep everyone up to date in the channel.
     - And I will track it.

- [Alex Seelig] 15:39:49
     - Cool, sounds good. Okay, that's that's all I have.

- [Patrick] 15:39:54
     - Cool.

- [Patrick] 15:40:04
     - Hmm. Got a little shady and now it's getting a little blushing. That's about it.

- [Heather] 15:40:15
     - All right, I won't keep you much longer. Thank you so much, Patrick, for joining and we'll talk to you next time.
