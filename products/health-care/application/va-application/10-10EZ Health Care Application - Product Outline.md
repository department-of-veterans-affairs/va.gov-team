## Assumptions
- If we make the online health care application:
  - More user friendly 
  - Give clearer explanation of required information & why it is required
  - Shorten the form to collect the minimum of what is needed to begin processing
  -  Provide reminders for authenticated users who have saved application, but not returned to it
-  then more Veterans will complete the health care application online.

## Solution Approach

- In 2026, we're going to focus on:
   - Improve the communication of application statuses
   - Look at creating less of a form experience and more of a wholistic health experience, minimize the burden for the Veteran

--- 

## Go-to-market Strategy
- Coordinating with other VA outreach initiatives 
- Support from VAMCs

## Solution Narrative

### Designs
- [Figma production file](https://www.figma.com/design/W1cs6Gjx3MR5VU0EjurHLZ/10-10EZ-Production?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=JhxW0BXZeM2oyPIO-0) for production source of truth
- [Figma working file](https://www.figma.com/design/UljiHam46o5DItC5iDgmPd/10-10EZ-Working-File?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=07vffO2rqs00iBsG-0) for work in progress, proposals and experiments

### Key Decisions
- Reference the ["Things to know" document](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/10-10EZ%20Form/10-10EZ%20-%20Things%20to%20know.md) for various notes that we collected and documented
- American Indian question
   - The decision to phrase the Indian health question, by listing the qualifications/definitions of "Indian", was made due to the HEC Leadership stakeholders questioning our decision to phrase the question initially as "Are you an American Indian or Alaska Native?" rather than match the paper form verbiage "Are you an Indian?".  Our initial Online language had been approved in late 2021, however once we were ready to release in August 2022, the language format came up again.  Reference the [Stakeholder meeting notes]https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/product/Bi-weekly%20Stakeholder%20Mtg%20notes from August and September 2022.
   - As of December 2022, there was notice from the HEC stakeholders that the question may be removed from both the Online and Paper versions of the application, per the Member Services leadership. On 2/23/2023, we were notified that the 10-10EZ Paper form had been updated, and the question was removed. As of 2/27/2023, we have removed the American Indian question and code from the Online form.
- Self-Identifying Gender Identity (SIGI)
   - The decision to use the terms on this feature to identify various Gender types was made based on extensive research on this topic in 2021, aligning with the current format in the VA.gov Profile, and using plain language to reflect a comfortable, conversational format.  The HEC Leadership stakeholders have questioned the use of the terms on the Online form being different from the paper form (Man vs Male, Woman vs Female, etc), and have submitted to CICPO (Compliance integrity) for review.  Reference the [Stakeholder meeting notes](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/product/Bi-weekly%20Stakeholder%20Mtg%20notes) from October and November 2022.
   - This work never came to fruition and all code was removed from the form.
