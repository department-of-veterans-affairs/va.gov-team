## Assumptions
- If we make the online health care application:
  - More user friendly 
  - Give clearer explanation of required information + why it is required
  - Shorten the form to collect the minimum of what is needed to begin processing
  -  Provide reminders for authenticated users who have saved application, but not returned to it
-  then more Veterans will complete the health care application online.

## Solution Approach

- As of 10/2020, we're going to focus on:
 - Updating the UI to meet VA.gov design & accessibility standards
 - Adding a question distinguishing between mailing & residential addressses
 - Updating the questions on the online form to align with the new 10-10EZ
- As of 11/2020, we're going to focus on:
   - Validating assumptions regarding usage of the online form pre- and during COVID
   - Using that research to guide whether to focus our Q1 efforts on the form itself or how Veterans get to the form.
- As of 04/2021-05/2021, we're going to focus on:
   - Understanding what Veteran pain points are with the current application process (research and discovery)
   - Gain insight on offline workarounds used by VA staff who process applications
   - Updating any content around the health care application pages that may be a source of confusion
   - Understanding what methods can be used to prompt authenticated users to return to the application after save/exit
- As of 05/2021, we're going to focus on:
   - Testing design and content iterations based on research discovery to improve user experience
- As of 01/2022, we're going to focus on:
   - Creating dashboards in Datadog
   - Implementing Short-form Ph 1
