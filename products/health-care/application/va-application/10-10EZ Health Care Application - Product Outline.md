## Assumptions
- If we make the online health care application:
  - More user friendly 
  - Give clearer explanation of required information & why it is required
  - Shorten the form to collect the minimum of what is needed to begin processing
  -  Provide reminders for authenticated users who have saved application, but not returned to it
-  then more Veterans will complete the health care application online.

## Solution Approach

- As of 11/2022, we're going to focus on:
   - Improving the flow and burden of completing the Household section of the form
   - Continue gaining insights from various metrics and Medallia feedback

--- 

## Go-to-market Strategy
- Coordinating with other VA outreach initiatives 
- Support from VAMCs


## Launch Dates
Note: 10-10 EZ form has been available online for a number of years.  Only in 2019, had the form been regularly revisited for updates and improvements. ([archived docs](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/application/vets-application/product))
- 2012: Fillable PDF avalable to submit online (vets.gov)
- May 2016: Online form created with data fields and submission online (no more PDF), content & data fields match PDF form (vets.gov)
- 6/3/2019: Enrollment record validation when user enters personal info, if no record found, user can proceed through the form
- 8/23/2022: Medicare Claim number field added to the form
- 10/11/2022: American Indian question added to the form
- 10/31/2022: 10-10EZ Short Form
     - Trending 30%-40% application submission being through the Short Form flow, and a 98% submission rate of total Short Form applications.
- 11/1/2022: 10-10EZ Saved-in-progress email reminders

## Solution Narrative

### Current Status

- As of 11/2022, we are:
   - Preparing for moderated research sessions on the Household section optimization design in December
   - Preparing for moderated research sessions on the entire form to gather baseline data and feedback
        - This will help inform our next initiatives

### Designs
- [Sketch file](https://www.sketch.com/s/da85cf44-4503-4e98-834e-ff068b242ef6) with wireflows and page designs (including proposals and experiments)

### Key Decisions
- Reference the ["Things to know" document](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/10-10EZ%20Form/10-10EZ%20-%20Things%20to%20know.md) for various notes that we collected and documented
- American Indian question
   - The decision to phrase the Indian health question, by listing the qualifications/definitions of "Indian", was made due to the HEC Leadership stakeholders questioning our decision to phrase the question initially as "Are you an American Indian or Alaska Native?" rather than match the paper form verbiage "Are you an Indian?".  Our initial Online language had been approved in late 2021, however once we were ready to release in August 2022, the language format came up again.  Reference the [Stakeholder meeting notes]https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/product/Bi-weekly%20Stakeholder%20Mtg%20notes from August and September 2022.
   - As of December 2022, there was notice from the HEC stakeholders that the question may be removed from both the Online and Paper versions of the application, per the Member Services leadership. On 2/23/2023, we were notified that the 10-10EZ Paper form had been updated, and the question was removed. As of 2/27/2023, we have removed the American Indian question from the Online form.
- Self-Identifying Gender Identity (SIGI)
   - The decision to use the terms on this feature to identify various Gender types was made based on extensive research on this topic in 2021, aligning with the current format in the VA.gov Profile, and using plain language to reflect a comfortable, conversational format.  The HEC Leadership stakeholders have questioned the use of the terms on the Online form being different from the paper form (Man vs Male, Woman vs Female, etc), and have submitted to CICPO (Compliance integrity) for review.  Reference the [Stakeholder meeting notes]https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/product/Bi-weekly%20Stakeholder%20Mtg%20notes from October and November 2022.
