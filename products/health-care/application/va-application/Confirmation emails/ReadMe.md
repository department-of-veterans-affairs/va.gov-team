- Confirmation Email [Epic #40765](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/10-10-health-apps-5fff0cfd1462b6000e320fc7/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/40765)

## Problem
Currently, the confirmation email is sent by a Java Mail client, triggered once the Enrollment system receives the application from VA.gov.  The email process needs to move to the target state application VA Notify.


## Desired User Outcomes
- Veterans are notified timely once their application has been recieved by the system.

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Frustration in receiving email notifications they did not want
- Frustration in not receiving an expected confirmation email after they submitted their application

## Desired Business Outcomes
- Veterans are informed of VA having received their submitted application

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- Emails not being sent out timely or at all

## Discovery
### Assumptions/Risks

- **Value Risks** (will people use it): 
  - The value risk is that applicants will ignore the confirmation emails. They could also route these emails to their spam/junk folder without realizing what it is for.  
  - There is also a risk that an email cannot be sent, if the Veteranâ€™s profile or the application does not include an email address.
- **Usability Risks** (can people figure out how to use it):
  - ????
- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data):
   - TBD
  
- **Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact):
  - Integration between Enrollment system and VA Notify
  - Scheduling the integration, timeline is long


### Solution Summary
- In-scope:
     - Confirmation Email to be sent through VA Notify template process for applications that have been submitted and received by Enrollment System
     - Email will be sent using the ???? profile ID or ICN of the logged in applicant or the email address in the application
- Out of scope:
     - Any other email notifications
