## Research Goals
The concept of registration and enrollment, if they are steps in the process or the same thing, was found to be confusing during the initial generative research with Veterans. Choosing between these labels did not align with the Veteran's mental model of going about health care eligibility and the application process.

- [Link to generative mental model study folder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/research/2023-06-Registration%20flow%20exploration)

Looking at this from the perspective of registration reasons as scenarios Veterans may have when applying for health care benefits and completing a 10-10EZ, we want to learn the paths taken within VA.gov and if the Veteran reports going to the existing application or another location on the website.

**Registration reasons scenarios for this test**
- Service Connected Only
- C&P Disability Benefits Exam
- Mental health care (Other)
- Marriage/Family counseling
- ART/IVF

**Research Goals**
- Learn more about **WHERE** on VA.gov do Veterans expect to complete tasks related to registration reasons.
- Discover **WHAT** actions Veterans take prior to seeking care for registration reasons.
- Learn more about the Veteran's mental model of what they are getting when they sign up for their registration reason vs enrolling in VA health care. 



## Research Questions

**Learn more about WHERE on VA.gov do Veterans expect to complete tasks related to registration reasons.**
- Do Veterans navigate to the 10-10EZ for registration reasons?
- If somebody is looking to sign up  for [registration reason scenario] from VA, how would they do that?
- How easy is it for the Veterans to navigate to the [registration reason scenario] starting point?

**Discover WHAT actions Veterans take prior to seeking care for registration reasons.**
- Do Veterans mention offline channels as the preferred method of "registering" for these reasons?
- What do Veterans expect to happen next when registering for [registration reason scenario]?
- Do Veterans expect to have to take action (if needed) to enroll after registering?


**Learn more about the Veteran's mental model of what they are getting when they sign up for their registration reason vs enrolling in VA health care.**
- Do the registration reasons align with the Veterans' mental model of signing up for health care from the VA?
- Do Veterans expect to get only the [registration reason] they signed up for or more health care benefits in their application? 


## Methodology 

- Unmoderated tree test 

#### Notes on Validity
- We found out after the study closed and post-syntheseis some of the top-level tiers of Search, General Support, and Veteran Outreach should not have been represented as top level tiers in the tree, as they are not navigated to in this way on the site, even though the tree reflected the URL IA.
- We noted the tasks where there was a higher percentage of first tasks clicks on these hubs as having validity concerns. 


## Hypotheses and Conclusions

We assume that for the appointment registration scenarios - like a C&P exam - Veteran's will navigate to the disability claims or locations hubs in the tree test.
- **Maybe true**
- For the C&P exam task, Facilities and locations was the highest first click destination at 37%. Other tasks with appointments did not have as high of a first click rate on the locations hub. Users also navigated to the benefit hubs (disability or health care) 54% of the time.

We assume that for service connected care, Veteran's will navigate to the health care hub and the apply for benefits node.
- **Likely false**
- Reason: Participants had a low success rate for this task at 23% and often navigated to the disability hub.

We hypothesize that Veterans who do are eligible to register for NSC reasons, expect to sign up from a variety of locations on the site specific to the care they are seeking, such as mental health or counseling care.
- **Maybe true**
- Participants navigated to many other areas of the site than the direct path to the 10-10EZ application / get benefits. Direct navigation to the 10-10EZ node was low. More information, though, is needed to confirm Veteran expectations around navigation.


## Key Findings

1. Veterans are not navigating to the 10-10EZ form for registration reasons
2. Confusion around registration and enrollment terminology within the health care benefits space
3. Veterans reported a preference to sign up online but wanted additional benefits in-person
4. For some of the registration reasons, scheduling the appointment while signing up was a preference
5. Wanting the VA to recommend and inform of more benefits



## Details of Findings 


**Finding 1 - Veterans are not navigating to the EZ form for registration reasons**

Labels: [AUD: Veterans], [BNFT: Healthcare], [PRDT: Benefit hubs], [PRDT: health-care-application], [RESRCH: Tree Test], [RESRCH: Unmoderated], [VETJNY: Getting out Military], [VETJNY: Taking care of themselves] 


All tasks under 35% success rate. Other hubs and areas of the site were often navigated to over health care > get benefits > apply page suggesting that registration reasons we tested did not align with applying/enrolling VA health care in the Veteran's mental model. 

**Finding Details**
- Task 1 (Service Connected Only) = 23% Success 
- Task 2 (Mental Health / Other) = 34% Success
- Task 3 (C&P Exam) = 26% Success
- Task 4 (Marriage/Family Counseling) = 11% Success
- Task 5 (ART/IVF) = 31% Success


**Finding 2 - Confusion around registration and enrollment terminology within the health care benefits space**

Labels: [AUD: Veterans], [BNFT: Healthcare], [PRDT: Benefit hubs], [PRDT: health-care-application], [RESRCH: Tree Test], [RESRCH: Unmoderated], [VETJNY: Getting out Military], [VETJNY: Taking care of themselves] 


The common themes were that either registration and enrollment was the same thing; or the theme that they were steps in the process of applying and qualifying. 

**Finding details**
- (11) Commented around the steps in the process of applying/signing up and qualifying after VA review to enroll and get benefits.
- (8) Commented that registration and enrollment was the same thing
- (5) Commented that it was different and it was about eligibility
- (4) Commented both were just about getting help from the VA


**Finding 3**
Labels: [AUD: Veterans], [BNFT: Healthcare], [PRDT: Benefit hubs], [PRDT: health-care-application], [RESRCH: Tree Test], [RESRCH: Unmoderated], [VETJNY: Getting out Military], [VETJNY: Taking care of themselves] 


Most participants reported online being their preference of signing up for health care benefits but for learning about additional benefits, in person and email were the top methods reported. 

**Finding details**
- Pre-Study Question: 90% would prefer to sign up for a health care benefit online
- Informed of Additional Benefits Preference: At an appointment/in person (17), Email (29), Letter in the mail (18)

**Note**

**Finding 4**

Labels: [AUD: Veterans], [BNFT: Healthcare], [PRDT: Benefit hubs], [PRDT: health-care-application], [RESRCH: Tree Test], [RESRCH: Unmoderated], [VETJNY: Getting out Military], [VETJNY: Taking care of themselves] 


Four of the tasks when asked, the majority of participants reported wanting to schedule their first appointment when they are signing up for that benefit/registration reason. 

**Finding details**
- Task 1 (Service Connected Only) = NA
- Task 2 (Mental Health / Other) = 91.4%
- Task 3 (C&P Exam) = 88.6%
- Task 4 (Marriage/Family Counseling) = 85.7%
- Task 5 (ART/IVF) = 77.1%


**Finding 5**

Labels: [AUD: Veterans], [BNFT: Healthcare], [PRDT: Benefit hubs], [PRDT: health-care-application], [RESRCH: Tree Test], [RESRCH: Unmoderated], [VETJNY: Getting out Military], [VETJNY: Taking care of themselves] 



The post task question for 3 tasks asked about being informed of what they are eligible for - getting help from the VA and being told what they qualify for and the specific steps they have to take.

**Finding details**
- Service Connected Only Task - Help from the VA (8), Qualify + Steps (5), Call (6)
- Mental Health Task - Help from the VA (4), Qualify + Steps (5), Call (6), More Paperwork (5)
- Marriage/Family Counseling Task: Help from the VA (10), Qualify + Steps (5), Call (5), Sign up again (4)

## Additional Insights

- From the Veteran's point of view, the line is blurry between disability and health care benefits. Comments and quotes re-iterate the theme that they are a package deal to the Veteran when they are applying. 


## Recommendations


* Align with Veteran's mental model
    * Align with the Veteran's mental model around the registration and enrollment terms, process and eligibility prioritization. This could create a more streamlined process for the Veterans when signing up and applying for health care benefits.
    * This process could look like a simple registration step, checking eligibility then determining enrollment.
    * Test the concept of a health care application hub via low-fi wireframes and storyboards.


* Veteran health services/registration reasons need a variety of paths on VA.gov to complete the form/application.
    * Allow for more links to sign up for health care from the perspective of the Veteran - what care or health service are they seeking to sign up for.
    * The locations hub under health care services locations could be an area to recommend link to health care "registration"
    * The locations pages/hub and the disability hub are the more prominent areas of the site to focus on possible registartion entrances. 

* Ensure there is a simplified path online where the Veteran can learn about more health care benefits if they want to move from registration only to enrollment in medical benefits package.
    * Consider the journeys of each individual registration reason.
    * Create journey maps out of research findings and include working sessions with stakeholders as part of the process. 


* More visibility into health services and care available that are personalized based on eligibility
    * Personalized recommendations to Veterans via email or in-person at appointments to better understand additional health care services they are eligible for. 





## Next Steps

* Determine top registration reasons to work on first.
* Collaborate with HEC stakeholders in journey map creation
* Low-fi wireframes of "health care benefits application hub" concept.
* Test the low-fi wireframes with Veterans.
