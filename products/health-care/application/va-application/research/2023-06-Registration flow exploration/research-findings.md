## Research Goals
How might we enable Veterans who simply want to register for a specific level of care — up to and including the full medical benefits package — do that instead of processing all applications as enrollment applications? The outcomes of this initiative including getting Veterans access to the health care benefits for their needs in a transparent and simple process while asking only for the information required for their circumstance (future "short form" growth)

This is a generative study to gain an understanding of the current mental model of Veterans in regards to different benefit types of health care coverage.

This impacts the Veteran journey during through the phases on starting up to aging. This impacts the key momemet that matters during the starting up phase and selecting health care coverage that meets their specific needs. 

- [See the Veteran journey map](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)

**Research Goals**
- Learn if Veterans who have recently started receiving health care benefits are aware of the terms and difference between registration and enrollment as it pertains to them and the process to getting the level the care they want/need.

- Learn more about Veteran's mental model when applying for health care benefits and the terms they use (apply, enroll, register, etc) and how they see levels of care during the health care application process.

- Learn more about how Veterans would like to go about applying, discovering eligibility and getting the most health care benefits they qualify for and what amount of information they need to provide in that process.


## Research Questions

**Our goal is to learn if Veterans who have recently started receiving health care benefits are aware of the terms and difference between registration and enrollment as it pertains to them.**

- What is the experience of "registering only" today?
- Are Veterans aware that they registered or just that they declined enrollment?
- What are the reasons a Veteran would decline to enroll in health care when completing the application?

**Learn more about Veteran's mental model when applying for health care benefits and the terms they use (apply, enroll, register, etc) and how they see levels of care during the health care application process.**

- Are Veterans aware of the health care differences between enrollment and registration?
- What terms do Veterans use when describing if they are enrolled or registered for health care benefits?
- What is the Veteran's mental model of discovering, getting and keeping health care benefits as they go through the application process?

**Learn more about how Veterans would like to go about applying, discovering eligibility and getting the most health care benefits they qualify for and what amount of information they need to provide in that process.**

- What are the Veteran's current pain points with how the health care application impacts the overall benefits journey?
- What do Veterans expect from the order and process of applying (registering or enrolling) for health care benefits?
- When does it make sense to Veterans to go through eligibility based questions? (before, during or after application)
- What other applications/claims/VA services must Veterans interact with that could change their choice from registeration to enrollment in the full medical benefits package?

## Methodology 

The methodolgy used was structured interviews with questions focused on the current application experience, understanding of benefits and eligibility, ideal state then getting reactions from an example of current instructions on the 10-10EZ paper form.




## Hypotheses and Conclusions

We assume that Veterans will not use the term "registration only" when referring to health care benefits, but will be familiar with enrollment and eligibility.
- **Definitely true**
- Zero participants used the term "registration only," and many participants expressed confusion around the difference between registration and enrollment in that they seemed like the same thing. We had another smaller group of participants associate them as steps in the overall process. 

We assume that Veterans will use the term registration when they are talking about choosing their main VA medical facility for care, not applying for benefits.
- **Likely false**
- Participants who reported being enrolled in health care benefits did not mention anything to do with facilities when asked about the term registration. They mentioned care, filling out an application, getting benefits but not choosing a specific facility. 
  
We assume adding the term/step of "registration" will add to the confusion around health care benefits.
- **Definitely true**
- Only 1 participant out of the 10 found the registration and enrollment benefit option descriptions to be clear and not confusing. 3 participants felt it was more of a step in the process and it should be automatic.
  
We assume not all Veterans can complete the enrollment process in one go, that there are often stops, such as an exam and claims filed in between.
- **Likely true**
- Participants often crossed and mixed disability benefits with health benefits in their answers and mental models.  


  
## Key Findings

1. Finding one - Veterans are confused about the registration and enrollment options

2. Finding two - Veterans want more education and explanation around health care benefits

3. Finding three - Veterans see disability and health care benefits as the same process 

4. Finding four - Veterans are mostly unaware of their Priority Group

5. Finding five - Veterans want personalized and automatic benefit recommendations




## Details of Findings 


### Finding 1 - Veterans are confused about the registration and enrollment options

Labels: [AUD: Veterans], [BNFT: Healthcare], [PRDT: Content], [PRDT: Form 10-10 EZ], [VETJNY: Taking care of themselves]

Participants mostly found the paper instructions confusing in some way, either using the terms interchangeably or seeing them as steps in the health care process. 

**Finding details**
- 6 out of 10 find the options confusing or to be the same
- 3 out of 10 see registration as a step in a process
- 4 out of 10 reported they would select both options just to be sure

> P12: “To me it doesn't make any sense. What is the difference between medical package and health services?"

> P6: "So I guess with this, I don't understand the difference between enrollment and registration I find this a little bit, not a little bit but quite confusing."

> P20: "What first do you have would have to out enroll in it. Then once I'm enrolled, get registered."



### Finding 2 - Veterans want more education and explanation around health care benefits

Labels: [AUD: Veterans], [BNFT: Healthcare], [PRDT: Content], [PRDT: Form 10-10 EZ], [VETJNY: Taking care of themselves]

Participants expressed wanting more information and resources for them to understand how to use their health care benefits and what they had available to them.

**Finding details**
- 7 out of 10 reported that there was no explanation given to them and they had to learn on their own as they were using their health care benefits
- 3 out of 10 mentioned a video pre-recorded or a virtual video call to talk through health benefits

> P18: “I've made more than my fair share of phone calls to get information on benefits.

> P16: "Without that piece of paper my primary gave me, I wouldn't know about my glasses per se I wish there was a section on the dashboard that would say all benefits eligible for,

> P6: There was nothing in there saying 'Hey, this is how it works'


### Finding 3 - Veterans see disability and health care benefits as the same process

Labels: [AUD: Veterans], [BNFT: Healthcare], [BNFT: Disability], [PRDT: Content], [PRDT: Form 10-10 EZ], [VETJNY: Taking care of themselves]

Veterans conflated disability benefits and the disability compensation process with health care benefits and the healthcare application process.

**Finding details**
- 8 out of 10 participants talked about filing disability claims when asked about their health care benefits application process 
- 7 out of 10 participants talked about their disability rating impacting their health care benefits; they saw the two benefits as being connected in their minds. 

> P16: It was not clear to him during the long disability process that it did not include health care, thought that was part of the process, not separate

> P19: "Well if it was, for the next generation, if it was just plain if you have this percentage or this is what you get right here."

> P12: "So you could be at 50% disability but not yet registered in health care?" ... "There should be automation between claims and health care, not separate processes."




### Finding 4 - Veterans are mostly unaware of their Priority Group

Labels: [AUD: Veterans], [BNFT: Healthcare], [PRDT: Content], [PRDT: Form 10-10 EZ], [VETJNY: Taking care of themselves]

The term Priority Group was mostly new to participants, those who had heard it before connected it to disability rating tiers. 

**Finding details**
- 6 out of 10 were not aware of this term and never heard it before
- 4 out of 10 have, but did not understand why or they associated it with disability rating
- 2 out of 10 seemed confident they were in Priority Group 1 / the highest priority

> P11: Not familiar with Priority Group, thinks it is based on when and where the Veterans served.

> P8: Not familiar with Priority Group, thinks it is connected to Mental Health.

> P18: “I believe I'm in the highest priority because it was service-connected. It happened overseas in Iraq in a war zone, so I believe it's the highest priority.


### Finding 5 - Veterans want personalized and automatic benefit recommendations

Labels: [AUD: Veterans], [BNFT: Healthcare], [BNFT: All], [PRDT: Content], [PRDT: Form 10-10 EZ], [VETJNY: Taking care of themselves]

Personalized and easy to find lists of what benefits were available to them was a common ideal state expressed by participants - both VA wide and specifically within health care benefits.

**Finding details**
- 5 out of 10 participants wanted benefit eligibility to be presented to them to choose from 
- 5 out of 10 participants felt they should be registered for VA health care automatically

> P10: “The VA knows all my info, let me choose my benefits"

> P12: Should be presented with what they are eligible for in a personalized way

> P16: Wants a personalized dashboard list of benefits eligible for

> P19: " I mean it is basically what you have to do if you are a civilian too, but since we have been through the service and had tricare it should have already been there. It should have been automatic."





## Additional Insights


### Secondary Finding 1 - There is a steep learning curve for Veterans when using VA services

Veterans reported the process to be frustrating and intimidating when searching for and understanding benefits and services available and they had to learn as they went.


**Finding details**
- All 10 out of 10 participants said they found the VA processes and applications to be confusing, intimidating or annoying. 
- 4 out of 10 called out confusing language and terminology when reading about VA benefits
- 6 out of 10 called out the effort of searching and finding information around VA benefits as being difficult
- There is often a learning curve with VA terminology and the process to discovering benefits available

> P1: “The applications jargons are gobbledygook, "this stuff looks like Greek to us" and would need someone to translate for something that should be 25 words.

> P16: "So many people don’t want to try because of confusion and frustration." 

> P16: Simplified terms would be better Other than that, once I started to get into it and learn about it Had to get to that point of learning the terminology

> P12: There is a language barrier issue, they may have degrees and everything don't fault any one for that, they don't listen 


### Secondary Finding 2 - The burden of proof often falls upon the Veteran

Some participants expressed that the process of applying and getting any benefits from the VA as feeling intimidating and difficult. 


**Finding details**
> 5 out of 10 participants mentioned frustration with having to provide information to the VA for their claims and benefits

> P10: “It was difficult to share the incident/first claim because the VA knows so much, but they didn't have these details".. Why do I always have to prove my information with the VA"

> P18: As far as compensation goes, I had to fight for that. They weren't connecting my cancer with the heart disease I have that came from chemo/radiation. Disabled Veterans Association helped with compensation.


### Secondary Finding 3 - Veterans desire for high-touch, personal assistance around benefits

Some participants expressed that having personalized assistance through the benefits process would be beneficial so they could ask specific questions and receive accurate answers. 

**Finding details**
- 5 out of 10 participants mentioned a person to talk to during the benefits application process would be helpful

> P11: “But nobody was there to guide me. It would be great if they had like a liaison person that someone could call, explain the benefits."

> P10: Likes phone call follow-ups because they feel like people care

> P18: Participant relies on and appreciates the help from Disabled Veterans Association and onsite Patient Advocates, but had to discover these options himself


## Recommendations

[DRAFT]
- Explore possible form flows around “registration and enrollment paths” for discussion and testing with Veterans and non-Veterans. 
- Help guide the Veteran through the health care benefits choice with plain language questions around their eligibility status and personal situation.
- More focused future research around how Priority Groups impact a Veteran’s awareness and understanding of PGs impact on the health care application and their personal benefits available and maintenance they have to take.
- Future testing of hypotheses flow(s) with updated and simplified questions to determine if that helps reduce confusion and get Veterans/non-Veterans into the benefit status that is the most applicable to them. 
- Future discovery on if health care enrollment can be done fully or partially automatic when disability claims are filed (it is often one process in Veteran’s point of view).
