Okay, thank you.

[Jessica] 09:02:39
Awesome. Thank you, Caitlin. And the further observer shows up soon, I'll let her in if not, we'll just move along.

[Jessica] 09:02:48
Okay, so I want to ask are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

[P18] 09:02:54
Yes, that's fine.

[Jessica] 09:02:55

[Jessica] 09:03:03
This recording is our destroyed after the analysis. And none of your comments will be attributed to you. Report things out in groups like 5 out of 10.

[Jessica] 09:03:11
Or if we do use a quote from you directly, we give you our participant ID like P. So kind of knowing all that background, are you still comfortable if we record screen and audio today?

[P18] 09:03:21
Yes, that's me.

[Jessica] 09:03:23
Okay. I am going to get that started. And then I'll confirm once I start on the recording.

[P18] 09:03:31
Okay.

[Jessica] 09:03:34
Okay, I have started the recording, so just to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today.

[P18] 09:03:41
Yes, I am.

[Jessica] 09:03:43
Okay, thank you. Okay, gonna start with a couple warm-up questions here. When was your last appointment at a VA facility when you were seen for medical reasons.

[P18] 09:03:54
Even at a clinic.

[P18] 09:03:59
That would be probably.

[P18] 09:04:03
Maybe 2 months ago.

[Jessica] 09:04:05
Okay. And are you currently enrolled in VA healthcare?

[P18] 09:04:10
Yes. Yes.

[Jessica] 09:04:12
Got it. Okay, can you explain to me in your own words the process you took when you applied for benefits?

[Jessica] 09:04:22
For health care benefits, that is.

[P18] 09:04:25
I was kind of enrolled because,

[P18] 09:04:30
I had I had gotten cancer while overseas. And so it was kind of. They kind of took care of me.

[P18] 09:04:43
While I was still in the military. And then I was exiting out of the military and I was still having issues with the cancer.

[P18] 09:04:54
So they kept me on and then it kinda like They just kind of moved me over. If that makes sense, like.

[P18] 09:05:05
So I was I was already being seen for for some for cancer. And you know cancer they want to keep checking up with you after you know you've sort of gone into a mission.

[P18] 09:05:19
And so. I was still being seen. During, you know, right after I exited the military.

[P18] 09:05:29
So I'm not really sure. I believe it was probably a. Nurse advocate who, enrolled me.

[Jessica] 09:05:39
Sorry to hear that. Thank you for sharing. So about how many years ago was this?

[P18] 09:05:48
It's been going on since, 2,012 was when I exited the military.

[Jessica] 09:05:56
Okay.

[P18] 09:05:56
And then I've had complications from the cancer. And that's why I'm still being seen by the VA.

[Jessica] 09:06:05
Okay.

[P18] 09:06:06
But as far as, like compensation goes, I did have to. Fight for that because you know they weren't connecting the cancer with my other complications like heart disease that arise from the.

[P18] 09:06:23
From the chemotherapy and radiation. So I did have to go to, I forget what those.

[P18] 09:06:33
Services are called but it was ultimately DAV, disabled, veterans association.

[P18] 09:06:42
That got me the compensation.

[P18] 09:06:49
Through the

[Jessica] 09:06:49
You'd mentioned, oh, okay, sorry. I need to interrupt you there.

[P18] 09:06:53
Yeah, so I was just trying to add some. So that you knew it was connected to the VA.

[P18] 09:06:58
In some way.

[Jessica] 09:07:00
Got it. And you mentioned the liaison kind of helped you get signed up and enrolled.

[Jessica] 09:07:06
I believe it was the word you used. Do you remember if this was did she just ask you questions?

[Jessica] 09:07:12
Was there a paper form involved at all or online?

[P18] 09:07:17
I'm sure they ask me questions. I don't remember filling out paperwork, but I probably did.

[P18] 09:07:28
But it wasn't like. I went to the.

[P18] 09:07:34
I know there was a desk at my, in the Long Beach VA. That I could have gone to and I think I did go to to get my ID card.

[P18] 09:07:47
So I do remember that area of the VA hospital. Being there for me if I did need it.

[Jessica] 09:07:58
Thanks for sharing that as you're kind of recollecting back those few years. Was there any part of the process that stood out as being frustrating or difficult for you.

[P18] 09:08:10
No, I really don't. Pretty they've been everyone involved was very helpful and getting me my care.

[Jessica] 09:08:22
Glad to hear that. Was your kind of memory about the amount of information you had to provide for getting health care benefits?

[P18] 09:08:35
I do know they, you know, after I was in remission for a while they They send me to, back up to Seattle, which is where I had been stationed.

[P18] 09:08:49
To get reevaluated, by a doctor and He was asking me All sorts of questions like quality of life and.

[P18] 09:09:00
And all that and you know at the time I had been feeling good so I you know, responded as such.

[P18] 09:09:08
And, so they kinda were like, okay, you're all done. Then we can kick you off and I had to write a letter.

[P18] 09:09:20
To. You know, saying that, cause especially I think with the heart. I was gonna be on need medication for life and they were trying to reduce my compensation down to like.

[P18] 09:09:35
I think just below where. Where my meds would have been covered. Completely. So I would have had to.

[P18] 09:09:43
You know, been paying all this time for medication. So I did have to appeal that in writing.

[P18] 09:09:52
And they bumped me up to just above where my medication would be covered. And that part was kind of frustrating because.

[P18] 09:10:04
Yeah, I didn't know that I was gonna have the heart issue. And I kind of took that on my on myself.

[P18] 09:10:14
So. Yeah, I'd been enjoy that. I wish there could have been an easier way to.

[P18] 09:10:22
To have my situation reevaluated by a doctor. After the fact.

[Jessica] 09:10:32
Great feedback. Thanks for sharing that. And you had mentioned being bumped up. Can you tell me a little bit more about that?

[P18] 09:10:39
Yeah, they bumped up the percent because they go by a percentage of your disability like. I believe I had some slight hearing loss.

[P18] 09:10:49
That was like 10%. The, chemo treatment also caused some in fertility.

[P18] 09:10:58
So. They did that like, I don't know, 5% or something. And And then.

[P18] 09:11:06
So. Like I said, since the cancer had been in remission. They, dropped that part, which was a big chunk of the percentage.

[P18] 09:11:19
So.

[P18] 09:11:22
Yeah, like, I think I think the percentage for medication coverage was like 70% disability and then

[P18] 09:11:36
So just before that, I think they had dropped me down to like, 60% and then. It went up to like 70 75%.

[P18] 09:11:45
Something just to get my medication covered. And you know, that was fine. Cause I was working, but my health was declining because of the heart issues.

[P18] 09:11:56
So eventually I went to the DAV. To get. 100% disability.

[Jessica] 09:12:06
Thank you for clarifying that for me.

[Jessica] 09:12:11
When it comes to registering in health care at the VA, what does that mean to you?

[P18] 09:12:19
Just filing an application. I assume it would mean. Getting checked up after filing the application.

[P18] 09:12:28
You know, having your medical records from the military. I remember that was kind of an issue too, you know, having to get.

[P18] 09:12:38
I think printouts. From, my original station in Seattle. And having to have them transferred.

[P18] 09:12:48
I think I've brought in manually even to Long Beach.

[P18] 09:12:53
So just a lot of a lot of paperwork. That's what it means to me.

[Jessica] 09:13:00
Got it. Thank you for that. Kind of switching gears a little bit and kind of talk about Kind of as you were enrolling and understanding healthcare benefits and understanding your eligibility I know you mentioned a liaison kind of helped you through that, but how else did you determine what health benefits you could get and when you completed the application or as you've gone through using healthcare.

[P18] 09:13:27
I mean, they, they really kind of just, they really do guide you. I mean the doctors anyways and there's always I know I spent so much time in the hospital.

[P18] 09:13:40
I feel like I just, you know, would walk to whatever department I needed to. You know, even if it took all day, I would have to go and.

[P18] 09:13:51
To understand my benefits. I would. Go to these different departments like the.

[P18] 09:13:57
The registration desk. I do the desk where they give you the ID card. So I, I would go there, I would try and find out who handles this, cause I have no idea, you know, about, patient advocates and, and whatnot.

[P18] 09:14:15
So I did have to go sometimes back and forth and and try and find out and ask the doctor like, okay, how much is this going to be?

[P18] 09:14:26
And But I'm not sure how they know they seem to know that you know if you're a hundred percent that Everything's covered.

[P18] 09:14:37
Cause, yeah, I do remember asking like, okay, so What am I gonna do? I'm out of a job.

[P18] 09:14:47
I don't have anything and they're like don't worry it's all covered you were You are.

[P18] 09:14:54
Service connected because it was it happened while I was overseas in Iraq. So they seem to know. When you are service connected.

[P18] 09:15:05
That, you don't have to worry about anything. So. That greatly put my mind at ease.

[Jessica] 09:15:14
Got it. Thank you for explaining that. So it sounds like the resources you use to understand what you might qualify for.

[Jessica] 09:15:21
You've leaned heavily on doctors and in person at facilities. To navigate this. Is there any other resources or changes to that that you would find helpful?

[P18] 09:15:25
Yes. Correct.

[P18] 09:15:35
I mean, of course online is always helpful and I've made more than my share of phone calls to get information about benefits.

[P18] 09:15:46
Even educational benefits. But, yeah, I was so close to the, I mean, not really close, but I was with in driving distance to the hospital.

[P18] 09:15:59
So. If ever I did have a question, I usually went there. Because that's the, you know, rather than being on hold for who knows how long, sometimes an hour or more.

[P18] 09:16:15
It's, sometimes either just to go in person. Find out, try and get some answers.

[Jessica] 09:16:25
That makes sense. See where was I? I know you mentioned a few health concerns you had when you first were enrolled and getting help with that.

[Jessica] 09:16:34
Were you interested in enrolling for full health care coverage or just care for those specific concerns?

[P18] 09:16:43
Just care for my specific concerns. Yeah, I had planned, I was going back to school and everything and just health issues just kept arising that made it impossible for me to.

[P18] 09:17:00
Manage even today to have a full time job. Where I can't you know leave in case, you know, I forget my medication or something so yeah, at the time I was just looking to.

[P18] 09:17:18
Get better and healthy and be able to have have my own health care. Private health care because You know, people usually say it's better to have private healthcare.

[Jessica] 09:17:31
Here, can you talk about that a little bit more?

[P18] 09:17:36
Yeah, I mean, For instance, I had to have a surgery and immediate surgery and it was emergency surgery, so they took me to like a Cedar Sinai.

[P18] 09:17:48
And, I received excellent care and surgery. Great success and I was out of there. Like amazingly very quick.

[P18] 09:18:00
And then the second time I have to add it has this procedure. They were ready for it, so I had it at a .

[P18] 09:18:10
Slash They work with a university, so it was a university hospital. And I feel like those are like teaching hospitals so they You know, they're practicing on live patients and.

[P18] 09:18:25
You know, they don't, it doesn't always go so smoothly. At least they didn't for me.

[P18] 09:18:31
So the second time I had the surgery like There was all kinds of complications and I was stuck in the hospital for, you know, a greater period of time.

[P18] 09:18:42
After the surgery. And yeah, they were. They were doing all. All kinds of things that we're not making me feel good.

[P18] 09:18:53
Is like.

[P18] 09:18:55
Just as far as like eating and. And. The aftercare was it seemed.

[P18] 09:19:05
Less less so. I don't know how to describe it, but it was. It's, yeah.

[P18] 09:19:14
There. Yeah. Is a little traumatic to say the least.

[Jessica] 09:19:14
Okay. Yeah, sorry. Sorry to hear that. Thank you for sharing.

[P18] 09:19:21
Yeah.

[Jessica] 09:19:24
Looking back now that you've been using your healthcare benefits, is there anything you wish you knew who would have known?

[Jessica] 09:19:31
During the application earlier earlier on in the process to

[P18] 09:19:37
Yeah

[P18] 09:19:41
I mean, yeah, those little things about knowing where to go, the right person to talk to.

[P18] 09:19:52
You know, cause, initially. When I was trying to get my full disability at Hi, I didn't know about these, service organizations like the DAV or, I forget what the other names of the.

[P18] 09:20:08
The, patient advocates are, but, Yeah, just knowing that there was someone there that could.

[P18] 09:20:17
Could kinda guide you through the application process or the appeal process. Cause yeah, you, you don't know what to do.

[P18] 09:20:28
You get these papers in the mail that say, here. Your claim has been denied or something and you're like, okay, what's What do I do now?

[P18] 09:20:39
I'm. I don't know what to do. And And that's when you have to.

[P18] 09:20:46
You know, just kinda be a detective and. Go to the hospital and Ask questions. And you know, at first you don't even know what questions to ask.

[P18] 09:20:59
Like. Why are they denying this?

[P18] 09:21:04
Stuff like that and

[Jessica] 09:21:07
Thanks for sharing. Sounds like quite the process.

[P18] 09:21:11
Is this? Yeah.

[Jessica] 09:21:14
Can you explain to me in your own words, please, what you get with VA health care benefits?

[Jessica] 09:21:20
What does that mean to you in your own words? Yeah

[P18] 09:21:23
Just a peace of mind that. If something really goes wrong with my health. I don't feel like I'm gonna go bankrupt or lose my house.

[P18] 09:21:38
So that it is. It's a big weight off my shoulder. Because I know how expensive healthcare is in this country, so it's just.

[P18] 09:21:49
Hey, really is a big Big burden off of me not to have to think about that. You know, I do have some.

[P18] 09:22:00
Some. Somebody to go to if my health declines.

[Jessica] 09:22:09
Thanks for sharing that. See, moving on here. What I know you mentioned a lot of in person resources going to the facility tracking people down It sounds like it was all kind of on foot in person?

[Jessica] 09:22:25
Did you? Ever do any of this online to try and figure things out or just kind of rely on that.

[Jessica] 09:22:30
Face to face interaction.

[P18] 09:22:32
The only things I did online were, be able to download forms that I needed like for the appeal form.

[P18] 09:22:43
Yeah, I didn't really know, you know, just like. Just like the hospital.

[P18] 09:22:49
I would maybe type in queries about, you know, how to do something, but I didn't see the VA website as like a place to go to, to find out this information about what my options were or how to how to go about.

[P18] 09:23:10
Doing things. Or who to talk to, cause yeah, I'm sure they're. Even though they do have the service organizations in the hospital, so I can't imagine they're trying to hide them online but it's not like They, give you a link to those organizations or anything that might have been helpful.

[Jessica] 09:23:34
So it's really the veteran service organizations. You relied heavily on that for the whole process.

[Jessica] 09:23:42
Okay. Can you tell me what more about what priority group you're in for health care benefits for VA health care benefits now.

[P18] 09:23:52
I believe I'm in the highest priority because it was service. It happened overseas in Iraq in a war zone.

[P18] 09:24:02
So I believe it is. The highest priority.

[Jessica] 09:24:07
Okay. Can you describe if you've seen this like was this communicated to? Any point from the VA or how you understood the impact to your benefits based on that priority?

[P18] 09:24:21
I believe they send me a letter. Or a packet. When my My rating was was finally a hundred percent.

[P18] 09:24:34
And it kinda gave me some info. But I don't remember it specifically being like, oh,

[P18] 09:24:42
You have unlimited health care visits or anything, even though I know that to be true. It's, it's not like they were like, oh, you're all your meds are free or anything.

[P18] 09:24:54
I just. I same to just remember them saying you have access to via healthcare You have a hundred percent access to via healthcare and medications.

[Jessica] 09:25:10
Got it. I guess before, you enroll, sound like you enrolled like right after discharge, however, but were you aware of priority groups and copays and how that worked with VA healthcare?

[P18] 09:25:23
No, no, I wasn't aware until they you know, dropped my rating down. After they reevaluated me.

[Jessica] 09:25:23
Before you used it?

[P18] 09:25:35
So that's why I was like, oh no, what did I do? Like, you know, I was feeling good at the time, but of course I still needed my medication and.

[P18] 09:25:45
And I didn't, you know, I didn't wanna go in there. At into the reevaluation like.

[P18] 09:25:53
Having to put on an act or something. So. I wasn't aware of the. What the doctor was trying to do at the time.

[P18] 09:26:04
So I felt like. I don't know, I felt like he was kind of.

[P18] 09:26:10
You know. Almost trekking me into being like, oh, you're okay. You're fine now.

[P18] 09:26:17
You don't need, you don't need any more help.

[P18] 09:26:20
I don't know. That was just the doctor. Or how the normally operates.

[P18] 09:26:28
But, yeah.

[Jessica] 09:26:33
Yeah, sounds difficult for sure. I guess now that you've been using your healthcare benefits and kind of where priority groups How would you like get to kind of impact the health care application when you were filling that or when you were enrolling.

[P18] 09:26:51
Hmm Okay.

[Jessica] 09:26:52
Is there anything you would have found helpful to know up front?

[P18] 09:26:57
Now that is difficult because I mean, you know, you don't want people to game the system, but at the same time, you don't want them to cheat themselves out of.

[P18] 09:27:07
Any benefits that they've earned.

[P18] 09:27:13
I, I would probably want the doctor to rely less on like. The patient interview and more on like test results and You know, or what the possible.

[P18] 09:27:27
You know, if you do have these symptoms, hey. You should tell us about them or.

[P18] 09:27:35
Or You know, because when you're especially me when I'm in an interview process, sometimes I'm just I'm trying to be present in the moment.

[P18] 09:27:46
I'm not thinking back to a specific incident. Where you know, oh this could be trouble later down the line like you know I was hospitalized one time for being dehydrated and I I just took it on myself that, you know, oh, I need to do a better job of hydrating myself.

[P18] 09:28:05
But it could have been the heart issue, so. Yeah, that's, that's a tough one to answer.

[P18] 09:28:14
I'm not sure what the solution is.

[Jessica] 09:28:19
Okay, no, I, wrong answer here just looking for honest feedback.

[P18] 09:28:24
Okay.

[Jessica] 09:28:25
Gonna kind of shift gears now a little bit and talk about kind of an ideal state so If I had a perfect world, magic wand, how would you like the health care application process to go in regards to learning about what benefit options and what you qualify for.

[Jessica] 09:28:43
If you could have it your way, how would you like? Healthcare application to go.

[P18] 09:28:55
And. Definitely online, especially now that I live farther away from my closest VA facility.

[P18] 09:29:09
Maybe teleconference. Or a Zoom Meeting like we're doing. You know, maybe not just with a doctor, but also with a patient advocate.

[P18] 09:29:28
Hmm

[P18] 09:29:31
Try and go.

[Jessica] 09:29:39
That's great feedback so far. I guess kind of prompting this 30 Like you mentioned Zoom Meeting and that patient advocate.

[Jessica] 09:29:47
Is there any other tools or communication? Or other people that would make this process.

[P18] 09:30:00
Yeah, I can't think of anything more than, you know, just moving it. Outside of the V.

[P18] 09:30:08
Because yeah, I don't know how I would have done it now being you know, like an hour away from my an hour or more away from my local VA.

[P18] 09:30:19
I don't think I would have been able to do the footwork that I did back then.

[P18] 09:30:24
So yeah, just. Just moving it off, I mean, online and And, but I mean, certain things you're gonna need, like I said, that more testing.

[P18] 09:30:37
Then, then it just strictly interview. Evaluate you know more more than just a blood test because I believe they gave me maybe a blood test at the time.

[P18] 09:30:50
But it seemed like it was mainly. Due to the interview that they decided my rating.

[Jessica] 09:30:57
Okay. And for understanding healthcare benefits, would you want the same? Kind of online video.

[P18] 09:31:07
Yeah, yeah, a video could work. If you have a patient advocate recording a video explaining to you, you know, what the process is.

[Jessica] 09:31:08
Interaction.

[P18] 09:31:19
And then also maybe even a video from the doctor explaining what the process is. I think those things would help you prepare.

[P18] 09:31:29
A little better for your. For the actual interview like if you actually talk to the doctor plus the video, you know.

[P18] 09:31:38
So, about things.

[Jessica] 09:31:42
Got it. Is there any specific information in this process that would be important to you? So you feel confident when choosing healthcare options.

[P18] 09:31:59
Oh, confident.

[P18] 09:32:09
Thank God.

[P18] 09:32:12
You know, cause like I said before, it I know the VA gets a bad rap.

[P18] 09:32:19
It's just hard because you, you know, you find good doctors in the VA, but then it.

[P18] 09:32:24
It seems like they leave.

[P18] 09:32:28
Just. I guess just knowing that, you know. Got the VA is more should be more of a safety net, you know, if you can.

[P18] 09:32:39
We recommend I would recommend anyone trying to get private insurance.

[P18] 09:32:46
You know, would they? The DA does its best, but. I feel more like it's a safety net and that you know it would help people to know that.

[P18] 09:32:58
That you know they can rely on the BA, the VA will always be there for them but There are other options out there.

[P18] 09:33:07
There are private healthcare options out there that. Sometimes spend more, but also cost more money. So just yeah being upfront with them.

[P18] 09:33:19
Knowing that they have other options.

[Jessica] 09:33:19
Okay.

[Jessica] 09:33:24
Thank you for that feedback. We're gonna shift gears again to another topic. This will be our final topic for today.

[Jessica] 09:33:32
So I'm going to share my screen with you and show some examples of some instructions that appear on a health care benefit application.

[Jessica] 09:33:41
And just ask you to explain in your own words. Let's see, so let me give me a second.

[Jessica] 09:33:53
I heard it. Okay.

[Jessica] 09:33:58
Can you see the instructions okay or do you need me to zoom in at all?

[Jessica] 09:34:06
Do you see it okay? Okay, so yeah, if you could take a minute to just look this over and please remember to just think aloud and explain to me in your own words what these options mean.

[P18] 09:34:07
Yes, yes I can.

[Jessica] 09:34:18
To you and how they're different.

[P18] 09:34:21
Yeah, I see. This does seem very, familiar like with the paperwork I've received in the past.

[P18] 09:34:30
And the thing I would recommend especially is taking out like all the 38 CFR, 17.3 6.

[P18] 09:34:40
You don't wanna take them out completely because people need that. I think to like look up, you know, online, see what these things are.

[P18] 09:34:50
But when you are trying to read Through it, it kind of. It gets a little muddled with these things.

[P18] 09:35:02
So that would be my recommendation for that. Let me read this through it here.

[P18] 09:35:12
Okay. 2.

[P18] 09:35:24
Yeah, and, another thing I never liked about these, you know, putting it all at the top and then giving the sections.

[P18] 09:35:35
Like I feel like it would be better if you had Just a little blurb of Okay, for this section, do this instead of sections 1, 2, 3, complete everything.

[P18] 09:35:49
Because I know that's tripped me up sometimes where I filled out the wrong section because I would have to go back up to these.

[P18] 09:36:01
But the bullet points are good. Well, the points are always good.

[P18] 09:36:07
Even under the main bullet points. Those bullet points as well. Referring to specifically.

[Jessica] 09:36:18
That's great feedback. Thank you. Which one of these would you select if you were completing a health care application today?

[Jessica] 09:36:26
What can you tell me your thinking behind that?

[P18] 09:36:32
Yeah, I mean, I'd start with enrollment because If they don't even have you enrolled, I don't know how you would.

[P18] 09:36:40
Register for anything.

[P18] 09:36:48
So yeah, enrollment.

[Jessica] 09:36:52
Got it. Thank you. Can you explain a little bit more about the which you mentioned before you'd enroll first because you couldn't register for anything.

[Jessica] 09:37:01
Just kind of explain your thinking behind that.

[P18] 09:37:04
Cause I feel like enrollment is is the start of anything and then, you know, just so they get you in the system.

[P18] 09:37:14
As far as they know who you are and hopefully they can

[P18] 09:37:20
They know your your. Military record that's that's the thing I would never clear on.

[P18] 09:37:30
You know, because While I was in the, even exiting the military, they still kept me on.

[P18] 09:37:38
The military's role. For a while after I had exited the military. And then there was a period of time where they they transferred me over to the Va's role.

[P18] 09:37:51
And that's where like it was confusing. I didn't I didn't know what they were doing.

[P18] 09:37:58
No one I kind of explained it to me. They just said one day. I was on the military role and then the next day I was on the PA's role.

[P18] 09:38:09
But yeah, I always. Hey, feel like enrollment is the start of everything. You know, you enroll for your you know, there's a period of time where you can enroll into a a health care plan at a job, the enrollment period.

[P18] 09:38:28
And then. I would imagine for any other benefits or you know.

[P18] 09:38:36
For anything. You're trying to get on top of. Being enrolled you want to register for it but yeah, I do see it says enrollment not required to register for benefits.

[P18] 09:38:52
Which, you know, I'm not sure if. If that makes it easier, you know, because then they still have to.

[P18] 09:39:00
To put you in the system, but you have to be put into the system. So that the different departments can talk to one another.

[P18] 09:39:13
But, yeah, I do see on the form it says enrollment not required.

[P18] 09:39:21
So that's a little confusing to me. The enrollments not required.

[Jessica] 09:39:30
Thanks for that feedback. That's very helpful for us. So kind of. The topic of confusing things.

[Jessica] 09:39:40
You've mentioned that enrollment not required seems a little unclear. Is there anything I know you also mentioned the numbers is there anything else here?

[Jessica] 09:39:49
That you would like extra clarity. If you were reading this on your own or completing this form on your own.

[P18] 09:39:57
Let me move your box down a little bit. Yes. So it says, Let me see.

[Jessica] 09:40:00
And if I need to adjust, just let me know.

[P18] 09:40:15
Yeah, I mean like I said before with the 38 CFR like It would probably be helpful to just say.

[P18] 09:40:23
Veterans requesting an eligibility assessment clinical evaluation or care treatment. Pursuant They should do this. They should go here.

[P18] 09:40:35
They should. Call this number. You know. Better than having to look up 38 CFR 17 dot 37.

[Jessica] 09:40:51
Got it. Anything else you want to add before we move on?

[P18] 09:40:51
Yeah.

[P18] 09:41:01
No, that seems to be about it for that.

[Jessica] 09:41:04
Okay. Oh, just think back. We were talking about ideal state. You had mentioned kind of a video walkthrough or some other examples that you were mentioning there.

[Jessica] 09:41:15
Now that you've seen this example, Is there anything you would adjust or change to your ideal state?

[P18] 09:41:24
No, I still feel there's a lot of people who. Who don't even have the patience to read through all this.

[P18] 09:41:34
Even though it's a short little blurb and you have bullet points and everything. Some people just do better with the visual video somebody talking to them.

[P18] 09:41:46
Somebody telling them and instead of reading it for themselves. Cause I mean, I myself have. Mild dyslexia where I sometimes confuse numbers, especially.

[P18] 09:42:01
Reading them backwards or, or, you know, putting them out of place. So yeah, I still feel like some kind of.

[P18] 09:42:09
Video or even an audio explanation. Good help somebody. With even greater, reading disability or comprehension disability.

[Jessica] 09:42:25
That's great feedback. Thank you for sharing that. Find my stop share button. Okay, well that is basically what we What I wanted to chat with you about today.

[Jessica] 09:42:36
So before we kind of wrap up, is there anything else you would like to add about anything that we talked about today?

[P18] 09:42:44
I think. No, I think. Covered a lot.

[Jessica] 09:42:52
We did. Thank you very much. And do you have any questions for me?

[P18] 09:42:57
Yeah, this has been very good. I'm glad somebody is working on it.

[Jessica] 09:43:02
Yes. Yeah, we're trying to iterate and improve as much as we can, but we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today kind of this honest opinion and sharing from veterans like you is what helps us iterate and improve.

[Jessica] 09:43:16
So thank you. Your feedback is very helpful as we continue to work in truth towards making the site better for veterans.

[P18] 09:43:23
Good pleasure.

[Jessica] 09:43:24
Yeah. And lastly, Perry Gian will be sending you a little thank you note.

[Jessica] 09:43:29
They're the ones that recruited you and set all this up. And you can pass that along to other veterans so that they could also participate in future research with us.

[P18] 09:43:36
Alright, great. Thank you.

[Jessica] 09:43:36
So.

[Jessica] 09:43:38
Awesome, thank you very much and enjoy the rest of your day. Have a great day.

[P18] 09:43:41
You too. Bye bye.
