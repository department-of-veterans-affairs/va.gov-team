[Jessica] 09:05:56
My name is Jessica and I have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes, but.

[Jessica] 09:06:03
Before we get to them, kind of want to go over what we're going to chat about today.

[Jessica] 09:06:08
So. Today? Yeah.

[P11] 09:06:08
Yeah, because I'm used a little bit. I know I signed up for something, but I can't.

[P11] 09:06:14
Remember what because I volunteer for a lot of studies and stuff trying to get some stem cell therapy so I don't know so We'll go from there.

[Jessica] 09:06:22
Wow. Okay, well, today we're going to talk about the online health care application for VA health care benefits.

[Jessica] 09:06:31
And kind of understanding your health care benefit options. That's kind of what we're going to focus on.

[P11] 09:06:34
Well.

[Jessica] 09:06:38
We're gonna ask some questions. And so before we start, a few things I want to mention.

[Jessica] 09:06:41
This entire session shouldn't take more than an hour and I want to make sure not to keep you much longer and be respectful of your time.

[Jessica] 09:06:47
So I'll kind of make sure if we. Go to down on one topic. I'll kind of prompt us to the next one.

[Jessica] 09:06:53
Also, this is in this session we want to hear your honest opinions. We really want to improve these tools to meet veterans needs.

[Jessica] 09:07:00
So the more you can kind of share with us, it'll be really helpful and will not be offended by any opinions you express and we welcome all of the feedback you're willing to share.

[P11] 09:07:10
Okay.

[Jessica] 09:07:11
Okay, if any reason during this session at any time you want to stop just let me know you'll be compensated no matter how much we complete no questions asked.

[P11] 09:07:21
Okay.

[Jessica] 09:07:21
So. Now back to those observers I had mentioned. Perry Gian did ask for your consent to allow observers during the signup process, but I just want to make sure that that's still okay today.

[Jessica] 09:07:33
So. Are you okay with a couple additional observers today?

[P11] 09:07:36
Yeah, are they students or something?

[Jessica] 09:07:40
They're just working on the team that's one of the many teams working on VA. Gov.

[Jessica] 09:07:45
So.

[P11] 09:07:45
Okay.

[Jessica] 09:07:46
I will admit them into the Zoom room now.

[Jessica] 09:07:54
And then as they get all signed in, I'll ask them if they could. Turn on their cameras and just do a brief introduction.

[Hieu Vo] 09:08:06
Hi, I'm Hugh. I am a US. Designer and researcher.

[Hieu Vo] 09:08:11
I work with Jessica on the health care application and for the VA. Thank you for joining us.

[P11] 09:08:20
Nice to meet you.

[Jessica] 09:08:27
Emily?

[Emily Brown] 09:08:32
Sorry, I'm having some technical stuff this morning, but hello, I'm Emily. I also work with Jessica on the health enrollment team.

[Emily Brown] 09:08:37
So super excited to be here and thank you very much.

[P11] 09:08:41
Thanks.

[Jessica] 09:08:44
Awesome, thank you observers. Okay, so one more question. Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today.

[P11] 09:08:52
Sure, go ahead.

[Jessica] 09:08:54
Okay, and just so you know too the recordings we just used to confirm we've captured your opinions accurately and our notes are accurate and then the recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis.

[Jessica] 09:09:05
None of your comments will be attributed to you directly. Everything's anonymized. So report findings out in groups like 5 out of 10 we talked to said this.

[Jessica] 09:09:13
Or if we quote you directly, we take away identifying information and give you a participant ID like p 7 or something.

[Jessica] 09:09:20
So now that I've explained all that, are you still comfortable if we record? Screen and audio as we talk today?

[P11] 09:09:26
Sure

[Jessica] 09:09:28
Okay, I'm gonna get that started and then once it starts I'll confirm again.

[Jessica] 09:09:35
Okay, I have started the recording, so just as I said, I'd like to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today.

[P11] 09:09:42
Yes.

[Jessica] 09:09:44
Okay, thank you. Dive back in. So a couple warm-up questions to get us started.

[Jessica] 09:09:51
When was your last appointment at a VA facility when you were seen for medical reasons?

[P11] 09:10:04
Shoot last

[P11] 09:10:09
Last week

[P11] 09:10:12
No, probably it was a week before that I was at a

[P11] 09:10:21
Chiropractor session that had chiropractor. Session about. 3 weeks ago.

[P11] 09:10:30
What was the last time I was there?

[Jessica] 09:10:33
Got it. And are you currently enrolled for VA healthcare today?

[P11] 09:10:37
Yes, I am I have an appointment there today at 1,400 for physical therapy

[Jessica] 09:10:46
Awesome. Okay. Kind of. Switching gears a little bit.

[Jessica] 09:10:51
Can you explain to me in your own words then the process you took when you applied for those health care benefits?

[P11] 09:11:00
I don't mean with you, I don't understand what you mean by process.

[Jessica] 09:11:05
When you were applying for VA healthcare, did you Do it in person? Were you online? Did you do it at the VA facility with help?

[P11] 09:11:17
As far as becoming a patient with V. Do you mean that? How do I get enrolled in VA?

[Jessica] 09:11:23
Yeah.

[P11] 09:11:24
That was part of my retirement process. When I retired, I had issues, medical issues, so they sent me to VA for some final analysis and whatever final test and stuff and While I was there, I went there, signed up.

[P11] 09:11:45
I think I got like, 50 or 60%. Disability so I automatically signed up there. And while I was working with a private company.

[P11] 09:12:00
I use VA primarily for all my medical care because I just felt more comfortable with people that dealt with soldiers.

[P11] 09:12:11
And that's how it did it. Majority of it was there at the VA at the sign up for enroll in that get to ID card and all of that.

[P11] 09:12:21
So yeah, majority of that was done. Through VA in person.

[Jessica] 09:12:25
Thank you for explaining the detail. Did you have someone kind of explaining your been the process to you or was there anything about that that was frustrating?

[P11] 09:12:40
It wasn't frustrating in the beginning in a sense. It wasn't frustrating. A lot of things that are offered to veterans.

[P11] 09:12:52
Or not explained in full. I had a situation just recently that's why I'm now the situation I'm in.

[P11] 09:13:03
I'm I'm temporary on medical leave. I fell and broke my hip. Went to a community care source outside of VA, has surgery.

[P11] 09:13:19
But nobody was there to guide me. It would be great if they had like a liaison person that someone could call, explain the benefits.

[P11] 09:13:33
I had no idea that I always, privy to transportation to appointments and things. I had no idea about.

[P11] 09:13:43
Signing my wife up as my care provider. I actually lost my relationship with her because of my injury because she couldn't afford to take all the days off to take me to appointments.

[P11] 09:14:01
And I use my son and then I found out that, oh, yeah, you, you can get somebody to take you to your appointments.

[P11] 09:14:08
A lot of stuff I wasn't aware of. I didn't know that I had access to certain benefits and things of that nature.

[P11] 09:14:18
It's like there's no one there to Walk you through it's not for me per se.

[P11] 09:14:25
But the older veterans and it sads me to see, you know, like some Vietnam veterans and stuff that man they they're totally lost because we're not on this.

[P11] 09:14:36
Modern day technology so we me myself I'll say me I'm more or less more like to deal with people person to person.

[P11] 09:14:47
You can't do that anymore. You can't talk directly to a person every time you call a number you're getting answer machine or You get put on hold and sometimes I sat and wait on hold for over an hour and nobody answers and you leave a message nobody Contacts you understand we're in the busy world and things with And at 1 point I left VA.

[P11] 09:15:12
Cause I got so upset. With VA, changing my doctor every 3 years or so I'm getting a new provider so as usual you have to sit down and tell your story over and over again I got tired of telling my story why I hear what am I going through how I'm filling all of this.

[P11] 09:15:34
So, I left, you know, and I started using my company's, medical insurance, you know.

[P11] 09:15:44
So then I figured that with the iraq and You know. Conflict that was going on that you know I started hearing about how they taken care of soldiers better better better yeah but I figured that out now if you wasn't in that conflict you don't really fall under that umbrella of care.

[P11] 09:16:07
So it's still like we're still like, you know, pushed to the side. If I was a part of the wounded warrior and I served in Iraq or Afghanistan.

[P11] 09:16:16
I would be afforded the any care I requested or wanted. I would get it with no problem asked but it seems like me I still Following this umbrella I mean, I can't help it that I didn't have to go serve in a campaign.

[P11] 09:16:32
I was willing to. Don't ask, don't get me wrong, I still was willing to.

[P11] 09:16:38
Give my life to this country, but because I did and it stills still like I fall under certain criteria that I don't meet so if I was a wounded warrior like I'm going through therapy now and I'm like, hey, it would be great if I could do pool therapy as part of my therapy.

[P11] 09:16:56
Well, we don't have pool therapy. You can't do pool therapy while you're participating in physical therapy and I'm like why not to me that's like extra therapy extra work that gets me back on my feet faster I'm doing but The way they have set up, I can't do it.

[P11] 09:17:13
So. I'm disappointed. In the VA health care system. I understand we're understaffed.

[P11] 09:17:23
That's why they kicked a lot of stuff out to community care. But in my opinion, this is just my opinion.

[P11] 09:17:31
Once you give a person a out to relieve the pressure off of them. They'll use it and be saying that is now these people know that, hey, we don't have to flood our office with all these appointments.

[P11] 09:17:46
Let's reaffirm the community care.

[P11] 09:17:50
So you gave them out now, so now everybody's telling you all we're. We're backlog where 3 3 months ahead this and that which may be true it could be true I don't know but

[P11] 09:18:04
I'm going through community care. I finally got into VA for acupuncture. Well, he transferred.

[P11] 09:18:13
He had a death in the family, so he transferred back to the East Coast. So I'm like, well, what are we doing now with the the acting person is like, well, we gonna refer you guys to community care.

[P11] 09:18:23
I'm like, okay. What was the process? Well, your provider has to put in another request for you.

[P11] 09:18:30
And I'm like, wow. In my assessment, the manager for Acupuncture. Should have contacted the manager from community care say, hey man, look, our acupuncture guy is leaving.

[P11] 09:18:43
I'm gonna refer some cases over to you instead of going through the primary care provider sending that stuff to community care.

[P11] 09:18:53
It took me 4 weeks. To get approved for treatment. Where they could at managers could have got together or whatever.

[P11] 09:19:05
I mean, I don't know. I'm saying, I'm gonna send you 10 cases a day.

[P11] 09:19:08
You guys take care of these cases. Give us a day. You guys take care of these cases. Give us some priority. Put it somewhere.

[P11] 09:19:11
Give it some priority. Put it somewhere. So everybody had to wait. And then you have to wait the weeks to get it approved, then you have to call the provider that they find out when they can schedule you in because they like more other.

[P11] 09:19:25
Medical care facilities, their backlog to their overbook. So you might not be able to see them.

[P11] 09:19:31
For 3 or 4 weeks. So here I go now with like 6 to 8 weeks without treatment.

[P11] 09:19:37
When the treatment treatment I'm trying to get back on my feet So that's the stuff I don't like.

[Jessica] 09:19:38
Wow.

[P11] 09:19:45
So I might have rambled on and went out, out of range and stuff. So. But.

[Jessica] 09:19:49
No worries, that sounds like a lot to deal with and very frustrating. Thank you for sharing it with us.

[Jessica] 09:19:55
Me to hear these stories to try and learn and improve. So I guess kind of going on to our next topic.

[Jessica] 09:20:05
When you think back of when you filled out that first application when you're kind of applying for health care.

[Jessica] 09:20:08
What can you what do you have to remember about the amount of information? That you had to provide them.

[Jessica] 09:20:15
Feel about right. Did it feel like a lot?

[P11] 09:20:17
Okay, it seemed like it was pretty basic and like I said, I was kind of It was kind of easier for me to enroll because I had been given like a disability rating of like 60 You know, so it was a little easier for me.

[P11] 09:20:34
I don't know what the typical vaccine may go through, but it was a little easier for me.

[P11] 09:20:39
It was like, hey, you come here, you're gonna be assigned this team. This is going to be your provider, this is your team, this and that.

[P11] 09:20:47
So it seemed pretty simple at the time.

[Jessica] 09:20:48
Thank you for sharing that. When it comes to the term registering and healthcare at the V. What does that mean to you?

[P11] 09:21:03
It means that I have to take a step. That I really shouldn't have to. In my, in my opinion, if I served.

[P11] 09:21:14
And like I said, I don't know the criteria. I don't know the criteria for.

[P11] 09:21:19
Registering for VA. I don't know what it means. I know what I survey like, oh, you know, If you retire, you taken care of for the rest of your life and anything that happens to you, this and that.

[P11] 09:21:39
So ask the mindset I had. When you pass away you know it was an honor for me when it was an honor when I did honor guard to You know, put a veteran to rest for his final, days and you know, we did the salute and presented the family.

[P11] 09:21:56
It was an honor. And then I learned, wow, you know, they really don't pay for none of that stuff.

[P11] 09:22:03
The families in debt, all you really get is a headstone and a flag and the military honors.

[P11] 09:22:10
They don't pay for your burial. They don't take care of you. So that was very disappointing.

[P11] 09:22:17
So to register. To me means that I'm still not. Guaranteed what I thought. I was gonna get So it's like now you lied to me and told me so now I gotta register to see if I'm able to get.

[P11] 09:22:35
The click the care that I may need. That's what it means to me. So. I thought it would all be automatic.

[P11] 09:22:43
And it could well be that way now, but I don't know. I retired in 2,002, so.

[Jessica] 09:22:49
Great feedback to hear how much you think it should work.

[P11] 09:22:55
Good, you would think so. I don't know. That's just my

[Jessica] 09:22:57
Yeah.

[Jessica] 09:23:01
Yep, please continue to share your opinion, all of it. So kind of going back to kind of as you were understanding your eligibility it sounds like a lot of it's kind of been through the process you've learned what you're eligible through trial and error and actually happening to you but Did anything help you determine?

[P11] 09:23:05
Okay.

[Jessica] 09:23:21
Your health care benefits when you were completing the application? And he said, no, one was there to help you, but.

[P11] 09:23:25
Wow there was no one there to help me. There was no one to take you through the process.

[P11] 09:23:33
I went to a couple of like seminars to understand what you need to do. Like the new resumes.

[P11] 09:23:43
Now that are scanned by computers. They look for key words. So I had to have key words, key elements or types of treatment, you know, I just couldn't say, you know, like I would tell anybody now, man, you just can't keep saying your knee hurt.

[P11] 09:24:00
You have to keep going to your doctor. Even while you're serving, keep going to your doctor until your doctor sends you to a specialist.

[P11] 09:24:07
Once you see that specialist, now you have real document documentation that you have a physical ailment.

[P11] 09:24:14
Now is to find out what that specialist does with that ailment. You know, there's a lot of people get out, they think, well, I got headaches, my shoulder hurt, this, that, this and that, no, that's not it.

[P11] 09:24:26
Just because of saying in your medical records is not gonna give you that the the treatment that you need you know this is something you need to learn early and I learned that they say you need to keep letting them know if you in pain you go you go you go until they send you to a specialist now What does the specialists do?

[P11] 09:24:45
Does the specialist do and then you still have them paying up? You see the specialist. Now you got a physical problem of problem that needs to be addressed.

[P11] 09:24:53
Not that she went on it for sick call a couple times and stuff. So I learned that I learned that You have to be persistent.

[P11] 09:25:04
Yourself to make sure. That's the elements that that are still barbing me today that hurt me to get out of bed and some of them I didn't.

[P11] 09:25:16
Do that. Some of them I did because I had no choice because I ended up having surgery and things of that nature but the other things about That bothered me that I didn't and I put in a claim for I get denied because there's no history.

[P11] 09:25:31
Okay, it was, hey, I'm a soldier, get up, go do your job. Damn, this is what you gotta do.

[P11] 09:25:38
To protect and defend your country. So that's what I did. There was no bitching and crying, moaning and groaning about aches and pains.

[P11] 09:25:49
It's a routine in life. You have them every day. So you don't think to.

[P11] 09:25:53
Go to sitc just cause I'm limping on my hip hurt or my back hurt or whatever you know you don't worry about that stuff you just But then you see how it It goes against you.

[P11] 09:26:07
When as you get older now I'm hurting my back is killing me my knees are killing me

[P11] 09:26:16
But yet still There's nothing that they can do for me because it's not totally covered in my thing.

[P11] 09:26:25
Well, there's things that they can do for me, but. You have to go through a whole different loop and then it seems like, like I said, if you're not on the wounded warrior, if you didn't serve in Iraq and Afghanistan.

[P11] 09:26:39
To me it's like The longer they way to process out they'll wait me out until I'm dead and gone.

[P11] 09:26:47
The name will have to deal with me no more. Then they'll be dealing with the new generation soldiers that they had the Afghanistan Iraq soldiers, the younger generation soldiers.

[P11] 09:26:57
I'm 59 so like people my age probably 50 and over To me, it's like a waiting game.

[P11] 09:27:04
They wait for us to slowly fade away. And disappear and then they continue or the newer, Okay.

[Jessica] 09:27:14
Thank you for sharing that. I know you mentioned a few health concerns when you first enrolled.

[Jessica] 09:27:20
Were you seeking care for only service connected health issues or were you seeking care for her? Full health care coverage.

[P11] 09:27:30
When I first did it was just only for service connected. And then it was things like I knew that if I had this rate that I could get glasses once a year.

[P11] 09:27:41
You know, that was it was basically all service connected. And that was it just to, Just to keep an eye on my physical fitness and stuff.

[P11] 09:27:53
And so I would use it for, physicals. I would basically just go if I need it.

[P11] 09:27:58
I would, that's one thing I use my private insurance for. So I would get 2 physicals a year.

[P11] 09:28:04
Yeah, I will use DA to get a physical, then I will use my, and then I will weigh how they both looked at stuff and what they say, you know, but if I needed any medications or anything, then I would ask VA for, so I know I could get my MASS through VA and everything, so.

[P11] 09:28:22
It, it was, basically, service connected. Some of it now that I'm fully with VA again.

[P11] 09:28:34
Some of it has become, personal issues and things like that.

[Jessica] 09:28:41
Thank you for sharing that. And now kind of now that you've been using your health care benefits and looking back Is there anything that really stands out that you wish you knew during that application?

[P11] 09:29:03
Yeah, just like I said, I wish I was more informed. More informed about and I think they probably doing a better job with it now as soldiers process out of out of the service.

[P11] 09:29:20
They're doing a better job with it now, as soldiers process out of, out of the service.

[P11] 09:29:21
They're doing a better job with it now. They started implementing things when I was transitioning out, they were doing things, you know, like.

[P11] 09:29:30
Helping people. Prepare resumes and stuff like that. I think I went to like a week long class or it was all they all they talked about was transitioning out where now I think they doing that stuff at like 6 months out.

[P11] 09:29:47
They give me like a whole 6 month transition period to get out of the military. I think my son even said they got guys that's working at his job and they're actually getting ready to exit the military but they're already working.

[P11] 09:30:01
Different jobs as they get ready to transition. So. That would be the thing that I wish I had was a better understanding of how to transition.

[P11] 09:30:13
Into the civilian sector. Basically it was like hey man thanks for your service and boom see you later you know now you're out there on your own so you're used to this structured life you look used to getting up at You know, 50'clock in the morning, PT, you know, lunch.

[P11] 09:30:34
He knows, close the business and then. You used to destruct your life and now you like, wow, what do I do?

[P11] 09:30:44
What's next? Some people it's easy for some people. It's not.

[P11] 09:30:49
It was, it was kind of. Okay for me because I did start employment about. 2 or 3 months before I retire because of the the job that I had before I retired I was a battle simulations SEO one North Ford of Fort Lewis, so that made it.

[P11] 09:31:10
Easier for me, it was just me and another military guy working with civilians so they found my replacement and brought my replacement in and then me and my other Sorry, in first class we talked to our officer and say, Hey, sir, we, sorry, Doug was just gonna, he gonna leave, we got his replacement.

[P11] 09:31:32
And we do this about maybe 3, 4 months out. We're gonna let him just go ahead and get ready to transition and stuff and Me and him will talk once a week and that was it, you know, so I that helped me.

[P11] 09:31:46
But a lot of other people don't get that. Well, didn't get that. I don't know how they doing it now.

[P11] 09:31:52
I don't know. But just trying to transition was. A little difficult, but I found a job and so I was working before I transitioned.

[Jessica] 09:31:53
On it.

[P11] 09:32:05
So that made it easier. It wasn't the type of job I wanted or that I per se was.

[P11] 09:32:10
Qualified for. But it was something outside of my retirement. In my disability income.

[P11] 09:32:21
I felt that I would be able to take care of my family with no problem with my wife being employed too.

[P11] 09:32:29
I'm like, hey, this should cover the mortgage. This should cover the car payments, anything and everything we need.

[P11] 09:32:34
So I felt comfortable transitioning out.

[Jessica] 09:32:40
Sharing that with us. Kind of switching gears a little bit to understanding how to use your benefits.

[Jessica] 09:32:47
We've talked about this. Quite a bit already, but can you tell me about what priority group you're in for your health care benefits now?

[P11] 09:32:55
What do you mean by that?

[Jessica] 09:32:57
Have you heard of the term priority? Groups before? In your health care process? Okay.

[P11] 09:33:00
No, man.

[Jessica] 09:33:04
What do you think it means just hearing that term? There's no right or wrong answer here. We're just trying to explain kind of what is important to you.

[P11] 09:33:10
Like that. Like I said. I think priority one for me was to be the most highest priority that receives treatment and all of that stuff are the guys that did the Iraq and Afghanistan.

[P11] 09:33:24
After that is pride guys, they're retired. Over the last 1015 years. Priority 2.

[P11] 09:33:36
Damn priority 3 is probably the guys like me that retired around. Let's do it this way.

[P11] 09:33:45
Post 9 11.

[P11] 09:33:47
3 9 11 output myself pre 9 11 so I retire right after 9 11 but it's like all the peoples after 9 11 are granted so many benefits.

[P11] 09:34:06
That is crazy. 3 9 11. That's where I say I am. I'm priority 3.

[P11] 09:34:15
So post 9 11.

[P11] 09:34:20
Priority 2. I Iraq, Afghanistan, priority 1. 3 9 11 would be me. Party 3.

[P11] 09:34:30
I follow there.

[Jessica] 09:34:31
Okay, do you basically understand? Pretty groups are based off of when and where. Someone served kind of what group they would fall into.

[P11] 09:34:40
That's what I believe, yeah.

[Jessica] 09:34:43
Awesome, thank you for that. Now we're gonna switch gears a little bit now. Thank you for sharing so much about kind of your process and kind of your understanding of everything today and how you've been going through.

[Jessica] 09:34:55
We're gonna switch gears to the ideal state a little bit and we want to hear about how you would like things to go.

[Jessica] 09:35:01
In a perfect world if you had a magic wand. So how would you want the healthcare application to go to you?

[Jessica] 09:35:08
For you in regards to learning about benefits and options you qualify for. I know you've mentioned a couple things as far as having someone sit there to help walk you through it, but Do you have any other examples?

[P11] 09:35:18
Right. Even.

[Jessica] 09:35:21
You could provide for us?

[P11] 09:35:22
Either, either something, something set up for something set up for people just to break it down and explain if you have this or this is what you are entitled to as a veteran that served the United States Army.

[P11] 09:35:43
Most of the time you just hear that oh yeah you You are entitled to emergency room treatment. You know, since you, are entitled to emergency room treatment.

[P11] 09:35:54
Within why when I go to the emergency room they still ask me for my private Insurance information. Why do you ask me that if I tell you and you see I'm in your system, I'm in deers or whatever.

[P11] 09:36:10
Why are you asking me for my private insurance. Why are you asking me that? You should need to ask me that.

[P11] 09:36:20
You shouldn't ask me that. First and foremost, because I'm here for a emergency room service that I served and you told me that I It's I have it so why are you asking me for private insurance?

[P11] 09:36:32
One of the biggest ripoff in America, private medical, medical field, biggest rip off in America.

[P11] 09:36:39
One of the biggest red blocks of So Just somebody that may like I said a 2 or 3 day thing, you know, break it down.

[P11] 09:36:50
This way you would break it down, break it down to tell me if I'm a priority one, if I'm a priority 2 if I'm a priority 3 if I have these issues going on this is where you fall this is the treatment that you're.

[P11] 09:37:02
That you're eligible for something where I have a understanding. That I can, you know.

[P11] 09:37:11
Get treatment for whatever issues I have. A lot of it is just flying blind and then once you once you kind of get out Once you kind of get out of the military and you go ahead and get into civilian life and stuff, you kind of try to forget that part, you know, unless you're disabled and if you disabled you You want to keep contact with the military so you can.

[P11] 09:37:37
Make sure that they take care of all your issues and once you reach a certain state of disability so I'm finally at a hundred percent now so I go for everything now you know so I was like I asked hey do I Do I need to keep my private insurance now?

[P11] 09:37:56
And like, no, man, you a hundred percent. You don't. You don't need to keep that no more.

[P11] 09:38:00
We got you back. We got you. But yet still I talk to other veterans and it's like, oh no, yeah, I, I got such a session.

[P11] 09:38:09
I like to get another opinion. I like to get a second opinion. This and that, you know, so people are different.

[P11] 09:38:16
I guess.

[Jessica] 09:38:21
So your ideal state would be somebody to sit down and kind of personalize it for you, tell you what you qualify for.

[P11] 09:38:29
Eligible for, you know,

[P11] 09:38:33
And then they might have done it they might have done it or whatever but I think everything is such a Set a quick pace medical field you got people to try to process a certain amount of patience per day.

[P11] 09:38:53
That's why, you know, they're not too privy to walk in or stuff like that.

[P11] 09:38:58
You need to go to special walk in clinics. And things of that nature so everything is based on time.

[P11] 09:39:05
You know, you go in and do your 15 min with your doctor and then bam you out because you got another page you need to see.

[P11] 09:39:13
And I don't think they ever developed that for healthcare. To actually take care of a person.

[P11] 09:39:19
They've developed it for monetary reasons. They understood the more patients they see today. So how do I get to see my 35, 40, my uncle's a retired doctor.

[P11] 09:39:31
That's why he's retired doctor. So I kind of have an insight on how they work because I saw how he worked.

[P11] 09:39:36
So it's all about money. More patients you see, the more you can build the insurance to get more money.

[P11] 09:39:42
So. That's why I said to me is the is more thinking of the profit margin than it is about.

[P11] 09:39:53
A person's health. If I could put it that way, that's me putting it bluntly.

[P11] 09:40:00
They're more worried about.

[P11] 09:40:04
Where they're going when they go on vacation

[P11] 09:40:09
As opposed to what I'm doing when I leave their medical facility.

[P11] 09:40:15
Nice half.

[Jessica] 09:40:15
Thanks. Thanks for sharing that. Just kind of getting fact on track here. Is there any you mentioned person but would you use any other tools?

[Jessica] 09:40:28
Or want any communication to figure out healthcare benefits. Or is it really that in person?

[P11] 09:40:39
It could be if it could be a phone call. It could be a video meeting or something, you know.

[P11] 09:40:46
Either way, I mean, and that's in person to me instead of. Calling and Leaving a message.

[P11] 09:41:01
And then not hearing back and I just had that happen too with me for transportation. I was trying to set up transportation to an appointment.

[P11] 09:41:12
And then finally I had to go to VA for issue prior to that appointment. It was only like, it was the next day actually.

[P11] 09:41:21
And I went over to the transportation and said, hey, who's? What's she guys hours?

[P11] 09:41:27
I've been calling for like 2 weeks and leaving messages and stuff and Nobody's called me back.

[P11] 09:41:33
And I think the manager of the transportation heard me talking to the lady and so he came out said, hey, here's my personal number.

[P11] 09:41:42
If you have that incident happen again, you give me a call directly. You know, and so they was like, we're gonna fix your problem.

[P11] 09:41:50
And they did. But nobody called me to tell me that I had someone was coming to pick me up the next day so I get up the next morning I'm calling like hey is anybody coming in to pick me up or anything.

[P11] 09:42:05
And there's like, yeah, I was like, well, yeah, nobody called me to let me know.

[P11] 09:42:10
So just it just personal maybe it's a yearly, a yearly.

[P11] 09:42:20
Update. And hey, this is so and so calling for VA. We want to do a yearly update to ask you to check see how you doing.

[P11] 09:42:30
To see where you had and let you know what you're eligible for, something like that, you know.

[P11] 09:42:36
That might be something that could be beneficial just to. Talk with a veteran and see where he's at.

[P11] 09:42:43
Does he have any issues? And he say, hey, I'm having problem with this. Well, you know, we'll go see your primary care provider for that, you know, go those talk to your primary care provider, make an appointment, let them know.

[P11] 09:42:55
You know, something like that.

[Jessica] 09:42:58
Great feedback. Thank you very much for sharing that. Okay, I'm gonna shift gears again a little bit to our last topic.

[Jessica] 09:43:06
I'm going to share my screen with you and show you an example of some instructions that appear on a paper healthcare benefits application.

[Jessica] 09:43:14
I'm gonna ask if you could just Read it over and take a look and then in your own words.

[Jessica] 09:43:21
Kind of just explain what these options mean to you and What you would do with this choice.

[P11] 09:43:30
Type of benefit applying for enrollment veterans applying for enrollment for the full medical benefit packets provided.

[P11] 09:43:40
And see, nobody never told me about that.

[P11] 09:43:44
Must your things and I can't read the must.

[Jessica] 09:43:49
I can, where's my cursor? I'll zoom in a little bit. Let's try not to cut it off.

[P11] 09:43:50
Your screen.

[Jessica] 09:43:55
Just let me know if I need to zoom in more.

[P11] 09:43:56
Keep going a little bit more to the left. I can. No, no, bring a. Size a little bit.

[P11] 09:44:04
Cause your, screen there you go. There you go. That's good.

[P11] 09:44:08
Must meet the eligibility requirements of whatever that is CFR. 17. That's 36 registration.

[P11] 09:44:18
Only complete sex is 1, 2, 3, and rooms not required. That's just requesting the eligibility assessment, clinical evaluation care.

[P11] 09:44:30
Care for.

[P11] 09:44:34
50% or greater.

[P11] 09:44:43
Wow.

[P11] 09:44:46
Whoa catastrophic. Whoa.

[P11] 09:44:57
Yes, or stuff, there, there's the word, they say, they're saying that like, look like, I don't know, this sounds like some stuff they're doing now.

[P11] 09:45:06
Cause this sound like the new age for military sexual trauma treatment. This sound like ship has been going on in Iraq and Afghanistan.

[P11] 09:45:15
We're doing so just. It tells me if I'm

[P11] 09:45:23
This tells me that I'd already been evaluated and I'm looking at my disability if I got 50% of greater.

[P11] 09:45:35
I don't know. I'm a little confused. I'm confused what it all is and then I wouldn't even know what

[P11] 09:45:43
To COZ or or CFR, I wouldn't even know what that is or. 38 you see I don't know what USC 31 I don't know I wouldn't even know what none of that stuff is This says record.

[P11] 09:45:59
Type of benefits applying for I I would probably check both I probably do both Just to make sure that I'm covered I wouldn't even know I think I would check both of them and roll in register

[Jessica] 09:46:15
You for explaining that and thinking aloud. I know you kind of called out a few things that were confusing that could use some additional explanation.

[Jessica] 09:46:24
Is there one thing in particular that really stands out? Here this seems really confusing.

[P11] 09:46:33
Well, just, oh, this is, the 3 after the, care for VA rated service connected disability.

[P11] 09:46:44
That's as far as I ever had to really go. I've never heard of no psychosis.

[P11] 09:46:49
Or mental illness. I have a severe case of PTSD. Lord knows, thank God I found out what that was before.

[P11] 09:46:57
Retired, cause that was my main issue, PTSD. But this, care for military sexual trauma treatment and catastrophically disabled examination.

[P11] 09:47:13
No, those got me totally confused and I believe that's more now with today's soldiers, which probably should have been.

[P11] 09:47:22
We are Vietnam veterans and probably the before that when World War 2 veterans because we had the wax and they probably went through some hail back in those days with nobody knows nobody ever listen to any of their stories but they probably went through some hail back in those days.

[P11] 09:47:42
So yeah, those 3 afternoon. Great, it's service disability connect to disability those. I wouldn't know what to say about none of those.

[P11] 09:47:52
I would I could only think about what they made me. I don't know.

[P11] 09:47:57
And I'll have to think, do I fall into that or something?

[P11] 09:48:04
I don't think they pertain to me.

[P11] 09:48:08
Well, maybe the psychosis, mental illness might pretend to me.

[Jessica] 09:48:19
I mentioned you would check both and kind of thinking back to your ideal state you've mentioned you'd really want someone to kind of sit down and Talk to you.

[P11] 09:48:29
Yeah

[Jessica] 09:48:29
Would you change anything about your ideal state after seeing these instructions?

[P11] 09:48:35
Hmm. I don't think so. I think it I think it's kind of it kind of I want to say it kinda covers everything under a umbrella that you might meet one of these criteria that you might fall under one of these criteria.

[P11] 09:48:55
So I think it kind of covers everything.

[Jessica] 09:49:01
Is it clear to you what you get if you check one or the other?

[P11] 09:49:10
No, because it doesn't tell me what

[P11] 09:49:18
The requirements of 38 CFR 17 dash 36 is I have no idea what that is.

[P11] 09:49:27
17 dash 36 and 17 dash 38. I have no idea what that means.

[P11] 09:49:33
So that would have to be broken down for me to, so what is the criteria because maybe. Maybe there's something in that.

[P11] 09:49:43
Criteria that I don't meet so I will have to know what that criteria is that's why I say I probably would check both boxes.

[P11] 09:49:51
And then they would be like, well, you know, you don't meet the criteria and 17 dash 38.

[P11] 09:49:57
So you. Whatever or you don't meet the criteria under 38 US. 31 so you don't so that's why I would check both of them and they would have to tell me why I don't meet one or the other.

[P11] 09:50:12
Or so that's why I would check both so that's why I do a lot check everything and if I don't they say oh you're not eligible for this because you got so okay fine but I checked everything so you don't tell me whether I'm eligible for it or not.

[Jessica] 09:50:30
Got it. Thank you. That's great feedback to hear. Stop sharing my screen now.

[Jessica] 09:50:36
I think that was pretty much what we wanted to go over with you today and get some feedback on but is there anything else you would like to add?

[Jessica] 09:50:44
About what we talked about today.

[P11] 09:50:46
I don't know, I, I just wish the system would get better. It's just not for me.

[P11] 09:50:53
For our future soldiers. I just wish it would get better. I think it's getting better.

[P11] 09:51:00
But who knows, it might not make it by the time I leave this guy's green earth, but I just hope that it gets better.

[P11] 09:51:08
Like I said, my major disappointment is to. See my brethren, you know brethren and sister soldiers that have been through so much.

[P11] 09:51:19
And they still tell me stories about how they can't get treated or they're still. To this day they're still fighting.

[P11] 09:51:29
To try to get. A rating. You know, and it's sad, it's sad, it's really sad.

[P11] 09:51:40
That we, put on that uniform and we put our, we will put our, and I know they did, especially being.

[P11] 09:51:48
Well, I would gladly put my life on the line. And for this country, for you to sleep well at night, for anybody else in this country to sleep peacefully at night and know that they're protected.

[P11] 09:52:01
And I would die for this country without a doubt.

[P11] 09:52:06
But because I didn't. Serve in a campaign. Don't treat me as less. No treat me as if I'm not a patriot for my country and I think that's where a lot of people get lost.

[P11] 09:52:21
Even the ones that served my cousin did 3 campaigns in Iraq so in his sense, He's a better man than me.

[P11] 09:52:33
Because he followed in combat. You know, and I tell them, if I would have had to go, I would have went too.

[P11] 09:52:42
I, they just didn't call me. But that doesn't make you better than me that doesn't make you better than me that doesn't make you more qualified.

[P11] 09:52:47
But then when you get into a soldier's mentality, you understand that's how they think.

[P11] 09:52:52
Those who done it those who went into the shit and come out feel that they are superior. To others that didn't.

[P11] 09:53:03
And I wish that would change. It probably won't because that's just the mindset of a soldier.

[P11] 09:53:11
That's it.

[Jessica] 09:53:14
Thank you very much on many levels. We just really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today.

[Jessica] 09:53:21
It's hearing these stories that really help us continue to work and iterate. Trying to make things better.

[Jessica] 09:53:28
So your feedback is very helpful as we continue to work on the site and making sure it works for veterans.

[Jessica] 09:53:33
So I just wanna say thank you, we appreciate it.

[P11] 09:53:35
You're welcome. I hope you guys succeed.

[Jessica] 09:53:38
Yes, it's a lot of work. And thank you. So lastly, Perry Gian will be sending you the ones that recruited you just a little blurb that you can pass along to other veterans if you know anyone else that wants to participate in these research studies.

[Jessica] 09:53:52
And tell their stories and help us as well. So thank you very much and enjoy the rest of your day.

[P11] 09:53:54
Okay.

[P11] 09:53:59
You too. Thank you very much.

[Jessica] 09:54:02
Thank you, you too.

[P11] 09:54:04
Okay, bye-bye.
