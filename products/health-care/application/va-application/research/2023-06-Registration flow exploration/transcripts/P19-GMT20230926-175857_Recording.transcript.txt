WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.600
Oh.

2
00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:11.740
Katelyn (moderator): okay, now that we're recording, could you confirm with me? Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today.

3
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:23.370
Katelyn (moderator): Alright, great! Let's get started. first question for you. Are you currently enrolled and using healthcare benefits from the VA.

4
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:24.640
P19: Yes.

5
00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:30.420
Katelyn (moderator): great. And how often do you visit a VA facility?

6
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.300
P19:  probably monthly.

7
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:41.110
Katelyn (moderator): Monthly. Okay? And what about how often you visit Va. Gov.

8
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.619
P19: I actually was called

9
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.240
P19: cause. I actually use the app? The Va app.

10
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.409
Katelyn (moderator): Okay? So yeah.

11
00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.589
Katelyn (moderator): how frequently would you say you use the app? Just curious.

12
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.070
P19: Quite often. probably

13
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.670
P19: 10 times a month or something.

14
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.920
Katelyn (moderator): Okay, yeah, that's pretty. That's pretty frequently.

15
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:25.959
Katelyn (moderator): So let's talk about the application process for healthcare benefits. Could you explain to me in your own words, the process you took when you applied for benefits.

16
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.449
P19: Let me think it was so long ago.

17
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:41.579
P19:  I think back then it was just a paper application. and we had to send it in. I'm thinking that's what it was. It was so long ago.

18
00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:49.950
Katelyn (moderator): Okay, yeah. Do you recall if you completed that paper application on your own, or did you have assistance?

19
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.700
P19: No, I completed my mom.

20
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:59.970
Katelyn (moderator): Well, that's very that's admirable. We hear a lot that people need some assistance with that application.

21
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:11.400
Katelyn (moderator):  okay, was there any part of that process? And you mentioned it was a while ago. But thinking back to that time. Was there any part of the process that was difficult or confusing to you?

22
00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:26.509
P19:  No, not really. I think it's just mainly because we just paper at the time, and now we so take the full. So

23
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.600
P19: because that was

24
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:39.990
P19: Oh, gosh! 2,000 12! Hmm! So it was. It was very awesome, too.

25
00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:48.010
Katelyn (moderator): but just the inconvenience of being paid for application was the only issue for you at the time.

26
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.979
P19: Yeah, I think they make it easier now.

27
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.080
P19: you know just few clicks and

28
00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:57.560
P19: yeah

29
00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:04.680
Katelyn (moderator): lot faster that maybe, than sending in exactly.

30
00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:11.599
Katelyn (moderator): You have a recollection of the amount of information you had to provide on that application.

31
00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.430
P19: You just had to, of course, your name. So security number the your service.

32
00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:21.880
P19: What branch?

33
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.220
P19: We've got out. and

34
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.240
P19: what if? If and if you have gotten compensation, or whatever

35
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.540
P19: I think.

36
00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.700
P19: if I'm not mistaken, that was mainly the general questions.

37
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:53.869
Katelyn (moderator): Okay? And then this bit of a different question. So when it comes to registering and healthcare at the Va. What does that mean to you?

38
00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.210
P19: What do you mean

39
00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:03.750
Katelyn (moderator): the term registering and healthcare at Va, what does that association mean to you?

40
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.719
P19: I'm I'm not understanding the question.

41
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.930
P19: Okay, someone just to just to register? Or

42
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:21.630
Katelyn (moderator): yeah, the term registration registering as an act. What does that mean to you when it comes to healthcare?

43
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:28.509
P19: I mean, cause it's basically what you have to do if you're a civilian, too. But

44
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.549
P19: I will just think that

45
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:43.469
P19: since we've already been through the service, and had deers and tricia and all that, everything should have been already there. So it should have been to me it should have been automatic. But

46
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.410
Katelyn (moderator): yeah, okay, that's good feedback. Thank you.

47
00:04:48.300 --> 00:05:00.510
Katelyn (moderator): Let's get into choosing benefits and kind of understanding those benefits. How did you determine what health benefits you could get when you completed the application?

48
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.060
P19:  It actually.

49
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:16.840
P19: totus what we could, because you have, like the tears. the different tiers. So now I'm actually at the top tier, because I'm a hundred percent. So

50
00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.919
P19: it shows you the tears

51
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.120
P19: cause. At first I was only like 30%. So.

52
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:24.580
Katelyn (moderator): okay.

53
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:31.440
Katelyn (moderator): yeah, what resources were you using there to understand what you qualify for

54
00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:33.610
P19: it? Actually,

55
00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:36.449
P19: if I'm

56
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:47.290
P19: I'm trying to think back, it might have been on the paper. But then, again, it might have been online about the different tiers that if you have this percent then.

57
00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:53.069
P19: because I knew, I think at first I was being a copay. But now don't pay a coke

58
00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:58.019
Katelyn (moderator): gotcha. So it sounds like you changed tiers there

59
00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:04.860
Katelyn (moderator): and kind of a mix, maybe of resources, paper or and online.

60
00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:17.569
Katelyn (moderator): Okay? And then. when you were getting those healthcare benefits, did you want care for just one specific health care concern? Or did you

61
00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:21.670
Katelyn (moderator): have interest in enrolling in full healthcare coverage?

62
00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:26.520
P19: Well, I had actually a school healthcare cover. So.

63
00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:40.170
P19: but I know with a certain tier, you only get a certain thing like now I can get dental as well. since I am a total, permanent 100%.

64
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:41.960
Katelyn (moderator): Okay?

65
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:53.369
Katelyn (moderator): And then next question, can you explain to me in your own words what you get with your health care, benefits? I know you just mentioned? Do you get dental

66
00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:56.289
P19: collaboration

67
00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.430
P19: and mental health

68
00:06:58.570 --> 00:06:59.450
P19: and

69
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:02.180
P19: this overall Hill

70
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:04.780
Katelyn (moderator): full health

71
00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:12.699
Katelyn (moderator): average. Yep. And then what help or resources did you rely on to help you figure this all out.

72
00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:22.549
P19: as I actually probably went to the app, not the VA. App cause. It wasn't here then, just the e-benefits and stuff.

73
00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:25.070
Katelyn (moderator): Okay, he benefits.

74
00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:27.530
Katelyn (moderator): And then.

75
00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:35.109
Katelyn (moderator): you mentioned. Here's I'm curious. If you're familiar with the term priority group.

76
00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:36.320
P19: Yeah.

77
00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:37.520
Katelyn (moderator): okay?

78
00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:42.359
Katelyn (moderator): And it sounds like you're in the top priority group.

79
00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:43.420
P19: Yes.

80
00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:46.550
Katelyn (moderator): alright.

81
00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:57.380
Katelyn (moderator): And then could you describe how that priority group information was communicated to you, and how you understood the impact you and your benefits.

82
00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:59.759
P19: Well, I'm

83
00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:07.180
P19: cause it wasn't explained. I just have to find the information on your own. So

84
00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:17.119
Katelyn (moderator): okay, it was not communicated to you. So I communicate to everybody else now. So

85
00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:22.630
P19: oh, that's good. So is something you have to learn. Yeah, so right?

86
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:29.290
Katelyn (moderator): So is that another thing you want to. Maybe, Ebene, if it's for or some other resource

87
00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:30.420
Katelyn (moderator): online.

88
00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:37.709
Katelyn (moderator): And then before you completed enrollment. It sounds like

89
00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:46.969
Katelyn (moderator): there wasn't much communicated to you about priority groups. But were you aware of priority groups or copays as part of the healthcare benefits? Package?

90
00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:56.540
P19: Not at first. I had someone that was already receiving benefit. So he was letting me know some things.

91
00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:59.050
P19: and then the rest of I had to find out.

92
00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.920
Katelyn (moderator): Okay. and

93
00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:10.010
Katelyn (moderator): from that friend. You knew that had benefits already.

94
00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:17.510
Katelyn (moderator): What all did you understand from that assistance? What? What were you aware of?

95
00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:22.379
P19:  like the different facilities? First of all

96
00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:23.430
P19: that.

97
00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:26.980
P19: because he was going all the way to Alabama.

98
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:32.130
P19: and we're in Georgia.

99
00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:37.480
P19: and but then to know that we have some closer. So

100
00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:41.940
P19: I mean. He taught me that, and didn't buy travel. pay, and

101
00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.389
P19: all that.

102
00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:57.659
Katelyn (moderator): And then, since you've been using your benefits, what have you learned about priority groups or those tiers, and the impact it's had on you and your healthcare benefits that maybe you wish you knew

103
00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:59.489
Katelyn (moderator): before our application.

104
00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.650
Well,

105
00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:07.749
P19: But the difference stuff that I can get now.

106
00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:14.879
P19: II don't think it would have affected any, because I wasn't at that tier or at that

107
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:19.210
P19: priority group back then than I am now. So

108
00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:20.770
P19: it was okay.

109
00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:24.810
Katelyn (moderator): Okay. that makes sense.

110
00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:42.529
Katelyn (moderator): So shifting topics into an ideal state for this whole process. Could you describe how, in a perfect world. You would want the healthcare application process to go for you in regards to learning about those benefit options and what you qualify for.

111
00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:48.860
P19: Well, if it was well

112
00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:53.900
P19: for the next generation, if it was just

113
00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:58.700
P19: playing. You know this.

114
00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:07.820
P19: if you have this percentage or this percentage, this is what you get right here. and because I actually

115
00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:11.799
P19: know someone else that is

116
00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:16.300
P19: getting healthcare. But they didn't know about travel.

117
00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:23.450
P19: So they've been just going back and forth to the doctor and not getting travel back

118
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:25.300
P19: for years.

119
00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:27.830
P19: So actually since 98.

120
00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:35.919
P19: So yes, so II had to tell them I was like, no, you can get travel pay.

121
00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:43.160
P19: so it's it's I guess, if you don't know, you don't know. So I try to teach anybody.

122
00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:46.309
P19: So then we'll have to learn the hard way like I did. So.

123
00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:57.810
Katelyn (moderator): yeah. so it sounds like more explicit information about those different priority groups and what you're entitled to in them

124
00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:08.619
Katelyn (moderator): that makes sense to me. And then let's see here, how would you want to learn about how to use the benefits that you're eligible for?

125
00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:18.570
P19: Well

126
00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:31.129
P19: for someone that doesn't know. Like I was saying, if I mean, if it was just totally like on well, not just on the Internet, but

127
00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:36.079
P19:  well, yeah, basically, cause which is Internet

128
00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:39.289
P19: now. So if it was just

129
00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:43.989
P19: playing like, okay, this is this is what you get right here.

130
00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:45.210
P19: and

131
00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:52.300
P19: something that they don't have to go looking for. It's like under, like the the Va app.

132
00:12:52.950 --> 00:13:06.100
P19: I mean, that will be easier, since everything's as I was told, it's gonna start being on the Va app. So if they just go to the Va app and just make it so simple for them to be able to find certain teams.

133
00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:14.579
Katelyn (moderator): okay, and make it easy to to find. Or maybe even, it's just showing up. So you can't miss it.

134
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:27.010
Katelyn (moderator): Okay? And then what tools I know you mentioned the app. But what tools, communication, or other people

135
00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:30.890
Katelyn (moderator): could make this the best possible process in your mind?

136
00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:41.260
P19: I guess if

137
00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:49.290
P19: there was more education on it.

138
00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:56.429
Katelyn (moderator):  okay, could you say more about that? Like what that education would look like

139
00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:57.330
P19: like? How.

140
00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:03.059
P19: before we get out? If they educate you on, how to

141
00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:08.230
P19: go from military life to civilian life and all the aspects of it.

142
00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:11.650
P19: If that was a part of your

143
00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:14.870
P19: Bts plan

144
00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:25.910
P19: to for the transition. This is the app. This is what you need to do. This is how this looks on the outside cause. Of course, when you're in.

145
00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:27.710
P19: it looks so totally different.

146
00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:36.760
P19: But then, when you get out, you gotta find out stuff, cause there's no one telling you anything. You just having to search for it yourself.

147
00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:47.860
Katelyn (moderator): I see. Okay, so more proactive education preparing you for navigating the Va system. It sounds like.

148
00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:48.680
P19: yeah.

149
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.170
Katelyn (moderator): that's good feedback. Thank you.

150
00:14:53.480 --> 00:15:00.830
Katelyn (moderator): And then how would you like to discover what options you have to get the level of care? That's right for you.

151
00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:13.799
Katelyn (moderator): Okay, I said again. I'm sorry I got distracted by my dogs. They how would you like to discover what options you have to get the level of care? That's right for you

152
00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:24.600
P19: trying to think about that one duh

153
00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:27.560
P19: about the care that we get.

154
00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:29.150
P19: the options.

155
00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:33.040
P19: Okay? Well.

156
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:44.990
P19: I mean, we have plenty of. We have a lot of options. But it's just takes a while for certain. like

157
00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:49.200
P19: doctors are

158
00:15:49.790 --> 00:16:00.470
P19: specific group to to get involved or to be able to get an appointment with, or whatever. Thank goodness, I don't have any issues here in Georgia, but

159
00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:09.290
P19: I've heard that. like with mental health and stuff. it has taken over 2 years for someone to get into mental health

160
00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:17.220
P19: for just for a check. I mean, just just somebody just to talk to somebody. So

161
00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:19.000
that's not good.

162
00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:21.689
Katelyn (moderator): No. not at all

163
00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:35.240
Katelyn (moderator): that's good to know. Thank you. And then what information would be important to you. So you feel confident when having to choose between healthcare benefit options.

164
00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:39.690
P19: Okay, so that here.

165
00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:49.229
Katelyn (moderator): sure. What information would be important to you. So you feel confident when having to choose between healthcare benefit options.

166
00:16:53.850 --> 00:17:02.399
P19: I guess if they were to have like specific, because I know when I do go to like, make an appointment, certain

167
00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:05.280
P19: things are not there.

168
00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:10.180
P19: So you have to just go through your primary doctor.

169
00:17:11.099 --> 00:17:14.710
P19: I guess I guess, cause it's a specialty or something.

170
00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:22.870
Katelyn (moderator): I see, certain types of care are not available at certain locations. I see. Okay.

171
00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:27.890
P19: I know what cert with certain medicine and certain devices

172
00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:33.869
P19: you can't go through the app to purchase. I mean to order. Em.

173
00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:42.020
P19: You have to go through your primary and then your primary, or whoever sees the message.

174
00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:54.919
P19: they'll say they got the message and they gonna order something. Then you gotta wait. So it's it's a lot. Cause I'm waiting on something, and it's still hanging. It's been over a week and a half. So

175
00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:56.010
Katelyn (moderator): okay.

176
00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:57.500
P19: so yeah.

177
00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:09.720
P19: if it's just something like if we can just go to the app, and it says all the medicine or devices that you have, and if it's time for you to order another one. If it's just right there

178
00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:15.580
P19: to be able to order like a tens machine. I need one. and it's been a week and a half.

179
00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:17.889
P19: Well, 2 weeks, and

180
00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:21.790
P19: I hadn't heard anything else about it. So

181
00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:32.840
P19: okay, I'm sorry about that, but they say they they ordered it. So there's been 2 weeks. So I don't know where it is.

182
00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:35.389
Katelyn (moderator): Okay, sounds like more

183
00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:41.819
Katelyn (moderator): communication about those things. Okay, that's good. Feedback. Thank you.

184
00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:49.689
Katelyn (moderator): Okay. So for the next topic. I'm going to share my screen.

185
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:59.810
Katelyn (moderator): and we'll look at an example of some instructions that appear on healthcare application. Okay, just 1 s.

186
00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:01.279
P19: Yes, that

187
00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:04.690
P19: sit down.

188
00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:11.179
P19: I saw them on the camera.

189
00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:25.100
P19: The dogs do not care that we are doing a research session. Are you able to see the paper instructions. Okay.

190
00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:26.770
Katelyn (moderator): okay, perfect.

191
00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:38.109
Katelyn (moderator): All right. So just taking a moment to look these over. And then could you explain to me in your own words what these options mean and how they're different.

192
00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:42.610
P19: What? What these

193
00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:46.130
P19: the enrollment in the registration or what correct?

194
00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:47.060
P19: Okay.

195
00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:30.840
P19: okay, registration is like you just filling something out just to get registered for, but to and actually enroll in it. That means I want to be in this right here, and

196
00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:37.109
P19: I gotta meet these certain things to be able to get enrolled in it.

197
00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:38.880
Katelyn (moderator): Okay.

198
00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:48.809
Katelyn (moderator): then, if you are applying for the first time. which one would you select? And could you explain your thinking behind that

199
00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:06.429
P19: if I was doing for the first time I would actually

200
00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:17.889
P19: probably just do in boom.

201
00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:29.390
P19: Because I know when I did, I did, Bobo. okay. and the above level.

202
00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:36.300
Katelyn (moderator): And you would still make that same choice today.

203
00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:42.870
P19: Now, when I see enrollment not required. No, I'm just

204
00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:44.170
Katelyn (moderator): okay.

205
00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:54.949
P19: But of course, we don't look at everything. So I see enrollment not required. But so just to register for it. Yeah.

206
00:21:55.360 --> 00:22:00.279
Katelyn (moderator): Okay? And that that phrasing right? There is the reason why you would choose that.

207
00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:01.500
P19: Yes.

208
00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:15.019
Katelyn (moderator): okay. And then, is there anything about these instructions that you find confusing or need more explanation? For before you would make your choice on the form.

209
00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:17.749
P19: Well, see?

210
00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:26.109
P19: As I said before, I'm not reading in quotation, mark in in the parentheses.

211
00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:31.510
P19: It would make it confusing. So that's why I probably did do both of them.

212
00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:37.869
P19: But actually reading veterans meets the enrollment not required eligibility thing.

213
00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:39.580
P19: I will only do them

214
00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:42.479
P19: the registration part instead of the enrollment.

215
00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:44.490
Katelyn (moderator): Okay.

216
00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:59.769
Katelyn (moderator): then, now that you've seen an example of choosing benefit options, would you change anything about the ideal state we were talking about before this.

217
00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:02.680
P19: No.

218
00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:08.270
Katelyn (moderator): alright.

219
00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:14.890
P19: that's it for the paper instructions. And then

220
00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:23.509
Katelyn (moderator): the paper instructions we looked at on the screen.

221
00:23:23.850 --> 00:23:30.409
Katelyn (moderator): So just wrapping up here. Is there anything else you would like to add to what we talked about today?

222
00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:32.030
P19: No mail.

223
00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:36.160
Katelyn (moderator): Amen. Any questions for me.

224
00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:38.409
P19: no mayhem.

225
00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:41.140
P19: Oh, yes, I do.

226
00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:48.930
P19: Are you over? You know the people that are over the app and or anything, and

227
00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:51.139
P19: cause I know with

228
00:23:51.190 --> 00:24:02.810
P19: I know it isn't is off talk, but what it is about health care like trying to do travel, pay, and everything you actually have to look for is not

229
00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:05.150
P19: right. There

230
00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:09.369
P19: you have to go through different steps to actually find it.

231
00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:11.410
Katelyn (moderator): Okay.

232
00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:14.920
P19: some people probably wouldn't want to do all that

233
00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:19.730
P19: I need to travel. But

234
00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:22.649
P19: but yeah, to make that a little bit easier for

235
00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:39.780
Katelyn (moderator): oh, thank you for sharing that. Yeah. I don't work on the apps team, but we do have like a shared ecosystem with all the different teams who work on Va products. So that is useful to know especially since it relates to healthcare.

236
00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:42.749
Katelyn (moderator): I'll try to get that message passed along.

237
00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:46.120
P19: Okay.

238
00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:50.220
Katelyn (moderator): alright. Thank you so much for

239
00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:56.660
Katelyn (moderator): everything you've shared to day. We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us. And

240
00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:04.959
Katelyn (moderator): what you shared with us today helps us build better products and improve products for veterans like you. So we really appreciate it.

241
00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:15.320
Katelyn (moderator):  ergian, we'll be sending you a note after this that you can share with any other veterans if you want to get them involved in research as well.

242
00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:18.050
P19: Okay, otherwise.

243
00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:24.810
Katelyn (moderator): Thank you very much again, and enjoy the rest of your day. All right. You, too. Thank you. All right.

244
00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:26.280
Katelyn (moderator): bye.
