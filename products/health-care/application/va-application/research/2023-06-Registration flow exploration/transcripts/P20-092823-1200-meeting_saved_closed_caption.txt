Okay.

[Jessica] 09:05:18
Okay, and now back to that observer. I know Per Gian mentioned and asked when you signed up if you'd be okay with observers, but I just want to double check and make sure that you're still okay with that for today.

[P20] 09:05:29

Okay. Thank you.

[Hieu Vo] 09:06:02
Thank you for joining us today.

[Jessica] 09:06:06
Awesome, thank you. Okay, so now I want to ask if you're comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today.

[P20] 09:06:14
Yes, Okay.

[Jessica] 09:06:15
Okay, and just so you know too, we just use the recordings to confirm that our notes are accurate.

[Jessica] 09:06:20
We've captured your opinions correctly. And then these recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis and none of your comments will be attributed to you.

[Jessica] 09:06:28
It's all anonymized. So report findings out in groups like 5 out of 10 or if we use a quote we give you a participant ID like P 7.

[Jessica] 09:06:38
So now I've kind of gone over that. Are you still okay if we record our audio today?

[P20] 09:06:43
Yes.

[Jessica] 09:06:45
Okay, I'm gonna get that started and once it starts I'm just gonna confirm. On the recording.

[Jessica] 09:06:52
Okay, so I've started the recording and just as like mentioned, I'd like to confirm, are you comfortable if I record our screen and audio as we talk today?

[P20] 09:07:00
Yes.

[Jessica] 09:07:02
Great. Okay, and I will dive in. To our session here. So a few warm-up questions that we'll start with.

[Jessica] 09:07:10
When was your last appointment at a VA facility where you were seen for medical reasons?

[P20] 09:07:19
A month ago.

[Jessica] 09:07:22
Okay. Are you currently enrolled for VA health care benefits?

[P20] 09:07:27
Yes.

[Jessica] 09:07:29
Yes. Okay.

[Jessica] 09:07:32
Can you explain to me in your own words the process you took when you applied for those health care benefits?

[P20] 09:07:40
I usually go on WWW dot Was it VA dot or no e benefits?

[Jessica] 09:07:47
Okay, so you

[P20] 09:07:48
And go through the steps of whatever I needed to do.

[Jessica] 09:07:53
Okay, sounds like you did this all online about how long ago Did you apply?

[P20] 09:07:59
For my original or just any anyone which Any benefit. Okay. Thank you. Well, actually I did probably about 3 months ago, about 2 months ago.

[Jessica] 09:08:05
Anyone just

[Jessica] 09:08:22
Okay, actually we had our second observer jump in. I'm sorry to interrupt you, but I'm just gonna let her in real quick.

[Jessica] 09:08:30
Before we get going too much further.

[Jessica] 09:08:38
Alright. And then Just connected? Okay. Her other observer is on the line, so continue.

[Jessica] 09:08:49
Kind of going back to that healthcare application that you completed online. Was there any part of the process that you found frustrating or difficult?

[P20] 09:08:55
Okay.

[P20] 09:09:01
No, the only thing was I'm not sure if I did it right because it was actually a reference to which I didn't do a follow-up in reference to doing the PACT and the PACT Act I meant.

[P20] 09:09:13
And I thought I was just putting in on it to get reevaluated, but I think I put it in as like a new claim so I don't think I Did right because when you'd said sign up for the PACK they directed to go back to the

[P20] 09:09:32
Through the like file and the claim type error, but I don't think that's exactly what was supposed to be done.

[Jessica] 09:09:40
Yeah, can you expand on that a little bit more? Were you looking for?

[P20] 09:09:44
Well, it's back when when you were like deployed with the back end with like the smoke and like stuff that in mess with your sinuses and different stuff like that.

[P20] 09:09:58
You're supposed to be able to put in it better than I think the deadline was like September first or something.

[P20] 09:10:04
I can't remember. But it was directing you to go back through. Like, benefits to foul a claim.

[P20] 09:10:10
Whereas I've been talking to people I think you're supposed to go through your regular PCP doctor for them to evaluate you.

[Jessica] 09:10:20
. With it We were just trying to get more health care benefits through that process.

[P20] 09:10:24
Yes, yes, through the, yes, but through the pack, there was like a new something new that they.

[P20] 09:10:30
Found that could have. Affected you while you were deployed.

[Jessica] 09:10:37
Bye.

[P20] 09:10:37
Thanks, and different stuff.

[Jessica] 09:10:43
I think that and throughout this health care application process. What is recollection just about the amount of information and what information you had to provide?

[P20] 09:10:54
Well going through it I didn't have to provide anything because I was just Go back on something that I had already applied for just.

[P20] 09:11:04
Do wanna reent I guess reeneration on what I had already applied for.

[Jessica] 09:11:10
Got it.

[P20] 09:11:10
Or had already been given but I didn't know if it was like a extra step or I didn't fully understand cause once you You know how when you go through the process it takes you it just clicked this link to file it but it took you back to actually filing a claim which I'm not sure.

[P20] 09:11:28
If that was the correct step, if that makes sense.

[Jessica] 09:11:32
That does. Thank you for sharing that feedback. When it comes to the term registering and healthcare at the VA, Can you tell me what that means to you?

[P20] 09:11:44
Just to go, normally when I do stuff, I do it online. So I just go in through e benefits and.

[P20] 09:11:52
If I need an appointment or medication or. The education, anything needed. I just. Do it through the benefits.

[P20] 09:12:02
And most times since they've been outskirts, so what area to redirect you to go.

[P20] 09:12:07
To various different websites that But my normal thing is that I start with the benefits and then fit out.

[P20] 09:12:16
Do me out to go to another. Website. I just follow the prompts on the screen.

[Jessica] 09:12:23
Thanks for explaining that. So when you were kind of applying for these health benefits. How did you determine?

[P20] 09:12:28
Okay.

[Jessica] 09:12:33
What you could get when you recently completed that healthcare application.

[P20] 09:12:42
A originally it comes from just in general, you know, when you and your friends talk about, hey, this is available.

[P20] 09:12:50
This is available and then you just go in and do the research for yourself. So, once man, some friends, you know, hey, this is out there, you can apply for this, you are eligible to get this, then once we get it, you know, should Google and like I say, it benefits this.

[P20] 09:13:10
Great with information because it's pretty much self-explanatory of whatever you need. But it's been like, like you can go through your benefits, but a lot of stuff has been.

[P20] 09:13:22
Spaced out from there, but you can still go through there and it'll direct you to what other website that they're using.

[Jessica] 09:13:30
Thanks for explaining that. So kind of word of mouth and then doing research on your own. What other resources did you use to understand what health care benefits you qualify for?

[P20] 09:13:45
Really word of mouth and research. That's mainly. That's mainly it.

[P20] 09:13:52
Researching it myself.

[Jessica] 09:13:54
Got it.

[P20] 09:13:55
Or like different, just say different groups that you follow on social media too that's real, beneficiary too.

[P20] 09:14:02
Or just, yes, like. Folks talk about everything. So like social media is real. H are big, plus 2.

[P20] 09:14:11
Of telling you what's going on. Oh, what's out there that you can apply for.

[P20] 09:14:16
Or the internet in general, not just social media.

[Jessica] 09:14:22
And when you were applying for the health care benefits, did you only want to get care for one specific health concern or were you interested in full health care coverage?

[P20] 09:14:33
Full healthcare coverage or mainly anything that happened to me while I was in the military.

[Jessica] 09:14:41
Okay. Kind of looking back now that you've been using your health care benefits. Is there anything you wish you would have known during the application process?

[P20] 09:14:54
Not really, cause like I say, the application process is really self explanatory. It takes you from step to step.

[P20] 09:15:05
And everything just. Well, another thing that could be added like just say for instance. If your first time, it could, it would be beneficial for they say, hey, this is information that you would need before you start the application.

[P20] 09:15:22
Whereas you going through the application and it was like. When would you discharge from this to the station or XYZ that would be, information that you will have to gather for like specific dates and where you was at addresses to.

[P20] 09:15:41
Facilities that you've been to.

[Jessica] 09:15:45
That makes sense. Shift to our next topic here and talk about just kind of understanding how to use your healthcare benefits and what you get with those.

[Jessica] 09:15:57
So. Can you explain to me in your own words what you get with your VA health care benefits today?

[P20] 09:16:04
You can go to, military to facilities for, you know, any health care problems that you need and just say for instance like us, we, where we're at, which is in You Fellow, we're not within the mile radius of a VA facility.

[P20] 09:16:23
So we have the. Authority to go to like a urgent care for your regular emergency room long as you follow the proper protocol like they have a 72 h notification if I go to the ER and I'll call that 72 h and let them know, hey, I'm at the emergency room.

[P20] 09:16:40
Then they will cover that visit.

[Jessica] 09:16:44
Got it.

[P20] 09:16:44
Instead of having a driver hour to go to a VA. Doctor or facility.

[Jessica] 09:16:53
Is there anything else with your healthcare benefits?

[P20] 09:16:59
Medicine that you need, you can go, you benefits in order so you don't have to.

[P20] 09:17:03
Love you seeing your doctor and your prescriptions are up to date. You can just go online to reorder your prescriptions.

[P20] 09:17:10
And all of that so that's a plus and just say for instance if you're your thing is expired or something you can do an online appointment with your doctor or your nurse and they can update your records to where you can get your medicine as to where if your prescription runs out.

[Jessica] 09:17:31
Oh, thank you. I know you still, you mentioned a lot of talking. That want other people and doing your own research online but What resource did you use to help this figure it out figure out these benefits or is it just kind of as you went and used them?

[Jessica] 09:17:47
Did you learn how to VA health care benefits were available to you?

[P20] 09:17:51
Yes, as I went and Just more as researchers I did the information is there and it pretty much tell you hey if you did this if this happened it's pretty much laid out because 9 times out of 10 if you have a question that question has been asked and the answer will be there.

[P20] 09:18:09
If you want to Google it for someone else with the same question.

[Jessica] 09:18:15
Got it. Thanks for that. Can you tell me more about what priority group you're in for your healthcare benefits today?

[P20] 09:18:23
What do you mean by priority group?

[Jessica] 09:18:27
Have you not heard of that term before?

[P20] 09:18:30
Priority group.

[Jessica] 09:18:32
No worries. Well, what do you think they are? There's no right or wrong answer here.

[P20] 09:18:34
Yeah.

[Jessica] 09:18:38
We're just trying to want you to explain your understanding to what you think that would mean and how it would impact or be important to your healthcare benefits.

[P20] 09:18:46
Our priority means urgent. So is that like a urgent group that you're in or I'm guess I'm not following the pushed it, doing is their priority group for the EBA is that

[P20] 09:18:59
Like what groups I attend or have attended or

[P20] 09:19:04
I'm not, I'm not fully understanding that question. Cause I've never heard that time of priority.

[Jessica] 09:19:08
No worries.

[Jessica] 09:19:13
Well, that's all we're trying to kind of. It's kind of like just are you aware of it?

[Jessica] 09:19:18
Have you heard it before? And then if not, like, what would you think? Okay.

[P20] 09:19:19
No, I'm not aware of a I guess a group that you go to priority, I don't something that needs urgent attention.

[Jessica] 09:19:29
Got it.

[P20] 09:19:30
Maybe I've heard it, but it's been a different term. I'm not I'm not familiar with the priority group.

[Jessica] 09:19:36
Okay. Gonna kinda shift us gears again to our next topic and we're gonna talk a little bit just kind of like the ideal state for applying for VA health care.

[Jessica] 09:19:47
So I wonder if you could describe in a perfect world like a the auto magic wand, what would you want the healthcare application process to go for you?

[P20] 09:20:02
You said how would I want it to go? As in doing it online or just. Do an application.

[Jessica] 09:20:04
Yeah, like.

[Jessica] 09:20:08
Yeah, like how would you like to apply or how would you like to learn about what benefit options are out there and what you qualify for.

[P20] 09:20:17
I mean, they and I forgot to add this to one of the previous questions that you asked. I do send out different like I get I think emails throughout the some different organizations that I've joined and I can't think of the names right off but they actually send out emails also and let you know what's out there and hey if you did this if you did that.

[P20] 09:20:38
Like you get various emails from different VA organizations in breakfast to whether I've signed up wherever. In it lets you know hey this is available this is available and different stuff that they have going on so that's the way and then on the emails if you wanna apply for you can click apply in that direction to it.

[P20] 09:20:58
Then it's like. Another group send out, just say emails on Wednesday and they said, Hey, this is going on in your area if you wanna apply, apply.

[P20] 09:21:09
So it's the resources are out there. They, like I say, emails is there.

[P20] 09:21:15
So the steps, if you want to apply ages, hit apply and it's.

[Jessica] 09:21:20
. I guess is there anything you would in a perfect world or for other people playing in the future that you'd want to change or just kind of is there anything you'd like to add about the process for Okay.

[P20] 09:21:28
Huh.

[P20] 09:21:32
Hello, it's pretty much that fixed, you just apply. Like I said, the information is there.

[Jessica] 09:21:36
Okay.

[P20] 09:21:38
They have it laid out for you. It's just up to you too. Follow it and answer the questions.

[Jessica] 09:21:40
Got it.

[Jessica] 09:21:46
Got it. I guess how it's laid out. Is there anything you would? That would make it easier for you to learn what health care benefits you're eligible for.

[P20] 09:21:57
Now for me, then that I'm not going to say I'm old or, you know, but I would say more of, Just save for older people like it will be propagating if they cause people still work on getting mail and stuff.

[P20] 09:22:14
They're not into technology so they can send out memos and Let them know, hey, if you need this contact, this number, but put a number to a person instead of where you're getting in.

[P20] 09:22:24
Or recording that says press one for this 3 for this you know it's just recording at the recording.

[P20] 09:22:30
For older people to make it a little simpler to what you dial that you get an actual person. Yes, of where you keep pushing these numbers.

[P20] 09:22:38
And We route is just you're in a whirlwind on the phone. So like for me because I'm considering myself younger and I'm into technology, everything is pretty much laid out but where you get older people.

[P20] 09:22:51
Or not even older people that people that suffer from PTSD and different stuff. Give them a direct tool like a person you call down this number and it takes you where you Need to go to a person instead of like press one for this number 2 for this number because Call in the VA by phone is it can be a headache.

[Jessica] 09:23:14
Let's keep back and thanks for sharing that. Just kind of going back onto that ideals.

[Jessica] 09:23:22
Day is there. Kind of other than kind of a direct person to talk to. What else could help it make it easier for you to discover?

[Jessica] 09:23:30
Kind of healthcare options and levels of care.

[P20] 09:23:33
I mean, it's nothing that can be done easier because like I said, everything is. It's there that you need is just up to the person to use to tools that it's always that's already been presented to you.

[P20] 09:23:46
Okay.

[Jessica] 09:23:47
Got it. And if you were making a choice between health care benefit options, what information would you need to feel confident?

[Jessica] 09:23:56
And kind of your decision there?

[P20] 09:24:00
Just say I go to education for and prime example. Now that We just deal with healthcare or are you speaking on anything in general?

[Jessica] 09:24:10
Mostly just health care focused.

[P20] 09:24:12
Okay, so, gotcha.

[P20] 09:24:16
How is that thing can be done easy here? It's staying.

[Jessica] 09:24:21
Okay, that's good to hear, but.

[P20] 09:24:22
The information is there. You just got that. Like I haven't really had a

[P20] 09:24:28
That that's not there that I would need now if you would say lack of reading They're just thinking whatever, but the information is there if you read it.

[P20] 09:24:40
Everything that you need to apply for. I mean, it literally breaks it down if you want to apply for this and this hurts and is what causes this like everything you need to apply for a benefit it's pretty much laid out if you go through the benefits during my time of using it.

[Jessica] 09:25:01
We'll see back. Thanks for sharing. I think we're gonna shift on to our final topic that we want to talk about today.

[Jessica] 09:25:10
So. For this next step, I'm gonna share my screen with you and show you an example of some instructions that appear on the health care benefits application.

[Jessica] 09:25:19
And just ask you to explain in your own words and think a loud as your Reading and digesting this information.

[Jessica] 09:25:28
Okay, find the right screen. Okay, do you see my screen now?

[Jessica] 09:25:35
Let me know if you need me to zoom in or adjust or anything at all and I will but

[P20] 09:25:40
I mean, I see it I can, I can bring you it up. Closer to me.

[Jessica] 09:25:44
Okay, so yeah, could just take a minute to read through this and just remember to think aloud and explain in your own words.

[Jessica] 09:25:52
What these options mean to you?

[P20] 09:26:02
The Gulf and all right can't speak to this group.

[P20] 09:26:05
Okay.

[P20] 09:26:10
Pretty much if you're planning for full medical benefit packages,

[P20] 09:26:17
Pretty much telling you what you need to do. Which sections you need to fill out. And what's not required.

[P20] 09:26:37
It's just telling you, hey, if you wanna platform Medicaid coverage is what your VA pursuant should be.

[P20] 09:26:46
What you've had done and

[P20] 09:26:51
Pretty much just Seth Expant or what you need to do to apply for medical or full medical medical benefit package.

[Jessica] 09:27:02
If you were completing this application today, which one of these options would you select? Can you explain to me your thinking behind that?

[P20] 09:27:12
So you're saying if I get this screen, where would I go?

[Jessica] 09:27:16
Yeah, so kind of the type of benefits applying for is a pertains to health care. What one would you select and could you explain why?

[P20] 09:27:27
Oh, and the bottom. Oh, okay.

[P20] 09:27:43
What first do you have would have to out enroll in it. Then once I'm enrolled, get registered.

[P20] 09:27:50
Is that what you're stuck in your records?

[Jessica] 09:27:53
Got it. Yeah, that kind of your understanding of that. Instruction there? Okay.

[P20] 09:27:59
Yes, I would click on enroll.

[Jessica] 09:28:21
I guess as you're looking through this is there any of these instructions that you would need some? Electric clarity or explanation on that could help?

[P20] 09:28:28
Yeah, good on the Friday, 38 CFR. That's what I'm trying to figure out.

[Jessica] 09:28:35
Got it.

[P20] 09:28:36
Okay.

[P20] 09:28:40
Yeah, I would get stuck right there. I probably had to go Google another screen to see exactly what that means or find that actual.

[P20] 09:28:49
What read up on that to see what that is to see. If I'm eligible for enrollment.

[Jessica] 09:28:57
Okay.

[P20] 09:28:57
Which that should be in the package, right? I'm assuming.

[Jessica] 09:29:04
Okay, now that you've kind of seen this example of benefit kind of options, you were talking a lot about having a phone number to call of somebody to talk to and your ideal state.

[Jessica] 09:29:15
Would you change anything about your ideal state that we talked about right before this?

[P20] 09:29:21
No, I was still like on a phone number to call. It's not. Even though, it gives it to you like.

[P20] 09:29:30
My meaning or something in their meaning or something could be totally opposite. I like if I have question talking to a person.

[P20] 09:29:39
To get better clarity of any questions that I have.

[Jessica] 09:29:43
Got it. Thank you for that. Gonna stop sharing my screen now but is there anything else that you would like to add just about the health care?

[Jessica] 09:29:54
Benefit application process that were in the stuff we talked about today?

No, I just, I think it's an easy process if you just take the time to read it.

They're the ones that recruited you and set you all up for this study. And that'll include a little blurb you can pass along to other veterans.

[Jessica] 09:30:43
So they can provide them a chance to participate in future research studies as well.

[P20] 09:30:47
Okay, I was sure to pass it alone.
