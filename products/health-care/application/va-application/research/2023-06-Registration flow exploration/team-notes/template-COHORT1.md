# Conversation Guide for "registration only" mental model study [Health Enrollment Team, 10-10EZ, August 2023][Cohort 1 - Declined Enrollment]


*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Warm-up Questions  - 3 minutes

Letâ€™s start with a few warm-up questions.

- When was your last appointment at a VA Facility when you were seen for medical reasons? 



## First Topic: [Current Process - Facility Experience] - 5 minutes

- Can you please tell me about your experience getting setup for that first appointment at a VA facility?
- Can you describe your experience with any forms or sign up questions that you had to complete to be seen for care?
   - [Not saying your "registration experience, but would they have filled out a paper EZ in person or did staff input on their behalf?]
- What was your impression to what benefits or level of care you would qualify for as you were going through this process? 
- How would you describe the process after you were seen for care? 
   - Did you receive any communication from the VA or information if you were eligible to enroll in health care benefits? 


### Things to watch for:
- [What terminology does the Veteran use as they talk about their experience (enroll, register, priority groups, etc)?]
- [How does the Veteran portray the overall process - easy, difficult, uneventful?]
- [What pain points or areas of confusion are revealed?]
- [What things does a Veteran talk about in regards to the term registration?]


## Second Topic: [Choosing Benefits/Understanding Eligibility] - 10 minutes
- Can you explain to me, in your own words, the type of health care benefits that are available to you?
- What resources have you used to understand what health care benefits you might qualify for?
- Did you want to only get care for one specific health concern, or were you interested in enrolling in full health care coverage?
- Can you tell me more about anything that is unclear to you about the health care benefits eligibility and application process today? 


### Things to watch for:
- [How does the Veteran describe the process of figuring out what they are eligible for - are they frustrated, do they find it easy, do they just expect the VA to have the data and figure it out for them?]
- [Is there a mix or preference for wanting to be told what they get or search it out on their own?]
- [Is there any confusion about their benefits within the health care benefits they receive?]
- [Do they know and mention their Priority Group during these questions?]




## Third Topic: [Ideal State] - 10 minutes
- Could you describe how - in a perfect world - you would **want** the health care application process to go for you in regards to learning about benefit options and what you qualify for?
- What tools, communication, people could make this the best process possible in your mind?
- How would you like to discover all the options you have to get the level of care that is right for you?
- What information would be important to you so you feel confident when having to choose between health care benefit options?

### Things to watch for:
- [Are there any terminology used that stand out as the Veteran is describing their ideal process?]
- [What steps do they call out?]
- [What steps do they leave out?]
- [What do they mention or call out as information that is helpful in making decisions about health care benefit choices?]



## Fourth Topic: [Current paper instructions] - 10 minutes
- For this next topic, I am going to share my screen and show you an example of instructions that appear on the health care benefits application.
- Can you explain to me in your own words, what these options mean and how they are different?
- Which one would you select and can you explain to me your thinking behind that?
- Is there anything about these instructions that you find confusing or need more explanation before you could answer?


- [Link to Mural board for example](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1690928150976/0ce17c5b63ed3a2fd75736ac481d2d6e31fd927b?sender=uadf1ed7fe7c76f0914967329)

- Now that you have seen an example of choosing benefit options, would you change anything about your ideal state we just talked about right before this?
  

### Things to watch for:
- [What are the scenarios or examples given to why registration would be the preferred choice?]
- [Is selecting both options a common answer?]
- [What words and terms to participants use when they are explaining the differences?]
- [Is there often confusion to what to choose and what that means to them and their health care benefits?]
