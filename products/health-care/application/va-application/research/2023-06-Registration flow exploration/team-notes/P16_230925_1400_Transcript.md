00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:11.329
Hieu: Okay. So I have started recording, I want to confirm that you are comfortable. If I record my screen and audio as we talk today.

2
00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:20.850
Hieu: Okay, thank you. And then let's move on to the meat of this this chat here. We'll start off with a few warm up questions.

3
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:26.210
P16: Are you currently enrolled and using health care benefit from the Va. Yes.

4
00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.499
Hieu: okay. And then how often do you visit a Va facility?

5
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.140
P16:  lately it's almost been once a month.

6
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.929
Hieu: Okay, once a month. and then how often do you visit va gov

7
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.750
P16:  Probably about once a month or more to get to the messages.

9
00:00:52.060 --> 00:01:00.950
Hieu: I see, and then we'll move on to the next topic, which is the kind of the application process here.

10
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.669
Hieu: Can you explain to me in your own word the process you took when you apply for benefits.

11
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.370
P16: Oh, man, that's been a long time. Honestly, I don't remember what I what I did. All I know is, I got onto the to the website, and follow the the. You know, the prompts, the forms to that needed to be to be completed.

14
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:45.409
Hieu: and I can't explain more than that. Okay, and so this is a website application. Then, okay, so that means it's relatively, honestly recent. Do you have a rough year in?

15
00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.090
P16: I was about 2018, 2019.

17
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:51.790
Hieu: Okay. And then I know this is kind of really vague for you, and I'm kind of curious. If was there any part of that process that was frustrating or difficult for you, if you?

19
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.469
P16: No, but not that I can remember. Yeah, no.

21
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:18.310
Hieu: And then, from your recollection W. Was there like an amount of information you had you had to provide.

22
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.110
P16: or you don't recall.The only information I had provide was. My, you know, d 2, 14, and then medical records that pertain to what I was claiming.

25
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:34.630
Hieu: Hmm! So everything was, at least from what you read so far. What you recall is kind of straightforward, and you didn't really run into any hiccup. Okay, yeah, I did it myself. So you know, I didn't use someone else to

27
00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.600
P16: registration

28
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:56.720
Hieu: right right? And then when it comes to registering and healthcare at the V at the Va. What does that mean to you?

30
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:01.840
P16: No. What do you mean by registering like on the website, or just in general

32
00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.110
Hieu: registering for healthcare. So what does that mean to you?

33
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:22.579
P16:  and just make sure I'm covered. I mean, that's all reason why I did it. Make sure that I was able to.
P16: you know. Have the peace of mind for to be able to move forward with. You know, whatever
P16: that whatever issues I have going forward. Gotcha, making sure you have coverage.

37
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:44.440
Hieu: And then How did you determine what health benefit you could get when you completed the application

38
00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:59.119
P16: whenever I applied, I applied for for hearing, and and my shoulder, because those are the 2 main things that's bugged me. You know, Andrew, my shoulder while I was in, and then also being around, I was a helicopter mechanic. So, being around a lot of loud things, you know, have tendonitis and stuff like that. So so you have the reason why I applied the way I did. Yeah.

41
00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.570
Hieu: yeah. So you had things. And then you wanted to make sure you got coverage for that.

42
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:26.499
Hieu: And then what resources did you use, and how what resources did you use and how to understand what you might qualify for?

43
00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:39.289
P16:  basically, people from my unit talk to them about. You know who about the people who have already been enrolled and then they just told me you know what to look for and how to what I need to start the process to start the process. Sorry.

45
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:54.360
Hieu: Yeah. That's now you mentioned for, because if you're kind of involving the helicopter mechanic work. Was that kind of the only specific health concern that you're going for as you're applying for this? Or were you looking more for a full health kind of at the time. At at the time I mean, my goal was just to make sure I had the coverage for

48
00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:22.089
P16: for the service related. And then being able to have the the ability to be covered beyond. That was definitely a bonus. For myself.

49
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.620
Hieu: I gotcha. and then looking back. Now, after you've been through using kind of the health care benefit, was there anything you wish you have known during the application process.

51
00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:39.349
P16:  no, I can't really think of anything. and I mean, it's been a learning process on what what the Va. Can do and can't do. But I mean
P16: I don't think there's anything that II wish I knew when I applied. I think I had a pretty good idea of what was needing. needing me done.

56
00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:06.550
Hieu: And then you kind of mentioned trying to learn what the Va. Can and what can't do

57
00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:19.500
P16: can you expand on that? Yeah. I mean benefit. Wise. The community care. You know what what they can cover, what they can't. You know, more or less the the health
P16: the health insurance, you know, benefits.
P16:  yeah, I didn't. Whenever I applied I didn't realize that they could help me with glasses. So you know, that was one of those things wasn't something I was looking for. But you know it was a
P16: benefit that I was able to to get
P16: And then I mean, a couple of years ago I had had 2 strokes, and you know they've covered all of the testing and diagnosis. And you know all that since then.
P16: So you know, it's and then, you know, community care and and things like that.

63
00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:07.330
Hieu: Okay, that's good to hear. And then, like for your glasses, for example, was that something that was mentioned to you by another veteran? Or was that during your

64
00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:15.130
P16: care in the VA. that they mentioned they could cover that. It was whenever I first met got to my first primary
P16: they gave me a a sheet of what?
P16: What my benefits covered and that was on there, plus
P16: you know, audiology and and things like that, and
P16: so yeah, they've they've been able to The my primary team is one of the.
P16: you know. If if I run into something they're like, oh, wait! You can do this, and you know they've been. They've been good with that.

70
00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:53.830
Hieu: I see. Now can you explain to me in your own word what you get with your Va healthcare benefits.

71
00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.030
P16:  I mean what I've
P16: utilize, so far as you know, community care be able to go
P16: outside of a via clinic or or doctor, and get seen  again. The you know glasses be able to get the exams done, and
P16: get new glasses as I need them.
P16:  And I've the past couple of years. I've
P16: gone to many different places, get blood draws and things like that. So I mean everything that I've I've had has been covered so far.
P16: And and I haven't had any complaints with with what I've gone through.

79
00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:58.499
Hieu: Okay. Now, you initially mentioned that through your other kind of other veterans that you initially found to apply for the Va healthcare. What health or additional resources did you rely on to help you figure all this out?

80
00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:04.600
P16:  I mean one of my main friends that in my unit.
P16: and he's the one that
P16: got me started on, you know. Gave me the list of, you know. Make sure you get your your health records. In line. Get get your the 14 set up. And then it told me, you know what? You know the website to go onto. And
P16: basically, you know what link to hit to to get started. And then
P16: after that, I just followed the prompts on the the forms. I didn't
P16: you know I did it?
P16: Not my house away from everyone. So you know, whenever I did it, there was no one guiding me through it. I just read and
P16: moved on.

88
00:09:53.600 --> 00:10:04.610
Hieu: I see so initially, it's your friend or colleague or someone. And then, once you, you're in the application, you're just using it and reading through that

89
00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:12.440
Hieu:  can you tell me more about what priority group you are in for your health care benefit now.

90
00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:14.380
P16: what? What? I'm sorry.

91
00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:18.419
Hieu: What priority group you are in for your

92
00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:21.550
P16: healthcare benefit. Honestly, I'm not sure.

93
00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:27.799
Hieu: Okay. And then, if you're not sure, what do you think priority groups are.
Hieu: There's no right or wrong answer here, and then just explain your understanding of what you think it could be, and how that's important to healthcare benefit.

95
00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:40.459
P16: Oh, I wouldn't have an idea. I mean.
P16: the only thing I can think of is. you know, kind of like a triage is, you know, who is
P16: secret, you know, who who has the most more issues, versus least amount, or or whatever
P16: But

99
00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:14.619
Hieu: could you describe in a perfect world. You would want the healthcare.
Hieu: or I guess.
Hieu: could you describe how you would want the healthcare application process to go for you in regards to learning about the benefit option and what you would qualified for.

102
00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:31.939
P16:  I know, reading a lot of the
P16: trying to learn more about it. Some of it is
P16: It kind of over my head with some of the descriptions and things like that. So I think of some folks
P16: simplified terms would be better but
P16: other than that, I mean.
P16: once I started getting into it, and the more I've learned about it, it's pretty straightforward, but you know I had to get to that point of learning the terminology and and things.

108
00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:15.340
Hieu: So there is more of a learning curve, and you wish things are more of in plain language, or you know, layman language. Okay?
Hieu: And then how would you want to learn about how to use your benefit that you're eligible for

110
00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:29.740
P16:  I think you know on the website. If you log into your account, you have a
P16: a list of
P16: of everything you're you're eligible for you know, because without that piece of paper that my primary gave me.
P16: I wouldn't own about.
P16: you know my glasses. Let's say, you know, you know, I wish there was a section like on the dashboard that says,
P16: all benefits
P16:  not required. That's wrong word I'm looking for, but you know what eligible for and and then you know, you can put in your
P16: your your home address, and it shows
P16: you the the closest location to
P16: be able to receive those or like. One thing is, I have a medical id bracelet
P16: and you know my primary didn't know that they could ask for it through prosthetics. But you know I had to do the research I told them asked them about it. They're like, well, I can see what I can do, and you know I was able to get it through prosthetics. But you know I happen to stumble on
P16: belong that cause? My brother was
P16: looking for one for himself and
P16: While I was doing research for him, I found one from you know, I found that the Via covered it.
P16: So you know, having a centralized.
P16: This is what you can.
P16: you know, even just a general. You know you have glasses coverage. You have
P16: audiology you have, you know.
P16: you know, whatever, and then you can go into it, and then, you know, break it down.
P16: This is what is covered, you know.

130
00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:33.670
Hieu: Okay, it. It sounds like you wanted 2 things in terms of on your dashboard. You want essentially a list that's personalized to to what you qualified for, and then the other one is kind of the like a facility locator that's allows to locate facilities near you that you can go to right, which I mean would be nice to have it on that same dashboard, as you know the the

132
00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:57.580
P16: phone numbers or or, you know a way to find the clip, the the closest one for that specific  benefit, you know.

133
00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:05.349
Hieu: And then what tool communication people could make this the best possible process for you.

134
00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:19.350
P16: You know I use the the app on my my phone a lot especially for the secure messaging. So you know, even just having a a tab on there that says
P16: you know your personalized benefits, or you know whatever
or if I go onto Va, Gov,
P16: have a tab there. That shows, you know, personalized benefits or whatever. And then the phone numbers that I can call to to
P16: Get a hold of someone to, you know. Get more information, or or a link to, you know. Show
P16: the address, or you know, whatever stuff like that.

140
00:15:48.120 --> 00:16:05.700
Hieu: right? So it's your app or the website that gives you the list that you want. I got you and then points you to some more detail instructions or information if needed. Okay? And then how would you like to discover what options you have to get to the level of care? That's right for you.

142
00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:16.149
P16:  really, I think it boils down to that. You know the the personalized benefit
P16: you know. List.
P16:  you know, whenever I had my strokes. I went to the ER. In Victoria, Texas.
P16:  And then they transferred me over to Audi Murphy in San Antonio and
P16:  you know I
P16: didn't know that that was something that was able to be done, or or you know anything like that. So
P16: you know, just having little bit of. and and it really boils down just having more of a a concise
P16: of this is what
P16: you know what you can
P16: what is offered to you to you as a veteran, or or you personally.

152
00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:12.870
Hieu: Right? So a lot of it. It's the offering and making sure it's a qualification or eligibility for it eligible for it. Okay? And then what information would be important to you? So you feel confident when, having to choose between the healthcare benefit options.

154
00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:34.370
P16:  you know, like I use, I utilize a lot of the community care.
P16: So being able to find
P16: I guess, in network community, you know, care, provider that that I can look look at before
P16: my referral goes over to me to community care. And then them saying, Oh, look! I found this
P16: this doctor for you, and I've never heard of them before. Well, you know.
P16: I would have been able to do research if I had some type of way to know. you know, who accepts. You know the Try West, or whatever

160
00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:13.050
Hieu: I see that primary or that personal research that you want, or at least some way of knowing what they cover. It's important to you. Okay, got that. And then for this next topic, I'm gonna share my screen and kind of show you an example of instructions that appear in healthcare benefit application. So give me a minute here while I bring that up.

163
00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:55.730
Hieu: Okay, can you see my screen? Yeah.
Hieu: okay. Now, can you explain to me in your own word what these options mean and how they are different?
165
Hieu: So and then go ahead and kind of
Hieu: talk about your thoughts, and just have you know your thoughts out loud.

167
00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:20.619
P16: Give me a slow reader.

168
00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:23.319
Hieu: that's fine. Take your time.

169
00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:32.520
P16: Okay, so it's talking about full medical.
P16: And what are you want me to to say about it? And I'm sorry.

171
00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:50.719
Hieu: Can you kind of explain to me in your own word what these options mean, and how are they different?

172
00:19:54.330 --> 00:20:03.210
P16:  I'm not sure what you mean different than from what I have or what?

173
00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:12.029
Hieu: So we're only concentrating on kind of this instruction. And then in this instruction, they have kind of 2
Hieu: benefits.

175
00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:18.609
P16: one, it's enrollment and the other. It's registration.
P16:  wasn't exactly sure.
P16:  it! It looks like
P16: I mean to me it just looks like
P16: one is
P16: you have? Well, I mean, it says full medical benefits. Another one is
P16: You only get benefits if you are. have particular a
P16: qualifications.
P16:  but I mean the way this is the the way it's worded enrollment versus registration. It looked like it was
P16: To me it looked like it was the same thing. I didn't realize it was 2 different
P16: you know.
P16: one is enrollment. And then this is what you are. This is what  and
P16: what you need to register is the way it it read to me.

188
00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:32.640
Hieu: I gotcha.
Hieu: And then which one would you select? And can you explain to me your thinking behind that?

190
00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:49.520
P16:  I mean, if I had to choose the
P16: you know
P16: one or the other, I would.
P16: without seeing this, you know, ever before I would do enrollment, not knowing, realizing that it was 2 2 different
P16: types. Because, you know.
P16: one is you're trying to enroll the other one is your your registration registering for for something, you know.
P16: It just like, I said, assuming it. It doesn't
P16: seem like it's 2 different coverages.

198
00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:31.020
Hieu: Gotcha. And then is there anything about these instructions that
Hieu: you find confusing or neat explanation before you could answer.

200
00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:43.049
P16: Well, I mean, like, I said. You know. enrollment and registration it just it. And

201
00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:52.360
P16: you know, to me enrollment is, you know, you're enrolling for something, and then you register. You register for it.

202
00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:55.259
P16: You know it. It doesn't
P16: it? Just it looks the same. I didn't. I didn't realize it was 2 different ones. That's why I was really confused when when you asked

204
00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:16.689
Hieu: now that you've seen an example of choosing benefit options, what will you would you change anything about your ideal state that we just talked about right before this.

205
00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:24.700
P16:  I mean
P16: knowing that is 2 different ones. You know. II would go for registration, because that's what I would think. I would qualify for more than
P16: the full medical. But I mean.
P16: I'm still confused as to how it's 2 different different things.
P16: But you're not confidently choosing one or the other. Right? Yeah, no, I by just this little form. I couldn't
P16: be confident about it at all.

211
00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:59.280
Hieu: And then what you think would make you more confident in in that
Hieu: in that choice.

213
00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:12.569
P16:  I mean, it shows, you know, as specific. The eligibility criteria specified at
P16: the Cfr. Well.
P16: I wouldn't know where to go to find that now, unless if I,
P16: you know. had to go search it.
P16: I mean, I think it should have
P16: more of a you know you have 2 different explaining that you have enrollment.
P16: And then the little blurb for the you know the 17 point 3 6,
P16: and then you know a little and then explain what the registration is. And with the 17.3 7
P16:  on there, I mean.

222
00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:57.579
Hieu: okay, so you, you essentially want, like an easy
Hieu: blur or an easy way for you to get to that information and kind of

224
00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:06.120
P16: okay, I got you.

225
00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:10.800
Hieu: And I think that pretty much.
Hieu: Let me stop sharing here.
Hieu: Think that pretty much, concludes the
Hieu: our session. Is there anything else you would like to add?
Hieu: to what we talked about today.

230
00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:33.639
P16: No, no, I can't think of anything. Ii just really. I just think that it.
P16: You know, I know not. Everyone has the same benefits that you know your dashboard should show. This is what you are qualified for under. You know your your percentage
P16: and then and then, whenever you know, like what you just showed me, is it? Have it where it spells it out a little bit better than
P16: then.
P16: you know. Are you gonna enroll or register to me. Those are pretty much the same word. So I wouldn't know what the difference is
P16: completely understandable. And then, do you have any questions from me? No, no, I'm I think I'm good.
