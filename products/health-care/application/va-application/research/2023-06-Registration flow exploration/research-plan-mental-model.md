# Research Plan for "registration only" mental model hypothesis flow study [Health Enrollment Team, 10-10EZ, June 2023]

## Background
The online health care application today processes all applications as enrollment. With regards to regulation § 17.37 Enrollment not required—provision of hospital and outpatient care to veterans which is being called the "registration only" path. This has a mix of eligibility criteria or scenarios for the Veteran to meet and a mix of what type of benefits they would be receiving - ranging from care for one need to the "full medical benefits package". 

How might we enable Veterans who simply want to "register" for a specific level of care — up to and including the full medical benefits package — do that instead of processing all applications as enrollment applications?

### OCTO Priorities 

Which [OCTO priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202023.md) does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.

- Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience
- Fast-track disability claims, starting with PACT Act claims 


### Veteran Journey
- This fits accross the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) from getting out to aging.
- This impacts a **key moment that matters** in that Veterans need to select the health care coverage according to their individual needs and preferences and that is the best fit for them. 


## Research Goals	

Learn if Veterans who have recently started receiving health care benefits are aware of the terms and difference between registration and enrollment as it pertains to them and the process to getting the level the care they want/need.

Learn more about Veteran's mental model when applying for health care benefits and the terms they use (apply, enroll, register, etc) and how they see levels of care and Priority Groups impacting them during the health care application process.

Learn more about how Veterans would like to go about applying, discovering eligibility and getting the most health care benefits they qualify for and what amount of informationt they need to provide in that process. 


### Outcome
We will use these findings to:
- Gain more understanding of the current problem space and Veteran's perception of registration and enrollment
- Check assumptions and terminology used to remain Veteran-centric 
- Develop insights into an ideal state and how Veteran would prefer to navigation the health care benefits application journey
- Guide our direction in creating the registration flow by iterating on potential hypothesis flows prior to creating a prototype

### Research questions

Out goal is to learn if Veterans who have recently started receiving health care benefits are aware of the terms and difference between registration and enrollment as it pertains to them.
- What is the experience of "registering only" today? 
- How does the regulation "§ 17.37 - Enrollment not required—provision of hospital and outpatient care to veterans" impact Veterans when applying for health care?

Learn more about Veteran's mental model when applying for health care benefits and the terms they use (apply, enroll, register, etc) and how they see levels of care and Priority Groups impacting them during the health care application process.
- What is the Veteran's mental model of discovering, getting and keeping health care benefits as they go through the application process?
- What is the Veterans perception of eligibility and Priority Groups when they are completing the application?

Learn more about how Veterans would like to go about applying, discovering eligibility and getting the most health care benefits they qualify for.
- What are the Veteran's current pain points with how the health care application impacts the overall benefits journey?
- What is the order and process expectations of Veterans when they are applying (registering or enrolling) for health care benefits?
- When does it make sense to Veterans to go thorugh eligibiltiy based questions? (before, during or after application)


### Hypothesis
- We assume that Veterans will not use the term "registration only" when referring to health care benefits but will be familiar with enrollment and eligibility.
- We assume that Veterans will use the term registration when they are talking about choosing their main VA medical facility for care. 
- We assume the overall process of determining eligibility and being placed in a Priority Group is somewhat unclear to Veterans today.
- We assume adding the term/step of "registration" will add to the confusion around health care benefits. 
- We assume not all Veterans go through the enrollment process in one go, there is often stops, such as an exam and other claims filed in between. 

## Methodology	
- Semi-structured interviews - appropriate for generative research



Additional desk research will be conducted to supplement these interviews:
- Google analytics path and keyword study
- VSignals analysis around keywords


### Location
Remote via Zoom for the interviews

### Research materials
*Note: your OCTO/VA lead must review and approve all research materials – including this plan –  prior to submitting a recruitment request.*

## Recruitment	

OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers. 

Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources. 
- [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/recruiting-participants) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research. 
- [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.

### Recruitment approach

Our intended audience for this reasearch are Veterans and we will be using and leveraging Perigean to recruit participants.


### Recruitment criteria
List the total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study. 

**15 completed sessions; 5 completed per cohort**

21 requested; 7 requested per cohort


**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study? 


**Screener Questions**
Cohort 1: 
- Have you visited a VA facility for a medical visit/exam in the past year and did not enroll in health care benefits package? [answer should be yes to qualify.]

Cohorts 2 & 3:
- Have you applied within the past 3 years and are now enrolled in health care? [answer should be yes to qualify.]




**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
What criteria would strengthen your results? 


- At least 9 participants are female

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. *Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.* 

Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
