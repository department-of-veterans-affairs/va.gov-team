## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them... 

Today we're going to talk about the health care application process.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about [half an hour].** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You'll be compensated no matter how much of the session we complete.** 
- Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I want to be sure before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - If yes: Admit observers. 
    - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)
   - Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth
- **Are you comfortable if I record my audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 


## Warm-up Questions  - 5 minutes

Letâ€™s start with a few warm-up questions.

- Are you currently enrolled and using health care benefits from the VA? 
- How long have you been receiving medical care from the VA? 
- How often do you visit a VA facility? (if answered yes)
- Do you regularly visit VA.gov?
- Do you receive other benefits from the VA in addition to your medical benefits?


## First Topic: [Current Process] - 10 minutes

- Can you explain to me in your own words the process you took when you applied for benefits?
- [If they don't specify] Did you complete this online, in-person or via paper application by yourself?
- Anything that stood out to you?
- Was there any part of that process that was frustrating or difficult for you?
- What is your recollection about the amount of information you had to provide?
- Was it clear to you as you were applying, what benefits you would qualify for? 
- How would you describe the process that happened after you applied, such as the communications from the VA, things you had to do, etc.?
- Was it clear to you how your application answers impacted your benefits?
- When it comes to registering and health care at the VA, what does that mean to you?


### Things to watch for:
- [What terminology does the Veteran use as they talk about their experience (enroll, register, priority groups, etc)?]
- [How does the Veteran portray the overall process - easy, difficult, uneventful?]
- [What pain points or areas of confusion are revealed?]
- [What things does a Veteran talk about in regards to the term registration? VA Facilities?]


## Second Topic: [Getting Benefits/Eligibility] - 10 minutes

- How did you determine what health benefits you could get when you recently applied or were seen for care?
- Did anyone help you figure out what you qualify for and what your benefits included?
- What resources do you use to understand what you might qualify for?
- Did you want to only get care for one specific health concern, or were you interested in getting full health care coverage?
- Looking back now after you have been using health care benefits, is there anything you wish you would have known during the application?

### Things to watch for:
- [How does the Veteran descirbe the process of figuring out what they are eligble for - are they frustrated, do they find it easy, do they just expect the VA to have the data and figure it out for them?]
- [Is there a mix or preference for wanting to be told what they get or search it out on their own?]
- [Is there any confusion about their benefits within the health care benefits they recieve?]
- [Do they know and mention their Priority Group during these questions?]


## Third Topic: [Ideal State] - 10 minutes
- Could you describe how - in a perfect world - you would **want** the health care application process to go for you? From learning what you qualify for, applying and using your benefits. 
- What tools, communication, people could make this the best process possible in your mind?
- How would you like to discover what options you have to get the level of care that is right for you?
- What information would be important to you so you feel confident when having to choose between health care benefit options?


### Things to watch for:
- [Are there any terminology used that stand out as the Veteran is describing their ideal process?]
- [What steps do they call out?]
- [What steps do they leave out?]
- [What do they mention or call out as information that is helpful in making decisions about health care benefit choices?]


## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

- Out of the 2 scenarios that were talked through with you, what one would you prefer out of those and why?
- Is there anything else you would like to add about what we talked about today?
- Any questions for me? 


## Thank-You and Closing - 3 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
