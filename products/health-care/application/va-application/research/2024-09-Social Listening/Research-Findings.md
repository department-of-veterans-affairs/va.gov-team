## Research Goals
Healthcare updates, especially regarding financial information, are a critical touchpoint in a veteran’s health journey, as they help the VA determine if the veteran is eligible for travel pay reimbursement and whether copays are required for non-service-connected care or prescription medicines.

The online Health Care Benefit Update form (10-10EZR) is available, but there is currently no notification system in place to inform Veterans about updates. This raises key questions: Who should be notified? When should we notify them? How often should notifications be sent out? Moreover, how should we categorize Veterans for these notifications? Should we group them by Priority Group, by Disability Rating, or by other factors?

To address these challenges, we took a step back to analyze user-generated content (UGC) from social media. By examining real-world experiences shared by veterans and healthcare users, we aim to gain insight into their expectations, pain points, and preferences regarding notifications. This approach allows us to:
 - Goal 1: Understand how Veterans currently perceive their healthcare journey, especially in terms of financial information.
 - Goal 2: Identify frustrations or gaps in communication that could help us shape more effective notification strategies.
 - Goal 3: Determine patterns that may help us decide how to group Veterans for tailored notifications (e.g., by disability status, healthcare needs, or personal preferences).

## Research Questions

**Goal 1: Understand how Veterans currently perceive their healthcare journey, especially in terms of financial information.**
- How much do Veterans associate income with priority groups (and by extension, the covered care they can receive at VA)?
- How do Veterans perceive the financial-related information provided by the VA (Copayment, travel reimbursement)? 

**Goal 2: Identify frustrations or gaps in communication that could help us shape more effective notification strategies.**
- When do Veterans want to know about insurance and eligibility? Are our assumptions wrong?
- What do Veterans identify as their main frustration with the current notification system (timing, clarity, frequency)? 

**Goal 3: Determine patterns that may help us decide how to group Veterans for tailored notifications (e.g., by disability status, healthcare needs, or personal**
- Do Veterans know which life events necessitate updating their information through the EZR form, and if so, which life events?
- Do Veterans understand why they need to update their information on a (semi)regular basis to maintain their eligibility?

## Methodology 

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

** We assume...Veterans do not fully understand how financial information, such as income, impacts their eligibility for benefits, including Priority Groups and covered care.**
- Definitely true
- Text

** We assume...the current method of notifications about insurance, reliability, and billing updates do not align with Veterans' preference, leading to confusion and frustration.**
- Somewhat true
- Text

** We assume...Veterans are unclear about which life events or changes require them to update their information, resulting in infrequent updates.**
- Somewhat true
- Text

_("Maybe True", “Likely True”, “Definitely True”, “Likely False”, “Definitely False” or “Not enough information”) Why?_


## Key Findings

_The 5-10 top findings from your study should be listed here. Write your findings so that if someone reads only these bullets they can leave feeling they got useful information and the study was worthwhile. Examples might be "Most participants used the Search field to find the form, and searched for the term 'veteran health'" or "Most participants struggled with the secondary caregiver section on the form"._

1. Finding one - When Veterans are in a transitional phase such as job change, health change, or retirement, they are very proactive in seeking guidance and support for their healthcare
2. Finding two - Veterans do not associate their Priority Group with VA healthcare.

3. Finding three - A common concern was that giving VHA information about their employer's health insurance plan would remove their eligibility for VA healthcare.
[Hieu Note; Alternatively finding: Veterans frequently compare private healthcare with VA services, seeking to understand which provides better or more comprehensive coverage.]

4. Finding four - Many Veterans' first impression of the VA is through informal sources (word-of-mouth or third party).

5. Finding five

6. Finding six

7. Finding seven


## Details of Findings 

_For each finding, list details with supporting quotes and images when possible. Please **add relevant keywords/labels to your findings** selected from the [research repository label list](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/labels?page=1&sort=name-asc). Adding keywords/labels to your findings will help others find research relevant to their work._

**Finding 1: When Veterans are in a transitional phase such as job change, health change, or retirement, they are very proactive in seeking guidance and support for their healthcare.**
- 43% (69 of 159) entries would be within the “Taking Care of Myself” stage of the Veteran Journey.
- 43% (68 of 159) entries had questions about health insurance.
- 40% (63 of 159) entries had questions about miscellaneous VA Benefits including travel reimbursements, appointments, community care, and medication.  
- 15% (25 of 159) entries would be within the “Starting Up” stage of the Veteran Journey
- 11% (18 of 159) entries would be within the “Putting Down Roots” stage of the Veteran Journey.

**Finding 2: Veterans do not associate their Priority Group with VA healthcare.**
- 83% (132 of 159) of posts mentioned disability rating.
- 36% (57 of 159) of posts mentioned a service-connected disability but did not specify a rating.
- Only 11 posts explicitly mentioned priority groups. Of those, 3 mentioned a specific PG, and only 1 Veteran confidently knew what their PG# was.
- Based on references to service-connected disability ratings alone, 39% of Veterans posting on Reddit are in Priority Group 1.

**Finding 3: A common concern was that giving VHA information about their employer's health insurance plan would remove their eligibility for VA healthcare.**
 - 43% (68 of 159) entries had questions about health insurance.
 - 55 of 68 posts wanted to understand covered care at VHA in relation to their health insurance (13 TRICARE, 1 ACA, 41 employer or private health insurance plan)
 - 12 of 68 explicitly wanted to understand the difference between health insurance and VA healthcare
 - 12 of 68 wanted to know if they were eligible to receive any healthcare at VA



## Additional Insights

**Additional Finding 1: Veterans struggle to understand whether their dependents (spouse, children) are eligible for VA healthcare benefits. Many assume certain disability ratings automatically extend coverage to their family.**
- 12% (19 of 159) posts had questions about dependent care and beneficiary benefits.
- 17 of 19 of those posts are CHAMPVA-related, seeking guidance and clarification.

**Additional Finding 2: Harmful experience; Difficulty in traveling to VA facilities is a recurring issue for a number of Veterans, particularly for those living far from VA centers or in rural areas.**
 - There are 8 entries regarding travel reimbursements
- At least 4 of those entries had a negative experience trying to receive care due to their struggling with getting transportation the the treatment facility or navigating the travel reimbursement system.


**Additional Finding 3: Harmful experience; A common concern involves veterans encountering unexpected bills or co-pays, even after receiving care through the VA.**
- 10 entries sought clarity over copay and how the VA coverage impacts them.
- At least 4 of those entries had a negative experience, expressing confusion and frustration with receiving unexpected bills/ copay charges and then struggling to navigate the VA website for relevant information.
