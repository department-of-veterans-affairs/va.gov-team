## **Background**

The online health care application (VA Form 10-10EZ) and the update form (VA Form 10-10EZR) can both impact a Veteran's eligibility and placement when applying for and managing their health care benefits. This is moreso impactful for those placed in a [Priority Group](https://www.va.gov/health-care/eligibility/priority-groups/) who need to report additional income information to be considered for copay and travel reimbursement in addition to their basic eligibility. The 10-10EZ is the initial application that places a Veteran in a Priority group for enrollment into the full medical benefits package. The 10-10EZR is used to provide personal, financial or insurance information updates after enrollment.

The outcome of this exploratory research study will aid in further understanding how Veterans comprehend their eligibility for health care benefits as it pertains to applying for and maintaining those benefits.

### **OCTO Priorities**

This research supports OCTO-DE's 2024 priorities, specifically [objective 1](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202024.md): to make digital experiences the best way to access VA health care and benefits.

Data collected from this study will contribute to designing an updated process for applying for and maintaining eligibility for medical benefits that can be easily understood and managed online.


### **Veteran Journey** 

The 10-10EZ and 10-10EZR fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) any time between getting out and dying, as a Veteran could be applying for and updating their information to maintain medical benefits around any milestone or change in life circumstances.

Special attention has been paid to Starting Up, Taking Care of Myself and Putting Down Roots sections within the Veteran journey in this study.


## **Research Goals**

Health care updates, especially regarding financial information, are a critical touchpoint in a Veteran's health journey, as they determine a Veteran's deligibility for receiving non-service-connected care at VA facilities, as well as other health care benefits.

The online Health Care Benefit Update form (VA 10-10EZR) is vailable, but currently there is no notification system in place online to inform the Veteran about when to update their information and why that information is important to keep current. This raises key questions: Who should be notified? When should we notify them? How often should notifications be sent out? Moreover, [how should be categorize Veterans for these notifications](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1698266698151/d82092b38107a883cc3975d9ea21deaf4fb0739a?sender=u503219bf4e47eab9c75d3838)? Should we group them by Priority Group, by Disability Rating, or by other eligibility factors?

To address these questions, we propose taking a step back to analyze online user-generated content (UGC). By examining real-world experiences and questions shared by Veterans and other VA health care users, we aim to gain insight into their expectations, pain points, and preferences regarding notifications. This approach allows us to:
- Goal 1: Understand how Veterans currently perceive their health care journey, especially in terms of financial eligibility
- Goal 2: Identify frustrations or gaps in VA-Veteran communication that could help us shape more effective notification strategies
- Goal 3: Determine patterns that may help us decide how to group Veterans for tailored notifications (e.g., by disability rating, health care needs, or personal preferences)


## **Research Questions**

**Goal 1: Understand how Veterans currently perceive their health care journey, especially in terms of financial eligibility**
1. How much do Veterans associate income with Priority Groups, and by extension, the covered care they can expect to receive at VA?
2. How do Veterans perceive the financial-related information provided by the VA, such as copays and travel reimbursement?

**Goal 2: Identfy frustrations or gaps in VA-Veteran communication that could help us shape more effective notification strategies**
1. When do Veterans want to know about insurance and eligibility? Are our assumptions wrong?
2. What do Veterans identify as their main frustrations with the current notification system (e.g., timing, clarity, or frequency)?

**Goal 3: Determine patterns that may help us decide how to group Veterans for tailored notifications (e.g., by disability rating, health care needs, or personal preferences)**
1. Do Veterans know which life events necessitate updaitng their information through the 10-10EZR form, and if so, which life events?
2. Do Veterans understand why they need to update their information on a (semi)regular basis to maintain their eligibility?


## **Methodology**

We collected and analyzed [user generated content](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/user-generated-content) (UGC) from public, Veteran-centered communities on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/).


### **Research materials**

- Link to user generated content analysis ([Mural) ](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1726532865198/888111d9429b3f4a0c1ad8ac8287dffcf09a7682?sender=u503219bf4e47eab9c75d3838)


### **Data sampling**

We conducted a multi-step process to identify and ethically collect posts from Veteran-centered subreddits related to VA medical benefits. 


#### Why Reddit?

- **Targeted search results**

Google search results have become less and less accurate and reliable over time, for a number of reasons, from the proliferation of ads, to SEO-optimized junk sites, to AI generated content (src: [1](https://dkb.blog/p/google-search-is-dying)). Users find Reddit recommendations useful, and increasingly are appending “Reddit” to their search criteria to specifically seek out content on the platform (src: [2](https://www.fastcompany.com/90722739/is-reddit-a-better-search-engine-than-google), [3](https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/expanded-reddit-partnership/)).

- **Trust**

Past research has shown that Veterans feel more comfortable seeking peer support to navigate VA experiences. VA.gov content is thought to be outdated, inaccurate, or misleading. Veteran-centered subreddits are some of the largest and most active communities on the platform: [r/VeteransBenefits](https://www.reddit.com/r/VeteransBenefits/) is in the Top 1%, and [r/VeteransAffairs](https://www.reddit.com/r/VeteransAffairs/) the top 10% by size, respectively. These and other Veteran-centered subreddits have developed resources specifically for individuals seeking assistance with understanding service-connected disability benefits and health care.


#### Data collection

1. We conducted an initial Reddit search (“VA healthcare”), limiting our search to posts from between 2020 and September, 2024. Based on this search, we will limit our data collection to posts from the following subreddits:
   
        - r/VeteransBenefits
   
        - r/VeteransAffairs
   
        - r/Veterans
   
        - r/Medicare
   
        - r/navyreserve
   
        - r/VeteranWomen
   
        - r/Military
   
        - r/navy

3. In addition to collecting any posts that corresponded to our broach search, some subreddits use tags to organize posts by content type. We will add posts from the following communities with these tags:
   
        - r/VeteransBenefits + “Health Care”
   
        - r/VeteransAffairs + “VHA”
   
        - r/VeteransAffairs + “Veterans Health Administration”
   
        - r/VeteransAffairs + “Insurance”
   
        - r/Veterans + “Health Care”

5. We manually created a spreadsheet with our initial collection of Reddit posts, removing identifiable information (URLs, usernames) and any data that was not relevant to the goals of this study. 

**In total, we found 159 posts related to our search criteria**. This spreadsheet will be destroyed at the conclusion of the study, in accordance with ethical data collection guidelines.


### **Data analysis**

Qualitative analysis was conducted using multiple approaches. Inter-researcher agreement was determined for each level of coding and analysis.


#### Thematic analysis
The goal of this analysis was to identify thematic areas of  inquiry, both within the 10-10 product group, but with the entire VA health care experience.

- **Level 1 analysis**: We began with defining several preliminary themes: service-connected disability, financial information, income, and health insurance. We assumed based on the topic and keyword searches that these themes would occur frequently in the dataset. EAch post was then tagged by preliminary theme(s), sentiment, keywords, and stages within the Veteran journey.
     - Posts were tagged for sentiment included positive, negative, confusion and misinformation.
          - **Misinformation** refers to posts where the user had made a determination or decision within their journey based on incorrect information.
          - **Confusion** refers to someone who came to post a question where the replies would be a data point in assisting the user with making a decision in their journey.

- **Level 2 analysis**: We created a codebook in a new tab of the spreadsheet, tying keywords to theme codes and defining what fit (and what didn’t) for each theme.
     - Then, we went back through the dataset to update L1 and L2 tags as well as the user journey.
     - We swapped sections of the dataset from L1 analysis for inter-operator agreement, and met regularly to ensure that each researcher adhered to the definitions within the codebook.


#### Narrative analysis
The goal of this analysis was to look for areas of common confusion or misinformation, crucial decision points within the health care journey, and gaps in support or harms that Veterans experienced.
- We added key themes and codes to a Mural, tying place/time-based actions to sentiment and direction. Based on the thematic analysis, we chose to conduct this analysis for the 4 themes with the most data and salience to the 10-10 product. These included:
     - Health insurance
     - Dependent care
     - Financial information
     - Other VA benefits
- For each theme, we added the code and its most closely associated keywords with a chart mapping the Veteran journey.
     - X-axis defined by sentiment, y-axis defined by stages within the Veteran user journey.

Once findings were established, we calculated the frequency of findings for the dataset. 

## **Hypotheses and Conclusions**

**1. Veterans do not fully understand how financial information, such as income, impacts their eligibility for benefits, including [Priority Group](https://www.va.gov/health-care/eligibility/priority-groups/) rating and covered care (Goal 1: Q1)**

- **DEFINITELY TRUE:** Only 7% (11 of 159) of posts mentioned Priority Groups. Of those posts, 3 cited a specific PG#, and only 1 confidently knew what their PG# was. By contrast, 83% (132 of 159) of posts analyzed mentioned a service-connected disability rating. Based on disclosure of service-connected disability rating alone, 39% (62 of 159) of posts analyzed were from Veterans in Priority Group 1. Many cited a fear that seeking care for the “wrong” conditions, or going to the wrong facility, would potentially impact their rating and future covered care.



**2. The current method of notifications about insurance, reliability, and billing updates do not align with Veterans’ preferences, leading to confusion and frustration (Goal 2: Q1/2)**

- **LIKELY TRUE:** Veterans who received letters from VA to update their financial information expressed confusion about the letters and shared their negative experiences.



**3. Veterans are unclear about which life events or changes to their circumstances require them to update their information using the 10-10EZR, resulting in infrequent updates that could negatively affect the continuity of care they receive (Goal 3: Q1/2)**

- **LIKELY TRUE:** Veterans experiencing a life change did not know where to go to update their information, or which events would necessitate updating. We did observe that Veterans are worried about losing their disability rating or suddenly losing their health care, and are proactive to understand what they need to do and what their options are. Additional research is required to understand how to provide that information to Veterans. 


## **Key Findings**

1. Few Veterans understand the role that income plays in their VA health care eligibility. 

2. Veterans want to verify their eligibility for covered care prior to enrollment and updating their information to avoid surprises.

3. The current notification system does not meet Veterans’ current mental models or information needs.

4. When Veterans are in a transitional period, such as a job change, a health change, or retirement, they are proactive in seeking guidance and support for their health care.


## **Details of Findings**

**Finding 1: Few Veterans understand the role that income plays in their VA health care eligibility. (Goal 1: Q1)** 

- Compared to the high rate of posts about service-connected disability ratings and covered care, only 7% of posts (11 of 159) had questions about income limits for accessing VA health care. Though this sample was small, two themes emerged in Veterans’ posts:

  - The most common (6 of 11 posts) keywords associated with income limits were “unemployment” and “limited/low income.” These individuals were either denied VA health care after applying and attributed the denial to their income, or had a change in circumstances that meant they no longer could afford VA copays or their health insurance premiums. These individuals were not aware they could apply for hardship or update their financial information with VA to demonstrate a change in their income.

     _“It’s bonkers to me, the income requirements to be able to get coverage. If you’re a Veteran of the military, you should be able to have some sort of coverage, period. I love how everyone talks up how great the VA is, and yet they literally only help Veterans with a disability – everyone else who served, be damned.”_
     
     _–_
     
     _\[I]s there an income threshold for VA health care with 100%\[?] I see there is an income threshold for lesser percentages, but nothing for my case (or maybe I just missed it)._

- 3 of 11 posts cited getting a new job or having a change in income that meant they no longer met the income limits to qualify for VA health care. None of these posts mentioned the Veteran’s PG# or an awareness of how location impacts income limits. There was not enough data to determine if there were any relationships between income questions and the service-connected disability rating that the Veteran shared in their post. Additional research is needed to understand if specific PGs or disability ratings are more strongly associated with confusion over changes to income.

     _“I just got a new job last year and I’m making more. It’s over the income limit. It doesn’t say I’d get kicked out \[of VA medical benefits] tho. The providers I’m currently seeing are great and I’d rather not have to look for a new one.”_
     
     _–_
     
     _“I am waiting on approval for a \[...] claim that should put me at 10% \[service-connected disability rating]. Will I be eligible for VA care at that point or will my income level continue to prevent me from utiliz\[ing] VA healthcare services?”_

- **How might we…**

  - Increase awareness and understanding of income’s role in VA health care eligibility? (Education)

  - Improve processes for updating financial information so that it is easier and more accessible? (Process improvement)

  - Clarify the connection between income, service-connected disability ratings, and VA health care eligibility? (Clarifying complex interactions)

  - Provide proactive notifications to Veterans about eligibility changes when their income or employment status changes? (Proactive communication)

**Finding 2: Veterans want to verify their eligibility for covered care prior to enrollment and updating their information to avoid surprises.  (Goal 1: Q2 and Goal 2: Q1)**

- While VA.gov provides an overview of health benefits and [copay rates](https://www.va.gov/health-care/copay-rates/), these pages require Veterans to understand (1) what their PG# is, and (2) what service-connected conditions they have that are covered. This analysis and prior research has shown that that PG# is not a part of Veterans’ mental model for health care eligibility ([source](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/research/2023-06-Priority%20Group%20and%20Financial%20Disclosure)). 

- 35% of posts (55 of 159) wanted to understand how covered care at VA works in relation to their health insurance plan.

  - 8% of posts (12 of 159) were confused about the difference between VA health care and health insurance. A number of these posts questioned whether having health insurance was necessary, regardless of the Veteran’s PG# or service-connected disability rating.

  - 8% of posts (12 of 159) wanted more information about maximizing their health care between VA and their private health insurance. Consistent across these posts was a fear of being stuck with an unexpected medical bill, or having VA health care revoked if it was used for the “wrong reasons.”

- High negative sentiment and misinformation: Health care eligibility accounted for the highest negative sentiment in posts analyzed for this study (7 of 25). It also made up the largest group of posts where Veterans were misinformed (10 of 26).

     _How exactly is the VA "not an insurance company?"_
     
     _I just had my first appointment yesterday and the nurse looked stunned when I told her I had no other insurance. She explained that if I were in a car crash or something, it'd be unlikely that the VA would pay for the treatment I'd receive in the ER._
     
     _Is that even true? When I registered for VA health care on the .gov website, they list things that are covered and here's a verbatim quote on a section about urgent care, "You may need to pay a copay for outpatient care for conditions not related to your military service, at the rates listed below." This implies that not only will they pay it, there won't even be a copay for things related to service connected issues._

     _–_

     _Recently, I've been having a lot of neck and back pain so I went to a local chiropractor who has done an exam and gotten me some xrays. I don't currently have a service connection to these issues and haven't been seen at community care for these before. I'm wondering if it's possibly to get the VA to cover some of the costs as I've heard they will work with private insurances and pick up the remaining balances. I'm not sure if there any truth there or what I will need to do to get this started._
     
     _What steps should I take to help me for the future appointments for this?_
     
     _–_

     _I have TRICARE Prime but was just rated 100% P\&T._
     
     _Can I use both \[civilian and VA] hospitals for opinions? I would like to be seen by the VA for a second opinion on my knee._
     
     _TRICARE told me a meniscus tear will heal itself with exercise but it’s been almost a year and I am still unsteady._
     
     _Will there be issues if I use the VA medical along with Prime? I have a family._
     
     _Would I get reimbursed for mileage at the VA?_
     
     _–_

     _Should I rely on the VA health system or should I get private insurance as well?_
     
     _Does anyone here rely solely on the VA for their health care? I just don't want an emergency to come up and then be screwed because I didn't read the fine print._

- **How might we…**

  - Help Veterans verify their eligibility for VA covered care before they enroll or update their information? (Verification)

  - Simplify the connection between between a Veteran’s Priority Group (PG#), service-connected conditions, and covered care? (Simplification)

  - Clarify the difference between VA health care and private health insurance and reduce the fear of unexpected medical bills from using VA health care? (Clarification)

  - Address misinformation and negative sentiment around health care eligibility and VA benefits? (Addressing misinformation)

**Finding 3: The current notification system does not meet Veterans current mental models or information needs. (Goal 2: Q1 and Goal 3: Q2)**

- 8% of posts (12 of 159) referenced issues with the current health care benefits update notification system. These posts fell into the following categories:

  - Notifications are not presented to the Veteran when they’re needed (9 of 12): Veterans suffering from an emergency or life/health status change do not know they can apply for hardship or how updating their information could potentially upgrade their PG#.

  - Notifications do not feel personalized or relevant to the Veteran (5 of 12): Veterans receiving letters to update their financial information felt that reporting last year’s income should not be relevant to their current eligibility or health care needs.

  - Notifications do not convey the necessity to update information (3 of 12): Veterans do not understand why they need to provide VA with their health insurance provider information, and wonder whether they can avoid reporting this and still receive health care at VA.

  - Notifications do not fit mental models (1 of 12): A Veteran wanted to know why his VA Profile had updated his contact information but that did not automatically update his contact information for VHA. While this finding was an edge case in the present study, it has been recorded in other studies with Veterans ([source](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/authenticated-patterns/Design%20and%20Research/2024-07-Research%20Initiative-One-Prefill/Prefill%20Research%20Report%2009_2024.md)).

- Negative sentiment: out of the 25 posts recorded with negative sentiment, 5 mentioned the current health care benefits update notification system. This was the third largest group of negative sentiment posts, after health care eligibility (7 posts), and navigating health care at VA (7 posts).

     _“I was on active duty all of 2022 but for almost all of 2023, I was working at Walmart and getting paid pennies on the dollar. how is it okay/fair that they use information that no longer applies to me and could affect my benefits? sorry if this is a dumb question it just doesn't make sense for my health benefits to be decided on a year when I was making 20-30k more than I have all of 2023.”_
     
     _–_

     _“Whom do I need to contact to change medical copay statement address?_
     
     _My VA profile address is correct, but there is typo in my VA medical copay statement address. I just found the statement on my online account, not sure if it can be delivered to me with inaccurate address, only one letter of typo on street address._
     
     _I cannot believe that they don't automatically pull address from \[VA] profile.”_
     
     _–_

     _“Got a lovely letter in the mail telling me I have 30 days to verify my income eligibility for 2 years ago, because apparently the VA couldn't read a 1099 form from the IRS properly and decided that every single transaction within the brokerage form, constituted income._
     
     _So now I have the joy of trying to prove to them I did not somehow go from 29k a year in income to 80k.”_

- **How Might We**…

  - Deliver notifications to Veterans when they’re most relevant to life changes or health changes? (Timeliness)

  - Improve Veterans’ understanding of why they need to update their information and how it affects their health care? (Clarity & necessity)

  - Align different VA systems so that updating one profile (VA Profile) automatically updates other related profiles (VHA)? (System misalignment)

  - Design the notification system to better meet Veterans’ expectations and reduce the frustration associated with updating their health information? (Negative sentiment)

**Finding 4: When Veterans are in a transitional period, such as a job change, a health change, or retirement, they are proactive in seeking guidance and support for their health care. (Goal 3: Q1).** 

- Questions about accessing VA health care were clustered around 3 key stages in the Veteran journey. While thematic findings have been covered above, we noted there were narrative and action-based clusters within the following stages:

  - 15% (25 of 159) of posts fell into the **Starting Up** stage. Posts in this cluster emphasized a desire to proactively establish care for themselves and their dependents, and maximize their benefits at VA before they are needed.

  - 43% of posts fell into the **Taking Care of Myself** stage. Posts in this cluster were concerned with maximizing coverage for the least cost and effort to the Veteran. These individuals may not be completely financially stable, as they change jobs, upskill, or experience unforeseen circumstances. Veteran posts in this cluster wanted to proactively understand what non-service-connected factors could impact their coverage as they tried to maintain consistent care. Some Veteran posts in this category also came from Veterans who had been out of the service for some time, but were finally ready to engage VA for benefits. They wanted to fully understand how they qualified before opting into VA health care.

  - 11% (18 of 159) of posts fell into the **Putting Down Roots** stage. These individuals were getting married or divorced, adopting children, or seeking to understand their options before going through a major life milestone. Posts in this group focused on dependent benefits respective to a Veteran’s service-connected disability rating, and the ChampVA application process.

- Additional research needed to understand if any action-based narrative themes found in the research correlate to these specific stages in the Veteran journey. 

* **How Might We…**

  - Support Veterans in proactively setting up health care for themselves and their families before it’s needed? (Proactive health care setup)

  - Ensure Veterans have continuous access to resources during a stable period of their health care journey? (Health care maintenance)

  - Help Veterans manage benefits for their dependents during job transition, health changes, or retirement? (Dependent Care)

  - Provide tailored support and guidance to Veterans based on their current stage in the health care journey? (Stage-based care)


## **Additional Insights**

**Additional Insight 1: Veterans struggle to understand whether their dependents (spouse, children) are eligible for VA health care benefits. Many assume that certain service-connected disability ratings automatically extend coverage to their family.**

- 12% of posts (19 of 159) had questions about enrolling in dependent care and beneficiary benefits.

- 17 of 19 posts were ChampVA related, specifically seeking guidance on the application process and clarification about Veteran and dependent eligibility factors.

     _I just got out of active duty medically retired. I’m really lost and a bit overwhelmed with the amount of things I’m told I need to apply for and such. How do I know if my wife is covered healthcare wise? Do I need to start paying for Tricare? I’ve heard a lot about CHAMPVA should we apply for that? Im 100% P\&T sorry for all the questions and a bit of a breakdown. It’s a lot and I’m pretty confused by all of it. I just want my loved ones taken care of._
     
     _–_

     _I have been divorced for just over 4 years, and have discovered that my former spouse has been using ChampVA for the entire time. At first I assumed it was for pre-existing conditions and that it was none of my business, but posts here got me worried I'll be on the hook for uncovered medical expenses. I have no desire to stop my kids' mom from getting medical care, but I also don't want to be left holding the bag here._
     
     _What do I need to know about this, and what should I do?_
     
     _–_

     _I'm 100% p\&t. Just got married the other day. Going to turn in marriage certificate to county today. What all do I need to do now that I'm married?_
     
     _-enroll wife and child in champ VA_
     
     _-Get copy of previous marriage divorce decree_
     
     _-Beneficiary paperwork (power of attorney, etc.)_
     
     _Does anyone have a thorough checklist? I feel like I'm forgetting a lot of important stuff here!_

- **How Might We…**

  - Make it easier for Veterans to navigate and complete the ChampVA application process, while also clarifying eligibility requirements for both Veterans and their dependents?

  - Make it clearer when a Veteran needs to update their information that could have downstream effects on coverage for their dependents?

**Additional Insight 2: Difficult traveling to VA facilities is a recurring issue for many Veterans, especially those living far from VA medical centers or in rural areas.**

- 5% of posts (8 of 159) were about travel reimbursements. 

- Of those posts about travel, 5 were sharing negative experiences trying to receive care due to the Veteran struggling to find reliable transportation to a treatment facility, or navigating the VA travel reimbursement system.

     _The VA referred me to pain management and I'm supposed to be having surgical procedures to kill some nerves in my back and clean up some things but I live alone, and the surgical center requires that somebody drive you there and remain at the facility during the procedure then drive you home._
     
     _I live alone, I'm retired and going to school full time. Guys I knew at my last duty station have all moved on. (I retired out the back gate of Fort Moore because I have a cheap house there and I'm going to school on Title 31)_
     
     _The VA transportation program is for people that are blind, mobility impaired (i.e. wheelchair) and I don't fit that criteria._
     
     _I asked my VA PCM and he said "Join a church"_
     
     _–_

     _As a sarcastic army vet, I’ve been through a lot and could really use a break. My humor has reached many in the military community, and I’m hoping you can help spread the word._
     
     _Struggling with health issues from my service, I can’t work and the VA’s not making it easy. \[...]Can someone make sure I’m not crazy ?_
     
     _Plus I have travel claims put in and I haven’t been paid once since I arrived here. Patient advocate doesn’t exist. Over 35 appointments with 200+ round mileage trips not a single dime through travel pay. Claims are in manual review_

- **How Might We…**

  - Make it easier for Veterans living in rural or remote areas to access health care facilities?

  - Streamline the travel reimbursement process to ensure Veterans can easily receive support for their transportation needs?


## **Next Steps**

- Comparative analysis of other health care system notification systems

- Ideation workshop with EZR team and stakeholders on the best groupings for notifications, and the optimal delivery method(s)

- Create initial design recommendations to update the 10-10EZR and notification system


## **Further Research Needed**

Further validation is necessary to see if notification findings hold true within the broader Veteran population. Likewise, we will want to continue to look at where Veterans are in their health care journey to see if any milestone/life event and action-based narrative findings hold true.
