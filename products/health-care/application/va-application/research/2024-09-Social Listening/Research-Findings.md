## Research Goals
Healthcare updates, especially regarding financial information, are a critical touchpoint in a veteran’s health journey, as they help the VA determine if the veteran is eligible for travel pay reimbursement and whether copays are required for non-service-connected care or prescription medicines.

The online Health Care Benefit Update form (10-10EZR) is available, but there is currently no notification system in place to inform Veterans about updates. This raises key questions: Who should be notified? When should we notify them? How often should notifications be sent out? Moreover, how should we categorize Veterans for these notifications? Should we group them by Priority Group, by Disability Rating, or by other factors?

To address these challenges, we took a step back to analyze user-generated content (UGC) from social media. By examining real-world experiences shared by veterans and healthcare users, we aim to gain insight into their expectations, pain points, and preferences regarding notifications. This approach allows us to:
 - Goal 1: Understand how Veterans currently perceive their healthcare journey, especially in terms of financial information.
 - Goal 2: Identify frustrations or gaps in communication that could help us shape more effective notification strategies.
 - Goal 3: Determine patterns that may help us decide how to group Veterans for tailored notifications (e.g., by disability status, healthcare needs, or personal preferences).

## Research Questions

**Goal 1: Understand how Veterans currently perceive their healthcare journey, especially in terms of financial information.**
- How much do Veterans associate income with priority groups (and by extension, the covered care they can receive at VA)?
- How do Veterans perceive the financial-related information provided by the VA (Copayment, travel reimbursement)? 

**Goal 2: Identify frustrations or gaps in communication that could help us shape more effective notification strategies.**
- When do Veterans want to know about insurance and eligibility? Are our assumptions wrong?
- What do Veterans identify as their main frustration with the current notification system (timing, clarity, frequency)? 

**Goal 3: Determine patterns that may help us decide how to group Veterans for tailored notifications (e.g., by disability status, healthcare needs, or personal**
- Do Veterans know which life events necessitate updating their information through the EZR form, and if so, which life events?
- Do Veterans understand why they need to update their information on a (semi)regular basis to maintain their eligibility?

## Methodology 

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

** We assume...Veterans do not fully understand how financial information, such as income, impacts their eligibility for benefits, including Priority Groups and covered care.**
- Definitely true
- Text

** We assume...the current method of notifications about insurance, reliability, and billing updates do not align with Veterans' preference, leading to confusion and frustration.**
- Somewhat true
- Text

** We assume...Veterans are unclear about which life events or changes require them to update their information, resulting in infrequent updates.**
- Somewhat true
- Text

## Key Findings

_The 5-10 top findings from your study should be listed here. Write your findings so that if someone reads only these bullets they can leave feeling they got useful information and the study was worthwhile. Examples might be "Most participants used the Search field to find the form, and searched for the term 'veteran health'" or "Most participants struggled with the secondary caregiver section on the form"._

1. Finding one - Veterans do not associate their Priority Group with VA healthcare.

2. Finding two

3. Finding three

4. Finding four

5. Finding five

6. Finding six

7. Finding seven


## Details of Findings 

_For each finding, list details with supporting quotes and images when possible. Please **add relevant keywords/labels to your findings** selected from the [research repository label list](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/labels?page=1&sort=name-asc). Adding keywords/labels to your findings will help others find research relevant to their work._

**Finding 1:Veterans do not associate their Priority Group with VA healthcare. **
- 83% (132 of 159) of posts mentioned disability rating.
- 36% (57 of 159) of posts mentioned a service-connected disability but did not specify a rating.
- Only 11 posts explicitly mentioned priority groups. Of those, 3 mentioned a specific PG, and only 1 Veteran confidently knew what their PG# was.
- Based on references to service-connected disability ratings alone, 39% of Veterans posting on Reddit are in Priority Group 1.
