**Executive Summary:**
This unmoderated A/B comparitive study did provide insight into the potential user experience improvement with the form task list (orange prototype) despite the quantitative questions and ratings being a marginal preference (44% vs 39%). The open ended questions in the post-task and post-study steps revealed themes that do suggest further exploration is needed on this pattern. This is especially true with representation of key use cases that result in conditional logic, a coded prototype to test with AT and mobile users and testing prefill and status tag functionality.



## Research Goals
This study aimed to evaluate two potential form patterns — a task list pattern, the "Orange" prototype,  and a traditional flow, the "Green" prototype. These were tested on the 10-10EZ health care application to determine if there is potential to improve the form flow with a non-linear navigation. This research will help us determine if there is an opportunity to further investigate and  work on the task list experimental pattern.

This research supports Veterans in the "Getting Out," "Starting Up" (Attending to health needs - Moment that Matters), and "Taking Care of Myself" stages of their journey.



**Guiding Questions:**  

This study aims to evaluate two potential form patterns—"Orange" task list and "Green" traditional flow—for the 10-10EZ health care application to determine if there is potential to improve the form flow with a non-linear navigation.



**Specific Goals:**
- Gauge Veteran Interest: Understand Veterans' initial reactions to in both patterns, we showed both designs to all participants, in different orders.
- Evaluate Navigation & Perceived Intuitiveness: Determine how Veterans perceive ease of locating and initiating form sections in both prototypes.
- Identify High-Level Points of Confusion: Spot any early usability issues in the task list structure and navigation.
- Assess Initial Preference: Identify which pattern Veterans prefer and why.
- Gather Initial Qualitative Feedback: Collect qualitative insights on both patterns' structure and clarity, with the focus on the non-linear pattern compared to the existing form.
 


## Research Questions
- What are Veterans' initial impressions of the Orange vs. Green form navigation?
- How do they attempt to navigate and locate information in each pattern?
- Which pattern feels easier or more intuitive—and why?
- What high-level points of confusion, if any, arise during interaction with the Orange and Green flows?
- After experiencing both flows, which pattern do Veterans prefer for navigating a healthcare application and what are the reasons?
- What are their overall impressions and satisfaction levels with both designs?

  

## Methodology 

**Type:** Unmoderated

**Platform:** Optimal Workshop using Figma prototypes

**Design:** Counterbalanced (each participant sees both prototypes, setup as 2 studies in Optimal Workshop switching the first placement order)

**Cohort Assignment:**
- Cohort 1: Orange (Task List) first, then Green (Traditional Flow)
- Cohort 2: Green first, then Orange

Participants were shown limited-functionality Figma prototypes and asked to perform exploratory navigation tasks, not full data entry. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected by both open-ended and closed-ended ranking questions. 



## Hypotheses and Conclusions

**Hypothesis Statement:** The non-linear task flow assists Veterans in completing the 10-10EZ.

- **"Maybe True"**:
- While the traditional flow was preferred by some participants, the task list showed promise for flexible navigation, especially for longer forms.
- Supporting evidence: Some participants appreciated the ability to skip around in the Orange prototype. Users may prefer to complete easier sections first and return to more complex ones later if additional information is needed.
  - 19 out of 43 participants reported the task-list prototype as their preference. (44.1%)
  - 17 out of 43 participants reported the traditional prototype as their preference. (39.5%)
  - 7 out of 43 had no preference (16.3%)





## Key Findings

**1. Slight preference for the task list pattern over the traditional form flow was reported by participants.**

**2. Navigation preferences were mixed between the task list and traditional form flow patterns tested.** 

**3. Clickable elements in task list were utilized but may have caused some confusion.**

**4. The organization and status of the groups of information was appreciated among participants**

**5. Participants stated there was a lot of information to provide and gathering documents beforehand would be important.**



## Details of Findings 

**Finding 1: Slight preference for the task list pattern over the traditional form flow was reported by participants.**  

- 19 out of 43 participants (44.1%) preferred the task list (Orange) prototype, while 17 out of 43 (39.5%) preferred the traditional (Green) flow; 7 (16.3%) had no preference.
- Participants rated the Orange task list prototype as "Very Easy" in the post-task question. 71.4% in cohort 1 and 63.6% in cohort 2.
- Participants liked the clear sections, information, and status labels in the task list.
  	- _“I liked that the categories were broken down into the 6 sections. It made it easier to know if you successfully completed the individual sections.”_
	- _“Navigation was fairly easy and clearly labeled.”_
 	- _"Overall, very good. (Orange prototype) The categories were displayed in large font and then sub-categories were nested underneath. It's also a good feature to have the form move to the next page after a section is complete. I usually notice that in tax software, so that is a bonus."_ 


**Finding 2: Personal preference - to navigate linear or more freely by section.**  
Participants exhibited a personal preference for either linear progression or more flexible navigation by section. This variation was evident in post-task comments, with some users favoring a focused, step-by-step approach and others valuing an overview and the ability to maneuver freely through the application.

**Quotes:**

_Prefer Task List Flow (Orange Prototype)_
- _The task list, 100%_
- _I prefer the Orange option because it showed me what I had completed and what was upcoming. However, the Green option had a cleaner look and feel to me._
- _I liked it, but it did seem more complex that the Green. Both were clear to me and easy. But I think the Orange may be more difficult for some. Both were good._
- _I could not tell what was behind me or what was coming up next without hitting the back button (Green/traditional flow found confusing question)_

  
_Prefer Traditional Flow (Green Prototype)_
- _While I can't quantify it, it just felt less intimidating. It was very straightforward and easy to follow. I would not have any hesitations about completing the process and I think the dropout rate would be low._
- _I like the one click navigation, it doesn't leave a lot of room for error once you get the section you need, just keep clicking._
- _The separate sections that haven’t been completed give me anxiety. It’s probably my OcD and seeing the incomplete_


**Finding 3: The task list pattern tested showed participants had some confusion around the clickable elements - they equally wanted click on the text name or the status tag to navigate.**  
- Participants were unsure whether to click the section name or the status tag in the task list.
- Clickmaps showed equal use of both, as well as the navigation bar.

**Finding 4: The organization and status of the groups of information was appreciated among participants**
Grouping sections and showing progress helps users feel less overwhelmed as did letting users skip around can improve satisfaction for complex forms.

- Cohort 1 AI summary that 14% commented on the intuitive section grouping of the Orange prototoype task. Verified during synthesis affinity mapping there was a them around the grouping and sections as a positive element of the task list prototype.

**Quotes**
- _I thought Orange was really good. Breaking each area down by sections, allowing you to go at your own pace, but also seeing which areas are done and which you have left is definitely the preferred route._
- _The way the information required is places in "buckets" that can be completed in order, or in an order that easier based on the information available. And then to know when it is complete._



**Finding 5: Participants stated there was a lot of information to provide and gathering documents beforehand would be important before completing the health care application.**  
- 	Participants noted the process required a lot of information and recommended gathering documents before starting.

**Quotes:**
- _Again, a tedious job that just has to be endured._
- _It is easy to utilize. Just ensure you have all the required documentation and you should be able to get through it fairly quickly._
- _If veterans are going to be required to submit that much paperwork for health care many may not even bother to use either one.For me they are relatively easy to use,but I can see that it be difficult for others_

## **Additional Insights**
- Participants mentioned saving and returning to the form later and calling out the application save and ID details in the lower green alert.
- Most participants seemed to prefer the second prototype they were shown and in both prototypes a couple participants contradicted themselves in the comments vs their response to the close-ended preference question. 
- A small theme on cohort 1 only that contradicted normal sentiment heard in studies - this group had positive things to say about the steps in the form progress bar stepper. 
- Participants did state the instructions were often clear and understandable
 	- _One of the easiest to understand that VA has had me fillout_
  	- _Instructions are precise. Would be rather easy to follow, especially being a recent Discharged Veteran and used to filling out instructions and government paperwork/_
  	- _The instructions were clear as to what would be needed to complete the form._ 	
- Participants often stated the instructions were often clear.
  

## Recommendations

*Summarize actionable recommendations based on findings.*  

1. **Recommendation:** [Refine the task list prototype and conduct a moderated research study]  
Refine the task list coded prototype and conduct a moderated study that includes additional interview questions so we can conduct a more well-rounded study including mobile devices. 

   - Post-study survey results and questions around task list functionality: The quantitative scale ratings were very close (19 vs 17 preferring the task list). Qualitative feedback was also mixed and some notes of personal preference. 
   - Figma prototype limitations: The prototype used was designed to use for testing navigation and movement around the form. Refining the funcitionality of the task list component and statuses while running a moderated study would allow for further inquiry and questioning around the Veterans' mental model of the task list.

2. **Recommendation:** [Test for a mix of use cases and Veterans with different disability ratings and eligibility criteria]
Include various use cases and conditional logic - Veterans with a disability rating over 50% and a mix of those who answer yes to conditional logic questions.
    - A future study that further evaluates how the task list pattern works for specific use cases (like short form flow for Veterans with a disability rating over 50%) or conditional logic questions around toxic exposure, household information and multiple responses (list and loop pattern).


3. **Recommendation:** [Refine task list functionality]
Refine the usability of the task list pattern and secondary navigation within technical limitations including the status component.
 
   - To determine if there is a valid user experience benefit to the task list pattern, need to evaluate the functionality of the statuses in an environment live will replicate technical feasibility around status, alerts and prefilling of information. 


4. **Recommendation:** [Future studies with AT users]
Include AT users as part of a future moderated study with a coded prototype or staging site to ensure the task list pattern  is easy to use and accessible.

   - Test the usability of the pattern in a coded prototype or staging site so that we can include pariticpants who use screen readers or magnification to learn about their experience with the experimental pattern.



## Product User and Business Outcomes

**Desired User Outcome**
  - Improved Application Completion Rate: Users are able to complete the health care application process with fewer errors and less confusion.
  - Increased User Satisfaction: Users report higher satisfaction with the process, citing clarity and ease of use.
  - Reduced Abandonment: Fewer users drop out before completing the application due to improved guidance and task clarity.

**Deisred Business Outcome**
  - Higher Application Volume: More veterans successfully submit applications due to streamlined processes.
  - Faster Processing Times: Applications are submitted with fewer errors, requiring less manual review and correction.



## Key Performance Indicators
- Application Completion Rate (percentage of users who start and successfully submit the application)
- Time to Complete Application (average duration from start to submission)
- Drop-off Rate (percentage of users who start but do not finish the application)
- User Satisfaction Score (from post-application surveys, e.g., CSAT)


## Next Steps

- Refine prototype based on technical limitations if this would be implemented
- Create specific use cases that would result in different parts of the task list would need to be completed
- Test a coded or well-refined prototype 





## Further research needed

**Accessibility testing with assistive technology users**
 - A Figma prototype was used which created restictions on being able to conduct sessions with an accessibiity focus. Will conduct testing with participants in this group in future studies where a coded prototype or staging environment can be leveraged.

**Interactivity of task list experience**
- The clickmaps showed that participants frequently clicked on the status label to try and navigate and the task list quick link in the blue navigation bar was also frequently used.

**Form user flows and disability rating impact**
- This test did not account for the Veteran segments that would result in a participant completing the entire form (including household financial information section) or the short form (disability rating over 50%).
