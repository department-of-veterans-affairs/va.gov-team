## Research Goals
This study aimed to evaluate two potential form patterns — a task list pattern, the "Orange" prototype,  and a traditional flow, the "Green" prototype. These were tested on the 10-10EZ health care application to determine if there is potential to improve the form flow with a non-linear navigation. This research will help us determine if there is an opportunity to further investigate and  work on the task list experimental pattern.

This research supports Veterans in the "Getting Out," "Starting Up" (Attending to health needs - Moment that Matters), and "Taking Care of Myself" stages of their journey.



**Guiding Questions:**  

This study aims to evaluate two potential form patterns—"Orange" task list and "Green" traditional flow—for the 10-10EZ health care application to determine if there is potential to improve the form flow with a non-linear navigation.

**Specific Goals:**
- Gauge Veteran Interest: Understand Veterans' initial reactions to in both patterns, in a counter-balanced study, where each cohort will interact with both prototypes.
- Evaluate Navigation & Perceived Intuitiveness: Determine how Veterans perceive ease of locating and initiating form sections in both prototypes.
- Identify High-Level Points of Confusion: Spot any early usability issues in the task list structure and navigation.
- Assess Initial Preference: Identify which pattern Veterans prefer and why.
- Gather Initial Qualitative Feedback: Collect qualitative insights on both patterns' structure and clarity, with the focus on the non-linear pattern compared to the existing form.
 


## Research Questions
- What are Veterans' initial impressions of the Orange vs. Green form navigation?
- How do they attempt to navigate and locate information in each pattern?
- Which pattern feels easier or more intuitive—and why?
- What high-level points of confusion, if any, arise during interaction with the Orange and Green flows?
- After experiencing both flows, which pattern do Veterans prefer for navigating a healthcare application and what are the reasons?
- What are their overall impressions and satisfaction levels with both designs?

  

## Methodology 

**Type:** Unmoderated within-subjects study

**Platform:** Optimal Workshop using Figma prototypes

**Design:** Counterbalanced (each participant sees both prototypes, setup as 2 studies in Optimal Workshop switching the first placement order)

**Cohort Assignment:**
- Cohort 1: Orange (Task List) first, then Green (Traditional Flow)
- Cohort 2: Green first, then Orange

Participants were shown limited-functionality Figma prototypes and asked to perform exploratory navigation tasks, not full data entry. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected by both open-ended and closed-ended ranking questions. 



## Hypotheses and Conclusions

**Hypothesis Statement:** The non-linear task flow assists Veterans in completing the 10-10EZ.

- **"Maybe True"**:
- While the traditional flow was preferred by some participants, the task list showed promise for flexible navigation, especially for longer forms.
- Supporting evidence: Some participants appreciated the ability to skip around in the Orange prototype. Users may prefer to complete easier sections first and return to more complex ones later if additional information is needed.
  - 19 out of 43 participants reported the task-list prototype as their preference. (44.1%)
  - 17 out of 43 participants reported the traditional prototype as their preference. (39.5%)
  - 7 out of 43 had no preference (16.3%)





## Key Findings

**1. Slight preference for the Task List pattern over the traditional form flow.**

**2.Navigation preferences were mixed between the Task List and traditional form flow patterns.** 

**3. Clickable elements in task list were utilized but may have caused some confusion**

**4. Participants stated there was a lot of information to provide and gathering documents beforehand would be important.**



## Details of Findings 

**Finding 1: Slight preference for the Task List pattern over the traditional form flow.**  

- 9 out of 43 participants (44.1%) preferred the task list (Orange) prototype, while 17 (39.5%) preferred the traditional (Green) flow; 7 (16.3%) had no preference.
- Participants liked the clear sections, information, and status labels in the task list.
	_“I liked that the categories were broken down into the 6 sections. It made it easier to know if you successfully completed the individual sections.”_
_“Navigation was fairly easy and clearly labeled.”_


**Finding 2: Personal preference - to navigate linear or more freely by section.**  
Participants exhibited a personal preference for either linear progression or more flexible navigation by section. This variation was evident in post-task comments, with some users favoring a focused, step-by-step approach and others valuing an overview and the ability to maneuver freely through the application.

**Quotes:**

Prefer Task List Flow (Orange Prototype)
- _The task list, 100%_
- _I prefer the Orange option because it showed me what I had completed and what was upcoming. However, the Green option had a cleaner look and feel to me._
- _I liked it, but it did seem more complex that the Green. Both were clear to me and easy. But I think the Orange may be more difficult for some. Both were good._  

  
Prefer Traditional Flow (Green Prototype)
- _While I can't quantify it, it just felt less intimidating. It was very straightforward and easy to follow. I would not have any hesitations about completing the process and I think the dropout rate would be low._
- _I like the one click navigation, it doesn't leave a lot of room for error once you get the section you need, just keep clicking._
- _The separate sections that haven’t been completed give me anxiety. It’s probably my OcD and seeing the incomplete_



**Finding 3: The task list pattern tested showed participants had some confusion around the clickable elements - they equally wanted click on the text name or the status tag to navigate.**  
- Participants were unsure whether to click the section name or the status tag in the task list.
- Clickmaps showed equal use of both, as well as the navigation bar.

**Finding 4: Participants stated there was a lot of information to provide and gathering documents beforehand would be important.**  
- 	Participants noted the process required a lot of information and recommended gathering documents before starting.

**Quotes:**
- _Again, a tedious job that just has to be endured._
- _It is easy to utilize. Just ensure you have all the required documentation and you should be able to get through it fairly quickly._
- _If veterans are going to be required to submit that much paperwork for health care many may not even bother to use either one.For me they are relatively easy to use,but I can see that it be difficult for others_

## **Additional Insights**
- Participants mentioned saving and returing to the form later and calling out the application save and ID details in the lower green alert.
- A small theme on cohort 1 only that contradicted normal sentiment heard in studies - this group had positive things to say about the steps in the form progress bar stepper. 
- Participants did state the instructions were often clear and understandable
 _One of the easiest to understand that VA has had me fillout_

## Further research needed

**Accessibility testing with assistive technology users**
 - A Figma prototype was used which created restictions on being able to conduct sessions with an accessibiity focus. Will conduct testing with participants in this group in future studies where a coded prototype or staging environment can be leveraged.

**Interactivity of task list experience**
- The clickmaps showed that participants frequently clicked on the status label to try and navigate and the task list quick link in the blue navigation bar was also frequently used.

**Form user flows and disability rating impact**
- This test did not account for the Veteran segments that would result in a participant completing the entire form (including household financial information section) or the short form (disability rating over 50%).
