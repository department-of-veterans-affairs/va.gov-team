### Convo Guide / Task Instructions & Post-Questions

**Welcome Text for Participants in Optimal Workshop (Common to both cohorts):**

Thank you for participating in this study. We are exploring different ways to improve the online application process for VA health care on VA.gov. 

Today, we'd like you to imagine you are a Veteran applying for health care benefits using a new design concept. There are no right or wrong answers, and we are not testing your abilities. We are testing the designs.

This study will involve interacting with two different prototype versions of the health care application and answering a few questions after each, and then some comparison questions at the end. It should take approximately 30-40 minutes to complete.

**Instructions (Common to both cohorts for both tasks):**

Imagine you are a Veteran who just left the military and want to apply for VA health care benefits.

Your goal is to look around this application and see where you would enter your information.

**You donâ€™t need to fill anything out**, just explore the site and get a sense of how to move from section to section.

### Task Instructions for (Orange Prototype):**

You will now explore the Orange prototype. Click "Continue with Orange prototype"

Please begin to move around and understand where you would enter your information but you do not need to complete any of the questions.

When you have finished exploring this prototype and get to where you would submit the application, then it is complete.

**Post-Task Questions - Orange Prototype**

1.  What was your initial impression of the **Orange** prototype's ability to let you move around to the information?
2.  How easy or difficult was it to find the sections for your information in the **Orange** prototype? (Scale: 1-Very Difficult to 7-Very Easy)
3.  What did you like most about the **Orange** prototype's navigation?
4.  What did you find most confusing or challenging about the **Orange** prototype?
5.  If you had to describe the **Orange** prototype to a friend, what would you say?

### Task Instructions for (Green Prototype):**

Now, you will explore a different approach to the application, the Green prototype. Click "Continue with Green prototype"

Please begin to move around and understand where you would enter your information but you do not need to complete any of the questions.

When you have finished exploring this prototype and get to where you would submit the application, then it is complete.

**Post-Task Questions - Green Prototype**

1.  What was your initial impression of the **Green** prototype's ability to let you move around to the information?
2.  How easy or difficult was it to find the sections for your information in the **Green** prototype? (Scale: 1-Very Difficult to 7-Very Easy)
3.  What did you like most about the **Green** prototype's navigation?
4.  What did you find most confusing or challenging about the **Green** prototype?
5.  If you had to describe the **Green** prototype to a friend, what would you say?

**Final Comparative Post-Task Questions (Common to both cohorts, asked after *both* prototypes have been experienced):**

1.  Now that you've experienced both the Orange (task list) prototype and the Green (traditional flow) prototype, which approach do you think would be easier or more intuitive to move through and use when applying for VA health care?
    * The **Orange** (task list) prototype
    * The **Green** (traditional flow) prototype
    * No preference / They are equally good/bad
2.  Please explain why you chose that option. What specific aspects did you like or dislike about each design pattern?
3.  Is there anything else you would like to share about your experience with these two prototypes?
