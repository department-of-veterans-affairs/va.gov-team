## Background üèóÔ∏è

<details>
<summary>Briefly describe the background of your product.</summary>

### What problem is your product trying to solve?

The 10-10EZ form allows Veterans to apply for VA health care. This research aims to address potential friction points and optimize the user experience by exploring an alternative form pattern. The core problem is to ensure the application process is as clear, efficient, and user-friendly as possible, reducing abandonment rates and improving Veteran satisfaction.

### Where is your product situated on VA.gov?

This product is situated within the authenticated and unauthenticated pathways of VA.gov, specifically under **Health Care > Apply for health care**.

### What is Veterans‚Äô familiarity with this tool?

The 10-10EZ form is an existing and critical tool for Veterans. This research explores a significant iteration on its user interface pattern, moving from a traditional sequential flow to a task list/choose-your-own-adventure approach. Veterans will likely have some familiarity with the concept of filling out forms online, but this specific pattern may be new to them in the context of VA.gov.

## OCTO-DE Priorities

<details>
<summary>Which OCTO priorities does this research support?</summary>

### Objective 1:
**VA‚Äôs digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.**

- **Key Result 1:** Improve satisfaction with our web and mobile products by 5 points.
- **Key Result 2:** Key Result 2: We have reduced the total time Veterans spend waiting for a response from our digital experiences by 50%, towards a goal of less than 4 seconds per transaction.

### [Veteran Journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)

This new pattern currently fits into the following stages of the Veteran journey: Getting Out, Starting Up (Attending to health needs - Moment that Matters), and Taking Care of Myself.

## Research Goals ü•Ö

This study aims to evaluate two potential form patterns‚Äî**"Orange" task list** and **"Green" traditional flow**‚Äîfor the 10-10EZ health care application to determine if there is potential to improve the form flow with a non-linear navigation.

### Specific Goals:

- **Gauge Veteran Interest:** Understand Veterans' initial reactions to in both patterns, in a counter-balanced study, where each cohort will interact with both prototypes.
- **Evaluate Navigation & Perceived Intuitiveness:** Determine how Veterans perceive ease of locating and initiating form sections in both prototypes.
- **Identify High-Level Points of Confusion:** Spot any early usability issues in the task list structure and navigation.
- **Assess Initial Preference:** Identify which pattern Veterans prefer and why.
- **Gather Initial Qualitative Feedback:** Collect qualitative insights on both patterns' structure and clarity, with the focus on the non-linear pattern compared to the existing form.

### Outcome
This research will help us determine if there is an opportunity to further investigate and create a non-linear navigation on forms. This study is primarily early discovery, so that we can gauge interest and useage, before investing heavily into the creation and development of a new form navigation component.

> _Note: This study will not cover full form completion, detailed field usability, or accessibility testing._

## Research Questions

1. What are Veterans' initial impressions of the Orange vs. Green form navigation?
2. How do they attempt to navigate and locate information in each pattern?
3. Which pattern feels easier or more intuitive‚Äîand why?
4. What high-level points of confusion, if any, arise during interaction with the Orange and Green flows?
5. After experiencing both flows, which pattern do Veterans prefer for navigating a healthcare application and what are the reasons?
6. What are their overall impressions and satisfaction levels with both designs?

> _Note: Accessibility and detailed usability around task completion will be addressed in future studies._

### Hypotheses

- We want to learn if the non-linear task flow assists Veterans in completing the 10-10EZ.

- We know that short-form users (100% disability rating) might not benefit from a task list; however, Veterans who are required to fill out the longer sections, such as household information, may benefit from the opportunity to click through various sections, fill out what they can immediately, then return to the form later, if additional information is needed. Some documents that users need may not be immediately on hand. 
 
- We think Veterans will appreciate the ability to choose how they interact with forms, and that it may assist authenticated users who want to complete easier sections first, then come back to more complex sections after gathering necessarily documents or information. 

---

**We believe a non-linear task list will benefit Veterans completing longer versions of the 10-10EZ by allowing flexible navigation and the option to pause and return. While it may not add value for short-form users, we expect most Veterans will appreciate having control over how they complete the application.**

## Methodology 

**Type:** Unmoderated within-subjects study  
**Platform:** Optimal Workshop  
**Design:** Counterbalanced (each participant sees both prototypes, in varied order)

### Cohort Assignment:
- **Cohort 1:** Orange (Task List) first, then Green (Traditional Flow)
- **Cohort 2:** Green first, then Orange

Participants will be shown limited-functionality Figma prototypes and asked to perform exploratory navigation tasks, not full data entry. Quantitative and qualitative data will be collected.

### Why this method?
- Allows direct pattern comparison.
- Reduces order bias via counterbalancing.
- Optimal Workshop is well-suited for this type of interaction and feedback capture.

### Location
This study will be remote and unmoderated, using Optimal Workshop.   

- [X] **Remote**
- [ ] **In-person**

## Recruitment üéØ   

### Recruitment approach
Our intended audience is Veterans and we will partner with Perigean for recruitment. All efforts will be made to recruit a diverse sample, with participants backgrounds ranging across age, abilities, and ethnicities. Ideally, participants will not have filled out the 10-10EZ in the last 6 months, so that we avoid too much familiarity with the health enrollment form structure.      

### List the ideal completed sessions and total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study:   
- Ideal completed sessions total: 30
- Total participants: 15 per cohort
- All participants will be Veterans   

**Recruitment Target:** 50 Veterans (25 per cohort/complete 15 per cohort)  
**Tool:** Perigean  
**Device requirement:** Desktop/laptop only

### Primary Criteria (required):
- Must be a **Veteran**
- Comfortable with **online forms and websites**
- Must use **desktop or laptop**
- No online 10-10EZ completion in the **last 6 months**

### Secondary Criteria (mix desired):
- Diverse **age groups** (e.g., 25‚Äì34, 35‚Äì54, 55+)
- Mix of **genders**
- Mix of **tech comfort levels**
- Users with/without current **VA benefits**

### Screening questions   
1. Have you completed the 10-10EZ form in order to apply for VA health care in the last 6 months?
   a. Yes (exclude)
   b. No

> _Note: Accessibility testing is out of scope for this study but planned for future rounds._

- **Pilot Session** 
- `Pilot participant name:` **[Perigean to Recruit 1 participant per cohort]**
- `Date and time of pilot session:` **[TBD - Leave 3 days between Pilots before rest of sessions start; July 1-15, 2025]** 

### Research sessions (Tentative)
- **Session will be open: 07/01-07/15**

### Length of sessions
- We estimate each participant will need 30-45 minutes to complete both of the flows.
