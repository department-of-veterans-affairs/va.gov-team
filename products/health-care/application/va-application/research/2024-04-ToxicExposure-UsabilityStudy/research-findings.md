## Research Goals
These questions provide a place on the 10-10EZ health care application for Veterans to identify whether they have experienced exposure to toxic materials during their time in the military. This can help Veterans who may not qualify for VA health care or those that have a low Priority Group (7 or 8) get into a Priority Group 6 and receive additional care.

The moments that matter within the Veteran Journey are when Veterans are selecting the health care coverage according to their needs - whether that is supplemental coverage as things change in their lives or service connected or non-service connected needs.

- Goal 1: Discover areas where the **content may not be clear or need additional explanation**
- Goal 2: Discover areas where their **service history requires too much mental lift / recall** on the Veterans behalf to answer
- Goal 3: Discover **unknown usability or accessibility issues**

## Research Questions

**Goal 1: Discover areas where the content may not be clear or need additional explanation**
- Are there any questions where the Veteran says additional info would be helpful?
- Do Veterans mention the dates missing or that they would be helpful?
- Is it preferred that questions are optional, can be skipped, or to be given an explicit "I don't know" option?
- Is something more than content needed to help Veterans answer these service questions? (A link or a map for example)

**Goal 2: Discover areas where their service history requires too much mental lift / recall on the Veteran's behalf to answer**
- Do Veterans feel they should be providing this information or is this information they feel the VA should already have?
- What types of information do Veterans expect the VA to have access to?
- Do Veterans want the option to upload digital documents or proof of their exposures?
- How difficult or easy will it be for Veterans to recall or look up specific service dates and/or find supporting documentation to upload?

**Goal 3: Discover unknown usability or accessibility issues**
- Are there any accessibility issues with the bulleted list format of some questions? We're curious specifically for the extensive list on the Gulf War locations page.
- Do on-field error messages often occur? If so, are Veterans struggling with the messaging to get errors resolved?


## Methodology 

We conducted about hour-long **moderated remote usability sessions** from April 1-5, 2024. 
- 10-10EZ Form in Production on VA.gov
- Unauthenticated or authenticated via the partipants account and ability

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

#### We assume... some might have issues recalling the places/dates they served with how the questions are worded.
- Somewhat true.
- We watched participants manually enter dates from memory and were surprised that some remembered them off the top of their head, especially if the exposure was during training.
- 3 out of those 6 participants said it would be very difficult or impossible for them to identify the exact dates.
- Most participants said they would look at their DD-214 and one participant said it's a different document for Army Reserve members.
- We uncovered a usability issue where a Veteran recalled exposure over a day or two but wasn't able to enter the same month and year for start and end dates.

#### We assume... Veterans expectations around the toxic expsoure questions is that the VA should already have their service history information.
- Somewhat true.
- 3 out of 7 Veterans expressed that they would expect VA to know some of the information that they're asking for, such as service dates and overall toxic exposure.
- One Veteran said if VA is targeting Veterans who served in specific time periods and locations, such as the Vietnam War for Agent Orange, then they should proactively reach out to those people.

#### We assume... some Veterans might want additional explanatory visuals such as maps or links to help them with quicker recall of these service location questions.
- Likely false.
- This didn't naturally come up from any of the participants. It was more common that the content was unclear or misleading for the TERA questions.
- 2 participants opened the link to learn more about other toxic exposures and neither found it helpful. 


## Key Findings

<b>1. Most Veterans have been or believe they have been exposed to toxic materials in the military, but they don't know if it qualifies as "toxic exposure."</b>

<b>2. Veterans would like more information about what time periods during their service are eligible to note any toxic exposure.</b>

<b>3. Veterans would like to see more customization in the toxic exposure questions based on what VA already knows about them or what they answered previously.</b>

<b>4. There is some confusion with how to identify exposure dates and why VA is asking for them.</b>

<b>5. We uncovered some usability issues that were missed since the TERA project timeline didn't allow for a full research study until post-launch.</b>


## Details of Findings 

**Finding 1: Most Veterans have been or believe they have been exposed to toxic materials in the military, but they don't know if it qualifies as "toxic exposure."**

- 7 out of 7 Veterans expressed confusion about whether certain types of potential toxic exposure count or are what VA would define and classify as "toxic exposure."
- 6 out of 7 said they would want more information or explanation on something within the toxic exposure questions.
- One Veteran Googled multiple things during the session in order to try to determine whether he qualified. He Googled Operation Enduring Freedom on Google and determined he was not part of that operation, and he also Googled "burn pits" to see if VA was defining it the way he was in his head and determined he had been around burn pits in Haiti.
- 2 Veterans opened the link to "Learn more about exposures on our Public Health website" but neither of them found that page to be helpful.

Key quotes:

> P3: "I don't know how you would classify that something was toxic or not. In the military you're always running into something that's toxic."

> P9: "I probably would've specified asbestos if I had more information of where it applied to, like in general facilities where you stayed or anything asbestos-related. [It would be more clear if] maybe they gave examples of where it might be."

> P5: [When he clicked on the public health website link,] “I got sent to a general page that doesn’t give me much specific about what I need to know for this form. If I was filling out the form for real I’d probably say this page doesn’t help me fill out the form; I’m closing it.”


**Finding 2: Veterans would like more information about what time periods during their service are eligible to note any toxic exposure.**

- 4 out of 7 Veterans mentioned that they were likely exposed to toxins during training but don't know/don't think that counts.
- We learned that everyone in the military goes through basic training and repeatedly heard that there may have been some toxins present during training, some of which are included in the "other toxic exposures" page and some that are not, but all of those Veterans expressed hesitancy to enter that information because they weren't sure if it qualified.
- One participant was confused about the Gulf War question because they knew of multiple Gulf Wars and the dates are not included in the question.

Key quotes:

>P9: "[I was exposed to contaminated water] during training, but that's not considered active duty time. What I've been told through this whole process is it has to be specific active orders. It can't be something such as, you're on training orders at a facility. They told me all of that is not considered part of a claim." ... "That's why it's so hard for me to even make a claim. <B>If you never got deployed out of the country, you're essentially a nobody.</b>"

>P2: "I'm putting 'tear gas' because just about everyone goes through tear gas training in basic training. When you're going through basic training, you don't ask, 'Hey what's in the tear gas to make me tear and gag and just about throw up?' You know, you don't ask that. You just do as you're told."

>P4: "I was deployed to Haiti and I may not be defining burn pits the way that they're defining them, so I don't know."

>P5: "Is Afghanistan part of the Gulf War? I guess when I hear the word Gulf War I think like 1990, 1991. Maybe that's technically called the Persian Gulf War or Operation Desert Storm or Desert Shield. Maybe there was stuff happening in Afghanistan then but it's just unexpected to me. ...Does Gulf War mean both 1990, 1991, and 2003 Gulf War? There's some ambiguity to me."


**Finding 3: Veterans would like to see more customization in the toxic exposure questions based on what VA already knows about them or what they answered previously.**

- 4 out of 7 Veterans mentioned wanting the questions to be dynamic based on their DOB, service dates, or previous answers.
- 2 Veterans mentioned that the questions seem very generic and could be more tailored to the person filling them out.

Key quotes:

> P6: "I don’t know when Agent Orange stopped being used but I feel like this question could be eliminated based on some of the previous ones."

> P5: "If I clicked Southwest Asia in Gulf War during that timeframe, Spain and Greenland would have nothing to do with the Southwest Asia [response]. These cleanup response efforts would not coincide with what I clicked."

> P4: "For example, if I tell you that I've only been in Montana my entire career, then you could pretty much stop asking questions after that because it would be very unlikely that I was exposed to any of this stuff."


**Finding 4: There is some confusion with how to identify exposure dates and why VA is asking for them.**

- 6 out of 7 Veterans expressed some sort of difficulty identifying exposure dates, and 3 out of those 6 specifically said it would be very difficult or impossible for them.
- A Veteran who was exposed to firefighting foams for a day or two during training didn't know how to enter dates that were for less than a month and got an error when he entered the same month and year for start and end dates.

Key quotes:

> P6: "If I already entered my SSN why does it need dates that I might not remember?"

> P6: "I'd be looking this up from some old scanned pages. It does say you don't need exact dates, which is nice, but so much is very exact in forms and military stuff. It feels like if it's wrong, it's gonna be a problem."


**Finding 5: We uncovered some usability issues that were missed since the TERA project timeline didn't allow for a full research study until post-launch.**

- For every participant, when the user advances the page in the form they were not automatically scrolled back up to the top of the page.
- One participant kept getting an error when entering other toxic exposures in the free text field that said "Please enter a valid toxin or hazard."
- Our one participant who uses a screen reader extension in Chrome was not able to use it for the session because the extension (called Read Aloud) was showing text from the intro page no matter where they were in the form. They ended up magnifying the page to complete the session.

## Additional Insights

<b>1. Veterans expressed wanting VA to take on the burden of finding the relevant individuals and/or having their medical history on file.</b>
- 3 out of 7 Veterans expressed that they would expect VA to know some of the information that they're asking for, such as service dates and overall toxic exposure.
- One Veteran said if VA is targeting Veterans who served in specific time periods and locations, such as the Vietnam War for Agent Orange, then they should proactively reach out to those people.

Key quotes:

> P10: "I would argue that some of your information should be enough for them to find your military record. First and last name, my social, and my date of birth. They should be able to find my medical records based on that." "It's one of those things where the burden of proof is on the Veteran."

> P4: "I would have expected them to digitize my medical records from when I was in the military. It's one of the reasons I don't file a VA claim."

  
<b>2. There is still some confusion and/or frustration with providing insurance information in the 10-10EZ.</b>
- 2 participants expressed frustration with having to provide insurance information and not knowing why it's necessary.
- One participant who had Medicare was confused that the form asks about Medicare/Medicaid and then he'd still have to enter Medicare information as insurance in the next step.

Key quotes:

> P5: "Why would you wanna know if I have insurance or not if you're saying that it's your fault that I was exposed and need care?"

> P4: "This I'm a little confused about. It says [insurance] includes Medicare but I just said I have Medicare in the previous section so it seems like a duplication." "I already provided this information on the previous page so maybe I would say no [to 'Do you have health insurance coverage?' question]."

<b>3. There is still some confusion and/or frustration with providing financial information in the 10-10EZ.</b>
- There was some confusion from one participant about what to enter for other income if it didn't apply because the form doesn't let the user leave the fields blank.
- One participant was confused because he had just entered information about his spouse and then wasn't sure if the form was asking for the entire household's income or just his.
- 2 out of 7 participants said they would not want to provide their financial info.
- 4 out of 7 participants expressed confusion about one or more of the financial info questions.

Key quotes:

> P5: "Of course no one ever wants to provide their financial information. ...I know I need medical help but now you're saying some of this might be based upon my income and then you're talking about verifying stuff with the IRS - I find that a little bothersome."

> P3: "It says it's required but I don't have any of that income so I assume I have to answer a zero."

> P4: "Gross income before taxes...and this is just mine, not my wife's? Well it's misleading because it says household financial information at the top but then it says gross income from work. I think it could be more specific. I will put our entire household income in."


## Recommendations

* <b>Recommendation 1: Correct usability issues that were discovered during the study.</b>
  * For every participant, when the user advances the page in the form they were not automatically scrolled back up to the top of the page. We should resurface the past ticket that was created for the Platform team or make a new one to address this.
  * One participant kept getting an error when entering other toxic exposures in the free text field that said "Please enter a valid toxin or hazard." We've already determined that this was because commas were not allowed in the form field and our developers have implemented some explanatory text to avoid that error in [this ticket](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/10-10-health-apps-5fff0cfd1462b6000e320fc7/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/80265). The ultimate solution will be to allow commas in this form field but we have to wait until the enrollment system is updated and able to accept that character for that form field.
  * Our one participant who uses a screen reader extension in Chrome was not able to use it for the session because the extension (called Read Aloud) was showing text from the intro page no matter where they were in the form. We should bring this to the attention of our engineers so they can determine why the form isn't compatible with this screen reader extension and see if we have any agency to correct it.
  * One participant who was exposed to toxins only for a day or two wasn't able to enter the same month and year for start and end dates. We need to come up with a solution for exposures that may have taken place for less than a month so users don't have to enter false information to progress to the next page.
  

* <b>Recommendation 2: Make it more clear via content or placement that toxic exposure during training does count and should be reported in the TERA questions.</b>
  * 4 out of 7 Veterans said they may have been exposed to something toxic during training but didn't know if that counted. This was not a question we specifically asked and came up unprompted.
  * There is content in a few different places of the form that states that toxic exposure during training should be included, but it was missed by every participant.

  _This image shows one of the places where training is mentioned as a time when other toxic expoures may have occured._


* <b>Recommendation 3: Gain a more detailed understanding of what types of potential toxic exposure on the "Other toxic exposures" page would impact a Veteran's priority group from our stakeholders and make content recommendations based on these findings.</b>
  * 7 out of 7 Veterans expressed confusion about whether certain types of potential toxic exposure count or are what VA would define and classify as "toxic exposure." We should make it more clear to Veterans what types of toxic exposure are worth their time to report and what the benefit to them could be.
  * One Veteran Googled multiple things during the session in order to try to determine whether he qualified. He looked up Operation Enduring Freedom on Google and determined he was not part of that operation, and he also Googled "burn pits" to see if VA was defining it the way he was in his head and determined he had been around burn pits in Haiti.
  * If common toxins, such as asbestos for example, really could have a significant effect on a Veteran's priority group, use content to make it more clear what types of asbestos exposure may qualify and where this may have occurred. This applies to all generic toxins listed on the "Other toxic exposures" page.
  * We should consider providing dates for the Gulf War question because one of our participants wasn't sure what time period that was referring to.

 
* <b>Recommendation 4: Incorporate more branching logic into the form so Veterans are only asked questions that are potentially relevant to them.</b>
  * 4 out of 7 Veterans mentioned wanting the questions to be dynamic based on their DOB, service dates, or previous answers.
  * 2 Veterans mentioned that the questions seem very generic and could be more tailored to the person filling them out.
  * We ask for service history before the TERA questions so there's an opportunity to skip certain questions based on service dates.


* <b>Recommendation 5: Get more information about VA's efforts to reach out to certain groups for toxic exposure and determine what opportunities (if any) exist to develop personalized notifications. The goal of these would be to target Veterans who served during certain time periods in combat to encourage them to fill out toxic exposure questions, either in the 10-10EZ form or 10-10EZR if they already have VA health care.</b>
  * 3 out of 7 Veterans expressed that they would expect VA to know some of the information that they're asking for, such as service dates and overall toxic exposure.
  * One Veteran suggested that if VA is targeting Veterans who served in specific time periods and locations, such as the Vietnam War for Agent Orange, then they should proactively reach out to those people.


## Next Steps
- Share findings with developers and create tickets to correct usability issues.
- Meet with our Health Enrollment Center stakeholders to get context on some feedback from Veterans to determine what changes we may be able to make:
  - Can we further clarify what types of potential toxic exposure on the "Other toxic exposures" page would impact a Veteran's priority group and are truly worth a Veteran's time to report?
  - What efforts do you know of to target specific groups of Veterans who may be eligible, such as Veterans who were deployed during the Vietnam War?
  - Since we heard a lot of feedback about training, what kind of toxic exposures that may have occurred during training are worth a Veteran's time to report?
  - What are your requirements for the digital form in terms of branching logic? Since we ask for service dates before the TERA questions, we could only asked applicable questions based on those dates. Could there be any edge cases or negative consequences to branching logic based on service dates?
- Make content suggestions based on what we learn from the HEC stakeholders.
- Work with the CAIA team to make content updates to the TERA questions.
- Find out if any teams are or have been working to digitally notify particular groups of Veterans about toxic exposure eligibility, or if communications have been across the entire site up to this point.
  - If we determine there's an outstanding need for this and it's viable work, put together a strategy for personalized notifications and communicate with VA Notify or other relevant teams/partners t get notifications sent out to certain groups of Veterans, either on VA.gov or via email.
