## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, letâ€™s start with a few warm-up questions.

1. Do you have health care through the VA?
- [If yes: They shouldn't have been recruited, but continue with the study]
> No

2. Do you have a disability rating with the VA? [If yes] Are you comfortable sharing what percentage your disability rating is?
> No

3. Just to verify how you'll go through the form today, is it correct that you do/do not have an identity-verified VA.gov login?
- [Tracker should show this; just check with the participant for accuracy so you know if they'll be logging in or not]
> That is true


[Link to share in Zoom chat:] https://www.va.gov/health-care/apply/application/introduction
[If user is going to use their login:]
Okay now I'd like you to pull up VA.gov on your chosen browser and sign in. Once you're signed in, please share your screen with me. Let me know if you need any help doing that.

[Once they're logged in and sharing their screen:] Great, I can see your screen. Now I'm going to put a link in the Zoom chat and would like you to open it. Let me know if you need any help finding the chat.
*Wait until they have the 10-10EZ intro page pulled up*


Once you've opened the link and see a page that says "Apply for VA health care", please share your screen with me. Let me know if you need any help doing that.

[Takes a minute to log in]
[shares screen in Zoom]


## First Task: Toxic exposure intro page review - 5 minutes

- Okay we're going to start the application so you can click "Start your application without signing in" [or "Start application" if they are signed in]
- The part of the form we're looking for feedback on today is about halfway through the form so we'll need you to fill in the next several pages wih either your real info or fake info. You can do whatever you're comfortable with. If you intend to submit the application for real, you'll want to enter your real info. If not, we'll remind you not to submit when we get to the end and you don't need to worry about entering accurate info as we go through the form.
- [Direct them through all required fields until they get to toxic exposure pages.]
- [Once they're on the toxic exposure section] Okay please stop here - this is the section we'll be going through together. Thanks for your patience with that!

- I'd like you to read through this page as you normally would and let me know what thoughts you have and if anything is confusing.
- Would you select "Yes" or "No" for this question? Why?
- Okay for our purposes, let's select "Yes" so we can go through the questions.

[Shows you applied before alert]

> I may have tried to apply, I don't remember.
> That's correct (info on personal info screen)
- (enters place of birth info, re-entering city and state)
> (laughs at birth sex question)
> I think its funny they ask me what my sex was
> {address prefiolled}
> Does that look right to you? Yes
- Uses it every so often
> I sumbitted a claim not too long ago
- Has not been approved yet
  



### Things to watch for:

- [Do participants express any confusion about the verbiage used on the intro page?]
- [Do any participants open the additional info dropdown for "Learn more about enhanced eligibility status for VA health care" without being prompted to?]
- [What comments, if any, do Veterans have about the term "toxic exposure"? Do they express any confusion about what qualifies as toxic exposure?]
- [Do participants express any confusion or frustration that VA should have their service history?]

## Second Task: Toxic exposure questions - 15 minutes
- Okay now you can go through the toxic exposure questions and I'd like you to think out loud as much as possible, noting if anything is confusing. You can answer honestly if you're comfortable with it because we're curious about an eligible Veteran's experence going through this form.
- [When they get to a screen where they have to enter service dates] Do you know these dates off the top of your head? [If no:] How would you find out what they were? How long would that take you?

- Quietly enters last service question
- Does not check anything on Service history page
> If none of that applies?
> I would just continue..

--- 

- (quietly scrolls through page, can not see all of it on mobile)
- (does not open eligibility status additional info component)
> It's pretty plain
> Easy to understand
> I would say yes

- I had to go up to find it (page scrolls when clicking continue)
- (has to scroll on Gull War questions to see whole list)(answers no)
- (answers no to operations)
- (answers no to )
- (checks other toxic exposure items) (air, asbestos, occupational)
> (dates of exposure) Uh, I don't remember the dates of exposure it has been so long
> What would I put there?
> My records are so jacked up, I wouldn't know where to look
> It has take me almost a year and half after I requested my records 3 times to get the records I do have
> Throughout my career I have been exposed to jet fule
> As a young marine, exposed to asbestos. Help clean it up
> I would say it was probably... guesses on both Month and Year
> (that is you tryign to remember the absestos dates)
> I graduated bootcamp I think August/ September in 78, barracks in 79 had to do some cleaning up of the asbestos
- Trying to remember off the top of your head
> We were on that clean up crew for about 6 months so that's where that comes from


--- 

### Things to watch for:

- [Are there any usability or accessibility issues with the TERA questions and/or date pickers?]
- [Do Veterans seem to get confused or stuck on any of the terminology used?]
- [Are Veterans able to answer the questions by just reading them, or do they need to reference other information to verify their answers?]
- [Do participants express any confusion or frustration that VA should have their service history?]

## Third Task: Document upload - 5 minutes
- [When they get to DD-214 upload page] How easy or difficult would it be for you to upload your discharge papers? Do you usually have those handy?
- Are there any other documents you would either expect to be asked to upload here or want to upload in support of your responses to the toxic exposure questions we just went through?
{SKIPS THIS BECAUSE WAS AUTHENTICATED}

### Things to watch for:

- [How easy would it be for participants to upload their DD-214?]
- [Do Veterans expect to or want to upload other supporting evidence for TERA?]

## Fourth Task: Remainder of form - Rest of session until about 5 minutes remain
- Okay let's keep going through the form. It'd be really helpful if you can think out loud and explain what each section of the form means to you as you work through the questions.
- [On the household financial info page] Take a little time to read through this page as you typically would and tell me what thoughts you have or if anything is confusing.
- After reading that content, would you want to share your household financial information or not? Why?
- [On facility selection page] How would you prefer to select your chosen facility here? Why?
- [If they reach the review page] Okay you're at the final review page so please make sure you do not hit the blue submit button at the bottom if you don't want to submit this form for real. That would submit a real health care application to the VA. 


- {Scrolls up and down the household info section intro page a couple of times}
> Um, I am wondering, they are saying household financial information from 2023
> Talking about from the last year? That's what it looks like it means to me
> Oh, so just talking about that year
> I am single, so there would be no spouse included and no dependents
> I don't mind (sharing household financial information)
> Oh, I have to go back up again
> (Selects Yes)
> Um, if it is necessary for them to be able to calculate what they need to calculate, I need to share that information.
> I guess it would determine, if you made enough to take care of your finances or not.
- (scrolls through what you need income page)
  > Income is easy, I don't got no business or farm
  > That is pretty simple as far as I'm concerened
- (selects divorced)
- (Answers No to dependents)
- (pauses on income page for a brief moment)
- (enters in even number and 0's for net and other)
- (goes on to deductible page, pauses for a moment, longer than the income)
  > Trying to think of what the non-reimbrusable medical expenses may have been
  > My insurance pretty much paid for everything
  > The only thing I would think to put on there would be over the counter medication
- Opens additional info component
  > I would put an estimate of what I paid in over the counter medication
  > I don't use a whole lot of medication (colds, headache)
  > So it would be a very minimal amount
  > I will just round it up to $50 maybe
  > Just taking my best guess, I don't keep records on that kind of stuff
  > Don't like taking pills in the first place
  > I took online classes (on education question)
  > That was about $1500, my education is important to me
  > No burial expenses

- Insurance information step
  > I would be enrolled in May for Medicare part A
  > I am not right now, no
  > I would put no,
  > I do have health insurance
  > Let me see if I can find the name of the provider, I have it copied to my phone
  > Oh yeah, I know what it is...
- Enters in names - provider and policy holder
- It says provide your insurance policy number or group code
> Okay, I don't have tricare, but I took a picture on my phone
- (goes to photo library to scroll through photos looking for a photo he took of his insurance card)
- I should have tagged it so I could go to it easier
- I didn't tag it though
- Can't find it in library
- Puts in fake number for now
  > I don't know if it takes characters or not, let's see what it says
  > I don't need State and Clinic do I? It looks like it would go together...
  > I think for the Affordable Care Act they would want to know what center I am going to
  > With my zip code (prefer to find VA facility)
- Takes a minute on Facility page, sees ACA and VA facility as going together)
- Goes to VA Facility Finder to look up list based on zip code
  > Those are the ones I expected
- Tries to continue and gets error
  > So what are they asking for, state...
  > Center, 00 is the most popular one
  > My son has two purple hearts and the best place I have found is in Greenville
> Everything is correct expect insurance number and I would change the location to xyz because it is closer
> It had a finish it later tab
> This is what I expected

> Hit the continue from here
> Log back in , go to VA health care and it should have this continue your application button
> That is normally what I see when I go back in for anything
> My problem with most of the stuff on the web, it doesn't update when it says it will update
>
> When there is a resolution, I can see the resultion, I can never see it
> I can never download it
> I have experience that on VA.gov
 - Goes to claims and sees status of "Sent development letter"
> I won' tget a development leter for a while
> It took my 3 or more phone calls and 4 weeks in the mail
> It seems easy to do online, once it gets in there it is difficult to get somebody to pay attention to it and respond
> Most of the time I would make a phone call, rather speak to a human being
> Some time their attitude when I get them on the phone is not great
> Make sure I ask the right questions and don't offend anybody
> Do a follow up call
> A lot of times people are just there to do a job, not take care of Veterans. The state of the world. 


### Things to watch for:

- [Do they open the "Learn more about enhanced eligibility status for VA health care" additional info link without being prompted?]
- [What reasons do users give for why they would or wouldn't answer the household financial info questions?]
- [Do the medicaid and medicare questions cause pause or confuse the participant?]
- [How does the participant prefer to search and/or sort facilities?]
- [If participant gets to the review page, do they open the accordions?]

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

Thanks so much for going through the form with me. I have a couple last questions before we wrap up:

- What were your overall thoughts about the toxic exposure questions we went over first?
> My first thought when I heard about Jacksonvill and the exposure there because it was so close, and the gas chambers at Cherry Point
> Same things we had to go through in bootcamp
> Sometimes we cleaned up we were told to clean up with , because we were low rank could not ask questions about
> Told to use stuff.. chemicals that were used, sometimes when we worked on aircraft and remove paint the paint removers were pretty toxic
> Nobody gave us any type of recpretory equipment when they
> I did not know if that was relevant or not - the questions were specific to things they knew were problems
> I didn't take it that they were asking my opinion, not they way I took it
> (Other things in my head I was exposed to that were toxic)
> That was something, that was a keyword that triggered a responses (asbestos)
> They did not ask about the other chemicals or greases or other things on aircraft they didn't ask about that so I didn't answer
> I did not notice the area to enter in other toxic exposures
> I was focued on the ones I recognize, not on the other
> You asked questions that were more human than what was on the survey, went a little deeper
> I don't feel like I am rushed, most of the time I want to get them done and in as quickly as possible
> I am anxious to get it done, I will miss things
> A lot goes un noticed, some of us are frustrated and anxious
> I never tried to applied for benefits, it was such an argerous thing to do, got so frustrated I didn't want to do it
> Questions i didn't understand or couldn't answer to my satisfaction
> Or don't hear for months, then call they have to send it to me... it is frustration. hard to articulate right now, it is more frustration then anything else.
> Everytime I had a question about forms, they couldn't find it or they said they sent it (in the mail) and I never got it.
> And then the resent it and I got it in 3 days. In the mail. Don't know how I could have missed that.

- Is there anything you'd change about the whole form if you could?

- Do you have any questions for me? 
> No, I wanted to be on this survey so I could give some input and see what kind of actions to making that website better
> I wanted to be part of the process of making it better



## Consent to use video clips

- Lastly, I want to circle back and re-confirm that **you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?** Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
