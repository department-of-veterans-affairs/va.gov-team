## Intro - 5 minutes


*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? Sure.

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

1. Do you have health care through the VA? No.
- [If yes: They shouldn't have been recruited, but continue with the study]

2. Do you have a disability rating with the VA? [If yes] Are you comfortable sharing what percentage your disability rating is? No. 

3. Just to verify how you'll go through the form today, is it correct that you do/do not have an identity-verified VA.gov login? That is true. 
- [Tracker should show this; just check with the participant for accuracy so you know if they'll be logging in or not]

*Wait until they have the 10-10EZ intro page pulled up*

## First Task: Toxic exposure intro page review - 5 minutes

- Okay we're going to start the application so you can click "Start your application without signing in" [or "Start application" if they are signed in]
- The part of the form we're looking for feedback on today is about halfway through the form so we'll need you to fill in the next several pages wih either your real info or fake info. You can do whatever you're comfortable with. If you intend to submit the application for real, you'll want to enter your real info. If not, we'll remind you not to submit when we get to the end and you don't need to worry about entering accurate info as we go through the form.
I thought it was funny that they asked me what my sex was, It just tickeled me. 
-How often do you log in? Every so often. 
-For what? I submitted a claim not so long ago. 
-Has it been approved? No it hasn’t.
- [Direct them through all required fields until they get to toxic exposure pages.]
- [Once they're on the toxic exposure section] Okay please stop here - this is the section we'll be going through together. Thanks for your patience with that!

- I'd like you to read through this page as you normally would and let me know what thoughts you have and if anything is confusing. 
It’s a pretty plane. It’s easy to understand. 
- Would you select "Yes" or "No" for this question? Why?
- Okay for our purposes, let's select "Yes" so we can go through the questions.
My records are so jacked up, I wouldn't know where to look. It took me a year and a half to get the little bit of records that I do have and this is asking for best-estimated dates. I graduated boot camp I think in August, or September in 1979 and we had to do some cleaning up in the barracks and we had to clean up asbestos in the barracks. We were in that clean-up crew for about six months.

I’m wondering, are they talking about this past year 2023. They are asking for household information. I’m single and have no spouse information or dependents. 

I guess it would determine if you made a enough to take care of your finances or not. 

I’m trying to think of what non-reimbursable expenses would have been because my insurance took care of everything. I would put an estimate of what I though I paid that was not covered by my insurance. I don’t use a lot of medication, just things I used for a cold or medications. I would round it up and take my best guess because I don’t keep records of that, I don’t like taking pills in the first place. 

I’ll be enrolled in Medicare part A and B in May. Right now, I’ll put no since I’m no enrolled now.

I have BlueCross Blue Shield and to enter policy number or group number.  

-How would you find a VA location? I would prefer to do it with my zip code. 

It had a finish it later tag. That is what I expected. 

-How do you think you continue? Log back into my VA healthcare and look for the continue your application button. 
Because when I filled for that last one it took me 3-4 phone calls and 4 weeks to get anything in the mail. It’s difficult to get someone to get to respond. Most of the time I make a phone call because I’d rather speak to a human being and sometimes they aren’t so great. I always do a follow-up call even though it’s really frustrating. It seems like they are there to do a job instead of helping people. 



### Things to watch for:

- [Do participants express any confusion about the verbiage used on the intro page?]
- [Do any participants open the additional info dropdown for "Learn more about enhanced eligibility status for VA health care" without being prompted to?]
- [What comments, if any, do Veterans have about the term "toxic exposure"? Do they express any confusion about what qualifies as toxic exposure?]
- [Do participants express any confusion or frustration that VA should have their service history?]

## Second Task: Toxic exposure questions - 15 minutes
- Okay now you can go through the toxic exposure questions and I'd like you to think out loud as much as possible, noting if anything is confusing. You can answer honestly if you're comfortable with it because we're curious about an eligible Veteran's experience going through this form.
- [When they get to a screen where they have to enter service dates] Do you know these dates off the top of your head? [If no:] How would you find out what they were? How long would that take you?

### Things to watch for:

- [Are there any usability or accessibility issues with the TERA questions and/or date pickers?]
- [Do Veterans seem to get confused or stuck on any of the terminology used?]
- [Are Veterans able to answer the questions by just reading them, or do they need to reference other information to verify their answers?]
- [Do participants express any confusion or frustration that VA should have their service history?]

## Third Task: Document upload - 5 minutes
- [When they get to DD-214 upload page] How easy or difficult would it be for you to upload your discharge papers? Do you usually have those handy?
- Are there any other documents you would either expect to be asked to upload here or want to upload in support of your responses to the toxic exposure questions we just went through?

### Things to watch for:

- [How easy would it be for participants to upload their DD-214?]
- [Do Veterans expect to or want to upload other supporting evidence for TERA?]

## Fourth Task: Remainder of form - Rest of session until about 5 minutes remain
- Okay let's keep going through the form. It'd be really helpful if you can think out loud and explain what each section of the form means to you as you work through the questions.
- [On the household financial info page] Take a little time to read through this page as you typically would and tell me what thoughts you have or if anything is confusing.
- After reading that content, would you want to share your household financial information or not? Why?
- [On facility selection page] How would you prefer to select your chosen facility here? Why?
- [If they reach the review page] Okay you're at the final review page so please make sure you do not hit the blue submit button at the bottom if you don't want to submit this form for real. That would submit a real health care application to the VA. 

### Things to watch for:

- [Do they open the "Learn more about enhanced eligibility status for VA health care" additional info link without being prompted?]
- [What reasons do users give for why they would or wouldn't answer the household financial info questions?]
- [Do the medicaid and medicare questions cause pause or confuse the participant?]
- [How does the participant prefer to search and/or sort facilities?]
- [If participant gets to the review page, do they open the accordions?]

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

Thanks so much for going through the form with me. I have a couple last questions before we wrap up:

- What were your overall thoughts about the toxic exposure questions we went over first? My first thought was when I heard about Jacksonville, I wondered how dangerous those gas chambers were here at Cherry Point and sometimes I wonder if the things we cleaned up, and we were low ranked and didn’t ask questions and we were told to use stuff and we didn’t know what they were.  Some of the paint strippers were pretty toxic and no one gave us masks or anything. 

- Is there anything you'd change about the whole form if you could?
- Do you have any questions for me? 

## Consent to use video clips

- Lastly, I want to circle back and re-confirm that **you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?** Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences. That’s okay with me. 

-Did you notice where we put the list of toxins that you may have been exposed to? I didn’t notice. No.
I never tried to apply for benefits because I got so frustrated that I didn’t want to do it. Because there were questions that I didn’t understand or when I submit stuff I don’t here from them until 3 months. It’s just frustrating and hard to articulate right now. Just frustrating. It took so long to get my records and they questioned the forms I sent and then they said, they didn’t get the papers that I would send.
