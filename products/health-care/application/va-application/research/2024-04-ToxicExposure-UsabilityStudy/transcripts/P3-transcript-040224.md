## P3
---


## Intro - 5 minutes


*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? Yes.
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?** Yes.


## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

1. Do you have health care through the VA? No. 
- [If yes: They shouldn't have been recruited, but continue with the study]

2. Do you have a disability rating with the VA? [If yes] Are you comfortable sharing what percentage your disability rating is? No. 

3. Just to verify how you'll go through the form today, is it correct that you do/do not have an identity-verified VA.gov login? Yes. 
- [Tracker should show this; just check with the participant for accuracy so you know if they'll be logging in or not]

[Link to share in Zoom chat:] https://www.va.gov/health-care/apply/application/introduction

[If user is going to use their login:]
Okay now I'd like you to pull up VA.gov on your chosen browser and sign in. Once you're signed in, please share your screen with me. Let me know if you need any help doing that.

[Once they're logged in and sharing their screen:] Great, I can see your screen. Now I'm going to put a link in the Zoom chat and would like you to open it. Let me know if you need any help finding the chat.
*Wait until they have the 10-10EZ intro page pulled up*


[If user is not going to log in:]
Now I'm going to put a link in the Zoom chat and would like you to open it. Let me know if you need any help finding the chat.

Once you've opened the link and see a page that says "Apply for VA health care", please share your screen with me. Let me know if you need any help doing that.


## First Task: Toxic exposure intro page review - 5 minutes

- Okay we're going to start the application so you can click "Start your application without signing in" [or "Start application" if they are signed in]
- The part of the form we're looking for feedback on today is about halfway through the form so we'll need you to fill in the next several pages wih either your real info or fake info. You can do whatever you're comfortable with. If you intend to submit the application for real, you'll want to enter your real info. If not, we'll remind you not to submit when we get to the end and you don't need to worry about entering accurate info as we go through the form.
- [Direct them through all required fields until they get to toxic exposure pages.]

- [Once they're on the toxic exposure section] Okay please stop here - this is the section we'll be going through together. Thanks for your patience with that!

- I'd like you to read through this page as you normally would and let me know what thoughts you have and if anything is confusing. No, it’s straight forward. I would want to answer the questions, yes. 
- Would you select "Yes" or "No" for this question? Why?
- Okay for our purposes, let's select "Yes" so we can go through the questions.


### Things to watch for:

- [Do participants express any confusion about the verbiage used on the intro page?]
- [Do any participants open the additional info dropdown for "Learn more about enhanced eligibility status for VA health care" without being prompted to?]
- [What comments, if any, do Veterans have about the term "toxic exposure"? Do they express any confusion about what qualifies as toxic exposure?] That was boot camp, oh jeez, that would have been in May. I was only exposed one time in training for firefighting. It was only for a day or two. I think two days. My first guess would be to change the month to June but that would be inaccurate. 
- [Do participants express any confusion or frustration that VA should have their service history?] Is the AFFF another toxin considered a toxin? They recently came out with it. I wouldn’t even know where to look. There is nothing listed besides, “other toxins not listed” I would check that block. 

## Second Task: Toxic exposure questions - 15 minutes
- Okay now you can go through the toxic exposure questions and I'd like you to think out loud as much as possible, noting if anything is confusing. You can answer honestly if you're comfortable with it because we're curious about an eligible Veteran's experence going through this form.
- [When they get to a screen where they have to enter service dates] Do you know these dates off the top of your head? [If no:] How would you find out what they were? How long would that take you?
### Things to watch for:

- [Are there any usability or accessibility issues with the TERA questions and/or date pickers?]
- [Do Veterans seem to get confused or stuck on any of the terminology used?]
- [Are Veterans able to answer the questions by just reading them, or do they need to reference other information to verify their answers?]
- [Do participants express any confusion or frustration that VA should have their service history?]

## Third Task: Document upload - 5 minutes
- [When they get to DD-214 upload page] How easy or difficult would it be for you to upload your discharge papers? Do you usually have those handy?
- Are there any other documents you would either expect to be asked to upload here or want to upload in support of your responses to the toxic exposure questions we just went through?

### Things to watch for:

- [How easy would it be for participants to upload their DD-214?]
- [Do Veterans expect to or want to upload other supporting evidence for TERA?]

## Fourth Task: Remainder of form - Rest of session until about 5 minutes remain
- Okay let's keep going through the form. It'd be really helpful if you can think out loud and explain what each section of the form means to you as you work through the questions.
- [On the household financial info page] Take a little time to read through this page as you typically would and tell me what thoughts you have or if anything is confusing.
I thought I would just go through it to see if there was anything that was an issue. If I was going to apply, I would have to click yes and then go through it. 
If you were to really enter this information, would this be difficult to find? It was just a fake number. I keep track of that number so $500,000 would be an accurate number. I get this from my taxes. 
- After reading that content, would you want to share your household financial information or not? Why?
- [On facility selection page] How would you prefer to select your chosen facility here? Why?
- [If they reach the review page] Okay you're at the final review page so please make sure you do not hit the blue submit button at the bottom if you don't want to submit this form for real. That would submit a real health care application to the VA. 

### Things to watch for:

- [Do they open the "Learn more about enhanced eligibility status for VA health care" additional info link without being prompted?]
- [What reasons do users give for why they would or wouldn't answer the household financial info questions?]
- [Do the medicaid and medicare questions cause pause or confuse the participant?] Youd have to look at your Medicare care card to get the start date. It looks like the previous section Medicare part A. It makes this last block look stranded. I’m a little confused here, Insurance information. It looks like a duplication of the previous information, and I already provided this information on the previous page. It asked for my Medicare number. I don’t think they want my Medicare information here. 
-What would you do? I would try to figure out how to get by it and I would select no. I already put my Medicare information. Medicare part and A and B are similar and part C gets tricky. 
- [How does the participant prefer to search and/or sort facilities?] It’s the closest one to where I live. 
- [If participant gets to the review page, do they open the accordions?]

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

Thanks so much for going through the form with me. I have a couple last questions before we wrap up:

- What were your overall thoughts about the toxic exposure questions we went over first? I like it. It gives me a way to see everything without all the verbiage. I like this one. 
The third bullet here, I don’t think many people will understand this, oh wait never mind, I get it, just have to finish reading the sentence. Where other insurances are the primary and the VA will cover whatever they don’t. 
Other than the concern about the AFFF and other toxins, in the military youre always running into something toxin. I don’t remember seeing anything about LED exposure not sure if its much of a thing these days. Nothing else comes to mind besides those two. 
- Is there anything you'd change about the whole form if you could? No, everything else seemed good. 
- Do you have any questions for me? 

## Consent to use video clips

- Lastly, I want to circle back and re-confirm that **you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?** Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences. Yes, I don’t have a problem with that.
