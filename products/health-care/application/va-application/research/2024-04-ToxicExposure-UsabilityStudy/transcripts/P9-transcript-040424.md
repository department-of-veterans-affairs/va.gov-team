## P9
---


## Intro - 5 minutes


*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?**


## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

1. Do you have health care through the VA? No. 
- [If yes: They shouldn't have been recruited, but continue with the study]

2. Do you have a disability rating with the VA? [If yes] Are you comfortable sharing what percentage your disability rating is? Yes. 10%. 

3. Just to verify how you'll go through the form today, is it correct that you do/do not have an identity-verified VA.gov login? Yes. 
- [Tracker should show this; just check with the participant for accuracy so you know if they'll be logging in or not]

[Link to share in Zoom chat:] https://www.va.gov/health-care/apply/application/introduction

[If user is going to use their login:]
Okay now I'd like you to pull up VA.gov on your chosen browser and sign in. Once you're signed in, please share your screen with me. Let me know if you need any help doing that.

[Once they're logged in and sharing their screen:] Great, I can see your screen. Now I'm going to put a link in the Zoom chat and would like you to open it. Let me know if you need any help finding the chat.
*Wait until they have the 10-10EZ intro page pulled up*


[If user is not going to log in:]
Now I'm going to put a link in the Zoom chat and would like you to open it. Let me know if you need any help finding the chat.

Once you've opened the link and see a page that says "Apply for VA health care", please share your screen with me. Let me know if you need any help doing that.


## First Task: Toxic exposure intro page review - 5 minutes

- Okay we're going to start the application so you can click "Start your application without signing in" [or "Start application" if they are signed in]
- The part of the form we're looking for feedback on today is about halfway through the form so we'll need you to fill in the next several pages with either your real info or fake info. You can do whatever you're comfortable with. If you intend to submit the application for real, you'll want to enter your real info. If not, we'll remind you not to submit when we get to the end and you don't need to worry about entering accurate info as we go through the form.
- [Direct them through all required fields until they get to toxic exposure pages.]
- [Once they're on the toxic exposure section] Okay please stop here - this is the section we'll be going through together. Thanks for your patience with that! 
-Do you know those dates from the top of your head? The real dates, are really close, but not exact. 
-How hard or easy is to find your records? That’s a hard one. I would have to go looking to see if I had an email related to when I was in or a secondary form, I would check me card. I wonder if that even has it. No, it doesn’t tell you. I just remember for the most part, obviously, a DD214 would give me my start date and end date. I actually didn’t get anything on my last day. You just walk out. The certificate might have dates. It’s hard for me to find my DD214, I got out in 2018 and it’s a long time ago. I put my DD214 in my safe. 

- I'd like you to read through this page as you normally would and let me know what thoughts you have and if anything is confusing.
- Would you select "Yes" or "No" for this question? Why? Yes, because specifically when I went through the eligibility I saw the words, contaminated water as something I think I have been exposed to. 
- Okay for our purposes, let's select "Yes" so we can go through the questions.


### Things to watch for:

- [Do participants express any confusion about the verbiage used on the intro page?]
- [Do any participants open the additional info dropdown for "Learn more about enhanced eligibility status for VA health care" without being prompted to?]
- [What comments, if any, do Veterans have about the term "toxic exposure"? Do they express any confusion about what qualifies as toxic exposure?]
- [Do participants express any confusion or frustration that VA should have their service history?]

## Second Task: Toxic exposure questions - 15 minutes
- Okay now you can go through the toxic exposure questions and I'd like you to think out loud as much as possible, noting if anything is confusing. You can answer honestly if you're comfortable with it because we're curious about an eligible Veteran's experience going through this form.
- [When they get to a screen where they have to enter service dates] Do you know these dates off the top of your head? [If no:] How would you find out what they were? How long would that take you?
I look at asbestos but I’m not sure. 
The way I thought about it in this scenario. That is not considered an active orders, not something as when you were training for a few weeks or stuff like that. They told me that anyone of that is not qualified. It comes from the claims process and what I did. My entire time in service, didn’t count pass my first training. After that they tell me that all my orders got knocked off. Because if you don’t deploy, you are a nobody. We did deployments for war then we would come back. 

### Things to watch for:

- [Are there any usability or accessibility issues with the TERA questions and/or date pickers?]
- [Do Veterans seem to get confused or stuck on any of the terminology used?]
- [Are Veterans able to answer the questions by just reading them, or do they need to reference other information to verify their answers?]
- [Do participants express any confusion or frustration that VA should have their service history?]

## Third Task: Document upload - 5 minutes
- [When they get to DD-214 upload page] How easy or difficult would it be for you to upload your discharge papers? Do you usually have those handy?
- Are there any other documents you would either expect to be asked to upload here or want to upload in support of your responses to the toxic exposure questions we just went through?

### Things to watch for:

- [How easy would it be for participants to upload their DD-214?]
- [Do Veterans expect to or want to upload other supporting evidence for TERA?]

## Fourth Task: Remainder of form - Rest of session until about 5 minutes remain
- Okay let's keep going through the form. It'd be really helpful if you can think out loud and explain what each section of the form means to you as you work through the questions.
- [On the household financial info page] Take a little time to read through this page as you typically would and tell me what thoughts you have or if anything is confusing. 
- After reading that content, would you want to share your household financial information or not? Why? I’m going to say, Yes. Because I’m being led through it and going through the VA just for the sake of being able to provide that information. If I could skip it, I wonder what it would say after that. I think it would be a possibility that it would stop me. Because I don’t make a lot of money, I don’t think that would negatively affect me. On a personal note, I don’t think why we need to have that on there. 
Being asked about my income and then deductible, if I have 15k in annual expenses, than my annual income is less, I can see that. 
That sentence right there is why I’m doing this ( Household financial information). 
I read we don’t put my wife as a dependent because she is working. I don’t really know. I would put no, and only put my son only. 
The bullet says, “ VA compensation” not disability, I’m not going to put anything. 
That one will be an educated guess, not an exact amount (insurance information). My wife handles all of that. 
I wouldn’t enroll in the Affordable Care act and with the little description here, I don’t think I would fill that out. 

- [On facility selection page] How would you prefer to select your chosen facility here? Why?
- [If they reach the review page] Okay you're at the final review page so please make sure you do not hit the blue submit button at the bottom if you don't want to submit this form for real. That would submit a real healthcare application to the VA. 

### Things to watch for:

- [Do they open the "Learn more about enhanced eligibility status for VA health care" additional info link without being prompted?]
- [What reasons do users give for why they would or wouldn't answer the household financial info questions?]
- [Do the medicaid and medicare questions cause pause or confuse the participant?]
- [How does the participant prefer to search and/or sort facilities?] This is nice to be able to pull you to that if you don’t know it. Going to add my zip, VA health, and view the list. Here you go. If I click on that one, it goes further into. That is just an optional thing right down below. I would just click it from the drop-down if I knew that is all I needed to know. 
This feels out of place, “You can also visit Veterans living Abroad. Maybe if they explained those instead of giving it a snip it there. 
- [If participant gets to the review page, do they open the accordions?]

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

Thanks so much for going through the form with me. I have a couple last questions before we wrap up:

- What were your overall thoughts about the toxic exposure questions we went over first? It’s nice in the review part here, it definitely covered a lot here like Asbestos. If it has where it applied to that was anything Asbestos related. It tells you Asbestos, but when you look at it or think about, I think of where like the floors or barracks you stayed in or panels in facilities. If it can give examples of where Asbestos might be or come from. 
- Is there anything you'd change about the whole form if you could? For the most part I think it was fine. It went through with very little technical issues. 
- Do you have any questions for me? No. 

## Consent to use video clips

- Lastly, I want to circle back and re-confirm that **you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?** Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
