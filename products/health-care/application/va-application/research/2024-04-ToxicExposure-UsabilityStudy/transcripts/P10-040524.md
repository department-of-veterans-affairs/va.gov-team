## P10
---


## Intro - 5 minutes


*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? Yes.
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?** Yes. 


## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

1. Do you have health care through the VA? Yes, It’s my only healthcare. 
- [If yes: They shouldn't have been recruited, but continue with the study]

2. Do you have a disability rating with the VA? [If yes] Are you comfortable sharing what percentage your disability rating is? Yes. I am at 100% total permanent. 

3. Just to verify how you'll go through the form today, is it correct that you do/do not have an identity-verified VA.gov login? I do.
- [Tracker should show this; just check with the participant for accuracy so you know if they'll be logging in or not]

[Link to share in Zoom chat:] https://www.va.gov/health-care/apply/application/introduction

[Once they're logged in and sharing their screen:] Great, I can see your screen. Now I'm going to put a link in the Zoom chat and would like you to open it. Let me know if you need any help finding the chat.
*Wait until they have the 10-10EZ intro page pulled up*


[If user is not going to log in:]
Now I'm going to put a link in the Zoom chat and would like you to open it. Let me know if you need any help finding the chat.

Once you've opened the link and see a page that says "Apply for VA health care", please share your screen with me. Let me know if you need any help doing that.


## First Task: Toxic exposure intro page review - 5 minutes

- Okay we're going to start the application so you can click "Start your application without signing in" [or "Start application" if they are signed in]
- The part of the form we're looking for feedback on today is about halfway through the form so we'll need you to fill in the next several pages with either your real info or fake info. You can do whatever you're comfortable with. If you intend to submit the application for real, you'll want to enter your real info. If not, we'll remind you not to submit when we get to the end and you don't need to worry about entering accurate info as we go through the form.
-What did you think of that little blurb? I was confused for a second, because I was double-checking what I read. I felt like if I wanted you could say, are you sure or bold it to identify, being more obvious to pick the right thing. 
- [Direct them through all required fields until they get to toxic exposure pages.]
- [Once they're on the toxic exposure section] Okay please stop here - this is the section we'll be going through together. Thanks for your patience with that!

- I'd like you to read through this page as you normally would and let me know what thoughts you have and if anything is confusing. 
I didn’t have to do the Pact Act, but I was around burn pits. I don’t feel like I have had health issues with that. 
I had a few multiple deployments, is this dropdown for all? I see this thing here. Then it’s only basing it off one exposure. What is someone was looking for a rating?  I went to Iraq but then the assumption would be my exposure was only from Iraq, but that is not the entire time served. Maybe having like an option if you have multiple exposure so they can add another one and another one. 
- Would you select "Yes" or "No" for this question? Why? Yes, because of burn pits, burning unused ammo and ammunition. 
I’m not checking the water because I am not certain. Maybe I need to wash my hands more. I don’t feel confident checking the box.
Here is another confusing thing, the start and end date, what if you had more than one. The way I take it is like the VA doesn’t want to get more information. The more information they have, the more they will pay out. I don’t know. The burden of proof is on the person. 
-If you could change this page, what would be better for you? They don’t automatically know that you were exposed, but they are making assumptions by time frames. You wouldn’t expect someone with my ethnicity or age to say they were Tuscan Airmen experience. That doesn’t make sense, you do have a range. More like, hey you were in this unit, you were exposed to Agent Orange, boom, you’re in. Lets check them out and get the rest treatment. Half of them aren’t going to remember or they are dealing with PTSD, that kind of stuff. 
I think if they had a different option, maybe even in the beginning. Maybe something with a breakdown. Like a date and year of the exposure like area of location and what type of exposure and leave an option for other and type something else. Have the year, location and what of the exposure and a little symbol to add more if they had more exposures. 
That is another weird one, it’s not required, makes no sense. Because you’re telling people that you have an exposure but you have no dates. Maybe just put down the year, location of exposure and the exposure itself and put other options if need be and add a plus sign to add more information. That would take away so many pages already. You would only be able to check off eligible locations. 
- Okay for our purposes, let's select "Yes" so we can go through the questions.


### Things to watch for:

- [Do participants express any confusion about the verbiage used on the intro page?]
- [Do any participants open the additional info dropdown for "Learn more about enhanced eligibility status for VA health care" without being prompted to?]
- [What comments, if any, do Veterans have about the term "toxic exposure"? Do they express any confusion about what qualifies as toxic exposure?]
- [Do participants express any confusion or frustration that VA should have their service history?]

## Second Task: Toxic exposure questions - 15 minutes
- Okay now you can go through the toxic exposure questions and I'd like you to think out loud as much as possible, noting if anything is confusing. You can answer honestly if you're comfortable with it because we're curious about an eligible Veteran's experence going through this form.
- [When they get to a screen where they have to enter service dates] Do you know these dates off the top of your head? [If no:] How would you find out what they were? How long would that take you?

### Things to watch for:

- [Are there any usability or accessibility issues with the TERA questions and/or date pickers?]
- [Do Veterans seem to get confused or stuck on any of the terminology used?]
- [Are Veterans able to answer the questions by just reading them, or do they need to reference other information to verify their answers?]
- [Do participants express any confusion or frustration that VA should have their service history?]

## Third Task: Document upload - 5 minutes
- [When they get to DD-214 upload page] How easy or difficult would it be for you to upload your discharge papers? Do you usually have those handy?
- Are there any other documents you would either expect to be asked to upload here or want to upload in support of your responses to the toxic exposure questions we just went through?

### Things to watch for:

- [How easy would it be for participants to upload their DD-214?]
- [Do Veterans expect to or want to upload other supporting evidence for TERA?]

## Fourth Task: Remainder of form - Rest of session until about 5 minutes remain
- Okay let's keep going through the form. It'd be really helpful if you can think out loud and explain what each section of the form means to you as you work through the questions.
- [On the household financial info page] Take a little time to read through this page as you typically would and tell me what thoughts you have or if anything is confusing.
- After reading that content, would you want to share your household financial information or not? Why?
- [On facility selection page] How would you prefer to select your chosen facility here? Why? I think this is pretty good because I’m assuming that I clicked NC, I only got NC clinics. The only other way would I can see it improved is or depends on the applicant because sometimes they don’t know the clinic name, a type of option would be you can start typing it and being a search option.
- [If they reach the review page] Okay you're at the final review page so please make sure you do not hit the blue submit button at the bottom if you don't want to submit this form for real. That would submit a real health care application to the VA. 

### Things to watch for:

- [Do they open the "Learn more about enhanced eligibility status for VA health care" additional info link without being prompted?]
- [What reasons do users give for why they would or wouldn't answer the household financial info questions?]
- [Do the medicaid and medicare questions cause pause or confuse the participant?] No. Not for more. Medicaid and Medicare is confusing for me. It’s different in every State. 
- [How does the participant prefer to search and/or sort facilities?]
- [If participant gets to the review page, do they open the accordions?]

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

Thanks so much for going through the form with me. I have a couple last questions before we wrap up:

- What were your overall thoughts about the toxic exposure questions we went over first? Some things are redundant and can be streamed line a little bit. I don’t know the criteria the VA is looking for. I don’t know what the VA is looking to critique. 
- Is there anything you'd change about the whole form if you could? No, I don’t think so. 
I had a client and they were a Veteran. They had a hard time getting VA care in general. Accessing your records and then submitting them. The PACT Act, you will need to submit your medical records. Maybe incorporating this into that process while they are signing up with the VA. I would argue that enough of your information is enough to find your military record. 
- Do you have any questions for me? 

## Consent to use video clips

- Lastly, I want to circle back and re-confirm that **you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?** Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences. Yes, that’s good.
