# Conversation Guide for [Health Enrollment Team, 10-10EZ, April 2024] - Toxic Exposure Questions Usability Study

## P5
---


## Intro - 5 minutes


*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? Yes. 
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?** Yes.


## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

1. Do you have health care through the VA? No. 
- [If yes: They shouldn't have been recruited, but continue with the study]

2. Do you have a disability rating with the VA? [If yes] Are you comfortable sharing what percentage your disability rating is? No, not at this time. 

3. Just to verify how you'll go through the form today, is it correct that you do/do not have an identity-verified VA.gov login? Yes, I do. 
- [Tracker should show this; just check with the participant for accuracy so you know if they'll be logging in or not] The last time I have tried to log in, it tells me to re-identify myself every time. I have submitted everything but I tend to lean more on user error than software error but now it tells me that the page isn’t working. 

[Link to share in Zoom chat:] https://www.va.gov/health-care/apply/application/introduction

[If user is going to use their login:]
Okay now I'd like you to pull up VA.gov on your chosen browser and sign in. Once you're signed in, please share your screen with me. Let me know if you need any help doing that. 

[Once they're logged in and sharing their screen:] Great, I can see your screen. Now I'm going to put a link in the Zoom chat and would like you to open it. Let me know if you need any help finding the chat.
*Wait until they have the 10-10EZ intro page pulled up*


[If user is not going to log in:]
Now I'm going to put a link in the Zoom chat and would like you to open it. Let me know if you need any help finding the chat.

Once you've opened the link and see a page that says "Apply for VA health care", please share your screen with me. Let me know if you need any help doing that.


## First Task: Toxic exposure intro page review - 5 minutes

- Okay we're going to start the application so you can click "Start your application without signing in" [or "Start application" if they are signed in]
- The part of the form we're looking for feedback on today is about halfway through the form so we'll need you to fill in the next several pages with either your real info or fake info. You can do whatever you're comfortable with. If you intend to submit the application for real, you'll want to enter your real info. If not, we'll remind you not to submit when we get to the end and you don't need to worry about entering accurate info as we go through the form. 
- [Direct them through all required fields until they get to toxic exposure pages.]
- [Once they're on the toxic exposure section] Okay please stop here - this is the section we'll be going through together. Thanks for your patience with that!

- I'd like you to read through this page as you normally would and let me know what thoughts you have and if anything is confusing. 
- Would you select "Yes" or "No" for this question? Why? Yes, This page was not bad. It was pretty clear. 
- Okay for our purposes, let's select "Yes" so we can go through the questions.


### Things to watch for:

- [Do participants express any confusion about the verbiage used on the intro page?]
- [Do any participants open the additional info dropdown for "Learn more about enhanced eligibility status for VA health care" without being prompted to?]
- [What comments, if any, do Veterans have about the term "toxic exposure"? Do they express any confusion about what qualifies as toxic exposure?] As for as for the clean-up and response efforts. See that I clicked that I served in the Gulf Era, I was exposed. But here in the clean-up section, these clean-up response efforts don’t coincide with what I clicked.  
- [Do participants express any confusion or frustration that VA should have their service history?]

## Second Task: Toxic exposure questions - 15 minutes
- Okay now you can go through the toxic exposure questions and I'd like you to think out loud as much as possible, noting if anything is confusing. You can answer honestly if you're comfortable with it because we're curious about an eligible Veteran's experience going through this form. It’s pretty clear. 
- [When they get to a screen where they have to enter service dates] Do you know these dates off the top of your head? [If no:] How would you find out what they were? How long would that take you?
As far as when we did gas mask training, but we take off the mask and they still make you suck the gas. I’m putting tear gas because almost everyone that goes through training, gets exposed to tear gas. But of course, the smoke coming out of that stuff we don’t think of it. 
### Things to watch for:

- [Are there any usability or accessibility issues with the TERA questions and/or date pickers?]
- [Do Veterans seem to get confused or stuck on any of the terminology used?]
- [Are Veterans able to answer the questions by just reading them, or do they need to reference other information to verify their answers?]
- [Do participants express any confusion or frustration that VA should have their service history?] I would go back to my DD214 to look at my basic training dates. I think it should be stated on there when I was in basic training. 

## Third Task: Document upload - 5 minutes
- [When they get to DD-214 upload page] How easy or difficult would it be for you to upload your discharge papers? Do you usually have those handy? Honestly, depending on the age of the Veteran, them having scanned and in a file that they can access and upload, I know a Veteran that would call us to help him scan the papers. For me, I have a digital DD214, I scanned my copy. 
- Are there any other documents you would either expect to be asked to upload here or want to upload in support of your responses to the toxic exposure questions we just went through?

### Things to watch for:

- [How easy would it be for participants to upload their DD-214?]
- [Do Veterans expect to or want to upload other supporting evidence for TERA?]

## Fourth Task: Remainder of form - Rest of session until about 5 minutes remain
- Okay let's keep going through the form. It'd be really helpful if you can think out loud and explain what each section of the form means to you as you work through the questions.
- [On the household financial info page] Take a little time to read through this page as you typically would and tell me what thoughts you have or if anything is confusing. You already have folks that have government issues and I know I need medical help but then they need to verify my income to get care, can be already a little troublesome. Once again, it’s going into personal information and then take into consideration of the age of the Veteran because some are still filing taxes. Some don’t make a lot of money and don’t file and don’t even bother.
Do be honest, it almost pisses you off because you have me fill this out based on toxins I was exposed to because you did this to me and then tell me that I may or may not be eligible based on my income after you tell me to fill this application out. 
- After reading that content, would you want to share your household financial information or not? Why? No. I should not need to give you my financial information. I got something based on something you exposed me to.
- [On facility selection page] How would you prefer to select your chosen facility here? Why?
- [If they reach the review page] Okay you're at the final review page so please make sure you do not hit the blue submit button at the bottom if you don't want to submit this form for real. That would submit a real health care application to the VA. 

### Things to watch for:

- [Do they open the "Learn more about enhanced eligibility status for VA health care" additional info link without being prompted?] Why do you need to know if I have insurance or not. I would find out why they want this information by going in to talk to someone. 
- [What reasons do users give for why they would or wouldn't answer the household financial info questions?]
- [Do the medicaid and medicare questions cause pause or confuse the participant?] 
- [How does the participant prefer to search and/or sort facilities?] I’m going down the list here for location, but if I put my zip code on the other one, it will bring the right one. It would help if these were in Alphabetical order. This means, I have to slow down and slowly go through. 
- [If participant gets to the review page, do they open the accordions?]
These are always helpful to always be able to go back and see what I put. 
Pretty cut and dry. 

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

Thanks so much for going through the form with me. I have a couple last questions before we wrap up:

- What were your overall thoughts about the toxic exposure questions we went over first? Not bad, just what I shared earlier that if it was operation Desert Storm, or even if there is exposure during basic training the chemicals and such. 
- Is there anything you'd change about the whole form if you could? No, if those are the things that they have to have to get medical assistance or help. 
Yes, the financial information. Don’t know why they would want to see that. If I clicked that I was exposed to a certain toxin, to ask me more medical questions like do I have eye issues or my lungs. More questions like that rather than my finances. 
- Do you have any questions for me? No. 

## Consent to use video clips

- Lastly, I want to circle back and re-confirm that **you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners.** Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences. Yes, that is fine.
