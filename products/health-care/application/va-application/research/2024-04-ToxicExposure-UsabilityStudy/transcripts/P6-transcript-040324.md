# Conversation Guide for [Health Enrollment Team, 10-10EZ, April 2024] - Toxic Exposure Questions Usability Study

## P6
---


## Intro - 5 minutes


*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? Yes.
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?** Yes.


## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

1. Do you have health care through the VA? No.
- [If yes: They shouldn't have been recruited, but continue with the study]

2. Do you have a disability rating with the VA? [If yes] Are you comfortable sharing what percentage your disability rating is? I don’t. 

3. Just to verify how you'll go through the form today, is it correct that you do/do not have an identity-verified VA.gov login? Yes. 

- [Tracker should show this; just check with the participant for accuracy so you know if they'll be logging in or not]

[Link to share in Zoom chat:] https://www.va.gov/health-care/apply/application/introduction

[If user is going to use their login:]
Okay now I'd like you to pull up VA.gov on your chosen browser and sign in. Once you're signed in, please share your screen with me. Let me know if you need any help doing that. 

[Once they're logged in and sharing their screen:] Great, I can see your screen. Now I'm going to put a link in the Zoom chat and would like you to open it. Let me know if you need any help finding the chat.
*Wait until they have the 10-10EZ intro page pulled up*


[If user is not going to log in:]
Now I'm going to put a link in the Zoom chat and would like you to open it. Let me know if you need any help finding the chat.

Once you've opened the link and see a page that says "Apply for VA health care", please share your screen with me. Let me know if you need any help doing that.  It looks straightforward right now. 
As for me I like keyboards rather then mobile rather than having to clicking and holding. 
Maybe this “need help” button is a little distracting for the current task. 
I notice with addresses, with the postal service, for mine it’s always on line 1 but other senders place it on line 2. Not sure what is the right way, but I see it different from different entities. 
Is there a way to not get paper notifications about this? For me, I prefer no paper be sent to me. I prefer to do things digitally. Sometimes, my mailbox is not the most secure physically. I would like to make that a choice. 
I’m seeing if it accepts dashes, looks like it accepts numbers. 
There is like an option in Windows to smooth the text to make it easy to read. This looks blocky, it doesn’t look smooth. 
I guess there are different ways for that to be worded. It’s clear but I’m not sure, it takes a little while to process (step 2 of 6 VA benefits page). Maybe 50% or less, flipping like that to ready would be easier to read. 
For me it is always daunting to find these dates. I would have to look for a form on my computer to look for the start dates. It may be called something different for certain services. Started training vs when they deployed. 
Most common is Month, day, and year. I like Year, month day. 
It would be nice if part of the day is on one line and other. Not sure if I would want a dash between the dates or if the comma or and if better. 

## First Task: Toxic exposure intro page review - 5 minutes

- Okay we're going to start the application so you can click "Start your application without signing in" [or "Start application" if they are signed in]
- The part of the form we're looking for feedback on today is about halfway through the form so we'll need you to fill in the next several pages with either your real info or fake info. You can do whatever you're comfortable with. If you intend to submit the application for real, you'll want to enter your real info. If not, we'll remind you not to submit when we get to the end and you don't need to worry about entering accurate info as we go through the form.
- [Direct them through all required fields until they get to toxic exposure pages.]
- [Once they're on the toxic exposure section] Okay please stop here - this is the section we'll be going through together. Thanks for your patience with that!

- I'd like you to read through this page as you normally would and let me know what thoughts you have and if anything is confusing. Seems like a lot of text, a lot of block. Would be nice if this was below. Another thing to get through to hinder the answer. 
- Would you select "Yes" or "No" for this question? Why? Yes, because I probably wouldn’t get any. I’m guessing the money or benefits come from yes. In me personally, I don’t think I had a lot, but I did go by some burn pits. Could have been. 
- Okay for our purposes, let's select "Yes" so we can go through the questions.


### Things to watch for:

- [Do participants express any confusion about the verbiage used on the intro page?] I didn’t know it went that far, Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 
When I hear of the word Gulf War I think of 1990-1991. Unexpected to me see Afghanistan.
Maybe names and dates to clear up the ambiguity. 
This kinda clears it up, any time in the Gulf War, it would be nice to see it on the previous page. 
- [Do any participants open the additional info dropdown for "Learn more about enhanced eligibility status for VA health care" without being prompted to?]
- [What comments, if any, do Veterans have about the term "toxic exposure"? Do they express any confusion about what qualifies as toxic exposure?]
- [Do participants express any confusion or frustration that VA should have their service history?]
## Second Task: Toxic exposure questions - 15 minutes
- Okay now you can go through the toxic exposure questions and I'd like you to think out loud as much as possible, noting if anything is confusing. You can answer honestly if you're comfortable with it because we're curious about an eligible Veteran's experience going through this form.
- [When they get to a screen where they have to enter service dates] Do you know these dates off the top of your head? [If no:] How would you find out what they were? How long would that take you? It would be more looking up from some old scan of pages. Possibly at least five minutes. Maybe more. There are a lot names for dates that mean a lot of technical things. I also wonder if doesn’t need to be exact. I wonder if it could be just the year and not the month.  
If I entered my social security number, why not use that if I can’t remember the dates. Social security number seems to be on every form or order. 
I don’t know when Agent Orange was stopped or stopped being used. I wonder if we can eliminate this question. Or almost if there were check boxes for these operations. 
Maybe have a box, like for some tax forms, they will have a box “ if you don’t know, we will see later” and move on with the form. Like we will go through it in more detail. 
This free text, I’m not sure how this will be read. Maybe more like a dropbox of options I can select. 


### Things to watch for:

- [Are there any usability or accessibility issues with the TERA questions and/or date pickers?]
- [Do Veterans seem to get confused or stuck on any of the terminology used?]
- [Are Veterans able to answer the questions by just reading them, or do they need to reference other information to verify their answers?]
- [Do participants express any confusion or frustration that VA should have their service history?]

## Third Task: Document upload - 5 minutes
- [When they get to DD-214 upload page] How easy or difficult would it be for you to upload your discharge papers? Do you usually have those handy? I’m not sure if I remember. For me it’s not a DD214, I was in the Army Reserve and we got a different form. It doesn’t just say DD214 and it says other documents. I haven’t thought of it at first but like sick call records. In the Army if you feel like or have some issue, you go there and you’re looked over by a medical person. 
No TIFF (format). Some scanners make TIFF or JPEG is the most common. 
I have access to software to compress files but what if I’m on my phone or don’t have access to a scanner and it compresses it to a high resolution photo. I guess that file size total. 
- Are there any other documents you would either expect to be asked to upload here or want to upload in support of your responses to the toxic exposure questions we just went through?

### Things to watch for:

- [How easy would it be for participants to upload their DD-214?]
- [Do Veterans expect to or want to upload other supporting evidence for TERA?]

## Fourth Task: Remainder of form - Rest of session until about 5 minutes remain
- Okay let's keep going through the form. It'd be really helpful if you can think out loud and explain what each section of the form means to you as you work through the questions.
- [On the household financial info page] Take a little time to read through this page as you typically would and tell me what thoughts you have or if anything is confusing.
- After reading that content, would you want to share your household financial information or not? Why?
- [On facility selection page] How would you prefer to select your chosen facility here? Why?
- [If they reach the review page] Okay you're at the final review page so please make sure you do not hit the blue submit button at the bottom if you don't want to submit this form for real. That would submit a real health care application to the VA. 

### Things to watch for:

- [Do they open the "Learn more about enhanced eligibility status for VA health care" additional info link without being prompted?]
- [What reasons do users give for why they would or wouldn't answer the household financial info questions?] Seems hard, I guess. What are the risks or rewards of filling that?  Almost like, it feels like what I put in feels redundant. If they are going to check the IRS, might as well get it from them. This may cause a hitch in the process. 
TIME OVER.
- [Do the medicaid and medicare questions cause pause or confuse the participant?]
- [How does the participant prefer to search and/or sort facilities?]
- [If participant gets to the review page, do they open the accordions?]

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

Thanks so much for going through the form with me. I have a couple last questions before we wrap up:

- What were your overall thoughts about the toxic exposure questions we went over first?
- Is there anything you'd change about the whole form if you could?
- Do you have any questions for me? 

## Consent to use video clips

- Lastly, I want to circle back and re-confirm that **you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?** Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
