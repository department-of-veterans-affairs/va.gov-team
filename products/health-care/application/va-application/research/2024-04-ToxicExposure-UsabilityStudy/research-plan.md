# Research Plan for [Health Enrollment Team, 10-10EZ, April 2024] - Toxic Exposure Questions Usability Study

## Background
- Questions regarding toxic exposure were added to the online 10-10EZ form following the PACT act. This research will test the implementation of those questions within the online form.
- These questions provide a place on the 10-10EZ health care application for Veterans to identify whether they have experienced exposure to toxic materials during their active duty. This can help Veterans who may not qualify for VA health care or those that have a low Priority Group (7 or 8) get into a Priority Group 6 and receive additional care.
- The 10-10EZ Health care application can be completed both unauthenticated and authenticated. Some information can be prefilled for authenticated users but these new toxic exposure questions are not prefilled.

### OCTO Priorities 

This research supports the 2024 OCTO priority of making our digital experiences the best way to access VA health care and benefits. We want to enable Veterans to get the level of health care that they are entitled to through VA via simple and clear online methods such as answering toxic exposure questions on the 10-10EZ form.

### Veteran Journey
This research fits into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) at several stages including:
- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging

- The **moments that matter** are when Veterans are selecting the health care coverage according to their needs - whether that is supplemental coverage as things change in their lives or service connected or non-service connected needs.


## Research Goals	

- **Goal 1: Discover areas where the content may not be clear or need additional explanation**

- **Goal 2: Discover areas where their service history requires too much mental lift / recall on the Veterans behalf to answer**

- **Goal 3: Discover unknown usability or accessibility issues**


### Outcome
- This research will help evaluate the content clarity and Veteran impressions around the newly added questions in the military service section for toxic exposure. This will guide us in determining what might need further clarification or edits, as well as provide data on what is working well.

### Research questions
**Goal 1: Discover areas where the content may not be clear or need additional explanation**
- Are there any questions where the Veteran says additional info would be helpful?
- Do Veterans mention the dates missing or that they would be helpful?
- Is it preferred that questions are optional, can be skipped, or to be given an explicit "I don't know" option?
- Is something more than content needed to help Veterans answer these service questions? (A link or a map for example)


**Goal 2: Discover areas where their service history requires too much mental lift / recall on the Veteran's behalf to answer**
- Do Veterans feel they should be providing this information or is this information they feel the VA should already have?
- What types of information do Veterans expect the VA to have access to?
- Do Veterans want the option to upload digital documents or proof of their exposures?
- How difficult or easy will it be for Veterans to recall or look up specific service dates and/or find supporting documentation to upload?

  
**Goal 3: Discover unknown usability or accessibility issues**
- Are there any accessibility issues with the bulleted list format of some questions? We're curious specifically for the extensive list on the Gulf War locations page.
- Do on-field error messages often occur? If so, are Veterans struggling with the messaging to get errors resolved?


### Hypothesis
- We assume... some might have issues recalling the places/dates they served with how the questions are worded. 
- We assume... Veterans expectations around the toxic expsoure questions is that the VA should already have their service history information.
- We assume... some Veterans might want additional explanatory visuals such as maps or links to help them with quicker recall of these service location questions.

## Methodology	
We will be conducting 1 hour remote usability testing where we will ask the participants to complete the live 10-10EZ form given the option of doing so authenticated with their own login or unauthenticated. 


### Location
Remote, moderated via Zoom.

## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach
Our intended audience for this research are Veterans and we will be utilizing Perigean to recruit participants.
  

### Recruitment criteria
- **Veterans: 9 Requested / 6 Completed**

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
Note: These are also in screener questions of [recruitment request ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/507).

- Are you currently receiving VA health care benefits as your primary insurance? [answer should be no to qualify for all participants]

- Do you have an identify-verified account on VA.gov? You can check on this by logging into VA.gov. If you see a prompt to verify your identity once you sign in, your identity is not yet verified. [Answering yes for 5 participants]

- Do you need to use screen reader technology to use the internet, such as VoiceOver on an iPhone, TalkBack on an Android device, or JAWS on a computer? [answer needs to be yes for 1 completed session as a secondary goal]

- Veterans who served in a combat zone (all)
  
**Veterans that served in these time periods**
- 3 Veterans who served in Vietnam-era (1961-1980 – note covering some later dates here added for PACT)
- 3 Veterans who served between 1990 and 2001 (Gulf War era)
- 3 Veterans who served after 2001 (Post 9-11 era)


**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
- Recruit at least 5 Veterans who identify as female
- Mixture of race, LGBTQ+, location, education, etc. as we're able to within primary criteria
