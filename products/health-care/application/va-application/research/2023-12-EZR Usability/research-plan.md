# Research Plan for usability study on 10-10EZR form (Updates to health benefits information), Health Enrollment Team, December 2023

## Background
The Health Benefits Update Form (10-10EZR) is a new online version of a currently paper-only form. It's used to update personal, insurance, or financial information for Veterans currently enrolled in health care benefits. Most commonly, this includes annual updates for removing a dependent or updating income information for those Veterans who are placed in a Priority Group that requires this. 

We will be usability testing the MVP version of the new online form to ensure it meets the needs of VA.gov users. The form contains 4 sections, and for MVP, must be completed and submitted in its entirety to be processed.

This study will look at the form from the perspective of two cohorts - those with disability ratings over 30% and those without - as we hypothesize these two groups will have very different experiences with this form.

The four main sections are:
- Veteran information
- Household financial information
- Insurance information
- Review




### What problem is your product trying to solve?
Veterans who want to provide updates to their personal information for increasing or maintaining their health benefits are burdened with the manual processes of calling VA, mailing in a paper form and/or visiting a facility. This is driven by the lack of an online experience and pathway to provide these updates at a more convenient time and place for the Veteran. For Veterans who must provide these updates annually, the burden is multiplied. More information available in the [product outline - 10-10EZR Health Benefits Update form](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/EZ(R)%20Update%20Capabilities/10-10EZR%20Product%20Brief%20(standalone%20form).md).

### Where is your product situated on VA.gov?
The product will live in the My Health section of VA.gov, but also be referenced by other static, informational pages on VA.gov, outside of the My Health section.

### What is Veterans’ familiarity with this tool?
The EZR is a new online form. Veterans are most likely familary with the 10-10EZ in terms of questions asked and content, however the 10-10EZR is very similar but for updating after enrollment. 

### OCTO Priorities 

The [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme) that this research supports are:

Increase 
- Completion rate of online transactions
- Usage of digital, self-service tools
- Percent of applications submitted online (vs. paper)
- Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience


### Veteran Journey
This product fits into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) during the areas:

- Getting out
- Starting up
- Taking care of myself

## Research Goals	
- Goal 1: **Pre-filled information** - Test the usability of the prefilled form fields to see if Veterans understand what information needs to be updated, that the information is prefilled and information can be changed.
- Goal 2: **Financial information update** - Test the usability of the household financial information section of the form to see if Veterans understand what they need to provide since that section is never prefilled. 
- Goal 3: **Financial information update notification** - Determine how a Veteran knows or would like to know they need to update the household financial section.

### Outcome
These learnings will allow us to evaluate for additional gaps to address in future iterations of the form. The findings and recommendations will be categorized as to if there are any blockers and what can be addressed by priority and impact.


### Research questions
#### Goal 1: **Pre-filled information** - Test the usability of the prefilled form fields to see if Veterans understand what information needs to be updated, that the information is prefilled and information can be changed.

- Do participants understand that information is prefilled?
- Are the alerts about pre-filled information at the beginning of each section effective and understandable for participants?
- Do participants understand that they can change the information that's pre-filled?
- What is the impact on participants who need to update only one section of the form vs. more than one section of the form?

#### Goal 2: **Financial information update** - Test the usability of the household/financial information section of the form to see if Veterans understand what they need to provide since that section is never pre-filled.

- Do participants understand that they need to provide updated financial information?
- Do the participants understand the impact of not providing an update?
- Do the pariticipants struggle because this section isn't prefilled as opposed to other sections?

#### Goal 3: **Disability rating and financial updates** - Determine how disability ratings affect a Veteran's understanding of the financial updates section.

- How do participants approach the financial update section when they have a low disability rating (under 10 percent)?
- How do participants approach the financial update section when they have a high disability rating (above 50 percent)?
- How do participants want to be notified that they need to update their financial information?
- Do participants know what they need to do after encoutering the intro page on the form?
- Can participants find the landing page with more information, if prompted? 

### Hypothesis
- Participants will understand that information is prefilled and be able to update and submit the information.
- Participants may be frustrated if they want to only update one section of the form vs. multiple sections because they will have to go through the form linearly.
- Participants will understand they need to update financial information.
- Participants will understand how not providing an update to financial information will impact their benefits.
- Participants with a lower disability rating will be more familar with the need to keep financial information updated to keep their benefits.
- Participants will know what they need to do based on the intro page on the form.
