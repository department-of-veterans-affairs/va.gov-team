# Conversation Guide: VSA 1010, Usability research of shortened form based on disability rating for the 10-10EZ, September 2021

## Moderator Logistics

- _Use #feedback-backchannel in Slack for real-time feedback from observers._
- _Before the session, send out the observer instructions to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into #feedback-backchannel)._
- _Make sure everyone except the participant and moderator are on mute._
- _In the Audio section, tap the drop-down arrow and make sure "Play Entry/Exit Chimes" is unchecked._
- _Check your [screensharing setup]. Make sure they are setup on Zoom app and ready to screenshare._
- _When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro._

## Project-Specific Setup and Intro - 10 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Dené and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to review a prototype of the health care application.

- This entire session should take about 45 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- You'll be interacting with a demo tool. This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- Please talk aloud as you're looking through things. For example, say "now I'd click on this, because I'd expect it to do this..." This helps me understand what's going through your head while using the tool.
- To protect your privacy, we are not going to use your real name or Social Security Number today. Feel free to make-up a name, birthday, SSN...I can always provide that information if you want
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

**Talk them through Zoom screen sharing and chat features.**


**I'm going to send you a link in the chat.**
_I actually do this as I’m explaining to them where to find “Chat” and “Share,” so by the end I’m looking at their screen, then I move onto recording._

Prototypes:
- Variation 1: [Immediate alert short form](https://preview.uxpin.com/acda277e33e9629a7ab817f6c93c251b4a60ac56#/pages/141488399/simulate/no-panels?mode=i)
- Variation 2: [Self-reported short form](https://preview.uxpin.com/19ee97072a3233029149e8865f986abfda4c1aef#/pages/141488374/simulate/no-panels)
- Variation 2.2 (updated iteration): [2.2 Self-reported short form](https://preview.uxpin.com/2a1ce93f62d447e101cfce3c803d20941fba7203#/pages/141808810/simulate/no-panels?mode=i)	


**Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:**

- Ok, it seems like we're having some trouble getting the prototype up on your screen. I'm really excited for you to participate though, so what we're going to do today is have me share my screen, and then I'm going to have you "Drive". You will tell me what to do, what to tap, on, etc. Does that sound ok?
- [Share your screen]. Can you confirm if you can see my screen?


**Recording Instructions**

- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording to the Cloud.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?"** 

Ok. Now we're really ready to begin!

## Health Care application introduction page - 5 minutes

Now that I understand a little bit more about your background. 

Let's look at the screen that I have shared with you. Put yourself back to the moment that you arrived at this screen to apply for health care benefits in the past. (or if has never applied- you arrive here with the intention of applying for health care benefits.) Go ahead and talk me through what you would do upon arriving at this page. 

If the participant immediately moves to click on "start your application..." button, I will ask them if they usually read this intro page, even if no, continue with the following questions.

- Please read the entire page and let me know if any questions come to mind.
- After participant reads and initial questions are noted:
  - What do you think of the listed requirements? 
  - Is there anything that you would not have on-hand or would need to prepare before starting this application?
  - Do you have any additional thoughts or questions? 

## Variation 1: Applying to health care benefits, 50% or higher disability rating is known at sign in (~half of participants, participant should have a disability rating of 50% or higher) - 15 minutes

Go ahead and continue as if you were applying for health care. Note if participant would sign in or not.

Let's pretend that you went through the sign in process and are taken to here (authenticated Intro page), from here please continue with the application.
- Participant will next be shown the short form notification
     - Note any response
     - Can you tell me a little about your thoughts as you read this page?
     - What do you expect to happen next?
     - Do you have any questions?
     - Is there anything that stands out to you on this page? Good, bad, indifferent

Alright, let's continue
- Participant will next navigate to the first page of the form "Veteran information"
     - Mostly let the participant fill out the form (noting any comments)
     - Make special note of how participant interacts with the green alert that talks about the short form
     - Prompt participant to interact with alert on the third or fourth page of the form if they haven't already - note any interaction/content positives/confusion


## Variation 2: Applying to health care benefits, 50% or higher disability rating is known at self-report, VA compensation question (~half of participants, participant should have a disability rating of 50% or higher) - 15 minutes

Go ahead and continue as if you were applying for health care. Note if participant would sign in or not. 

Let's pretend that you went through the sign in process and are taken to here (authenticated Intro page), from here please continue with the application.

- Participant will next navigate to the first page of the form "Veteran information"
     - Mostly let the participant fill out the form (noting any comments)

Once participant selects that they receive pay for a disability of 50% or higher:
- Participant will next be shown the short form confirmation page
     - Note any response
     - Can you tell me a little about your thoughts as you read this page?
     - What do you expect to happen next?
     - Do you have any questions?
     - Is there anything that stands out to you on this page? Good, bad, indifferent

For the purpose of this research, imagine that you actually do not have a disability rating of 50% or higher, and you reached this page by accident. What would you do next?
- Note their response/interaction

Ask participant to continue filling out the form
- Prompt participant to interact with alert on form if they haven't already - note any interaction/content positives/confusion
     
## Variation 3: Applying to health care benefits, does not have 50% or higher disability rating (1-2 participants) - 15 minutes

Go ahead and continue as if you were applying for health care. Note if participant would sign in or not. 

Let's pretend that you went through the sign in process and are taken to here (authenticated Intro page), from here please continue with the application.

- Participant will next navigate to the first page of the form "Veteran information"
     - Mostly let the participant fill out the form (noting any comments)

Once participant makes selection on VA Benefits- current compensation page and clicks "Next"
- For the purpose of this study, I'm going to ask you to go "Back"
- Let's say you accidently selected that you receive pay for a disability rating of 50% or higher and click Next (they will be shown the short form confirmation page)
     - Note any response
     - Can you tell me a little about your thoughts as you read this page?
     - What do you expect to happen next?
     - Do you have any questions?
     - Is there anything that stands out to you on this page? Good, bad, indifferent
- What would you do next (since you reached this page by accident)
     - Note reactions/ interactions/ confusions

Once the participant navigates past this to continue the form, this section of the research is complete.


## Post task questions - 5 minutes

Wonderful! I have a few questions about what you just saw in the prototype.

**Overall** 

- What did you think of the overall experience?
- Was there anything that stood out to you? Then prompt positives/ negatives / confusing
- Tell me about this experience in your own words, as if I was another Veteran interested in applying for health care
- What did you think of this "short form" experience?
- Any other thoughts or questions for me before we conclude?
