## Research Goals
The Health Benefits Update Form (10-10EZR) is a new online version of a currently paper-only form. It's used to update personal, insurance, or financial information for Veterans currently enrolled in health care benefits. Most commonly, this looks like adding or removing a dependent or updating income information. Before deciding to build this form, the team ran a generative research study, digging into one of the most common use cases for making an update to health care information (changing financial info). We learned in this study that most Veterans associate financial information with themselves and would expect to make updates to that information in either their VA profile or the MyHealth hub. While it would be preferable to only collect the information that has changed, per the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), we will collect all information together in one form submission. That means the MVP of the digital form will not differ much from the paper form, however, we plan to iterate on this approach in future versions. We'll usability test the MVP version of the new digital form to ensure it meets the needs of VA.gov users. The form contains 4 sections, and for MVP, must be completed and submitted in its entirety to be processed. The four main sections are:

- Veteran information
- Household financial information
- Insurance information
- Review

This MVP effort will go through the collaboration cycle and this study will happen post the midpoint review.


## Research Questions

*Wayfinding*
   - Are participants able to find their way to the 10-10EZR?
   - Is the wayfinding, such as the breadcrumbs and the form placement, clear to participants?

*Intro Page Content*
   - Do participants understand that they need to fill out a form to update their information?
   - Is any of the content unclear or does it confuse participants, rather than make them more comfortable with starting the form?
   - Is there any reason why participants would not fill out the form?

*Usability*
   - How do participants move through the form? Are there any blockers or points where they get stuck?
   - Does any of the form content stand out or distract participants?
   - Are participants able to complete the form without major issues?

## Methodology 

We conducted hour-long moderated semi-structured interviews, including one task-based scenario, on Zoom from November 13-20, 2023.

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

Participants will understand that some information is prefilled and will be able to update and submit the information.

   - **likely true**
   - The overwhelming majority of the participants displayed positive reactions to the pre-fill feature, noting it was helpful and time saving.
Participants may be frustrated if they want to only update one section of the form vs. multiple sections because they will have to go through the form linearly.

Participants will understand they need to update information.
   - **likely true**
   - While 8 out of 10 participants found the form easy and user-friendly, at least 2 of the participants were frustrated that the form did not direct them to the prompted task of updating health insurance information.

Participants may be frustrated if they want to only update one section of the form vs. multiple sections because they will have to go through the form linearly.
   - **likely true**
   - Most participants mentioned they have updated their information previously, with 4 participants mentioning they've used the online portal.

Participants will know what they need to do based on the intro page on the form.
   - **Not enough information**
   - While Veterans rated the intro page highly and indicated that they felt prepared to start the form, several were surprised by detailed questions about their spouse, financial information, and health insurance information.

## Key Findings

1. Finding 1 - Veterans prefer notification through email or text.

2. Finding 2 - Veterans show confusion/discomfort over providing financial information.

3. Finding 3 - Veterans generally found the 10-10EZR online form clear and user-friendly.

4. Finding 4 - Veterans found the pre-fill feature intuitive and time-saving.

## Details of Findings 

**Finding 1 - Veterans prefer notification through email or text.**

Labels: [AUD: Veterans], [BNFT: Healthcare], [PRDT: Content], [PRDT: Form 10-10 EZR], [VETJNY: Seeking support for an acute health event, maintaining my health]

Veterans want to receive a personalized email with a call-to-action and link, directing them to update or change the required information.

**Finding details:
   - 7 out of 10 Veterans talked about email when asked about their preferred mode of notifications. 
   - 4 out of 10 Veterans mentioned wanting it in text as well, or as an alternative.

   >P4: "I like working on the bigger screen. Having to keyboard those types of things."

   >P8: "When they text or email me...they put like some sort of link in there...I would say that would take me directly to it, but because of the way we have to log in I know it won't be direct."


**Finding 2 - Veterans show confusion/discomfort over providing financial information**

Labels: [AUD: Veterans], [BNFT: Healthcare], [PRDT: Content], [PRDT: Form 10-10 EZR], [VETJNY: Seeking support for an acute health event, maintaining my health]

Veterans, especially those with a high service-connected disability rating, express suspicion or confusion about having to provide detailed income and tax information.

**Finding details:
   - 5 out of 10 Veterans were surprised that the form was asking for detailed financial information. 
   - 2 Veterans were suspicious of VA asking for income information, mentioning that VA must communicate with the IRS or the IRS already has their income information on file.

> P5: "I feel like that would be on my tax return...you guys haven't asked this before - never filled this in before."

> P9: "Okay... I am just laughing. The VA form 1010EZ... hahaha. Because that is the IRS form. Doesn't it make you laugh?"

**Finding 3 - Veterans generally found the 10-10EZR online form clear and user-friendly**

Labels: [AUD: Veterans], [BNFT: Healthcare], [PRDT: Content], [PRDT: Form 10-10 EZR], [VETJNY: Seeking support for an acute health event, maintaining my health]

Veterans generally have a positive experience going through the form, noting the helpful pre-filling feature, save-for-later feature, and clear & straightforward questions.

**Finding details:
   - 8 out of 10 Veterans gave generally positive feedback going through the form.
   - 2 out of 10 Veteran expressed their dissatisfaction with not getting to the prompted task of insurance information update right away.

> P2: "I couldn't make it any better than it is."

> P4: "Oh, good. I get to add my spouse. So when I did this before I had to mail it in. So this is really nice."

> P8: "I still haven't seen the form, the portion of the form where I'm just updating my health insurance information."

**Finding 4 - Veterans found the pre-fill feature intuitive and time-saving.**

Labels: [AUD: Veterans], [BNFT: Healthcare], [PRDT: Content], [PRDT: Form 10-10 EZR], [VETJNY: Seeking support for an acute health event, maintaining my health]

Veterans generally have a positive attitude towards the pre-fill feature, noting that it would save them time typing it in and indicates that the VA already has their information.

**Finding details:
   - 9 out of 10 Veterans found the feature to be helpful and time-saving.
   - 1 out of 10 Veterans understand being asked to verify pre-filled information but do not want to fill out information beyond the prompted task of health insurance update.
   - All Veterans were observed to review their information for accuracy.

> P3: "It's pulling from my information. So that saves time versus me having to type it in."

> P9: "Pre-filling that they already know or that the information is there. I'm happy. Less to type in."


## Additional Insights

Due to the short and focused nature of the study, we do not believe this study had secondary insights worth discussing. 


## Recommendations

[Draft]
* Recommendation 1 - Provide short-form for Veterans with disability ratings of 50% and above.
    *  5 out of 10 Veterans were surprised that the form was asking for detailed financial information.
    *  7 out of 10 Veterans have a service-connected disability rating of 50% or higher.
    *  Health care enrollment does not ask for financial information of Veterans with service-connected disability rating of 50% or higher.
* Recommendation 2 - Provide minor updates to the form content to be more clear and concise. 
    * P1: "Would like to have info about why they need the spouse’s SSN"
    * P9: "Let's see it tells me how to update my VA benefits, but WHY would I want to update? Why?"
    * P10: "Veterans, especially one with stable income and retired, would want a compelling reason or mandatory requirement to fill out the form."
    * (Additional minor examples within the mural)
 * Recommendation 3 - Explore ways the Veteran can update their information without going through the whole form.
    * P7: "I'm anchoring myself mentally because my goal is to update my health insurance information so I want to make sure I'm in the right place."
    * P8: "I still haven't seen the form, the portion of the form where I'm just updating my health insurance information."
