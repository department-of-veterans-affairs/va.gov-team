## P6 

----------



## Intro - 5 minutes

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? – Yes. 
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?** -Yes. 


## Warm-up Questions - 3 minutes

Let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

1.	Do you have a service-connected disability at VA? *Yes, sleep apnea. 
- If yes: what is your disability rating? * 10%. 
- If no, skip to question 2.
2. When was the last time you visited a VA medical facility? *I have an appointment Monday. It’s been about a month. 

## First Task: [Notifications and Awareness] - 5 minutes

- Can you share any past experiences regarding updates to your health benefits information? 
*Since Covid, a lot of stuff has been more virtual like telehealth but that has affected me terribly. I had to make a lot more trips to the VA. I was on oxygen for a while. 
* I had moved once in the process and the only thing I had to do was sign into My HealtheVet. I didn’t have any problems.
  
- Imagine you've been notified to update your financial information in order to maintain your co-pay and health care benefits. How might you go about doing that?
*Annually we have to do a means test and have to go in there to verify your income and see what copays you’re eligible for. I had a lot of school loans and medical payments. I had to go into My HealtheVet to update. Very straightforward.

- Describe your preferred method of notification to update your health care information.
* Email. Whenever I need to be contacted, they email me and I can respond to them quickly. I have a mobility scooter and it broke down and I sent them a message.
  
- How would you expect to update your information online? What specific steps would you take?
*I log into My HealtheVet. Because if you call in, they transfer you here and there. 

### Things to watch for:

- [What's the participant's mental model around updating their health care information?] *calm. 
- [If they have updated their health care benefits information before, was it in person, by phone, or by mail?] *email. 


## Second Task: [Wayfinding - Static Page] - 5 minutes

- **You'll be interacting with a beta version of the website today.** This tool has not been released and it may not function exactly the way you expect. Since it is linked to the VA system, it will show you your real information. Towards the end, I will remind you not to submit anything.
- For this next scenario, imagine you just started a new job and your health insurance has changed because of it. Now, you've realized that you need to update your insurance details for your VA health care benefit. To do that, you decided to search on Google to find out how and where you can update your information. Google takes you to this page on VA.gov you're about to see. For this scenario, are you comfortable with sharing your screen and talking through your thought process? *Yes.
  
- Please be sure to close any personal information, like email, Facebook, etc., before you share your screen.
- [Share link to (https://staging.va.gov/health-care/update-health-information-1/) in Zoom chat]
  
- You arrived at this page. Please take a few minutes to review this page and explain what the content on this page means to you and then what you would do next. 
* This gives basic information on how to apply and update information. 

**Participant questions** 
- How would you want to normally navigate to this page? There’s different ways to log in, I prefer My HealtheVet. It’s straightforward. That’s where I saved my information. I see there’s 4 different options on how to update your information. I normally just do stick with the information at the top.
  
- Did you have any questions about the information listed?
* No. It’s straightforward.
  
- On a scale of 1-5 (1 being very poorly and 5 being very well) - how prepared does this page make you feel about the form you are about to begin? - Why did you give it that rating?
*5. Because it’s user friendly and straightforward. It gives you all the information needed to complete the process.
  
- Do you have any suggestions or feedback for making the page and update process better?
 *No. 

### Things to watch for:

- [Quotes from participants about any content on the static page that makes them feel uneasy, confused, or not prepared to complete the application.]
- [Comments about the terms used on the static page.]


## Third Task: [Intro page] - 5 minutes

- Could you please sign into your VA.gov account the typical way you would do so? 
- [Share link to (https://VA.gov/my-health/update-benefits-information-form-10-10ezr) in Zoom chat]
- You arrived at this page. Please take a few minutes to review this page and explain what the content on this page means to you and then what you would do next. ** Link not working** 
* This information tells you how to update your information, income, financial, spouse, insurance. I would read over them first before getting started. 

**Participant questions** 
- Please summarize the most important information you found on the page to prepare for the form.
  
- On a scale of 1-5 (1 being very poorly and 5 being very well) - how prepared does this page make you feel about the form you are about to begin? - Why did you give it that rating? * 5.

## Fourth Task: [The Form] - 10 minutes

- For this next task, we are going to have you go through the form as if you were prompted to update your information. This is a special beta version of the form, accessible via the email you provided before its official release. Please be careful not to submit unless you intend to update your health benefits information for real.
- As you go through the form, could you please talk aloud about what you would need to do as you go.
* Verify information and make sure your name is spelled correctly, DOB, social are correct and continue.
**Participant questions** 
- What are your expectations regarding the prefilling feature?

### Things to watch for:

- [Does the participant notice the pre-fill alerts?] * Yes.
- [Does the participant notice that the pre-filled information can be edited? ] *Yes.
- [Does the participant notice that the household financial information is not pre-filled? ] I think you’d have to get your taxes but I can figure it out. It would be quick for me to get the information. I would pull up a paystub.
  
* Participant questioned what they consider “Non-reimbursement medical expense”. Asked to see the drop down. Simple for me to get that information. Always ways to find it. 
- [Is there any struggle with the household and insurance's multiple-responses pattern?] * No.
  
-After submission of form? 
*You may have to go back to make sure everything was selected properly. I would go back.
## Post-Task Interview - 2 minutes

- Is there anything else you would like to add about what we talked about today?
- Any questions for me? *No.

## Consent to use video clips

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that **you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?** Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
   - If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip? No, that’s fine.
