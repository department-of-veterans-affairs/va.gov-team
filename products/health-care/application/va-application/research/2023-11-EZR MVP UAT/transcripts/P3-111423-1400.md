## P3 

----------



## Intro - 5 minutes

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? -Yes. 
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?** -Yes


## Warm-up Questions - 3 minutes

Let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

1. Do you have a service-connected disability at VA? -Yes.
- If yes: what is your disability rating? -60%
- If no, skip to question 2.
2. When was the last time you visited a VA medical facility? -Yesterday. 

## First Task: [Notifications and Awareness] - 5 minutes

- Can you share any past experiences regarding updates to your health benefits information?
* I think the updates are done by my provider. The last thing I updated was my direct deposit. I have not gone in there to do anything. I don’t think so, when I moved, I think I called and did it over the phone. It was pretty straight forward and they informed me that there were multiple clinics I could be seen at based on my address.
  
- Imagine you've been notified to update your financial information in order to maintain your co-pay and health care benefits. How might you go about doing that?
* Well, probably, I’m used to using E-benefits and signing there first, and then it takes me to the VA.gov.
  
- Describe your preferred method of notification to update your health care information.
* Either email or text.
  
- How would you expect to update your information online? What specific steps would you take?
* E-benefit and sign in there first and eventually I’ll end up at VA.gov. 

### Things to watch for:

- [What's the participant's mental model around updating their health care information?] *Calm. 
- [If they have updated their health care benefits information before, was it in person, by phone, or by mail?]


## Second Task: [Wayfinding - Static Page] - 5 minutes

- **You'll be interacting with a beta version of the website today.** This tool has not been released and it may not function exactly the way you expect. Since it is linked to the VA system, it will show you your real information. Towards the end, I will remind you not to submit anything.
- For this next scenario, imagine you just started a new job and your health insurance has changed because of it. Now, you've realized that you need to update your insurance details for your VA health care benefit. To do that, you decided to search on Google to find out how and where you can update your information. Google takes you to this page on VA.gov you're about to see. For this scenario, are you comfortable with sharing your screen and talking through your thought process?
- Please be sure to close any personal information, like email, Facebook, etc., before you share your screen.
- [Share link to (https://staging.va.gov/health-care/update-health-information-1/) in Zoom chat]
  
- You arrived at this page. Please take a few minutes to review this page and explain what the content on this page means to you and then what you would do next.
*Probably scroll and look at the left side and see if there’s an update address then I would go to sign in. Especially if there is something specific I’m looking for.  (Participant reading through the page from top to bottom). 

**Participant questions** 
- How would you want to normally navigate to this page? * Normally I would not scroll through this much information.
  
- Did you have any questions about the information listed? *No.
  
- On a scale of 1-5 (1 being very poorly and 5 being very well) - how prepared does this page make you feel about the form you are about to begin? - Why did you give it that rating? * I would say 5. It is straightforward.
  
- Do you have any suggestions or feedback for making the page and update process better? *If people would remember to scroll down the page. 
*This type of question I wouldn’t ask unless I was ready to complete it because people will think, “ why are they asking me this?” I would take this out because people might miss something. 

### Things to watch for:

- [Quotes from participants about any content on the static page that makes them feel uneasy, confused, or not prepared to complete the application.]
- [Comments about the terms used on the static page.]


## Third Task: [Intro page] - 5 minutes

- Could you please sign into your VA.gov account the typical way you would do so? 
*I don’t like all these options. You should just have one option because I can’t remember which ones I create.

- [Share link to (https://VA.gov/my-health/update-benefits-information-form-10-10ezr) in Zoom chat]
- You arrived at this page. Please take a few minutes to review this page and explain what the content on this page means to you and then what you would do next.
*(Participant looking over the page, reading though the sub-titles). 

**Participant questions** 
- Please summarize the most important information you found on the page to prepare for the form.
*It tells you what you need to know before filling out. Geeze, reading this makes me think I have to get my tax information. That will take me a while. I will probably log out and later on comeback to fill out.

*On the first beta screan ask the question about the insurance. 
*It’s a burden to fill out this form. 
- On a scale of 1-5 (1 being very poorly and 5 being very well) - how prepared does this page make you feel about the form you are about to begin? - Why did you give it that rating? 
*3, because I have to get this other information (taxes).
  
- Do you have any suggestions or feedback for making the page and update process better?
* I like that to “start” is at the bottom of the page because it might force you to read the information. 

### Things to watch for:

- [Quotes from participants about any content on the intro page that makes them feel uneasy, confused or not prepared to complete the application.]
- [Comments about time and/or actions to gather information mentioned on intro page.]
- [Does the navigational placement of the new form make sense to the Veteran?]

## Fourth Task: [The Form] - 10 minutes

- For this next task, we are going to have you go through the form as if you were prompted to update your information. This is a special beta version of the form, accessible via the email you provided before its official release. Please be careful not to submit unless you intend to update your health benefits information for real.
- As you go through the form, could you please talk aloud about what you would need to do as you go.
*I’m just verifying my social, gender. So, If I needed to update my personal information, I need to call this number?. 

**Participant questions** 
- What are your expectations regarding the prefilling feature?
* It’s good that it is pre-populated. It’s good that I don’t have to type it in. It saves time. 

### Things to watch for:

- [Does the participant notice the pre-fill alerts?] *Yes. 
- [Does the participant notice that the pre-filled information can be edited? ] *Yes. 
- [Does the participant notice that the household financial information is not pre-filled? ] *When I read household financial information, I don’t see why that has to do with marital status. 
- [Is there any struggle with the household and insurance's multiple-responses pattern?] *Who does the VA consider as a dependent? A little awkward, confused. I don’t know if the placing is off. It threw me off. 
*(Participant reading the drop-down list). 
*It seems like its asking me to add more than one dependent. (looked like the participant wanted to go back once she was confused). The screen automatically takes you to another screen if you choose “ cancel adding this dependent. 
*I’m retired, so does mean my retirement pay?  I would probably guess if I were filling it out versus finding my taxes. 

## Post-Task Interview - 2 minutes

- Is there anything else you would like to add about what we talked about today?
*it’s good that it auto-saves.

- Any questions for me? 
*No. You have to slow down and read the information and once I figured out it was straightforward. 

## Consent to use video clips

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that **you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?** Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
   - If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?
