# 10-10EZR MVP UAT Conversation Guide 

## P4 

----------



## Intro - 5 minutes

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? -Yes.
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?**- Yes.


## Warm-up Questions - 3 minutes

Let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

1. Do you have a service-connected disability at VA? – I do. 
- If yes: what is your disability rating? - 100% PNT. 
- If no, skip to question 2.
2. When was the last time you visited a VA medical facility? -In July I had an annual appointment and I had a Dental in August. 

## First Task: [Notifications and Awareness] - 5 minutes

- Can you share any past experiences regarding updates to your health benefits information?
* I submitted my first claim in 2015 and I have done all my claims myself online on E-benefits. It was a learing process getting into and once I learned, that helped me with my wording and I got my medical records and once I got those I saw things that I could submit and file my claims. I have submitted about 10 or 12 of those. Most of those times were not too difficult but for someone that was not in IT person it may have been hard to understand.
  
- Imagine you've been notified to update your financial information in order to maintain your co-pay and health care benefits. How might you go about doing that?
*I believe that is on VA.gov through ID Me. And once I go to the menu on the left side, I would submit my new routing number an account number.

- Describe your preferred method of notification to update your health care information.
- 
- How would you expect to update your information online? What specific steps would you take?
*Email. 

### Things to watch for:

- [What's the participant's mental model around updating their health care information?]
- [If they have updated their health care benefits information before, was it in person, by phone, or by mail?]


## Second Task: [Wayfinding - Static Page] - 5 minutes

- **You'll be interacting with a beta version of the website today.** This tool has not been released and it may not function exactly the way you expect. Since it is linked to the VA system, it will show you your real information. Towards the end, I will remind you not to submit anything.
- For this next scenario, imagine you just started a new job and your health insurance has changed because of it. Now, you've realized that you need to update your insurance details for your VA health care benefit. To do that, you decided to search on Google to find out how and where you can update your information. Google takes you to this page on VA.gov you're about to see. For this scenario, are you comfortable with sharing your screen and talking through your thought process? 
* No problem at all.
  
- Please be sure to close any personal information, like email, Facebook, etc., before you share your screen.
- [Share link to (https://staging.va.gov/health-care/update-health-information-1/) in Zoom chat]
- You arrived at this page. Please take a few minutes to review this page and explain what the content on this page means to you and then what you would do next. 
*It gives you a number, mail and email, which I prefer is email. It was more difficult to update things online.

-Could you update your dependent (special needs daughter)? 
* In theory I can update my dependent information on here. 

**Participant questions** 
- How would you want to normally navigate to this page? First, I would sign in.
  
- Did you have any questions about the information listed?
- On a scale of 1-5 (1 being very poorly and 5 being very well) - how prepared does this page make you feel about the form you are about to begin? - Why did you give it that rating?
*It’s well prepared if this is what I am looking for. I’m going to give it a 5. I like that it tells you the categories.

- Do you have any suggestions or feedback for making the page and update process better?
* In my mind do I need Medicare because I am at 100%? I found if I call the number at 10am on Tuesday, I don’t have to wait too long. They give you an address of what you have to send. 
*I think it’s good. I’m sure if I click “find out how” it will tell me what I need to do. 

### Things to watch for:

- [Quotes from participants about any content on the static page that makes them feel uneasy, confused, or not prepared to complete the application.]
- [Comments about the terms used on the static page.]


## Third Task: [Intro page] - 5 minutes

- Could you please sign into your VA.gov account the typical way you would do so?
*IDme.

- [Share link to (https://VA.gov/my-health/update-benefits-information-form-10-10ezr) in Zoom chat]
- You arrived at this page. Please take a few minutes to review this page and explain what the content on this page means to you and then what you would do next.
* From reading this, it makes me think I have to mail it from reading it ( Wrong link). 
* I like that the social security number is blocked out. 

**Participant questions** 
- Please summarize the most important information you found on the page to prepare for the form.
- On a scale of 1-5 (1 being very poorly and 5 being very well) - how prepared does this page make you feel about the form you are about to begin? - Why did you give it that rating?
*5.
  
- Do you have any suggestions or feedback for making the page and update process better?
* I would scroll down and check the information and make sure it is correct. If not, I would change it. For example if I moved, I would update my address. 
* I like the pre-filled information because it makes it easier for you. 

### Things to watch for:

- [Quotes from participants about any content on the intro page that makes them feel uneasy, confused or not prepared to complete the application.]
- [Comments about time and/or actions to gather information mentioned on intro page.]
- [Does the navigational placement of the new form make sense to the Veteran?]

## Fourth Task: [The Form] - 10 minutes

- For this next task, we are going to have you go through the form as if you were prompted to update your information. This is a special beta version of the form, accessible via the email you provided before its official release. Please be careful not to submit unless you intend to update your health benefits information for real.
- As you go through the form, could you please talk aloud about what you would need to do as you go.

**Participant questions** 
- What are your expectations regarding the prefilling feature?

### Things to watch for:

- [Does the participant notice the pre-fill alerts?] * Yes.
- [Does the participant notice that the pre-filled information can be edited? ] 
*Yes.  I would have the mobile number in there because most people don’t have a landline anymore. I like that it saves for you. When I did this before I had to mail everything in. I like that I can do it from here. 
* I don’t remember the income part for my daughter. I don’t want to lie on my forms. So, it asks for income (participant a little questionable about the tax information). I figured once it said Income, it would ask this type of question. I think it is pretty close to accurate ( information given) but also at the same time, I  could have sent them a text to get their gross income. 
- [Does the participant notice that the household financial information is not pre-filled? ] * Yes. 
* Only because I had already done it once before (paper form) You don’t want to make the front page too busy. 
* In the middle of this form, maybe have this auto save or finish this later on this form (annual income form).
  
- How would you come back to this form ? 
* I would search at the top in claims and progress section.
  
* I have to enter my income? (participant questioned). Particiapnt clicked on “ what is considered annual income). I’m surprised that they asked for my income at all. But that stuff is affected by my copay and status, just thinking ahead. I don’t think I have ever been asked for my income but I could be wrong however, I don’t recall.
  
*lets click on “what we consider non-reimbursable”. This would take me to do calculations and figure out amount. I’m sure I had more out of pocket expenses. I would have to get the information because they are obviously doing something with this information and I don’t want to commit fraud or mislead. This would take me a while to get this information. 
***Session went over***
*click on College/Vocational, $0 on that section. My only thought is if I have a dependent and I’m paying, that should be on this form. 
- [Is there any struggle with the household and insurance's multiple-responses pattern?] 

## Post-Task Interview - 2 minutes

- Is there anything else you would like to add about what we talked about today?
- Any questions for me? 

## Consent to use video clips

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that **you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?** Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
   - If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?
