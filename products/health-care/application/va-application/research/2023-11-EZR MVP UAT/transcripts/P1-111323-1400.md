# 10-10EZR MVP UAT Conversation Guide 

## P1 

----------



## Intro - 5 minutes

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? -Yes
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?** - Yes


## Warm-up Questions - 3 minutes

Let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

1. Do you have a service-connected disability at VA? - Yes
- If yes: what is your disability rating?- 70%
- If no, skip to question 2.
2. When was the last time you visited a VA medical facility? – 20 minutes ago. 

## First Task: [Notifications and Awareness] - 5 minutes

- Can you share any past experiences regarding updates to your health benefits information?
* Not long ago I updated something. Yearly you have to update your email, dependent, and bank account where your money goes to. It was easy. I think I saw an email; I went to the VA.gov, financial information, and a couple of other things. It was simple.
* 
- Imagine you've been notified to update your financial information in order to maintain your co-pay and health care benefits. How might you go about doing that?
*VA.gov or mypay and from there I can update anything from there. I have no copay. No copay for Veterans. Very straightforward. 
- Describe your preferred method of notification to update your health care information.
  *Email or a message straight to my phone.
  
- How would you expect to update your information online? What specific steps would you take?
*VA.gov. It’ so simple. I like to do it on my computer because it is more secure. 

### Things to watch for:

- [What's the participant's mental model around updating their health care information?]
- [If they have updated their health care benefits information before, was it in person, by phone, or by mail?]


## Second Task: [Wayfinding - Static Page] - 5 minutes

- **You'll be interacting with a beta version of the website today.** This tool has not been released and it may not function exactly the way you expect. Since it is linked to the VA system, it will show you your real information. Towards the end, I will remind you not to submit anything.
- For this next scenario, imagine you just started a new job and your health insurance has changed because of it. Now, you've realized that you need to update your insurance details for your VA health care benefit. To do that, you decided to search on Google to find out how and where you can update your information. Google takes you to this page on VA.gov you're about to see. For this scenario, are you comfortable with sharing your screen and talking through your thought process? -No problem, let's do it. 
- Please be sure to close any personal information, like email, Facebook, etc., before you share your screen.
- [Share link to (https://staging.va.gov/health-care/update-health-information-1/) in Zoom chat]
- You arrived at this page. Please take a few minutes to review this page and explain what the content on this page means to you and then what you would do next. – They want me to update my information. I already have an account. I wanted to see if they need anything else before I press anything. I can click “ learn more” if I needed more information. I can also call or email or go in person (participant went through entire page and read the subtitles). I see there’s 4 different ways to update my information. Then I would click the green button to sign in. I would expect a secure link. I always look for a secure link. On my VA health. 

**Participant questions** 
- How would you want to normally navigate to this page? -From my shortcut on my browser, prefer a Secure link. 
- Did you have any questions about the information listed? -No
- On a scale of 1-5 (1 being very poorly and 5 being very well) - how prepared does this page make you feel about the form you are about to begin? - Why did you give it that rating? -Very clear and to the point. 5. 
- Do you have any suggestions or feedback for making the page and update process better?- I think you have everything. 

### Things to watch for:

- [Quotes from participants about any content on the static page that makes them feel uneasy, confused, or not prepared to complete the application.]
- [Comments about the terms used on the static page.]


## Third Task: [Intro page] - 5 minutes

- Could you please sign into your VA.gov account the typical way you would do so? -Click My HealthVet
- [Share link to (https://VA.gov/my-health/update-benefits-information-form-10-10ezr) in Zoom chat]
- You arrived at this page. Please take a few minutes to review this page and explain what the content on this page means to you and then what you would do next. 

**Participant questions** 
- Please summarize the most important information you found on the page to prepare for the form.- Bringing back the information from before but more clearer. 
- On a scale of 1-5 (1 being very poorly and 5 being very well)- how prepared does this page make you feel about the form you are about to begin? - Why did you give it that rating? -5. Straight to the point.
- 
- Do you have any suggestions or feedback for making the page and update process better? -What does respond burden mean? Why do I have an expiration date? (questions participant had).

### Things to watch for:

- [Quotes from participants about any content on the intro page that makes them feel uneasy, confused or not prepared to complete the application.]
- [Comments about time and/or actions to gather information mentioned on intro page.]
- [Does the navigational placement of the new form make sense to the Veteran?]

## Fourth Task: [The Form] - 10 minutes

- For this next task, we are going to have you go through the form as if you were prompted to update your information. This is a special beta version of the form, accessible via the email you provided before its official release. Please be careful not to submit unless you intend to update your health benefits information for real.
- As you go through the form, could you please talk aloud about what you would need to do as you go. – (Participant going reading over the “note” information). I like to look through the whole page before clicking on anything. I like that I can finish this later. 

**Participant questions** 
- What are your expectations regarding the prefilling feature? -I think it’s awesome. I like the prefilled feature. I don’t have to wait time on information that has been there forever. 


### Things to watch for:

- [Does the participant notice the pre-fill alerts?]
- I thought I did step one already. This is a little confusing. 
- [Does the participant notice that the pre-filled information can be edited? ] -Yes. As I fill out the form, the information is being saved. Awesome, another 5 (Spouse information). I would expect to have something saying, “Why is it required?” I think it should be up to her to get her consent. That does not mean she’s, my dependent. Confidential purposes. Again, why do they want to know if my spouse lives with me? I need clarification on why these questions are being asked. I don’t see a reason or purpose for it. 
- [Does the participant notice that the household financial information is not pre-filled? ] -Yes. Having the drop-down list is clear. I’ll give you a 5. 
- How long would it take you to get this information? – My question would be, why do they need this information? My benefits are earned, I don’t see why they need this information. It would take me 5 minutes to gather this information. 
- [Is there any struggle with the household and insurance's multiple-responses pattern?] 
The VA should already know my VA compensation (from the drop-down list in the income section). This makes me think the VA is working with the IRS. 
Again, her information is not up to me to release. This is going too deep into tax information. I wouldn’t want to do that. 
This part is not clear. Is this for me or my spouse (Expenses section). 
I want to write “self” or have pre-filled (Insurance policy information). Do you have Tricare question needs to be yes or no because it’s your social number. I shouldn’t have to write my number down. You get a 3 for that. I would like a button navigation. It does not give me a choice (adding insurance policy).

*Do you go back and review? In this case, I would because I was confused on why I had to add the information. 

* Do you read the policy? Yes
-Session went over-
## Post-Task Interview - 2 minutes

- Is there anything else you would like to add about what we talked about today?
- Any questions for me? 

## Consent to use video clips

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that **you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?** Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
   - If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?
