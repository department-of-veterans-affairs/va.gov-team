Let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

2. When was the last time you visited a VA medical facility? * Last week. 

## First Task: [Notifications and Awareness] - 5 minutes

- Can you share any past experiences regarding updates to your health benefits information?
*
- Imagine you've been notified to update your financial information in order to maintain your co-pay and health care benefits. How might you go about doing that?
  
*I would try to do it online if not, then over the phone or in person.
* I would go to My HealtheVet app.
  
- Describe your preferred method of notification to update your health care information.

### Things to watch for:

- [If they have updated their health care benefits information before, was it in person, by phone, or by mail?]


## Second Task: [Wayfinding - Static Page] - 5 minutes

- **You'll be interacting with a beta version of the website today.** This tool has not been released and it may not function exactly the way you expect. Since it is linked to the VA system, it will show you your real information. Towards the end, I will remind you not to submit anything.
- For this next scenario, imagine you just started a new job and your health insurance has changed because of it. Now, you've realized that you need to update your insurance details for your VA health care benefit. To do that, you decided to search on Google to find out how and where you can update your information. Google takes you to this page on VA.gov you're about to see. For this scenario, are you comfortable with sharing your screen and talking through your thought process?
- Please be sure to close any personal information, like email, Facebook, etc., before you share your screen.
- [Share link to (https://staging.va.gov/health-care/update-health-information-1/) in Zoom chat]

*Scrolling through page, reading off information on the first page.

- Did you have any questions about the information listed?
*No.

- On a scale of 1-5 (1 being very poorly and 5 being very well) - how prepared does this page make you feel about the form you are about to begin? - Why did you give it that rating?
*5. Because it gives all the information you need.
  
- Do you have any suggestions or feedback for making the page and update process better?

### Things to watch for:

## Third Task: [Intro page] - 5 minutes

*I would go to MyHealtheVet on the app.

- [Share link to (https://VA.gov/my-health/update-benefits-information-form-10-10ezr) in Zoom chat]

**Participant questions** 
- Please summarize the most important information you found on the page to prepare for the form.
- On a scale of 1-5 (1 being very poorly and 5 being very well) - how prepared does this page make you feel about the form you are about to begin? - Why did you give it that rating?

## Fourth Task: [The Form] - 10 minutes

- For this next task, we are going to have you go through the form as if you were prompted to update your information. This is a special beta version of the form, accessible via the email you provided before its official release. Please be careful not to submit unless you intend to update your health benefits information for real.
- As you go through the form, could you please talk aloud about what you would need to do as you go.


**Participant questions** 
- What are your expectations regarding the prefilling feature? 
*None. Thats going to be accurate. 

### Things to watch for:

- [Does the participant notice the pre-fill alerts?] *Yes
- 
- [Does the participant notice that the pre-filled information can be edited? ] *Yes
- 
- [Does the participant notice that the household financial information is not pre-filled? ] *VA should already know that information. That is what I would expect (In regard to Dependent). 
* I would be unsure to add a dependent because you can't add unless you are 30% or more.
  
- [Is there any struggle with the household and insurance's multiple-responses pattern?] 
*No struggle. I don’t need to add additional insurance because I am 100% covered. 

## Post-Task Interview - 2 minutes

- Is there anything else you would like to add about what we talked about today?
*Not really, it’s pretty straightforward. I think older Veterans would like to do it in person. I personally like to do it online or over the phone.
- Any questions for me? 
*No. 

## Consent to use video clips

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that **you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?** Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
* I would of never been comfortable logging into my account and sharing that information. That’s very very personal. I would have had to decline the session. I’m more comfortable with the way you did it. 
   - If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?
