# 10-10EZR MVP UAT Conversation Guide 

## P5

----------



## Intro - 5 minutes

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?- Yes. 
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?**- Yes. 


## Warm-up Questions - 3 minutes

Let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

1. Do you have a service-connected disability at VA? * Yes. 
- If yes: what is your disability rating? *100%.
- If no, skip to question 2.
2. When was the last time you visited a VA medical facility? * Earlier this month. 

## First Task: [Notifications and Awareness] - 5 minutes

- Can you share any past experiences regarding updates to your health benefits information?
* About 2 years ago and it was pretty smoothe. I did it online.
  
- Imagine you've been notified to update your financial information in order to maintain your co-pay and health care benefits. How might you go about doing that?
* I would go to VA.gov and profile I would go to and dig down through there.
   
- Describe your preferred method of notification to update your health care information.
* Text message.
  
- How would you expect to update your information online? What specific steps would you take?
* It depends if you’re looking at benefits or healthcare. I would look at profile. 

### Things to watch for:

- [What's the participant's mental model around updating their health care information?]
- [If they have updated their health care benefits information before, was it in person, by phone, or by mail?]


## Second Task: [Wayfinding - Static Page] - 5 minutes

- **You'll be interacting with a beta version of the website today.** This tool has not been released and it may not function exactly the way you expect. Since it is linked to the VA system, it will show you your real information. Towards the end, I will remind you not to submit anything.
- For this next scenario, imagine you just started a new job and your health insurance has changed because of it. Now, you've realized that you need to update your insurance details for your VA health care benefit. To do that, you decided to search on Google to find out how and where you can update your information. Google takes you to this page on VA.gov you're about to see. For this scenario, are you comfortable with sharing your screen and talking through your thought process? * Yes.
   
- Please be sure to close any personal information, like email, Facebook, etc., before you share your screen.
- [Share link to (https://staging.va.gov/health-care/update-health-information-1/) in Zoom chat]
  
- You arrived at this page. Please take a few minutes to review this page and explain what the content on this page means to you and then what you would do next. 
* It tells you everything. It all seems straightforward. Not normally what I would do. 

**Participant questions** 
- How would you want to normally navigate to this page? * I would normally just jump right in. I would not read this.
  
- Did you have any questions about the information listed?
- On a scale of 1-5 (1 being very poorly and 5 being very well) - how prepared does this page make you feel about the form you are about to begin? - Why did you give it that rating?
* 5. It has all the information. Especially someone that doesn’t use technology enough.
     
- Do you have any suggestions or feedback for making the page and update process better?
* I can’t think of any. 

### Things to watch for:

- [Quotes from participants about any content on the static page that makes them feel uneasy, confused, or not prepared to complete the application.]
- [Comments about the terms used on the static page.]


## Third Task: [Intro page] - 5 minutes

- Could you please sign into your VA.gov account the typical way you would do so?
*(Participant logged in through ID.me).
(difficulites logging in).
- [Share link to (https://VA.gov/my-health/update-benefits-information-form-10-10ezr) in Zoom chat]
  
- You arrived at this page. Please take a few minutes to review this page and explain what the content on this page means to you and then what you would do next.
*(Participant scrolled down the page)

*You would need to know… What would deductible expenses mean? -I don’t have other insurances and I wouldn’t know what to look for. 

**Participant questions** 
- Please summarize the most important information you found on the page to prepare for the form.
- On a scale of 1-5 (1 being very poorly and 5 being very well) - how prepared does this page make you feel about the form you are about to begin? - Why did you give it that rating?
*5. Other than the insurance part that I don’t know. Or even if you had a W2 to help fill out the form, might make it easier. 
- Do you have any suggestions or feedback for making the page and update process better?

### Things to watch for:

- [Quotes from participants about any content on the intro page that makes them feel uneasy, confused or not prepared to complete the application.]
- [Comments about time and/or actions to gather information mentioned on intro page.]
- [Does the navigational placement of the new form make sense to the Veteran?]

## Fourth Task: [The Form] - 10 minutes

- For this next task, we are going to have you go through the form as if you were prompted to update your information. This is a special beta version of the form, accessible via the email you provided before its official release. Please be careful not to submit unless you intend to update your health benefits information for real.
  
- As you go through the form, could you please talk aloud about what you would need to do as you go.
* I would ready the information and verify and click next. Pretty straight forward.
  
**Participant questions** 
- What are your expectations regarding the prefilling feature? * Yes that would be helpful. 

### Things to watch for:

- [Does the participant notice the pre-fill alerts?] * Yes. 
- [Does the participant notice that the pre-filled information can be edited? ] *Yes. If I had a question, there’s a link and I would just click that. If you had (spouses) information pre-filled that would be helpful. 
*My son was adopted. He was not officially covered until 4 months after his birth. (Clarification would be nice on the tab of when they became dependent)
*Take me about 5 minutes to look for tax information.

-Other income?
* (Participant asked to see the drop down).
  
- [Does the participant notice that the household financial information is not pre-filled? ] * Yes.
  
- [Is there any struggle with the household and insurance's multiple-responses pattern?] * I feel like this has never been asked before (tax information). I was not expecting this but it’s fine. It doesn’t take too much time.
  
*Policy number? *(Participant asked to click drop-down to verify what her number was). 

-Page after submission? 
* Participant read the information and time frame of correspondence. I would not print this. Most military people probably would because so many records are lost in the military.  (Simple and straightforward for participant)
## Post-Task Interview - 2 minutes

- Is there anything else you would like to add about what we talked about today?
- Any questions for me? * No. 

## Consent to use video clips

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that **you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?** Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
   - If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip? No.
