# 10-10EZR MVP UAT Conversation Guide 

## P8

----------



## Intro - 5 minutes

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? *Yes
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you? * Yes. 


## Warm-up Questions - 3 minutes

Let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

1. Do you have a service-connected disability at VA? *Yes. 
- If yes: what is your disability rating? *100%.
- If no, skip to question 2.
2. When was the last time you visited a VA medical facility? *October 31st. 

## First Task: [Notifications and Awareness] - 5 minutes

- Can you share any past experiences regarding updates to your health benefits information?
  
- Have you ever updated your information with the VA? 
* Yes. I was at the VA hospital trying to get a VA Identification card. While I was there we were going through our information and that is when I discovered my phone and address were incorrect. In-person is how I did it. 

- Imagine you've been notified to update your financial information in order to maintain your co-pay and health care benefits. How might you go about doing that? 
* I recently changed my direct deposit, and I went to the VA benefits website and I did that last month online on VA.gov. 

- Describe your preferred method of notification to update your health care information.
* Text or email.

- How would you expect to update your information online? What specific steps would you take?
* Logging in and hopefully when they text or email me, I hope they put a link in there. In the email at least have instructions once you log in have instructions on where to go. 

### Things to watch for:

- [What's the participant's mental model around updating their health care information?] 
- [If they have updated their health care benefits information before, was it in person, by phone, or by mail?]


## Second Task: [Wayfinding - Static Page] - 5 minutes

- **You'll be interacting with a beta version of the website today.** This tool has not been released and it may not function exactly the way you expect. Since it is linked to the VA system, it will show you your real information. Towards the end, I will remind you not to submit anything.
- For this next scenario, imagine you just started a new job and your health insurance has changed because of it. Now, you've realized that you need to update your insurance details for your VA health care benefit. To do that, you decided to search on Google to find out how and where you can update your information. Google takes you to this page on VA.gov you're about to see. For this scenario, are you comfortable with sharing your screen and talking through your thought process? *Yes. 
- Please be sure to close any personal information, like email, Facebook, etc., before you share your screen.
- [Share link to (https://staging.va.gov/health-care/update-health-information-1/) in Zoom chat]
- You arrived at this page. Please take a few minutes to review this page and explain what the content on this page means to you and then what you would do next.

**Participant questions** 
- How would you want to normally navigate to this page? 
* (Participant reading and scrolling the page and reads the options on how to update). If it’s going to be quick, I’ll call the number. But If it will take longer, I will just do it online. I will probably go online because it’s 11:16am. If it were earlier, I would call the VA. 

- Did you have any questions about the information listed? 
* No. 

- On a scale of 1-5 (1 being very poorly and 5 being very well) - how prepared does this page make you feel about the form you are about to begin? - Why did you give it that rating?
* I would say a 5. I feel fully prepared. 

- Do you have any suggestions or feedback for making the page and update process better?
* It tells me everything if I need to update, I can do it from this page straight here. I have not thought about my financial portion that it may help/change my copays. It’s new to me because I've been fully covered but I guess for a person that is not; it may not be new information. 

### Things to watch for:

- [Quotes from participants about any content on the static page that makes them feel uneasy, confused, or not prepared to complete the application.]
- [Comments about the terms used on the static page.]


## Third Task: [Intro page] - 5 minutes

- Could you please sign into your VA.gov account the typical way you would do so? 
*(Participant searches VA.gov and logs in through login (first tab on the options). (Participant takes a few moments to recall log-in information). 

- [Share link to (https://VA.gov/my-health/update-benefits-information-form-10-10ezr) in Zoom chat]
- You arrived at this page. Please take a few minutes to review this page and explain what the content on this page means to you and then what you would do next.
* (Participant reading instructions. Stumbles on why she needs spouse deductible and income tax information). 

**Participant questions** 
- Please summarize the most important information you found on the page to prepare for the form.
- On a scale of 1-5 (1 being very poorly and 5 being very well) - how prepared does this page make you feel about the form you are about to begin? - Why did you give it that rating?
* 5. Because all the information if I’m doing insurance, all the prerequisites are there for me to do what I need to do. I’m just sticking with the insurance stuff and I would have that information already, I would just click “start”. 

- Do you have any suggestions or feedback for making the page and update process better?

### Things to watch for:

- [Quotes from participants about any content on the intro page that makes them feel uneasy, confused or not prepared to complete the application.]
- [Comments about time and/or actions to gather information mentioned on intro page.]
- [Does the navigational placement of the new form make sense to the Veteran?]

## Fourth Task: [The Form] - 10 minutes

- For this next task, we are going to have you go through the form as if you were prompted to update your information. This is a special beta version of the form, accessible via the email you provided before its official release. Please be careful not to submit unless you intend to update your health benefits information for real.
- As you go through the form, could you please talk aloud about what you would need to do as you go.

**Participant questions** 
- What are your expectations regarding the prefilling feature?

### Things to watch for:

- [Does the participant notice the pre-fill alerts?] * Yes. I love it because I don’t have to do it. It also tells me that they have the correct information on file.
  
- [Does the participant notice that the pre-filled information can be edited? ] *Yes. I didn’t know email and phone number was optional. I notice the information is saved with time and date.
  
- [Does the participant notice that the household financial information is not pre-filled? ] * Yes.  I would complete this form (the participant does not struggle with inputting information) I don’t know why they (VA) care about when we got married. I’m curious why they need it because I thought they had it already.
  
- [Is there any struggle with the household and insurance's multiple-responses pattern?] 
* ( Participant questioned who was considered a dependent). Interesting that it’s asking me for my dependent information but my question is why do I need to do it again. Why won’t it just carry over once I annotated that I had a spouse and my spouse is my dependent. If it was my child, I would understand but it doesn’t ask for child information. 
* I feel like I’m answering these questions over and over again. At this point I feel like I would of just called someone over the phone. 
*All of this stuff is interesting because I came over here to tell you about my health insurance and now we are talking about his income.  I may not have had his income information before I started this. That is the only thing that would make stop doing what I was doing.

- How do you think you would come back to this form?
   * I hit continue and it saved. Now I went back but it took me back to step two, not the last page I was on. I would expect it to take me back to the last screen I was on. Now I am confused because it’s asking my spouses income, and my spouse is my dependent and I don’t like this at all. I would be upset personally because you asked me to update my healthcare coverage information.
  
- Medical expense question? 
* I don’t know what that is but again when I started this, I didn’t know I needed this. You’re giving me homework and now I have to stop these things and look for this information. I’d have to stop and save this page and come back. I still have not seen the portion of the form where I have to update this information. What I thought was 5 minutes, is not 5 minutes. I’m not happy right now. 
* I would want to have an option that has “ update insurance information” I came on here to do step 3. 
* (Participant confused in the Medicare portion). I think this should be the first sentence, not last one. (From step 3 paragraph). 
* I probably wouldn’t ready the privacy policy unless I needed to. 
## Post-Task Interview - 2 minutes

- Is there anything else you would like to add about what we talked about today?
* Only thing is: I understand that I have to do the entire thing, not just update the insurance information given the scenario. 
- Any questions for me? 

## Consent to use video clips

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that **you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?** Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
   - If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip? *None
