# 10-10EZR MVP UAT Conversation Guide 

## P9 

----------



## Intro - 5 minutes

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? * Yes
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?** Yes.


## Warm-up Questions - 3 minutes

Let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

1. Do you have a service-connected disability at VA? * Yes.
- If yes: what is your disability rating? * 10%.
- If no, skip to question 2.
2. When was the last time you visited a VA medical facility? * This year for the first time in ages. I am participant in a VA program called “Move” (to help with weight loss). 

## First Task: [Notifications and Awareness] - 5 minutes

- Can you share any past experiences regarding updates to your health benefits information?
* I’m retired military so all my health care is covered under Tricare.
  
- Imagine you've been notified to update your financial information in order to maintain your co-pay and health care benefits. How might you go about doing that?
* Probably a letter in the mail, I don’t know what I would do. I would wait for them (VA) to tell me what to do. I’d rather do it online and submit my last year’s income information, something like that.
  
- Describe your preferred method of notification to update your health care information.
* An email kind of works but can get lost in the VA system. US mail really works for important stuff.
  
- How would you expect to update your information online? What specific steps would you take?
* If they sent me an email and sent a link to click, I would just do that. Without the link- I wouldn’t worry about it or bother with it unless they told me specific information that I needed to do it.

### Things to watch for:

- [What's the participant's mental model around updating their health care information?] * (Participant on an iPad and a little confused accessing the link and navigating). 
- [If they have updated their health care benefits information before, was it in person, by phone, or by mail?]


## Second Task: [Wayfinding - Static Page] - 5 minutes

- **You'll be interacting with a beta version of the website today.** This tool has not been released and it may not function exactly the way you expect. Since it is linked to the VA system, it will show you your real information. Towards the end, I will remind you not to submit anything.
- For this next scenario, imagine you just started a new job and your health insurance has changed because of it. Now, you've realized that you need to update your insurance details for your VA health care benefit. To do that, you decided to search on Google to find out how and where you can update your information. Google takes you to this page on VA.gov you're about to see. For this scenario, are you comfortable with sharing your screen and talking through your thought process?
- Please be sure to close any personal information, like email, Facebook, etc., before you share your screen.
- [Share link to (https://staging.va.gov/health-care/update-health-information-1/) in Zoom chat]
  
- You arrived at this page. Please take a few minutes to review this page and explain what the content on this page means to you and then what you would do next.
* I see that you can change your marital status or dependent information. (Participant scrolled through page) this tells me that the VA wants to bill my expenses of other healthcare expenses. Personally, being a cheapskate, I know the VA very inexpensive way to get healthcare. If someone was working, and reported this, they may not be eligible to be covered by the VA.
* I wouldn’t call because it would be a waste of time. 
* I would click on the account and do it online to update my information. 

**Participant questions** 
- How would you want to normally navigate to this page?
* I have to type VA.gov on Google because there is no app provided for this.
  
- Did you have any questions about the information listed?
*It doesn't say its mandatory (participant comment).

- On a scale of 1-5 (1 being very poorly and 5 being very well) - how prepared does this page make you feel about the form you are about to begin? - Why did you give it that rating?
*3. I don’t have any negative or positive. 
- Do you have any suggestions or feedback for making the page and update process better?
*Why? (Participant questioned).

### Things to watch for:

- [Quotes from participants about any content on the static page that makes them feel uneasy, confused, or not prepared to complete the application.]
- [Comments about the terms used on the static page.]


## Third Task: [Intro page] - 5 minutes

- Could you please sign into your VA.gov account the typical way you would do so? 
* My HealtheVet. I tried other ways but didn’t work for me.
  
- [Share link to (https://VA.gov/my-health/update-benefits-information-form-10-10ezr) in Zoom chat]
  
- You arrived at this page. Please take a few minutes to review this page and explain what the content on this page means to you and then what you would do next.
* I quickly looked it over and my first question is, “why would I bother filling out this information out. It’s not mandatory. 

**Participant questions** 
- Please summarize the most important information you found on the page to prepare for the form.
- On a scale of 1-5 (1 being very poorly and 5 being very well) - how prepared does this page make you feel about the form you are about to begin? - Why did you give it that rating?
*I’m going to preference it, it doesn’t say mandatory and stick with a 3.

- Do you have any suggestions or feedback for making the page and update process better?
*What would compel someone to complete this? (Participant asks). 

### Things to watch for:

- [Quotes from participants about any content on the intro page that makes them feel uneasy, confused or not prepared to complete the application.]
- [Comments about time and/or actions to gather information mentioned on intro page.]
- [Does the navigational placement of the new form make sense to the Veteran?]

## Fourth Task: [The Form] - 10 minutes

- For this next task, we are going to have you go through the form as if you were prompted to update your information. This is a special beta version of the form, accessible via the email you provided before its official release. Please be careful not to submit unless you intend to update your health benefits information for real.
- As you go through the form, could you please talk aloud about what you would need to do as you go.

**Participant questions** 
- What are your expectations regarding the prefilling feature?
* I see that there is only 4 steps and not 15 and that makes me happy.

### Things to watch for:

- [Does the participant notice the pre-fill alerts?] Yes. I’m happy.
  
- [Does the participant notice that the pre-filled information can be edited? ]
  
(participant confused on the steps, a bit misleading). (Participant doesn’t know spouse information). 
- [Does the participant notice that the household financial information is not pre-filled? ] 
* oh, more information. But I will fill out since it’s only two clicks. I would have to refer to my income tax for these numbers. It would take me half an hour to an hour to find this information. My husband and I keep our fianances pretty separate, so I don’t know how I would find this information. 
*non-reimbursement on medical expenses, I don’t track it because you can’t do anything about it.

- [Is there any struggle with the household and insurance's multiple-responses pattern?] 
* I don’t have any other health insurance. 

## Post-Task Interview - 2 minutes

- Is there anything else you would like to add about what we talked about today?
- Any questions for me?
  
(Participant wanted to hear more about the VA website). 
* The VA uses a secure email system that I guess some people need but for me, a regular email is good enough for me. 
## Consent to use video clips

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that **you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?**  Yes. 
Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
   - If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?
     * Nothing.
