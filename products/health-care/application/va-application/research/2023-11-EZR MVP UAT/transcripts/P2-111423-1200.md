## Second Task: [Wayfinding - Static Page] - 5 minutes

- **You'll be interacting with a beta version of the website today.** This tool has not been released and it may not function exactly the way you expect. Since it is linked to the VA system, it will show you your real information. Towards the end, I will remind you not to submit anything.
- For this next scenario, imagine you just started a new job and your health insurance has changed because of it. Now, you've realized that you need to update your insurance details for your VA health care benefit. To do that, you decided to search on Google to find out how and where you can update your information. Google takes you to this page on VA.gov you're about to see. For this scenario, are you comfortable with sharing your screen and talking through your thought process?
- 
*I’m reading how to update my information. Option 1 gives me choices on how I can update my information. I can phone, mail, or in person. I would sign into My HealtheVet and if that didn’t work, I would call. I would log into My HealtheVet and search my benefits. 
- Please be sure to close any personal information, like email, Facebook, etc., before you share your screen.

- As you go through the form, could you please talk aloud about what you would need to do as you go.

- Any questions for me? 
*No.
