# 10-10EZR MVP UAT Conversation Guide 

## P1 

----------



## Intro - 5 minutes

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? -Yes.
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?** -Yes.


## Warm-up Questions - 3 minutes

Let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

1. Do you have a service-connected disability at VA? *No.
- If yes: what is your disability rating?
- If no, skip to question 2.
  
2. When was the last time you visited a VA medical facility? 
* I had an appointment, but I needed to move it in New England because I would be there for 6 months which was in July. There is not much interaction with the VA on the West Coast and New England where I needed the surgery. I didn’t know how to transfer services. I went to a CBOK and once I connected with that guy he was able to properly schedule with that organization in New England. 
* I communicated with the travel Vet advisor to schedule and transfer information. 

## First Task: [Notifications and Awareness] - 5 minutes

- Can you share any past experiences regarding updates to your health benefits information?
- Imagine you've been notified to update your financial information in order to maintain your co-pay and health care benefits. How might you go about doing that?
* I would use the online portal.
  
- Describe your preferred method of notification to update your health care information.
*Email.

* I look in my password manager and tell you which address I use; I use ID.Me to log in. 
- How would you expect to update your information online? What specific steps would you take?

### Things to watch for:

- [What's the participant's mental model around updating their health care information?] *Calm. 
- [If they have updated their health care benefits information before, was it in person, by phone, or by mail?]


## Second Task: [Wayfinding - Static Page] - 5 minutes

- **You'll be interacting with a beta version of the website today.** This tool has not been released and it may not function exactly the way you expect. Since it is linked to the VA system, it will show you your real information. Towards the end, I will remind you not to submit anything.
- For this next scenario, imagine you just started a new job and your health insurance has changed because of it. Now, you've realized that you need to update your insurance details for your VA health care benefit. To do that, you decided to search on Google to find out how and where you can update your information. Google takes you to this page on VA.gov you're about to see. For this scenario, are you comfortable with sharing your screen and talking through your thought process? 
- Please be sure to close any personal information, like email, Facebook, etc., before you share your screen.
- [Share link to (https://staging.va.gov/health-care/update-health-information-1/) in Zoom chat]
- You arrived at this page. Please take a few minutes to review this page and explain what the content on this page means to you and then what you would do next.

**Participant questions** 
- How would you want to normally navigate to this page?
* (Participant scrolling through the page from top to bottom) I found that I can update insurance information and I can do this online if I wanted. 
*We have options to log in, I just find it confusing that there are 4 different ways to log in.

-Reason for the different login attempts? 
*I think it may have been a recommendation on the website
- Did you have any questions about the information listed?
  
- On a scale of 1-5 (1 being very poorly and 5 being very well) - how prepared does this page make you feel about the form you are about to begin? - Why did you give it that rating?
*5. Straightforward and clear. I scrolled down and that’s how I figured where I can put insurance information. 

- Do you have any suggestions or feedback for making the page and update process better?
* No, not at this point. 
### Things to watch for:

- [Quotes from participants about any content on the static page that makes them feel uneasy, confused, or not prepared to complete the application.]
- [Comments about the terms used on the static page.]


## Third Task: [Intro page] - 5 minutes

- Could you please sign into your VA.gov account the typical way you would do so?
*My healthy Vet log in, ID.me  ( to log into the VA). I prefer to use a code generator but I don’t remember if I have secured that in the past. It could be clearer by looking at the profile of the person.  (Participant chose text for the code). 
- [Share link to (https://VA.gov/my-health/update-benefits-information-form-10-10ezr) in Zoom chat]
- You arrived at this page. Please take a few minutes to review this page and explain what the content on this page means to you and then what you would do next.

**Participant questions** 
- Please summarize the most important information you found on the page to prepare for the form.
* *The first thing is that I am anchoring myself mentally because I want to make sure I’m in the right place to update insurance information.

- On a scale of 1-5 (1 being very poorly and 5 being very well) - how prepared does this page make you feel about the form you are about to begin? - Why did you give it that rating?
*4. Because it provides what information to know before filling out. But I want to know what to know before filling out the form and if I’m in the right place. 
- Do you have any suggestions or feedback for making the page and update process better?

### Things to watch for:

- [Quotes from participants about any content on the intro page that makes them feel uneasy, confused or not prepared to complete the application.]
- [Comments about time and/or actions to gather information mentioned on intro page.]
- [Does the navigational placement of the new form make sense to the Veteran?]

## Fourth Task: [The Form] - 10 minutes

- For this next task, we are going to have you go through the form as if you were prompted to update your information. This is a special beta version of the form, accessible via the email you provided before its official release. Please be careful not to submit unless you intend to update your health benefits information for real.
- As you go through the form, could you please talk aloud about what you would need to do as you go.

**Participant questions** 
- What are your expectations regarding the prefilling feature? * No expectations, I like it. 

### Things to watch for:

- [Does the participant notice the pre-fill alerts?] * Yes. I like it.
- 
- [Does the participant notice that the pre-filled information can be edited? ] * Yes.
-  
- [Does the participant notice that the household financial information is not pre-filled? ] 
*I guess I would go look in my income taxes and it would take me a few minutes. I would try and do it in one sitting. (participant used the drop-down to verify the “other income”).  I would need to look into tax return to see what that was (for the Spouse). (Participant used drop-down box for  non-reimbursable medical expenses), this would take some research because I could have deductibles and other information and that is randomly scattered around. 
* Something to consider is to mention Medicare Advantage programs but not Medicare.
  
- [Is there any struggle with the household and insurance's multiple-responses pattern?] 
*No struggles. 
*It would be useful to have all that information to show in the pre-fills, It would be helpful. 
*Might want to displace the answer of No so that I am not led to believe that is incorrect, (Veterans mailing address in the verification line). 
* I think the “update page” is in the wrong place. It updates my Medicare but changes the answer.  I don’t have an 11 digit medicare number but I have an 11 digit member id number.
-What would you normally do here, after submission? 
* I wouldn’t do anything, I wouldn’t print the page. 
(After submission, participant noticed answers were switched. No updates were saved). 


## Post-Task Interview - 2 minutes

- Is there anything else you would like to add about what we talked about today?
*Just a general sense to simplify, simplify, simplify. 
- Any questions for me? 
* No.

## Consent to use video clips

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that **you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?** Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
   - If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?
