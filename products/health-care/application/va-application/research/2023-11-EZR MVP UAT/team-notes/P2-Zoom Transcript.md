2
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:10.750
Katelyn (Moderator): alright. So I've started recording, and I'd like to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today.

3
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.090
P2: Yes.

4
00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:22.940
Katelyn (Moderator): and are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion to day to share with the A partners, if we remove, if we remove any identification

5
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.849
Katelyn (Moderator): associated with you.

6
00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.400
P2: Yes, that'll be fine.

7
00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.119
Katelyn (Moderator): all right. Thank you so much for getting through that portion with me. We can dig into some warm up questions. So my first question for you is, you have a service connected disability at the Va.

10
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.160
P2: Yes.

11
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.800
Katelyn (Moderator): okay. And what's your disability rating for that.

12
00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.120
P2: 70%.

13
00:00:52.590 --> 00:01:00.490
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay, great. Thank you for sharing that. And when was the last time you visited a Va medical facility

14
00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.050
P2: sometime in the past 30 days.

15
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.409
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay, pretty recent. Alright. Let's see here. So for our second task, we're actually going to be getting on a Beta version of the va.gov website today. this tool hasn't been released yet. So it's maybe not going to function the exact way you expect. And since it's linked to the Va system. It will show you your real information. Towards the end of the session I'll remind you not to submit anything or interact with the tool beyond what we're planning for the research.

I'm going to grab a link and share that with you in the chat. And so for this scenario, imagine that you just started a new job and your health insurance has changed because of it. And now you've realized that you need to update your insurance details for your VA. Health care benefits. So to do that, you decided to search on Google to find out how and where you can update your information. And then Google takes you to this page on via Gov that you're about to see.

And would you be comfortable sharing your screen and talking through your thought process for this next part.

27
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.010
P2: Yes.

28
00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:51.080
Katelyn (Moderator): okay. If you could make sure before you share your screen, just to close out any personal information, if you've got email or Facebook open.

29
00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.720
P2: No, I don't have anything open.

30
00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:06.200
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay, great. Do you see that share screen button in the bottom bar of the zoom window. It should be green.

32
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.579
P2: you? Said the bottom of a new window

33
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.209
Katelyn (Moderator): of the the zoom window where we're doing the video. There's a green button in the center. That's a share screen

35
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.970
P2: share screen.

36
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.030
Katelyn (Moderator): Yes, okay.

37
00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:37.230
P2: I have some hearing problems. So be patient with me. Please just let me know. If you need anything repeated, not a problem at all.

38
00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.079
Katelyn (Moderator): Alright! I can see your browser window. and if you click that chat button at the top with the little notification, the red circle that link that I sent you will be perfect to open up.

42
00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.080
P2: You better repeat that, please.

43
00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.920
Katelyn (Moderator): Here. So I sent you a link in the zoom chat. If you see that bar the top there that says mute, stop, video participants and then chat.

46
00:04:54.510 --> 00:05:00.139
P2: Let's I see you are screen sharing. And I say, stop, share.

47
00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:08.110
Katelyn (Moderator): Yep, above that there's another bar with some more buttons. Oh, okay. New share. Yeah. Right to the left of that is the chat. Yeah. Option.

50
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.029
P2: Yeah, okay, got it?

52
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.130
Katelyn (Moderator): All right. I don't see. It looks kind of glitchy here. But are you able to see a link in that chat window.

55
00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.699
P2: I see a blue button that says, Oh, here's a link here. Yes.
P2: alright! If you could open that for me. Okay.
P2: is coming up

59
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:04.030
Katelyn (Moderator): perfect. And you can close out of that chat window.

60
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.990
P2: Okay?

61
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:08.620
Katelyn (Moderator): All right. So I'll just repeat that scenario for you. So imagine that you started a new job. Your health insurance changed and you realize you need to update your insurance details for your Va healthcare benefits.So after that you run a Google search. You end up on this page that we just opened. And if you could just take a few minutes to review this page and explain what the content on this page means to you and what you would do next.

67
00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.350
P2: Okay? And feel free to think out loud here. Okay, I'm reading, how do I update my information? Option? One online sign in to update your health benefits information. So you want me to sign in

72
00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:06.619
Katelyn (Moderator): not quite yet. If you could scroll through the content on the page, just let it sink in a bit and let me know what it means to you, and then what you would think you would do next.

75
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:44.279
P2: Okay, option. One gives me choices of how I can complete the task I can sign in to my healthy bed. I use that a lot. or I can call in or I can mail in. or I could go in person to the Via here in Augusta here in Augusta.

79
00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:12.560
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay. just curious. What option would you choose if you were doing this task yourself?

81
00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:19.920
P2: I would try signing in to my healthy vet, I've worked with that quite a bit. If that didn't work I would call. If that didn't work I would probably I might try the mail, or I may go in person.

85
00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:40.740
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay? And how would you normally navigate to this page?

87
00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:50.990
P2: Probably get this information? I would probably log into my health event first and click on benefits.

90
00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:09.830
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay? So you usually start from logging into the site to find the information you need.

91
00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:11.700
P2: Yes, usually I do.

92
00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:13.210
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay. And did you have any questions about the information listed here?

94
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:21.760
P2: No.

95
00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:31.920
Katelyn (Moderator): all right, and then on a scale of one to 5, with one being very poorly. And 5 being very well. How prepared does this page make you feel about the form you're about to begin?

97
00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:44.950
P2: Oh, I'm comfortable with it. I doubt if I'll have any trouble with it. I've been through this some time, probably in the past, and usually these. These forms are very straightforward, and I don't have any difficulty filling them out when I pulled them up for various things.

100
00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:11.320
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay. So if you had to give it that one to 5 score, where would you land.

102
00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:15.780
P2: I'd give it a 5.

103
00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:19.000
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay. thanks for sharing that. And did you have any suggestions or feedback about making this page or this update process better?

106
00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.790
P2: No, it looks very well done. II can't say any improvements I'd recommend. It's really pretty simple.

109
00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:46.380
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay. great. Well, thank you for sharing that. We're going to go to a different link this time, so we'll have to open up that zoom, chat again.

111
00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.919
P2: Open up what, please

112
00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:06.540
Katelyn (Moderator): the chat window. I'm going to share another link with you. Just give me one moment.

113
00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:07.930
P2: Okay.

114
00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:14.950
Katelyn (Moderator): okay. I just put another link in there for you.

115
00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:19.949
P2: Okay, I see the word chat, and I'll click on it.

116
00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.790
Katelyn (Moderator): Yep. exactly like that.

117
00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:23.920
P2: There we go.

118
00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:27.289
Katelyn (Moderator): perfect. And it'll be that second link.

119
00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:28.760
P2: Okay?

120
00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:40.000
Katelyn (Moderator): Great. And yeah, you can close that chat window.

121
00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:41.850
P2: Perfect.

122
00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:53.490
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay? So in the last task, we looked at a mock up of the website. But now we're looking the actual va.gov website. If you could sign in to Va Gov, using your my healthy vet credentials. It sounds like, is your typical way to get in here.

125
00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:07.460
P2: Okay, I think I got it.

126
00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:10.330
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay. it looks like we've had a little technology glitch. So if you could open that chat window one more time and click the same link.

128
00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:29.000
P2: Open the chat window again. You said

129
00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.089
Katelyn (Moderator): Yes, yes, sir.

130
00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:33.510
P2: it doesn't appear on my screen.

131
00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:39.029
Katelyn (Moderator): If you go up to the top and hover it should slide down for you.

132
00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:41.709
P2: It did. Okay.

133
00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.090
Katelyn (Moderator): Perfect

134
00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:45.580
edit.

135
00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:51.009
P2: Now click on the link. The second link. Yes. -Oh, perfect.

137
00:13:56.820 --> 00:14:03.830
P2: Is that it? Yup, this is right. Yeah, we're in the right place, and you can close that chat window. We should be done with that. Okay.

139
00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:17.580
Katelyn (Moderator): okay? So in this scenario. You've arrived at this page after deciding to update your healthcare benefit information. And if you could just take a few minutes to review this page and explain what the content means to you and what you would do next.

141
00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:28.740
P2: Okay?

142
00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:33.439
Katelyn (Moderator): And feel free again to think out loud.

143
00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:39.459
P2: Okay, I'm reading it. And it looks like this general information income information from 2022 for you, your spouse, and any dependents you may have deductible expenses from 2022, so that would come off our tax return, I assume. And now the Va. Will determine whether I need to make a copay or medicines. Update the personal information phone number, email and mail-in address list, all insurance that cover me.review the privacy act statement. And if I need help, there's phone numbers for me to call or contact the local veteran service organization.
That's about it.

156
00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:59.960
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay. yeah. If you could summarize the important information you found on this page for me.

157
00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:03.200
P2: One to 5.

158
00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:09.229
Katelyn (Moderator): Yeah. What kind of what stood out to you? Reading through that page? What's most important? And then one to 5 score would be great.

161
00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:27.470
P2: Yes, the I think what I would do is. first of all, find my tax return from year 2022. I'll need that. And then I think we could probably go ahead and fill out the form. After that. I know my health insurance coverage already.

165
00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:44.450
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay. Yeah. So on that scale of one to 5, one being very poorly. 5 being very well. How prepared does this page make you feel about the form you're about to begin

168
00:17:58.130 --> 00:17:59.150
P2: 5.

169
00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:03.000
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay? And why did you give it that rating?

170
00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:10.100
P2: Well, I have confidence in the Va. And I've used when I've applied for benefits in the past. I filled out the required forms, and I really didn't have any trouble with them. And this looks like more of the same to me. So I've been through this several times, and I know that it's a good way to report what the VA. Needs, and I can usually fill it out without any trouble, and I've fairly well organized with my home finances, and I know what medical insurance I have kind of know how to get in the form from the Va. Now, okay. that's about it

176
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:54.130
Katelyn (Moderator): that's good to hear. Thank you for sharing that any thoughts on ways to improve this, any suggestions or feedback for making this process better.

179
00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:11.059
P2: No, I don't. I can't see any way to improve it. It's it looks like you folks have done a good job with it.

181
00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:24.110
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay. that's good to hear? So for the next task, we're gonna go through this form as if you were updating your information because this is a special Beta version of this form. We're going to be careful not to submit anything because we're still testing the form and its features. And same as before as we go through the form. If you could talk aloud about what you would need to do as we go. And we can get started.

186
00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:50.880
P2: Okay.

187
00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:58.640
Katelyn (Moderator): alright. So if you could scroll down and find that link to start the form.

189
00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:04.989
P2: okay, got it

190
00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:08.080
Katelyn (Moderator): perfect

191
00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:22.120
P2: step. One of 4 veteran information will save your application on every change. This is the personal information we have on file for you. My name lasts for numbers of my social security date of birth. Whether I'm male or female.

193
00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:45.510

194
00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:47.819
P2: It's a good service. It helps

195
00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:53.779
P2: saves a little time when you're filling out forms. If they can preload this stuff

196
00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:56.430
Katelyn (Moderator): definitely. Okay, we can continue to the next page a mailing address.

199
00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:15.709

P2: Okay.

228
00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:55.800
Katelyn (Moderator): so would that take you a moment to you. Find if you were filling this out

229
00:23:57.100 --> 00:24:03.459
P2: it would take me a moment if I if I was actually fillin out the form, I'd want to make sure it was the correct number.

230
00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:06.269
P2: and I could find it. But okay, spouse the date of birth. I think I know that now. I'm not absolutely sure that that's correct. It may be off by a day or 2, but we're just. It doesn't have to be exact at this moment, does it?

235
00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:40.390
Katelyn (Moderator): That's right.

236
00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:42.100
P2: Okay, we're just

256
00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:53.510
P2: Maybe 15 min.

257
00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:11.390
Katelyn (Moderator): Did all of that make sense to you. I saw you using the additional information about that other income section

260
00:28:33.290 --> 00:28:37.390
P2: on reversible medical expenses. Nonreimbursable medical expenses costs you or your spouse paid for these types of health care for yourselves. Yeah, what do you think of this information here? Is that clear to you? Yeah, it's not very high in our experience. She has good medical insurance, and I get all my stuff through the VA. As a rule. So it's not a very high figure.

268
00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:30.630
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay.

269
00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:36.010
P2: I have to pay some of the dentists because I'm not a hundred percent disabled. Hmm. health insurance. She pays health insurance medicare. I do not. I'll just give it a guess now to be eligible for Medicaid. Much am I eligible for that now cause all I have is the basic Medicare plan they filled in. No, already.

276
00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:43.700
Katelyn (Moderator): Yeah.

277
00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.030
P2: So I'll just leave it there.

278
00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:52.490
Katelyn (Moderator): Yeah, how would you verify that normally if you were looking to find out?

279
00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:56.150
P2: Move well, Medicare, I have the basic Medicare. I guess that's what it's called. but I do not have part B or any of that, so I would probably have to get in touch with the Medicare people to find that out. and that might that might take a while. That might take a while. Indeed, I'm gonna leave it at no, for the time being.

284
00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:25.810
Katelyn (Moderator): Sounds good.

285
00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:29.299
P2: There we go. This is already prefilled. Also people over 65. Yes, I am enrolled in Medicare part, a

289
00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:49.850
Katelyn (Moderator): perfect

290
00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:58.970
P2: or a effective date we're I assume that would be right after I turned age 65. They've already filled in November first 20. 8.

292
00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:10.230
That's the

293
00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:17.919
P2: yeah. That would be 8652008. Medicare claim number. They filled that in already. Also.
Okay, with step 3 of 4.
No. do not have other health insurance.

297
00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:59.590

311
00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:13.739
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay. We just have a couple of questions before we wrap up today. Is there anything else you'd like to add to what we talked about today.

313
00:34:22.810 --> 00:34:34.000
P2: No, I'm very grateful to the VA. They're taking good care of me, and I don't mind going through these forms when they need em.  I grew up with very little income. and although I worked all my life, I was in a job that didn't pay an awful lot. and after I retired I did have some retirement income, but I found that the health insurance will be very expensive for me, so I got back in touch with the Va. And told them I wanted them to take care of me, and they did. They? They agreed and gave me A. VA identification card. And since then I guess this was 1999 or something 2,000. I've gone to the VA. For all my medical needs that they will allow. wanted to do. and I've got to say they've throughout all those years. They've taken very good care of me. Also. When I got home from Vietnam in 19 69, a year or so later, I wanted to get some more education. So I went to the BA. And they said, yes, you qualify for educational benefit. So I enrolled at what was then Augusta College here in Augusta, Georgia.

As a night student I was working full time. but I did go to school for 6 years, part time at night, and got a 4 year degree. and the VA. Paid for about 2 thirds of my education here in Augusta. so I was very grateful for that. And then when I bought a home. I went to the Va. Again, and I got the home at a good finance rate, and no down payment. so I don't have anything bad to say about the Va. They they probably saved me a hundred 1,000 or $200,000 in my adult life. and I'm very. very glad that I was in the service. I didn't really want to be in the service. But I'm glad that I did, because of the great benefits that I've received since then.

330
00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:54.339
Katelyn (Moderator): Well, thank you for sharing all of that it's really nice to hear that you've had good experiences. and we're grateful for you and your help today.

Katelyn (Moderator): any questions for me before we wrap it up.

334
00:37:05.310 --> 00:37:08.259
P2: Well, not really. I always like to show off my book.

335
00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:11.810
Katelyn (Moderator): It looks like a good book

336
00:37:11.830 --> 00:37:13.790
P2: it is. It's a true story. I wrote it. After I got old and retired I had time. and I published it in 2,014, and it sold over a thousand copies.

338
00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:26.289
Katelyn (Moderator): Wow! That's amazing great retirement project.

340
00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:31.179
P2: Yeah, yeah, it was. It took some work. Well, we were a little different. We were army reservists, I say, we, we were a company of 150 army reservists here in Augusta. and they activated us in 69 and sent us to the war. So it was quite an experience, and I determined, and some of my friends who were in the unit determined, too, that we needed to record what had happened. and I got the job of doing it had never written a book before. but I wrote that one. and I'm glad I did. Now we got a permanent record of what happened to us in the war.

346
00:38:09.170 --> 00:38:14.270
Katelyn (Moderator): Yeah, that is a that's a service you did there, recording history.

347
