## First Task: [Notifications and Awareness] - 5 minutes

- Can you share any past experiences regarding updates to your health benefits information?
> Since covid more virtual, more tele health. Congested heart failure, long covid, lots of trips to the VA. Oxygen for a while. 
> ...A whole lot better with the help of the VA
> While I did, I moved once in the process and had to go into MHV and sign in there and update my address where they send my medicine and stuff.
> Didn't have any problems
- Imagine you've been notified to update your financial information in order to maintain your co-pay and health care benefits. How might you go about doing that?
> You know annually we have to do what is called a means test. Go in there and verify your income and make sure you are eligible for what copays and life changing experience, like married or dependents. And school loans, and things of that nature, go in there and update in MHV.
>

### Things to watch for:

- [What's the participant's mental model around updating their health care information?]

## Second Task: [Wayfinding - Static Page] - 5 minutes

- **You'll be interacting with a beta version of the website today.** This tool has not been released and it may not function exactly the way you expect. Since it is linked to the VA system, it will show you your real information. Towards the end, I will remind you not to submit anything.
- For this next scenario, imagine you just started a new job and your health insurance has changed because of it. Now, you've realized that you need to update your insurance details for your VA health care benefit. To do that, you decided to search on Google to find out how and where you can update your information. Google takes you to this page on VA.gov you're about to see. For this scenario, are you comfortable with sharing your screen and talking through your thought process?
- Please be sure to close any personal information, like email, Facebook, etc., before you share your screen.

> As I can see there are 7 different ways to sign in, I prefer to do MHV. They say my username and password save to my computer.
> Used others before and not as user friendly, have to add characters and whatever. Can't remember your login information.
> But dealing with your health information, not want to take lightly. That's why I use MHV, straigt forward.
> As I see there are 4 different options to update; you can do it online like we just talked about.
> Or speak to an agent and sign up that way, or request a VA from 10-10EZR and download and send it back, or when you go in person, you can go in and speak to one of the reps there and sign up that way.
> I would prefer to do it online, personally.
> I normally just stick to the information up top.
