00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:10.630
P10: I've started recording. So I would like to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

2
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.550
Katelyn (Moderator): And are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share the partners?

3
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:18.680
P10: Alright.

4
00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.829
Katelyn (Moderator): Great. Thank you very much for that. Well, let's just start with a couple warm up questions. You have a service connected disability at Va.

7
00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.310
P10: yes, I do.

8
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.209
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay. And what's your disability rating

9
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.660
P10: 100%

10
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:41.900
Katelyn (Moderator): 100%. Okay? And when was last time you visited a Va medical facility

11
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.160
P10: last week

12
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.990
Katelyn (Moderator): last week? Okay, very recent. Are you familiar with making updates to your healthcare information. Have you ever had to change your address or update any insurance information before?

15
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.069
P10: Not in a long time.

16
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.289
Katelyn (Moderator): not in a long time. Okay. typically, when you're doing that, is that something you would do in person or online, what would be your experience with that?

19
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.570
P10: I would try to do it online. And if I couldn't over the phone or in person.

20
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.820
Katelyn (Moderator): okay. so imagine that you've been notified to update your financial information in order to maintain your copay and Va healthcare benefits. How might you go about doing that?

23
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.990
P10: Probably through my healthy vet website?

24
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.769
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay? So you would pull up the my healthy Vet website and take it from there.

25
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.180
The app.

26
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.300
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay.

27
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:58.149
Katelyn (Moderator): great. And then, describe your preferred method of notification to update your healthcare information. If extra email, okay? And how would you expect to update your information online? What specific steps would you take there?

30
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:15.089
P10: I can't recall the app. But just maybe going into my profile and update information.

31
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.289
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay, go into your profile. That's where you would start. Alright. For our second pass. We're going to interact with a beta version of the website today. And this tool has not been released yet. But it is connected to Va systems. So it will show your real information. So for this next scenario, imagine that you just started a new job, and your health insurance has changed because of it. And now you've realized that you need to update your insurance details for your Va healthcare benefit. So to do that, you decide to search on Google to find out how and where you can update your information and Google takes you to this page on VA. Gov. that you're about to see. So for this scenario, would you be comfortable sharing your screen

40
00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.520
P10: and talking through your thought process?

41
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.089
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay, I shared a link with you in the chat. If you're able to pull that up and then share the screen with that link. And just one moment I'm going to grab some water while you pull that up.

44
00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:57.890
P10: Do you see it then? I do not see it yet. Have you started sharing your screen?

46
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.080
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay, maybe. There's a lag. Okay, I see the screen sharing is loading up If you could reload that page is that works with a refresh.

50
00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:15.730
Katelyn (Moderator): all right. Looks like the connectivity issues are extending to our data site here. but I'm able to pull it up on my side if you would like to look at it while I'm sharing my screen.

52
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:25.400
P10: Okay.

53
00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:46.150
Katelyn (Moderator): okay, are you able to see my screen? Okay.

54
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:49.190
P10: yes.

55
00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:55.690
Katelyn (Moderator): perfect. Let me know if I need to zoom in or anything like that. Maybe I can

56
00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:59.429
P10: expand this a little bit, so it's easier to read.

57
00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.730
Katelyn (Moderator): Look, oh, I need. I need that for me. Okay, there we go. So like, I said, this is a beta version of the website. We're in that scenario where our health insurance change and we need to update it. And we get to this page. So just take a few minutes here to review the page and explain what the content on the page means to you, and then what you would do next. and I can just scroll for you. So just tell me when you're ready to scroll.

62
00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:37.430
P10: you can scroll soldiers giving you options on line, phone or by mail to log in and update it for a person. What else am I doing here? Just checking out the whole page,

66
00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:11.059
Katelyn (Moderator): And thinking aloud, just like you were before. That's perfect.

67
00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.890
P10: Yeah, that's it. 4 options. I don't know what else to say. Well, there's more to the page. We're only about halfway down. Read each part of it.

70
00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:38.040
Katelyn (Moderator): Information. correct? Yep. we're preparing to do that by reading through the page.

72
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:46.630
P10: using a form update information. Okay. insurance information, personal information because it tells you how to update your information. Insurance

77
00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:10.910
P10: don't know what else to say. I didn't call a number. Okay.

79
00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:23.939
Katelyn (Moderator): so I know you mentioned before. If you're making updates, you would go to my healthy vet. Is there any other scenario where you might navigate to a page like this, and how you would do that.

81
00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:33.760
P10:  It just depend on what side out, what form I was using that day. If I was home I might put it up on the laptops like you did here, go to the site. go into personal information updates. verify appointment over the phone updated that way. If I'm in the clinic in person. it just depends.

85
00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:55.070
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay.

86
00:10:56.010 --> 00:11:01.089
P10: Did you have any questions about the information listed here?

87
00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:10.019
Katelyn (Moderator): Alright, and then on a scale of one to 5 with one being very poorly and 5 being very well. How well prepared does this page make you feel about the form you're about to begin.

89
00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:23.469
P10: 5, 5. Okay. And why did you give it that rating? It gives all the information you need?

90
00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:25.170
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay. do you have any suggestions or feedback about this page or any way to improve this process.

92
00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:33.510
P10: No.

93
00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:35.430
Katelyn (Moderator): okay. all right. we have one more. So scenario to go through. on the website. I know we are having trouble pulling it up before, but might try to give it one more shot. Since we're gonna go through the form together. If you could try to open up va.gov and log in.

98
00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:13.980
P10: I don't think I'm gonna be able to do that. I'm here because I don't even know my password. I thought I was just looking at a form.

99
00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:17.980
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay, that's okay. We can go through with some fake credentials. Let me pull that up for you. It's gonna take me a second.

102
00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:29.389
P10: and I wouldn't be comfortable logging into my account, anyway.

103
00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.729
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay, no worries.

104
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:20.929
P10: Was that doing something, or were you pulling it up on your end?

105
00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:27.210
Katelyn (Moderator): I'm pulling it up on my end. I just have to log in with the credentials we're gonna use to go through the form.

106
00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.230
P10: Okay.

107
00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:38.940
Katelyn (Moderator): okay. me share my screen. Okay, so

110
00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:49.910
P10: can you zoom in. So.

111
00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:55.450
Katelyn (Moderator): yes, I can got a lot of screens going on. Is that better? Or one more level?

113
00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:00.659
P10: No, that's good.

114
00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:02.780
Katelyn (Moderator): This one's good.

115
00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:03.710
P10: Yes.

116
00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:04.920
Katelyn (Moderator): did it? So we are still on a Beta version of the website. It might not react the way you would expect. But it's connected to the Va system just like before. And it's curious when you are logging into Vierakov. Do you know what method you usually use?

120
00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:38.370
P10: I use the app mostly. Is that what you mean when our

121
00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:44.139
Katelyn (Moderator): yeah, I was curious about whether you log in using my help event or id me.

122
00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:48.710
P10: Oh, my God. app.

123
00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:49.950
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay. alright. So for this next task, we're gonna go through this form we've been talking about. And as we go through the form since we're on a fake account, we're going to be Mark today there will be some information in there. I'm going to skew about the different pages. you go through and we'll work through this together. So just taking a look at this page here. if we could review this page, it's a little shorter than the last one, and and explain what the content on the page means to you and what you would do next.

129
00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:11.089
P10: You can update any personal information, merit or information, dependent income. spouse's information, or any personal information. Home address, any of that on with the farm insurance information.

132
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:27.169
Katelyn (Moderator): And what's the most important information standing out to you about this page?

133
00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:37.780
P10: Hmm. Probably personal information. I mean, typically that doesn't change too much. Phone number. email, mail and address. It's not typically something that people change too often.

135
00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:50.380
Katelyn (Moderator): And what about this page on the scale of one to 5, one being very poorly. 5 being very well. How prepared does the page make you feel about the form. You're about to begin

137
00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:00.269
P10: 5. It tells you everything you need.

138
00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:02.920
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay.

139
00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:08.450
Katelyn (Moderator): and what about any suggestions or feedback to improve this page?

140
00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:09.800
P10: No.

141
00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:21.950
Katelyn (Moderator): alright. we can get started on the form. I'm gonna click this. start your health benefits. or. okay. So if you could just take a look at what's on the screen and talk out loud about what the form is presenting to you.

144
00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:50.329
P10: what you would do next. Any expectations about it just shows your personal information shows you which if you need to update, if you want to call or just continue updating information.

146
00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:08.110
Katelyn (Moderator): okay? And what are your expectations around this? Information that we've filled out already for you.

147
00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:09.970
None.

148
00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:16.240
P10: Let's just give you your personal information. I guess you can verify it if you need to. but that's pretty much going to be accurate social security data burp on this most of the time going to be accurate. That's how they know who you are.

150
00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:27.390
Katelyn (Moderator): Right. Okay, we'll go to the next page.

152
00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:37.569
P10: shows your email and address same thing. Just verify it. Continue. That's not gonna change too often. But most people

155
00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:53.079
Katelyn (Moderator): okay. And what would you do if you needed to make an update here to this information? If something was incorrect.

156
00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:55.030
P10: just type it in

157
00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:59.789

P10: Change that marital status, if you need to.

161
00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:40.030
Katelyn (Moderator): And any expectations around this.

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:46.799
P10: no, that's straightforward. What's your status? That typically doesn't change too often. He update your household financial information. add a dependent remove one.

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:13.540
P10: who would be a dependent? Well, because I already know. But I mean you can click on who we consider. And I guess that'll tell you.

174
00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:29.879
Katelyn (Moderator): You mean that you already know, just from like interacting with Va

175
00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:31.199
P10: personnel. Yeah. about it. Yeah. that's what I expected.

178
00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:38.460
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay.

179
00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:41.049
P10: if you have that, yes, and continue

180
00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:45.080
Katelyn (Moderator): alright. let's fill this out with close to real information, whatever you're comfortable with providing if we're adding a dependent to the form

183
00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:00.010
P10: you mean. give a name.

185
00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:05.889
Katelyn (Moderator): Yeah, let's just fill it out as if we were completing the form.

186
00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:07.969
P10: Okay, let's just say, Tiffany. same last name. or just this, like Johnson. female or Miss. daughter.

192
00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:38.620
Katelyn (Moderator): I got the right number of digits. There

193
00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:44.860
P10: might be one too many, one too many.

194
00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:48.130
Katelyn (Moderator): Alright, and then

195
00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:52.390
P10: birthdays today. Well, for this year. Well, this day. 1990,

197
00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:59.529
Katelyn (Moderator): happy birthday to Tiffany. and when did they become your dependent

199
00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:05.720
P10: October. or when they become my dependent. I guess the date of birth right November 20, first 99. But see that that that's not clear to me. I mean, they're my dependent when they're born, but they don't become a dependent on your for your for VA. Purposes until you're 30% or more. So that's not clear

206
00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:44.590
Katelyn (Moderator): interesting. So you would be unsure about that. What? What to put there?

207
00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:47.799
P10: You can't add anybody unless you're 30% or higher.

208
00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:50.609
Katelyn (Moderator): I see. Okay.

209
00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:52.359
P10: it doesn't. You know what I'm saying?

210
00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:53.430
Katelyn (Moderator): Yeah.

211
00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:55.409
P10: what would you do

212
00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:57.090
Katelyn (Moderator): to kind of verify that?

213
00:22:57.340 --> 00:23:04.209
P10: Maybe call somebody or keep reading around and looking, or just try to add them anyway, and see what they see, what they say.

214
00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:07.430
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay. and what about these next questions?

216
00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:20.919
P10: So now. Yes and no.

217
00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:29.730
Katelyn (Moderator): Alright!

218
00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:36.379
P10: You have more, you add, or I don't, so I'll say no and continue

219
00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:38.449
Katelyn (Moderator): alright. We'll say no. and we can just make up some numbers here, but if he could breathe through this content. anything that stands out to you. Income, let's just say 300,000.

222
00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:01.270
P10: Why not.

223
00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:04.350
Katelyn (Moderator): Yeah. It was a good year.

224
00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:05.340
P10: Yeah. And income from farm property business, none of income, no deductible expenses. This and the amount he paid missus say, 10,000.

229
00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:46.880
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay, is it clear to you what nonreimbursable medical expenses are?

230
00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:49.009
P10: Yes, it is.

231
00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:54.919
Katelyn (Moderator): Is that something you're aware of just from interactions with Va, already personal

P10: personal experience. My own college or vocational educational. 5,000. No funeral burial expenses. you know. Yes. and you're a hundred per cent. You are.

239
00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:02.369
Katelyn (Moderator): What about this one.

240
00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:16.069
P10: Yeah, when when you're 100%, you are eligible for Medicare. So yes. you don't have to apply for it. But you are eligible to apply for a form of it. I'm not what it covers, or I got a notice saying I was eligible. That's all I know. because I really need it

245
00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:33.250
Katelyn (Moderator): for Medicare and Medicaid. These are actually 2 different pages.

246
00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:43.140
P10: Okay, yeah, I'm not familiar. I just know. I got a notice saying I could. I was eligible for either one of those. I don't know which one it was. and but I haven't looked into it, so I'll just say no, just to keep going, cause I don't. I don't know. Okay, if you're filling this out for yourself, what would be your next steps to? Answer? No cause. I don't need it. Okay, you'd say no, because you don't need it. Everything is covered. So I would need you. Don't need supplemental insurance.

251
00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:13.460
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay, thank you for that

252
00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:17.619
P10: same here. I don't. You don't need additional health insurance. I don't quite understand why, but I don't have any additional insurance.

255
00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:30.499
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay, cause you're a hundred percent. So you don't think you need it.

256
00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:35.060
P10: maybe later I don't know. But right now I don't.

257
00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:48.170
Katelyn (Moderator): Great. Well, we reached the review page, which is the end of the form.  we're done with filling that out. I'll stop sharing my screen. and then we just have a couple questions to wrap up there. Anything else you would like to add to what we talked to, we what we talked about today?

259
00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:15.579
P10: Not really. It's pretty straightforward. I mean, you could call. You could do it in person. You could use the form. I think older veterans would prefer to do it in person. You know, it's. I prefer. I don't like the phone. I prefer chatting. Or if if that's the option or emailing, or you know, using this process to just update it.

263
00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:33.079
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay. you like having more of a human connection or doing it online.

264
00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:35.810
P10: Yes.

265
00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:40.970
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay. Any questions for me?

266
00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:42.830
No.

267
00:28:44.050 --> 00:28:45.910
Katelyn (Moderator): all right. I do want to circle back, as I mentioned earlier to the video clip question. So are you comfortable? If we were to share a video clip of this session with our Va partners.

269
00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:07.650
P10: yes. I would have never so if I, if I had logged in all of my personal information, would have come up. I would have never been comfortable with that. So work because I would've. That's when I would have declined. I didn't know it was going to be in my personal account. you know. I thought it was just gonna be kinda how you did it. So yeah.

274
00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:28.230
Katelyn (Moderator): oh, good. I'm glad in this case that we had that issue.

275
00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:33.650
P10: That's very, very personal, you know.

276
00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:45.410
Katelyn (Moderator): Yeah, understand? We do. We do blur out everything personal. If we do share clips, because that's very important to us, is making sure. We maintain your privacy.

277
00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:46.560
P10: Yeah. I think if you have more meetings like this, I think most of us will feel more comfortable to do it. How you did it.

280
00:29:56.160 --> 00:30:00.199
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay, good to know. That's good feedback. Thank you for sharing.  Well, thank you so much for your time today, and for going through the session with me. Your feedback is helpful to us as we continue to work on the website and make sure it works for veterans like you.

283
00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:18.800
P10: Thank you. Connectivity issues. I guess it's the rainy day. My phone is perfect. My phone is 5 bars. So I don't know. Tablet is fine. It's just a laptop. So

285
00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:29.170
Katelyn (Moderator): yeah.

286
00:30:30.410 --> 00:30:36.600
P10: yeah, I'm glad that it managed to work for the session once we got you in here for good

287
00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:49.660
Katelyn (Moderator): perigee, and will be setting you a thank you. Note with a blurb, if you would like to pass that on to other veterans, you know, who might be interested in participating in future sessions, but just want to say thank you again, and enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you. You have more of these sessions available, or you mean for future, for future studies? Yeah, this is actually our last session for this for this study. But we have studies going on all the time. And they're they're very different all over the place, really.

290
00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:12.440
P10: So those are the emails that I that I get that I normally get. You mean, somebody would have to go into the the website and register like I did like a veteran. We have to go in and register through Peri Paragm. Yes, and yes, yes, they'll send you a note that you can send to them. That will explain how to do that to get registered with them. Okay, I'll I'll do that.

295
00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:38.579
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay, thank you so much.

296
00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:42.340
P10: Thank you. And have a great day as well.
