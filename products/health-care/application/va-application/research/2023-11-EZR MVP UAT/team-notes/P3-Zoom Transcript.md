1
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:07.959
Hieu (Moderator): I have started quoting. I like to confirm that you are comfortable. If I record my screen today as we talk.

2
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:09.250
P3: sure.

3
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.910
Hieu (Moderator): Okay? And then you are also com comfortable if we decide to use a clip to share with our veterans partners. Okay, great. Thank you. Kind of a long starting process. But now we're into the meat of it.

I start off with. Yeah, let's start off with a few warm up questions. Do you have a service connected disability at the Va.

8
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:36.900
P3: Yes.

9
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.709
Hieu (Moderator): if yes, what is your disability rating

10
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.750
P3: 60%,

11
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.630
Hieu (Moderator): 60%? Okay? And then, when was the last time you visited Ava. Medical facility

12
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.829
P3: yesterday. Okay, so very recent. Yeah, okay.

13
00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:02.069
Hieu (Moderator): can you share any past experience regarding updating to your health benefit information?

14
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.959
P3: As far as me updating the health benefit. No, I think that the most the updates are done by provider, you know I rarely have to. The last thing that I've updated. And it's not necessarily my benefits is like my direct deposit. But as far as my benefit, you know, my provider updates stuff, you know. but I haven't been in there and done anything. I don't nothing with even either dependent home address or email address, or anything like that as well. I don't think I think I always call. I think when I moved it that address I called and did all that over the phone. going in there and doing it. Yeah.

19
00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.790
Hieu (Moderator): And then can you expand on that experience?

20
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:09.829
P3: Yeah, I mean, it was just pretty pretty straightforward, you know, based off of my, you know. I just gave them my address, and you know they informed me that there was multiple. You know, clinics that I could be seen at best based off of my address. And stuff like that. But it was just pretty straightforward.

22
00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:32.289
Hieu (Moderator): Okay, so it's nice and smooth for you. That's great to hear so you imagine you were notified that you need to update your financial information in order to kind of maintain your copay and your health care benefit. How might you go about doing that?

24
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.290
P3: Well, we're probably okay. To be honest. I'm used to using or like that, E benefits. Right? So I would sign in there first, and then what I'm learning is that signing in it? It eventually takes me to the va.gov. and then I just search around for what? For whatever I need like. I said the most recent thing I did was like the direct deposit. So I went to the E benefit. and I think I ended up on the VA. Gov. In order to update my direct deposit information. I see. So that's kind of your comfortable route that you're taking good. Yeah, I'm old school, like I said, that's how I learned it, and I don't use it that often. So I just kinda fall back to what I started with your preferred method of notification to update these information either by email or text.

31
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:46.390
Hieu (Moderator): Okay, so email text, very, that's not bad old school with the mail. And then how would you expect to kind of update your information online? Is it just like how you described earlier, where you sign on to your e-benefit.

33
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:10.419
P3: Yeah, that's like I said, as normally, I've done it. Just yeah. Start on there first. And then, you know. I'll eventually end up at Va, you know. But I'm learning now that, like, maybe I should just start with the va.gov website. But yeah.

35
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.019
Hieu (Moderator): I see. For our next task, you'll basically be interacting with a beta version of the website today. This tool has not been released. And it may not function the way that you expect. Since it's linked to the Va system, it will show you real your real information. But towards the end. I'll remind you not to submit anything just because it's still a beta version.

38
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.480
P3: gotcha for this scenario. Imagine you started a new job, and you're kind of

39
00:04:49.510 --> 00:05:14.580
Hieu (Moderator): health. Health insurance has changed because of it. Now you realize you need to update your insurance detail for your Va healthcare benefit. To do that you decide to kind of go on Google and find out how, how or where you update the information Google takes you to this page on the va, gov, you're about to see. For the scenario. Are you comfortable with sharing your screen and talking through your process? Yeah, sure. Okay. Can you kind of close any personal information like your email or Facebook before before we start here.

41
00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.020
P3: I don't know. You know we have all kinds of tabs open up. Well, we're not even gonna talk about

44
00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:54.569
Hieu (Moderator): yeah. So I linked a kind of link in our chat here.

45
00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:01.980
P3: And then you did. You can click on that. Yeah, I've clicked on it. Let's you want me to share my screen? Yes, please, let's see a refine the hold on. It's not showing up. Okay?

50
00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.899
Hieu (Moderator): Okay? And I see your screen.So you arrived at at this page. Please take a few minutes. Kind of review this page and explain the content on this page what it means to you. And then what would you do next?

52
00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:51.960
P3: Yeah, I would probably scroll over here. Look over here to the left to see if something it's labeled my update address or something. then I would go to sign in right here. No, so let's talk about this page for a bit here. So it sounds like you like to go to the left side for the navigation bar and then sign in right away. Is that your usual approach? Yeah, yeah, once, especially if I'm looking for something specific. You know what I mean. Like.

59
00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:47.369
Hieu (Moderator): yeah. So that's how normally, that's how you see if it's over here, and if I don't see, I might click up here, you know, whatever. But I'll normally just sign in, because I know I'm gonna have to. And then, for for the purposes of this study, can you kind of review that information on this page can't take a few minutes to do that. and then you can talk out loud as you're doing this.

62
00:07:54.630 --> 00:08:05.330
P3: So when you say, review what you want me, just click on it or no, that center portion of this page here, this here got it up. Okay. okay, so how to update your V health benefit info, find out how? Uhhuh, how do I update my information? It's a direction, huh? You can update your finance, update your health benefits. Okay. sign in or create an account. Or you could do it by phone or a male or in person. What information can I update? Okay. I had a status dependent and pro income and full. Dr. Boy Spencer's personal info, which include phone number, okay. insurance information. How can I use this form to find out if my health benefits? Can I use this form. See, I'm bad. I would not be taking the time to scroll all the way through this stuff. Yeah.

73
00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:38.430
Hieu (Moderator): so far for the information you have gone through. Do you have any questions about it?

74
00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:47.039
P3: No, no, it tells you which is good. I think it tells you what you can and cannot update. You know it answers the questions nd gives you the different options. Yeah. And then on a scale of one to 5, one being very poorly and 5 being very well.

77
00:09:55.360 --> 00:10:00.119
Hieu (Moderator): how prepared does this page make you feel about the form you're about to begin?

78
00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:08.170
P3: I would say 5. I mean, it's pretty straightforward. Seems like.

79
00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:15.699
Hieu (Moderator): okay. And then, do you have any suggestions or feedback for making this page or process better?

80
00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:22.350
P3:  sign and create the phone? I guess the only thing I would suggest, and I don't know, you know. if people will remember to just keep scrolling down. You know what I mean, cause it's just a lot, you know. But if you're like me, I could, you know. But why does this form ask about when I finish kind of with the health benefits update. Or maybe. like this type question, it might can be once you are signed in actually on that form. You can include this like a frequently asked question on that part. Cause why? You know what I mean? I don't. This type question I wouldn't ask until I'm actually getting ready to complete it. you know, Gotcha like. So if I'm getting ready to complete it, then I might be like, Well, why d'you askin me for bout this? During the question itself during the actual questions versus on this page. So I think maybe taking stuff like that out. yeah, this, yeah, I think these type questions can be included on the actual form page. You know the shortness. So you don't have to keep scrolling and scrolling. You might miss something. Type of stuff. Gotcha. Yeah, okay, thank you for that feedback.

93
00:11:53.970 --> 00:12:04.520
Hieu (Moderator): It's very insightful. So right now, you're basically looking at a mock up of the website, we'll go into the actual website here. Could you?

94
00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:08.620
P3: You can exit out of this and open a new window?

95
00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:15.330
Hieu (Moderator): typically like, how would you would approach the Va Gov. I think in your case is VE benefit.

96
00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:35.810
P3: Yeah. So you want me to stop sharing, or let's see, let me stop sharing, and then I gotta go back. Yes, so I can see my stuff. Hold on. So what do you want me to do? You want me to open up a new page or get off this page, open up a new page.

97
00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:39.370
Hieu (Moderator): and then sign on into your your account.

98
00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:43.250
P3: You want me to sign into my account. Yes, please. My Va account.

100
00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:46.330
Hieu (Moderator): Yes, please.

101
00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:49.649
P3: Oh, Lord, okay. You want me to share my screen when I'm doing. okay, okay, hold on.

104
00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:05.900
Hieu (Moderator): or when you're comfortable.

105
00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:11.780
P3: Cause I know it's it's sometimes it makes people nervous. If I'm just staring.See? I didn't know if you need to. So basically, I just Google E-benefits. I'm ready. This might take a minute. I gotta do all this sign in stuff.

110
00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:29.239
Hieu (Moderator): Okay, yeah, that's not a problem.

111
00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:33.770
P3: remember, which one signing in with id means. I think this. Yeah, that's why I don't like. I don't like that about via you got these different sign in options like sign in with Id. Me and login Ds login is like, I don't freakin. No, I just one simple one. Yeah, if you can just have one option to sign in. cause I can't remember if I created id me or the other one. So yeah, now this, isn't it? There's an error on that one. Oh, man, listen came up with an era. So hold on.

119
00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.129
Hieu (Moderator): should think.

120
00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:33.020
P3: yeah. I gotta go find my passport. So you know. Oh, my goodness. Yeah. Course is not like in my password. Hold on a second. See? This is what happens. Yeah. You wanna take a few that I had to figure out freaking password. Let's see. Okay, no, it's this one. Okay, skip all these things. Okay. I don't remember doing all this now. Of course it's not working. How. Now I don't remember. I'm logged in and brought me up to my profile. Now I'm like, how the heck do I get to?

132
00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:47.749
Hieu (Moderator): Okay? So you are, but not where you want me to be. I'm logged into the Ds log in. That's fine. Let's see. Go to this location here. So I just gave you a link in the chat here, and then if you click that hopefully, that will sign you in to that location.

134
00:17:09.819 --> 00:17:12.940
P3: I gotta sign in. Let's see? Try to DS. Log in. But in the world. yep. hold on. I gotta send me a code. Yeah, my thing. Hmm. let's see. Okay. alright. Now I can share my screen. Great alright! Hey! This is real time right here. That's how it works.


146
00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:25.310
Hieu (Moderator): the more reason for to update the login for the research, right?

147
00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:30.450
P3: Were you able to click on the link that I gave you yes,

148
00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:31.660
Hieu (Moderator): it, yeah, it should take you to a different page. Not this one.

150
00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:39.190
P3: Well, it took me to a page where I had to choose the Dsl log on the same steps.

152
00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:47.770
Hieu (Moderator): Can you click on it again. See? Cause you're already logged in. Now.

153
00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:50.230
P3: right? It needs to take it

154
00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:57.179
Hieu (Moderator):  right. Click on that link again on the in the chat.

155
00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:01.289
P3: Hey? Wait a minute.

156
00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:02.640
Yeah.

157
00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:08.890
P3: I gotta stop sharing. I can't see the chat. I'm sorry. That's not a problem. Okay? So I clicked on the link. The second link. Right? Yeah. Yes. The second link. Yeah. I probably need to taking me to the same page. Do I need to log out or hold on?

162
00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:28.160
Hieu (Moderator): No.

163
00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:30.080
P3: Miss Lucy.

164
00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:39.210
Hieu (Moderator): Okay, great. We are here.

165
00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:40.400
P3: Hold on. This is the same page. We're just on slightly different.

167
00:20:47.880 --> 00:21:02.160
Hieu (Moderator): So the other page is, basically, if you were to search in the Va. Or if this one said direct kind of form, but maybe your confusion is a very valid confusion.

168
00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:06.400
P3: It looks the same. But yeah, yeah, I don't know.

169
00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:08.600
Hieu (Moderator): So

170
00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:22.149
P3: you arrived at this page. Can you take a few minutes to review this page again and then explain the what the content means to you on this page and what you would do next. Okay, so update my health information. But to know before I fill out Marilyn's status, dependent and calm. You and your spouses. Yeah. We use this information to determine if you need to pay a copay. I also will give this information. personal insurance information from all partition. So I mean. Archer. hmm. okay.

178
00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:18.570
Hieu (Moderator): So can you summarize the most important information you found on this page to prepare for the form.

179
00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:26.370
P3: Yeah, to prepare for the form. You was good, you know, tells you what you need to know before fillin out. But You know, when I read these 2 statements, I'm like, man, do I gotta go and get my tax information. You know what I mean, like income information or deductible expenses from 2022. So it's like, man, do I have to go and get that stuff? So would that take you a while to to get that information.

184
00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:54.300
Hieu (Moderator): Yeah. Who? No one has that sitting around. I mean, you know what I mean. So I would.

185
00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:56.470
P3: I will probably log out and then eventually get it and come back and do it. I probably wouldn't continue on if I had to stop and go get some other stuff. Gotcha. Yeah. yeah, tells me what I can update insurance information. See? This is where I was saying, you can possibly include. Well, why did they ask me about other insurance maybe include that here. You know what I mean, like on that first beta screen. Yeah, maybe send them. You know, we're asking this something like that there. But Start your benefits form 24 min, I mean, I would probably say something like, how long will it take to complete this form, saying, respondents. Burden. That's not that. Terminology is not terminology. It's a burden to fill out this form. It's gonna take me 24 min, you know, or you can just say, how long will it approximately take you to complete this form you want? In plain English, yeah, I mean, that's just kind of yeah.

197
00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:09.690
Hieu (Moderator): okay. And then on a scale of again, one to 5, one being very poor and 5 being very well. How does this page make you feel about the form. You're about to begin.

199
00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:21.110
P3: And I would say, at 3, because I gotta go and get this other information.

201
00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:30.290
Hieu (Moderator): Gotcha.

202
00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:33.889
P3: you know, I yeah, if it's not. Yeah, it's yeah.

203
00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:35.830
Hieu (Moderator): And then. do you have any additional suggestions or feedback? For this page?

205
00:24:47.170 --> 00:25:02.320
P3: Not like that. The start is further down. You kind of have to read it, cause if it was up top, I probably just click it without reading the rest of it. you know. So you kinda have to. But then, again, there's nothing stopping. Well, you know, that might can be a bad thing, because people might be like they don't scroll down. They're like what the heck is this thing on? How do I start it? So it might force them to scroll down. But yeah. okay.

210
00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:44.110
Hieu (Moderator): So for this next task. We're gonna have. You go through the form as if you are prompted to update your information. I do wanna know that this is a special Beta version of the form you know, accessible through the via the email you were provided before the official release. So I'll remind you again towards the end, to not submit anything, since we're still testing the form and features. Let's go ahead and click on that start. Yeah. And then, as you're going through the form. Could you please talk out loud what you would need to do as you go?

213
00:25:55.890 --> 00:25:59.529
P3: Okay, bearing information. I'm just verifying my social date of birth gender. If you need to update your personal call, your Va. Benefits. Hotline. Huh? So if I needed to update any of this stuff, I would have to call a different number. That's what that's saying.

217
00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:25.500
Hieu (Moderator): That is correct.

218
00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:30.679
P3: Did it say on the previous page, you can update your personal information? I can't remember. I thought it said something about that, you know.  okay. no comment so far. Okay? So you'll continue. Yeah. Ellen address live on. Nope. Address is right. Maybe it's good that it's pre-populated. Everything's right.

225
00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:10.579
Hieu (Moderator): Okay? And then what? What is your expectation on regarding the prefilling feature? Pre-population?

227
00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:19.999
P3: No is is good, that is, you know, I don't have to type it in. It's pulling from my information. So that saves time versus yeah versus me having to type it in.

229
00:27:25.450 --> 00:27:26.350
Hieu (Moderator): Okay.

230
00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:27.560
P3: yeah. Yep.

232
00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:33.690
Hieu (Moderator): Then you would continue

233
00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:45.649
P3: on an email address, 803. Yeah, yeah. Okay.

236
00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:02.539
Hieu (Moderator): okay, so you sounds like, you have no problem with this, either.

237
00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:04.179
P3: Very straightforward. Yep.

239
00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:06.230
Hieu (Moderator): okay.

240
00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:10.970
P3: Also refill so many information. Okay? Hmm. I guess when I see financial information, I don't think about marital status. But okay, yeah, household financial information. I would think that's like. I don't know your income, how much you're bringing in. But maybe you're gonna get to that. Maybe that this is just the first question, but it's good that is pre-populated. Married. Never married. Separated. Little divorce. Different options.

247
00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:01.049
Hieu (Moderator): Okay, so except for that little confusion, no problem on this page. Okay, I got you. Let's continue

250
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:17.320
P3: perfect. You had to. Who were you from? Okay. So it says, Do you have any dependents or report? Then it says, who are who we consider what? I don't? Oh, it's yeah. Okay. That's basically asking. That's basically saying, who do you guys who does to be a consider as a dependent, and that's kinda

253
00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:48.219
Hieu (Moderator): it's a little bit of an awkward yeah, it's kind of

254
00:29:55.440 --> 00:30:00.409
P3: yes, I don't know if it's the placing that's off. I mean, I see what you're trying to do. You're trying to kind of free answer the question like, who does the Dpa consider as a dependent?

256
00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:09.900
Hieu (Moderator): It's just. I don't know if it's the placing of this right here.

257
00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:13.660
P3: Yeah, but it threw me off. I was like, Huh! What? Who we consider? But just to be a I mean, I get it. But yeah. oh. well, let me see. Let me just make sure. My. if you're dependent is on marriage one of these under 18 or there between ages 19. Or they agreed with the current disability that happened before her. Okay. hmm, okay.

265
00:30:53.170 --> 00:30:55.759
Hieu (Moderator): yeah. Okay. Then, we'll continue that.

266
00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:04.570
P3: Oh, good! That is autosaves. Yeah, yeah, that's good. Huh? Wanna get booted out. You know that. You should enter all required information for you to PIN it, and only save your progress when you edit are required.

269
00:31:18.890 --> 00:31:22.649
Hieu (Moderator): and then enter em as if you're filling out the actual form the only thing that we'll ask you to do is for the social security. Just please make up a number

271
00:31:44.390 --> 00:31:55.030
P3: that might be too generic. But we'll give that a shot? Yeah.

273
00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:06.360
Hieu (Moderator): it knows.

274
00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:12.810
P3: Make it a little bit more realistic looking. it just has to look realistic. Or.

276
00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:25.410
Hieu (Moderator): yeah.

277
00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:39.430
P3: when did they become your defender. Okay. User. Independent living with the guests. with you in 2020 22. Yes. you're dependent on income. No. okay. oops Rodney. He should, in order of barbarity. Oh, okay. okay, do I have to add more than one dependent?

285
00:33:59.650 --> 00:34:02.000
Hieu (Moderator): Was that confusing for you, that it. This seems like it's adding a second dependent automatic for you. Is that confusing?

287
00:34:12.219 --> 00:34:14.879
P3: Yeah, it seems like it's asking for more than you have more than one dependent. It looks like the same information. I guess it's confusing for me, because I only have one dependent. Okay, right? So now, back here, I'm like, so

290
00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:33.179
Hieu (Moderator): yeah, in this case, when you're in this window, it sound like the first one. The first thing you did is you want it to go back? Is that correct?

291
00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:44.410
P3: Yeah. Because all of these things was required, and I wasn't gonna fill them out. So I was gonna see if I can go back.

292
00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:48.540
Hieu (Moderator): Oh, and then this button right here, says Counsel, and well.

293
00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:50.549
P3: but you shouldn't have to do that.

294
00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:55.480
Hieu (Moderator): can you elaborate on that?

295
00:34:56.830 --> 00:35:01.910
P3: So I guess this button right here, says Council, adding this dependent. So it looks like. okay. So I put in one dependence. So the next screen automatically prompts you for us if you have another. So I guess if I would have paid attention to this. But, If you don't have any more dependence, then maybe hit that button. Okay, I got ya. Let's go ahead and cancel, adding this dependent gotcha. you want to save your information

301
00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:36.800
Hieu (Moderator): that make you hesitate.

302
00:35:37.610 --> 00:35:42.409
P3: Yeah. So I just want to make sure that it added the first one.

303
00:35:42.590 --> 00:35:44.569
Hieu (Moderator): Okay, I got you.

304
00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:59.419
Hieu (Moderator): So it's not clear that it would delete that one or or not. Yeah. If you return to a screen. Okay, if you cancel, add in this dependent we won't say that you'll return to your screen where you can add or remove dependence.

305
00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:04.380
P3: Well, I mean, I guess. Let me ask, yeah. okay. yeah, that would. That's yeah.

308
00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:21.470
Hieu (Moderator): Yeah. That threw me off. It is probably, yeah, that

309
00:36:22.110 --> 00:36:24.400
P3: maybe a question about after is out of here. Oh. Well, damn, I answered the wrong question. Okay. it did what it was supposed to do. Okay? Sorry. I should have put no here. And then, yeah, that's what happened. Okay, that's what I was. Gonna say, maybe ask a question. If you have another dependent, then it'll take you to that screen. But where you add, Yeah, okay. So I guess you'll keep keep adding till you have all your dependents. Wow, yeah. So continue. Okay.

I don't know.

Gross income is going before taxes and other deductions. What are you? What we consider gross income wages, bonus tips, service pay. Now you mentioned that this would take you a while to actually do the form, because you have to find this information. Is that correct?

Well, I would probably guess, is accurate, as close as I could. But I do have a question. Yeah, it says wages. Now it's I'm retired. Is that working wages from a job? Or does that include retirement pay.

328
00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:15.070
Hieu (Moderator): Okay? So you need further clarification on the the wages prompt. There, gotcha for making note of that.

330
00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:17.940
Yeah.

331
00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:21.450
P3: So I'll

332
00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:28.049
Hieu (Moderator): for if you're not comfortable, you can just add a 0 just put a 0 there because we're just

333
00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:33.090
P3: okay. I'll just put 0. Okay. But yeah, I would. Probably if I was filling it out, I would guess. Like, you know what I mean, if I'm like, okay, if I may X amount of money times that by 12, and then I'll put that number in there versus going to find my taxes and stuff. So yeah. net income from a farmer product.

336
00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:06.020
Hieu (Moderator): Same deal. You would make a guess on this.

337
00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:11.240
P3: Oh, so okay. that doesn't come from a job. So there's a question. Answer, okay? Good

340
00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:20.370
here.

341
00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:26.290
P3: Okay? So it sounds like this question answers your previous question. Answer, Martha. Yes. Yeah. It did. Okay, that's good to hear. Yeah. Maybe I should. Hmm. Maybe you can save wages, not including retirement. I don't know. You know what I mean. So, but yeah.

349
00:39:56.510 --> 00:40:00.839
Hieu (Moderator): okay, yeah, thank you for that suggestion. Yeah, we'll continue here

350
00:40:04.290 --> 00:40:06.790
P3: outdoor expenses. No. I'm glad now, now I understand why this question is here. So it's helpful. What do you consider? Yeah. what do we consider non reimbursable expenses. I'm just gonna put 0. But when you're doing this for real, it would take you longer, because you have to find that information. But it tells you on that previous screen to have it. But majority of people ain't. Gonna go get that.

355
00:40:55.250 --> 00:41:04.170
Hieu (Moderator): would you? If you didn't complete that, would you save this, then come back, or would you just try to get that information completed here and now?

356
00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:09.599
P3: I would probably guess a number.

357
00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:10.690
Hieu (Moderator): Hmm!

358
00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:15.630
P3: Be honest instead, you know if I'm already in the Miz, I'm not. Gonna

359
00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:22.999
Hieu (Moderator): yeah. Yeah. I would probably be like, huh, did I go to the approximate? You know, the approximate, you know, type of thing.

360
00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:30.300
P3: college or vocational. Hmm. that's good. Say not your dependents. That's good. There are no expenses for our styles. Wow. yeah, you have to go. Wow. yeah, people will probably have to go and get this stuff, you know, you know. Yeah. So

366
00:42:17.170 --> 00:42:18.750
Hieu (Moderator): we can continue here

367
00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:26.010
P3: insurance information very well. oh, it's a different question. Admissions includes codes. Yes. on purposes as an effective year. Do you have health missionaries? Oh, so you do have that question in there. Okay. about the second health insurance. I'm just yeah. I don't know insurance provider. I don't know if you want me to talk it out. I'm just couldn't strike here and put my name in there.

376
00:44:14.970 --> 00:44:17.420
Hieu (Moderator): It's pretty straightforward.

377
00:44:29.490 --> 00:44:30.679
P3: Oh, that's good. that's good cause. I don't know that policy number. It's good to use, you know, cause I'm like, I don't know that policy

380
00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:40.450
Hieu (Moderator): for this one like just plug it in a fake number for now.

382
00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:07.320
P3: Yes, this information. Do you have more? No. oops. Just review my information. Yes. Yeah. no tracker.And then she couldn't services. You agree that you can contact me

390
00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:54.920
here?

391
00:45:55.150 --> 00:45:58.090
P3: Yep. we're gonna set up policy. Normally, I don't read these. I know. Yeah, yeah, normally, I just pulled down.

395
00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:28.900
Hieu (Moderator): And then if you go back to that window.

397
00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:33.430
P3: I guess just the tap.

398
00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:35.669
Hieu (Moderator): It's just the tab right next to it.

399
00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:42.600
P3: I don't see my tabs this thing across the top. Okay.

400
00:46:43.390 --> 00:46:57.539
P3: there we go. Yeah, yeah. So normally, you just click, confirm, don't submit so we'll we'll end it here. And then can you exit this page just so we can avoid.

401
00:46:57.810 --> 00:47:16.600
Hieu (Moderator): the submitting this. Yes, great. Alright, thank you. So you reach the end of the form. You know, we can stop this study here. Just because, like, I said, we want to avoid submitting that form. Once the final version, it's released, you'll be Prom. You may be prompted to update your health care, information. and the form may look similar to this, or it might change it a bit, just because the you know the final version. so thank you for that. Do you have any kind of overall feedback for that form that you just went through?

404
00:47:31.050 --> 00:47:33.169
P3: No, no, it's pretty. you know. It's pretty straightforward. You slow down, and you know, take your time, you know, and stuff like that. It ended up answering some of the questions that you know may come up. yeah, just okay. That's pretty straightforward. Just got to slow down, you know, like the dependent thing, you know, user error type of thing. You just have to slow down and just read it and stuff like that. So once you figure it out, it wasn't. It was pretty straightforward. Yeah. Once I figured out like, Okay, let me, yeah.

408
00:48:07.010 --> 00:48:11.700
Hieu (Moderator): is there anything else you would like to add about to what we talked about today?

409
00:48:12.050 --> 00:48:17.230
P3: No, I think we're pretty pretty good. Okay? And then, do you have any questions for me? No.

411
00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:30.789
