## Second Task: [Wayfinding - Static Page] - 5 minutes

- **You'll be interacting with a beta version of the website today.** This tool has not been released and it may not function exactly the way you expect. Since it is linked to the VA system, it will show you your real information. Towards the end, I will remind you not to submit anything.
- For this next scenario, imagine you just started a new job and your health insurance has changed because of it. Now, you've realized that you need to update your insurance details for your VA health care benefit. To do that, you decided to search on Google to find out how and where you can update your information. Google takes you to this page on VA.gov you're about to see. For this scenario, are you comfortable with sharing your screen and talking through your thought process?
- Please be sure to close any personal information, like email, Facebook, etc., before you share your screen.

- For this next task, we are going to have you go through the form as if you were prompted to update your information. This is a special beta version of the form, accessible via the email you provided before its official release. Please be careful not to submit unless you intend to update your health benefits information for real.
- As you go through the form, could you please talk aloud about what you would need to do as you go.

> If incorrect, a number to call.
> If correct, continue. If not correct, call that number.

STEP 1

> This is my home address, city, state and zip.
> Home is the same as the mailing, that is correct.
> I can finish this form later, I am hoping when I come back and click the link, I will be right at the same spot.

> Awesome, (the prefill feature) I don't have to input and waste time input information that has been there forever.
> If it is correct, pass, if it is different, I can change it.
> On a scale of 1-5, give you a 5
> I would love to have come up instead of me having to scroll up.
> Step 1 of 4, thought we already did step 1.
> I thought step 1 has my personal information, and this should be step 2.
> Adding email and info is optional, this is great.
> This is the same thing, I don't have a home number, I would put my cell phone number as my home number.
> I would add a second email address to this.

> (On spouse information page, scrolls down over each field)
> Again, why is this step 2.
> This is asking for my wife's information, Spouse social security number, date of birth and date of marriage.
> THis is a secure site and the VA needs that information, so I figure it is okay.
> Do I need to fill it out?
> I would expect to have something here, why is this required?
> I have no problem with my social seruity, but my wife's should be up to her to give consent.
> She is not my dependent, what is the word. Confidentiality.
> Having someone else social security number.
> Oh yes, I can make one up easy.
> Here, whenever you click something, moves to the next box automatically. (Date to year in memorable date example)
> Oh, I am still stuck on spouse. Ok, I get it now.
> {Pauses on spouse add info page}
> Why would they be asking this question? What is the differnece if I live with her or not?
> I don't see the reasoning for this question.
> I need clarification as to why this question is being asked.
> Like a tax break or something like that, 6 months out of the year
> I don't see a reason or purpose for it.
> Clarification before that 5 is earned.

Dependents
> I am glad you have this to clarify (add info component who is a dependent)
> Awesome
> (Selects No)
> It is clear
> If you just left it yes and no, it would be incomplete.
> The drop down that explains what you are looking for, makes it clear. 5

INCOME
> First of all, I want to know why they want my information
> I don't give no one my information but my wife.
> What does this have to do with my VA benefits.

> Why is this here? Want to know how much i make from VA compensation.
> Why are you asking for something you already have?
> For retirement, you can have more than one job and retirement benefits.
> Oh my god. This makes me think you guys are working with the IRS. That is how it feels.

> What if you hit enter by mistake and don't realize you went to a second page.
> You have to tell me to hit enter or continue.

STEP 3

> January 2022 that is correct.
> (scrolling over medicare claim number)
> Okay, so they , okay it's clear. 5
> Do you have health insurance to add
> All the health insurance, something
> I guess for me, I have never seen it that way. Always been do you have Other health insurance.
> You got a 3 on that one (add insurance page)

Policy Page
- Can I write self instead of my full name?
- I want that changed - why the full whole name when I can just write self and move to the next question.
- And for Tricare, they should know that is your social security number. You already asked at the begining, you have this.
- You already have my social.
- You know what I am saying right?
- You got another 3 there
- And also, before I ask, ... (reads through page)
- What is this (goes to policy page, was autoselected to YES previously)
- The previous one asked for you health insurance, but didn't ask if you have more than one.
- Bringing me here, I would be confused. What if I don't have a health insurance, it didn't take my information and I need to redo it again.
- It is confusing.
- Here, it says if you don't have insurance, click on next page.
- I would like to have a button up here, if you don't have another insurance, click here, and it moves you to the next page.
- Right now, you are telling me to continue or go back or cancel. It is not giving me a choice.
- (reads through cancel adding modal) Now that is confusing.. will this cancel the previous one I did, or just the page I am on now.
- (walked through how to change radio selection to no to proceed)
