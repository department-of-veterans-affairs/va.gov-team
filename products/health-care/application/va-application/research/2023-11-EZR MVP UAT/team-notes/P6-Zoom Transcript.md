2
00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:11.320
P6: Yes.

3
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:17.470
Hieu (Moderator): okay, great. And then, are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion to day to share with other Va partner as we remove any. And then, after we remove any identifying information. Okay, great. Thank you for that. We move on to the actual study. Now we'll start with a few warm up questions. Do you have a service connected disability at the VA.

8
00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.580
P6: Yeah. I have a sas sleep Ab there to lives. And then what is your disability rating?

11
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:59.429
Hieu (Moderator): 10? Okay? And then, when was the last time you visited Ava medical facility.

12
00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.750
P6: I actually have appointment Monday. But it's been.

13
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:11.870
Hieu (Moderator): It's been about a mile a month. You said, Yes, sir, okay, so very recent. So can you share any past experience in regards to updating your health. Benefit information. I'm sorry. I think you're on mute there.

17
00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.060
P6: Well, since Covid oh. hold on a minute. Sorry about that. Since since Covid. a lot of this stuff has been more virtual, more like telehealth. But you know, Covid, affected me tremendously. I had a congestive heart failure at what was called Long Covid. So I had. I had to, you know, make a lot more trips to the Va. So I had to make sure that I was on oxygen there for a while, and my eject ejection fraction rate was actually, I got down to like 30%. But with the help of you know, my. there are you know. they help me out a lot, and I was able to get it back up to over 50. I got my sleep amnesty intact. I'm using my seatpab machine regularly, so came came along. a whole lot better with the help of the Va. So I do. I am thankful for that.

33
00:02:50.960 --> 00:03:00.740
Hieu (Moderator): Always good to hear that. I, in regards to your past experience, like updating your information like address, insurance. Do you have any thing of that nature?

35
00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.070
P6: Well, I did have a. I have moved once in the process, and all the thing I had to do was go into my health. My healthy vet and sign in there and update my address to where they send my medicine and stuff. So I didn't have any problems.

39
00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.100
Hieu (Moderator): Okay? So it's very straightforward for you.

40
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.969
P6: Yes, sir.

41
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:42.319
Hieu (Moderator): Imagine you have been notified to to update your financial information in order to maintain your copay and your healthcare benefit. How might you go about doing this?

43
00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:55.870
P6: No, annually. We have to do what like is called a means test. So we have to go, and, you know, have you go in there and verify your income to make sure that you're. you know, eligible, you know. or you know. wh. What? Whatever Co. Pays that you have before like? Do you have any life live life, changing experience such as you got married, or you had dependents, or whatever. I know me. I had a lot of school loans, and you know a medical payment. So you know things that nature you had to go in there and update that stuff in in the my healthy vet.

48
00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.350
Hieu (Moderator): so a very similar process to before it sounds like. And then so it's also very straightforward as well. Okay, that's good to hear. Can you describe your preferred method of notification to update your health care information.

52
00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:55.719
P6: Well. actually, I work in the health care industry, you know. And civilians are. Yeah, I'm pretty familiar with it. But so I try to stay proactive, you know, to make sure that I get by proper benefits that's needed. So you know, I always laugh. Starved out. Keep the you know. proper records of everything, you know that's needed that part. I won't have any, you know, setbacks of any kind. We have a

57
00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:24.699
Hieu (Moderator): and then, in terms of your notification preference. You don't really have one then.

58
00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.350
P6: Well, I prefer. I pray, email. I prefer. III like email is my proud where I like to be notified.

62
00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.719
Hieu (Moderator): Can you? Elaborate on that

63
00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:55.120
P6: whenever they, whenever I need to be contacted that could, you know. send an email, a message to my email. Then I can respond back to em. You're saying or go to my, you know my message. I have, you know, gone to my inbox and compose a message or anything like, for instance. I

66
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.530
you know, like like I mentioned 2 years I had a

67
00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:13.150
P6: Jessica Harper. You also have A mobility scooter! While my scooter had broke down Recently. So I had send him a message an let em know that I, the you know, my company that was working on my scooter had some issues so that patient advocate make them become aware of the situation. Therefore, you know, II don't be big on Scooter for long. So that was that was very helpful.

74
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:42.109
Hieu (Moderator): And then you prefer that communication through email. Correct, gotcha. Thank you for that. And then, when you want to update your information online, what specific steps do you take? Is it like you said before, with the mind healthy. Vet approach. Yeah, I mainly deal with my health to deck, and sometime when you call in, you know.

77
00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.669
P6: you know, they transfer you here and there, or you know, it might like, say, I work on the phone all day, so I may not have the time. You know what I'm saying to contact them over the phone. So I, you know. But I can, you know, shoot them an email, or whatever they can be able to get back with me, or at my earliest convenience, I can always check my email. Right? That makes sense. Yes, sir.

82
00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:32.449
Hieu (Moderator): thank you for that feedback. And then for the next task. You'll be interacting with a beta version of a website today. This tool has not been released. And it might may not function exactly the way you expect it to. since it is linked to the Va system, it will show you your real information. So towards the end I'll remind you not to submit anything just because it is linked to the VA. System.

85
00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:51.080
P6: Okay.

86
00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:59.460
Hieu (Moderator): for this next serial scenario. Imagine you just started a new job, and your healthcare has changed because of that. Now you realize that you need to update your insurance information for the Va healthcare benefit to do that, you decide to go on Google to find where you can update your information Google takes to takes you to this page on Va. Gov, that you're about to see for this scenario. Are you comfortable with sharing your screen and talking through your process?

89
00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:21.909
P6: Yes, sir.

90
00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:27.899
Hieu (Moderator): okay, please be sure to close any personal information like email and Facebook. And then I will send you a link in the Zoom chat. Here let me find the chat window and pasting.

94
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:12.470
P6: Can can you see this screen? I cannot. So are you able to. I mean, could you? You you need you need to see it, though correct.

95
00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:18.890
Hieu (Moderator): That is correct. In your zoom window there is a shared screen button on the bottom.

96
00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:22.190
P6: It's a green button. Okay, got it. And I'm looking at screen. 1, 2. I can see it now. Yes, I can see it now. Me might get bigger.

101
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:51.180
Hieu (Moderator): Okay, great.

102
00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.490
P6: Did you need me to sign in?

103
00:09:53.580 --> 00:10:06.630
Hieu (Moderator): No, not yet. So you have Ri arrived on this page. Please take a few minutes to review this page and explain what the content on this page means to you and what you would naturally do next.

104
00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:19.899
P6: Okay? this gives basic information on how to how to sign in to update your your Va. Health benefits. Information. you know, like gives you information such as eligibility. If you want to know. maybe, how about like add the dependent, or whatever it tells you how to apply. and it gives you information on. Apply now and then what happens after you apply then, also, like you said family health. and then you can also going here and manage benefits. And there's also spot for more resources in case you needed added resources.

111
00:10:50.830 --> 00:11:00.639
Hieu (Moderator): Now, it sounds like the first thing you do is you go over to left navigation and read through. That is that your natural instinct? Okay. for our study. We wanna see if you can focus on the center piece. on the that's the main content. And then can you take a few minutes to kind of read through that, and just kind of

115
00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:17.019
P6: talk about your thoughts out loud. as I can see. You know there's several different ways that you can find in. You could do login.gov you do. Addie, that made this log in, or my healthy vet. I prefer to do my healthy vet, because as to some that that I'm used to, and they say they saved my username and password. I save it to my computer. some of the I've used some other stuff before this more not as user friendly, because you have to at characters and different things as us to try to log in. It's kinda harder to try to remember. You know, you log in information, and sometimes that'll deter you. If you can't remember your username and password. Then you know you just sometime you might just log off the site entirely, but been dealing with your help information. That's that's not something that you wanna take lightly. So that's why I prefer my healthy vet, cause it's this. you know. Straight forward

128
00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:32.899
Hieu (Moderator): I got you, and then that's where you also save your information or save your kind of password as well. I see. And then can you scroll down a little bit here?

130
00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:40.359
Hieu (Moderator): Can you kind of continue your thought process as well.

131
00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:43.830
P6: Now, there's a as I see. There's a 4 different options. In order to update your information. you could do it online as we just spoke about. or you could actually call the Health Eligibility Center. and it's like option one Monday to party from 8 to 8 and speak to an agent and sign up that way. or you can have request a be a form. 10, dash 10 EZR, and get that form and download it and send it back to the address listed off out in Atlanta, Georgia. or actually, when you go in person to the VA. You can laugh. You can go in and in a speak to one of the reps there and and sign up that way.

141
00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:43.589
Hieu (Moderator): And now, typically, when you go to one of these pages. Do you just like to stay at the top? Or do you actually scroll through like, naturally for you?

142
00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:53.189
P6: Why, me nestle says I, bear worked on computers a lot I normally just. I would prefer prefer to do it online, me personally. Then I could maybe go

145
00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:06.920
Hieu (Moderator): Gotcha. And then but I meant in terms of navigating on the web page itself. Do you normally just see the information on the top? Or do you actually.slowly?

148
00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:35.300
P6: Okay, I know some people are not. That's computer savvy. So you know, you get a lot of older vets and stuff. And they don't. You know, they don't feel comfortable using computers so they might need help. You know, I'm saying that update the information. So at the bottom, you know, there's a a spot where you can work with the Roma specialists, you know, to get help, you know that. Answer some questions about yourself to to get you enrolled. Therefore. you know, like, say you'd be proactive and won't won't get behind, or, you know. going to deep out trying to get any of your benefits or whatever I gotcha. But typically for you, you don't really screw down here. You stick to top. do this type of work in my regular job, so I'm pretty familiar with it. I gotcha, and you're very comfortable with it as well. That is correct

159
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.720
Hieu (Moderator): at. Do you have any questions about the information listed so far?

160
00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:45.660
P6: No, I was pretty grateful for what I mean. I said. Health insurance is something that we all have to do yearly. So I mean, if you did it once, then you should be able to do it again. You have to.

164
00:15:58.170 --> 00:16:08.569
Hieu (Moderator): Okay, and then on a scale of one to 5, one being very poor and 5 being very well. How prepared does this page make you feel about the form you are about to begin?

165
00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:10.030
P6: I'll say 5,

166
00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:14.739
Hieu (Moderator): 5. Okay, it. And then what is the reason for that.

167
00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:19.130
P6: because it's user friendly, it's straightforward. And it gives you it's it pays attention to detail to give you all the information that that is required in order to complete this process. Okay, that's good to hear. And then do you have any suggestions or feedback from making this page or update process better. No, because er what I like about is like. if you have any questions or whatever I'd like, I like to find a lot of the stuff is highlighted to tell you. You know where where to go to. If you'd like to say if you need it. you know how you can use the form, or you know what information you need to update, or whatever some is highlight to tell you what to go to. I Gotcha, so very straightforward for you. No problem.

177
00:17:08.369 --> 00:17:16.669
Hieu (Moderator): So this this page is a mock up of the website. So now we'll move on to the actual website. Could you please open a new window and basically sign on to your Va. Gov. Normally how you would. And it sounded like you would go through the my healthy vet route. Yeah. No, don't. This is that. Yeah, this is a you can do a new window if you're comfortable with that.

182
00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:12.499
P6: did you switch windows.

183
00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:15.460
Hieu (Moderator): Yeah, I see the switch windows

184
00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:19.589
P6: when we sign in there. Yes, please. A since you can see I have my Well, you don't need to see that. If you want to see that. Well, you can see my password. But but username and password is already  pre-populated, and then I have a it actually, you know, to complete the sign in, I normally use the text messages. Thehadn't sent me a code to my phone. Yeah, so I'll go ahead and select that I know in the past I had a few times had a contacting because I had to switch phones. so I had to change my by phone, telephone or file. Let's see.

195
00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:12.110
Hieu (Moderator): Okay, since you are sign in, I'll give you another link that you should now be able to access because you are sign in.

196
00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:15.369

P6: And then you your growth and your income. I guess. I don't know if you'd refer back to you previous taxes, or whatever. But I mean I mean I could. I could pretty much figure out. You know what I make, so I will put. I will put that in there.

317
00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.919
Hieu (Moderator): So would this take you a long time to figure out in terms of

318
00:34:56.980 --> 00:35:07.819
P6: dial like, Oh, my! On my computer at work. I can go in there, and I could pull up a pay stub, or either just go on there, and it tells me what I make. both by bi-weekly and annually. Okay, so it's pretty a quick process for you to find this information correct, correct

321
00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:21.969
Hieu (Moderator): gotcha for our purposes. I'm just gonna put it 0.

322
00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:35.640
P6: And then if you own a farm or property or business. you put that income. But this is again, it's gonna be 0. And then say, for instance, you might have child support, or some of that night you if you had that, you'd put that as other income. But in this case it's gonna be 0, and then you'll continue correct.

325
00:35:54.050 --> 00:35:55.180

So let's put.

334
00:36:49.090 --> 00:36:54.620

00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:58.290
P6: It's pretty simple, I mean, yeah, you got it. There's always ways to find find it. That's correct.
