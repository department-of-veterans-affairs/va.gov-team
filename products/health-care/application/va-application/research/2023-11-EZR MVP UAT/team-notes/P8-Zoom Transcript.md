00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:11.689
P8: Hey? So just to confirm once more, now that we're recording, are you comfortable? If I record my screen and audio as we talk today.

2
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:21.989
Perigean: Okay and are you comfortable? If we decided to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with our Va partners if we remove any identifying information.

3
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.650
Yes.

4
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:31.120
Perigean: Okay, great. Thank you. So much for your patience. We can get into our actual talk today. Now. So a couple of questions before we start looking at any of the website. Do you have a service connected disability at? Va.

6
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.410
P8: yes.

7
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.519
Perigean: okay. And what is your disability rating. Okay, when was the last time you visited a Va medical facility

9
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.299
and October 30 first.

10
00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.940
Perigean: and I'll eat alright. Thank you. Have you ever had to update your health benefits information with the Va.

12
00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.659
P8: Are you saying, How do?

13
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.300
How do you mean

14
00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.640
Perigean: do you remember ever being asked to like. update your address, or, you know, having to do that proactively yourself, your address, your contact information, your health insurance information.

16
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:40.200
P8: okay, you say, ever you say? Ever? Yes, ever. Yes. Okay. And how'd you go about doing that? I was at the Va. Hospital trying to get a veterans get the Va id card. and while I was there we were actually going through my information, which was good at the time, because that's when I discovered they had my address wrong. My address and phone of my contact. Information was incorrect in the system. It was tied to a different veteran. So that's how I did it. I actually did it in person at the hospital trying to get the veterans card.

22
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.210
Perigean: Okay, gotcha so imagine that the Va notified you that you needed to update your financial information in order to maintain your copay and your healthcare benefits. how do you think you'd go about doing that? I just recently changed my direct deposit through Va.

26
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.120
P8: so I actually went on to the VA benefits website. And there's a section there where you can check your payment history and stuff, and you can actually make changes there. So I did that last month, I do believe. Yeah, I did that in October. So I went to the website and made the like, the banking information change online.

29
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.670
Perigean: Okay, on va.gov. okay? So you imagine that you'd update your financial information on va.gov, probably correct. Correct. Okay, what would your preferred method of notification be if you needed to update your health care information. How would you like to be notified by the Va that you need to do that?

35
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.790
P8: Probably text or email.

36
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.700
Perigean:  And then how would you expect like, what steps do you think you'd have to take in order to update your information online?

38
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.000
P8: Just logging in and hopefully. when they text or or email me is they put like some sort of link in there that will? Well, I would say that would take me directly to it, but because of the way we have to log in I know it won't be direct. But at least when they email me, they tell me where I need to go. Once I do actually log on. So I'm not like going through the site trying to figure out where I need to go to update this information. So if an email give me some instructions on where I need to go once, I'm finally logged in.

42
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.810
Perigean: Okay. Gotcha. you would expect that that email, even if you had to go through all the process to sign in first. Then when you click the link in the email, it should take you somewhere where you can do that directly. Correct.

44
00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.910
P8: No, when I first said it, that's what I was thinking. But then I remembered how we have to actually log into VA. Gov, so I don't think that is like really feasible. But at least in the email, have some instructions on once you log in. go to whatever this tab is

49
00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:15.040
Perigean: and update your information there. I don't have to scroll all through the page trying to figure out where

50
00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:18.530
P8: I'm supposed to go. Just tell me where I'm supposed to go.

51
00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:19.700
Perigean: Gotcha. Thank you for clarifying, so your expectation is that there wouldn't really be a direct link in the email. But there would at least be instructions.

53
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.020
P8: Correct.

54
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:30.010
Perigean: Okay. great. Thank you for describing that. Alright. So for this next task, you'll be interacting with a beta version of the website. This has not been released yet, and it may not function exactly the way you expect. It will be linked to the Va system. So once we log in to the website, we will see some of your real information. So when we get to that part of the session. I will remind you not to actually submit the form that we'll be going through at the end. If you did, it could actually go to the Va. System. So I'll make sure that once we get there you don't submit anything. So for this next scenario. Let's imagine that you just started a new job. And your health insurance has changed because of that. You've realized that you need to update your insurance details for your Va healthcare benefits. To do that, you decided to search on Google to find out how to do that with the Va. And Google takes you to this page that I'm gonna send you a link to on Va Gov so would you be comfortable sharing your screen. Once we get you to that link.

63
00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:52.040
P8: Yes.

64
00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:59.049
Perigean: okay. So I'm gonna put the link in the zoom chat. Let me know if you need any help finding that and then when you find it I'm gonna ask you to share your screen, please be sure to close any personal information like email or Facebook. before sharing your screen.

66
00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.550
P8: And yes. share screen.

68
00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:29.330
Okay.

69
00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:38.600
P8: it's chair cheese is thinking.

72
00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.349
Perigean: yeah, it's thinking. yeah, I'll just take a sec. But can you see the screen that says how to update your Va health benefits information?

75
00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:18.250
P8: No, it's just as my share screen is loading. Now, says I am so green sharing.

76
00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.520
Perigean: Yeah, I'm starting to see something

77
00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:22.650
P8: here. I clicked on the link in the chat. It didn't. Okay. He's still thinking.

79
00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:32.070
Perigean: okay, no problem.

80
00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:04.370
P8: I just really see a white screen. Do you see the white screen? Okay, it's coming up now, I see. So staging. Va, Gov. okay, it's loading now. Okay.

83
00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:16.870
Perigean: I see it's thinking.

84
00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:17.940
P8: yes.

85
00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:20.539
Perigean: are you using chrome or edge?

86
00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:22.840
P8: Oh, chrome. Okay.

87
00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:24.690
Perigean: Gotcha.

88
00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:33.129
P8: I was actually bringing it up in in edge. Okay? Oh, you're an edge right now.

91
00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:53.509
Perigean: Okay, I think we're good now. Alright. So I'm gonna ask you to read through this page. Just take a little bit of time to review it and explain to me what the content on the page means to you, and what you would naturally do next if you had got a new job. You've got new health insurance. what would you do if you came to this page from Google?

94
00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.150
P8: So you saying this, okay, so you say, this is in addition to my Va healthcare, this new insurance. It's like.

97
00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.900
Perigean: yeah. So in the example.

98
00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:45.399
P8: okay, you started a new job. Now, you have new health insurance in addition to your Va. Health insurance. How do I let the Va. Know? Know I have. I have additional health insurance that I want to add. find out after we are enrolled. how do I update my information? So online in mail on the phone, I can do that. So if I want to do it. Online option, one on phone option, 2. That mail option, 3 in person. I don't wanna do that. See what information cannot update marital status, dependent status income deductible. How can I use this form? Can I use this for? And I use this form to fly? What does this Form X by my other insurance. What if I need help updating my information? Okay, now, I need you to refresh my memory. What was the question I was supposed to be responding to.

113
00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:21.090
Perigean:  what would you do first?

114
00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:23.350
P8: So I got some options. Here. Am I calling the Va. This option to by phone. Am I calling directly to the Va.

116
00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:34.470
Perigean: Is that what you think it's telling you?

117
00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:41.490
P8: Well, I'm asking cause depending upon how long I wanna be on the phone. If it's going to be quick, this Health Eligibility Center, I might just call the center and get them that information. But if I'm thinking I might be on the phone for a little while. Then I'm just gonna log in and do it. cause I think I could do it a lot quicker.

121
00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:05.340
Perigean: Okay. so what do you think you'd do?

122
00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:13.650
P8: Depend upon what time of day it is. So it's 1120, 1116. Right now, I would go online. Okay, do it. Cause if I was calling the Va. I need to call them early in the morning.

124
00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:27.920
Perigean: Okay, Gotcha. Well, all of that is helpful for us to know. That's why I asked and didn't answer your question right away. okay. So you'd want to do this the fastest way possible this time of day, probably be online. Did you have any questions about the information that you read through on this page? And what does the content on this page mean to you?

128
00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:52.119
P8: I don't have any questions, but it really is just telling me that everything that I if I needed to update is available to be updated from this page. Once I get started. if there are any changes in my life. I can just come straight here. and if it's anything that's applicable, then I can just go through the site and actually do it. And it's it's interesting. The what does this form. Ask about my other insurance. It's interesting and the will. My benefits change. is also interesting. I hadn't thought about that.

135
00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:38.319
Perigean: Okay, why is it interesting

136
00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:47.819
P8: because I hadn't thought about that where it says you can update your financial information and it'll help you determine if you need to pay a copay for a non-service connected care or prescription medications. And II guess, just because I use Va all the time for my healthcare and there's no such thing as a co-pay. If you know I don't pay for prescription. So to know that a change in your lifestyle cannot impact the change in your healthcare was just kind of interesting to see that.

142
00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:18.099
Perigean: Okay, that's new information to you.

143
00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:26.930
P8: Yeah, okay. well, it's new to me, because I've been  fully covered. But for I guess, for a person that has not been fully covered through via that might not be new information to them. But it's it's just new to me because I'm like, I said, I'm 100

147
00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:42.060
Perigean: gotcha.

148
00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:55.549
Perigean: Okay? On a scale of one to 5. How prepared does this page make you feel about the form that you're about to begin, one being very poorly prepared and 5 being very well prepared.

149
00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:06.369
P8: Okay, let me go back. And we cause. Now you're saying, I'm just updating my health insurance information. And so what? Which? One is fully prepared? 5. Okay, so right now, I'll say a 5. But I'll see what I hit the 4. But right now I think I'm fully prepared.

153
00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:26.370
Perigean: Okay, gotcha. do you have any suggestions or feedback about this page before we move on.

155
00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:32.400
P8: No, I don't.

156
00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:33.860
Perigean: Alright. Okay. So we are gonna next, open a new tab and sign into Va, gov, how? You typically would.

158
00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:49.589
P8: Okay, so you want me to open a new tab. Yeah. Now, I got to do the Googles.

160
00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:56.620
Perigean: and it's totally okay. Take your time. Once you are logged in. I know that will probably take a little bit. Then I'm gonna send you a link in the chat again to go to.

162
00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:09.770
P8: Okay. But that's after I sign in. Okay. hold on 1 s. I'm sorry.

164
00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:57.020
Perigean: That's okay. Take your time.

165
00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:11.630
P8: Yeah. Just give me a minute, because that do not recall. I don't know my username password off the top of my head. So yeah, that's what I'm doing. this one right here. I was just waiting for it to send me a SMS text.

170
00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:36.070
Perigean: Okay, hasn't come through yet.

171
00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:37.780
P8: Nope. okay. let's see what this is.

174
00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:19.169
Perigean: Okay. Awesome. You're signed in. Now, I'm going to put the link in the zoom chat again. And you're gonna wanna click on that link. and then we'll see hopefully. That will take you to the right page.

177
00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:38.769
P8: Let's see, I wanna make sure I have the right one. Okay, so this is 1124.

178
00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:40.360
Perigean: Yeah. perfect scroll down a little bit. Just so I can double check that. Everything's correct. Okay, yeah, we're good.

182
00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:54.549
P8: Alright, thank you so much.

183
00:20:54.910 --> 00:21:05.860
Perigean:  so for this next text, we're gonna go through this form as if you were prompted to update your information from the Va. and this is just a special data version of the form we activated it for the email that you provided to perigee. And so it has not been officially released yet. We wanna be really careful not to submit the form at the end. When there's a review page. And I'll remind you when we get there.

185
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:27.010
P8: Okay.

186
00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:45.780
Perigean: as you're going through the form you can pretty much use your real information, you know, because we want to see what's stumbling blocks and things you might come across. But if you're not comfortable entering things like income, and whatnot. You can make that up. That's totally fine. And please talk aloud as you go as much as possible. So please take a look at this page. Here, let me know what the content means to you. And what you would do next.

188
00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:12.690
P8: Okay, update your Va health benefit information. Let me see. So I'm looking to either update my personal, financial or insurance information. Since I am already enrolled in va healthcare. Let's see what to know before I fill out this form. So it's just telling me what I can update my marital status, dependent information and income from 2022. Okay. I don't really understand what they'd say. My spouse's deductible expenses. So hopefully, you know. they'll tell me what that means. okay. Okay. Then it goes back to tell me if I'm gonna need, it'll tell me if I need to do. Just talking about the Copay stuff again. Let's see, I can update my personal information and my assurance information. Let's see. they'll prefill in part of the information based upon my bank account information. and let's see. So I don't have to do the form all in one sitting, because they said, they'll I can save my progress, and then I can come back and fill it out. and then it tells me that I can start my health benefits form by clicking on the green button the Green arrow button.

201
00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:41.070
Perigean: Okay.

202
00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:43.250
P8: so what do you want me to do now?

203
00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:50.390
Perigean:  is that what you would do next? Yeah. Okay. Let's pause for a sec. If you had to rate this page on a scale of one to 5 one being very poorly prepared, and 5 being very well prepared. How prepared do you feel to fill out the form after looking through it

207
00:24:07.330 --> 00:24:08.290
P8: by

208
00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:11.109
Perigean: okay. And why would you give it that rating?

209
00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:20.130
P8: Because all the information. If I'm doing insurance information, all the prerequisites for what I need to do are provided on this page. So I should just be able just click on it. Once I gathered all of my information, I should just be able to click on it and then input, my information.

212
00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:43.319
Perigean: Okay, so do you think at this point you would start it, or would you? Would there be things you'd want to go gather first?

213
00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:49.740
P8: I'm just sticking with the insurance stuff. I would probably have all that information already. So I would just click on the next thing.

217
00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:57.700
Perigean: Okay. let's go ahead and click the start. Your health benefits update form alright. So take a look at this page. Tell me what what you think it's telling you.

220
00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:34.939
P8: Okay, so it's it's pre-filled. I guess the form like it indicated earlier. Let me see, they've indicated that they'll save the changes everywhere I go, so that hopes with. I don't have to do it all in one setting, or I don't have to. If I go away, then I don't have to fill out the information again, because it's saved. And so here's my my personal, identify my pii information. So my social, my date of birth, my gender. And I would just review this and make sure my last 4. My name is correct. My last 4 is correct. My birth date is correct, my gender is correct, and then I would just continue on.

226
00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:14.890
Perigean: Okay. you can go ahead and click. Continue. Then

227
00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:26.210
P8: let's see. Okay. So they said, they pre-fill some of the information into my account and ask me to correct anything that needs to be corrected. So my mail and address. So I would just review that. yeah. So is reviewed. And I would just hit. Continue.

231
00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:46.659
Perigean: Okay. And how do you feel about some of this information being pre filled?

232
00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:49.550
P8: I love it.

233
00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:55.689
Perigean: No, I said, I love it.

234
00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:58.200
P8: So why do you love it. cause I don't have to do it. It's already there. And then it tells me that they actually have my correct information on file. Okay? All right? Well, you can continue if that's what you do next. Okay, so here I am verifying my phone and email address. I didn't know it's optional. But okay, it's optional.

239
00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:29.370
Perigean: How do you know it's optional?

240
00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:34.249
P8: Cause it says, adding your email and phone number is optional. Yeah, I didn't realize that.  I would put it in there because I need Va. To be able to contact me as many ways as possible. So it helps. That is there. The only thing, I would add, is my mobile number is not here. not pre-filled here. but I know they have my mobile number on file, because I get text messages from. So I would just put in my phone number my mobile phone number. And then I will hit. Continue.

245
00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:09.630
Perigean: Okay, you can go ahead and do that you can put a fake one. It doesn't matter.

246
00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:26.050
P8: not at. You have to be thanking. and so I see on the bottom it says your form has been saved.  with the date, and the time is some sort of form id number. And I would hit continue.

247
00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:28.859
Perigean: Okay. you can go ahead and do that.

248
00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:41.689
P8: Okay again. So now my household information is here. So I guess it's my marital status. I would just verify this and just hit continue.

249
00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:42.940
Perigean: Okay. you can do that.

251
00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:49.810
P8: Okay. a. So let me put my. I would complete this form. This is information.

255
00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:18.529
Perigean: what's that?

256
00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:23.929
P8: Oh, well, then, I gotta go back and do his. I was just making up numbers.

259
00:29:31.810 --> 00:29:46.700
Perigean: but I think you can make up a number. It just has to be kind of random.

260
00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:50.690
P8: This is interesting. Oh, so

262
00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:55.470
Perigean: why is it interesting?

263
00:29:56.410 --> 00:29:57.690
P8: Oh. well, it's only interesting, cause. I don't know why they care. But but when we got married?  But they do. So. Okay.

266
00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:16.879
Perigean: do you have any like hesitancy to provide that information, or just curious why they need it.

267
00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:22.470
P8: Just curious why they needed because Number one, I thought they had it already. But and maybe just because we've been married for 30 some odd years. So I'm sure at some point in time. I filled it out on a form. So I just thought they had that all this information already.

269
00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:40.050
P8: So just curious. Why, they would need it for me just to provide an update so that they didn't have. It is curious to me. okay, so I would fill this out. Wonder why they needed it, like I just did, but I would still fill it out and just hit. Continue.

273
00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:01.290
Perigean: we can hit continue.

274
00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:04.750
P8: Let's see. So did my spouse live with me? Do we live at the same address? So I would do what I just did fill the form out, and I would hit continue. I have no questions about this part. I would annotate if they're talking about dependents. Let's see. who do we consider to be a dependent, a spouse. Oh. so I guess my spouse is a dependent alright. Let me read that again. Who hears who we consider to be a dependent, a spouse. Okay, dokey.

282
00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:01.230
Perigean: That's surprising to you.

283
00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:09.400
P8: Yeah. only because anytime I think about that is just in just on the tax forms. So that is here. But I guess, like, I said. is for household financial information. I guess they're using it to make some sort of determination. So I would annotate my husband is a spouse, and then I would he continue so? Now that's interesting. Because now this asking me for dependent information. so is it asking me to once again put all of his information in.

288
00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:50.239
Perigean: Is that what you think it's asking?

289
00:32:51.120 --> 00:33:00.640
P8:  yeah. But then my question would be like, why do I need it again? Why do I need to do it again? You asked me if I had a spouse? I told you I did. Then you ask me. was my spouse, my dependent. and you said a spouse is a dependent. And now I had to fill out all this information again on the dependent form. Why would it just not carry over Once I once I annotated that I had a spouse, and my spouse is my dependent.

293
00:33:25.390 --> 00:33:27.080
Perigean: Okay, Gotcha.

294
00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:32.220
P8: So instead of making me fill out this same information again. Yeah, or my spouse, who I already told you I had and was my dependent. If it was my child, I could understand that because you didn't ask me for my child's information. 2 screens back. You asked me for my spouse's information, and so now I have to do it again. So so I guess I'll do it again.

299
00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:58.259
Perigean: Yeah, let's enter it. But thank you. That's really helpful feedback.

300
00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:48.090
P8: And then I would hit. Continue.

301
00:34:48.130 --> 00:34:49.639
Perigean: Okay, go ahead.

302
00:34:50.730 --> 00:34:56.919
P8: And now let's see what this is. Say, still talking about my household financial information, 0 dependent. So now it's asking me questions about my spouse? Is he living with a permanent disability? No. Does he live with you? Is he again 2 screens back? You asked me about them. My spouse live with me in 2022, so I feel like I'm answering the same questions over and over again. God! I feel a little redundancy here, so I'd have been missed in that hint I would have wish I would call somebody on the phone. But okay, did your dependent live with you? Yes. Did he earn income. Okay? And 2022. And then I would hit continue. So now we're talking about his income. which all of this is kind of interesting, because all I really wanted to do was tell you about my new health insurance. I don't. I'm now. I'm kind of feeling like I don't know why I need to answer all of these additional questions. because II came over here to tell you about my health insurance. And now we're talking about
his income. So so I'm I'm a like, make up numbers. I don't know. That's totally fine. So so I'm just throwing numbers in

318
00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:42.280
Perigean: okay, anything confusing to you other than you know. You don't know why this is required, and are surprised that they're asking it to.

319
00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:44.320
P8: No. no, because this this is 2 years ago. So well, the only thing is be because I said, I know I'm coming to update my health information. I may not have had his income information when I started this because I would only have my health information stuff. I knew I needed that. So now that you're asking me about income, which. if I wanted to make adjustments to income I would have had that information. But I didn't. I didn't come over here for that. I came over here to just to tell you I got tricia prime, and it started this day, etc. Etc. So now I gotta go back and pull up some tax forms because we talk about annual income for 2022. And it's November 2023. I ain't gonna remember all that. So that's the only thing that is would have me just a little myth is now I got to stop doing what I'm doing. what something I thought was, gonna take me like 5 min to do is now going on. I started this at like 1116 is not going on 20 min. Yeah, so that would that would be it. But so II run and grab all my information, or I so well, let me ask you this because I would have had to stop doing what I'm doing. Say, I wanted to come back to this later. How do I know that this has saved? If I don't, he'd continue. because I think if I hit continue. It is a deform and say. Yeah, but don't get continued. But I just wanna log out. So would I need to just put what I thought in here, and then hit, continue. and then let it save, and then come back to this. Once I get my information, and then do I have the ability to go back. Does it start me back at the beginning, or does it start me at the pace that I left off on

335
00:38:44.090 --> 00:38:50.199
Perigean: so about your expectations, about all that. How would you? How do you think you'd come back to this form? And do you think it would have saved the information from this page, I think was what you were asking.

337
00:38:56.280 --> 00:39:02.869
P8: Yeah. So right now, I think I would have to continue, which I'm gonna do, just because I want to see for myself, so I can continue. and I don't. I didn't. Okay, it did say it save Saddam will go and hit back and see what happens. So okay, so I wouldn't. I hit back and it took me back to spouses information. It didn't take me back to the last form I was on. Okay. So it took me back to step 2. So now I'm gonna hit. where it says, review my dependence. So it says, review my dependence. So Namma hit edit to see what happened.

343
00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:36.070
Perigean: Okay?

344
00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:38.920
P8: And so that information is saved. Now I'm gonna hit continue again. and that hmm, and that is the. And so, okay, so I see it does not take me back to the last screen I was on.

349
00:39:59.190 --> 00:40:01.229
Perigean: and that you would expect.

350
00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:07.720
P8: Yeah, that's what I would expect is, you took me back to the last screen I was I was on, but I see that it didn't do that, but now I see where I would have to go back to in order to. and once I grabbed all my other documents put how I get back to where I left off of

354
00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:26.970
Perigean: okay.

355
00:40:27.370 --> 00:40:32.719
P8: So now it's asking me, do I have another dependent to report? I will hit. No. and hit continue. And I guess the screen just saved. So now I have to put in my growth my income. I'm just putting in numbers. I don't know.

359
00:40:46.830 --> 00:40:47.969
Perigean: Okay, that's

360
00:40:48.250 --> 00:40:54.549
P8: cause. Again. I would not have had this information when I got started, but since I had to go grab his, I grab mine. Putting in my information. I'm gonna hit. Continue. Now, I'm confused. Cause why is does it? Why is it asking me? My spouse's annual income? Okay? So. Now I'm confused, he, because my spouse is my dependent. So right now. I think I'm doing a lot of extra work. Okay, I would. I don't like this at all, though. So in that question, when they ask about dependence. they don't seem to be differentiating between a dependent and a spouse. or or saying that your dependent is your spouse. So your information just automatically carries over, is making it seem like you're dependent. and your spouse are not the same person. So you're asking me for a lot of information that in my mind is redundant because they are one and the same. If I had children I could understand, or if I had a parent that was my dependent, somebody other than my spouse. But so again, I would have to put this down and try to figure out, what are these medical expenses? Because I didn't come over here for all of this.

378
00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:24.580
Perigean: Don't be upset personally right by now. But okay.

379
00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:34.720
P8: why? Because you asked me to update my health insurance information. that's all I came over here to do is update. Try care. Starting to say, blah, blah, blah! That's all you guys need to do. But all this stuff about vocational expenses. funeral burial expenses. So maybe I misunderstood in this. Email what you were asking me to do. because this is I'm just putting 0 in here because I don't know.

382
00:42:55.870 --> 00:43:02.550
Perigean:  yeah, I'm curious about that, you know medical expense question. Do you know what that means? And would you be able to gather that information? I do not, but I will know, because it said what we consider nonreimbursable medical expenses.

385
00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:15.330
P8: So now that I'm here, I can hit the dropdown like I just did and be like, oh, this is the kind of stuff I mean I need. But again, when I started this. I didn't know I needed all of this. Give me homework. So now I have to go. Stop again. Go find these things that you all, considering non reimbursable medical expenses. If I have any. and and and put this information in So you're pretty sure you'd have to save this form and come back. Have to save this form and and go do homework cause. Now we're talking about 2,022. And again, is November 2023. Yeah. So you know. if I didn't keep any of these documents, and you know, if I didn't deduct any of my taxes. I got homework, and I'm not happy. But and I'm not happy because I still haven't seen the the form, the portion of the form where I'm just updating my health insurance information.

395
00:44:32.610 --> 00:44:34.480
Perigean: Umhm, okay.

396
00:44:37.890 --> 00:44:46.269
P8: so I honestly think now that I'm looking at this, that I would if there's the the Pdf version of the form that I would a downloaded the PDF. Version of the form first, so I could see every question just laid out in front of me. and then that would have allowed me to go and gather all the information that I needed. So when I got ready to go online. I could just go online. I have all my information I've done on my homework. Now, I could just go online and complete the form online, because, like, I said, what I thought was, 5 min is is not 5 min. So II would not be like. especially if I was just trying to do it on my lunch work or something like this, I would, I would really not be happy with this right now.

403
00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:47.339
Perigean: Okay, yeah, that's really helpful. So you said at the Intro page you felt really prepared now that you're seeing the actual questions which you didn't have an opportunity to see in the beginning you're not feeling prepared. Is that correct?

404
00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:54.630
P8: So now I've done this done my homework. And he continued. and step 3, so I would have just wanted it to give me a option to be like. I came to update my insurance information click on here to get to insurance information, updated my insurance information. and then. you know, I can understand. If it was saying, Hey, just look over these things and make sure this. All this other information is correct. But like, I said, I literally just came over here to do step 3, update my insurance information and then just go away. But so okay. So I said, pre-fill, I'm too young for Medicaid. So okay, oh, Medicare, or whatever that is. Okay. Oh, that's Medicaid. Let me. So I would read this, since this is Medicaid, I'm not eligible for Medicaid, and then I will hit. Continue. now. So now we're asking about Medicare. So I would read this. and it's pre-filled. So okay. I'm still reading. Health insurance includes the coverage. A. Why giving us this information, we ask that you provide information health insurance. Okay. I don't understand what what the question is here. It says Hoff insurers includes any coverage that you get through a spouse or significant other. It includes insurance. Blah blah blah. We ask for this information. Okay, do you have? How. I would think, do you have health insurance coverage to add, should be the first sentence.

424
00:47:48.310 --> 00:47:51.119
Perigean: not the last sentence.

425
00:47:51.300 --> 00:48:04.569
P8: Okay? Cause I was just kind of glancing through. So I missed the question altogether, even though it has a big required red sitting right next to it. But I would make that the first question, the first sentence, not the very last one. Okay. And so this is what I came over here to do. So I'm a hit. Continue. blah blah blah. Okay. So let's see. Provide either your policy number.

433
00:48:37.870 --> 00:48:40.879
Perigean: Do you think you'll be able to find that easily.

434
00:48:42.210 --> 00:48:53.709
P8:  yeah, that's on my id card. Okay? So on the back, I think it's on the back of it. The back of the Id card is like your benefits. Number ---, you have a tricare. yeah.

437
00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:00.240
Perigean: okay.

438
00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:04.640
P8: so so my family is enrolled in tricare. But I get my healthcare through. VA. Okay. So I would put my benefits. Number. That's on the back of my Id card in. There is the policy number is, if there's another one, I don't know what it is, because I just hand them my id card, and they just. and he just hands them his id card, and they just run with that. So I would just put in the number that's on the back of my Id card I would put. Here is the policy number. And then I would just hit continue because it says policy number or or group code, and I don't know what that is. So I would just run with the policy number, and then I would hit continue.

446
00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:55.179
Perigean: Okay, you can do that.

447
00:49:56.220 --> 00:50:02.649
P8: And what does it say now? So now we still on insurance information. and let me do have more health insurance coverage. To add again, I will make that the first sentence cause. I don't really care about all that stuff in the middle. I read it on the previous page.  And then I would hit. No. and I would hit continue because I saw it save.

451
00:50:24.780 --> 00:50:32.179
Perigean: Okay, so this is the last page of the form, I believe. Let's make sure that we don't submit the form. But you can keep reviewing.

452
00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:34.059
P8: Okay? So I would. Now, I do believe I would hit the dropdown just so I can review everything. So I'm hitting dropdowns, just so I can review everything. And so once I hit the dropdowns and everything looked good. I would read the agreement. I'm gonna be honest with you. I probably wouldn't read the the the privacy policy unless it force me, because, you know, some things will force you to read them, at least click on them before. It will allow you to submit. But I would read everything. I just wouldn't hit the hyperlink. and then I would hit, confirm, and then I would hit submit.

460
00:51:28.250 --> 00:51:36.660
Perigean: Okay, Gotcha. Alright, you don't have to actually do that. Yeah, I'm not. Yes, so what we're actually gonna do next is we want to clear all the information we just entered. Most of it's fake.

462
00:51:44.260 --> 00:51:51.340
P8: So let's click the finish this form later. Link Umhm, okay, finish this form later.

463
00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:55.140
Perigean: and then click, start a new form.

464
00:51:56.340 --> 00:52:07.200
P8: start in new form, start in the new form, will delete your in progress form. Are you sure you want to start over. Yes, right you are requested to fill this out later. You'll be notified of that. And you'll want to put in real information. We're we're good. We are all done with the form. You can stop sharing if you're able to. Okay, so do I. Just do you want me to just log off of this. Now.

467
00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:36.720
Perigean: yeah, you can. I just have like a last question for you before we sign off. But we're all set with the website.

468
00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:43.470
P8: Okay? And so now, we can stop sharing the pay. Both stop sharing. Okay.

469
00:52:43.570 --> 00:52:56.710
Perigean: thank you so much. This is really helpful. All of your feedback will help us make the form better before it's launched. So we really appreciate that is there anything else that you would like to add that we talked about today, or any questions that you have for me.

470
00:52:57.550 --> 00:53:03.679
P8: The only thing is just so I have a a better understanding. Or, yeah. So I have a better answer. If they are asking me, cause you're saying they reach. Va. Reached out to me. Oh, no, you didn't. You just said I got a new job, and I needed to update this information. Okay. hypothetical, you know. Then, no, not just. I understand that I have to do the entire form, not just the one little piece in my mind that I was thinking that I had to do.

476
00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:48.579
Perigean: Yeah, I totally get how you know you would be confused about that. And that's good for us to know. For people who, you know do get a new job and just want to update something that they would be like, why are they asking all this stuff. you know, when II just came here to update my my insurance information?

478
00:53:53.170 --> 00:53:53.870
Thank you.

479
00:53:54.590 --> 00:53:56.100
Perigean: That's helpful for us.

480
00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:57.420
P8: Okay.

481
00:53:58.660 --> 00:54:21.039
Perigean: alright. So before we end the session, I just wanna circle back and reconfirm. Are you comfortable? If we were to share a video clip of the session with our Va partners. Remove any identifying information. And we would only share that with our Va partners with the purpose of improving Vaidgov and other Va digital experiences. Is that okay with you?

482
00:54:21.540 --> 00:54:22.450
P8: Yes.

483
00:54:22.830 --> 00:54:27.400
Perigean: Okay. Is there any part of our discussion that you would not want shared in a video clip?

484
00:54:27.660 --> 00:54:28.580
P8: None.

485
00:54:29.070 --> 00:54:31.470
Perigean: Alright. Great. No other questions for me.

487
00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:35.050
P8: no.

488
00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:45.460
