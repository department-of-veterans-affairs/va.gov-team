00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:10.129
Hieu (Moderator): So I've started recording. I like to confirm that you are comfortable. If I record my screen and the audio as we talk today.

2
00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:11.489
P7: Federal budget.

3
00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:19.360
Hieu (Moderator): Okay? And then, are you comfortable? We decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with our Va partners. Okay, thank you for that, and then can finally jump on to the study. We'll warm up with a few questions here. Do you have service connected disability at the VA. Okay. And then, when was the last time you visited A. VA medical facility

7
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.660
P7: in April

8
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.159
Hieu (Moderator): in April, did you say? April?

9
00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.289
P7: Yes, I did.

10
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.139
Hieu (Moderator): Okay, so that's quite a while ago. Can you share any past experience regarding updates to your healthcare benefit information?

12
00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:06.929
P7:  no, I have not had any interaction on benefit information.

13
00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:13.070
Hieu (Moderator): So you haven't had to move. Update your address or dependent information.

14
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.250
P7: Oh, cool. Yeah. Okay, good, prompt. one reason that my last interaction with the sorry. Let me rewind. My last interaction with the Va. Was not in April. That was my last interaction. At May third Va. I went to New England in April.

19
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.140
and

20
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.879
P7: I had at that time a diagnosis and a of skin cancer melanoma which needed to be removed. and I had an appointment.  which then I needed to move to New England, because that's where I was going to be for 6 months. So my last interactions were actually in July, as I was prepping to get that surgery there which actually turned out to be a bit of an odd thing, because there's not much interaction between the Va. Organization on the West Coast where I live. Most of the year. and New England. where I needed the surgery. A. I wasn't able to figure out how to transfer services over to New England to where I could get that surgery. So I went to a local Cboc and they they told me that. Oh, there's a guy you can talk to who's in charge of traveling veterans. So once I connected with that guy. he was able to get me properly connected up with the Va. Organization so that I could schedule the surgery in New England, and it all worked out fine. Okay? So up to then it was little bit difficult between the communications on both sides. The 2 Va organizations don't seem to communicate. I understand that there are different districts or regions, and they each have their own systems. So

37
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:50.960
Hieu (Moderator): and then in this process, did you have to kind of update your address at all. Or it's just a special traveling case.

38
00:03:53.070 --> 00:04:03.959
P7: Yeah, good question. I think I just communicated with the traveling Vet advisor over the phone rather than updating my address online.

40
00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.790
Hieu (Moderator): I gotcha. So it was just strictly through that kind of portal that you're you're giving your information.

42
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.420
P7: Yeah.

43
00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:19.700
Hieu (Moderator): okay, that makes sense. Wow, that's wild that you have to go across the country to do this.

45
00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:40.319
P7: Well, II didn't have to go across the country get the surgery. I was already scheduled to go across the country and spend time there. It was just that my schedule was such that I couldn't get the surgery on the West coast, because I was going to the east coast.

46
00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:49.460
Hieu (Moderator): and then, like for the next one, can you imagine you have been notified to kind of update your financial information. to basically maintain your copay or health care benefit. How might you go about doing that?

48
00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.290
P7: How would you see online portals?

49
00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.249
Hieu (Moderator): Okay? So you're pretty comfortable with that online portal?

50
00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:04.710
P7: Gotcha.

51
00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:12.440
Hieu (Moderator): can you kind of describe the specific steps like, Are you gonna sign into Va Gov. Or what's your typical approach?

52
00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:21.620
P7: I will look in my password manager and tell you which of those various addresses I use. I use id dot me to login.

54
00:05:50.990 --> 00:06:01.190
Hieu (Moderator): Okay? So it sounds like you use the VA. Gov. and then you would use that portal to kind of update any information you need. Does that sound correct?

55
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:08.010
P7: Really, I log directly into api.id dot me. because I've been multiple times. I've 1 one moment.

59
00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:34.049
Hieu (Moderator): okay, yeah, I've got another one from va.com. So yeah, that's good, too. And then, can you please describe your preferred method of notification for these types of updates like, you move your insurance change, etcetera, like, how would you want to be notified to update that information?

61
00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:42.750
P7: Email? Email? You said, Okay.

63
00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:59.640
Hieu (Moderator): and then for the next test, you'll be interacting with a beta version of the web of the website today. The tool has not been released. So it may not function exactly the way you expect it to. since it is linked to the Va system, it will show you your real information towards the end. I'll remind you not to submit anything because it is connected to the Va. System. For the next scenario, I imagine you just started a new job job and your healthcare insurance has changed because of it. Now you realize that you need to update your insurance detail for the Va healthcare benefit. Do that you got on Google, and just see where you can update that information. And Google takes you to this page on Va, where you're about to see for the scenario. Are you comfortable with sharing your screen and walking through your process? Okay, please be sure to close any personal information like your email and your Facebook. Then I'll paste a link in the chat for you to click on.

70
00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:07.240
P7: Hey? Got it?

71
00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.859
Hieu (Moderator): Okay? And then can you share your screen.

72
00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:11.880
P7: No.

73
00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:16.410
Hieu (Moderator): that let me know if you need any assistant. With that

74
00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:28.470
P7: I see it right on. Okay.

75
00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:39.589
Hieu (Moderator): So you have arrived on this page. Please take a few minutes to review this page and explain the content on this page and what it means to you and what you would naturally do.

76
00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:17.760
P7: Okay, I found that I can update insurance information. Since that's the scenario and that I can do this online using this option one.

79
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:40.930
Hieu (Moderator): And then your naturally for you, if you were to update for real, would you just sign in right there, or you would you continue reading some more?

81
00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:44.379
P7: I would sign in right there.

82
00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:50.720
Hieu (Moderator): Okay, do you have any question any question about the information listed so far?

83
00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.210
P7: Not yet.

84
00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:53.540
Hieu (Moderator): Okay.

85
00:09:53.780 --> 00:10:08.839
P7: And then I do have a question. Yeah, go ahead.  We have options to login with login, gov ids, login, or my health feedback accounts. I think I have ended up in all of one time or another. I just find it a confusing that there are 4 different ways to log in. So that's something I finally just settled on one, and I use it. Me I was. I was Conf, I've went gone through multiple iterations before saying, Okay, I give up on the other way. I'll just stop using my healthy vet, and I'll just use it. So Was there a reason why you jump from one login style to the other. This is a while ago, but I think I was originally using my and then it was recommended to use one of the others, I think, does that sound right?

95
00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:08.630
Hieu (Moderator): okay.

96
00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:12.629
P7: yeah, II think it may have been a recommendation on the website. So that's all right. I got ya.

98
00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:20.870
Hieu (Moderator): And then do you want to basically consolidate? So there's only one simple login for everyone?

99
00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:23.410
P7: Yeah, I mean. yes, II think that people would appreciate a clear. single path to log in. I get that id dot. Me can be used for multiple purposes. but I think veterans would prefer to have one layer simple way to log in.

105
00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.269
Hieu (Moderator): Thank you for that feedback. And then so not quite yet. I got a couple more questions for this page here? So I have you finished? Gone through this whole page in terms of your how you would normally review it. Okay, on a scale of one to 5, one being very poor and 5 being very well. How prepared does this page make you feel about the form you're about to begin.

110
00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:24.370
P7: Good. 5.

111
00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:28.839
Hieu (Moderator): Okay. Is it? Just because it's straightforward and clear?

112
00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:37.840
P7: Right? I would. Other things being equal, I would prefer to do this online. The instructions for that are clear how to proceed. I scroll down, and I found that that's where I can put insurance information. So I'm good to go. It's all clear and simple, and I'm ready. Sounds great. Do you have any kind of suggestions or feedback for making this page better. Oh, not this one.

116
00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:13.250
Hieu (Moderator): Okay, great. So what you're looking at right now is basically a mockup of the website. So it's actually not like connected to the Va. System at all. Now for the next part, we will be moving to the actual website. So if you can open up a new window and log into your va account as you as you would normally do it.

118
00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:51.710
P7:  I don't. This note that I have to myself reminds me that part of a time depending on which VA. Functions I'm trying to do. Sometimes it wasn't working with Fire Fox. So I was using edge.

123
00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:16.930
Hieu (Moderator): I see.

124
00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:19.460
P7: instead of that. So I'm just gonna go ahead and it. So here's anyway so you're just asking me to pick my own way to login. Right? So many options.

129
00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:08.709
Hieu (Moderator): Hopefully, it'll be simpler in the future.

130
00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:10.360
P7: Good. I use multiple different ways. So this could be set to. For example, other things being equal, I prefer to use a Co. Generator, but I don't remember now whether that was set up in advance, so some applications will say you. You've in the past. You've used a security key or a co-generator.  so that you know that that's a way that you've done it in the past. and in this case I don't even think I have the ie. Dot me authenticator on hand. and I don't know I have a security key, but I don't know whether I've used it in the past to log into the Va. So it's it would. It could be clearer by looking at the profile of the person. And anyway, so I'm gonna go with a text message, yeah.

143
00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:42.350
Hieu (Moderator): thank you for that feedback.

144
00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:45.930
P7: So text me, that number's okay.

145
00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:38.490
Hieu (Moderator): Okay, and you're in. Now, I will give you a second link. And hopefully, because you are signed in. you should be able to access this this page.

147
00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:50.360
P7: Okay. So

148
00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:57.169
Hieu (Moderator): we've been struggling to get access on this page here. But hopefully, your luck is better.

149
00:17:57.550 --> 00:17:58.370
P7: Okay.

150
00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:08.230
Hieu (Moderator): you can see in the chat window. You can either copy and paste it into your Firefox or you can click on it. Wow, okay, you are in.

152
00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:32.680
P7: Okay.

153
00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:36.379
Hieu (Moderator): So this is the introduction part of the kind of update form that you're about to fill out. You arrived on this page. Please take a few minutes to review this page and explain what the content on this page means to you. And again, what would you naturally do?

155
00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:51.250
P7: Okay.

156
00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:24.500
Hieu (Moderator): can you summarize the most important information you found on this page to prepare you for the form.

157
00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:28.170
P7: Sure. The first thing is. I'm kind of anchoring myself mentally. because my goal is to update the insurance information. So I wanna know first that I'm on the right page. So I found that first. So now I'm looking okay. This is the right place. Now, where are the instructions about what to do. So that's where I am.

163
00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:05.790
Hieu (Moderator): Okay, sounds good. And then on a scale of one to 5, one being very poorly and 5 being very well. How prepared does this page make you feel about the form you're about to begin?

165
00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:39.350
P7:  say 4 and the only reason I wouldn't give it a 5 is that it provides the information about what to know before you fill out the form. Before you know you want to fill out the form here, so I would want to know. First. am I anchored in the right place? Is this the right form for me? And once I know that information. then I will want to know what to know before filling out the form. So now I do know that that's why I give it a 4, and I know that this is information that I need to have. And now I can start the form.

171
00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.300
Hieu (Moderator): I see. Thank you for that feedback, and then for our purposes, we will go through the the form as if you were prompted to update that information. I do. Wanna note, this is a special data version that's accessible through the email that that you were that you would provide before it's official release. So I do want to note that it is connected. That Va system. So all the information are accurate. So I would remind you towards the end, not to submit anything go ahead and kind of start your healthcare benefit. Update form right there. Yes. And then, as you go through the form, please kind of use real information to fill things out and then talk out loud as you're going through this

178
00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:06.190
P7: right? I am looking for a place to update my insurance information. Oh, I'm seeing that. Yes, this is me. It's got the right information about me. Play it. okay, so that's me. yeah, okay, good to go. Okay. So you would continue after reviewing that right? Okay. I've reviewed that.

187
00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:20.150
Hieu (Moderator): So I think you noticed that that information was pre-filled for you. What is your expectation. Regarding that prefill feature.

188
00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:25.840
P7: I like it. what? What sort of expectations are you thinking of?

189
00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:31.829
Hieu (Moderator): I was just curious. Your reaction. And that's that's really it.

190
00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:37.340
P7: Okay, yeah, II like that. It's prefilled. That's very helpful in You've already got the information. No need to type it in again. Great. Okay. Sounds good. We can move through the next one

194
00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:56.170
P7: oop. And okay. parental status is correct. Yep. the spouse's name is required.

199
00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:22.469
Hieu (Moderator): So please use real information as if you're actually filling up the form. But for social security, just make up a realistic living number.

201
00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:51.320
P7: Oops you're on. Yes, I lived with my spouse. Yes, we have the same address. 2 million phones. 2

207
00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:21.919
Hieu (Moderator): for this area. It sounded, or it looks like it takes you no time at all to fill out this information. Is it because you already have it steadily available?

208
00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:26.740
P7: My gross income I make. I completely made it up. So it was really quick.

209
00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:36.319
Hieu (Moderator): Okay, but if you are doing this for real would it take you a little bit of time to to make to find, or is it pretty quick as well?

210
00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:45.149
P7: Oh, well, I I guess I would go look in my income taxes and find that out.

212
00:26:48.090 --> 00:27:03.829
Hieu (Moderator):  so yeah, that would take me a few minutes. You want me to go off and do that. So no, II was just curious just in realistic case like, so that would take you some time. Would you? try to complete this form later, or would you try doing one sitting?

214
00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:12.730
P7: I try to do it in one sitting. I don't see any advantage in coming back later.

215
00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:23.399
Hieu (Moderator): Okay, right? That makes sense. It's great that you have 2 million dollars of income. That's fantastic. But yeah, please continue

217
00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:35.909
P7: okay. A from my farm property or business. I'll say that was 1 million of my 2 million. I like some financial advice from you, please. Sure. Oh, oh, you've got my email address. Other income doesn't come from a job. This is my passive income. So my passes and come out of that must have been out than the other 1 million. Cause. alright good to go bousers. Okay? So again, I would need to go look at the income tax return to find out what her actual income was. and we'll say that that was 1 million. and she didn't have any farmer business and no other.

236
00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:04.769
Hieu (Moderator): I'm glad you 2 are doing so. Well.

237
00:29:05.490 --> 00:29:06.170
P7: Okay. now. Deductible expenses. medical expenses unreversible. Well, in terms of the amount of time it would take to know this amount that would take some research. because I could have a deductibles and other kinds of information about non reimbursable expenses, or kind of randomly splattered around my records. So, anyway, this would take up quite a bit of time to find this

247
00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:27.150
Hieu (Moderator): gotcha good to know. Thank you for that.

248
00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:30.249
P7: This is gonna be a thousand dollars. No college or vocational funeral or burial not eligible for Medicaid have enrolled. hey? Enrolled in Medicare advantage, which is not exactly the same as Medicare a. But I'd assume that the intent of this question is that I am. I'm enrolled in Medicare, which covers part A, so something to consider might be that to mention the possibility of Medicare advantage. because, like half of the people doing Medicare actually enrolled in medicare advantage programs, not in actual medicare.

260
00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:52.660
Hieu (Moderator): It could clear up some confusion. It also introduced some new confusion. But

261
00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:54.220
P7: something to consider.

262
00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:56.530
Hieu (Moderator): Okay, thank you for that feedback.

263
00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:01.270
P7:  information. You have health insurance coverage to add. So in this scenario I'm changing. and so I'll say yes. But it might also be worthwhile to say, to change or add.

268
00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:31.700
Hieu (Moderator): hmm.

269
00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:41.729
P7: okay. So to enter all the required information name of the insurance provider. Okay, so this is my new employers. I will see number. Okay. it's not required. If you mentioned policy number continue. do your policies. It would be useful to have on that page all the information that I entered, including the policy number or the group. Otherwise I need to go edit it to find it.

278
00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:59.079
Hieu (Moderator): Hmm. So you want the all information shown

279
00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:01.810
P7: would just seem helpful. Yeah. okay, do you have more insurance pump and coverage to add, no, that's enough. View your Updated info. the I live on a Us. Military base outside the Us. I remember the question from earlier. and the answer, of course, was, No. but the way this appears on the screen get. It appears to be saying to me that I do indeed live on a United States military base outside of the US. So you might display this in a way that includes the answer of no.

288
00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:13.149
Hieu (Moderator): so that I'm not led to believe that this is incorrect. There's a possibility of confusion. There

290
00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:17.540
P7: break.

291
00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:25.479
Hieu (Moderator): I just wanna say I live, or my hometown is Sacramento. So I'm very familiar with Folsom.

292
00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:28.670
P7: Oh, yeah, I'm in Sacramento County. Yeah. And while. That is good financial information. I apparently misspelled my spouse's last name when I filled that in. So I'm gonna edit it. Fix that 8 correct dollar income by 1 million dollars. 
Okay. I thought I had entered. Yes, the party, but apparently not so. This is a good conference which wait a minute. That switched me from yes to 9. What? Yes. Okay? Interesting. So there's a immediately below that is an update page And if I tap that it switches from yes to no. So I think that button is in the wrong place. because I believe it really wants me to to fill in the the Medicare. Effective date first. So do you understand what I'm saying? Yeah, so it's an awkward placement of that button.

315
00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:59.159
Hieu (Moderator): Can you hear me?

316
00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:05.600
P7: I can hear you something went wonky with my sound.

317
00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:06.870
Hieu (Moderator): Sure.

318
00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:11.180
P7: Thank you. Label something. Let me get to the zoom thing again.

320
00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:31.019
Hieu (Moderator): Can you hear me now? Nope. okay.

322
00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:49.020
we can hear you, though.

323
00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:55.150
Hieu (Moderator): Okay, I don't think I can hear you anymore. ----. I think he muted himself.

325
00:39:10.610 --> 00:39:12.050
Cecilia Doporto: He is showing us mute.

326
00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:13.800
Hieu (Moderator): Yeah.

327
00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:17.370
P7: okay, you're back.

328
00:39:17.770 --> 00:39:22.509
Hieu (Moderator): Can you hear me now? No, okay. I don't think he can hear me. So it's one of his sound function on his computer.

330
00:39:45.730 --> 00:39:46.580
P7: The

331
00:39:46.700 --> 00:40:02.479
Hieu (Moderator): can you speak again? Now, please. Okay, can you hear me? Now? I hear you. Okay. Okay. Great great placement of the update page button. It should be below the but kind of part, a effective page or effective date.

334
00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:16.429
P7: I think so. I haven't got that far to find out yet. So I'm gonna we'll we'll work through it. So now I'm gonna edit for the effective date. the. that's when I turn 65. I'm guessing, that's it.

338
00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:52.080
And

339
00:40:53.210 --> 00:41:01.450
P7: what is your Medicare claim number on the front of your Medicare card? Good question.

340
00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:03.970
sleepy.

341
00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:12.880
P7: enslaved. I have my advantage, which is the Medicare clean. so I don't have a Medicare card. So this whole thing may be I may be going down the wrong path because I have a Medicare advantage plan instead of straight Medicare. Hmm, I don't have 11 digit Medicare claim number. do I have? I have an 11 digit member. Id. So I will put that in and hope that it's the same thing that you're asking for. Okay. Now, we'll try the update. Oh, we've got a new update page button. Yeah. So that update page button up there really shouldn't be there at all. It only caused problems. So I'm gonna try this update page button. Yes, stuck. September 19 date stuck. And again, the providing all the information that I entered would be helpful or would be reassuring

357
00:43:27.590 --> 00:43:28.700
Hieu (Moderator): right

358
00:43:29.830 --> 00:43:31.920
P7: without having to edit again. So alright. Moving on

360
00:43:40.690 --> 00:43:41.410
2.

361
00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:47.330
P7: That stuff. privacy, policy and an external link more about the assignment and benefits. And I'm skipping over all of that
 because I confirm it without actually reading it.

366
00:44:08.610 --> 00:44:11.930
Hieu (Moderator): Okay? So for our purposes.

367
00:44:14.430 --> 00:44:15.210
P7: Yes.

368
00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:17.419
Hieu (Moderator): Can you scroll down?

369
00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:18.730
P7: -Hmm.

370
00:44:22.410 --> 00:44:23.460
Hieu (Moderator): Okay. Think you're fine? Here we'll stop here for now. I don't think you made the check, and then you were able to submit. So that was interesting. There was a confirmation check that you're supposed to be checked before you submit.

374
00:44:40.970 --> 00:44:42.950
P7: Yeah, we see one

375
00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:52.400
Hieu (Moderator): that chuck box right towards underneath the agreement. You're able to submit before that. So we'll stop to right here. And at this page. What would you normally do here?

377
00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:28.249
P7: I wouldn't do anything. I wouldn't print the page because II know I've done this and the information that's going to appear on the page is information I already have. So I think I'm done.

379
00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:33.820
Hieu (Moderator): Okay. okay, for our purposes. We can stop the study right here

381
00:45:41.050 --> 00:45:48.549
P7: now regarding the submit you were telling me earlier not to submit it, and apparently I have. What do we do about that?

382
00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:55.990
Hieu (Moderator): I did not know that you can go through that without. So I have to contact the the back end to sea. How they can resolve that!

384
00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:02.920
P7: Can you scroll down a little bit here. Sure.

385
00:46:03.110 --> 00:46:11.080
Hieu (Moderator): just cause I wasn't expecting you to be able to submit without making that check mark. But I will have to make a note on that here.

386
00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:15.030
P7: Now, should I go back and try to fix it while I'm here?

387
00:46:16.290 --> 00:46:18.069
Hieu (Moderator): We can try to do that.

388
00:46:18.970 --> 00:46:21.159
P7: Go back to the header, Gov. Or maybe I should go to that link. You sent me that link the first time.

390
00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:33.710
Hieu (Moderator): But yeah, for

391
00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:40.930
P7: in our case I'll have to ask my engineers to kind of erase that information from the on the back side. Right?

392
00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:49.649
Hieu (Moderator): That's why it caught me off guard when you're able to submit without making that check.

393
00:46:49.830 --> 00:46:51.430
P7: Yeah, I understand I was a software developer in a past life.

395
00:46:58.430 --> 00:47:02.370
Hieu (Moderator): Okay, let's try that again. Start and then from here and then go down and then click, continue here. And then from here scroll down. There is a kind of finish, this form later. right above the back page. Yeah, click on that link. Finish this form later.

400
00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:28.459
P7: Right? About that. Yeah, right there it? Why, why, that one

401
00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:32.270
Hieu (Moderator): why, that one. So it takes you to. and it takes you to like you stopped here, Page, and then we'll erase the form from there. So

404
00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:45.129
P7: oh, wait a minute. Oh. notice! See what happened there. Home address is the same finish this form later, and it changes to no

408
00:47:57.380 --> 00:48:02.580
Hieu (Moderator): interesting. Okay, you are catching lots of little things today.

409
00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:06.000
P7: That's why we're doing this. Yeah, sure.

410
00:48:06.310 --> 00:48:08.550
Hieu (Moderator): Okay, can you click? Yes. And then we'll instead of doing a finished form. We'll do continue and then scroll to the bottom here, and then see if you can press the finish this form later. Here. yeah. And then from here you do start a new form.

415
00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:33.249
P7: Good. Umhm. Okay. yes, I believe you're in progress. Excellent.

416
00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:43.720
Hieu (Moderator): Okay. But I'll have to contact the engineers, just to make sure from the back end that we're able to erase whatever. If if it actually got through, we'll erase that for you.

417
00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:48.379
P7: Okay, thank you. So we reached the end of

418
00:48:48.430 --> 00:48:53.280
Hieu (Moderator): that study. You can stop screen. Yeah? And then you can exit out of all those windows if you like. And then thank you for that. So that concludes the kind of study portions of the The interview today. I just wanna note that once the final version is released, you may be prompted to update your health care, benefit information. and the form may look differently just because you know, you're working with a Beta version, and then the final form may look different. Do you have anything else that you would like to add to what we talked about today?

424
00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:51.610
P7:  just a general sense of simplify, simplify, simplify.

425
00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:59.220
Hieu (Moderator): Okay. Now that it's very good to hear. that is kind of our overall directive to kind of make it as simple as possible. Do you have any additional questions for me. Thank you. You know, our session has been incredibly helpful. You've been able to kind of get in there in the needy greedy and gave us a few different kind of cases that we didn't find before. So that's great to see that, you know, when you, when problem arises at the Beta testing. We love it so we can resolve it before it releases. Exactly. I want to circle back and reconfirm that you are comfortable if we choose to share a video clip of this session with our Va partners. Okay? Great any part of the video that you're uncomfortable with sharing. Okay, great again, we really really appreciate you taking your time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback should be incredibly helpful for us to continue the work, to make the site better and make sure it works for all veteran. And then, lastly, pridging will send you a thank you. Note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other veterans, that you may know if they're interested in kind of participating in future studies as well.

433
00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:23.580
P7: Okay, okay, thank you again. Enjoy the rest of your day. You're welcome you, too. Bye. Now bye, bye.
