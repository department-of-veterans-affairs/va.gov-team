00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:08.990
Hieu (Moderator): So I've started recording. I like to confirm that you are comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today.

2
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.169
P5: Yep, that's fine.

3
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:18.640
Hieu (Moderator): Okay? And then, are you comfortable? We decide to use the recorded clips in our discussion today to share with our Va partners.

4
00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:19.719
P5: Yep, that's fine.

5
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:25.940
Hieu (Moderator): Alright! Thank you for that. Get right into the the actual study. Now we'll start off with a few warm up questions. Do you have a service connected disability at Va.

7
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.220
P5: Yes.

8
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.130
Hieu (Moderator): what is your disability rating

9
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.640
P5: 100?

10
00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.859
Hieu (Moderator): Okay? And then, when was the last time you visited a VA medical facility?

11
00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.239
P5: It's definitely last month. maybe earlier this month. Cairo, I can't, can't quite remember. But recently.

13
00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.379
Hieu (Moderator): So yeah, that's that's pretty recent. Can you kind of share any past experience in regards to kind of updating your healthcare benefit information

15
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.929
P5: as far as going on the web page and doing it

16
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.100
Hieu (Moderator): just in general. So like updating your dependent spouse.

17
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:26.119
P5: Last time I did. It was about 2 years ago when I first moved here, and it seemed pretty smooth.

18
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.160
Hieu (Moderator): Can you kind of elaborate on that with that in person online.

19
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.200
P5: I want to say I did it online and just went to the I can't think of it off the top of my head. But yeah, I'm pretty sure I did it online. Cause we had moved from Ohio to here. I see. And then, for from what you recall, it was a very smooth experience.

23
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:53.610
Hieu (Moderator): Gotcha. Imagine you will have been notified to update your financial information in order to maintain kind of your copay and health care benefit. How might you go about doing that?

26
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.850
P5: I would start by going to VA.gov like. There's a profile that I would go to, and then kind of just dig down and through there. So for you, it's pretty straightforward in terms of Va. Then profile. And you expect that's where you'll find that information. That's where I would think to find it. Yeah.

30
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:35.700
Hieu (Moderator): okay. And then, can you describe your prefer method of notification to update these information

31
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.780
P5: text message.

32
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:44.779
Hieu (Moderator): text message. Yeah, cause, I'm kind of retired. So I don't always check my email all the time I got you. So Texas, the best way to kind of reach you and get that update. And then. by the step. I guess you already touch a little bit touch on this. But it was like, how would you expect to update your information online? What specific steps would you take?

36
00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:11.540
P5: And it sounds like you want it to go to straight to the profile and expect something. There, that's where I would think to look for it. Yeah. Okay, I don't know if that's good. I guess maybe it depends on if you're going to benefits, or if you're looking at health. I don't know. The profile would probably be the easiest.

40
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.990
Hieu (Moderator): And then that would include for the health care updates as well for you?

41
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:39.709
P5: I would think so. Yeah. like, if I had additional health care coverage is that we've talked about? Yeah, yeah.

42
00:03:40.020 --> 00:04:07.560
Hieu (Moderator): okay, sounds good. We'll move on to the next portion here. So in this portion you'll be interacting with a beta version of the website today. This is a tool that has not been released and may not function exactly the way you expect it to. Since it is linked to a Va system, it will show you your real information. So towards the end I'll just remind you not to submit anything just because it is linked to the Va system. For this next scenario. Imagine if you started a new job and your healthcare insurance has changed because of it. Now, you realize you need to update your insurance detail for your Va benefit to do that, you decide to go on Google search to find out where you can update that information. Google takes you to this page on the v. 8 that you're about to see. And then for the scenario. Are you comfortable with sharing your screen to talk through your process? Yes. Okay, please be sure to close any kind of personal information like email or Facebook, and then I will share a link with you and let me paste this in the chat. Here there is the link in the chat.

48
00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.039
P5: Where is my zoom just updated? Where would I go to share my screen? So at the bottom of your zoom screen there is a green button that says, share screen.

51
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.420
Hieu (Moderator): It's going to be mute stop video security events, share screen. Yeah, this one.

54
00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.210
P5: Yes, okay. I do see it. Like, I'm looking away. Yep.

56
00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:15.040
Hieu (Moderator): and then so on this page you have arrived on this place. Page. Please take a few minutes to review this page and explain what content on the content on this page, and what it means to you? And then what would you naturally do afterwards? And then, please kind of talk out loud and in terms of like processes.

58
00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:31.819
P5: Honestly, I don't think I've ever really looked through this page. I just go straight to sign in  But yeah, I would just sign in right here.

60
00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.510
Hieu (Moderator): I see. So typically you would just sign in right away. Can we go? Can we go back? We'll just stay on that page for a bit. Okay, yeah, we stay on this page for a bit, cause we'll talk about this page. So normally you wouldn't really read this, and you just jump right in.

63
00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:00.560
P5: Yes, usually cause I'm just looking at. If I log in, it's mostly to look at like test results or upcoming appointments and stuff like that. So

65
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:13.430
Hieu (Moderator): when I moved here 2 years ago, was to like, kind of change my information. Yeah, so you have a task you want to finish, and then you jump in to to do that. I got you for our purposes. We'll kind of hang out here on this page a little bit longer. Kind of ask you some questions on this page. So as you're scrolling down here, is there anything that stood out to you that doesn't make sense or confusing what it or anything like that.

69
00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:43.140
P5: Nope at all. And it I mean, it tells you everything what you can't update and it all seems pretty straightforward.

71
00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:52.330
Hieu (Moderator): But this is also not normally what you would do.

72
00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:53.370
P5: No. typically, but it's just That's what I need to do this. how I get to it. So I don't typically look at the login screen too much.

77
00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:06.040
Hieu (Moderator): I gotcha. And then on a scale of one to 5, one being very poorly and 5 being very well. How prepared does this page make you feel about the form you're about to begin?

79
00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:20.490
P5: 5? I mean, it has all the information. I think that especially somebody that doesn't use technology enough might benefit from.

81
00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:37.139
Hieu (Moderator): Hmm, I see. And then do you have any suggestion that or feedback for kind of making this page or update process better.

83
00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:40.889
P5: I can't think of any.

84
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:53.110
Hieu (Moderator): I got it out pretty well. Okay. So for so you're just looking at a mockup of the website. Now, we'll actually go into the real website for this portion. Can you open a a new window and kind of sign on to your Va. Gov account, like you normally would.

86
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:19.110
P5: That's weird.

87
00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:43.910
The

88
00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:11.319
Hieu (Moderator): okay. Since you're logged in, I will give you this link. that hopefully when you click will direct you to

89
00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:14.169
P5: another page. Okay.

90
00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:18.800
Hieu (Moderator): because you are signed in, you should be able to get access to this page.

91
00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:23.539
P5: and so

92
00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:30.539
Hieu (Moderator): you can access it on your zoom chat window. Let's see if you can click the link from there. It will be the second link that I pasted.

96
00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:52.909
P5: but nobody use. Oh, here we go. For some reason my bar was like all the way over here.

99
00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:19.050
Hieu (Moderator): It's not directing you to the right page. Would it be possible for you to kind of copy and paste that link? Yeah. it's loading interesting. Is this the same account you used that you provided us, too. That you previously provide us to sign in. It should be

103
00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:47.690
P5: okay. Cause. I only have the one va account.

104
00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:51.610
Hieu (Moderator): Let's try one more time to. So to sign into that. So yeah, sign up from there and see if you can click on the link alright doesn't. Yeah. Give that a shot

110
00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:29.040
P5: 1Â s.

111
00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:31.560
Simpson.

112
00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:22.310
Hieu (Moderator): Oh, my gosh, no! Let's not do this. So this is the only email that you used to login to the Va right? Usually I log in with the my health event. But it's not

114
00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:33.240
P5: working for some reason.

115
00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:42.620
Hieu (Moderator): And then, is this the same email you used to kind of provide us earlier.

116
00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:43.830
P5: Yep.

117
00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:46.770
Hieu (Moderator): okay. if that's the case. maybe we'll just try this. I'll give you a second to try that, and then, if not, I do have a backup.

119
00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:25.079
P5: Oh, my gosh. okay, let's try. This. Feel like this part could be easier.

122
00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:49.260
Hieu (Moderator): Hmm.

123
00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:59.920
P5: okay. Why is that not letting me log in?

124
00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:56.449
Hieu (Moderator): Okay, so try one more time. Okay, that doesn't work. So that's not a problem. We'll do our backup. So I will share my screen here.

126
00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:05.530
P5: Okay.

127
00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:08.350
Hieu (Moderator): I can stop you from sharing screen.

128
00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:12.179
P5: Or can you stop sharing screen? Okay?

129
00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:21.679
Hieu (Moderator): And then what I would do is I'll sign into our test user account and then share my screen with you. And then we can go through the product that way.

131
00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:24.180
P5: Okay.

132
00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:31.200
Hieu (Moderator): please give me a few moments to set this up. But, as I mentioned before, because this is technically I, a new feature. not everything goes smoothly.

135
00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.220
P5: That's one. Okay. So it looks like. okay, can I share my screen back with you this one? So when I type in the link. it still just goes. But it's logged in now. but it still won't let me. That is not a problem.

143
00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:57.459
Hieu (Moderator): We'll we'll do a different route for this study. I will share my screen, and then we'll go through it that way.

145
00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:18.240
P5: Let me stop that. Okay.

146
00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:24.830
Hieu (Moderator): Okay. Now, can you see my screen? Yep, I can see it. Okay. Great. Let me adjust everything real quick.

148
00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:34.639
Hieu (Moderator): Everything's moved around a bit. Okay, so on this screen. this is after you sign in. And then you get to this screen. really similar to the previous page. But this is what happens when you sign in into that update screen. You have arrived at this page. Now please take a few moments to review this page and explain the content on this page and what it means to you. And please let me know if I need to make the screen bigger for you.

153
00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:12.120
P5: Okay, you can scroll down. Okay? So then I would click, start a new form.

156
00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:31.579
Hieu (Moderator): Okay? So can you please summarize the most important information you found on this page to prepare you for this form.

157
00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:38.800
P5:  basically, you just need to know, you need to probably just have your okay? So I'm probably okay. What would the deductible expenses be?

160
00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:58.179
Hieu (Moderator): Would that something that would cause you to kind of pause and hesitate to to start the form.

161
00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:10.390
P5: Yes, but only because I'm a military brat. And then I was in the military. and then I still have tricare va, so I've never really dealt with real healthcare. real. I said. Real health care other like blue cross, blue shields and stuff like that. So that would give me pause. Yes.

164
00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:22.150
Hieu (Moderator): Gotcha, so you need some clarification on that portion. and then, just like before, on a scale of one to 5, one being very poorly and 5 being very well, how prepared is this page make you feel about the form you're about to begin

166
00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:39.090
P5: other than just my own, not knowing what that is. A 5.

167
00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:44.240
Hieu (Moderator): Okay. And then do you have any suggestion or feedback for this page? So far?

168
00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:49.660
P5:  only if there was like actual documents that you might need like W. 2, or whatever, if that was listed, might make it a little bit easier.

170
00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:07.060
Hieu (Moderator): Gotcha. So you want to know if that's required to kind of attach or upload, if you will, or sent in.

171
00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:12.250
P5: or even if you just had a W. 2, that would make it easier to fill out the form. or you know something that might make it easier.

173
00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:17.820
Hieu (Moderator): Gotcha. All right. For our purposes. We will continue, and we'll start with a new form here.

175
00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:25.050
P5: Okay?

176
00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:34.460
Hieu (Moderator): And then, obviously, this won't be your data now, because this is just a a test account. But you know, in actuality, if you were to sign in it would be your personal information. You won't be a marked polar bear. but Let's go through this form as if you know it's you, and then could you kind of talk out loud as your thought process as you're going through this?

180
00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:02.210
P5:  okay. yes. Information. That's easy. So I'd hit next. Okay, so you would continue right away.  I mean, that looks easy. So I would just uncheck that because I don't live on our base. and then just put in whatever addresses.

184
00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:25.470
Hieu (Moderator): Okay.

185
00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:29.659
P5: it's a pretty straightforward for you. And then I hit. Yes, because it is the same as my mailing Gotcha.

187
00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:42.729
Hieu (Moderator): and then up here. is the pre kind of the prefill information helpful for you. What's your thought process on that?

188
00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:46.400
P5: If that's already what you have on file. Yes, that would be helpful. Because if I'm only changing something later. then anything that you guys already have would be a lot easier

192
00:22:56.360 --> 00:23:03.340
Hieu (Moderator):  and then you said, yes, that says the same. We'll continue with that past that out Alaska.

194
00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:15.930
P5: Next page here. See from an email. Oh, that's also super helpful. So yep, I would just hit. Continue

196
00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:22.190
Hieu (Moderator): gotcha

197
00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:31.110
P5: the marriage

198
00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:42.330
Hieu (Moderator): no concern so far. Okay, so, Mary. And then you've click, continue. Go ahead.

200
00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:51.280
P5: Well, I was just gonna say if it if I had any questions about why you were asking for it, you guys had a link. So I would just click that

201
00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:55.940
Hieu (Moderator): gotcha. And then here.

202
00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:02.299
P5: I would imagine, if you guys already had that information, this would be pre-filled. which theoretically should already have it. So you expected my benefits properly. Yeah. Yeah.

206
00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:22.840
Hieu (Moderator): And then, if if you didn't, you would just go in and fill these out and just fill it out. Yeah.

207
00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:27.440
P5: for our purposes. I'm just gonna put generic stuff here in here.

208
00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:28.450
Hieu (Moderator): heck

209
00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:31.360
and

210
00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:36.260
Hieu (Moderator): just click numbers.

211
00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:55.179
P5: And then you would just continue and then hit, continue. Yup.

212
00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:56.410
Hieu (Moderator): okay.

213
00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:01.600
P5: and yes, and yes. and continue

215
00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:06.750
Hieu (Moderator): okay.

216
00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:10.730
P5: Yes. and then continue.

218
00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:19.469
Hieu (Moderator): So. Everything is pretty straightforward for you so far.

219
00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:23.359
P5: and if I wasn't sure, then you guys have the dropdown that I would click gotcha. So you're aware that.

221
00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:28.670
Hieu (Moderator): Gotcha?

222
00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:32.560
P5: No issues for you so far. Nope, no issues. And then I would just fill that in if it wasn't already pre-billed

224
00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:40.780
Hieu (Moderator): gotcha.

225
00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:50.280
P5: that doesn't matter. Yeah.

226
00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:53.710
Hieu (Moderator): and take a number again and then continue.

228
00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:15.150
P5: Oh, so, if so, I have a question. So my son was adopted. so his date of birth would be whatever, and so Tricare covered it from the day he was born. But he didn't officially become my dependent until about 4 months later. Gotcha. I don't know if it would be. If that's kind of what you guys are looking for, or I don't know might be worth adding something about adoption, something like that on there. You want some clarification on here on this portion. Yes, Gotcha covered it technically. He didn't become my dependent until later. So that's how I fill it out. But that might not necessarily be correct.

236
00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:07.810
Hieu (Moderator): Gotcha. So in your mind it makes sense. Let's say in this purpose, it would. Okay, I got you. But you want some clarification just to. If that's what you guys are asking for, like, if it's

238
00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:17.940
P5: an adoption type issue.

239
00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:20.390
Hieu (Moderator): Gotcha. Thank you for that. And then with that, continue. okay.

242
00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:31.890
P5: no. yes. no. And then continue. Okay, then Nope. and continue. oh. okay. just look at either W. 2 or tax return, I guess.

249
00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:10.800
Hieu (Moderator): And then how long do you think that would typically take you to get that information.

250
00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:13.520
P5: Hmm! Like 5Â min or so, just to look through my file cabinet. It's not a big time-conservient deal.

254
00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:27.120
Hieu (Moderator): Gotcha, so it's not something that would force you to pause the

255
00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:32.460
P5: process. It's like right there behind me.

256
00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:37.060
Hieu (Moderator): gotcha. Pretty quick turnaround time for you. And then what about this net income from property or from farm and property.

258
00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:46.650
P5: Okay? I mean, yeah, that's pretty straightforward. Cause. I feel like that would also be on your tax returns.

261
00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:55.560
Hieu (Moderator): Okay? So for you that'd be pretty straightforward as well. And then other income.

263
00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:03.130
P5: Can you click the dropdown? Okay, yeah. So it has. Yup, that's pretty straightforward. And then again, no problem trying to find this information filling that. Okay? And then continue. okay. see? Okay, that's straightforward. And it should all be with the same tax paperwork. So that's easy.

271
00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:38.520
Hieu (Moderator): Okay.

272
00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:41.679
P5: seamless for you. So far. Nope, same thing. And then continue. see? Okay, that's easy. And then locational and expenses. That's pretty easy. I feel like you guys haven't asked this before. Okay, this is new to you.

279
00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:11.929
Hieu (Moderator): And how does that make you feel?

280
00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:16.090
P5: I mean, it's fine. I just. I've never filled this in before. I don't think, or if I did, it was 2,012 when I first started my Va stuff, so I got you. It could have asked for it, you know, 11 years ago. Right? So you're not expecting this this portion at all. But it's fine. Doesn't take that much time

286
00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:44.870
Hieu (Moderator): and continue. Yup, continue. Sorry. Okay. not a problem.

288
00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:52.830
P5: I don't know. So and I'll just say, Continue no, continue. No.

290
00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:57.990
Hieu (Moderator): and continue.

291
00:30:58.160 --> 00:30:59.510
P5: Yep. Continue. Sorry. Okay, so the I would say, yes.

294
00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:23.859
Hieu (Moderator): Did you need some kind of clarification?

295
00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:25.190
P5: Okay.

296
00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:29.170
Hieu (Moderator): okay, so pretty straightforward again for you.

297
00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:34.990
P5: So then that would be trigger. and I would put my spouse's name. Think the policy number would be the 80 IP. Whatever that number is. cause that's not social anymore. So it should be the I, Ed. PIDI. P. Whatever that number is. Now, the Dod number benefits number I'm assuming, that's what that is. Oh, there you go. I would just click that dropdown. There you go. Yep. okay. So you could use it. Use either one. Okay? So yeah, I would just look at that and type that in

305
00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:23.700
Hieu (Moderator): Gotcha.

306
00:32:29.570 --> 00:32:32.510
P5: hopefully, that lets me through. And then next. okay. do you have more? No. and continue. I don't think okay. So then I guess I would just click each one of those just to verify information is accurate. Yeah, I would just scroll down. That's good. that all looks good. Okay? Then that one just a check. Okay? Submitting. Okay, that's all straightforward. So check the box and then hit. Submit.

314
00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:30.130
Hieu (Moderator): Okay. So everything has been very straightforward for you.

315
00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:32.710
P5: I don't think you have any major blockers.

316
00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:36.350
Hieu (Moderator): and then nothing's stopping you from kind of finishing the form out.

317
00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:37.230
P5: Nope.

318
00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:49.319
Hieu (Moderator): okay, so good thing it the great thing about this is that because I'm just using here, I don't have to remind you to not submit the form. So I'll stop there. Let me bring back my window here. and then Oh, I can't submit. That's right. Let me try this. Okay.

324
00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:17.459
P5: I do have one more page for you to look at.

325
00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:26.750
Hieu (Moderator): So after after you submit. you come to this page. and then I want to hear your thought process on this page.

326
00:34:26.830 --> 00:34:29.679
P5: Okay? So you've submitted your form. update it. And then. okay. pretty awesome name. Might take 5 days. Yeah, that's all. Pretty straightforward. Hmm. kind of gives you a timeframe of when you can expect a correspondence or

331
00:34:56.159 --> 00:35:00.590
Hieu (Moderator): right, and then normally, do you? Would you print this at all? Or

332
00:35:00.730 --> 00:35:03.079
P5: no, I would not okay. although probably most military people probably would. just because they've had so many records lost while they were in the military.

334
00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:21.779
Hieu (Moderator): But for you yourself you wouldn't. Okay. But the information shown on this page. it's pretty straightforward for you. Simple. Yeah. Gotcha. Okay, thank you for that. Okay, now stop sharing. II forgot that I can get to this page because it's a a test account, whereas, yeah, where's yours? I would ask you to stop. Okay, so with that. I think we can kind of pause or complete the study there. Once the final version is released, you may be prompted to kind of update your health care information. And the final version may look different from the one you're seeing that you have seen today. Just because once we go through the final touches, and will be, you know, a different experience if you will. Do you have any questions or any concerns so far in terms of that whole experience you just went through.

340
00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:16.210
P5: No, that's pretty straightforward.

341
00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:19.299
Hieu (Moderator): Okay? And then, do you have any questions for me?

342
00:36:20.330 --> 00:36:21.449
P5: I don't think so. I just appreciate you guys doing the different studies and try to make it easier. especially for some of the older folks that I work with.

347
00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:39.979
Hieu (Moderator): Yeah, we're always appreciative feedback, and we're trying to make it work for everyone. I just want to circle back and reconfirm that you are comfortable. If we share a video clip with a video clip of this session with our Va partners. Okay? And then just to remind you, if we do choose to do that, we'll remove any identifying information. And then do you have any portion of that of today's recording that you're uncomfortable. With that you want me to leave out.

350
00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:07.399
P5: Nope, everything is fine.

351
00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:17.970
Hieu (Moderator): Sounds good. Again, we really appreciate you taking your time to share your thoughts and opinions with us today. Your feedback's gonna be really helpful in terms of kind of continue working. Allow us to continue to work on the website and making it better for all veterans. And then, lastly, bridging will send you a thank you. Note with a blurb that you can pass to other veteran who, you know, that might want to participate in future studies.

354
00:37:34.270 --> 00:37:35.140
P5: Okay. thank you. Again, have someone in mind 20 something years ago. So he doesn't. He just goes into the BA and is like, this is what I need like, hey? If you could get all this information on this web page? Well, that's weird. So yeah. very helpful. Yes.

358
00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:14.779
Hieu (Moderator): alright! Thank you for that. Have a great day for the rest of your day. Thank you.

359
00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:16.640
P5: Alright, bye, sorry.
