## First Task: [Notifications and Awareness] - 5 minutes

- Can you share any past experiences regarding updates to your health benefits information?
  > As far as going on the webpage and doing it?
  > The last time I did it was about 2 years ago when I first moved here and it was pretty smooth
  > I want to say I went online, I can't think of it off the top of my head, but I did it online, when we moved.
- Imagine you've been notified to update your financial information in order to maintain your co-pay and health care benefits. How might you go about doing that?
> I would start by going to VA.gov, um, I feel like there is a Profile I would go to then did down from there

- Describe your preferred method of notification to update your health care information.
  > text message, I am kind of retired so I don't check email all the time

### Things to watch for:

- [What's the participant's mental model around updating their health care information?]
- [If they have updated their health care benefits information before, was it in person, by phone, or by mail?]


## Second Task: [Wayfinding - Static Page] - 5 minutes

- **You'll be interacting with a beta version of the website today.** This tool has not been released and it may not function exactly the way you expect. Since it is linked to the VA system, it will show you your real information. Towards the end, I will remind you not to submit anything.
- For this next scenario, imagine you just started a new job and your health insurance has changed because of it. Now, you've realized that you need to update your insurance details for your VA health care benefit. To do that, you decided to search on Google to find out how and where you can update your information. Google takes you to this page on VA.gov you're about to see. For this scenario, are you comfortable with sharing your screen and talking through your thought process?
- Please be sure to close any personal information, like email, Facebook, etc., before you share your screen.

## Fourth Task: [The Form] - 10 minutes

- For this next task, we are going to have you go through the form as if you were prompted to update your information. This is a special beta version of the form, accessible via the email you provided before its official release. Please be careful not to submit unless you intend to update your health benefits information for real.
- As you go through the form, could you please talk aloud about what you would need to do as you go.

> An email, that is super helpful
> I would just hit continue 
> and Married
> Oh, I was just going to say, if I had any questions you guys had a link, I would click that
> I would imagine if you guys already have this, it should be prefilled (spouse info)
> I would just fill it out,  (moderator generic inputs)
> And then yes and yes (spouse add info)
> Yes (has dependents)
> If I wasn't sure, you guys have the drop down that I would click, yeah that's perfect.
> And then I would just fill that in if it wasn't already prefilled
> Oh... so, if I have a question.
> My son was adopted. So his date of birth would be whatever, so TriCare would cover him when he was born, but he didn't become my dependnet until 4 months later.
> Wants clarification - on adoptive children for the 2 dates
> If that what you guys are asking for if it is an adoption type issue.
> No, no and then continue
> And then no (additional dependents) and then continue
> Okay... so I would look at my W2 or tax return I guess
> It would take 5 minutes or so, look through my file cabinet
> It should be right there behind me (points in office)
> Yeah, that is pretty straightforward. Feel like that would also be on your tax return.
> Can you click the drop down (other income)
> That is pretty straight forward.. and then continue
> Um, let's see. That is straight forward and should be with the same tax paper work so that is easy
> (deductible expenses page)

Insurnace section
> no, continue
> No, continue
> (doesn't really pause on Medicare/Medicaid questions)
> I would say yes (private insurnace question)
> So that would be TriCare, and then put my Spouse's name
> I think the policy number would be the EDI whatever that number is, that is not Social anymore
> EDIP, EDIP the DOD benefits number
> Oh, there you go, I would just click that drop down
> And then next, do you have more, no
> Okay, so I guess I would just click each one of those to verify the information is accurate
> Scroll down, that's good
> And that one just to check, okay
> Submitting... (quietly reads) okay, that's all straigtforward
> Then I check the box and hit submit 

Confirmation Page
