### Things to watch for:

- [What's the participant's mental model around updating their health care information?]
- [If they have updated their health care benefits information before, was it in person, by phone, or by mail?]


## Second Task: [Wayfinding - Static Page] - 5 minutes

- **You'll be interacting with a beta version of the website today.** This tool has not been released and it may not function exactly the way you expect. Since it is linked to the VA system, it will show you your real information. Towards the end, I will remind you not to submit anything.
- For this next scenario, imagine you just started a new job and your health insurance has changed because of it. Now, you've realized that you need to update your insurance details for your VA health care benefit. To do that, you decided to search on Google to find out how and where you can update your information. Google takes you to this page on VA.gov you're about to see. For this scenario, are you comfortable with sharing your screen and talking through your thought process?
- Please be sure to close any personal information, like email, Facebook, etc., before you share your screen.
- [Share link to (https://staging.va.gov/health-care/update-health-information-1/) in Zoom chat]


- You arrived at this page. Please take a few minutes to review this page and explain what the content on this page means to you and then what you would do next.
> (scrolls thorugh page quietly)
> Ok I am reading it, it looks like just general information
> Income information for you and your spouse and any dependents you may have
> And deductible expenses from 2022, that would come off our tax return I would assume
> And the VA would determine if I need to make a copay for medicines.
> Update the personal information, email, phone number mailing address.
> List all insurance that covers me
> The privacy act statement and if I need help, there are phone numbers for me to call.
> Or contact the local Veteran Services Organization.
> Yes, I think what I would do, first of all find my tax return for the year 2022 and then I think we could probably go ahead and fill out the form after that.
> I know my health insurance easily
> 5 - I have confidence in the VA. When i have filled out forms in the past, I didn't have trouble with them.
> It is a good way to report to the VA what the VA needs. I am fairly organized with my home finances and know how to get the form from the VA
> (process better) No, I can't see anyway to imrove it. It looks like you folks have done a good job with it.

> It saves time when filling out forms if they can pre load this stuff.

> Ok, mailing address. I do not live outside the United States.
> It is already prefilled with my street address, my town, my state, my zip code.
> Click yes if your home is the same as mailing address, that is correct.
> Should I continue?
(form drops at bottom, thows participant)
> Phone and email address. I do not have a smart phone or mobile phone so that is blank and that is correct.

> Household financial information
> Married, thats correct
> Continue
> Spouse information, oh that is not filled in
> Do you wish me to fill it in now?
> (completes spouse information)
> Social secuity (prompted to make one up) Good, I don't have her number handy
> It would take me a moment if I was actually filling out the form. I would want to make sure that is the correct number.
> Spouse date of birth, I think I know that...
> I am not absolutley sure that is correct, I might be off by a day or two. It doesn't have to be exact at this moment does it?
> Alright, date of marriage. November...
> The form has been saved and it has a form ID number assigned to it, so I will continue.
> (reads questions out loud - live with questions)
> Do you have any dependents to report? Who we consider... No. Continue.
> Annual income, gross income...I will make an estimate of that.

> (quite pause at start of spouses income page)
> (used additional info for other income section)
> (goes on to deductible page, participant concentrating reading through content)

> I have to pay for dental because I am not 100%
> I will just give it a guess


Insurance information
> Now to be eligible for Medicaid, am I eligible for that now?
> They filled in no already, I will just leave it there.
> (how would verify) oh.. I have the basic medicare I guess that is what is called, I do not have part B.
> I would have to get in touch with the medicare people and that could take a while. 
> there we go, this is already prefilled also. Peple over 65, yes I am enrolled in Medicare Part A
> Part A effective date, errr. I assume that would be right after I turned 65.
> They already filled in November 2008... yeah, that would be about 65
