00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:11.450
Katelyn (Moderator): Although I've started the recording, I'd like to confirm that you're okay with me, recording this session with my screen and audio to day.

2
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.319
P9: Yes, I'm okay with you recording this session.

3
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.370
Katelyn (Moderator): Thank you so much. Okay. we're recording. So we are good to go. Oh, that's right. I have one more confirmation for for you. Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other Va partners? If we remove any identifying information.

6
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.699
P9: Yes, that's okay. You can use anything you want.

7
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.189
Katelyn (Moderator): Great. Thank you for getting over that hurdle with me. We can jump into some warm up questions to day. So my first question for you is, do you have a service connected disability at Va.

10
00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.730
P9: yes, I do.

11
00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.529
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay. And what's your disability rating

12
00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.330
P9: 10%?

13
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.440
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay? And when was the last time you visited a Va medical facility.

15
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.469
P9: I actually went to A. VA medical facility this year for the first time in ages. So I don't know exactly when.

17
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.160
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay, so sometime this year, and it had been a little bit of time since since before then.

18
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.289
P9: and I am participating in a Va program called Move.

19
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.260
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay? I'm not aware of it. Could you tell me a bit about that

20
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.450
P9: it's to help you with weight loss.

21
00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:42.720
Katelyn (Moderator): Oh, okay.

22
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:49.799
P9: my book out, but I can't find it. But anyway, it's, I think, a 12 week program. Once a week. We have a video call. And we have like 12 people in our group.

24
00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.860
Katelyn (Moderator): Oh, okay. that's cool. It's always nice to learn about new things Va is doing. Wasn't aware. All right. jumping into that health care information we were. Gonna talk about today. Do you recall a time that you made any updates to your health benefits, information. So any of your personal information? things like that any expenses you had?

29
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.510
P9: No, you know, I do have to say I am retired. Military. So I'm all my healthcare is covered under tricare.

31
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.630
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay? Great. Okay. So we're going to talk about a hypothetical scenario. So imagine that you've been notified to update your financial information in order to maintain your copay and your health care benefits. How might you go about doing that?

35
00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.409
How would I go about doing that?

36
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:18.019
P9:  well, would I get a letter in the mail, or would I get an email? I wondered they'd probably send a letter in the mail. I don't know what I'd do. I'd have to wait until they told me what to do. You know, do they? You know, proof of income? Yeah, I could prove my income.

42
00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.649
Katelyn (Moderator): So is there a little more about that getting started situation you could share like, would you? Expect to be able to do this online? Would you go into a facility?

45
00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.660
P9: Where would you get started? There? I'd rather do it online. And I'd rather just like, Submit, my last year's income tax information, something like that or my. you know, the same way you do your income tax something like that.

47
00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:21.779
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay, yeah, that makes sense. And what about your preferred notification? Telling you to update your healthcare information.

48
00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.469
P9: an email kind of works. and sometimes it does get lost in the email system. And I have noticed the Va. Is pretty good about sending out a letter on some important things. So the Us. Mail helps

51
00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.519
Katelyn (Moderator): for really important

52
00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.989
P9: for important stuff males. Good. Yes.

53
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:56.000
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay. It sounds like, maybe you'd prefer a little bit of both an email and a letter. Okay? And how would you expect to update your information online? So specifically, you're going online to make those updates, what steps would you take

56
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:24.889
P9: well, if they sent me an email and said, Click here to update your information, I could just click and update my information.

57
00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:34.289
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay, so you would like Link to get started there. See? What would be mighty helpful. Okay? And without that link I'm just curious. How you would figure out how to make that update yourself.

60
00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:48.070
P9: I really wouldn't worry about it or bother with it. Okay, unless they gave me some specific information. What they wanted me to do, I wouldn't be doing anything.

62
00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:06.789
Katelyn (Moderator): Gotcha. Okay? Makes sense. Thanks for sharing that. So we're gonna move into a second task here. You'll be interacting with a beta version of the website today. And this tool hasn't been released yet, so it might not function exactly the way you expect. but it is linked to the VA system. So it will show you your real information.

66
00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:23.930
P9: Okay.

67
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:33.019
Katelyn (Moderator): towards the end of the task I will remind you not to submit anything because we do not want to submit anything to our Beta tool.

68
00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:35.910
P9: Don't worry, I won't. I'm lazy when it comes to that stuff

70
00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:44.510
Katelyn (Moderator): that'll that'll be in our favor to day. Okay, I shared a link with you in the chat.

72
00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:56.300
P9: Would you be able to? Yeah, just a minute. Okay, now, I have to. You know. I'm on my ipad. So it's a little different than my computer. Okay? And dang it I'll split the screen oops don't want to do that. I don't know where the chat is on this

79
00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:37.970
Katelyn (Moderator): I'm not totally familiar with the ipad app myself.

80
00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:49.110
P9: And I do my group on the ipad. But the screen is a little different. I wanna turn this a different way. 
Okay, I'm gonna hit the button that says more and chat or chit chat. Okay, all right, I've got chat.

83
00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:03.850
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay, perfect.

84
00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:14.409
P9: Okay. I've clicked on chat. What else would you like me to do.

85
00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:17.929
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay? So you're able to open that link

87
00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:24.089
P9: that I sent you. I'm going to. Is that okay? I'm gonna hit it right now.

89
00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:28.799
Katelyn (Moderator): Yes, that's okay.

90
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:33.609
P9: Okay. It's we're going some place. Okay, I'm here.

91
00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:35.549
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay, great

92
00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:44.889
P9: and are you able to share your screen? Showing that browser window? Just a second. Okay? oh, God. you're asking me technical information that OK. Apps apps, apps. Where do you share your screen. chat apps, show captions, meeting settings. mating settings. Oh, crap! So maybe under meaning settings. Oh, God! Nope! Hang it! Get out of here! Oh, shit! Oh, God, no! Worries!

107
00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:04.529
Katelyn (Moderator): I'm I'm actually trying to open zoom on my own, Ipad to see, if I can help with this

109
00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:15.140
P9:  oh, I am, like, totally lost in your like. I've lost you shoot.

111
00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.799
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay, one of my colleagues. Were you able to find it

113
00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:43.600
P9: just a second? I see. Zoom over here. Let's tap on. Come on. Okay. all right, we're back to this. Yeah. So yeah.

117
00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:13.280
Katelyn (Moderator): oh, great. So on. Zoom, there's a button in the it's for me. It's the top right controls in the middle that says, Share content, and it's green. Are you able to see that?

119
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:32.950
P9:  Dang it!  Dang it! I probably should just use my regular computer, because I just don't and crap, crap, crap, I just don't see how to share the damn screen on the ipad meeting set. How whiteboard? That's not the same, is it?

124
00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:22.370
Katelyn (Moderator): No, for me, it's the top. If you tap on the screen there will be a toolbar the top. Right? You see that

127
00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:37.559
P9: I have a tool bar that says mute, stop video, wait a second share, content, share content. Oh, what did you say. okay, share my screen. share my screen. Yeah, share contacts. Right? There. Okay. okay, alright. okay. Here we are. It's pretty. Okay. should I be clicking on something else here. Okay, you are sharing your screen. Okay? Alright, guys.

136
00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:27.360
Katelyn (Moderator): thank you. I see the zoom window. We're trying to look at the browser window if you're able to go back to safari.

137
00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:33.280
P9: Perfect! Yes, this is exactly what we're going for. Let me have a drink on that one.

138
00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:39.400
Katelyn (Moderator): We made it. Thank you for your patience and getting that to work.

139
00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:45.740
P9: Okay, I've never done this before. So here we go. It's okay.

140
00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:49.000
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay. So now that we've got this screen up. I can tell you about the scenario we're gonna talk about. So just imagine that you started a new job and your health insurance has changed because of that. And you've realized that you need to update your health insurance details for your VA health care benefit. So to do that, you decided to run a search on Google to find out how and where update that information. And then Google takes you to this page on va, gov.

145
00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:23.560
P9: okay, you've arrived at this page.

146
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:27.580
Katelyn (Moderator): Could you just take a few minutes to review the page. explain what the content on this page means to you.
And then what you would do next. Okay.

149
00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:56.970
P9: I'm just laughing. The Va form 10 easy.

150
00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:06.460
Katelyn (Moderator): So why does that make you laugh?

151
00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:09.669
P9: Because that's the IRS. Form. doesn't it make you laugh? Okay, okay, So yeah. Like, if you like got married or divorced, or something, you could change your marital status or your dependent information. okay, I've read it. 
Okay.

157
00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:37.550
Katelyn (Moderator): And what does this? Page mean to you?

158
00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:54.180
P9: Well, what is telling me is that the va wants to be billing other insurances to help cover the cost of my health care if they're totally taken care of me. And yeah. course, this is also telling me that. you know, we're used to the Va, everything being very low, no cost and So I just personally, being a cheapskate, I just want to say that can I use this form to find out if my health benefits will change. Yes, you can update your household financial information and will determine if you need to pay a copay for non service connected care. And you know I'm I rarely use the VA. But I've I know the Va. Is a very inexpensive way to get your health care. and so, if somebody had a job, and they had to report their earning. Then they might not be eligible for free prescription or something. or they might have to pay for their prescription. I don't know, anyway, that's interesting. Just my own opinion.

174
00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:47.190
Yeah, thank you for sharing that.

175
00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:55.480
Katelyn (Moderator): And in that scenario, needing to update that healthcare insurance. What would you do next? After reading through this page.

176
00:18:55.790 --> 00:19:08.940
P9: I would just click on the sign in or create an account. and the only reason I would click. There is because I actually have an account. And I could actually just sign in.

177
00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:10.850
Katelyn (Moderator): okay.

178
00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:13.239
P9: is that your typical? That would be what I would do. because, you know, a modern life, most everything you do on the computer I wouldn't necessarily call cause. That'd probably be a waste of time, and don't think I'd click on something and have them send me something in the mail when I could just as soon click on the account and do it online.

184
00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:42.840
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay? So I understand.

185
00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:45.730
P9: I would click on the sign in to update my information.

187
00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:58.670
Katelyn (Moderator): Great and how would you if I felt I wanted to tell the Va.

188
00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:00.900
Right.

189
00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:06.579
P9: Okay. Now go. Sorry to interrupt. What were you? Gonna say?

190
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:10.000
Katelyn (Moderator): All good. Thank you for sharing all that I was. Gonna ask how you would normally navigate to this page if you're in that scenario.

192
00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:32.629
P9:  well, unfortunately, I don't like if I wanna play solitaire, I could just click on the link of my ipad and hit play solitaire. But to go to this site, II have to type in va.gov and Google and find it in order to click on it, because there is not a little app provided for this.

196
00:20:53.860 --> 00:21:00.620
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay? So you would do a Google search and come to Va. To navigate here.

197
00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:03.459
P9: That's what I do all the time. which is annoying. Why can't I just go to the app store and get the VA. App.

199
00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:15.250
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay, did you have any questions about the information listed here?

201
00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:29.420
P9: Well, I have a comment. It doesn't say it's mandatory. Okay, that stands out to you. It's not required prior military mandatory means. You have to do it. But this is just it. If you want to do it.

204
00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:53.479
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay? And then on a scale of one to 5, with one being very poorly and 5 being very well.

205
00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:58.109
How prepared does this page make you feel about the form you're about to begin.

206
00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:05.740
P9: Just gonna go 3 middle of the road. I don't have a negative or positive.

208
00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:11.730
Okay.

209
00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:17.230
Katelyn (Moderator): and that's why you would give it a 3. You're not feeling super confident, but not not confident.

211
00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:22.239
P9: Yeah. In middle of the road.

212
00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:25.539
Katelyn (Moderator): Middle of the road. Okay.

213
00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:26.960
P9: yeah. You have.

214
00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:35.199
Katelyn (Moderator): Do you have any suggestions for? I'm improving this page or any feedback for making this process better.

215
00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:42.049
P9: Let's see. It tells me how to update the VA benefits. Why do I want to update the Va benefits?

218
00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:59.599
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay, so you're looking for a little more context on why you would do this.

219
00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:00.780
P9: Why.

220
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:10.150
Katelyn (Moderator): okay, thank you for sharing that. That is helpful feedback. So we're going to get on to another webpage here.

223
00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:18.250
P9: Okay.

224
00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:21.840
Katelyn (Moderator): so we'll need to get back into the zoom chat.

225
00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:25.389
P9: Well, let's see if I can do it. hey? I'm back all right.

228
00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:46.660
Katelyn (Moderator):  actually sorry about this. For a technical reason. Could you go back to your browser window and safari and open a new tab.

229
00:23:47.250 --> 00:23:48.840
P9: sure. and then proceed to Va, gov, okay, va. okay?

233
00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:06.490
Katelyn (Moderator): And then from here you could perfect from here if you could sign in up at the top. There's a sign in Link, and just use the credentials that you normally would on the site.

237
00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:23.929
P9: Well, just a second. I'm just scrolling down here once. Okay. okay, I'm gonna click on the sign in. Okay. okay. you're ready. Now I'm gonna click on my health. That definitely. Lp, vet. the only way I can get in

243
00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:52.359
Katelyn (Moderator): have you tried other ways and they haven't worked for you.

244
00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:53.780
P9: Yes. and this is overly complicated, in my opinion. But

247
00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:11.349
Katelyn (Moderator): you are not the first participant to share that.

248
00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:18.010
P9: Okay, let's show this password. Yeah, sure. Okay, let's see if I get in. I've been frustrated with these pages, and I don't always get in. Looks like I might to day.

253
00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:53.109
Katelyn (Moderator): Oh, yeah, look like it's working.

254
00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:01.590
P9: Okay.

255
00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:12.650
Katelyn (Moderator): here I am. Okay, perfect. Thank you so much for that. So now we will go back to the Zoom chat and open up that second link that I shared with you.

256
00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:14.610
P9: Okay. now, where would that second link be?

258
00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:23.890
Katelyn (Moderator): You see that more button up at the top?

259
00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:25.610
P9: The what?

260
00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:29.590
Katelyn (Moderator): The so back to the toolbar. There's mute, stop video, stop, share participants, and then more. If you can click into more. And then there's the chat and then open that chat window.

263
00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:41.730
P9: Okay? Alright. Okay. Okay. You want me to click on that

265
00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:48.310
Katelyn (Moderator): second link. Yes, the second link perfect.

266
00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:52.240
P9: Sorry I'm not so. Video. Savvy?

267
00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:57.210
Katelyn (Moderator): No, you're doing amazing. This is a lot of screen management.

268
00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:01.610
P9: Okay, we're at the right place. I'll have another drink to that. Okay. ice water.

272
00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:18.399
Katelyn (Moderator): All right.

273
00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:20.030
let's see here.

274
00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:28.889
Katelyn (Moderator): So we previously looked at a mock up of the website. But now we're looking at the actual website. and you've arrived at this page to start filling out this form. you could take a few minutes to review this page and explain what the content on this page means to you. And then what you would do next.

277
00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:02.890
P9: Okay, I've kind of just

278
00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:05.999
quickly looked it over.

279
00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:07.990
And

280
00:28:08.290 --> 00:28:10.449
P9: my first question is. why would I bother filling this information out. Okay, so the the walk? It's not mandatory, miss. Huh?

284
00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:29.930
Katelyn (Moderator): The the why behind this is another question you have.

285
00:28:29.970 --> 00:28:36.099
P9: But let's say, if there's a change in my circumstances like my. I changed my marital status or something. Let's say So the reason I'd want to go in here because there was a change in something  Okay. next. okay, and so, okay, sorry, keep going. well, you know, i'm, just going to say that for me, particularly. I'm retired. And I'm not seeking employment. So there's probably nothing in my life that's gonna change except marital status. My income is steady.

294
00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:38.940
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay? So for you, that would be the the only reason to fill out this if there was a change in merit.

296
00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:53.800
P9: and if I'd be a younger person that would be employed. That would be different if I was in my forties compared to my 70 s. So that's why I'm less likely to probably fill out this form. But anyway. just saying.

301
00:30:09.170 --> 00:30:10.030
okay.

302
00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:17.860
Katelyn (Moderator): anything. Jumping out at you as the most important information on this page before you start that form.

303
00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:32.429
P9:  nothing all. But it just makes me laugh that the Va is using an easy form like the Irs.

305
00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:40.780
Katelyn (Moderator): Yeah. it is interesting. On a scale of one to 5, with one being very poorly again and 5 being very well. How prepared does this page make you feel about the form you're about to begin?

307
00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:59.710
P9: I'm going to preface it with. It doesn't say mandatory on here, anywhere. And I'm just gonna stick with the 3

309
00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:16.660
Katelyn (Moderator): middle of the road again.

310
00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:18.760
P9: Sure, yeah.

311
00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:21.450
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay. do you have any suggestions or feedback for improving this stage or this process.

313
00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:47.780
P9: there's no compelling reason to fill it out. What would compel somebody to want to update this. I mean, say, I was 50 years old, and I went out and got a job. What compelling reason would I have to think that perhaps my prescription cost would go up if I told you I had a job.

317
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.269
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay, so for you, having that compelling reason to fill out this form would be the only way to really improve it for you.

319
00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:40.349
P9: under penalty, penalty of law mandatory under penalty, penalty of law. You must fill out this form that would kind of encourage me.

321
00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:45.769
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay, thank you for that. Okay, so for our next task, we're actually going to have you go through the form as if you were prompted to update your information. And this is a special Beta version of the form. Let's be careful not to submit. Your information, since we're still testing the form and its features. And as you go through the form. please use real information as if you're filling out the form.

327
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.970
P9: Okay, there's a few

328
00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:25.040
Katelyn (Moderator): few options for where if you are having trouble, can prompt you with something to input. But okay, we can get started.

331
00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:32.649
P9: Okay, I'm gonna accept. I'm gonna click on, start your health benefits update form. even though there's no penalty of law for not doing this. Maybe there should be. Oh. first thing I have to say, I see step one of 4, and that makes me happy that there's only 4 steps and not 15.

336
00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:02.620
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay.

337
00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:05.789
P9: 4 is a good number.

338
00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:08.460
What is a good number?

339
00:34:09.239 --> 00:34:17.960
P9: And I'm going to see that right away. My information is correct. And I know I'm just gonna click on to continue. Okay.

340
00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:19.969
Katelyn (Moderator): okay? And for that information that was supplies supplied. What are your expectations around that pre-filling information?

342
00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:41.230
P9: Well, the pre filling that they already know, or that the information is there. I'm happy. Let's type in

343
00:34:42.719 --> 00:34:43.840
Katelyn (Moderator): good to hear.

344
00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:52.020
P9: Continue on here. I'm I'm now onto my mailing address, which is absolutely correct. So I'm gonna hit. Continue again, because, hey, number one and number 2 have been very easy. All I had to do is click. Okay. And now I'm on number 300, wait a second step, one of 4, but I'm must still be on just step one. Hmm. Well, this had taken me down a rabbit hole. Okay? But once again, all I have to do is click, because, yeah, all the information on here is absolutely correct. So I'm gonna continue on. Oh, finally, I made it to step 2. Click, click, click, step 2. Okay, and now oh, this is easy, cause I can click, cause it's correct. And oh, now, I want some information. Do you want me to fake? Type it out?

351
00:35:45.730 --> 00:35:51.819
Katelyn (Moderator): Yeah, we could use real information wherever you have it and anything.

352
00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:55.640
P9: All right. Okay? Oh, now. that's problem. I'd have to do some research on that. I do not know that information.

355
00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:15.910
Katelyn (Moderator): It's alright for that one. We can do a fake number. But if you could make it look real, so, scrambling up the digits.

356
00:36:23.530 --> 00:36:25.850
P9: let me put the dashes in there. Okay. and I'll I could. Let's get that And I have to say I'm glad they just have it where you type it in instead of spinning the dial, because when you're born in the fifties, you have to do a lot of spinning. So tyking is saving you some time there for older people. It works better. Okay? Alright. So that was an easy thing. Okay? And I'm glad I like seeing that your information has been saved. So that's great. Okay? And now where I clicked or okay, I'm here to additional information. Oh, well, boy, it sounds more like an Irs form now. but I'll fill it out because it's only 2 clicks. hmm. hmm. Well, that's pretty black and white. Okay, I don't know. Let's see. We'll just okay. And net income from farm. What the hell! Wait a second. Oh, gross net! Oh, I. And for this I'd have to return to my refer to my income tax forms for numbers. Oh, we'll just say. And you know these numbers are far, far, far off. So really, I'd have to ref for So now, I'm gonna have to put a 0 in here for no additional income.

378
00:39:06.650 --> 00:39:09.189
Katelyn (Moderator): Yeah, for those income forms. How long would you say that would take you to hunt down that information

380
00:39:19.310 --> 00:39:21.809
P9: a half an hour to an hour?

381
00:39:22.590 --> 00:39:23.530
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay.

382
00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:27.329
P9: you know you'd have to find it in the filing cabinet.

383
00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:35.430
Katelyn (Moderator): Yep. okay, go ahead and continue. Yep.

384
00:39:37.170 --> 00:39:38.540
P9: Oh. and my husband and I keep our finance is pretty separate, so I don't know how I'd be answering this one and net income. So this is your gross income. So they didn't ask Gross from both. It was gross individually. And now let's say. but like, I say. I would have had to look this up

390
00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:25.360
Katelyn (Moderator): for the spouse information as well.

391
00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:28.740
P9: Yeah. definitely. let me other income that'd be big 0. Now. what about? So I have like an Ira. And when I'm 73 and a half, I'm going have to start taking minimum distributions. Was that on there.

395
00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:01.129
Katelyn (Moderator): Yeah, how would you go about verifying that?

396
00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:12.339
P9: Because I'm looking forward to being 73 and a half and tapping into my Ira. so that would the income so maybe that would be on my tax form at the end of the year. So I couldn't report it to the next year. Oh, now, this is interesting. I've already clicked on ahead. Is that okay? That's totally fine. Okay. okay, a non reimbursable medical expenses. Oh, I've spent a lot of money on that. yeah, for this one. Is this something that you track?

405
00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:09.200
Katelyn (Moderator): Usually?

406
00:42:09.970 --> 00:42:13.439
P9: No, I don't track it because can't do anything about it. So I'm just gonna type in a kind of a number. Okay. about 5,000. And for educational. that'd be a big 0. well, I'll just put a big 0 in there for that. Okay, so I'm kind of done with that page. And yeah, how did this page go?

415
00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:00.370
Did it make sense to you?

416
00:43:00.590 --> 00:43:04.169
P9: It made sense to me, because actually. I think I'm gonna keep better track of my non reimbursable medical expenses, because I've had this year more than what I would average have.

420
00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:23.460
I see.

421
00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:25.500
P9: But okay, other than that. that wasn't too bad. I'm going to click on to the next page I was imagining it's only 4 clicks, but it's and it asked me if I'm eligible for medic aid. No, so that's pretty easy there. So hit continue. and that is correct. I am on Medicare. and I'm going to click. Yes to that. Oh, okay, I'm excited. Step 3 of 4 insurance information. and I don't have any other insurance, so I can just click no and move on. But I did read it. just stop here. Yes.

434
00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:47.940
Katelyn (Moderator): we're on the review page now. so for making sure, we don't submit anything if you could scroll down to the bottom here. and then do you see that link that says, finish this form later above the back button.

438
00:45:07.370 --> 00:45:08.740
P9: and yes.

440
00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:15.240
Katelyn (Moderator): perfect. If you could click that for me.

441
00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:17.660
P9: Done.

442
00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:25.269
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay? And then from here we're gonna click that button that says, start a new form. It's going to clear out all the information you just entered.

444
00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:35.330
P9: Okay? So oh, okay, I see it start a new form. Okay? Starting over. Okay. are you sure you want to start over? There's no yes, to click on.

448
00:45:52.510 --> 00:46:12.979
Katelyn (Moderator): That's interesting. This looks like a bug. Now. Okay, here we go. Yes, exactly. And you can close out of this window now, and stop sharing

449
00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:14.330
from zoom

450
00:46:14.570 --> 00:46:18.870
P9: well, okay. And that is back up at the top and says, that

452
00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:25.520
drop share button.

453
00:46:25.570 --> 00:46:26.690
P9: Okay? And next.

455
00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:40.100
so back up at that.

456
00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:41.680
Katelyn (Moderator): Yes.

457
00:46:42.170 --> 00:46:46.070
P9: that toolbar on the top right of your zoom window.

458
00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:54.120
Katelyn (Moderator): You can click, stop, share in the middle of the big red text. And XI did. I did click that.

459
00:46:55.060 --> 00:47:01.420
Katelyn (Moderator): Okay, I still see your screen. But maybe it's just a bit delayed and stopping the share.

460
00:47:02.690 --> 00:47:08.840
P9: Oh, I see what you're saying. How do we get rid of that green? I don't know. Well.

462
00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:21.179
Katelyn (Moderator): we're just about done so. It's okay. If we hang out on this screen while we wrap up here.

463
00:47:21.310 --> 00:47:22.500
P9: Okay. sorry about that. I wanted to ask.

465
00:47:25.830 --> 00:47:32.750
Katelyn (Moderator): Well, no worries wanted to ask if there's anything else you'd like to add about what we talked about to day.

466
00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:41.539
P9: No, it's just a little curious that they copied the irs on the ez forms

467
00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:45.360
Katelyn (Moderator): standing out to you

468
00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:47.390
P9: that stands out to me.

469
00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:49.660
Okay?

470
00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:52.920
Katelyn (Moderator): And then any questions for me.

471
00:47:53.730 --> 00:47:54.500
Something.

472
00:47:56.020 --> 00:48:00.799
P9: No, I'm kind of sorry we didn't get to talk about the VA website in general.

474
00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:10.749
Katelyn (Moderator): is there something there's something you wanted to share there.

475
00:48:11.210 --> 00:48:12.910
P9: you know. the VA. Uses, a secure email system that I I guess some people need that. But for me. just a regular email is good enough for me. But you know the VA has a secure email system. so any information that gets sent to you you have to go through all those steps of logging on in order to get the email

482
00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:51.800
Katelyn (Moderator): right?

483
00:48:52.290 --> 00:48:57.120
P9: It secure messages. Yeah, I find it annoying.

484
00:48:58.100 --> 00:49:02.009
Katelyn (Moderator): I see. Okay, thank you for sharing that. That's good feedback.

485
00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:20.560
P9: But once again, anything, yeah, maybe somebody in other circumstances that might be the best way they can do it. Maybe they don't own a computer, and they have to go to a library or something to get their information. I guess I can understand it.

486
00:49:21.230 --> 00:49:23.860
Katelyn (Moderator):  okay. so, I want to circle back from our earlier conversation and reconfirm that you're comfortable. If we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners

489
00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:41.310
P9: sure. uncomfortable.

490
00:49:42.270 --> 00:49:43.190
Okay?

491
00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:48.419
Katelyn (Moderator): And is there any part of our discussion. You would not want shared in a video clip.

492
00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:50.500
P9: Nothing.

493
00:49:51.890 --> 00:49:52.700
Okay?

494
00:49:53.130 --> 00:49:58.640
Katelyn (Moderator): Well, we really appreciate you taking the time today and sharing your thoughts with us. Your feedback is super helpful to us as we continue working on va.gov, and making sure it really works for veterans like you. So thank you and Regina. We'll send you a thank you. Note as well with a blurb. If you want to pass that along to any other veterans, you know that Might want to participate in future studies. But other than that, thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day. Okay, thanks again.

500
00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:32.250
P9: Sorry I wasn't a little more computer. Savvy?

501
00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:37.360
Katelyn (Moderator): Nice? Thank you again. Thank you very much. Bye.
