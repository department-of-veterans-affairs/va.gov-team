00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:16.639
Angela (Moderator): Got it. So we we really appreciate your time and want to make sure that we respect. You know your privacy and all of that. Okay? So I have started recording, and I'd like to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

2
00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:18.890
P4: I am comfortable with that. Yes.

3
00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:27.529
Angela (Moderator): okay. And are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from the discussion today, share with our Va partners and remove any information that could be used to identify you.

4
00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.259
P4: I agree with that completely.

5
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:43.070
Angela (Moderator): Okay, fantastic. Now, we can get into the meat of what we're talking about today? So a couple of questions before we take a look at anything on the website, do you have a service connected disability with the BA, I do.

6
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.819
P4: Okay? And what's your disability rating? 100 pnt.

7
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.290
Angela (Moderator): Okay, I am letting one person in from the waiting room.

8
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.900
P4: Sorry about that. No problem.

9
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.479
Angela (Moderator): When was the last time that you visited a Va medical facility?

10
00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:16.340
P4: Let me think so. I had my annual physical. I wanna say, it was in July. and I had a dental appointment, I think, in August. So that was pretty much it.

12
00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.759
Angela (Moderator): Okay, great

13
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:28.990
P4: Hi, Jesse, thanks for joining just put yourself on mute when you get a chance. Jesse and Cecilia are partners from the Va. Good Hi, Jesse!

14
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:41.720
Angela (Moderator): Alright! So couple of other questions. Can you share any past experiences that you've had updating your health benefits information with the Va.

15
00:01:41.960 --> 00:02:07.960
P4: So I'm not sure exactly what health benefits is. But is that like adding a spouse, or a child, or my address, or my bank account, or anything like that. Okay, yeah, I'm actually an it guy. And so I work with computers. So I have basically muddled my way through all of that stuff, you know somewhat of a learning curve. But I eventually got there.

16
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:10.500
Angela (Moderator): Okay? And how'd you go about doing that?

17
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.390
P4:  if I remember correctly? I submitted my first claim. I started. I want to say 2,015, submitted my first claim, and I've done all my claims myself online through E-benefits, which I think is now not as much more. It's transferring over to Vi. Gov for a lot of the functions. But it was a learning process getting into it. But once I kind of learned how the system worked and and what it did and information that I needed because I did other research. Read the regulations, the Cfrs and those types of things, II that helped me with some of my wording and stuff, and I got my medical records from St. Louis, or wherever they come from, and Once I got those, then I could saw things that I could use to submit claims for, and so once I connected all of that, I went in and filling out the forms is it's kind of a a fill in Pdf, I think the 5 26 form, or something like that. And I've probably submitted about 10 or 12 of those doing those types of things, and it seemed like most of the time, it was not too too difficult for me, but someone who didn't have it experience and working with you know, fillable Pd Pdfs and excel spreadsheets and word documents and things like that might have had a problem because I it was easy for me to get things and attach them and things like that. So II had to mail in very few things. And most of the things I did online.

29
00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.220
Angela (Moderator): Okay. on Ebenefits, you think. Yes, okay. alright. So imagine that you have been notified that you need to update your financial information in order to maintain your copay and healthcare benefits. How would you go about doing that?

32
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:19.779
P4: So I believe that that function is now in va.gov, and not in E-benefits anymore. But I have a sign in. I can sign into Va Gov. Through. Id me sends me a text code, and that after I send that. And I know that once I get into there I can click around looking for the right. The menus on the left side of things you want to do and find the right thing to update my account, I guess, I think, is what the banking is under, and then submit my new routing number and account number, I think.

39
00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.189
Angela (Moderator): Okay, thank you.

40
00:04:51.220 --> 00:05:05.270
P4: How would you like to be notified that you need to update information for your healthcare benefits. I'm unlike I'm 64. So I'm unlike a lot of younger people who do everything on their phone. My daughter actually filed her taxes on her phone one time. I'm like, How do you do that? And yeah. And so I actually, like, I prefer emails. I like working on the bigger screen. Having to keyboard those types of things. So email is the way to go with me. Gotcha. Okay.

43
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:39.830
Angela (Moderator): and then you kind of described how you would update that information online. And you, you think you'd go to Va, Gov, and you'd navigate around using the main navigation. It sounded like correct. okay.

45
00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:47.930
P4: great. Alright. So we're ready to take a look at some web pages together.

46
00:05:48.050 --> 00:06:05.379
Angela (Moderator): you will be interacting with a beta version of the website today. First, I'm going to share a link with you. That's on our staging site, and then we're gonna log into your real account. And we turned on this new form just for your account. So it's not live yet.Therefore it may not function exactly the way you expect. It is you know, still in progress. And when you log into your account it's linked to the Va system. So we'll show your real information. Therefore, towards the end of that form, I'm gonna remind you not to submit anything because it would actually go somewhere if you did. So. When we get to the end of the form, I'll remind you not to submit the form. and I'll instruct you how we can erase that information that we entered.
So for another scenario, imagine that you just started a new job, and your health insurance has changed because of that. So now you've realized that you need to update your insurance details for your Va healthcare benefits to do that, you decided to go search on Google to find out how and where you could update that information. And Google takes you to this page on Va. Gov, that I'm going to share you link to Once I get you that link. Are you comfortable with sharing your screen and talking me through your thought process?
Okay, before you do that, please be sure to close any personal information like email, Facebook, etc. And I am going to paste the link in the zoom chat. Let me know if you have any trouble finding it.

54
00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:31.460
P4: Okay. So once you have that link up on your screen, then you can share your screen with me, and let me know if you need any help doing that I'm sharing. Can you see it? I see it? Thank you so much. Awesome. Alright. So let's take a look at this page. You can feel free to read through it, scan through it

58
00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:12.750
Angela (Moderator):  and then please explain to me what the content on this page means to you, and what you would naturally do next if you came to this page.

59
00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:17.200
P4: Well, the first thing I do is sign in. But it looks like it's pretty self explanatory of how to update my health benefit information, personal financial insurance information. After I've enrolled in va healthcare which I am enrolled in. So then it says, How do I update? I sign in? Should I do it, or just talk about it.

63
00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:42.399
Angela (Moderator): Let's just keep, you know, going through. So it gives me

64
00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:45.790
P4: phone number I could use, or to do it by mail and I'm a fan of emails and doing things online with a computer, not a phone and so I would want to. I actually have updated mine at the health facility here. Because I did do that, I changed jobs. And I had to update my insurance information. And I actually did it at the VA. Because I think back then 2,016 or 17, or something like that. It was more difficult to try to get this accomplished on line. So yeah, I ended up going there and doing that

70
00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:27.179
Angela (Moderator): definitely was, yeah.

71
00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:39.290
P4: I wonder if the dependent information actually really works? Why do you say that. My. a personal example. So my daughter is special needs, and she she receives SSI, and I had her as a dependent on my compensation, and it messed up the social security. Ssi payments to to the extent where we just said we're just gonna take her off of there. The net was that I was receiving
$106 a month for her and the way the SSI sees it, since since she's receiving money for Va. Compensation that's counted as income rele relevant to her SSI. And so they deduct $20 from that, making it $86, and then they take that 86, and deduct it from her payment each month. So we were fine with that, because it was a net gain for us of of $20 versus what she would have got, and
And then, after about a year, they sent us a thing and said, Oh, this is messed up, and this is mess up, and they started deducting more money out of it, and they couldn't get it straight. So my wife and I decided that we would just remove her as a dependent, so that the SSI money would just be free and clear, because we have to. A lot of reporting involved with that with Medicare and the courts in Nebraska and Social Security Department. And so we just didn't want any messes going on with that, and then trying to change her coverage or something like that. So I submitted 2 or 3 different claims to try to get her removed. and it never worked, and I ended up having to write a letter and mail it to the place in Wisconsin, and they finally removed her from it, and then, after we got her removed. social security kept deducting it, and they would not acknowledged that she was no longer receiving VA healthcare, a VA compensation, and she should have been receiving your her full SSI and we had a contacting. The Social Security Cart Department is nearly impossible. And so we. Finally my wife finally got a hold of them, and we had to submit documents to them. showing that she was actually stopped receiving compensation in early 2020, 2021, and then they gave us all the back pay. Things have finally worked out, but it took us 2 or 3 years to get that done. It's messy.
Honestly, it is. It is with social security, I think. They're removing a dependent, I think, is something that probably doesn't happen that often. Because if a if you have a dependent who's a college age student and they're 18 and they they turn 18 and they start college. You submitted a document saying, My daughter's in college because my other daughter did. We went through this. You submit a document, and they leave her on there and then. either when she graduates college or she turns 23, I think they automatically remove her, and if you have dependents that are under 18 when they turn 18 they're automatically removed. But I don't think people actually go in and say, Hey, remove my dependent. And I think that because of that there was no so no block to say, remove this dependent. It was just updating a dependent. and I would write in the notes section. Please remove this blah blah blah, and it never works. So I finally mailed with the cover letter and they read the cover letter and finally removed her.

100
00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:24.989
Angela (Moderator): Yeah, I've heard, social security is really difficult. So, reading this, would you think you'd be able to update your daughter's dependency on this form? Well, it says right here, it says dependent information. So in theory, I can update my dependent information on there.

103
00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.670
P4: For instance, I think that I think that if I have a a dependent who is 21 and is in college, and they get married. I think they're no longer dependent. And so if I could update that and say, this dependent got married. then they would remove it. But just just go in there and say, Hey, please remove this one. I don't know. Maybe that's something that's seen so infrequently that they don't have a special thing for that.

107
00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:05.270
Angela (Moderator): Okay. alright. So let's keep looking through this page a little bit more. That's that's really helpful. And I know that updating dependents for Va benefits is a pain point for veterans. The Va. Is aware of that and are making updates to the website to make it easier to do that online, at least for your Va, thanks to security.

109
00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:36.599
P4: that's a whole nother issue. Okay, so can I use this form to find out if my health benefits will change. That's good uses to apply for VA healthcare. No, this is a different thing. So. but but if you're looking for that, it gives you this link here, so you can click on it to apply. I actually know the answer to this one about the other insurance, because I actually had conversations with people at my local Va and I understand it now. And like I said, I'm 64. So I'm turning 65 in March, which is my Medicare filing age. So I've been doing a lot of research into that. So do I need Medicare? Do I not need Medicare in my mind? Because I'm a hundred percent? I have credible health coverage. I shouldn't need medicare. But what I found out is that my Va 100% medical care coverage. it's not counted as credible coverage as far as Medica care is concerned, so I still have to get Medicare. So then my question is, is that, do I need to get Medicare, A or Medicare A and B, and because it's not credible coverage, I need to get Medicare B, also, which costs me money out of pocket. A $164 a month is what it is currently, and I'm sure that it's going to go up January first. So but I understand the reasoning behind this. But that's a good explanation of of how that stuff works. What if I need help updating my information? I can call. And I found a lot of people complain about this, but I found that if I call the number. and I called them at 10 Am. On a Tuesday morning or 2 2 in the afternoon or Wednesday. I don't have to wait too long. I'm not on hold for an hour, and most of the people I speak with are pretty helpful. So making phone calls is good. Often in a phone call, they'll be like, Oh, you have to send us this document, this document, this document. But they give you an address of what you need to send. So I had to do that when I added, my wife and my kids cause I had to send marriage certificate, birth certificates and things like that. So yeah.

130
00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:54.980
Angela (Moderator): gotcha. alright. So now that you've gone through this page, I'm curious. If you could give this page a rating of one to 5 on how prepared it made you feel about the form? If you were to, you know, really begin updating this. One being very poorly prepared. 5. Being very well prepared. What would you rate it?

132
00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:37.110
P4: I think it. It gives us basic information. It tells us.  if I'm looking to update my health care or my insurance, it has this question, if I'm looking to apply it, has this question. So.
assuming that this form is what I want to do, it's very well prepared. If I'm looking for something else, then it's like. Oh, I need to go and go somewhere else. So

135
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:50.770
okay.

136
00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:55.330
P4: you know, if you give people every possible scenario potential question they have. Then the the form gets too jumbled up. So I'm gonna get rated a 5 cause I think it's very helpful. It's very clear it's concise. It gives you options. When you know, learn more about this. Find out how It tells you the categories of information that can be updated right in this group right here. Find your local facility. If you want to go and see them where to mail it, if you want to mail it, and how to call, if you want to call, or I'll go up or do it online sign in and do it. So yeah, this is a, this is a great page. I think it's very good.

143
00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:42.470
Angela (Moderator): Okay. Any suggestions or feedback that would make this page better and make you feel more prepared to do the healthcare benefits Update form.

145
00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:58.110
P4:  I think it's good. I'm sure that once you like. If if this says, find out how, and I click on it. And I go to this link, it's gonna tell me what forms or things II might need for that. So I think this is a good jumping off point to get to get these things done. Okay, I don't have any other feedback for

148
00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:30.859
Angela (Moderator): alright. Thank you. Alright. So we are done with this page. Now, I'm gonna have you open a new tab and go to Va. Gov, and sign in the way that you normally would with id me. I think you mentioned

149
00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:38.690
P4: Hi. DM, me. so there, it's got my email and password already filled. So I can sign into that. And then it. I always ask for the text on that because my phone is in my hands. So and I got a number. I'm in Charles at the top.

153
00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:24.940
Angela (Moderator): Great. Okay. So now I'm going to post a link in the zoom chat again, and since you're logged in, it should, if you go to that link, you should be logged in to be at helpful. Let's see what it does.

155
00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:49.810
P4:  Oh, there we go. Okay.

156
00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:07.430
Angela (Moderator): okay, let's click the link in the chat again. Oh, did I not get the right run. No, II think you did it right, but you might have to do it again. I've seen it take people back to the homepage before. and let's click it again. It's like you back to the Homepage Exchange. Maybe. Let's close all these tabs. Open a new one and click the link that I sent you in the chat hopefully, or still be logged in since you. It gives you like 15 min or so.

163
00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:56.859
P4: Okay, so close everything except the one I'm logged in on.

164
00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:02.310
Angela (Moderator): You can close everything and then open a new tab.

165
00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:04.639
Angela (Moderator): then click the link. and I can't see your screen anymore to see. I close, I close the whole stop sharing. Okay.

167
00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:14.180
P4: alright. So sorry for the difficulty. No, no, it's okay.

169
00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:31.020
Angela (Moderator): So I just clicked on that one, and it gave me sign in again anymore. Okay, sorry. I think it's okay. Sign in again. Alright. Let's try the link in the chat

171
00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:07.230
P4: one more time. Huh?

172
00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:08.200
Okay?

173
00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:16.170
Angela (Moderator): Nope did that again.

174
00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:25.429
P4: You had like Googled it, I think, before. And I saw it come up in search results. Yeah, what I did was I copied the the link.

175
00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:29.900
Angela (Moderator): and I went up here and I pasted it in there.

176
00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:32.559
P4: So try that

177
00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:35.790
Angela (Moderator): now. Oh, now, that didn't work. Yeah, before it took you to Google. maybe because you were signed out.

180
00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:50.030
P4: Maybe that's did that. So I'll I'll click on this Bing search one to see. Okay. So you want me to click on one of those

181
00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:51.730
Angela (Moderator): click on that top link.

182
00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:52.600
P4: Okay.

183
00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:58.320
Angela (Moderator): hmm. redirected you again.

184
00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:00.780
P4: That is so weird.

185
00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:08.869
Angela (Moderator): Yeah. Cause the only thing I could think of is copy and paste the link instead of clicking it.

186
00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:14.069
P4: Yeah, which is what I did a couple of times.

187
00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:15.850
Angela (Moderator): You did.

188
00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:19.540
P4: Do you want me to try to find that

189
00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:30.349
Angela (Moderator): like, search for it, or let's try. I'm not sure if it will come up. Let's try. Let's try the search. and you can try searching. Ecr. See if it comes up doing that. I don't think I don't think it's in there now. and just keep keep trying clicking the link, I would say, cause I've seen this happen. Oh. yeah, let's try that link.

196
00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:04.160
P4: Okay.

197
00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:07.380
Angela (Moderator): yeah. It looked like it. Think so. Yes.

199
00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:12.670
P4: alright. that was work. Yeah, I'm so sorry you figured it out before I did.

201
00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:46.640
Angela (Moderator): Yeah, I'm sure you'll have some really good feedback for us. Okay, so. Let's take a look at this page and same thing that we did with the other one. Let me know what the content means to you summarize. You know any any important information that's standing out to you here and tell me how prepared you feel to start the form based on what you're seeing on this page.

202
00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:31.960
P4: So from reading this, it sounds like I have to download the form and mail it. I can't submit it online.

204
00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:38.350
Angela (Moderator): Okay.

205
00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:40.910
P4: is that correct?

206
00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:42.670
Angela (Moderator): What it? What

207
00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:46.750
P4: content specifically is making you think that? How do I use this form?

209
00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:53.740
Angela (Moderator): Yeah. I just actually don't think this is the right page. Scroll down a little bit. because, yeah, you're seeing like the existing page which right now you can only update it out of the paper form. But we are trying to test the digital one. So yeah, unfortunately, we haven't gotten to the right link.

213
00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:19.229
P4: Okay, should I go back to the link and click it again.

214
00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:24.780
Angela (Moderator): Yeah, let's try this one. So I'm still signed in here. Okay.

216
00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:27.710
P4: go to chat. Still coming up. packed back. And your benefits.

218
00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:39.629
Angela (Moderator): Yeah, it's sticking to the home page. Okay. if we can't get this to work, I do have a fake user that we can use.

221
00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:07.949
P4: So so was the page we were looking at before. Was that the one that's actual on? Va, Gov, yeah, that's the page that's already live.

223
00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:20.479
Angela (Moderator): I think that we're we might. I think we're having some issues with the online version. So I may have to just use a fake account. And I'll just share my screen with you and get your feedback about the form. No, don't be sorry. I am so sorry. You've really been patient with all the technical difficulty. And

227
00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:49.729
P4: I develop software. So II know how it goes. Yeah, testing is the testing environment can really be challenging

228
00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:54.400
Angela (Moderator): alright. So you can stop sharing. And I'm gonna get the the fake account, the saving account set up, and I'm gonna share my screen one moment. Where are you located? I'm located just outside of Philadelphia. What about you?

238
00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:24.699
Angela (Moderator): They always give us a run for our money, though, whenever we match up. I think they beat us last year I'm in Texas. So guess what team. I'm for

239
00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:40.500
Cecilia Doporto: stinking cowboys. My brother roots for him, too. He drives us crazy. We all grew up there right outside of DC. And he is a cowboy Fan, we're all watching fans

240
00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:47.579
P4: Kansas here. So go, chief. Oh, yeah, I really like my home. I think he's just awesome.

241
00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:52.499
P4: And Taylor Swift has added a whole nother dimension to football. She got a whole bunch of people who aren't football fans coming out to root for football

243
00:30:57.250 --> 00:30:59.279
Cecilia Doporto: and Mahomes is from Texas.

244
00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:01.779

Note Taker: Chargers.

00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:09.880
P4: hackers. tigers! Oh, tigers.

00:31:22.530 --> 00:31:24.250
P4: chargers! I just got it.

250
00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:31.599
Cecilia Doporto: I wanted to annoy my husband, so when I had a layover in Vegas I bought a raider shirt.

251
00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:33.959
P4: Oh, my, gosh.

252
00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:37.240
Angela (Moderator): hmm! Hmm! Alright! Trying to get to the form and staging here we're gonna who's so we're starting a new form. And this so this is a fake account. Unfortunately, we're not gonna see your real information. It's gonna be Mark tucks, polar bear. Sorry. I like, I like being part of the development process. So I'm just gonna click us through here. But mostly we wanna get feedback from you about the form itself, so you can still take a look. Just let me know if you need me to like Zoom in any further or anything like that.

255
00:32:13.910 --> 00:32:14.940
P4: Okay.

256
00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:21.510
Angela (Moderator): okay. So taking a look at this page, sec, just take a few minutes to look at the content of this page, and could you let me know how how prepared you feel at this point? One to 5. To go and hit, continue from this page.

260
00:32:40.570 --> 00:32:47.960
P4: So this is an update form to update health benefits information. And this is what they're showing for me now. that makes a lot of sense. I like that. So security numbers kind of blocked out just in case. And I can make a call if I want to. I can go to my health facility, my nearest Va, or I can continue so. Makes sense. I like it. I would, con. I would click, continue easily, feel confident.  5.

266
00:33:11.970 --> 00:33:26.609
Angela (Moderator): Alright. Alright. So I'm going to continue so now we're gonna have you go through the form as if you were prompted to update your information. And remember, this is just a beta version of the form and let's say it was provided to you via email. You came here to update your information. Now, we don't have to worry about you accidentally submitting anything, so I won't remind you that  So please feel free to talk out loud. As you're reviewing the form.

269
00:33:49.240 --> 00:34:00.560
P4:  I don't know. I don't know that I'd receive a general email of just update your form, or you need to Update your such and such thing, or what I would need to do. But I would like I do for other things, banks and other accounts. I would kinda scroll down and check the information. Double check it. Make sure that it is correct in my current information. and if not, I would change it like, if I'd moved, I would change my address.  okay.

275
00:34:29.130 --> 00:34:33.480
Angela (Moderator): what are your expectations around pre-filling information?

276
00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:37.730
P4: I like prefilled information. It saves you from typing a bunch of stuff. But if I had actually moved I would know that as I went through my accounts I'd have to update them. And this would be part of the process. So I like seeing pre-filled because it it makes it easier for you.

281
00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:57.400
Angela (Moderator): Okay. Gotcha. you feel ready, would you then go on to the next step yet?

283
00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:06.940
P4:  yes. yeah. I think I'm good.

285
00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:09.750
Angela (Moderator): Okay. alright. Let's take a look at this information. Looks the same to me. Let's see if we okay. Sorry. I don't know. I didn't take me to the next page, but now we're there.

289
00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:26.359
P4: Alright. Let's take a look at this one. So phone and email address. cause, phones do sometimes change email addresses change. I would actually fill in the mobile phone number. I'm like a lot of people. I don't have a landline phone anymore. So I will change it. 703 is a Virginia area code too

294
00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:49.060
Angela (Moderator): nice?

295
00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:51.620
P4: Not New Zealand?

296
00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:55.949
Angela (Moderator): Yeah. Nope, Nope, Nope.

297
00:35:57.430 --> 00:36:04.089
P4: yeah. So if I if I had to update any of that, I would update it if it was correct, I would just click, continue.

298
00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:06.170
Angela (Moderator): Okay?

299
00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:25.570
P4: So I would click on the select because I'm married and change that. Okay, and then click, continue. I like that. It says it would save for me down there as I made a change.

301
00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:36.740
Angela (Moderator): Okay?

302
00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:44.599
P4: Oh, good. I get to add my spouse. So when I did this before I had to mail it in. So this is really nice.

304
00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:51.069
Angela (Moderator): Yeah, it is still that way, but very won't be.

305
00:36:51.360 --> 00:37:01.099
P4: But hopefully you. You're fixin it, Angela, you, you and the crew. Okay? So I would type in the information as required here. Okay, select the birth date date of the marriage. double check it that I did it right? And then I would continue.

310
00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:18.660
Angela (Moderator): okay. just gonna enter, quote information. Here are, yeah, that's good.

312
00:37:27.090 --> 00:37:29.329
P4: Okay, nothing here.

313
00:37:29.590 --> 00:37:31.540
Angela (Moderator): Surprising. Did I miss a number.

315
00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:51.190
P4: Yeah.

316
00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:52.590
but

317
00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:56.109
P4: also your dates are kind of off. I bet they are 10 year olds don't get married too often. I'm just having fun. Sorry.

320
00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:12.159
Angela (Moderator): Okay, so nothing surprising. Here. You just fill out the information. Okay. continue.

322
00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:22.859
P4: I also like to finish this form later of link that you have on there, so it'll save it. So you can come back to it.

323
00:38:23.110 --> 00:38:24.010
Angela (Moderator): Okay.

324
00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:26.600
P4: that's not always an option. So.

325
00:38:27.610 --> 00:38:28.480
Angela (Moderator): okay.

326
00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:38.970
P4: okay, so did you live for with your spouse. Yes. currently have the same address as your spouse. Yes. continue. do you have your dependency report? Who do we consider a dependent? So I actually know that. But it's nice that that little drop down there is. You can click on for who we consider dependent spouse or unmarried child.They got to be under 18 or 18 to 23, if they're going to college or school. or a permanent disability. So I actually had both of those 2 things in mind when I enrolled my 2 daughters. So yeah. So I would click. Yes, to enroll them.

338
00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:26.660
Angela (Moderator): Okay.

339
00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:33.319
P4: So I believe this thing does one dependent at a time. and I actually had to get some information to send showing the disability of my handicapped daughter. But yeah, I would fill in the name and relationship, the social security number and the date of birth. And when did they become your dependents? So in my case also my wife and I second marriage for both of us. So all the kids are my step kids. So that was actually. when did they become your dependent bum was not their date of birth, but a different date. Gotcha, I guess that's why they ask, and so I would fill out all of that and then click on. Continue. So.

352
00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:30.440
Angela (Moderator): okay. just filling out some fake information. Here. daughter. 123-45-6789. I thought I did it right that time. Maybe it's because they know and not sure. Bill, let me maybe 4, 4, 4 is an invalid one. Okay.

362
00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:05.500
Angela (Moderator): see? I just don't want it to stop me from. And going forward this time I did really random numbers more of it. Okay.

366
00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:24.570
P4: the so additional information. So so if we're doing my disability one, then the first question would be, Yes. and I think that's actually important, because if they weren't. then they wouldn't qualify, or something like that if their disability was when as an adult. and then yes, for the live with you and no, for the income.

371
00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:52.900
Angela (Moderator): Okay.

372
00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:55.209
P4: and then continue. And then I had a second daughter. We can add, or we can go without. Okay. So again, fill in all the information there. Name, name. daughter. so security number! Oh, good! I did have name, too. They could. They could have the same name right? I guess they could. My wife's sister. His name is Shawn. My wife's sister's name's Shonda, and she named her daughter Shonda. which you see a lot of men, juniors, but I'm not used to seeing women. Junior. So yeah, my mom and grandma have the same name, too. And I'm like, I do not know why you guys did that for the third.

380
00:42:48.820 --> 00:43:00.469
Angela (Moderator):  yeah, that would have been weird.  I have a similar name to my dad. So anytime that anyone, said Ange. we are both answering alright. So so continue okay. So this one does not have a disability. They did live with me. And my daughter was working, and I think I put yes, for income and continue. But she's still on my taxes. II don't. I don't know that maybe there's an income threshold or something that they're not okay. So you might expect that. yeah, I don't remember the details of it.

390
00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:52.159
P4: I certainly don't want to fudge or lie on my forms, and I'm applying to the VA. Stuff. So you know, she was working summers while she was going to school and she worked as a barista during the school year. So we put yes for her income. It may not have affected it at all, I guess.

393
00:44:06.570 --> 00:44:07.440
Angela (Moderator): Okay. again.

395
00:44:13.070 --> 00:44:21.720
P4: So they asked for income. So I think her income was in the let's say, $8,000, and then 0 for farm property or business. and then 0 for other and income continue. Okay, how'd you feel about this page? Anything confusing or no, not to me. But I'm used to doing things like that and the farm property business. I know it's another category of income that for some reason the higher risk tracks, and so consequently the Va. Probably does, too, for some reason. But it's pretty clear. I figured when we said they had income, that we were gonna get asked something about it. So it makes sense.

403
00:45:06.650 --> 00:45:07.720
Angela (Moderator): Okay. Would it be difficult for you to get this information? Seemed like you kind of had it off the top of your head? Would you feel confident that it's accurate?

406
00:45:17.370 --> 00:45:22.410
P4: I think it's pretty close to accurate because I would do their taxes for them? The kids, when they were until they got to where they were comfortable to do it themselves also at the same time. If I had to do this and they had done their taxes the year before. I could have just sent them a text and said, Hey, I need your gross income from last year, and they would have gave it to me, I'm sure.

409
00:45:44.230 --> 00:45:45.060
Angela (Moderator): Okay.

410
00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:46.340
P4: yeah.

411
00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:49.170
Angela (Moderator): Chair. Did you feel prepared to have to enter this kind of information when you are on the intro page before we enter the form.

413
00:45:58.410 --> 00:46:02.479
P4:  only because I had already done it once before. So first part. yeah. You, you know, on the front page you. You don't want to make it too busy and have a million details of stuff you can do. The other thing is that as you're adding this form, it lets you save it at the bottom. I don't know if there's one at the bottom of this one but you know, to finish this later, or something like that. But

417
00:46:24.570 --> 00:46:25.460
Angela (Moderator): no.

418
00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:27.120
P4: I know it would. In the middle of this form it would probably save it like. am I gonna lose this, if I have to go and call my daughter and say, Hey, what was your gross income? And it takes her an hour to get back to me, would I lose this data? A on some of the other pages that had this auto saved thing at the bottom or finish this later. it doesn't actually have that on this one. But okay, what would you do if you texted your daughter? She can get back to you right away. You wanted to save it for later, what would you do from here? I would guesstimate an amount and and enter it. And then hopefully, somewhere later along the line I could, I could save it and come back to it later. Once I got the information and change the amount to the exact amount. Okay, so you would enter this. You're guessing you keep going. Okay. So right there, I could click, finish this form later. But since I'm done with the 2 of them, I would probably say. Do you have another dependent? I would say no. and then I would click, finish this form later. and that would allow me to come back at at to that form and say. Go to name 2 and edit it, and then fix her income.

435
00:47:56.070 --> 00:48:00.149
Angela (Moderator): Okay, how would you expect to be able to come back to this form later?

436
00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:09.920
P4:  I would search at the top for the wait a minute. Claims and progress is usually where I would go to find something that I had going on. So I don't know if this would come up in the claims in progress session, because once you submit things, I actually submitted a intent to file for the Pact act which you had to have. your intent to file filed by sometime in August, I think. in real life. And as I talked to more and more people they're like, why would you open up your file again? What if they go in there? And they reduce your rating from 100% down to 80. And so I'm gonna let that intent to file just expire because there's no sense messing with it sound like, I'm gonna get more disability. So okay, so you never submitted that intent to file. But then I never filed a claim. II don't know that I can actually delete it, but I know that it will expire in one year if I don't file a claim.

447
00:49:14.710 --> 00:49:15.490
Angela (Moderator): Okay?

448
00:49:15.870 --> 00:49:16.650
So

449
00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:25.540
Angela (Moderator): so if you were gonna try to come back to this form later, you'd go to Va. Gov and search for claims.

450
00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:28.160
P4: Yeah. I I'm much more familiar with e-benefits. But I know that every most everything's moved over, but they used to have a a bar on this a menu on menu on the left side that had claims in progress, and I would click on that and would open up, and if you had 2 claims in progress. They would both be there. You could click on either one. And so I'm assuming that somewhere in va.gov, there would be a claims and progress thing.

453
00:49:54.330 --> 00:50:08.250
Angela (Moderator): Gotcha. It's really helpful. Thank you. For the purposes of this, you know, just getting through the rest of the form. We're just gonna continue. Pretend that you did get in touch with your daughter. Verify that information, and we're going through the rest of the form. This is the next page.

455
00:50:13.450 --> 00:50:16.280
P4: Okay? So I have to put in my income.

456
00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:22.840
Angela (Moderator): Is that what you think it's asking? Enter my gross annual income from 2022.

457
00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:30.850
P4: So we can put 82,000.

459
00:50:34.780 --> 00:50:35.830
Angela (Moderator): Okay.

460
00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:39.140
P4: Net income. no farm pro or property or business 0. Okay. other income. So so click on the what do we consider other annual income. Soon, it says, retirement unemployment VA benefit compensation money from Saleh house interests from investments. So my Va compensation would be 42,000.

466
00:51:08.810 --> 00:51:11.169
Angela (Moderator): So then you'd just put that here

467
00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:12.700
P4: part week. Then you'd put 42,000 here. Nothing else. Yes, yeah, nothing else. There. Yeah.

469
00:51:19.230 --> 00:51:20.580
Angela (Moderator): alright.

470
00:51:21.170 --> 00:51:23.389
P4: Oh, good. With this page. Yes.

471
00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:27.210
Angela (Moderator): okay. Was anything confusing or surprising here?

472
00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:33.379
P4:  I'm surprised they're asking for my income at all. But then I'm remembering now that we're updating everything, so that that stuff is affected by. I think my my copays are affected by my income. my status being that I'm a hundred percent item, not sure it's gonna make any difference in the end. I'm just kind of thinking ahead. But yeah, so the the forms clear. It makes sense. I was surprised. They asked for. I'm not sure I ever been asked for my annual gross income before, but I might be wrong

478
00:52:03.170 --> 00:52:09.180
Angela (Moderator): from the Va. In particular. Yes, Gotcha.

479
00:52:09.490 --> 00:52:13.749
P4: so okay, not that you're recalling. Okay.

480
00:52:15.010 --> 00:52:17.029
Angela (Moderator): anything else about this page?

481
00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:28.399
P4: No, I think I think it's good. And I had you open that thing up in the other income cause. I wasn't sure if va benefit compensation was included or not, so it gave me the answer. So I'm good

482
00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:31.190
Angela (Moderator): gotcha. alright. We are getting a little closer time. Mainly because of those technical issues. I can go over a little bit. But I just wanted to ask if you have a hard stop at 11 Am. Eastern. Okay? I think we're pretty close to being done, so we'll wrap this up soon. Alright.

485
00:52:53.350 --> 00:53:00.469
P4: let's take a look at this page. Let me know your thoughts. 30,000 in the first box. 0 farm income and 0 other income.

489
00:53:12.670 --> 00:53:13.600
Angela (Moderator): Okay.

490
00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:18.879
P4: we're good. Anything surprising or confusing on the stage. No.

491
00:53:19.470 --> 00:53:20.320
Angela (Moderator): okay.

492
00:53:22.650 --> 00:53:26.710
P4: actually, I actually am surprised that they asked for her income. But. you know that maybe they're just building more or database, or I don't remember ever being asked that before. So

495
00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:39.160
Angela (Moderator): okay, would you have any hesitancy to provide that? I generally am not I figure that

497
00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:47.440
P4: it's always best to be open and honest. I mean, I'm I feel so thankful and completely blessed. The Va. Does what they do for me. So I'm gonna work within their system.

500
00:53:56.390 --> 00:53:58.750
Angela (Moderator): Okay, Gotcha. let's take a look at this page. Same thing

502
00:54:06.380 --> 00:54:09.380
P4: deductible unreversible medical expenses. Oh, my gosh, is that the 2% thing that the IRS. Does? Let's click on the what we consider nonreimbursable. Okay, cost you your spouse paper. These are health care for yourselves, your dependents, or others. You have the moral obligation to support doctors, medications, medicare, inpatient nursing home. We only consider expenses, nonreimbursable if your health insurance doesn't pay you back for the cost. so that would take me doing some calculations and going through records and figuring that out off the top of my head. I know that I have have a flex account for 2,400 and use the entire thing. So at the minimum be 2,400. But I'm sure that I had some more pocket out of pocket expenses. So I would say that, assuming I went through and totaled it all up. Let's say it's 3,000.

512
00:55:09.250 --> 00:55:17.820
Angela (Moderator): Okay. So if you're going through this form for real, would you go back and try to find that information, or would you estimate it at 3,000?

513
00:55:18.530 --> 00:55:20.920
P4: I would get the information.

514
00:55:21.420 --> 00:55:22.170
Angela (Moderator): Okay. because obviously, they're doing something with all this information.

516
00:55:25.330 --> 00:55:28.600
P4: And I want it to be right. II don't. Wanna I don't. Wanna certainly don't wanna commit fraud. But I definitely don't. Wanna you know, mislead them.

519
00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:39.579
Angela (Moderator): Yeah. how long do you think it would take you to get this information

520
00:55:39.870 --> 00:55:42.289
P4: that would take me a while? you know, it's in a bunch of different places. We have some files and things like that and other things like we get a prescription and we pay $11 for it. I'm not sure why, I'd even find that to be honest with you. You know the the flex account is pretty good, because I can get all those transactions from my my the website my flex card is on. It's the other stuff that was out of pocket like that. That might not be as easy to find.

524
00:56:11.530 --> 00:56:12.320
Angela (Moderator): Yeah. okay. let's put 3,000 for now, since keep going forward.

526
00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:25.580
P4: Okay, so college of vocational expenses. Click on that one there. And let me see.  okay, so this is just my own education, so that would be 0, although I always tell my wife, i'm not very bright. So I should go back to school.

529
00:56:42.510 --> 00:56:48.390
Angela (Moderator): I'm sure that's not true.

530
00:56:48.590 --> 00:56:53.610
P4: Okay, thankfully. No funerals. So that'd be a 0. Also.

531
00:56:53.910 --> 00:56:55.010
Angela (Moderator): Okay. any girl thoughts about this page.

533
00:57:02.670 --> 00:57:08.880
P4:  II my only thought off the top of my head is college of vocational expenses. If I have it dependent on paying their college or vocational expenses. Maybe that should be included. I'm curious why, it's not, but that's not part of the the debate of the Forum, so it makes sense. Everything's clear. When I clicked a couple of down arrows it gave me the answers I was looking for. So I think we're good.

537
00:57:32.170 --> 00:57:34.420
Angela (Moderator): Okay, we'll keep going.

538
00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:40.990
P4: Okay, so am I eligible for Medicaid? Not yet. So

541
00:57:49.170 --> 00:57:50.010
Angela (Moderator): okay.

542
00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:53.470
P4: Medicare. Let's let me read. I I've been reading up on Medicare because I have to sign up in March. Refill some of your information. Correct? Anything? Medicares. Okay. I am not enrolled. So I continue.

545
00:58:14.270 --> 00:58:15.100
Angela (Moderator): okay.

546
00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:33.869
P4: okay. So I made a decision 2 years ago, because I was 100% disabled at 100 disabled. I don't have to pay a copay and my stuff is pretty much covered, and then also part of being a hundred percent is that my wife becomes eligible for Champ Va health insurance. So we got her enrolled in Champ Va. and I use the VA. Exclusively. And so I cancelled my health insurance at work. So this question says, do you have health insurance. And my answer to that is, no.

552
00:59:10.290 --> 00:59:11.110
Angela (Moderator): okay.

553
00:59:11.530 --> 00:59:18.689
P4: so, or to add, and and the answer is, no, because I'm using just the vas. And now we continue

554
00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:19.950
Angela (Moderator): alright.

555
00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:28.849
P4: So we did all this information. So if we open up the plus, it'll just kind of show us the questions and answers. Right? Let's click on one. See it? Yeah, okay, that's kind of expected what? I thought. Okay. so that's that's good. So that that's a good place where you could double check all the information that you entered to make sure it was right. Okay, I like that. Okay, so and I would, I would double check all 3 of them. just to make sure that nothing's out of whack there.

563
01:00:07.630 --> 01:00:08.750
Angela (Moderator): Okay.

564
01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:14.089
P4: just going through quickly. Since we're over time. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So then I'd read this agreement. Any Copays agree. You can contact you address 98%. I'm the type that would actually open the privacy policy and read most of it. But we can skip that for now I just let you know just because I think I know what it's gonna say. And I'm usually not surprised. But just in case read more about assignment of benefits i'm not sure what that means let's, can we click that downer real quick.  okay, that's pretty standard. Okay. so I, would then I agree, I confirm that, I agree statements information, true, Yup, I can do that. Then I would submit it.

573
01:01:15.310 --> 01:01:24.040
Angela (Moderator): Okay. great. Well, that is the end of the form. So I'm gonna stop sharing. And I just have like a couple of quick. You know, closing questions there anything else that you would like to add about what we talked about today, or any questions that you have for me.

575
01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:43.439
P4:  no, II liked it. That is eligible there. or that it is clear that it makes sense that you can do those things online. The only thing I didn't C was. we added, we added a spouse and 2 dependents. So if I submit, that is, it completely submitted, or where do I get information like? Oh, you have to submit a marriage certificate. A birth certificate, all that kind of stuff. I didn't see anything that said that. but that would be part of it. But if that's going to be submitted online, I should be able to attach Pdfs of those things. so that would be. My only comment is that if I submitted that form I would be getting a letter from them, saying. Hey, - - - , we need to see your a marriage certificate to prove that you're married to your spouse. so it'd be better if it said since you've added a spouse. You need to submit. you know that at that point where you say, when were you married? And you put that date in there. Say, You have to attach a Pdf copy of your marriage certificate, or something like that, and you could include it as an attached document to that

588
01:03:03.890 --> 01:03:14.009
Angela (Moderator): Gotcha, and you said you expect, if you submitted this, and they didn't ask you that that they might send you a letter. Do you mean in your email or in the you know. Mail mail.

589
01:03:14.190 --> 01:03:14.920
P4: Yeah. Yeah. Usually it's the mail mail, and it comes slow. There's not real good email communication with the Va, at this point. I wish it would get better. And hopefully you're working on that. But cause emails faster. And it's easier. you know, social security's the same way. There's no emails with them at all. It's all paper stuff. So  okay. yeah, having gone through all that, I know that I have to submit the merge certificate, the birth certificates, all that stuff to show

595
01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:50.899
Angela (Moderator): alright any anything else, or anything you have questions about.

596
01:03:51.950 --> 01:03:56.189
P4: I don't think so. II like, I like the I like the updates.

597
01:03:56.840 --> 01:04:11.570
Angela (Moderator): Great so I just want to circle back and reconfirm that you're comfortable. If we were to share a video clip of the session with our partners and remove all information that could be used to identify you, and it would not be shared outside of the Va is that okay with you? Yes, no problem at all. Okay, and no part of the discussion that you would specifically not want shared.

600
01:04:19.690 --> 01:04:21.079
P4: I don't think so. No.

601
01:04:21.250 --> 01:04:40.759
Angela (Moderator): okay, Gotcha. Alright. Well, that is everything. And ----, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us and thank you so much for dealing with the technical difficulties. And patiently, I'm really sorry about that.
