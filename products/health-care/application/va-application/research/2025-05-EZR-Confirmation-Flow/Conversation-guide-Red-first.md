# Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is **[NAME]** and **[NOTETAKER NAME]** is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them... 

Today we're going to talk about making updates to health care information.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- **This entire session should take about 1 hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
  
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
  
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
  
- Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I want to be sure before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - If yes: Admit observers.
   - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)
   - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth
     
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype today.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. <mark>**Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.**</mark>
  
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.
   - **Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**

     
- **Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences?** One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image. Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not, but we like to ask ahead of time. At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.
   - **Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?**

   - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.**

➡️ **Start recording.**

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
 
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?**

# Warm-up Questions - 3 minutes

Before we look at the prototype, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

1. Do you have a service-connected disability at VA?
- If yes: what is your disability rating?
- If no, skip to question 2.
2. Have you recently visited VA.gov?
- If yes, asked if they've accessed it using a phone or tablet?

## RED FIRST - 12 minutes

- Today you’ll go through two different prototypes - option green and option red.

- Imagine you have a spouse and one dependent. You may have filled out a similar form before and now, they’re asking you to update your financial information. In this scenario, you logged into your VA.gov account, where the system has prefilled some of your information for you.

- For this scenario, are you comfortable with sharing your screen and talk through your process?

- I will now share a link to the prototype with you. [Share link to (https://www.figma.com/proto/tggcJk382w9yQ0ElwKfh3N/10-10EZR?node-id=8332-144952&t=WtgdBTqnbTbbPSPi-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=8109%3A122152&starting-point-node-id=8332%3A144952) in zoom chat]. Please be sure to close any personal information, like email, Facebook, etc., before you share your screen.  
 
- [If participant is unable to share  screen] I can share my screen for you

**[Start Form]**

- Let's start with the RED option.

**[Personal Information]**

- Please take a few moments to go through this page, I'd like you to think out loud as much as possible, noting if anything is confusing  
[Direct them through the form, inform them that they can click on continue when ready]
 
### Things to watch for:
- Do participants express any confusion about the verbiage used on this page? Especially around “Review your information before you continue”.
- Do they express any confusion or frustration with the direction and continue updating their personal information? 

**[Contact Info]**

- As I have mentioned before, in this scenario, this information came from previous information you’ve provided. For research purposes, you would be going through this form to make sure the fill-in in are accurate and makes sense.

**[Marital Status]**

- Okay, let's pause right here.  If you are no longer married, what do you expect to happen when you choose one of the other statuses?

**[Dependent Review]**

**[Financial Intro]**

- For this section, I will give you the financial information that you’ll need.

- For this scenario, you and your spouse’s work and salary have not changed from 2023 to 2024.

Information to be provided to the participant, via chat: 

> For this scenario, you and your spouse’s work and salary have not changed from 2023 to 2024.
>
> 
> Here is your financial information:
> 
> Numbers from your 2024 W2:
> 
> Your gross income: $62,400
> 
> Your net income: $47,798
> 
> Your other income: $0
>
> Number from your spouse’s 2024 W2:
> 
> Your spouse’s gross income: $50,895
> 
> Your spouse’s net income: $45,925
> 
> Your other income: $0
> 
> 
> Your 2024 expenses and deductibles:
>  
> Non-reimbursable medical expense: $3000
> 
> Education expense: $430
> 
> Funeral and Burial expense: $0 

### Things to watch for:
- Observe how the participant uses this information
- Does the amount of information slow them down?
- Do they check the numbers more than once?

**[Veteran Income]**

**[Spouse Income]**

**[Deductible Expenses]**

**[Deductible Expenses]**

- [After they get to the bottom of the page] Okay, let's pause here for a few questions:

- Was there any part that was confusing to you?
- When you saw the 2023 financial numbers, did it help you decide what to do next or does it make you second-guess if it's current? 
- On a scale of 1-5 (1 being very easy and 5 being very hard) - how difficult would it be for you to complete this financial information if you were doing this with your real information?
- Why did you give it that rating?
- Do you have any suggestions or feedback for making the page and the update process better?

**[Review]**
- [Did they catch the error?]
In this scenario, you realized that one of your expenses is incorrect. You had a big out-of-pocket dental operation last year of $3000. How would you fix that error?

- On a difficulty scale of 1-5 (1 being very easy and 5 being very hard) - how would you rate the form you just went through? Why did you give it that rating? 
- On an efficiency scale of 1-5 (1 being very efficient and 5 being very inefficient) - How would you rate the form you just went through? Why did you give it that rating?

- [Instruct them to click ‘End Demo” button to go back to the Start Form screen]

## GREEN SECOND - 10 minutes

**[Start Form]**
- Now that we've completed the RED option,  we will move onto the GREEN option. In this option, some screens will be the same and some will be different.

**[Personal Information]**

**[Mailing Address]**

**[Home Address]**

**[Contact Info]**
- Do you prefer reviewing your information page by page, like this option, or through cards like the previous option?
- Do you have a preference?
- Why do you think that?

**[Marital Status]**

**[Spouse Additional Info]**

**[Spouse Financial Support]**

**[Spouse Address Phone]**

**[Depedent Review]**

**[Financial Intro]**
- You can use the previous financial information that I gave you.  And it will be the same exact scenario, you and your spouse’s work and salary has not changed from 2023 to 2024.

**[Depedent Review]**

**[Veteran Income]**

**[Spouse Income]**

**[Deductible Expenses]**
- And let's pause here for a discussion:  In this (green) prototype, there is no gray box referencing the previous financial information.
- Was there any part of this section that was confusing to you?
- How was this financial section compared to the previous one?
- On a scale of 1-5 (1 being very easy and 5 being very hard) - how hard would it be for you to complete this financial information if you were doing this with your real information?
- Why did you give it that rating? 

**[Review]**

- On a difficulty scale of 1-5 (1 being very easy and 5 being very hard) - how would you rate the form you just went through? Why did you give it that rating? 
- On an efficiency scale of 1-5 (1 being very efficient and 5 being very inefficient) - How would you rate the form you just went through? Why did you give it that rating? 

# Post-Task Interview - 10 minutes

 I have a couple of last questions before we wrap up.

- What were your overall thoughts about the two prototypes we went over?
- Which of the two prototypes would you prefer to see on VA.gov? Why [that prototype]?
- Is there anything you'd change about the whole form if you could?

- I will now share screens and ask you to talk through a few different options. Figma Link:https://www.figma.com/design/tggcJk382w9yQ0ElwKfh3N/10-10EZR?node-id=9213-207108&t=7lOnW8Z83kMxXTCM-1

**[Personal Info]**
- Let’s take a look at these three options, each showing your personal information a different way. 
Can you talk through your thoughts here? 
Do you have a preference for which one you like best? And why?

**[Marital Status]**
- Let’s take a look at these two options. Do you have a preference for which one you like better? And why?

**[Marital Status - destructive message]**
- When you select a different marital status from what you have before, like from “married” to “divorced”, you get this message. 
Can you explain to me what this message means to you?

**[Financial Info]**
- [If time permits, asked them to compare the two financial options side-by-side]

- Thank you so much for going through the form with me. Do you have any questions for me?

## Consent to use video clips

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that **you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?** Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
   - **If yes:** Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?


## Thank-You and Closing - 1 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!


# Emergency Exit 🚨

In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). <mark>**Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.**</mark>
