## Research Goals
*Provide context for this research by explaining how it fits into the Veteran’s journey.*  
[See the Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)  

This study aims to evaluate two different flows; an existing MVP flow (Option Green) and the new Confirmation Flow (Option Red). This is to validate the Confirmation Flow and seek to identify any pain points, areas of confusion, and opportunities to enhance the flow. The insights gathered from this study will help inform the iterative design and well as clarify the next steps.

**Guiding Questions:**  
- What are the key moments this tool supports in the Veteran’s journey?  
- What outcomes are we aiming to achieve for Veterans and stakeholders?  

**Specific Goals:**  
- Goal 1: Spouse Information: Assess the usability of the spouse information section to see if the Veterans follow the conditional logic, understand what information can be updated, and whether the information presented is comprehensible.

- Goal 2: Confirmation Flow: Validate that Veterans prefer the confirmation flow (Option Red), using the List&Loop component, because it is more efficient than the existing MVP approach (Option Green).

- Goal 3: Gray Reference Card: Understand how the Veterans expect the previous year’s financial data to be prefilled, and whether they understand the hierarchy of the information on financial reporting screens.

[Example Research Goals](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/initiatives/2021-post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#research-goals) 



## Research Questions

**Spouse Information:** Test the usability of the spouse information section to see if the Veterans follow the conditional logic, what information can be updated, and whether the information presented is comprehensible.

**Confirmation Flow:** Validate that the confirmation flow (Option Red), using the List&Loop component, is more efficient than the existing MVP approach (Option Green).

**Gray Reference Card:** Understand how the Veterans expect the previous year’s data to be prefilled, and do they understand the hierarchy of the information.

## Methodology 

- Semi-structured interviews
- Moderated usability testing on [3] tasks, using the think-aloud protocol:
  - Task 1: Updating spouse's address
  - Task 2: Fill out your previous year’s financial information
  - Task 3: Edit an error in your spouse’s financial information

Note that after the spouse section, users will fork for A/B testing of the proposed confirmation flow and MVP experience:

- Cohort A will see Option Green first, called Prototype Green [Existing version of the Financial Information, moderator provides last year’s financial information]
- Cohort B will see Option Red first, called Prototype Red [Confirmation Flow version with the gray box reference, moderator does not provide last year’s financial information]

[Example Methodology](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/initiatives/2021-post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#methodology)


## Hypotheses and Conclusions

- **Hypothesis Statement: The participant will understand the Spouse Information and Financial Information shown in List & Loop's review page** 
  - **Likely True**  
  - 8/10 participants expressed a clear understanding of spouse and financial information List & Loop component.  

- **Hypothesis Statement: The participant will prefer the Confirmation Flow (Option Red) over the existing MVP flow (Option Green)**   
  - **Maybe True**  
  - 6/10 participants prefer Option Red while 4/10 participants prefer Option Green.

- **Hypothesis Statement: The participant will ask more questions, require more time to understand the content in the gray reference card component**  
  - **Maybe True**
  - Several participants were initially hesitant or confused by the Gray Box reference, but 6 out of 10 found the section clear and straightforward overall.


## Key Findings

*Summarize the 5–10 most impactful findings from your study.* 

**1.** Participants expressed a clear understanding of the spouse and financial information List&Loop component.

**2.** There is a slightly higher preference for Optional Red (Confirmation Flow) over Option Green (existing MVP flow). 

**3.** Many participants expected VA.gov to operate in ways consistent with their mental models.


## Details of Findings 

*Provide detailed descriptions and supporting evidence for each key finding.*  

**Finding 1: Participants generally understood the List & Loop component for the spouse and financial information, but want more contextual guidance and content consolidation around the List & Loop's intro and review pages.**
- 7 out of 10 participants found that the financial section was easy to understand in both prototypes.
- Participants expressed a need for the List & Loop to have clear guidance or to consolidate its content.
    - 3 participants felt that the Dependent List&Loop Intro should be merged with the next page.
    - 5 participants wanted more dynamic content or upfront information on gathering the required financial information.

  *Note: Despite several participants wanting an option to match the Spouse's address with the Veteran's address, it is not needed. The only time they'll see the option to input the Spouse's address is when they indicated that the Spouse does not live with the Veteran. We speculated that many overlooked this question since the Figma prototype automatically had this answer as a "no" to route the participant to this scenario.*

- 4 participants suggested adding details like Date of Marriage to the Spouse Review page to reduce the need for checking or backtracking.

Key quotes:

- *P3: "Why don't you combine the 2 (financial intro and income pages) again? It's just this question, right? It's just this question. And then when you click next, it all expands out to include what I'm trying to put in".*
- *P8: "A little synopsis of just like these questions in the [review accordion]. So that when they come back...they can verify it without having to click the edit button" (re: spouse review page).*

**Finding 2: Participants showed a slight preference for Option Red (Confirmation Flow) over Option Green (existing MVP flow) due to the perceived speed and helpful reference information.**

- 6 out of 10 participants preferred Option Red, citing efficiency and helpful references. The remaining 4 preferred Option Green.
- 5 out of 10 participants noted that both flows felt similar and 2 of those did not express a strong preference for either.
- 6 out of 10 participants found that the gray box referencing previously filled information to be helpful for context, even if the information wasn't directly relevant to them.
- 6 out of 10 participants prefer the Veteran's personal information to be within a white box with a black border, citing that the area needs their attention, 2 out of 10 participants prefer it to be gray, 1 participant prefers the existing address block, and 1 participant has no preference.

  *The personal information box shows the Veteran's name, birthday, social security number, and sex. In a [previous study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/41879e5885eea6f0f2965b1ba51f7c65407d863d/products/authenticated-patterns/Design-and-research/2024-09-Research-Initiative-Two-Update-Prefill/Update%20Prefill%20Research%20Report.md#hypotheses-and-conclusions) by the Authenticated Patterns team, they compared several different formats, resulting in the recommendation for the white box with a black border for editable and uneditable data. In our collaboration with this team, we presented three options: an address block formatting, a gray box formatting, and a white box with a black border. The participants overwhelmingly chose the white box with a black border as their preference.*

- 6 out of 10 participants prefer the Marital Status question to use radio button options over the 2 participants that prefer a dropdown menu, citing that it is easier to see and requires fewer clicks. The last 2 participants have no preference.



Key quotes:

- *P3: "Fast, and that's why I think Option Red would be better in terms of speed and knocking this out".*
- *P3: "If I don't know 2023's gross (income) off the top of my head, that requires me to open up another document in my files for the gross income. So that's very, very helpful" (re: gray box reference).*
- *P6: "I think it's useful to have this information just so you can kind of sometimes, you know, like 'did I earn more money this year?' ".*
- *P8: "I'm kinda on the fence. I like the gray boxes with information, but I also like the clean slate of just knowing to put what's focused for 2024".*

**Finding 3: Participants expected VA.gov to align with their mental models around progress tracking, data handling, and form behavior. Any mismatch in these areas led to confusion and frustration.**
- 5 participants found the Stepper Progress Bar to be confusing and unhelpful. One participant suggested an alternative, like a checklist or task list, for better orientation.

  - *P4: "How much longer is this going to take? I'm still on number 2".*
  - *P6: "Even if you click on next page, you're still not moving, kind of, this one bar".*

- 3 participants assumed that the prefilled information was from their VA profile.

  - *P7: "This is stuff that you put in when you first create a VA account. So this again, you moved, or something, got a new phone, this is not going to change."

- 1 participant, who works with homeless services, noted that improving online accessibility and standardized support communications could reduce wait times and make it easier for homeless Veterans to receive timely assistance.

Key quotes: 

- *P9: "The biggest issue, I think, that I see my vets have is setting up their MyHealtheVet. That is the biggest problem: they get confused. They can't remember their password. I tell them, 'Go into the VA, they got an office set up for that.' So that's a barrier in and of itself".*
- *P9: Veteran not accessing this (health care portal), it delays them by weeks. They have to go do the paper form, so they have to get it, fill it out, take it into enrollment and eligibility. They're waiting on this to be completed so they can get homeless services versus if this were more accessible. It would be just be easier for them".*

## **Additional Insights**

**Additional Insights 1: Participants found the flow easy to use, reinforcing patterns from previous studies around clarity and supportive UI elements.**
- All participants had recently used VA.gov.
- Every section of the form has several participants, indicating the form is clear and straightforward.
- Like [past studies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/research/2023-06-Priority%20Group%20and%20Financial%20Disclosure/research-findings.md), many participants responded positively to the save-in-progess messages, hint text, pre-fill, and additional information component.
  - 7 participants expanded the additional information component to read the description, with 5 expilicity indicating it is helpful.
  - 6 participants mentioned that the save-in-progess alert is good.
 
Key quotes:

- *P1: "I would be zipping through this. This isn't rocket science, really".*
- *P9: "These dropdown boxes are awesome". (re: additional information component*

**Additional Insight 2: Participants prefer the online experience over the phone for making updates.**
- 3 participants expressed a clear preference for self-service editing over calling, citing long wait times and complicated menus.

Key quote:

- *P5: "I hate having to call 800 number to do things, especially if it's the VA general number trying to work through a menu to get the right person. It's never fun."

**Additional Insight 3: The are drawbacks to using Figma for Prototype testing.**
- 9 out of 10 participants have a service-connected disability rating of 50% or higher, meaning they aren't usually required to fill out the financial section.

- 3 participants expect an option for spouse address to match the Veteran's address, not realizing this is a conditional flow.

  - *P4: "If your spouse's address is different from the Veterans, you know, then give me this option (to edit)".*
  - Note: For the user to see the Spouse Address page, they must selected "No" for "Do you currently have the same address as your spouse?". But since it is a Figma prototype, the "No" was pres-select some some participants was not aware of this conditional flow.

Key quotes:
- *P1: "None of this would be pertinent to me".*
- *P4: "I've never been asked for any of my financial information. Very invasive. I think".*

## Recommendations

**Recommendation 1: Improve the List & Loop clarity**
- Consider providing additional information such as the date of marriage for the spouse's List & Loop's Review screen.
- Improve the guidance with informational content at the List & Loop Introduction screens, especially for the financial section.

**Recommendation 2: Optimize the health care flow to be more aligned with the Veteran's mental model**
- Change the Marital Status option from the dropdown to radio buttons. 
- Update the Veteran's personal information box from using the address block to the white box with black border. 

**Recommendation 3: Optimize Confirmation Flow (Option Red)**
- Adopt or hybridize the Confirmation Flow. Participants like the efficiency features of Option Red, such as the gray box reference, minimal toggle, and more condensed presentation of information.
- Consider a customized Contact Information (Address, phone, and email) List & Loop.
- Explore ways to make the Gray Reference box for income clearer.

**Recommendation 4: Improve Accessibility for unhoused veterans**
- Offer an unhoused option for the address in the 10-10EZ Health Enrollment.

**Recommendation 5: Explore ways for Va.gov to be in better alignment with the Veteran's mental model**
- Explore integration with VA Profile to prefilled personal information through the health care process.
- Explore ways to redesign the stepper component that could be incorprate by the larger OCTO team, such as the task list or percentage stepper component. 

**Recommendation 6: Prototype Testing considerations**
- Improve scenario clarity in Figma-based testing (such as limiting it only to Veterans with Disability Rating under 50%).
- Supplement Figma prototype testing with additional UAT for Assistive Tech users. 

## Product User and Business Outcomes

- **Desired User Outcome**
  - Veterans experience a faster, more efficient application process by being able to review and edit their Household information in a consolidated view, rather than navigating through page-by-page updates. This reduces the time and effort required to complete the 10-10EZR form, leading to greater satisfaction and fewer barriers to completion.
 
- **Deisred Business Outcome**
  - The VHA receives more accurate and up-to-date household data from Veterans, as the streamlined “review and edit” approach encourages thorough review and correction of information. This improves data quality for healthcare eligibility and resource planning, ultimately supporting better decision-making and service delivery.


## Key Performance Indicators

- **KPI 1**
  -  Reduced time on Household section | Baseline | Target | Link to data source (e.g. GA, Domo)


## Next Steps

- Refined the EZR based on the feedback from this study (cosmetic and content updates).
- Continue the development of the Confirmation Flow (Insurance Information section, Military Information section, Contact Information section, etc).
- Explore Stepper Progress Bar component alternative.
- Explore VA Profile integration.


## Further research needed

**Accessibility testing with assistive technology users**
- We used a Figma prototype for this study, which made it hard for accessibility-focused testing. In the near future, especially after updating the flow based on the feedback for this study, we plan to test the flow with participants who use assistive technology, either using a coded prototype or the staging site.
