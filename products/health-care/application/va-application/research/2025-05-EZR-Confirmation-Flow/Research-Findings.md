## Research Goals
*Provide context for this research by explaining how it fits into the Veteran’s journey.*  
[See the Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)  

**Guiding Questions:**  
- What are the key moments this tool supports in the Veteran’s journey?  
- What outcomes are we aiming to achieve for Veterans and stakeholders?  

[Example Research Goals](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/initiatives/2021-post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#research-goals) 



## Research Questions

**Spouse Information:** Test the usability of the spouse information section to see if the Veterans follow the conditional logic, what information can be updated, and whether the information presented is comprehensible.

**Confirmation Flow:** Validate that the confirmation flow (Option Red), using the List&Loop component, is more efficient than the existing MVP approach (Option Green).

**Gray Reference Card:** Understand how the Veterans expect the previous year’s data to be prefilled, and do they understand the hierarchy of the information.

## Methodology 

- Semi-structured interviews
- Moderated usability testing on [3] tasks, using the think-aloud protocol:
  - Task 1: Updating spouse's address
  - Task 2: Fill out your previous year’s financial information
  - Task 3: Edit an error in your spouse’s financial information

Note that after the spouse section, users will fork for A/B testing of the proposed confirmation flow and MVP experience:

- Cohort A will see Option Green first, called Prototype Green [Existing version of the Financial Information, moderator provides last year’s financial information]
- Cohort B will see Option Red first, called Prototype Red [Confirmation Flow version with the gray box reference, moderator does not provide last year’s financial information]

[Example Methodology](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/initiatives/2021-post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#methodology)


## Hypotheses and Conclusions

- **Hypothesis Statement: The participant will understand the Spouse Information and Financial Information shown in List&Looop's review page** [Insert statement]  
  - **Likely True**  
  - 8/10 participants expressed a clear understanding of spouse and financial information List & Loop component.  

- **Hypothesis Statement: The participant will prefer the Confirmation Flow (Option Red) over the existing MVP flow (Option Green)** [Insert statement]  
  - **Maybe True**  
  - 6/10 participants prefer Option Red while 4/10 participants prefer Option Green.

- **Hypothesis Statement:** [Insert statement]  
  - **"Maybe True", “Likely True”, “Definitely True”, “Likely False”, “Definitely False” or “Not enough information”**  
  - Supporting evidence  


## Key Findings

*Summarize the 5–10 most impactful findings from your study.* 

> [!TIP] 
> Write findings as stand-alone insights that are easy to scan. For example:  
> - "Most participants used the search field to locate forms, often searching for 'veteran health.'"  
> - "Participants struggled with the secondary caregiver section on the form."  

[Example Key Findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/initiatives/2021-post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#key-findings)

**1.** Participants expressed a clear understanding of the spouse and financial information List&Loop component.

**2.** There is a slightly higher preference for Optional Red (Confirmation Flow) over Option Green (existing MVP flow). 

**3.** Many participants expected VA.gov to operate in ways consistent with their mental models.
