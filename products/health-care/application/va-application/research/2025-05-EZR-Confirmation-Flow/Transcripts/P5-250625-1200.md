00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:09.050
Hieu: So I have started the recording. I'd like to confirm that. Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today.

2
00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:09.980
P5: Yes, sir.

3
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:17.300
Hieu: Alright. And then, are you comfortable? We decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with our Va partners.

4
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.340
P5: Yes, sir.

5
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:26.560
Hieu: Alrighty. Thank you for that. And then for a couple warm-up questions, do you have a service-connected disability rating at the Va.

6
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:27.710
P5: Yes, I do.

7
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.699
Hieu: And then what? What is your disability rating.

8
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:39.700
P5: 10%, 10%, all right. And then, have you recently visited the va.gov yes.

9
00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.699
Hieu: May I ask? For what reason?

10
00:00:42.477 --> 00:00:46.180
P5: Probably to check on an appointment.

11
00:00:46.610 --> 00:01:10.610
Hieu: Alrighty, thank you. And then so we'll jump right on to our prototype. Today. Today we'll be work. You'll be going through 2 different prototype. One is option green and the other is option red for this scenario. Imagine that you have one spouse and one dependent, and then you have filled out a similar form before now. They're asking you to update your financial information

12
00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:26.360
Hieu: for this. You've logged onto va.gov. The account where the system has pre-filled some of the information for you, and then for this scenario. Are you comfortable with sharing your screen as you talk through the process.

13
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.200
P5: That's fine!

14
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.670
Hieu: Okay, let me get you the a link to our prototype.

15
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.699
Hieu: And then may I ask if you are on Mobile or desktop.

16
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.020
P5: Desktop.

17
00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.600
Hieu: Okay, this is a little bit easier than

18
00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.570
Hieu: so do you see my link in the chat?

19
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.310
P5: Yes.

20
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:59.569
Hieu: Alright. You can click on that. And while it's loading, please close out, close out any kind of personal information like Facebook email or whatnot before you share your screen.

21
00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.410
P5: No, I'm I'm in there. And how do I? Okay? So I click on share.

22
00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.709
Hieu: Yeah. So in your zoom screen you'll see at the bottom. Yep.

23
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.485
P5: Yeah.

24
00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.939
Hieu: And there's probably an option to share just a

25
00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.180
Hieu: browser. Yep, I see it all right, and then you can adjust it. However, you want to

26
00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.920
Hieu: make it easier on yourself.

27
00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.669
P5: And it should be fine.

28
00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:01.850
Hieu: Okay? And then so for our purposes, let's go with the option green.

29
00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:12.190
Hieu: and then you can click on that. Yeah, please take a few moments to go through this page. I like you to think out loud as much as possible, noting anything that's confusing.

30
00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.940
Hieu: And then, you know, just go through your thoughts, thinking out loud.

31
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.690
P5: Pretty clear there. I guess I would verify the

32
00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.139
P5: name, social security number, date of birth.

33
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.170
Hieu: And then I just wanna clarify that for the scenario. You are Riley Smith.

34
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.836
P5: Sure, I I assumed that.

35
00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:44.880
P5: Okay.

36
00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.229
Hieu: So no issue on your end.

37
00:03:49.540 --> 00:04:00.750
P5: No quick, quick question at the very bottom. It says, we've saved your request. Which request, and I know this is just the prototype. What request is that? Referring to.

38
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.929
Hieu: Okay, so is that slightly confusing to you.

39
00:04:04.343 --> 00:04:10.009
P5: Just just wondering, I guess if if I was doing this for real, I would probably understand what that was.

40
00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:16.919
P5: But I guess it's just for the prototype. It's just referring to a fictional request that was done sometime in the past.

41
00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:23.579
Hieu: Gotcha. Usually when you fill out something or do some kind of action, that message will pop up.

42
00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.989
P5: Okay, do I click on, continue.

43
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.950
Hieu: Yes, please.

44
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:43.810
Hieu: And then, as I mentioned before, this information came from previous information that you've provided in this scenario, and then for your for the research purposes you're going through this form to make sure the fill in are accurate and make sense.

45
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:44.540
P5: Sure.

46
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:56.769
P5: And oh, obviously, since I'm in Scranton, Pennsylvania, I wouldn't check us military base outside the Us.

47
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:09.410
P5: Do. I just leave that about home address, same as mailing as as no, or yeah, sure

48
00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:10.259
P5: not at all.

49
00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.270
Hieu: So. For this scenario it you have a different home address than your.

50
00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.640
P5: Okay.

51
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.100
Hieu: Us.

52
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.010
P5: Gotcha.

53
00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.370
P5: Okay, continue.

54
00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:36.460
P5: Okay, looks like it's verifying the same information. Or is that the mailing address, instead of the home address?

55
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.899
P5: I think that Address Street address was different.

56
00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.420
Hieu: Okay, yeah, that is correct.

57
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.070
P5: All right, so continue.

58
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.880
Hieu: Okay.

59
00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:56.800
P5: Okay.

60
00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:58.620
Hieu: Okay.

61
00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.920
P5: And Mary just said, I do have a spouse.

62
00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:07.010
Hieu: Yeah.

63
00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:28.200
P5: Okay, so leave those. I guess those are no, for a reason.

64
00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.420
Hieu: Yeah, for this scenario. They're both being no.

65
00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:44.229
P5: I was a terrible husband. Didn't know financial support.

66
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.359
Hieu: But so far so straightforward for you.

67
00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.390
P5: Yeah, yep, it is.

68
00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:00.880
P5: And there's my phone.

69
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.070
P5: No dependent.

70
00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:24.760
Hieu: Then I'll stop you right here for this session. I'll give you financial information that you'll need for this scenario. You and your spouse's work and salary has not changed from 2023 to 2024. If you're doing this for real, you would have to gather this information yourself.

71
00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:26.380
P5: But you know I've.

72
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:29.689
Hieu: Basically would just give you this information here.

73
00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:35.009
Hieu: and for the demo purposes, you don't really need it. But you know, in

74
00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:39.270
Hieu: in reality you would need this these information separately.

75
00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:44.310
P5: Sure, so do I need to enter that, or just.

76
00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:53.470
Hieu: Yeah. So you you have to enter that. But since this is a demo prototype, it will. The program will enter it automatically for you.

77
00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:54.380
P5: Okay.

78
00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.659
Hieu: So I think if you just click on that.

79
00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:59.410
P5: Did. Oh, twice. Okay.

80
00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:05.020
P5: okay.

81
00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:09.380
P5: all right.

82
00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:10.930
P5: Can you

83
00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.490
P5: name on the screen? Then.

84
00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.040
Hieu: Yep, same on this one.

85
00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.660
P5: And I guess I would have to.

86
00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.710
P5: Well, it explains all the different deductions.

87
00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.710
Hieu: Everything is straightforward for you.

88
00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:53.320
P5: Yeah.

89
00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:54.280
Hieu: Okay.

90
00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:00.684
Hieu: and then I'll stop you right there.

91
00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:05.909
Hieu: Was there any part of that financial information that was confusing to you?

92
00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:10.089
P5: Not really. Once I look back and it said, you know the types of

93
00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:18.060
P5: what specific information is looking for for the deductions. You know barrel expenses, medical things like that.

94
00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:21.280
Hieu: And then go ahead.

95
00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:27.629
P5: Yeah. So I mean, it was once I I saw that I mean, I've said I would have to gather that information.

96
00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:31.679
P5: but I should have access to that, with no problem.

97
00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:44.450
Hieu: Gotcha, and then on a scale of one to 5, 1 being very easy and 5 being very hard, how difficult would it be for you to complete this financial information. If you were to do this with real information.

98
00:09:48.008 --> 00:09:54.489
P5: probably a 1, because I I know where all my information is. If I had to go out and gather it

99
00:09:54.820 --> 00:10:04.580
P5: for some people. I'm sure that would be more of an issue trying to gather that information. There's no way to like bypass that or anything. If if somebody says, hey? I don't have that information.

100
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:11.300
Hieu: Okay. So you you would want something to bypass that if they don't have that readily available.

101
00:10:11.786 --> 00:10:12.760
P5: I would

102
00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:20.929
P5: I? I wanna say yes, but it may be because of the information that's being asked. It's required. So I've got to go find it somewhere.

103
00:10:22.393 --> 00:10:29.199
P5: So I guess not bypass it, or you know just something to stress that you. You know you have to put this information in.

104
00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:29.890
Hieu: Right.

105
00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:30.520
P5: Yeah.

106
00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:31.846
Hieu: And then

107
00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:40.090
Hieu: So you say, because you keep all that information and you know where to get it. It's relatively easy for you as well to

108
00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:43.690
Hieu: to kind of bring up or to gather that information.

109
00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:47.779
P5: Yes, it it would be for me, I'm sure, like this for some people. I'm sure it wouldn't be.

110
00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:50.919
Hieu: I gotcha all right, and then we could continue here.

111
00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:53.450
P5: Okay.

112
00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:03.829
P5: Now, this, we're veteran information household. Is that basically the information I just entered?

113
00:11:04.802 --> 00:11:05.850
P5: Yes, that is correct.

114
00:11:08.607 --> 00:11:12.140
P5: Agree, agree agree.

115
00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:14.870
Hieu: Okay, before you press anything.

116
00:11:15.842 --> 00:11:18.169
Hieu: This is the review page, and it

117
00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:22.430
Hieu: can you scroll back up so for this one?

118
00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:26.239
Hieu: If you're doing this for real, this this

119
00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:29.240
Hieu: graphic right here. It doesn't stand out to you as

120
00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:32.620
Hieu: kind of indicating that you can review it.

121
00:11:33.379 --> 00:11:36.570
P5: I kind of assumed that with that plus sign there.

122
00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:49.989
P5: I guess if I was doing this for real cause, like you were saying, well, this is part of the demo doing it for real. I would go in and verify that if I click on this, will anything happen.

123
00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:52.220
Hieu: Yeah, yeah, expand.

124
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:54.370
P5: Okay.

125
00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:03.999
P5: Yep, that's what I would expect.

126
00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.220
P5: House information.

127
00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:29.420
Hieu: And then in this scenario you realize that one of your expenses incorrect. You had a big out of pocket dental operation last year of $3,000. How would you fix that error.

128
00:12:30.747 --> 00:12:31.822
P5: Let's see.

129
00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:37.600
P5: and get down to the deduction. There we go.

130
00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:45.280
P5: Probably in this thing here the non reimbursable medical expenses.

131
00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:46.040
Hieu: Okay.

132
00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:51.439
P5: I would click on. Oh, I guess edit for that.

133
00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:52.099
Hieu: I gotcha.

134
00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:53.480
P5: And then enter that.

135
00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:55.380
Hieu: And then you just do it right here.

136
00:12:56.220 --> 00:13:09.419
Hieu: Okay? And then, in terms of this whole form, so far from beginning to end, how difficult was it for you, for one on a scale of one to 5, 1 being very easy, and 5 being very hard.

137
00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:12.899
P5: I for me personally a 1.

138
00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:15.350
Hieu: Okay, so this whole form is relatively easy for you.

139
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:22.029
P5: Yeah, yes. But again, knowing that other people, some people may have more of a problem with that, yeah.

140
00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:30.250
Hieu: And then on an efficiency scale, with one being very efficient and 5 being very inefficient, how would you rate the form that you just went through.

141
00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:47.320
P5: it's it's very efficient, you know. Let's say one. Now, one question. I have the way that it's formed on my desktop screen. It's long and narrow. Is that because a lot of people would do this on a phone.

142
00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:50.429
Hieu: So this is the mobile version. Correct?

143
00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:54.620
Hieu: If you're okay, if it's a desktop version, it would expand.

144
00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:58.999
P5: Gotcha that makes sense. Then. Yeah, it should be fine.

145
00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:03.430
P5: you know. All the information seems there, and it's pretty clear. Standard.

146
00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:11.089
Hieu: Right, and then so on the scale of the efficiency scale from one to 5. Do you have a rating for that? Then.

147
00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:12.979
P5: One being very efficient.

148
00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:14.009
Hieu: Yeah, that is correct.

149
00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:15.160
P5: I'd say one.

150
00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:21.069
Hieu: Okay, yeah, thank you for that feedback. And then you can end the this portion of the demo here.

151
00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:36.479
Hieu: Alright, now that you have complete the green option. We'll move on to the red option, and in this option there's some screens will be the same, and some will be different. So you can go ahead and go in there and then, like I mentioned before, you're just

152
00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:40.750
Hieu: kind of thinking out loud as you're going through this.

153
00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:41.440
P5: Sure.

154
00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:48.950
P5: Okay, so very 1st thing, I verify that. Yeah, this is me we're talking about. And all that information is correct.

155
00:14:54.530 --> 00:15:00.350
P5: is there a way other than calling the 800 number to update any of this information?

156
00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:05.230
Hieu: We're saying like, in case it's incorrect.

157
00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:07.089
P5: Yeah, like, say, birthday is wrong.

158
00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:12.799
P5: My name should, of course, should be correct. Social security number could definitely be correct. But

159
00:15:13.341 --> 00:15:23.620
P5: date of birth. I'm not sure who actually enters this information at the beginning. There's something I do online, or is something that the Va support people put in there.

160
00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:27.439
P5: I'm not sure how that's verified when it's 1st entered. I guess.

161
00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:35.069
Hieu: I gotcha, but you like, for example, the date of birth, to be more editable from your side of things.

162
00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:49.970
P5: Possibly, you know, because I I hate having to call 800 numbers to do things and especially that, you know, if it's the Va. General number trying to work through a menu

163
00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:53.200
P5: to get the right person is never fun.

164
00:15:53.645 --> 00:16:05.020
P5: Now, personally, I would. I'm I'm at the Va. I volunteer at the Va. Here in Charlotte every Thursday, so I could. I would just go there personally and do this into the Enrollment section.

165
00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:05.740
Hieu: I gotcha.

166
00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:08.449
P5: Yeah, I would not even try to call and do any of that.

167
00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:13.089
Hieu: But for yourself, you wouldn't want to go through the the phone system. Basically.

168
00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:14.959
P5: Right. And that's just.

169
00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.880
Hieu: Personal preference or lack of preference.

170
00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:18.610
Hieu: That's fair.

171
00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:19.290
P5: Yes.

172
00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:20.619
Hieu: Thank you for that.

173
00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:22.840
Hieu: Yeah, we can continue.

174
00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:26.415
P5: Okay.

175
00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:34.040
P5: Main addresses look, good phone numbers. Good current. Yes.

176
00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:42.649
Hieu: We'll pause here. Do you prefer this overview option, or the detailed one in the option green prototype.

177
00:16:43.542 --> 00:16:47.419
P5: This is fine, because it's all condensed. It's 1, you know.

178
00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:52.999
P5: once area, you know, it's it's not spread out over multiple screens.

179
00:16:53.402 --> 00:17:04.580
P5: So this is fine and easier to me. It's easier where I can. I can see mailing address. Boom! There it is, and there's an edit button right there, I can click on same with with the other contact information.

180
00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:06.360
P5: Yeah.

181
00:17:06.369 --> 00:17:10.989
Hieu: And then do you have a preference over one or the other, or there? You're indifferent to it.

182
00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:18.860
P5: I kind of like this better again, because it's simpler. It's all in one place. Yeah.

183
00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:19.930
Hieu: Gotcha.

184
00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:22.109
P5: Especially if I'm on my phone.

185
00:17:22.329 --> 00:17:23.109
Hieu: Right?

186
00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:28.729
Hieu: Yeah, thank you for that. We can move. We move along.

187
00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:41.270
P5: Okay? Aaron. Okay, that's pretty clear.

188
00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:42.580
Hieu: Okay.

189
00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:59.009
P5: Now, the one thing I would kinda look cross right at here is there's my spouse's name, and it says, married. Well.

190
00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:01.189
P5: this is my spouse. So yeah, they're married.

191
00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:07.610
P5: Is that is that referring back to this person's status, Jordan Smith, status

192
00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:12.080
Hieu: Okay, so slightly confusing to you in.

193
00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:17.069
P5: It's gonna that to me that seems like unnecessary information that may confuse somebody.

194
00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:18.370
Hieu: Okay?

195
00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:23.760
Hieu: And then do you have a suggestion on what to put there instead? Then.

196
00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:30.490
P5: If if that's supposed to be my spouse, I would that would be blank. Well, of course they're married. They're my spouse.

197
00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:31.640
Hieu: Gotcha.

198
00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:45.229
P5: So, yeah, now, if it was one of those things where we were divorced, or whatever, of course, would be a totally different scenario. But yeah. And again, it's this, I don't say, that's confusing. I would just look at that and say, Why is that even there.

199
00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.260
Hieu: Gotcha.

200
00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:52.790
Hieu: Okay, we can move on.

201
00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:56.760
P5: Okay.

202
00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:58.380
P5: Now

203
00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:07.879
P5: it's interesting. Here is that dependence in the. It's been pre-filled. And my all that information was there. My spouse's was there, but not my dependents.

204
00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:15.130
P5: You know. Why. Why isn't my dependence information on that screen, instead of

205
00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:16.689
P5: we're going to ask you about them.

206
00:19:17.235 --> 00:19:20.000
Hieu: You rather have it. The same process, like.

207
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:20.380
P5: That is.

208
00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:21.470
Hieu: But to your spouse.

209
00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:25.389
P5: Yeah. Because if it if that's pre-filled, why can't this be pre-filled.

210
00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:26.290
Hieu: Gotcha.

211
00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:26.860
P5: Yeah.

212
00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:31.069
Hieu: And then we can continue.

213
00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:32.090
P5: Okay.

214
00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:42.039
P5: Alright, that's pretty clear, and I can see having son there because it could be a daughter.

215
00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:46.180
P5: Yep, this should be fine.

216
00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:47.290
Hieu: Okay.

217
00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:58.689
P5: One thing, and I probably can't go back, but is that I can add up to 5 more dependents. What if I have more than 6 dependents.

218
00:19:58.690 --> 00:19:59.719
Hieu: You can go back.

219
00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.967
P5: It says you can add up to 5 more.

220
00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:08.709
P5: What if I have 7 kids.

221
00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:12.498
Hieu: Would it be frustrating for you to

222
00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:16.680
Hieu: to reach that like, let's say the 6th kid. Then.

223
00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:19.429
P5: Yeah, well, I would think so, because.

224
00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:22.709
P5: you know, that's telling me I can only add 5 more.

225
00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:34.192
P5: So if I, knowing that I've got 7 kids, you know, I'd be thinking, Okay, how do I? I guess I would add the 5. And then wonder if there was maybe a place to say, Yeah, I got one more.

226
00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:36.350
P5: So.

227
00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:40.369
Hieu: Right that makes sense.

228
00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:44.310
P5: Yeah, I could see that being a an issue for some, because this people have a lot of kids.

229
00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:45.270
Hieu: Right.

230
00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:59.280
P5: Now up the top it says, full Pdf, form, title, Va. Form number.

231
00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:00.839
Hieu: On my part it looks.

232
00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:05.205
P5: Okay, because I went to, I'd be thinking what Pdf form?

233
00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:16.529
P5: Okay, income and deductible expenses to add for 2024. Now. This.

234
00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:22.950
P5: I think, would rather ask me that, because I'd be wondering. Okay, do I have everything in it already?

235
00:21:23.633 --> 00:21:33.180
P5: I mean, it's already again. I've already entered that information before in theory. Well, I guess I guess this different scenario. I haven't entered this information yet.

236
00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:38.290
P5: I'm I'm I have to forget that I even did the green.

237
00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:41.490
Hieu: This is a completely different flow.

238
00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:47.769
P5: Yeah, completely different flow. So I haven't entered this yet. Do I have income deductible expenses?

239
00:21:48.632 --> 00:21:49.757
P5: To add,

240
00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:57.650
P5: I guess in that situation. I would say yes.

241
00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:02.790
P5: because it doesn't, doesn't know where to click on here and saying, Well, what additional

242
00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:10.720
P5: expenses could I be able to add? I know. Probably when I go to the next screen, it's gonna say examples or something.

243
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.279
Hieu: Okay, yeah. Let's say, if you want a little bit more information on that screen, there.

244
00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:27.410
P5: yeah, let's see here.

245
00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:34.630
P5: I'm just trying to think on again from the previous flow, you know, when it says something about

246
00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:41.569
P5: deductible expenses, and there was a thing you could click on that said examples or explanations, or something.

247
00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:42.720
Hieu: Gotcha.

248
00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:43.600
P5: So

249
00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:49.399
P5: And on a click continue, it's apparently has been.

250
00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:52.199
P5: Some of it has been pre-filled.

251
00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:56.540
Hieu: And then this I'm sorry. Go ahead.

252
00:22:56.540 --> 00:23:01.079
P5: No? Well, I see like this year for gross income. It says what we consider gross income.

253
00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:12.860
P5: yeah, I guess it's just hard for me, you know, from the previous

254
00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:18.810
P5: form flow. There was a you know, more of an explanation.

255
00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:20.770
Hieu: Okay.

256
00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:24.009
P5: But and that's not a huge deal, because

257
00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:28.289
P5: this explains that I I know what gross income is. I know what net

258
00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:31.200
P5: income is, you know from any of those things?

259
00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:41.210
P5: Now, I do have a question. Okay, this is okay.

260
00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:46.920
P5: Up top your annual income from 2024. Then it says, income from 2023

261
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:49.879
P5: net income from 2023.

262
00:23:57.810 --> 00:24:13.179
P5: Oh, I see what it is. It's looking at changes. So this, this is pre-filled to 2023, and then the 2024. So it's you can see what? My, how much my income changed from one year to the next 2023, and then I would enter 2024.

263
00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:16.469
P5: Okay, now I understand it.

264
00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:22.400
P5: I didn't didn't catch that first.st

265
00:24:24.707 --> 00:24:32.730
P5: You know. Here it was looking for it was giving me what it was from previous year, and then I would have to enter the current year.

266
00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:33.680
Hieu: Right.

267
00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:38.884
P5: Okay, other income. All right.

268
00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:44.290
P5: maybe something up here that says.

269
00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:53.300
P5: trying to think of how it would be worded. But basically say, okay, we're looking for how your income changed from 2023 to 2024

270
00:24:54.512 --> 00:24:59.599
P5: something of that nature, because it's obvious. After I go through the whole thing. Okay, that's what we're looking for. But

271
00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:02.550
P5: you know, I had to kind of figure that out on my own. I guess.

272
00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:03.170
Hieu: Right.

273
00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:07.690
P5: That makes sense other than that. That's good.

274
00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:09.860
Hieu: Okay, we can continue.

275
00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:15.140
P5: Same with the spouses.

276
00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:21.969
P5: Okay, so that's basically the same thing. But for my spouse.

277
00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:32.668
P5: I know, I guess.

278
00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:46.220
P5: Is there a reason why they're saying, oh, here's what you you have for 2023. Now we need for 2024. Why, why, if I'm filling this form out, why do I even care what 2023 was.

279
00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:50.399
Hieu: So in your case you don't find this helpful at all.

280
00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:55.720
P5: Not really.

281
00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:56.350
Hieu: Okay.

282
00:25:56.654 --> 00:26:07.020
P5: Unless I just wanted to see. Hmm! You know. Is it more or less from last year again, because it did confuse me@firstst It's like, why are they asking? You know.

283
00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:15.820
P5: it's like they're asking for one thing here and then asking the same thing because I didn't notice 2023, 2024 I don't see that as being helpful.

284
00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:22.729
Hieu: Okay, you rather just have not have the 2023 reference.

285
00:26:23.503 --> 00:26:24.276
P5: Right?

286
00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:33.259
P5: yeah, I'd I'd I'd rather not have that it it to me. It is a little confusing

287
00:26:33.917 --> 00:26:39.569
P5: and I don't really see the the need for it and and the back on the back end there. Maybe there is a need for it.

288
00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:56.069
P5: But I would think that in my, you know, records in the Va. And the electronic records, 2023 is in there. So if if you guys needed to know the difference from 23 to 24 that could be done on the back end. I didn't need to see that.

289
00:26:56.850 --> 00:27:04.099
Hieu: But for yourself. If you're doing this with real information, you wouldn't find that ref. That 2023 reference to be helpful at all.

290
00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:09.190
P5: No, I don't think so. Yeah, I I don't. I don't see reason for it.

291
00:27:09.970 --> 00:27:10.880
P5: Yeah.

292
00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:12.540
Hieu: All right. We can continue there.

293
00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:18.060
P5: Okay? And it's just reviewing that information again.

294
00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:23.190
P5: Okay.

295
00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:34.869
Hieu: Okay, I'll stop you right there. So was there any part of that that was confusing to you? Besides, the the initial confusion of the

296
00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:37.730
Hieu: of gray box 2023. Reference.

297
00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:45.000
P5: Yeah, that was the main thing. Rest of it was pretty much the same as the other flow. You know. So.

298
00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:49.579
Hieu: And then how would you compare it to the previous flow? Do you have a preference for one or the other.

299
00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:51.669
P5: The the 1st flow, the green.

300
00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:54.059
Hieu: You, you like the 1st flow more? Yeah, right?

301
00:27:55.510 --> 00:28:04.450
Hieu: And then on a scale of one to 5, 1 being very easy and 5 being very hard. How hard was it for you to complete at this financial section

302
00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:07.999
Hieu: information? If you're to do this with real information.

303
00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:24.339
P5: it's still one, because the the confusion, when we call it about the 2023 numbers didn't really hinder me completing the form it just kind of raised question in my mind. Other than that, you know, entering the information is easy.

304
00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:31.640
Hieu: Gotcha, and then can you press the back button here, scroll down, and then press the back right there.

305
00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:44.279
Hieu: and in this scenario. The expense for your deductible is also for your medical expense is also incorrect, so would this screen made it make it easier to catch, or you don't think so.

306
00:28:44.826 --> 00:28:48.990
P5: I guess I should have caught it the 1st time.

307
00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:58.960
P5: This is, I guess, like giving me another chance to to say, Oh, wait a minute. No, that's not right. I did forget that rather than hitting back numerous times. Go all the way back.

308
00:28:59.360 --> 00:28:59.730
Hieu: Right.

309
00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:02.349
P5: You know, just hitting add here. So this this is good here.

310
00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:06.970
Hieu: Gotcha. And then, yeah, we can continue on here.

311
00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:07.580
P5: Okay.

312
00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:20.960
Hieu: And then on the in terms of the whole form for the second flow. Here on a difficulty scale of one through 5, 1 being very easy and 5 being very hard, how would you rate the overall form? You just went through.

313
00:29:21.787 --> 00:29:23.670
P5: Still probably one.

314
00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:29.929
Hieu: Okay, just because it's relatively straightforward as well.

315
00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:31.600
P5: Yes, right?

316
00:29:32.290 --> 00:29:35.089
Hieu: Gotcha, and then on a fish. Go ahead.

317
00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:52.869
P5: Well what I was saying, like I mentioned. I volunteer at the Va. Every Thursday, and a lot of I mean a lot of the veterans that come through just getting signed up on va day.gov things of that nature. They just have anything with the technology.

318
00:29:53.507 --> 00:30:11.719
P5: They really have a problem with. Now I'm I'm a retired systems engineer. So I know technology. And every now and then I have trouble with some of that stuff, not with this, but so I could see. You know, some of the the men and women having having problems. But you're you're

319
00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:15.940
P5: you're talking to me. So from my perspective. It's fine.

320
00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:26.249
Hieu: Okay, I got you. And then on an efficiency scale of one to 5, 1 being very efficient and 5 being very inefficient, how would you rate the formula you just went through.

321
00:30:27.205 --> 00:30:27.810
P5: One.

322
00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:34.900
Hieu: Okay. And then what was your? What is your overall thought of the 2 prototype we just went through.

323
00:30:35.902 --> 00:30:42.990
P5: The the 1st one, I think, was was simpler, not simpler to fill out, but

324
00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:51.589
P5: the second one, I think, had information on there that wasn't necessary, and and I could see somebody being confused by that, as I was initially.

325
00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:52.200
Hieu: Gotcha.

326
00:30:52.545 --> 00:30:55.310
P5: So the the 1st one was was simpler.

327
00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:59.339
Hieu: And then can you elaborate on the information that wasn't necessary.

328
00:30:59.987 --> 00:31:03.839
P5: The thing about 2023 versus 2024.

329
00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:05.830
Hieu: Gotcha. So it's that reference. One.

330
00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:09.470
P5: Yeah, and the and there was one other thing.

331
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:12.039
Hieu: You can go back if if you like.

332
00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:26.399
P5: I try to just remember I know the the thing about with my spouse information, the status being married. That wasn't confusing. But again, I'm just one of those it's like, why is that there? It's a little. Yeah.

333
00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:26.930
Hieu: Yeah.

334
00:31:27.890 --> 00:31:33.200
P5: I'm I'm all about making things simple. When you know an online gotcha and things.

335
00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:39.139
Hieu: And then I maybe the other one that you mentioned could be the independent.

336
00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:48.189
P5: Oh, yeah, yeah, where? Where? It said you could add, well, the the information was pre-filled.

337
00:31:48.791 --> 00:31:59.059
P5: except, you know, it came to the screen by dependent information. It says that I'll be able to enter the information. When I went to the next screen it was pre-filled.

338
00:31:59.372 --> 00:32:04.030
Hieu: But it's kind of all the other. Why didn't it just come up and say, Hey, here's what we have for your dependent.

339
00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:05.190
P5: Right.

340
00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:06.700
P5: Add more, you know, at that point.

341
00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:08.240
Hieu: It's like an extra screen for you.

342
00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:08.950
P5: Yes.

343
00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:16.060
Hieu: Gotcha that makes sense. And then of these 2 prototype, which one would you prefer to see on va.gov.

344
00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:17.520
P5: The 1st one.

345
00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:20.589
Hieu: The 1st one. Okay, that makes sense.

346
00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:24.649
Hieu: And then, is there anything that you would change about the whole form if you could.

347
00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:38.112
P5: Not that I can think of, because I know, like I said, I like things simple, but you can't have it too simple. It's where people miss things it. It definitely the

348
00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:44.360
P5: the way after the information is entered, and it says, Okay, let's review it. Here's what we have for you.

349
00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:49.149
P5: and you can either continue or edit that information. That's, I think, very important.

350
00:32:49.150 --> 00:32:49.940
Hieu: Gotcha.

351
00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:55.199
P5: The I think that. Oh, that's fine!

352
00:32:55.460 --> 00:33:03.950
Hieu: Okay? And then you can stop sharing. Now, I will share my own screen and ask you a couple of more questions before we enter the interview

353
00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:06.710
Hieu: so.

354
00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:09.860
P5: One question I've got is this

355
00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:18.340
P5: trying to think I had a question. My mind it just it went away. Is something like this going to

356
00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:20.290
P5: be there on va.gov.

357
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:22.110
Hieu: Yes.

358
00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:25.149
P5: And is it good? And is it gonna be like a

359
00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:31.239
P5: the 1st time you sign up? It's going to be there, and then, maybe annually to review.

360
00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:43.809
Hieu: It depends on. So it depends on your a lot of factors. But it's your disability rating your priority group just depends on who needs to fill it out.

361
00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:48.829
P5: Yeah, cause I could see that information would change from year to year.

362
00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:51.900
Hieu: Yeah. You know, I had one kid when I filled it out.

363
00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:59.749
P5: 3 years ago, but now I've got another one. So I need to update. I could see it like an annual review.

364
00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:02.780
Hieu: That's fair.

365
00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:07.799
Hieu: Okay, I have this set up. Now I'll share my screen here.

366
00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:10.519
Hieu: Do you see my screen.

367
00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:11.340
P5: I do?

368
00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:14.609
Hieu: Alrighty, and then let me know if I need to zoom in or out.

369
00:34:14.830 --> 00:34:15.919
P5: Yeah, you're fine. Right there.

370
00:34:15.929 --> 00:34:17.283
Hieu: Okay? So

371
00:34:18.129 --> 00:34:27.299
Hieu: so there's 3 options here displaying your personal information in different ways. Can you walk through your your thought here? And do you have a preference for which one you like best?

372
00:34:30.170 --> 00:34:35.559
P5: I kind of like the middle one with the box around it it. It

373
00:34:36.139 --> 00:34:39.409
P5: kind of draws my attention to it says, Hey, verify this.

374
00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:40.170
Hieu: Gotcha.

375
00:34:40.419 --> 00:34:51.709
P5: They all are kind of do it, because the one on the left is just. It's the same font and everything as the rest of it, and the one on the right with the gray box. To me gray does not say, Hey, look at this!

376
00:34:52.149 --> 00:34:53.869
P5: So I think the middle one.

377
00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:56.029
Hieu: Gotcha. All right. Thank you for that.

378
00:34:56.540 --> 00:35:03.329
Hieu: Makes sense in terms of the marital status here. Do you have a preference for one or the other.

379
00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:08.389
P5: Probably the one on the right.

380
00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:13.030
P5: because I can actually see all the I can see all the choices there before I

381
00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:17.549
P5: pick. I guess the other one that is, you know. Drop down

382
00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:26.229
P5: it to me. It's it's simpler. I don't. I can just click once. I don't have to click, because I assume I'd have to click twice on the one on the left.

383
00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:27.330
Hieu: Gotcha

384
00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:47.789
Hieu: that makes sense. And then for this scenario, let's say you're married, and then you have, you know, a spouse married, and then you come back to this form, but you're no longer married, for let's say you're either divorce or widow, and you change it from married to a divorce, and you get this screen, and then can you

385
00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:51.379
Hieu: kind of walk through the the process here.

386
00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:52.220
P5: Staff.

387
00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:54.640
Hieu: What does this message mean to you?

388
00:35:55.006 --> 00:36:03.799
P5: I. It means that if I'm divorced or widowed, then it's gonna do away with any information I put in there for my spouse

389
00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:09.319
P5: as as long as the Va. Thinks it's not necessary. Then I'm fine with that.

390
00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:11.930
Hieu: Okay. So it's not confusing to you.

391
00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:17.780
P5: No, no, I I would kind of well, I wouldn't say expect that, but it is good to know that

392
00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:19.260
P5: I wouldn't.

393
00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:23.920
P5: So if I. If I say keep, then it doesn't change my status.

394
00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:25.170
Hieu: That is correct.

395
00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:27.719
P5: Okay, yeah. So I'm yeah. That's that's fine.

396
00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:36.799
P5: Just so I it tells me that, hey? If you go through with this, then all the information is, gonna go away, which should be fine, I guess as long as you guys don't care, I don't care.

397
00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:37.840
Hieu: Okay.

398
00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:46.479
Hieu: Gotcha, thank you for that. And then we have one more here. So this is 2 different way for the financial information here.

399
00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:55.629
P5: Yeah, see that that goes to that on the right where it shows me from 2023,

400
00:36:55.830 --> 00:36:57.920
P5: I would say, Okay, who who cares.

401
00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:02.180
P5: So the one on the left is is clear.

402
00:37:05.596 --> 00:37:12.320
Hieu: You wouldn't use the reference for the No unless.

403
00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:18.209
P5: Cause. I would either know that already, or just like well, who cares?

404
00:37:18.853 --> 00:37:22.629
P5: I I just I don't see that as necessary information. So

405
00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:25.109
P5: I would say definite one on the left.

406
00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:27.940
Hieu: I gotcha all right. Thank you for that.

407
00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:31.989
Hieu: And then that kind of concludes the

408
00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:41.329
Hieu: prototype. And really the questions. Thank you for so much for going through the forms with me. Do you have any questions for me?

409
00:37:42.431 --> 00:37:49.599
P5: Not really it it hopefully. What I've shared with you on what we've done is

410
00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:53.379
P5: will help. Because, like I said, that's I just see.

411
00:37:53.820 --> 00:38:14.200
P5: I hear, too. I see too many people that are very confused trying to fill out forms the online forms with the Va. And especially, you know, because a lot of us, I mean, I'm 70. But we've got guys from the Second World War that come in, and they don't have a clue how to do anything online. They've never owned a computer. Someone don't have a cell phone.

412
00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:15.770
Hieu: Right.

413
00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:26.709
P5: So you know, they just get. I can understand them being very and plus a lot of people are just so afraid of technology, even if something's really simple, they're just. I can't do that.

414
00:38:26.890 --> 00:38:27.740
Hieu: Right, right.

415
00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:29.050
P5: Yeah, I, try it.

416
00:38:29.410 --> 00:38:30.240
P5: Yeah.

417
00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:47.529
Hieu: Yeah, I really appreciate your feedback. I want to see if my colleagues have any questions. But other than that, I would like to circle back and reconfirm that you are comfortable. If we were to share, you know, a clip of this session with our Va. Partners.

418
00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:48.740
P5: That's fine!

419
00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:55.230
Hieu: Okay. And then, just to remind you, if we do choose to share it, we'll remove any kind of identifying information before sharing them

420
00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:57.420
Hieu: the clip. And then

421
00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:09.870
Hieu: like, I said, we really appreciate you taking your time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is really helpful for us to kind of continue making the website better and making sure it works for all veterans.

422
00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:11.904
P5: Yeah, well, I appreciate what you guys are doing.

423
00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:25.290
Hieu: And then, lastly, Prigian will send you like a thank you. Notice, with a little blurb, that you can pass along to other veterans, that you may know, to provide them with a chance to participate in future studies.

424
00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:26.400
P5: Okay.

425
00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:29.809
Hieu: All right. Thank you again. Enjoy the rest of your day.

426
00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:32.850
P5: You, too. Thank you very much, but.

427
00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:33.920
Hieu: Bye-bye.
