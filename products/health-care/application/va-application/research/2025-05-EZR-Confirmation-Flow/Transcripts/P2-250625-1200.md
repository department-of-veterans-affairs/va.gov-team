1
00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:09.230
Hieu: Okay, I have started the recording. I'd like to confirm that you are comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today.

2
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:10.210
P2: Yes.

3
00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:18.809
Hieu: And then, if you're comfortable, we decide to use a recorded clip of our discussion today to share with our Va partners.

4
00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:20.120
P2: Yes.

5
00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:28.839
Hieu: Alrighty. Thank you for that. And all the kind of technical stuff is out of the way. And then now we'll start with our warm up questions.

6
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.840
Hieu: Do you have a service-connected disability rating at the Va.

7
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:34.920
P2: I do?

8
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.869
Hieu: What is your disability rating.

9
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.960
P2: 100% plus.

10
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.080
Hieu: Okay? And then, have you recently visited the va.gov.

11
00:00:46.134 --> 00:00:50.810
P2: Depends on your definition of recently, I would say, within the last 60 days.

12
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.909
Hieu: Okay, so that's pretty recent. And then may I ask for what reason.

13
00:00:55.752 --> 00:01:03.260
P2: I was directed to upload some medical information as part of a exam.

14
00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:08.919
Hieu: Oh, okay, thank you for that. And then we'll jump right into our

15
00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:17.799
Hieu: kind of 2 prototype. So today you'll go through 2 different prototype. One is an option red, and one is an option green.

16
00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:36.619
Hieu: Imagine that you have a spouse and one dependent, and then you have filled out a similar form before. But now they're asking you to update your financial information in this scenario. You logged into your va.gov account where the system has pre-filled some of your information.

17
00:01:38.373 --> 00:01:44.009
Hieu: For this and for this scenario. Are you comfortable with sharing your screen and talking through the process.

18
00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:45.610
P2: I am.

19
00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.909
Hieu: Okay, let me kind of give you a link to go to.

20
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:53.630
Hieu: And then.

21
00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:03.149
Hieu: once that is loaded, please close out any kind of personal information like email, Facebook, before you share your screen.

22
00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:04.949
P2: Oh, all right.

23
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.760
Hieu: And let me know if you have any trouble, and I'll see if I can troubleshoot things with you as well.

24
00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.179
P2: Okay. I got the screen up. I don't know if you could see it or not.

25
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.130
Hieu: I do not. So in your zoom screen you'll have to do like a shared screen option.

26
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.490
P2: Okay, hold on just a second, please.

27
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:53.250
Hieu: Sure thing.

28
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.440
P2: Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.

29
00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.590
Hieu: Sorry I didn't catch that.

30
00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.370
P2: I'm sorry. I I knew to hit share that obviously would help with it.

31
00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.440
Hieu: Okay, I see it. It says you are sharing screen.

32
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.020
Hieu: Yeah. And then, yep, okay, perfect.

33
00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:29.590
Hieu: And then for today, let's start with, if you scroll down a little bit

34
00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.419
Hieu: you'll see that there's 2 options, the option red and option green. Let's start with the red option.

35
00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:36.463
P2: All right.

36
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:46.139
Hieu: So please take a few moments to go through this page, and I like you to think out loud as much as possible, noting anything confusing.

37
00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.369
P2: Okay? Well, obviously, if I'm doing this, it would say I'm already signed in, not signed in right? So.

38
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.850
Hieu: Yeah.

39
00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.110
P2: I'll you know, forego any of that. I'm certainly not going to

40
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.730
P2: catch any spelling errors, because I'm not an English major.

41
00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.689
P2: okay, application. Id number is obviously a different number than

42
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.789
P2: my Va. Id number. So I get that.

43
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.620
Hieu: Do want to note that for this scenario you you are Riley Smith.

44
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.752
P2: Check. I got it.

45
00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.380
P2: I appreciate you giving me a few years back on my life.

46
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.149
Hieu: While he's a youngster.

47
00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:37.590
Hieu: and then.

48
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.410
P2: So it gives me a way to

49
00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.840
P2: if the personal information is wrong, I could. I see you can

50
00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:49.399
P2: update here. So okay, I got that all right.

51
00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.629
P2: Tells me it's been saved or you'll save. It

52
00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:01.680
P2: gives me a lot of information on help and the feedback. Okay, nothing remarkable. Here. I get it.

53
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.540
Hieu: Okay.

54
00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:07.890
P2: Standard. I gotta go through it before I can continue. So I hit continue. I'm assuming.

55
00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:17.320
Hieu: Yep. As I mentioned before in this scenario, this information comes from previous information. You've provided so, and then you can click. Continue here.

56
00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:18.550
P2: Okay.

57
00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:25.839
Hieu: And then for your for research purposes, you're going through this form to make sure the fill-in are, you know, accurate and make sense.

58
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:35.009
P2: Okay. So I'm still in one of 3. So maybe a continued here would help.

59
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:41.180
P2: because I was assuming on the past screen one of 3. When I hit continue I would go to 2 of 3.

60
00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.469
P2: But nothing, Major, just a small suggestion.

61
00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.570
Hieu: I see. Thank you for that.

62
00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:48.619
P2: All right.

63
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.379
P2: Interesting that the mailing address is different from the home address in this particular case. But I get it.

64
00:05:59.813 --> 00:06:06.526
P2: Home phone. That seems to be a little dated. But I guess people still have a home phone.

65
00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.439
P2: I haven't had one in years.

66
00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:15.130
P2: Okay, nothing else. Hit continue.

67
00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:16.979
Hieu: Okay. Yep. Go ahead.

68
00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.530
P2: Okay. So now I'm in 2 of 3. Got it.

69
00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.080
P2: Okay?

70
00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:39.320
P2: Appreciate the why we're asking. I think I probably already know the answer. But because I'm updating. But I get it

71
00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:46.959
P2: always good to have it married, divorced, separated, widowed. Never married. Okay, fair enough.

72
00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.660
P2: Pretty basic.

73
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:57.129
Hieu: Okay? And then let's pause right there. Now, let's say, if you're no longer married, what do you expect to happen when you choose one of the other status.

74
00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:04.860
P2: Probably gives me a screen that would indicate when when it became in effect, or

75
00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:08.529
P2: in the case of divorce, when it was finalized.

76
00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:14.679
Hieu: So you expect some kind of timeframe kind of confirming that that whole ordeal.

77
00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:23.240
P2: Yeah, if I'm updating information, I'm obviously updating marital status. If it was married then, obviously, now, something has changed. So

78
00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.780
P2: I would expect, yes, if I hit.

79
00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:33.420
P2: you know, never married, it would probably wonder what happened. Right? I would. I would wonder what happened.

80
00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:34.160
P2: It's like

81
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:39.130
P2: rest of it. I would assume that. Hey? I'm updating mirrorable status. So it's going to need to know

82
00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:44.219
P2: when the separation became went into effect and or when the divorce

83
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:52.970
P2: was finalized in the case of the widowed, obviously probably would ask a date of deceased. Because, again.

84
00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:59.590
P2: if it's Va. Benefits and Va. Benefits are tied to marital status with. Obviously.

85
00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:03.190
P2: I think you said married, and one child in this scenario.

86
00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:04.680
Hieu: That is correct.

87
00:08:05.469 --> 00:08:11.559
P2: Obviously, if I'm no longer married, then that's going to affect obviously the benefits.

88
00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:16.080
Hieu: I see. So you it is tied to the benefits for you.

89
00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:19.410
Hieu: Okay? And then we can continue here.

90
00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:20.650
P2: All right.

91
00:08:24.213 --> 00:08:32.690
P2: Again. Just if I'm staying in the same classification. One of 3, 2 of 3, you know, continued, probably helps

92
00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:40.479
P2: okay, there's a back key in case I made a mistake.

93
00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:49.030
P2: I'm assuming Jordan is my wife.

94
00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.379
Hieu: Yes, in this scenario.

95
00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:57.640
P2: Or Riley is me, so I guess I could be a girl, and this could be a guy I've been. But anyway.

96
00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:08.064
P2: I don't. I don't. I don't need any. Obviously there would not be any need to explain. Jordan is a male or female. If I'm married, I probably already know.

97
00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:14.570
P2: All right. Appreciate to finish this form later. Always good to have that.

98
00:09:15.849 --> 00:09:19.689
P2: I'm assuming this screen times out after some amount of time.

99
00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:22.520
Hieu: Okay.

100
00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:34.720
P2: If it's saying, finish this form later. So I don't think that has to be necessarily advertised. I would say, if it's a very short timeframe. In other words, if you're only giving me.

101
00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:40.080
P2: you know a minute, say, you know, to do any edits before I hit. Continue

102
00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:46.330
P2: some type of countdown clock or heads up would be appreciated. You know how things tend to get on.

103
00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:59.930
P2: you know, logging off people. If there's inactivity, but I don't think it has to be necessarily said, unless I mean, if it's, you know, 5 min, I think that's probably sufficient time. I don't know what

104
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:04.940
P2: the industry standard might be, or even could be. But if

105
00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:12.300
P2: if you're only giving me a few seconds before entering, I would appreciate knowing that in case. I had a.

106
00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:15.929
P2: you know. Stop here real fast, get a drink of water or something.

107
00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:19.930
Hieu: So if if it's like a short timeframe, you want a timer.

108
00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:27.579
P2: Yeah, I mean, if maybe even a countdown clock said, Hey, if you don't respond or hit continue in the next 30 seconds, you're gonna get

109
00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:32.199
P2: logged off would be helpful.

110
00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:34.690
Hieu: Gotcha back.

111
00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:37.459
P2: So maybe a warning. But if that's

112
00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:43.740
P2: if that's not the case, then probably not necessarily, you know, just anyway, stream of consciousness. Think it out loud.

113
00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:44.260
Hieu: Right, right.

114
00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:44.800
P2: Thank you.

115
00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:45.620
Hieu: For that.

116
00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:48.109
P2: Okay, and hit. Continue.

117
00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:50.030
Hieu: Yup, you can hit. Continue.

118
00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:52.430
P2: Okay?

119
00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:54.060
P2: Same thing.

120
00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:56.620
P2: Yeah.

121
00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:01.920
P2: Only up to 6. Huh? Okay, that's interesting.

122
00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.569
P2: That's an interesting number.

123
00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:09.819
P2: I'm not sure what that would be about in my case. Obviously it doesn't apply, since it's

124
00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:19.420
P2: a wife and a daughter or a child. So I'm assuming that's 2 in this case

125
00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:29.329
P2: up to 6 is is what I was. Just. It just caught my eye. I mean, I don't know what the reasoning behind that is so doesn't really matter to me.

126
00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:34.639
P2: Who we consider dependent. Good. Okay, nothing.

127
00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:40.770
P2: Nothing remarkable. Here, you said in this scenario. It's.

128
00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:43.400
Hieu: One dependent.

129
00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:46.529
P2: So then I would have to add a dependent.

130
00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:47.710
Hieu: Yes, that is correct.

131
00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:51.039
P2: So I'm assuming. If I hit, continue, it'll show me

132
00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.350
P2: if it's my dependent, or if I'm adding.

133
00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:59.360
Hieu: Right so you can hit. Yep, you can hit it. Continue.

134
00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.220
P2: All right.

135
00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:03.280
P2: Okay.

136
00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:10.370
P2: yeah. Nothing remarkable here, I would say.

137
00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:18.353
P2: As of maybe you know

138
00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:29.260
P2: there, it's at it, and it's asking me person in obviously status, and

139
00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:32.100
P2: I don't know what else I would edit

140
00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:37.799
P2: date of birth, or maybe not date of birth, or you know, when I claimed it.

141
00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:41.540
P2: you know, claimed as of whatever date might help.

142
00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:42.750
Hieu: Right.

143
00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:52.240
P2: Otherwise. If if my dependent is deceased

144
00:12:55.120 --> 00:13:02.500
P2: or is no longer a dependent, I guess I hit Delete, so I don't know.

145
00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.200
Hieu: Okay, so in your.

146
00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.380
P2: And there might you might wanna

147
00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:16.550
P2: I mean, I'm adding the dependent. Or I'm reviewing my dependents. There might need to be something in there on.

148
00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:22.620
P2: I mean, cause you asked if my marital status was different. Upfront.

149
00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:29.460
P2: You know it. It showed married, obviously, but it gave me the options of, you know, widowed and divorced.

150
00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:37.540
P2: I don't know how you would want to handle a case of deceased.

151
00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:39.300
Hieu: Gotcha.

152
00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:43.450
P2: But that's again just stream of consciousness.

153
00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:45.490
Hieu: Right? Right? Thank you for that.

154
00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:47.190
Hieu: Then we can move on.

155
00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:55.260
P2: Enrolled in school seems a little bit

156
00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:04.630
P2: vague. I'm assuming enrolled in school, meaning after they've graduated high school

157
00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:10.780
P2: up to 23 to be at a college or university, or something, I'm sure.

158
00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:18.510
P2: Okay, I mean, I I don't know the the rules on this, you know, you obviously all do. But

159
00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:23.129
P2: I appreciate the short primer that helps. Okay. You want me to continue.

160
00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:24.080
Hieu: Yes, please.

161
00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:41.659
P2: Okay, I'm assuming. Yes, since that's what we're doing.

162
00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:48.389
Hieu: Yeah, so that is for this scenario. We are updating the financial information. So that is correct.

163
00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:53.132
P2: Okay that presumes prior knowledge on my part.

164
00:14:54.300 --> 00:15:01.609
P2: I don't know if you need to explain that, you know, if there's no change from 2023. Then you do not have to add, I mean, I

165
00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:08.740
P2: I don't know this video to to answer that question before I go to the next screen and actually see

166
00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:10.580
P2: what's in the system.

167
00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:14.220
P2: Seems a little problematic.

168
00:15:15.505 --> 00:15:16.680
Hieu: Can you expand on that.

169
00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:23.129
P2: Yeah. So I'm thinking, you know, in the previous screens.

170
00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:30.889
P2: I see the methodology, you know. Are you married? Yes, continue. It shows me who I'm married to

171
00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:36.479
P2: do. You have dependents? Yes, hit continue. It shows me who I have as a dependent.

172
00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:40.269
P2: This is slightly different, I think, in

173
00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:44.339
P2: you know, cause if I don't know what's in your system.

174
00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:50.409
P2: it's going to be hard for me to answer. Do I have income or deductible expenses to add.

175
00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:53.810
P2: unless I'm having to do this every year.

176
00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:56.319
P2: I don't know if that makes any sense. But.

177
00:15:56.753 --> 00:15:57.619
Hieu: It does.

178
00:15:57.620 --> 00:15:59.969
P2: Quick, maybe a quick screen that

179
00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:02.919
P2: you know. Here's what's in the system.

180
00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:15.010
P2: Now, do you have income or deductible expenses to add, then I can answer yes or no. I you know I I see what you're doing. I'm not trying to shoot holes in it, but I'm just giving you kind of a

181
00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:17.660
P2: 1st gut reaction is.

182
00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:18.520
Hieu: Right.

183
00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:22.920
P2: I don't know the answer to this, because I don't know.

184
00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:26.050
P2: I'd have to see what's in the system. I guess.

185
00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:31.610
Hieu: Gotcha, and then, you know, we don't mind you. Shooting holds in it. I think that's the whole point of this.

186
00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:39.790
P2: Yeah, I don't even know if I'm shooting holes. I get methodology, as you're saying. But it's it's kind of a different question. Yeah, because.

187
00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:44.819
P2: yeah, yeah, I, personally, I would like to see what you got.

188
00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:46.540
P2: You know, quick screen.

189
00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:49.210
P2: Here's what you've got in the system.

190
00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:54.940
P2: Now you have to add, or no question would make sense to me.

191
00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:56.970
Hieu: Okay. Hit. Continue.

192
00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:58.170
Hieu: Yes. Please.

193
00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:05.600
P2: Okay. So yeah, here's what I've got in the system.

194
00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:08.140
Hieu: So for.

195
00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:09.220
P2: This session.

196
00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:29.119
Hieu: I will give you the financial information that you'll need, and then for this scenario, you and your spouse's work and salary has not changed from 2,023 to 2,024. And then the information I'm pacing is just for your reference. It doesn't really. You don't really need it for the demo. But

197
00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:36.419
Hieu: you know, in reality is you'll have this information outside, like Irs, or some kind of

198
00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:45.479
Hieu: like a w 2 or something like that, and then you can use that as a reference while you're filling this information out.

199
00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:51.929
P2: Sure I mean nothing, nothing unusual. There, you have to do it as part of, you know, even credit or loan applications. So you.

200
00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:52.510
Hieu: Right.

201
00:17:53.189 --> 00:17:55.469
P2: I would say that.

202
00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:00.569
Hieu: If I've clicked on making a change for 2024.

203
00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:09.060
P2: And there is no change. My having to enter 62,400, which is the same as last year, is a little irritating.

204
00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:12.199
P2: I mean, if there's no change, then

205
00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:18.059
P2: you're asking me to enter the same information that's not changed.

206
00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:18.400
Hieu: I got.

207
00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:19.589
P2: That makes sense.

208
00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:25.699
Hieu: Yes, so you want it like, if it's no change like there's a no change option or a no change button.

209
00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:34.080
P2: Yeah, I think I'm not sure how to do your design. And I know I'm causing a problem here. But I I would say.

210
00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:43.760
P2: either pre-populate this, in other words, combine the 2 and say, you know, gross income for 2023

211
00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:50.990
P2: is unchanged. Hit, continue, or you know again pre-populated.

212
00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:55.030
P2: you know, 62,400, so I don't have to enter it.

213
00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:55.920
Hieu: There's no chair.

214
00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:56.570
P2: Ratings.

215
00:18:56.710 --> 00:19:01.729
P2: I mean, why do I enter the same number that if it hasn't changed, that's all I'm getting at.

216
00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:14.539
Hieu: I think. In this scenario it's you your personally, there's no change. But I don't think this. At least in this scenario. The system doesn't know if you changed or not.

217
00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:18.380
P2: Sure I understand that I'm just saying, from my perspective.

218
00:19:19.095 --> 00:19:27.140
P2: You're I'm being asked to enter the same number as what's already in there. So that's a little bit of an irritant.

219
00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:28.120
Hieu: I gotcha.

220
00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:34.000
P2: But okay, so you. So I enter 62,400 here.

221
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.630
Hieu: Yeah, can you just click on that? And then.

222
00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:40.309
P2: Oh, okay, well, that's you know. So if it's just an automatic.

223
00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:43.299
P2: Oh, I got it. Functionality. Okay?

224
00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:45.330
P2: All right.

225
00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:54.089
Hieu: I do want to note that. That's not how the system work is, just for our demo purposes. It's just filled in automatically.

226
00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:58.144
P2: Yeah, I appreciate you saying it. That's what I just went through in my mind, but did say.

227
00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:00.950
P2: Oh, yeah, I got it.

228
00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:04.549
P2: So you want me to enter? 47, 7, 98. Here.

229
00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:06.150
Hieu: Yes, that is correct.

230
00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:09.640
P2: Alright. That is kind of handy, though just

231
00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:14.570
P2: I, you know, getting back to what we previously discussed. If it is unchanged.

232
00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:21.740
P2: if I just take, you know, if I just hit it, and it puts that last number in. That's kind of handy, I guess.

233
00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:23.110
Hieu: Oh, I gotcha so.

234
00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:23.850
P2: Maybe just.

235
00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:24.620
Hieu: Function.

236
00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:28.037
P2: Yeah. Or maybe just, you know, put that in your your

237
00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:32.489
P2: you know, if I change, just hit, enter, and it'll

238
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.909
P2: you know it'll do it for you, I guess.

239
00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:35.670
Hieu: Right.

240
00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:36.720
P2: Yeah, just a thought.

241
00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:45.100
P2: Okay? And wow, no other income. That's not good. All right, save, okay?

242
00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:49.079
P2: Again, appreciate. To finish the form later. This is one, that

243
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:53.080
P2: this one may be one that times out because

244
00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:55.600
P2: I may have to go in and

245
00:20:55.870 --> 00:21:00.149
P2: think about it. I may not have all written it down in preparation for this. So

246
00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:04.739
P2: if I'm not prepared, or if I'm just being incompetent myself.

247
00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:08.370
P2: I may wind up spending some time on this. So

248
00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:12.970
P2: your any time out clock might be important here.

249
00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:14.350
Hieu: I gotcha.

250
00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:19.829
P2: Cause. If if I'm doing this, I'm probably asking my wife.

251
00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:24.820
P2: Hey, what did you do on our farm property or business? And hey, what about that

252
00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:29.860
P2: yard sale you had? I'm just being facetious here a little bit, but

253
00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:32.589
P2: I probably haven't ask her for help. Okay,

254
00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:41.740
P2: alright, it's telling me. It's saved. I'm assuming the saved hits

255
00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:47.870
P2: at some point in the process, or does it say when I hit? Continue.

256
00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:50.140
Hieu: What do you think?

257
00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:55.470
P2: I I'm assuming it saves when I hit continue. But

258
00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:57.790
Hieu: Okay.

259
00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:01.839
P2: I, you know that might be something if

260
00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:07.570
P2: if I put a number in here and it I had to finish the form later, or something.

261
00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:11.959
P2: If I come back, and that number is no longer in there. I'm going to be a little irritated.

262
00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:13.110
Hieu: Gotcha.

263
00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:20.280
P2: So I'm assuming that it would save if I click out, either continue back or finish this form. But

264
00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:22.529
P2: that's your expectation.

265
00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:26.499
P2: That would be my assumption. Yeah, my expectation is.

266
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:37.750
P2: I'm I'm a cynical guy, so you know my expectation personally is, it isn't saving, you know. So better be sure what what I'm doing, but.

267
00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:38.645
Hieu: Right.

268
00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:40.920
P2: Cause. That's.

269
00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:41.310
Hieu: Fair.

270
00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:46.499
P2: Too many times. But yeah, so I mean, I think assumption would be. It saves

271
00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:49.369
P2: as I move on to the next screen.

272
00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:53.270
Hieu: Right, and then we can continue to the next screen.

273
00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:54.610
P2: Okay.

274
00:22:58.110 --> 00:23:09.330
P2: Yeah. Alright, yeah. Here's so maybe a warning that before I go into household information is.

275
00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:11.889
P2: Hey, you're gonna need to know.

276
00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:17.650
P2: So have all your information readily handy, or something might help.

277
00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:25.569
P2: I mean, I I should presume that if I'm entering, you know financial information, I should know mine, my spouse's.

278
00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:29.290
P2: and all these others.

279
00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:30.240
Hieu: Right.

280
00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:36.210
P2: I'm presuming I would not have to enter in stuff that my dependent brings in

281
00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:41.030
P2: to the house, but that may be part of it. So just maybe a little bit of a warning up front.

282
00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:41.970
Hieu: Okay, so.

283
00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:42.480
P2: I know.

284
00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:43.259
Hieu: Yes, sir.

285
00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:51.319
P2: Yeah, yeah, that's great. I technical term. I've learned it all right. Just hit enter.

286
00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:52.200
Hieu: Yes.

287
00:23:53.840 --> 00:24:02.270
P2: All right, my spouse. Better get busy. She's weight don't don't share that.

288
00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:05.180
P2: Okay, hit continue.

289
00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:06.520
Hieu: Yes, please.

290
00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:15.529
P2: Okay, so nothing about the dependent bringing in money. That's fine. I guess I

291
00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:20.830
P2: I would not expect to have to enter that, but I'm sure there was

292
00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:25.449
P2: that was thought out. It may.

293
00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:32.220
P2: I don't know. There may need to be some any other income

294
00:24:34.162 --> 00:24:39.379
P2: you wish to enter, I mean before I got to this screen might help.

295
00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:44.220
Hieu: Okay. So you're thinking there should be more type income types.

296
00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:51.019
P2: So if I've got my dependent in my own personal case I did. She just obviously turned

297
00:24:51.370 --> 00:24:53.739
P2: past that age.

298
00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:58.839
P2: But does work and does get income.

299
00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:07.330
P2: Now, whether I want to include that here or not, I'm sure, is up to me. But if there's

300
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:16.129
P2: a requirement to report what the financial information is to include what a dependent brings into the house.

301
00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:19.210
P2: you know, you might want to have that in here, or

302
00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:28.840
P2: just a mechanism here of. Is there any other income you wish to that was not covered, gab

303
00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:38.220
P2: you? Well, farm property, I guess it all is pretty much covered up. I can't even tell you a scenario, so maybe just disregard what I'm saying. But

304
00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:42.839
P2: I guess what I was getting at is, you know, we're now going in expenses. So

305
00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:47.269
P2: we covered income. I would have expected there be any.

306
00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:51.670
P2: you know. Is there any other income you wish to report or add.

307
00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:54.190
Hieu: Before I got to this screen.

308
00:25:54.190 --> 00:26:00.519
Hieu: Right? You're saying, since you have a dependent, you're expecting, like a dependent income portion as well.

309
00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:05.999
P2: Yeah, I guess what I'm saying is is, there's usually kind of a hey, you know.

310
00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:09.959
P2: Is there anything here that we may not have covered that you want to add.

311
00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:16.709
P2: And before I said that to you I was trying to think in my mind what a scenario possibly could be. And so I grabbed onto the

312
00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:18.799
P2: the dependent. So.

313
00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:19.400
Hieu: Gotcha.

314
00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:24.310
P2: Again, not knowing you know the rules fully on that.

315
00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:24.790
Hieu: Right.

316
00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:25.470
P2: But.

317
00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:32.749
Hieu: You want, like a catch, all or other income that the form hasn't listed.

318
00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:37.579
P2: Yeah, I think that might be prudent, you know. Anyway, something to think about.

319
00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:39.609
Hieu: Okay, yeah, thank you for that feedback.

320
00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:42.920
P2: Okay, entering the expenses.

321
00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:51.050
P2: Well, we would have been very helpful, good, healthy $500 and non reimbursable. That's

322
00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:56.239
P2: it's not bad. College or vocational.

323
00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:59.774
P2: Oh, no, that's crazy. Sorry.

324
00:27:00.677 --> 00:27:03.799
Hieu: Is that expensive, or is that inexpensive to you.

325
00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:05.690
P2: I wouldn't expecting you.

326
00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:07.500
Hieu: Come on!

327
00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:09.749
P2: I mean, all right.

328
00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:15.059
P2: That's barely continuing edge for for a realtor. But anyway,

329
00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:23.459
P2: okay. So yeah. So you've asked here if spouse or dependent child died.

330
00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:25.110
P2: But I don't see that.

331
00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:32.099
P2: Oh, you said widowed. So that that was under marital status. But there wasn't under dependent child

332
00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:38.630
P2: recording death. But okay, glad we still have everybody hit. Continue.

333
00:27:39.157 --> 00:27:40.630
Hieu: Not yet. Take a pause

334
00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:43.009
Hieu: here, and then I'm going to ask you a few questions. Here.

335
00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:43.510
P2: Oh, okay.

336
00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:51.810
Hieu: So was any of this confusing to you the fill in on any of the financial information portion.

337
00:27:51.810 --> 00:27:53.825
P2: No, nothing was confusing.

338
00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:59.480
P2: I mean I you know I I probably would have breezed right through this pretty quickly.

339
00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:02.660
P2: You know, it's

340
00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:09.289
P2: I mean, yeah. You know, you're asking this information for a reason. So I'm just, I'm gonna presume.

341
00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:14.040
P2: Then you've been very complete and done your due diligence on the questions.

342
00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:19.280
P2: If there's, you know, that's why I brought in, you know. Perhaps

343
00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:26.600
P2: you know that. Is there any other income you wish to report? Is there any other expenses you risk to report

344
00:28:26.890 --> 00:28:31.510
P2: outside of medical education and funeral.

345
00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:32.750
Hieu: Right.

346
00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:39.770
P2: Again, that's neither here nor there. Alright!

347
00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:51.560
Hieu: Now, when you saw the 2,023 financial numbers in the gray box, did it help you decide what to do next? Or does it make you second guess? What if it's current.

348
00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:58.510
P2: No, you've already said upfront, and I'm I'm gonna presume, in my mind. You know, that

349
00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:04.170
P2: I know what I put in for 2023, you know. So.

350
00:29:04.330 --> 00:29:13.349
P2: or I gonna know if I had funeral business expenses in 2023, if all of a sudden I see a 0 then. Yeah, now, I know there's a problem.

351
00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:22.050
P2: There's been a mistake in your system. Otherwise. Yeah, I'm probably gonna just blow right through this. Because

352
00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:26.413
P2: what I told you 2023 was completely accurate.

353
00:29:27.010 --> 00:29:39.250
Hieu: Okay, and then on a scale of one to 5, 1 being very easy and 5 being very difficult. How difficult was it for you to complete this financial information section.

354
00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:42.160
Hieu: real information.

355
00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:45.029
P2: For real, I would say. Probably

356
00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:48.030
P2: you know a a 2, probably because

357
00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:52.590
P2: if there were changes, it's gonna take me a while to compile all the information.

358
00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:59.359
Hieu: So the information is not difficult or to go through, but it was more of a time consuming process. Then.

359
00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:02.758
P2: Yeah, I mean, there's got to be preparation time.

360
00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:08.180
P2: you know, cause other or otherwise, I'm gonna be hunting. And you know.

361
00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:13.439
P2: okay, what did I make you know? Let me go back, pull my pay stub from that year.

362
00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:19.270
P2: So I have to go on another screen, you know, because I don't have paper pay stubs anymore. Right?

363
00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:20.840
P2: Gotcha. Yeah, Adam.

364
00:30:21.050 --> 00:30:26.289
P2: what was funeral expenses that we paid out 2024. I need to go find the

365
00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:28.079
P2: you know that?

366
00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:34.082
P2: Oh, wow! I don't know. Do I guess funeral homes give invoices right?

367
00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:35.040
Hieu: Right.

368
00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:37.480
P2: Sorry I haven't had to pay for a funeral

369
00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:40.760
P2: very expensive, so I'd have to go find that information

370
00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:45.059
P2: unless you told me upfront to have it readily available, because you're going to ask.

371
00:30:47.370 --> 00:30:54.740
P2: Even so, you know. That's why I may say a 2, as you know, fairly easy.

372
00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:55.380
Hieu: Right.

373
00:30:55.380 --> 00:31:01.450
P2: You know, but as far as you know, your screen dynamic and navigating it through, it's certainly a 1.

374
00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:06.039
P2: Okay, very straight forward. I mean it's it's not difficult at all.

375
00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:18.749
Hieu: Right? Okay, thank you for that. And then I know you mentioned earlier with the kind of no change flow. Do you have any additional feedback or suggestions for this page to kind of make the update quicker for you.

376
00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:22.010
P2: No.

377
00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:24.389
Hieu: Okay, then that is okay.

378
00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:28.870
Hieu: We will move on to the next portion. So please click, continue.

379
00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:41.019
P2: Okay, so recap screen of what I've done. Good. Okay.

380
00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:55.030
Hieu: Okay? And then in this scenario, you realize that one of your expense was incorrect. You had a big out of pocket dental operation last year of $3,000. How would you fix that error.

381
00:31:56.160 --> 00:32:01.860
P2: 1st off, I would probably ask you

382
00:32:02.450 --> 00:32:06.820
P2: in this screen any changes I made from 2023

383
00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:09.619
P2: would highlight in a different color.

384
00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:20.699
P2: So maybe you know, cause I'm you know, if I see the screen and I see, like the 1st couple numbers is the same as 2023. I may just kind of already go down to go

385
00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:25.649
P2: hit, continue but to answer your question.

386
00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:31.989
P2: that's gonna fall under. Non. Well, it's gonna fall under expenses. Medical expense. I'm assuming

387
00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:33.670
P2: you said it was how much.

388
00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:35.630
Hieu: $3,000.

389
00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:38.619
P2: Yeah. So I would hit Edit key and then

390
00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:44.009
P2: medical, I'll I'll assume, includes dental and vision. So yeah, I would

391
00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:46.900
P2: expect to hit edit go back in

392
00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:49.580
P2: change. What I put down for medical.

393
00:32:50.010 --> 00:33:00.149
Hieu: Okay, so that was pretty straightforward for you. And now can you move on? I think that's it, for now and then you can move on to the next screen. Here.

394
00:33:00.150 --> 00:33:01.380
P2: Hit, continue, okay.

395
00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:02.220
Hieu: Yes, please.

396
00:33:08.290 --> 00:33:13.470
P2: Okay. So it's telling me what you've saved, all right.

397
00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:20.450
P2: plus meaning. If I hit that, it'll obviously open that up

398
00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:28.809
P2: and household information I'm assuming is the again financial. I think previous screens it, said household financial information.

399
00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:29.740
Hieu: Yes.

400
00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:31.000
P2: So

401
00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:38.910
P2: I don't know if well, it's gonna be kind of hard, obviously, to fit all that into one screen area or block. But

402
00:33:41.170 --> 00:33:45.339
P2: if the previous screens have a banner, you know, saying that

403
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:51.259
P2: you know, step one step 2, I would say these should be the same as those

404
00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:53.789
P2: you don't understand what I'm saying.

405
00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:56.530
Hieu: Yeah, that's a nice catch on your part. By the way.

406
00:33:56.950 --> 00:33:59.280
P2: Okay, so hit one of these exit or.

407
00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:04.080
Hieu: Yes, let's let's say you're reviewing it for real.

408
00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:06.340
P2: A.

409
00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:25.929
P2: Oh, okay. So some new information here. Social. Okay, here's your date of birth marriage. Okay? So that's okay.

410
00:34:27.159 --> 00:34:30.630
P2: So I'm presuming. Then if I was adding

411
00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:40.600
P2: a dependent that all this information I would have had to enter. So okay.

412
00:34:42.989 --> 00:34:45.380
P2: good. Seems to be fairly complete.

413
00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:53.859
P2: Alright, can I? Can I go back for a second.

414
00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:58.599
Hieu: Yes, if you scroll down, and then there's a back button there.

415
00:34:58.860 --> 00:34:59.890
P2: Alright!

416
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.879
Hieu: How are you trying to go.

417
00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:06.270
P2: Yeah, I didn't know I I didn't want to go all the way back. I wanted to go to the

418
00:35:08.110 --> 00:35:09.399
P2: oh, I'm sorry.

419
00:35:10.610 --> 00:35:15.170
Hieu: Oh, you trying to go back just without the are you trying to collapse.

420
00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:15.940
P2: Yes.

421
00:35:16.210 --> 00:35:19.070
Hieu: I believe you can click it again, and it will collapse.

422
00:35:19.070 --> 00:35:23.429
P2: Oh, I see where it is. Go up here to this. So that's what I wanted to do.

423
00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:24.260
Hieu: Okay.

424
00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:26.109
P2: Okay, I got it. So

425
00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:39.710
P2: okay, I got you.

426
00:35:40.010 --> 00:35:43.600
Hieu: Okay. So and then we'll pause right there

427
00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:54.120
Hieu: and then on a difficulty scale of everything that you've done so far in this form, one being very easy, and then 5 being very hard, how would you rate the form you just went through.

428
00:35:55.690 --> 00:35:58.279
P2: Again. I think rating the form is the one.

429
00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:02.870
P2: Okay, there can't be any problem here. Oops. Sorry.

430
00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:05.200
Hieu: No.

431
00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:06.109
P2: Go ahead!

432
00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:15.170
Hieu: And then on an efficiency scale of one to 5, 1 being very efficient and 5 being very inefficient, how would you rate the form you just went through.

433
00:36:18.890 --> 00:36:22.699
P2: Oh, okay, that's a little bit of a loaded question. Efficiency?

434
00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:28.880
P2: To give you an honest answer.

435
00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:35.740
P2: I would say, it's it is very efficient. Presuming

436
00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:41.610
P2: all the information that you need and want and have to have is, is there? So?

437
00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:47.549
P2: I would say, yeah, within a 1 or 2 sure.

438
00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:49.550
Hieu: Okay, thank you for that.

439
00:36:50.010 --> 00:36:53.760
Hieu: And then for this portion, you can scroll down and

440
00:36:54.210 --> 00:36:57.430
Hieu: we'll end the scroll down some more.

441
00:36:59.580 --> 00:36:59.899
P2: All right.

442
00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:02.810
Hieu: End the red portion, so it will be end. The demo.

443
00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:14.490
P2: Okay? So that note is, if we're talking criminal penalties

444
00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:17.409
P2: may want to be a little bit more.

445
00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:22.439
P2: I mean, not threatening. But that's kind of good to know.

446
00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:28.669
P2: Withholding information on purpose.

447
00:37:30.190 --> 00:37:32.280
P2: 5 years. Okay? I mean, that's

448
00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:41.079
P2: normally on these type of things like anything. Usually, I think we all just kind of scroll down and go because we have to do it.

449
00:37:41.310 --> 00:37:45.990
P2: Yeah, when you talk like, you know the new agreement, for you know, I don't know

450
00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:52.540
P2: Internet Provider or whatever you know, it's almost like, yeah, okay. You know.

451
00:37:53.130 --> 00:37:55.729
P2: I'm just clicking because I got to do it.

452
00:37:55.730 --> 00:37:56.510
Hieu: Right.

453
00:37:57.260 --> 00:38:01.059
P2: If you know this is important. The Federal law piece may wanna.

454
00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:03.409
Hieu: Highlighted of some sort.

455
00:38:03.410 --> 00:38:04.989
P2: Or move it up. Front.

456
00:38:05.410 --> 00:38:06.290
Hieu: Okay.

457
00:38:06.290 --> 00:38:09.899
P2: Hey? Just so, you know. Make sure it's right.

458
00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:10.550
Hieu: Right.

459
00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:12.319
P2: I don't know. I don't know what

460
00:38:12.490 --> 00:38:16.659
P2: somebody would purposely be withholding information. That would be.

461
00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:21.550
P2: Well, I could. Yeah, never mind. I could see it.

462
00:38:22.610 --> 00:38:25.809
P2: I guess what I'm getting at is I don't know why somebody would withhold.

463
00:38:27.590 --> 00:38:29.818
P2: Well, never mind. Yeah, let's just

464
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.859
P2: not worth going through. Okay. So.

465
00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:33.530
Hieu: Okay.

466
00:38:33.839 --> 00:38:37.550
P2: I didn't check this box. I'm assuming if I hit it it.

467
00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:47.889
P2: Yeah. So maybe this is just your test. But I don't. I don't.

468
00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:52.140
P2: I don't expect to see a check mark in the box until I do it.

469
00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:56.800
Hieu: Right for demo purposes. Yeah, that does make sense

470
00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:59.479
Hieu: for the demo purposes. It's already pre-checked.

471
00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:03.919
P2: Oh, very good! Well, then, now I have a valid defense.

472
00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:10.990
Hieu: There are, so we can end this portion of the demo. You can go ahead and click end Demo. And then

473
00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:15.209
Hieu: so that was just that was the red option. And now we're gonna

474
00:39:15.370 --> 00:39:24.460
Hieu: move on to the green option. And in this option some of the screens will be the same, and some of it will be different. But you're going through, you know, a very similar flow.

475
00:39:24.830 --> 00:39:27.870
Hieu: Oh, the option green.

476
00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:29.329
P2: Okay. And then.

477
00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:33.840
Hieu: Like I mentioned earlier. You can talk out loud as you're going through this.

478
00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:42.200
P2: Okay, I don't. Wanna. I don't wanna waste all your time. So

479
00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:45.720
P2: maybe it highlights a little different. If

480
00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:51.310
P2: maybe it would help me if you tell me what the difference is that I'm looking for. In other words.

481
00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:55.619
P2: I'm assuming there's a change in option green to what I just went through.

482
00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:59.090
Hieu: Yeah, essentially, there's

483
00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:12.109
Hieu: no, no, it was more like you'll go through this the same way you did before. And then anything that stood out to you, or it's more confusing. This one or the other one, you know. Call that out.

484
00:40:12.110 --> 00:40:14.529
P2: Alright. So I'm gonna hit. Continue fairly quickly. Then.

485
00:40:14.530 --> 00:40:14.950
Hieu: Yes.

486
00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:15.320
P2: We'll pause.

487
00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:16.370
Hieu: That is correct.

488
00:40:16.650 --> 00:40:17.520
P2: All right.

489
00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:23.210
P2: Okay, I don't remember that one being an option. Red.

490
00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:30.139
P2: Was that an option? Red? That a little bit? Yeah. Okay. So

491
00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:37.389
P2: I guess that makes a difference. I don't know what that would be. But okay.

492
00:40:41.010 --> 00:40:43.920
P2: oh, wait a minute. That just I thought I hit continue.

493
00:40:44.070 --> 00:40:45.670
P2: Did I not hit? Continue.

494
00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:48.449
Hieu: Oh! Is that confusing to you.

495
00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:50.170
P2: Mailing address.

496
00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:56.821
P2: Home address. Okay, I'm sorry we're back into that alright

497
00:40:57.890 --> 00:41:03.109
P2: I'm assuming on mailing address. It's a there's a po box option.

498
00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:06.400
Hieu: That's your assumption. Okay?

499
00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:08.500
P2: Postal.

500
00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:10.599
P2: Yeah, is that postal box.

501
00:41:11.966 --> 00:41:14.319
Hieu: There's the postal code like Zip code.

502
00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:19.349
P2: Oh, zip code, okay, so probably ought to be zip cause. If it's a mailing address.

503
00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:23.389
P2: it may be a Po box.

504
00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:26.330
P2: If that is the case. I don't see.

505
00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:30.269
P2: Yeah, I don't see an option here.

506
00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:37.260
P2: So for me, for example, my home address, I may have a post office box that I have.

507
00:41:37.650 --> 00:41:40.340
P2: you know, personal business information going to.

508
00:41:40.510 --> 00:41:41.090
Hieu: Yeah.

509
00:41:41.090 --> 00:41:45.500
P2: And I may want you to send stuff to that post office box and not my home.

510
00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:49.319
P2: You already asked me if I live on a base. That's fine.

511
00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:54.650
P2: You might want to consider mailing address to include a post office

512
00:41:55.460 --> 00:42:03.499
P2: gotcha, and I'm assuming if it says I live on a base outside. It's an Apo or Fpo address format. So.

513
00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:05.240
P2: okay.

514
00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:06.329
Hieu: We can continue.

515
00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:11.980
P2: And this would be the home address. Got it.

516
00:42:12.210 --> 00:42:13.169
Hieu: Yep, and we can.

517
00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:15.630
P2: Now for military.

518
00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:23.500
P2: If I live on base that implies I don't have a home.

519
00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:26.300
P2: so I may still be using my home of record.

520
00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:31.369
P2: So well. This is for the veteran right.

521
00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:31.940
Hieu: Yes.

522
00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:36.639
P2: So I'm distributing. Okay, probably doesn't apply all right.

523
00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:38.890
Hieu: Then you can click, continue.

524
00:42:39.110 --> 00:42:45.239
P2: Yep, okay. I don't see any difference. There.

525
00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:47.470
Hieu: And then can you pause right here.

526
00:42:47.470 --> 00:42:48.080
P2: Yes.

527
00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:54.850
Hieu: So do you prefer to review your information page by page like this, or previously, like the card.

528
00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:57.490
Hieu: the summary cards, like.

529
00:42:57.490 --> 00:43:02.040
P2: Oh, I see what you're getting at. Yeah, I think, personally.

530
00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:04.230
P2: if I'm reviewing, I want to see it.

531
00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:05.050
Hieu: Yeah.

532
00:43:05.050 --> 00:43:07.120
P2: I don't want to go in and have to.

533
00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:11.560
P2: I don't know pig myself. In other words.

534
00:43:12.070 --> 00:43:17.490
P2: hey, here's what you put in. Has this changed is easier for me than to go in and go

535
00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:21.629
P2: well, as my yeah, bad example. But has my marital status changed.

536
00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:23.380
Hieu: Gotcha.

537
00:43:23.650 --> 00:43:26.080
P2: So, yeah, I think I kind of prefer that.

538
00:43:26.410 --> 00:43:30.449
Hieu: Gotcha. So it's more of the option red where you're seeing the summary, and then

539
00:43:30.810 --> 00:43:34.879
Hieu: and then you would like some kind of option that says, has it this change.

540
00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:36.210
P2: Yes.

541
00:43:36.210 --> 00:43:37.840
Hieu: Okay, we can move on.

542
00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:39.090
P2: Okay.

543
00:43:43.890 --> 00:43:47.330
P2: okay, so this is just okay. I see what you're doing.

544
00:43:54.110 --> 00:43:55.880
Hieu: Then, we can move on from here.

545
00:43:55.880 --> 00:44:00.389
P2: Yeah, this kind of this would be frustrating me if if there was no change.

546
00:44:01.370 --> 00:44:03.820
P2: I wouldn't want to go through all this.

547
00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:04.670
Hieu: Right.

548
00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:12.019
P2: I don't know what the what the

549
00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:23.230
P2: definition of this in this case, I mean, some is helpful. But yeah, if I'm having to do all of it. Then that's a little frustrating. Okay.

550
00:44:23.230 --> 00:44:24.190
Hieu: Gotcha.

551
00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:38.360
P2: Interesting. Okay.

552
00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:45.840
P2: yeah, I'm assuming this is building me up to.

553
00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:52.879
P2: I mean, did you live with your spouse for all or part of 2024,

554
00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:56.920
P2: if I was overseas on a job.

555
00:44:57.110 --> 00:45:00.100
P2: you know, for 6 months. How do I answer that.

556
00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:03.029
Hieu: Right. So you want more.

557
00:45:03.363 --> 00:45:11.260
P2: Yeah, I would say technically, I would probably just say yes, but you know I don't know.

558
00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:14.780
P2: Well, I guess I must get back to? What's the purpose of this question?

559
00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:19.699
P2: Did you live with your spouse for all a part of 2024? In other words, what are you trying to lead to

560
00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:23.939
P2: if I say no, what does that take me to.

561
00:45:24.110 --> 00:45:24.950
Hieu: Right.

562
00:45:25.541 --> 00:45:31.348
P2: If it's asking, okay, is it because they're deceased? That's a little insensitive. But I get it.

563
00:45:31.930 --> 00:45:35.990
P2: The I don't know just thought behind that.

564
00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:40.090
Hieu: Gotcha, and we can continue.

565
00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:52.359
P2: Oh, okay, that's a new one. I don't remember that in option. Red.

566
00:45:56.630 --> 00:46:01.880
P2: Yeah, I don't, unless I've given you information.

567
00:46:03.130 --> 00:46:07.409
P2: Seeing this question would just be frustrating to me.

568
00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:13.190
Hieu: So you didn't expect this question at all.

569
00:46:13.390 --> 00:46:17.449
P2: Yeah, I mean, well, this one kind of gets into. What are we talking about here?

570
00:46:17.740 --> 00:46:23.550
P2: Are we talking about alimony? Well, then, that would have assumed, you know, divorce.

571
00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:28.939
P2: If nothing has changed on the spouse, then

572
00:46:30.430 --> 00:46:33.629
P2: why am I being asked this question? And then.

573
00:46:34.821 --> 00:46:40.309
P2: did I provide financial support, I mean, even though you did not live together.

574
00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:42.449
P2: That's a pretty.

575
00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:45.850
P2: That's a pretty bold question, I guess.

576
00:46:46.990 --> 00:46:51.609
P2: I guess. Gets down to what what you're asking it for.

577
00:46:51.870 --> 00:46:57.600
Hieu: And then, if you're confused or wanting more information, how would you kind of search for that.

578
00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:03.979
P2: I you know what I probably would have just

579
00:47:04.130 --> 00:47:06.289
P2: blowing your question off and hit no.

580
00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:07.040
Hieu: Okay.

581
00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:09.060
P2: Because it's frustrating to me.

582
00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:10.160
Hieu: Right.

583
00:47:10.441 --> 00:47:15.219
P2: Cause. I'm not sure what we're talking about, you know. Are we talking a threshold limit here?

584
00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:18.199
P2: Did I give my spouse.

585
00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:26.059
P2: you know $20 to buy yourself. You know. Something from Starbucks today is that considered financial support.

586
00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:32.550
P2: Even though you didn't live together, that's now opening up a whole different realm.

587
00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:34.930
Hieu: Gotcha.

588
00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:38.350
P2: Which were, If I'm still, if I'm

589
00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:44.790
P2: if she's my spouse, then this probably implies we're separated.

590
00:47:46.850 --> 00:47:51.069
P2: And this seems to be a very specific question, then to separation.

591
00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:52.590
Hieu: Gotcha.

592
00:47:53.090 --> 00:47:56.690
P2: I guess I really just. I don't want to.

593
00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:02.066
P2: I don't beat a dead horse, but I'll certainly kick it when it's down.

594
00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:06.290
P2: I I don't like your question here. I don't. I don't know what to get at.

595
00:48:06.650 --> 00:48:07.730
Hieu: Gotcha.

596
00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:09.369
Hieu: We can move on.

597
00:48:09.370 --> 00:48:10.470
P2: To you again. Sorry.

598
00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:12.240
Hieu: Yes, no worries.

599
00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:14.010
P2: Spouse. Okay.

600
00:48:14.345 --> 00:48:20.724
Hieu: Let's go through some of this relatively quick and get to the financial portion. Because I'm curious of your

601
00:48:21.250 --> 00:48:22.619
Hieu: your answers on those.

602
00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:23.800
P2: All right.

603
00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:30.939
P2: Okay, so hitting continue. I know this is probably just the demo. But having to scroll all the way back up

604
00:48:32.090 --> 00:48:34.459
P2: right is a little frustrating.

605
00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:36.840
Hieu: You rather have it. Go straight to the top.

606
00:48:37.070 --> 00:48:44.009
P2: If I'm hitting, continue. Yes, I would. I would expect to go to the next page, and I read top down, left to right, like.

607
00:48:44.890 --> 00:48:45.959
P2: you know, most.

608
00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:46.750
Hieu: Right.

609
00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:49.909
P2: So yeah, if I hit continue to the next page.

610
00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:54.730
P2: then I would expect to be in the top left of the next page, right?

611
00:48:54.730 --> 00:48:56.380
P2: Not having to scroll up. Okay.

612
00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:58.399
Hieu: And then we continue.

613
00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:00.010
P2: Yeah, so same thing.

614
00:49:00.570 --> 00:49:01.043
Hieu: And then

615
00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:05.800
P2: All right.

616
00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:08.200
P2: Hit continue.

617
00:49:08.380 --> 00:49:15.720
Hieu: Yes, please, and then it'd be your spouse income information here.

618
00:49:16.330 --> 00:49:17.230
P2: Okay.

619
00:49:22.333 --> 00:49:22.860
Hieu: Go ahead!

620
00:49:23.279 --> 00:49:30.830
P2: I don't like. Yeah, I mean, so the previous red had what I put down for last year.

621
00:49:30.830 --> 00:49:31.160
Hieu: Yeah.

622
00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:32.169
P2: That was helpful.

623
00:49:32.650 --> 00:49:33.109
Hieu: That was helpful.

624
00:49:33.110 --> 00:49:41.079
P2: Have it. Yeah, I think if if it's required and nothing's changed, then this should pre-populate gotcha.

625
00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:41.710
Hieu: Gotcha.

626
00:49:42.070 --> 00:49:45.130
P2: Or have it so I could see what I did report.

627
00:49:45.631 --> 00:49:49.709
Hieu: Otherwise I'm gonna be a little frustrated, and I'm reporting the same information. But.

628
00:49:50.110 --> 00:49:51.860
P2: I don't know if that's a big deal.

629
00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:59.249
Hieu: Right. So in your case, you do prefer the red option just because it gave you previous information. You filled out.

630
00:49:59.250 --> 00:50:00.000
P2: Yes.

631
00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:03.429
Hieu: Okay, that makes sense. Yeah, can you continue here?

632
00:50:08.180 --> 00:50:13.280
P2: Okay, I don't see the major difference at the end of the outside of what we already talked about.

633
00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:21.229
Hieu: And we can pause here and then. Was this any on this portion? Was it any

634
00:50:21.890 --> 00:50:27.769
Hieu: any of this part of this session was confusing to you, as opposed to the last one. The red version.

635
00:50:28.618 --> 00:50:36.180
P2: Outside of that question that really got me on providing financial support. And if we're talking functionality, no, there's

636
00:50:37.950 --> 00:50:40.970
P2: no I mean, this is all. This is easy as well.

637
00:50:40.970 --> 00:50:41.880
Hieu: Okay.

638
00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:46.730
P2: Yeah, I mean, I don't think anything significant to that.

639
00:50:46.730 --> 00:50:47.300
Hieu: Right.

640
00:50:47.450 --> 00:50:59.030
Hieu: and then on a scale of one to 5, 1 being very easy, 5 being very hard. How hard would you describe the it for you to complete this financial information section here.

641
00:50:59.250 --> 00:51:07.819
P2: Yeah, this one. I would rate lower than the red option, because you're not giving me what I did last year. So now I definitely haven't have

642
00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:09.630
P2: my answers.

643
00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:10.760
Hieu: Gotcha.

644
00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:13.999
P2: Because I don't even have a guide to go off of. So I'm gonna have to

645
00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:19.089
P2: go find the numbers because I yeah.

646
00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:25.190
Hieu: That makes sense to me alright, and then we can move on. Hit, continue.

647
00:51:29.450 --> 00:51:35.339
P2: Okay, same same. And I don't see any major differences here unless you want me click a plus. But

648
00:51:35.980 --> 00:51:41.040
P2: you know. And again, yeah, I would expect to see a check mark there unless I put it.

649
00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:41.710
Hieu: Right.

650
00:51:41.710 --> 00:51:43.009
P2: Or it comes out.

651
00:51:43.530 --> 00:51:44.440
Hieu: Sorry. Go ahead.

652
00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:58.029
Hieu: and then on a difficulty, scale of one to 11 being very easy, 5 being very hard. How was it for your experience for this whole form that you just went through.

653
00:51:59.290 --> 00:52:05.379
P2: Oh, I think I give you a high 2, if not a 1, it's it's pretty straightforward.

654
00:52:05.380 --> 00:52:06.180
Hieu: Okay?

655
00:52:06.490 --> 00:52:13.820
Hieu: And then on a efficiency scale, a 1 being very efficient, a 5 being very inefficient. How would you rate this for me?

656
00:52:14.090 --> 00:52:20.140
P2: Again. I probably give you about a 2. It seems to be efficient outside of the little gripes that I gave you.

657
00:52:20.140 --> 00:52:25.580
Hieu: Right, and then we can stop the demo there if you like.

658
00:52:26.210 --> 00:52:27.090
P2: And demo.

659
00:52:27.250 --> 00:52:28.380
Hieu: Yes, please.

660
00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:29.100
P2: Okay.

661
00:52:29.450 --> 00:52:32.960
Hieu: And then you don't have to share your screen anymore.

662
00:52:34.515 --> 00:52:35.460
Hieu: Okay?

663
00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:52.219
Hieu: And then, let's see, yeah, you can stop share. Now we finish with the demo portion. Are you available for another? Time is running out. We have about 4 min, but I'm wondering if you can stay another extra 5 to 10 min.

664
00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:53.240
P2: Surely.

665
00:52:53.460 --> 00:52:57.989
Hieu: Okay, thank you for that. I'll make it relatively quick. We have a

666
00:52:58.260 --> 00:53:01.000
Hieu: couple of last questions before we wrap up here.

667
00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:02.390
P2: All right.

668
00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:07.140
Hieu: Let me prep my screen because I'll be sharing this time.

669
00:53:11.540 --> 00:53:14.370
Hieu: so I will share my screen. Here.

670
00:53:18.210 --> 00:53:19.850
Hieu: Do you see my screen.

671
00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:21.100
P2: I do?

672
00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:23.130
Hieu: Okay, great.

673
00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:30.500
Hieu: So

674
00:53:33.220 --> 00:53:45.020
Hieu: of these threes of these 3 options, which one do you like most for the personal information kind of providing your name, your social security and your birthday.

675
00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:51.299
Hieu: Let me zoom in. If you're having trouble with that.

676
00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:52.480
P2: No, I

677
00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:55.379
P2: I was pitching the screen, so

678
00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:58.550
P2: it was fine with me, pitching the screens.

679
00:53:58.550 --> 00:53:59.790
Hieu: Oh, okay, so.

680
00:54:00.380 --> 00:54:03.359
P2: Leave yours to save that would work. Yeah, thank you.

681
00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:17.490
P2: I don't see any major things. I mean, I think the one on the right seems to color out the box a little bit, which helps.

682
00:54:17.750 --> 00:54:18.580
Hieu: Okay.

683
00:54:19.216 --> 00:54:25.300
P2: I don't know. I mean, I I think this is more personal preferences than anything I can really help you out with.

684
00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:25.979
Hieu: Right so now.

685
00:54:25.980 --> 00:54:29.579
P2: I don't see a major difference. Yeah, I don't. I don't have a major.

686
00:54:29.970 --> 00:54:31.070
Hieu: Gotcha.

687
00:54:31.070 --> 00:54:33.160
P2: I think, probably. Yeah. Putting a

688
00:54:33.790 --> 00:54:36.200
P2: a box around. Sorry about that.

689
00:54:39.140 --> 00:54:44.200
P2: Having a box, or at least coloring out my information to

690
00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:48.910
P2: what you've put in there, I think, is probably best.

691
00:54:49.260 --> 00:54:50.470
Hieu: So option b.

692
00:54:50.470 --> 00:54:53.640
P2: The one on the left. Yeah, I'm not a big fan of the one on the left.

693
00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:54.530
Hieu: Gotcha.

694
00:54:54.845 --> 00:54:59.570
P2: So, B or C, yeah, I probably go more for colors than I do. Boxes.

695
00:55:01.090 --> 00:55:02.590
Hieu: Alright! Thank you for that.

696
00:55:03.170 --> 00:55:08.910
Hieu: And then for this option. Here the marital status, we have 2 different ways of displaying information.

697
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:26.859
P2: Okay, if it's asked me, what is my marital status? Then I think the one on the right with the circles is probably easier than the dropdown.

698
00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:28.729
Hieu: Okay. So you prefer those.

699
00:55:28.730 --> 00:55:31.519
P2: If I'm if I'm having to change it, then

700
00:55:35.110 --> 00:55:40.939
P2: I don't know, I would say, if there's no change, you know. Why do I

701
00:55:41.090 --> 00:55:43.029
P2: have to go through this.

702
00:55:43.250 --> 00:55:44.120
Hieu: Right.

703
00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:47.420
P2: If there is a change, then I would say.

704
00:55:48.580 --> 00:55:54.209
P2: either is about to say, you know, I'm gonna have to do a select of some type, or having it there.

705
00:55:55.130 --> 00:55:55.850
Hieu: Right.

706
00:55:55.850 --> 00:55:58.766
P2: So yeah, I don't know what to tell you.

707
00:55:59.090 --> 00:56:10.929
Hieu: Let's say, let's say you went from married to divorce. So previously you selected, married, and now you selected divorce, and then it gives you this screen.

708
00:56:11.170 --> 00:56:14.680
Hieu: Can you talk me through what your thought process is?

709
00:56:20.550 --> 00:56:21.390
P2: Okay,

710
00:56:25.430 --> 00:56:27.779
P2: no, I guess that makes sense. If I

711
00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:33.909
P2: divorced and remarried, I wouldn't want previous spouse information on the form. So.

712
00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:39.190
Hieu: Okay, so it's.

713
00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:43.400
P2: I'm fine with that. No, it makes it makes sense to me.

714
00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:44.330
Hieu: Gotcha.

715
00:56:45.530 --> 00:56:51.659
Hieu: Then finally, 2 different options here for the incomes.

716
00:56:58.090 --> 00:57:04.199
P2: Yeah, I'm still a fan of the right. Let me see what what was in there from last year or previous.

717
00:57:04.350 --> 00:57:06.059
Hieu: Gotcha, you're a fan of that.

718
00:57:06.750 --> 00:57:15.670
Hieu: And then can you expand on that? Your over thought of the the 2 prototypes that you went through today. So the red prototype and then the green prototype.

719
00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:22.479
P2: Yeah, I mean, it gets back to the prep. It gets back to the whole premise. If it's something that I'm changing.

720
00:57:23.500 --> 00:57:28.359
P2: then why do. I have to go through and select and reenter everything

721
00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:30.949
P2: that hasn't changed. In other words.

722
00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:37.170
P2: I would expect something like on the left if I haven't put any input in previously.

723
00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:38.040
Hieu: Gotcha.

724
00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:43.119
P2: If I'm changing, then I want to kind of bust through some of these screens

725
00:57:43.700 --> 00:57:48.550
P2: that I know haven't changed. It would be the one on the right would make sense to me.

726
00:57:48.850 --> 00:57:51.710
Hieu: Gotcha, and thank you for that. That is kind of

727
00:57:52.170 --> 00:57:55.930
Hieu: and last question. There, then, do you have any questions for me?

728
00:57:57.461 --> 00:57:59.500
P2: No, you! I think I got it.

729
00:57:59.650 --> 00:58:00.940
Hieu: Okay.

730
00:58:01.080 --> 00:58:03.849
Hieu: So let me see if I have anything else.

731
00:58:04.300 --> 00:58:13.220
Hieu: I think that's it. I want to circle back and reconfirm that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our Va. Partners.

732
00:58:13.790 --> 00:58:14.440
P2: Yes.

733
00:58:14.750 --> 00:58:24.598
Hieu: Okay? And then just to remind you, if we do choose to share it, we'll kind of erase any identifying information in the video. And then

734
00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:55.140
Hieu: and that's kind of it. I just want to say we appreciate you taking your time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is helpful for us to kind of continue updating and kind of making the work better for all veterans. And then, lastly, Prijen did send you a Thank you. Note, or Will sent you a thank you. Note with a little blurb, that you could pass on along to other veterans who may, who you may know that will provide them a chance to participate in future studies.

735
00:58:55.670 --> 00:58:56.520
P2: Body, fun.

736
00:58:56.830 --> 00:59:00.070
Hieu: Alright, thank you again, and enjoy the rest of your day.

737
00:59:00.260 --> 00:59:09.660
P2: Hey? Thank you again and appreciate the opportunity. And and I think we're not. Jody said way too much during the session, so they need to pipe down, I guess.

738
00:59:09.740 --> 00:59:10.300
Hieu: Ha! Ha!

739
00:59:10.300 --> 00:59:11.039
P2: I'm just kidding.

740
00:59:12.290 --> 00:59:14.439
Hieu: Alright! Thank you for that.

741
00:59:14.440 --> 00:59:14.870
P2: Okay.

742
00:59:14.870 --> 00:59:16.400
Hieu: Alright! Enjoy the rest of your day.

743
00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:17.600
P2: You do the same.
