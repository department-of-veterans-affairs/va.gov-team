1
00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:11.100
P3: So I've started recording. I like to confirm that. Are you confirm? Are you comfortable? If I record my screen and audio as we talk today.

2
00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.450
P3: Yeah, go for it.

3
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:19.899
Hieu: And then are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with our Va partners.

4
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.420
P3: Yeah, no. Problem.

5
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:32.746
Hieu: All right, thank you. And that's all the kind of technical jargons out of the way here. We'll move on to the warm up questions before we look at the prototype.

6
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:39.279
Hieu: do you have a service-connected disability rating at the Va.

7
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:40.390
P3: Yes, I do.

8
00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.549
Hieu: And then what is your disability rating.

9
00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.379
P3: It's 60%.

10
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.000
Hieu: 60. And then have you recently visited the va.gov website?

11
00:00:49.512 --> 00:00:50.450
P3: Yes, I have.

12
00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.050
Hieu: Okay. And then may I ask for what reason?

13
00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.369
P3: It was to refill prescriptions.

14
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:22.640
Hieu: I gotcha all right, and then I will move on to our prototypes, for today you'll be looking at 2 different prototype. One is option green and one is option red. Imagine that you have a spouse and one dependent. And then for this scenario you'll be filling. You have filled out a similar form before now. They're just asking you to update your financial information

15
00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:29.790
Hieu: in this scenario. You logged onto your va.gov account where the system has pre-filled some of the information for you

16
00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.740
Hieu: for this scenario. Are you comfortable with sharing your screen and talking through the process.

17
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.319
P3: Yeah, yeah, no. Problem.

18
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.679
Hieu: Okay, I will share a the prototype with you. And then

19
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:52.090
Hieu: once you kind of get that loaded. Please close any personal information like email, Facebook or anything like that before you share your screen.

20
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.279
P3: Yes, I will share it. One second let me find.

21
00:02:00.136 --> 00:02:01.650
P3: Da da!

22
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.620
P3: Give me one second.

23
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:05.840
Hieu: Not a problem.

24
00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:10.210
P3: 2

25
00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:26.830
P3: and last one there, those alright. So I got it. Let me share my screen here, this one.

26
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.670
P3: and share alright.

27
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.539
P3: Do you see what I'm seeing?

28
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:34.880
Hieu: Yes, I do.

29
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.500
P3: Alright. Let me move that out of the way.

30
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.040
P3: Okay, let me expand that.

31
00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.529
P3: There you go.

32
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:49.030
Hieu: Alrighty, and then we'll start with the green option. So you click on the green.

33
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.000
P3: Okay.

34
00:02:50.870 --> 00:03:11.550
Hieu: And then. So please take a few moments to go through this page. I like you to kind of think out loud as as much as possible, noting anything confusing. And I do just want to note that you are essentially you filled out a similar form before now. You're just going through confirming information before you have to fill out the financial information.

35
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:23.550
P3: Okay, so update your Va health benefits. Information health benefits. Update form. Va, form 10, dash 10 easy r.

36
00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:30.890
P3: so in my mind that I automatically think that's an easy form like, you know how like, there's a the tax form.

37
00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.660
P3: 1040, easy. It's kind of okay.

38
00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.779
P3: Right? So I am Riley Smith in this situation, right here.

39
00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:39.810
Hieu: That is correct.

40
00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:50.230
P3: Okay? So my social security is blocked out. Obviously for privacy reasons, except for the last 4, which is normal, because whenever I go to the Va. They always ask us

41
00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:57.399
P3: the question, What's your last name? And what's your last 4? So no problems there date of birth easy.

42
00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.320
P3: And I I do like the whole we saved your request

43
00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.230
P3: business about when when I actually started this. That's good.

44
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.829
P3: Alright, I'm gonna continue.

45
00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:10.670
Hieu: Okay.

46
00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.959
P3: We pre filled some of your information from your account.

47
00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:21.950
P3: Okay, I pop pop, cool.

48
00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:31.659
P3: cool, easy. So that's my pre filled information from others is your home address the same as your mailing address? I apparently have said No.

49
00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.780
P3: and I'm gonna continue.

50
00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:34.770
Hieu: Okay.

51
00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.299
P3: Okay? And this is my mailing address versus my home address.

52
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.749
P3: So it is a different. It's different. Right?

53
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:56.649
P3: Yeah. Tell him court versus Sloan Avenue. Okay, moving on my phone and email address.

54
00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:10.799
P3: And your phone number and email is optional, but obviously makes things easier. If you guys got it, we'll also mail you a copy of your decisions. Yep, that's very beneficial in my history.

55
00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.880
P3: Okay, moving on.

56
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.920
Hieu: Okay.

57
00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.059
P3: So household financial information. This is what you were talking about.

58
00:05:20.957 --> 00:05:27.749
P3: I am married like you, said. I think you, Hugh, you said I have the dependent as well.

59
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.960
Hieu: Yeah, so you have a spouse and a dependent. And then, okay.

60
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:37.559
Hieu: stop you right there. If you're no longer married, what do you expect to happen when you choose one or the other status.

61
00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.478
P3: Okay. Well, I'm not gonna click on it, but

62
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.539
P3: If I'm not married it should it should just say single.

63
00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:50.959
P3: I would say I, I would think it would just say single let's see.

64
00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.850
P3: Separated. Never married.

65
00:05:56.016 --> 00:06:08.659
P3: You know what? That one's pretty good, too. Yeah. The never married would be good cause, you know, some some people would think that. Well, I've I'm not married, but I'm in a Co. I forgot what they call it.

66
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.789
P3: It's like Co relationship Co living sort of situation where.

67
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.050
Hieu: Cohabitat, or something.

68
00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:16.860
P3: Yeah, something like that. Exactly.

69
00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:17.220
Hieu: Yeah.

70
00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:22.979
P3: So never married is is the preferred. I think that's the best situation, the the best option there.

71
00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.380
P3: Okay, like, am I? Get.

72
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:24.730
Hieu: Yes.

73
00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:26.110
Hieu: Yeah. Right?

74
00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.100
P3: My spouse's name, Jordan Smith.

75
00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:34.060
P3: Social?

76
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:35.600
P3: Okay.

77
00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:43.220
P3: Gave us date of marriage. Yep, that's right, because I am married to this guy continuing

78
00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:53.499
P3: spouse. Did you live with your spouse for all all of, or part of 2024? No.

79
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:58.569
P3: do you? Okay, that would make sense. Why, they would be both. No, they haven't lived with them.

80
00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:00.439
P3: moving on.

81
00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:04.200
P3: Okay.

82
00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:14.550
P3: Spouses, financial support, what we consider financial support for a spouse. Did you provide financial support to your spouse, even though you didn't live together. I clicked on no

83
00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:20.390
P3: alright same. Oh, the office and shoot farms.

84
00:07:21.304 --> 00:07:26.029
P3: Yeah. Yeah. Spouse's address and phone number

85
00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:31.739
P3: street farms for Pennsylvania cool. This is all typical admin stuff.

86
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:39.150
P3: Alright, my dependent. I have a son, Michael Scott.

87
00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:45.730
P3: and do I have another dependency report? No. Could you just say I have one so moving on.

88
00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:54.039
P3: and here's my income income from gross, gross income from work, gross income.

89
00:07:54.440 --> 00:08:03.300
Hieu: For this section. I'll give you like the financial information you'll need. If it was real it'd be like an Irs form or a W. 2, or you know.

90
00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:03.660
P3: Something.

91
00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:10.499
Hieu: You gather your financial information on. But for this exercise you technically

92
00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:23.179
Hieu: gather this information beforehand, and then I just want to note that for this scenario. You and your spouse's work and salary has not changed from 2,023 to 2,024.

93
00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:24.110
P3: Okay.

94
00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:32.000
Hieu: And then, yeah. And then I guess if you click it for the demo purposes, it started filling in information for you. Yeah.

95
00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:42.059
Hieu: Oh, that's right. Okay? So there's no change. From last year to this year. Gross annual income for both of us is 62 K.

96
00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:49.680
P3: Net income. 45. Okay, that's from the spouse's net annual income. So the spouse

97
00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:55.540
P3: alright other income 0 bucks.

98
00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:56.110
Hieu: Oh!

99
00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:00.739
P3: Is that right there here.

100
00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:01.710
Hieu: That is correct.

101
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:03.340
P3: Alright cool moving on.

102
00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:11.860
P3: Okay, spouse's annual income. So this is where my spouse makes some money.

103
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:18.769
P3: Made 50 G's 45 k.

104
00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:23.660
P3: From the farm property or business other income 0.

105
00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:30.160
P3: So, does that mean, these are just random numbers. You guys put together. Right?

106
00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.210
P3: Yeah, that is correct.

107
00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:35.000
P3: Yeah, never mind, I'm just trying to think more into it. Alright. So I'm gonna move on

108
00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:39.929
P3: deductible expenses from 2024.

109
00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:48.170
P3: Okay, so medical pay the non reimbursable medical incomes. About 500 bucks.

110
00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:55.980
P3: Okay. Spent 4, 30 on school in some way.

111
00:09:56.730 --> 00:10:01.459
P3: Funeral services, $0. No one died alright. Cool. Continue.

112
00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:10.859
Hieu: I'll stop you right there. Yeah, let's pause here. So during this financial information portion, was there any part that was confusing to you?

113
00:10:12.126 --> 00:10:17.780
P3: No, not not necessarily. It just seemed it seemed. Here I'm gonna go back.

114
00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:18.660
Hieu: Sure.

115
00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:24.330
P3: Yeah, let's see, there was one part.

116
00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:34.099
P3: Okay. So here, gross income, it's stating it doesn't say anything about spouse. So

117
00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:37.940
P3: this is stating that it was me and the spouse

118
00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:42.439
P3: earnings together. So 62,000,

119
00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:46.459
P3: and then here you're also including spouse for this.

120
00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:47.540
Hieu: Oh, okay.

121
00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:49.909
P3: Yeah, shouldn't that be me and not.

122
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:52.979
Hieu: It's a typo in our our part. My part, at least.

123
00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:56.609
P3: Okay, okay. So that was the only thing that popped out to me.

124
00:10:57.189 --> 00:11:06.309
P3: Everything else was just straightforward. There was nothing confusing from, you know I've I'm pretty sure I've done this before, so there's nothing

125
00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.140
P3: nothing confusing for me.

126
00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:19.249
Hieu: Okay, and then on a scale of one to 5, 1 being very easy, 5 being very hard. How difficult was it for you to complete the financial information. If you were to do this with real information.

127
00:11:20.031 --> 00:11:24.599
P3: With real information for me it would be a 1 cause. It's easy.

128
00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:32.899
P3: The only hard part that I could see for other folk would be have them having their tax forms on the ready

129
00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:40.690
P3: to fill out their information. But that's more on them than you guys. You know. You're requesting that it's their obligation to

130
00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:43.340
P3: provide that information.

131
00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:43.930
Hieu: Gotcha.

132
00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:46.080
P3: So yeah, easy. Peasy.

133
00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:51.530
Hieu: And then do you have any suggestion or feedback for the financial pages that you just went through.

134
00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:56.019
P3: Oh, no, no, I don't. I do not

135
00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:01.360
P3: think so from a farm, property or business.

136
00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:14.820
P3: No, I don't. I think it's good that, you know, you obviously put gross versus net because some people won't know the difference between the 2. So that's that's a common

137
00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:22.380
P3: necessity to to spell out, you know, for him, but no other than that. I don't.

138
00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:27.430
P3: It's it's like I said. It's just pretty straightforward. There's no no confusing part for me.

139
00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.219
Hieu: Gotcha. Then can you scroll up here.

140
00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:36.963
Hieu: So in this page is the review page. Would you expand it to review.

141
00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:39.760
P3: So

142
00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:47.499
P3: it's good that you guys have the edit one, because let's say, someone fat fingers it and wants to go back easy. Just press it.

143
00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:58.460
P3: Contact info. Yes, yes, riley.smith@email.com married spouse's name.

144
00:12:58.650 --> 00:12:59.530
P3: So

145
00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:08.233
P3: I never seen the like circle for blocking up the number.

146
00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:14.220
P3: Did you live with your spouse? Yep, yep, yep.

147
00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:23.720
P3: Did you provide them spouse's contact? Info my dependence, info blended.

148
00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:27.230
P3: They become your dependent of it on the same day.

149
00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:34.089
P3: Gross, gross net, spouse! Yep, deductibles!

150
00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:36.980
P3: Yep, all good.

151
00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:49.269
Hieu: Okay? In this scenario you realize that one of your expenses actually incorrect. You have a big out of pocket dental operation last year for $3,000. How would you fix that error.

152
00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:57.459
P3: Okay, so dental, it's a medical medical dental. So let's see.

153
00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:05.879
P3: it wouldn't be here. You're saying I had some sort of dental so deductible.

154
00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:14.149
P3: Enter the amount you or your spouse, if you're married, paid in non-reimbursable medical expenses, and

155
00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:23.729
P3: in 2024, so I would place it here as non reimbursable. I'll go and click on edit.

156
00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:31.889
P3: and then I know for the demo it doesn't get me back right. But yeah, I would just go under. The where was it?

157
00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:33.740
Hieu: Okay. You'll fix it right then and there.

158
00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:34.969
P3: Oh, yeah, yeah, for sure.

159
00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:36.160
Hieu: Straightforward for you.

160
00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:47.770
P3: on a difficulty of a scale of one to 5. You know one being very easy and then 5 being very hard, how is the whole form that you just went through.

161
00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:49.920
P3: Oh, it's easy. It's a 1.

162
00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:50.530
Hieu: To one.

163
00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:52.323
P3: For sure. Yeah, yeah.

164
00:14:53.590 --> 00:15:07.599
P3: non reimbursable medical expenses. A a part of me thinks this. This goes into nitty gritty of like in Hsa. And non reimbursable house. How you can sometimes get

165
00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:16.299
P3: some sort of payment back. I'm just getting into the weeds now, regardless, I think it's easy. It's cool.

166
00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:16.700
Hieu: Okay.

167
00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:29.029
P3: I just think of that specific scenario, and it will, you know, taxes all of that thing. How it makes things complicated. But the point is, it's easy. I would go through this in about 5 to 10 min.

168
00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:30.510
P3: and Gotcha on.

169
00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:38.960
Hieu: And then on efficiency scale. Then, one being very efficient and 5 being very inefficient, how would you rate the whole form? You just went through.

170
00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:47.028
P3: I would say one. Because again, you guys have the edit? Yeah, yeah, I think I think that's what you guys have for fishing. Right.

171
00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:50.010
P3: Could you have the edit one right there every time?

172
00:15:50.160 --> 00:16:00.639
P3: It's it's perfect. Just so, you know, I make a mistake. I can just go back. Fix it real quick, and then come back to the same page, and I should be good to, you know. Press, continue.

173
00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:25.410
Hieu: Gotcha, all right. And then, yeah, you can press the end demo right there. It'll take you back to the start. And then for the second part, we'll go through the red option so we just complete the green option. Now we'll move on to the red option. And in this option some of the screen will be the same, and other screens will be different. Again. I want you to kind of speak talk out loud as you're going through this.

174
00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:47.009
P3: Yeah, sure. Sure. Okay. So one thing I did know, that's different. If my memory serves me right, is, it seems like this is shorter as a shorter page than than the one previously, where my information is laid out like this in a box. I don't my memory might be bad, but I don't remember the option. Green it having a box with my information in there.

175
00:16:47.917 --> 00:16:51.680
P3: We'll save your application returns cool.

176
00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:55.620
P3: You still have my saved request. Info

177
00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:58.510
P3: review your information before you continue.

178
00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:01.710
P3: This is fine. So I'm gonna continue.

179
00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:02.310
Hieu: Yep.

180
00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:09.270
P3: Review your contact information that is saved from before.

181
00:17:10.112 --> 00:17:15.540
P3: Mailing address here, mailing address here, following here.

182
00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:23.530
P3: Co current contact info. Yes, I already like this one. I don't know why I like the boxes, you know. I like how.

183
00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:23.950
Hieu: Okay.

184
00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:40.479
P3: The mailing addresses in. It's in its own box. It has the important information needed in the previous one. It was just it. The the page was longer, because it was stretched out for your your home.

185
00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:42.960
P3: and each line was there

186
00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:51.530
P3: for specifics, whereas this it just is a summary of what it is, and if I have a mistake I would just click on edit. Boom! Boom!

187
00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:54.359
Hieu: You like this summary over the detailed one.

188
00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:58.480
P3: Yeah, okay, I I do. I do like the boxes, cause

189
00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:11.979
P3: I know my address pretty well. I know my home address pretty well. I know my phone numbers pretty well. I don't need to do the scrolling, you know and an excessive amount of scrolling.

190
00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:19.359
P3: so here, okay, so there's no more dropdown.

191
00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:22.840
P3: It is the multiple choice option.

192
00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:32.099
P3: And now for this one, I I like the the multiple choice instead of the dropdown.

193
00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:48.210
P3: So it gives me. It gives me an expanded view instead of me just clicking on the dropdown. Why not? Sure. But I just think sometimes marital status or relationship status could be a little complicated for some folks.

194
00:18:48.876 --> 00:18:53.999
P3: And then, just seeing the options is good instead of them clicking the dropdown.

195
00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:55.280
Hieu: I gotcha.

196
00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:03.349
P3: And now, yeah, no, this is, I like the way this is laid out.

197
00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:10.649
P3: So I'm gonna continue, I'm reviewing my spouse's info. Okay?

198
00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:17.450
P3: So it just says, married, make any needed edits. Then select. Continue.

199
00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:22.380
P3: It's in a box which is good.

200
00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:25.340
P3: but it it does feel like it's.

201
00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:28.989
P3: It needs a little bit more here.

202
00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:35.639
P3: you know. It just says married. It doesn't say any other important information.

203
00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:44.969
P3: at least in the previous boxes. They gave me something more. But here it just says married, I mean it doesn't say let's say

204
00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:56.376
P3: addresses as you know, the same address as as

205
00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:09.040
P3: as veteran, you know, just just as married it. It doesn't give me anything more, and I know I can click on edit and it expands it. But it just seems like it's lacking more information.

206
00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:10.639
Hieu: You want a little bit more.

207
00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:18.829
P3: Yeah, like for one like like. Here, Whoa, look at this. See, you gave me the home address you gave me the mailing address with with the information.

208
00:20:19.810 --> 00:20:20.770
P3: but.

209
00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:24.639
Hieu: Gotcha. This seems to lack of the lack of information here.

210
00:20:24.965 --> 00:20:36.990
P3: And and who's to say, you can't just expand the box to be you know longer this sort of you know, you could just expand it a little bit more to fit in the information.

211
00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:37.900
Hieu: And then.

212
00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:47.190
Hieu: And then in the last portion, since you've seen some of that information, do you have an idea of what you would like to it to be shown here.

213
00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:50.100
P3: Yeah.

214
00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:59.530
P3: The address when we got married, you know.

215
00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:00.610
Hieu: Yeah.

216
00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:05.680
P3: They think that's really it. But probably date of birth would be well, no. Now.

217
00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:11.129
P3: okay. Social security lasts for

218
00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:16.820
P3: Dob date of birth, married date

219
00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:21.619
P3: and address. Same yes or no, you know.

220
00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:22.390
Hieu: Yeah, yeah.

221
00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:26.310
P3: That's that's what I put. I hear you. Okay, continuing

222
00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:33.109
P3: your dependents. So my dependents. Next, we'll ask you about your dependents. You can add up to

223
00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:35.949
P3: well, this is this page needs something.

224
00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:41.240
P3: This this page is yes.

225
00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:50.849
P3: I feel like you can add something to this page. You can start with the dependence part. So here I'm just gonna continue real quick.

226
00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:51.610
Hieu: Okay.

227
00:21:56.740 --> 00:22:03.170
P3: And again, Hugh, is this, this is supposed to be for the mobile app, right? It's not supposed to be for the website.

228
00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:09.680
Hieu: It's both technically it's this has, like the mobile. And then the website as well.

229
00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:17.989
P3: Hmm, yeah, I just I just think, why not combine the 2.

230
00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:18.950
Hieu: Right.

231
00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:21.170
P3: Why not just combine these 2 pages?

232
00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:23.400
P3: And let's just as as.

233
00:22:24.170 --> 00:22:26.309
Hieu: Feels like there's a waste of page here.

234
00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:28.510
P3: Yeah, yeah, for sure.

235
00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:29.910
Hieu: Absolutely.

236
00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:35.490
P3: That's what I think about that one edit delete

237
00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:44.369
P3: of Michael Scott, my son, he's my dependent. Great. Do you have another dependent of reports you can add up to X some more dependents.

238
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:46.880
P3: You can include your spouse.

239
00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:58.049
P3: That's good, though the dependent tidbits here is

240
00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:05.800
P3: right cause even I forget what qualifies as a dependent, you know, cause I do. My spouse is a dependent

241
00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:09.050
P3: My chat.

242
00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:10.510
Hieu: So you like to hit text?

243
00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:16.289
Hieu: Oh, yeah, yeah, for sure. Because even when I do my taxes, I I also have to think about.

244
00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:26.678
P3: What does the Irs qualify as a spouse? Give me some information just to rejog my memory, you know, or like a dependent

245
00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:34.921
P3: or have a permanent disability that it doesn't have anything about my like parents. Why doesn't it have anything about

246
00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:41.619
P3: If my parents are old and frail, and they can't take care of themselves. They would be considered a dependent.

247
00:23:42.104 --> 00:23:49.790
P3: I know, for tax purposes I could. I could qual they could be qualified as a dependent. So here you just have children

248
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:58.800
P3: or have a permanent disability that begin. Yeah, all of this is just children a partner. Why not?

249
00:23:59.520 --> 00:23:59.930
Hieu: Apparently.

250
00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:09.790
P3: Parents. Parents, yeah, that part second so for this case, no, I don't want to add another dependent. So I'm gonna continue.

251
00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:11.470
Hieu: Right go ahead!

252
00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:16.730
P3: Do you have income and deductible expenses to add for 2024?

253
00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:23.900
P3: Okay, so if I click, yes, it's going to start this next page.

254
00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:28.030
P3: For this.

255
00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:37.830
P3: Why, okay, well, here's another point. Why don't you combine the 2 again? So.

256
00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:38.200
Hieu: Right.

257
00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:39.699
P3: It could, it could be?

258
00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:43.370
P3: It's just this question, right? It's just this question.

259
00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:50.520
P3: And then when you click on next, this all expands out to include what? My.

260
00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:54.744
P3: what, what I'm trying to put in. You know what I'm trying to add.

261
00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:55.580
Hieu: Fair.

262
00:24:55.830 --> 00:25:00.799
P3: So it could. It could just be this this page. And then when I click on yes, boom!

263
00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:02.320
Hieu: Answer, this.

264
00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:04.740
P3: It expands to all of this exactly.

265
00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:05.550
Hieu: All right.

266
00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:17.909
P3: so gross income from work. Obviously the tidbit is great. Thank you. Your gross income from 2023.

267
00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:23.289
P3: That's nice to put on there, but that sometimes is requested

268
00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:29.320
P3: from the year before. Good! Now, my gross income 62.

269
00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:31.980
P3: So there's no difference between the 2

270
00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:38.580
P3: net income from farm property or business. 47 k.

271
00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:42.500
P3: So then, I need to put in for this year's

272
00:25:43.015 --> 00:25:49.340
P3: what? 2024 boom. Other income is additional income that doesn't come from a job.

273
00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:58.409
P3: What we consider. I always like these dropdowns. These are. These are nice, for sure.

274
00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:00.020
Hieu: You like the trial you like the edit.

275
00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:00.530
P3: Oh, yeah.

276
00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:01.400
Hieu: Information yeah.

277
00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:05.730
P3: Very good, very good. Yeah. Hmm!

278
00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:08.920
P3: And I do like the choice of

279
00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:13.798
P3: having the the notes right here where it's not a not a click, not a dropdown.

280
00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:15.500
Hieu: Do you like the hint text.

281
00:26:16.050 --> 00:26:24.239
P3: Yeah, yeah, for sure, because both of these don't need to be a dropdown, this one with the static static info right here. Good.

282
00:26:24.610 --> 00:26:25.970
P3: This dropdown.

283
00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:31.649
P3: Great. So okay, good. To continue.

284
00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:32.509
Hieu: Move on!

285
00:26:33.815 --> 00:26:36.690
P3: Now it's my spouses. So

286
00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:45.009
P3: yes, so my spouse's annual income. Does that hold on?

287
00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:46.320
P3: Let me go back.

288
00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:51.269
P3: Do you have income and deductible expenses, do you

289
00:26:53.440 --> 00:27:00.450
P3: and your spouse? Because this one's just signifying just myself? And then this one is the spouse's income.

290
00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:06.370
P3: So why don't we have that same question here.

291
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:10.320
P3: Correct, do you?

292
00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:14.459
P3: Does your spouse be? Do your spouse?

293
00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:20.510
P3: Does your spouse have income and deductible expenses for 20.

294
00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:22.560
Hieu: Because you're expecting that question at

295
00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:25.679
Hieu: applies to you. Now you want a spouse. One.

296
00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:27.340
P3: Yeah, for sure, for sure.

297
00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:34.140
P3: I I was not. I wasn't necessarily expecting my spouses to come up. I was expecting in their question, like the one.

298
00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:34.960
Hieu: That makes sense.

299
00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:41.899
P3: Yep. So this is the same business as before. To drop down like I said, is good the last years.

300
00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:50.309
P3: The box that tells me what she earn, even even better. Continuation.

301
00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:55.319
P3: Other income. No information. Okay. Continuing.

302
00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:55.930
Hieu: Yep.

303
00:27:56.820 --> 00:28:06.340
P3: Alright, now, deductible expenses in 2024. Now this counts as me mine. So hold on.

304
00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:08.780
P3: Hmm.

305
00:28:15.730 --> 00:28:22.159
P3: okay, you and your spouse, you or your spouse. So this is seeing us as one entity for deduct.

306
00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:22.549
Hieu: In the world.

307
00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:24.060
P3: Expenses. All right.

308
00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:33.168
P3: I was gonna say something about it. But then I read about this, you or your spouse if you're married, hey? So this is all together, both of us.

309
00:28:34.276 --> 00:28:37.609
P3: Last year's great this year's got it.

310
00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:50.199
P3: Nothing for college. Oh, sorry 4 30 for last year for college or vocational expenses. Same business. For this year no one died, no one died. Great news continue.

311
00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:56.109
P3: and a summary of your income and deductible expenses.

312
00:28:57.030 --> 00:28:59.400
P3: Your income.

313
00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:08.140
P3: Review your household income and deductible expenses from 2024.

314
00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:15.219
Hieu: So there's a few kind of verbiage that you want to change or needs to make clear.

315
00:29:15.390 --> 00:29:35.450
P3: Yeah, but it does seem like it would be a little bit of an issue for you all. So let's say, if I am never married. Then that would be right. Right. It would be. Review your income and deductible expenses from 2024 if I am with other dependents, or I'm sorry. Not under depends. With a spouse. If I'm married, it should probably say, review your

316
00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:46.919
P3: household income deductible and expenses from 2024, because it's 2 people. It's not just one. This is signifying that it's just me. But that's false, because we're 2 people right here.

317
00:29:47.685 --> 00:29:52.549
P3: Your annual income from 2024. That's right, right?

318
00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:55.310
P3: Right? Right? This is good. This box is.

319
00:29:55.663 --> 00:30:02.740
Hieu: And then we'll pause right there. And was there any part that was confusing to you for this portion.

320
00:30:03.853 --> 00:30:06.439
P3: Other than the stuff that I've already mentioned.

321
00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:19.069
P3: No, I'm a fan of your boxes. Yeah, no, I'm now. I'm just talking about positives, though it's just a positive it's big fan of the box like the summary, the way it is. Yeah.

322
00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:25.419
Hieu: Okay? And then how does this financial section compare to the previous one in the previous option.

323
00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:29.210
P3: I like this one better.

324
00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:31.279
P3: I like optional red better.

325
00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:34.819
Hieu: Can you? Can you elaborate on that.

326
00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:36.878
P3: Yeah, for sure. It's it's

327
00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:40.659
P3: the presence of the boxes separating

328
00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:52.279
P3: different sections like mailing. Address. Home address. Yeah, I can edit it, if if need be. I'm just thinking about this from a speed standpoint.

329
00:30:52.520 --> 00:31:14.320
P3: Whenever I would get this, I obviously wanna make sure it's good. But I have other things to do. So. If I see the mailing address home address in their separate boxes that the information is correct, I'm good to continue. I don't have to spend. I know it's small and minuscule, but I don't have to spend an extra 3 seconds on this page, you know.

330
00:31:15.128 --> 00:31:20.839
P3: For option green, I would spend, let's say, 5 seconds on the page, whereas

331
00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:26.890
P3: I would spend 2 seconds on the page. Sure, it saves me 3 seconds. But

332
00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:32.130
P3: yeah, we're we have. We lack patience now, right? We always want things to be done.

333
00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:32.530
Hieu: Right.

334
00:31:32.530 --> 00:31:39.580
P3: Fast, and that's why I think option red would be better in terms of speed, and knocking this out.

335
00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:47.489
Hieu: That makes sense, and then on a scale of one to 5, 1 being very easy, 5 being very hard. How would you rate the

336
00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:52.110
Hieu: financial section of this area. If you were to do this with real information.

337
00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:55.559
P3: Oh, still one, it's still one. This isn't.

338
00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:58.570
P3: That's not rocket science for for me.

339
00:31:58.960 --> 00:31:59.860
Hieu: Gotcha.

340
00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:06.330
Hieu: And then did you find the gray box reference to be helpful? The one that says your previous.

341
00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:13.190
P3: Oh, yeah, yeah, for sure. A 100%. That was that was, thank you for bringing that up. I like that one

342
00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:15.669
P3: way more, because

343
00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:30.240
P3: if I don't know, I'm not going to know 2020 three's gross off the top of my head right? So that requires me to open up another document in my files for 2023 gross income. So that's that's very, very helpful.

344
00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:31.220
Hieu: Gotcha.

345
00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:48.039
Hieu: and then in this scenario the expense is also incorrect. So you remember last time the non reimbursal medical expense? It would be incorrect. Now, would you say this scenario is, would this screen make it easier to catch.

346
00:32:50.850 --> 00:32:53.309
P3: Oh, the catch that I made the mistake.

347
00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:53.690
Hieu: Yeah.

348
00:32:53.690 --> 00:33:13.970
P3: It would be. Yes, this one would be way easier for sure, because the last screen was stretched out pretty long, and I might have missed it, whereas right here, boom! I already know. I'm checking it off. Boom! Non reimbursable medical expenses, 496. I know that's wrong at the top of my head. It's right in front of my face. I don't have to

349
00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:20.209
P3: scroll down, you know, excessively, to see that. So yeah, it's better here.

350
00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:22.990
Hieu: Okay, thank you for that. And then we can continue here.

351
00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:23.900
P3: Sure.

352
00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:33.349
Hieu: It's the same similar page as last time.

353
00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:35.240
P3: Yes, yes.

354
00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:40.769
P3: Oh, that's what you meant. Yes. So the household information. This is what I was mean, meaning.

355
00:33:40.890 --> 00:33:41.700
Hieu: Yeah.

356
00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:43.879
P3: So you're saying.

357
00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:48.150
Hieu: Because this expanded a lot that it's harder to follow or kind of scan.

358
00:33:48.570 --> 00:33:51.669
P3: Yeah, this the last previous page.

359
00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:56.669
P3: It cuts the fat, you know. It just gives you what exactly what you need.

360
00:33:57.113 --> 00:34:02.129
P3: whereas this one is, if I'm nervous about doing this for the 1st time, you know.

361
00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:02.700
Hieu: Yeah.

362
00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:20.380
P3: I would like this. I would like this more because it makes me feel at ease that I'm seeing everything, and I can slow it down and make sure everything's great. But if it's my 4th time doing this 5th time, whatever I'm I'm pretty. I'm an expert at it now, more or less. So I can just move along. And just.

363
00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:21.369
Hieu: I gotcha.

364
00:34:21.370 --> 00:34:22.728
P3: Go along my day. Yeah.

365
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:34.410
Hieu: And then in terms of the whole form here on a difficulty, scale of one to 5, 1 being very easy, 5 being very hard. How would you rate this red option.

366
00:34:34.969 --> 00:34:40.989
P3: Oh, yeah, oh, like if I could, I would do one for red and 2 for green.

367
00:34:40.989 --> 00:34:41.949
Hieu: I gotcha.

368
00:34:41.949 --> 00:34:42.739
P3: Yeah.

369
00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:46.440
Hieu: So you adjust the green one just because you're saying this is easier than the green.

370
00:34:46.837 --> 00:34:47.999
P3: Yeah, for sure.

371
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:56.790
Hieu: Gotcha, and then on a efficiency scale, one being very efficient, and then 5 being very inefficient, how would you rate the form you just went through.

372
00:34:56.790 --> 00:35:02.359
P3: Same business. It'll be the same same sort of situation, one for red, 2 for green.

373
00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:04.910
Hieu: Gotcha. All right. Thank you for that.

374
00:35:05.678 --> 00:35:10.889
Hieu: So your overall thoughts for the 2 prototype is that you like red a lot more just because.

375
00:35:10.890 --> 00:35:11.430
P3: Yeah.

376
00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:15.979
Hieu: The overall kind of summary cards has been helpful for you.

377
00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:22.399
P3: Yes, for sure. Yeah. The summary cards, the information from last year's my, my.

378
00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:31.069
P3: my gross income. I think that's what it was asking for right there in front of me. That's that's good. Yeah, red Red just gives you

379
00:35:31.650 --> 00:35:39.249
P3: the the information that's important right then and there, whereas the green is more expanded out.

380
00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:51.339
Hieu: Okay, that makes sense. And then, besides, kind of some of the things that you pointed out, especially the the text portion of it. Is there anything else that you would change about the whole form if you could.

381
00:35:52.524 --> 00:35:57.539
P3: No, no, I don't. I don't think so, even even like this. These notes that

382
00:35:58.131 --> 00:36:08.669
P3: tell me, you know, there's a crime or something like that, I mean, still, I feel like, if everything's relevant is is needed. Yeah. So no real complaints.

383
00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:13.299
Hieu: All right. Thank you for that. And I don't. You no no longer need to share your screen.

384
00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:13.740
Hieu: Okay?

385
00:36:13.988 --> 00:36:15.979
Hieu: So you can stop sharing your screen there.

386
00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:20.829
Hieu: and I do have a couple last questions before we wrap up here.

387
00:36:21.110 --> 00:36:22.030
P3: Yeah, sure.

388
00:36:22.030 --> 00:36:24.820
Hieu: Let me prep my screen.

389
00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:30.649
Hieu: then I'll share my screen.

390
00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:31.970
P3: Okay.

391
00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:38.559
Hieu: So do you see the 3 options.

392
00:36:40.050 --> 00:36:52.409
Hieu: This is kind of the financial information screen here, and of these 3 A, B or C, do you have a preference for one or the other, or you don't really have a preference.

393
00:36:52.560 --> 00:37:01.200
P3: Oh, now that I see a it's got that blue bar which sit which keeps me

394
00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:06.290
P3: aware that, like it it, I know the Va, the colors blue.

395
00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:10.590
P3: and most of the most of the stuff is blue, so I can see why they have that blue bar.

396
00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:18.859
P3: I like that. I like the option. BI like the box the way it looks like, yeah.

397
00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:19.390
Hieu: Yeah.

398
00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:21.079
P3: I do. I do like that one.

399
00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:23.630
Hieu: Okay, can you expand on that a little bit.

400
00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:39.970
P3: I don't know. I it's kind of kind of difficult to say, you know, like I I just like it being in its sort of section. And it's it's it's solidified by the borders that I can. I can see.

401
00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:52.500
P3: It tells me that my information is within this box, so I need to put my full attention within the box. Now. Option C. Yes, within the box, and it's a bit grayed out.

402
00:37:54.170 --> 00:38:00.020
P3: I don't need it to be gray. I need it to be white. Need it just to to like.

403
00:38:01.170 --> 00:38:05.184
P3: not be blurred by the gray? Not have the gray

404
00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:10.319
P3: take my attention away from the letters, you know.

405
00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:11.789
Hieu: Right that makes sense.

406
00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:24.119
P3: So I like. I like the B. But I can see why people would choose A just because of the blue line on the left it. It matches with the other blue on the Va. Website. But I'm sticking with B.

407
00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:26.799
Hieu: Gotcha. That makes sense. All right.

408
00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:36.080
Hieu: then. Compare, I think you already mentioned this before, but this the marital status with the 2 different approaches, and I believe you mentioned you like the.

409
00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:36.990
P3: Yeah.

410
00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:51.826
P3: Yeah. But but now, now, talking about it, you know you, I most of the other Va things they don't really do. The bubbles, you know that it's they usually do. The drop down from my memory serves me right.

411
00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:56.489
Hieu: It depends on the. It depends on the type of questions.

412
00:38:57.460 --> 00:39:01.040
P3: Yeah, jeez.

413
00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:10.369
P3: you know, like discussing it in in detail

414
00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:15.259
P3: with it right in front of me, you know, a versus B

415
00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:24.070
P3: in terms of speed. B is the right one.

416
00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:24.960
Hieu: Okay.

417
00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:28.000
P3: You know. Beans the right one. Yeah. But then.

418
00:39:29.450 --> 00:39:30.960
Hieu: You you go ahead.

419
00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:33.590
P3: It takes me only one click.

420
00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:39.060
P3: you know, to click on my marital status on B, whereas on A,

421
00:39:39.690 --> 00:39:50.909
P3: I gotta do 2 clicks right. I gotta click on the select, and then I gotta click on the which option fits my life right? So I just I just think in in terms of just the amount of clicks.

422
00:39:51.310 --> 00:39:52.810
P3: B would be the right one.

423
00:39:53.130 --> 00:40:00.569
Hieu: Gotcha. But then you're leaning towards it. Be just because you saw it. Familiarity.

424
00:40:00.570 --> 00:40:11.990
P3: I like. I like uniformity right? I like how, if we choose dropdown, then everything's gotta be drop down. If we choose bubbles. Then we gotta do bubbles.

425
00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:23.300
P3: And now, if we're if we're talking about saving space, then the dropdown would be the right one, because it does save space on a static page.

426
00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:24.380
P3: Right?

427
00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:25.640
P3: Right?

428
00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:31.310
P3: I mean, that's that. That's where I lie. Yeah.

429
00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:33.740
Hieu: I got you. Yeah, thank you for that.

430
00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:48.319
Hieu: And then now, if you were so in this scenario, let's say you were married. But when you come to update this, let's say you were divorced, and you change it to divorce. You see this message, and

431
00:40:48.530 --> 00:40:52.629
Hieu: can you kind of walk me through your thought. If you see this message.

432
00:40:53.820 --> 00:41:03.500
P3: Oh, I mean, that's fair. That's that's this warning is a hundred percent fair in my eyes, because it would just mess up like it says we'll delete

433
00:41:03.650 --> 00:41:09.409
P3: any previous spouse information in this form. So I think that

434
00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:16.979
P3: pop up is a requirement, just in case someone, you know, just in case I get divorced, and I don't.

435
00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:19.790
P3: or you know, let's let's say I do mess up.

436
00:41:20.450 --> 00:41:28.050
P3: and this pops up, and it. It just keeps me from deleting all the information. Now, I gotta burn another 5, 10 min putting in

437
00:41:28.050 --> 00:41:30.759
P3: right again. So yeah, this is a good one.

438
00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:35.009
Hieu: You like this, and then it's not confusing to you. It makes sense in your mind.

439
00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:37.170
P3: No, it. It makes sense.

440
00:41:37.350 --> 00:41:46.389
Hieu: Okay, thank you. And then, finally, this last one here, comparing the 2 different financial information.

441
00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:49.600
Hieu: one is the green one is the red. Technically.

442
00:41:50.910 --> 00:42:00.150
P3: Let's see, if your spouse didn't earn any income enter 0,

443
00:42:04.350 --> 00:42:19.280
P3: I still would like to be, I would like to be, part yeah, yeah, for sure. If you're yeah with with that extra information on the growth income from works talking about, if what happens if they don't earn any money enter 0. That's good, that's good.

444
00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:22.640
Hieu: Yeah, okay, that's good to know.

445
00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:25.440
Hieu: And then I want to say, I'll stop there.

446
00:42:25.590 --> 00:42:26.770
Hieu: Let's see.

447
00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:32.790
Hieu: I'll check my colleagues to see if they have any questions, and then for myself.

448
00:42:34.956 --> 00:42:37.449
Hieu: do you have any questions for me?

449
00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:43.260
P3: No negative. I feel like I've answered everything that was on my mind from those pages.

450
00:42:43.390 --> 00:42:55.979
Hieu: Okay. And now, my colleagues, they do not have any questions either. So I wanna circle back and reconfirm that you are comfortable if we choose to share a video clip of this session with our Va partners.

451
00:42:56.410 --> 00:42:58.579
P3: Yes, sir, I'm good. I'm good with it.

452
00:42:58.830 --> 00:43:22.190
Hieu: Okay, just a reminder. We do remove any kind of identifying information. If we do do that, blur out. You know that your screen and your your name and whatnot, and then we kind of conclude the session here. So I wanna say, I appreciate all your time and your thoughts that you know that you share with us today your feedback is helpful as we kind of continue to update and

453
00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:36.740
Hieu: update the site and make it work for all veterans, and then, lastly, Pregn did send will send you a thank you letter with a little blurb that you can pass on to other veterans, who you feel that may provide, or who.

454
00:43:36.890 --> 00:43:42.309
Hieu: you know, that may provide them with a chance to kind of participate in future researches as well.

455
00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:47.729
P3: Okay, yeah, that's cool. I I'm always up for all of this stuff. And yeah, I can pass it to my other vets.

456
00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:49.320
P3: Okay, if they want to do it.

457
00:43:49.630 --> 00:43:52.759
Hieu: Thank you a lot, you know. Enjoy the rest of the day.

458
00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:54.389
P3: Alright. You, too, thank you all.

459
00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:54.990
Hieu: All right.

460
00:43:55.210 --> 00:43:56.870
P3: Have a good one. Bye, bye.
