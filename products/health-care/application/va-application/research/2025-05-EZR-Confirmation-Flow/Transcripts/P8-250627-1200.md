00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:08.930
Hieu: I have started recording, I'd like to confirm that you are comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today.

2
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:09.860
P8: Yes, I am.

3
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.720
Hieu: Okay? And then, are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with our Va partners.

4
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:17.730
P8: Yes, ma'am.

5
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:29.790
Hieu: All right. Thank you. So we've got a couple warm up questions here. Do you have a surface disability? Sorry. My head's a little Jumbo here.

6
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.350
Hieu: Do you have a service-connected disability rating at the Va.

7
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.050
P8: Yes.

8
00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.300
Hieu: And then what is your rating percentage.

9
00:00:39.964 --> 00:00:42.690
P8: It's 90% permanent in total.

10
00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.750
Hieu: And then, have you recently visited the va.gov website?

11
00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:48.450
P8: Yes.

12
00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.020
Hieu: And then may I ask, for what reason?

13
00:00:51.978 --> 00:00:59.415
P8: I. I have both the app and the website to check for my up medical appointments.

14
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:05.220
P8: my mainly from a medical appointment to my pay.

15
00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:06.460
P8: Yeah.

16
00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.570
Hieu: I see, and then you said you use the app as well, so.

17
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.420
P8: Yes.

18
00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.750
Hieu: Oh, okay, thank you.

19
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:29.800
Hieu: Alright. Today you'll be going through 2 different prototype. One is option green and the other one is option red. Imagine that you have one spouse and one dependent. You may have filled out a similar form before, and now they're asking you to update your financial information.

20
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:30.250
P8: Okay.

21
00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:37.800
Hieu: In this scenario you've logged into your va.gov. Account, where the system has pre-filled some of the information for you.

22
00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:45.479
Hieu: and then are you comfortable with sharing your screen as as we talk to the through the process here, alrighty.

23
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:54.969
Hieu: so let me give you the prototype to get into. It will be in the zoom, chat, link.

24
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.150
P8: Okay.

25
00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:09.570
Hieu: And then once you click on that, it'll take a little bit of time to load. And then, in the meantime, if you have any kind of personal information in the browser. If you want to close that, feel free to go ahead like email, Facebook or whatnot.

26
00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.580
P8: Okay, yeah, I just closed my email and.

27
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.779
Hieu: And then to share the to screen share would be in yours, or

28
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.569
Hieu: I just let you do it, and then let me know if you need any help.

29
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.150
Hieu: All right, I see it.

30
00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:35.260
Hieu: And then

31
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.060
Hieu: I see your desktop as well. Do you want to do a full screen on that. So?

32
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.709
Hieu: Or are you okay with it being window size.

33
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:46.449
P8: There you go!

34
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:47.760
Hieu: Alrighty.

35
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.660
Hieu: So for today we will start with the red option.

36
00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.769
Hieu: So if you scroll down.

37
00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.916
P8: Let me!

38
00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:57.839
Hieu: Sure thing.

39
00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.280
Hieu: So if you scroll down.

40
00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.230
P8: -

41
00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.769
P8: Why is it not scrolling?

42
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.470
P8: Sorry?

43
00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.370
Hieu: No worries.

44
00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:31.229
P8: Oh, okay, so I have to hold it and scroll, cause I was like, there's no scrolling bar. Okay.

45
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.740
Hieu: That might be like an awkward demo.

46
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.743
P8: Oh, yeah.

47
00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.350
Hieu: All right. Yeah, go ahead and click on the option red.

48
00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:50.570
Hieu: And then please take a few moments to go through this page. I'd like you to think out loud as much as possible, noting anything that's confusing to you.

49
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:57.980
P8: Okay, see? Location. Id information.

50
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.200
Hieu: Oh, in this scenario you are Riley Smith. By the way.

51
00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:03.440
P8: Okay.

52
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:09.769
P8: let's see.

53
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:19.140
P8: Now, is it possible to later will be possible to edit this

54
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.279
P8: like, say, with the like for me.

55
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.510
P8: case like the birthday, or something's wrong, maybe like an edit box.

56
00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:37.880
Hieu: So you want it to basically be adding or editing that information right here instead of yeah contacting.

57
00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.420
P8: Yes.

58
00:04:40.286 --> 00:04:42.310
Hieu: At the moment. No.

59
00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.839
P8: Okay, yeah. Cause sometimes calling this number.

60
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.920
P8: especially since they're on the east coast.

61
00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.880
Hieu: Yeah.

62
00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.270
P8: You know, you might have have to wait until the next day.

63
00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.861
P8: and I would I would put the i

64
00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:08.550
P8: the application id probably down here, because it's easy to be missed when it's just up here.

65
00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:10.040
Hieu: I gotcha.

66
00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:18.310
Hieu: And then so basically, you want it a way to edit that because you from the

67
00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:26.480
Hieu: your phone experience, because of their East coast hours. They're just closing a lot earlier than you like it them to be.

68
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:31.490
P8: Well, no 9 o'clock is late, but I'm just saying, like some people.

69
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:39.400
P8: or like with me, I do most of my stuff. If I have to do something like this literally in the middle of the night.

70
00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.229
P8: when I have like, it's quiet and it's free time.

71
00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.169
P8: And you could just focus on it

72
00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:58.279
P8: versus the middle of the day. Hey? Some people work. So by the time they get home they have to family to take care of and stuff like that. So by the time it's it's time to settle down, it's probably 9 o'clock.

73
00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.000
P8: California time.

74
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.520
Hieu: I gotcha.

75
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.319
Hieu: I I understand that. And I feel like I operate the same way.

76
00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.450
Hieu: Yeah. And they're like.

77
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.229
P8: So your request, id number.

78
00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.370
P8: I guess.

79
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.619
P8: What would be the difference between that and the application. Id number.

80
00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:20.950
Hieu: Okay.

81
00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:22.710
P8: I would think that would be the same.

82
00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:28.889
P8: Just in case you have to remember something like that

83
00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:36.269
P8: cause it says we saved your request, I would think the request would be the application.

84
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:37.819
Hieu: I gotcha.

85
00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:40.620
P8: Okay, that's it.

86
00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:45.109
Hieu: All right, so we can continue on to the next page if you press, continue there.

87
00:06:45.960 --> 00:07:00.200
Hieu: Yep. And then, as I mentioned before in this scenario. This information came from previous information that you provided for research purposes. You're going through this form to make sure the fill in are accurate and make sense.

88
00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:06.870
P8: Okay, yeah, that would be. That's good thing.

89
00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:23.989
P8: I mean, this one's pretty straightforward. I don't see any required changes.

90
00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:25.580
Hieu: Okay.

91
00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.710
P8: Because, having it, each separate helps

92
00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.340
P8: you know, it helps the person.

93
00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:35.240
Hieu: Right.

94
00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:39.819
P8: Had to edit all but just like the phone number. And all this other stuff. Yeah.

95
00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:40.750
Hieu: Alright.

96
00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:43.619
Hieu: That makes sense all right. You can continue.

97
00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:47.570
P8: Okay.

98
00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:55.820
P8: hmm.

99
00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:15.559
P8: okay, pretty straightforward. Or why?

100
00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:18.579
P8: Why this needs to be done.

101
00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.889
Hieu: Okay, can move along.

102
00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:32.570
P8: Hmm!

103
00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:49.749
P8: I mean, I would think it'll probably a little more information should be on the on the preview

104
00:08:50.480 --> 00:09:00.470
P8: editing like birthday, like the same way. The veterans information 1st name, last name birthday.

105
00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:03.349
P8: and so last 4 of the social.

106
00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:04.050
Hieu: I got.

107
00:09:04.527 --> 00:09:07.390
P8: Edit, and go through all that.

108
00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:10.870
Hieu: I gotcha that makes sense.

109
00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:15.079
Hieu: So you want a little bit more information on the spouse card here.

110
00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:16.020
P8: Yes.

111
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:19.540
Hieu: Alright that makes sense. Then anything else.

112
00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:20.960
P8: No, that's it.

113
00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:23.720
Hieu: Okay, continue.

114
00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:01.730
P8: So

115
00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:14.249
P8: I would think that they will put the ad dependent or or

116
00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:20.300
P8: the dependent, you know, to add, dependent with the same on the same page as this

117
00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:41.450
P8: explanation stuff, because if it's on the next page and they don't have this explanation, people have to go back to reread the explanation, and then go forward to finish out. And if it's not saving the information that is put in for the dependent, that's a lot of back and forth. So the dependent card on the same page as this one.

118
00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:45.600
Hieu: So this intro area is a little bit awkward to you, essentially.

119
00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.280
P8: Yeah.

120
00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:52.100
Hieu: You want it more specifically, just the functionality of it. You want more to it.

121
00:10:52.410 --> 00:11:02.340
P8: Yeah. Cause if you, it's like how the spouse one is, you should put the dependent one just like that, because it's easier, and it condenses the app, or condenses the form

122
00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:08.650
P8: to be less than you know, than having to keep going, going, going.

123
00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:09.550
Hieu: Right?

124
00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:11.229
Hieu: That makes sense.

125
00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:14.380
Hieu: Go ahead.

126
00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:23.045
P8: So like all this could be saved onto the other page without having to.

127
00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:30.890
P8: Yeah, because the information of being like it's here.

128
00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:34.570
P8: But

129
00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:43.140
P8: I don't know. It just seems extra. It's like extra for no reason when all this could be on the same page with the same information

130
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:47.009
P8: versus having a whole second page to do this.

131
00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:51.870
P8: So yeah.

132
00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:55.100
Hieu: I gotcha. Yeah, thank you for that feedback.

133
00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:10.099
P8: and with this one, I would I would think that if they press yes, it automatically formates

134
00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:22.500
P8: the what's deductible the information that's required. If they're pretty snow, then they can continue, but they press. Yes, to have the fields pop up afterwards.

135
00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:31.020
Hieu: So like a similar feedback to the dependent, where you want it to be more dynamic, and you want

136
00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:33.889
Hieu: more functionality on this single page.

137
00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:34.860
P8: Yes.

138
00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:36.290
Hieu: That makes sense.

139
00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:39.000
Hieu: You're good.

140
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:39.800
Hieu: Can you hear.

141
00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:45.509
P8: Oh, yeah, cause that way, it's all there together without having to worry.

142
00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:46.310
Hieu: Right

143
00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:59.800
Hieu: for this section. I'll give you financial information that you'll need for this scenario. You and your spouse work and salary has not changed since 2023 to 2,024.

144
00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:00.390
P8: Okay.

145
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:08.000
Hieu: And then, generally this information you'll collect from your either W. 2 or

146
00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:13.299
Hieu: medical expenses that you kept track of essentially.

147
00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:14.620
P8: Okay.

148
00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:27.660
Hieu: And then, since this is a demo, you won't be able to like type in actual numbers, but if you click in it it will pre fill for, or they will fill it. The information for you.

149
00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:29.150
P8: Okay.

150
00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:34.430
P8: the

151
00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:47.220
P8: okay. So now you have a little error right there.

152
00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:53.330
P8: So I think with this one.

153
00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:00.100
P8: these should be collapsible

154
00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:05.479
P8: like, hey? Like, if you do your taxes, they have a collapse like. If you if you qualify.

155
00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:14.299
P8: then you can fill it in. If you don't qualify, it's condensed. So if you have noticed, I'm about condensing everything. And

156
00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:17.998
P8: yeah, we need it because it saves space from

157
00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:21.149
P8: having to keep scrolling, scrolling, scrolling.

158
00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:22.909
Hieu: Right. You want it. Dynamic.

159
00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:28.299
P8: Yeah, you only access what you are actually need, like, the other income could be condensed.

160
00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:34.059
P8: Unless you you know, if the person doesn't, then they don't have to worry about this.

161
00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:43.810
P8: and I don't think the what is it? Other income should be required

162
00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:48.889
P8: if they don't have it, cause. That's I mean, yeah, they could put 0. But

163
00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:54.150
P8: if they don't have it, it's just like it's just extra.

164
00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:55.070
Hieu: Where.

165
00:14:56.210 --> 00:15:00.055
P8: I know it's a small little thing. But yeah.

166
00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:02.720
Hieu: Okay, yeah, I hear you.

167
00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:37.429
P8: And the same thing about having it as a as a condensed, and be able.

168
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:38.160
Hieu: Right.

169
00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:39.419
P8: Arrow down. So

170
00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:17.419
P8: this should probably be in bold

171
00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:23.099
P8: cause if somebody just reading this, they're like, okay, but

172
00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:29.290
P8: making sure that they know that it's only stuff that your health insurance hasn't paid back for the cost.

173
00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:33.080
Hieu: I gotcha? Yeah, because you think that's the most important.

174
00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:35.849
Hieu: That explanation.

175
00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:37.150
P8: Yes.

176
00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:38.040
Hieu: Okay.

177
00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:41.699
P8: Cause. If if any like for me, I skim through stuff.

178
00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:45.650
P8: and I absorb just like the important stuff.

179
00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:50.110
P8: But if it's like this, it will blend together.

180
00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:51.280
Hieu: Gotcha.

181
00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:54.310
P8: Hmm!

182
00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:04.319
P8: And the same thing with condensing each section.

183
00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:10.250
P8: So if they don't have it, they don't have to worry about the college and all this other stuff.

184
00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:11.589
Hieu: I gotcha.

185
00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:28.090
P8: Definitely like Bolding this, so they know not to include dependents.

186
00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:40.099
Hieu: And then let's pause right here.

187
00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:40.770
P8: Okay.

188
00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:46.709
Hieu: Was any of that part confusing to you, or any part in this financial section confusing to you.

189
00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:50.310
P8: No, no, no, like. If you know this information.

190
00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:57.620
Hieu: And you keep track of it. It's kind of like doing your taxes. Yeah, most veterans have been doing their taxes since they were like.

191
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.310
P8: 1819. So you're used to putting stuff in certain boxes.

192
00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:06.690
P8: So it's like, kind of like a muscle memory thing.

193
00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:14.350
Hieu: I gotcha. And then, when you solve that kind of 2023 financial numbers, the one in the gray box

194
00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:19.330
Hieu: did it help you decide what to do next, or did it make you second guess if it's current.

195
00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:30.360
P8: Well, so if I was somebody that if the stuff was, I would double check, just to make sure

196
00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:35.420
P8: that my my education, expenses and stuff like that are still the same.

197
00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:47.070
P8: But I think because you told me that we can't edit it. And it's already pre-filled. I was like, okay, what this goes here. But I know a lot of this. If it's not

198
00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:59.720
P8: like the medical expenses, I definitely know that can change based off medication that you have to pay for, or things like travel, time, and

199
00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:06.080
P8: stuff that qualifies within the expenses that would definitely be changing a lot

200
00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:10.070
P8: from year to year, so you'll you'll be on the lookout for that more.

201
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:14.970
Hieu: Yes, I gotcha, and then honest, go ahead.

202
00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:25.500
P8: I'll say the same with education, because things change. Books change. College expenses change because you're not taking the same classes. You were the year before.

203
00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:26.170
Hieu: Right.

204
00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:34.940
Hieu: and then with that, then do you find the gray box to be helpful or not? Really because you expect it to change.

205
00:19:35.615 --> 00:19:38.970
P8: I find it helpful. So you know what you're looking at?

206
00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:49.610
P8: yeah, I find it helpful. Just because it's it's a it's a

207
00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:56.959
P8: It's like a precursor to what you have to make sure that you're covering.

208
00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:08.899
P8: Okay? Last year I did 4, 30, and if the person's organized, they have the information from the year prior to to know what to look for for the the year currently.

209
00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:13.570
Hieu: I got you. It sets you up mentally to I Gotcha.

210
00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:27.579
Hieu: and then on a scale of one to 5, 1 being very easy and 5 being very hard. How difficult would it be for you to complete this financial information section if you were to do this with real information.

211
00:20:29.081 --> 00:20:30.467
P8: I would say

212
00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:47.179
P8: of 3, just because I have to make sure that I find all the incorrect information, financial, wise, like any receipts that I need to bring up, or any documentation from receipts. Invoices.

213
00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:56.549
P8: If I'm taking Ubers to my appointment that I know have not been refunded from the Travel Department. Make sure I have that activity and stuff, and then

214
00:20:57.090 --> 00:21:00.939
P8: having to add all that stuff together. And yeah.

215
00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:04.753
Hieu: I gotcha. So in terms of the actual

216
00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:17.790
Hieu: prototype here, or the flow itself, it wasn't too difficult, but it's the process in kind of collecting these financial data. That's more time consuming and could be difficult.

217
00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:19.510
P8: For some. Yeah.

218
00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:22.300
Hieu: Yeah, I see that. Okay, that makes sense.

219
00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:32.840
Hieu: And then, besides, your kind of collapsible and condensing, do you have any suggestions or feedback to make the page or update process better.

220
00:21:33.956 --> 00:21:40.100
P8: No, it's pretty standard type. Flow for va app.

221
00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:42.340
Hieu: Okay. Gotcha.

222
00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:48.240
P8: But maybe let's see. Yeah, this way.

223
00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:50.580
P8: So

224
00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:58.638
P8: hmm, okay, the counter right here.

225
00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:00.719
Hieu: You're not a fan.

226
00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:07.479
P8: No, because it's like, Oh, okay, 2 or 3. So you're like, okay, I'm almost done. But then you realize it's still on 2 like

227
00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:12.289
P8: for for pages over.

228
00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:13.410
Hieu: Gotcha.

229
00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:27.049
P8: So having an ideal of how many that you actually have to finish, gives a person, or maybe a person? Yeah, gives a person a time timeframe of how long they should sit down and finish this, or give themselves.

230
00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:33.549
P8: you know, mental mental capacity of how long it's going to take them to finish it.

231
00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:34.360
Hieu: Right.

232
00:22:34.685 --> 00:22:51.289
P8: Like. If the whole application and nothing changes, it could take a person 20 min. But if you have changes and stuff, it could take maybe 45 to an hour. So that person knows that. Hey, I need to finish this. I need at least an hour just to focus

233
00:22:51.590 --> 00:23:04.829
P8: to get the numbers in and anything and add anything to change or delete like dependents and stuff, because the dependents only up until 23. So if I gotta delete dependents or add a dependent and make sure they have all their information.

234
00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:07.719
P8: such as social and all the other things.

235
00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:11.720
Hieu: Okay, yeah, yeah, thank you for that feedback.

236
00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:15.220
P8: But other than that.

237
00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:19.380
Hieu: Okay, then we can continue.

238
00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:20.210
P8: Okay.

239
00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:22.810
P8: But you see, like, with the collapsible.

240
00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:23.410
Hieu: Yes.

241
00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:24.650
P8: Keep scrolling down.

242
00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:29.959
Hieu: This is a long, a very long page.

243
00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:35.780
P8: Yeah. So this is like, I mean, granted, it's on the phone, and you're probably doing it with your fingers. But still.

244
00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:36.400
Hieu: Right.

245
00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:39.640
P8: It's like, okay, let me keep going. Keep going. Okay?

246
00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:43.220
P8: And then review.

247
00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:50.390
P8: Hmm, that's fine.

248
00:23:54.870 --> 00:24:01.069
P8: Yeah, I don't see any work like real changes I need from here, because it's basically telling exactly what you input it.

249
00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:02.220
Hieu: Okay.

250
00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:03.750
Hieu: Sounds good.

251
00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:11.029
P8: It's a

252
00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:32.240
P8: how many spaces.

253
00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:33.896
Hieu: It's too

254
00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:37.830
P8: Like.

255
00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:38.370
Hieu: Yeah.

256
00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:46.860
P8: I. It doesn't need this, the line 3. At the most. People use the line 2 to add the apartment number or suite number and stuff like that.

257
00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:50.530
P8: But it does in the align. 3.

258
00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:56.680
P8: yeah, yeah, that's a lot for just one address.

259
00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:10.340
P8: Yeah. The same thing with the mailing address.

260
00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:22.410
P8: and I think if the font was maybe a little smaller, it could all fit like, have it

261
00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:25.390
P8: not lined up, but probably under.

262
00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:26.820
Hieu: Gotcha.

263
00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:32.239
Hieu: It's a little bit of reorganization in the this accordion setup here.

264
00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:32.980
P8: Yes.

265
00:25:34.090 --> 00:25:41.810
P8: like have. Maybe like, if somebody has a long street name, because I know, like places in Hawaii and stuff have long street names.

266
00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:44.860
Hieu: It would be better just for it to.

267
00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:48.210
P8: Adjust font wise to fit it in.

268
00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:48.950
Hieu: Right.

269
00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:54.810
P8: And then, if needed, go to the second level. But yeah, cause this shouldn't take up 2 levels.

270
00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:03.900
P8: Same thing with this. The font can just be across.

271
00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:09.679
P8: and the No can be right under, and that will save at least half an inch worth of space.

272
00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:10.630
Hieu: Right.

273
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:23.150
P8: Yeah, same thing with the email

274
00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:27.909
P8: and stuff. The alignment could just be underneath.

275
00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:31.209
P8: Okay, so household.

276
00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:47.599
Hieu: You just think that this review thing is too spread out. It can be.

277
00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:48.070
P8: Yeah.

278
00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:48.940
Hieu: Condense.

279
00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:51.480
Hieu: Gotcha.

280
00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:57.730
P8: Yeah, cause it's gonna like, I think it's just the font in the settings, like.

281
00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:01.189
Hieu: That that big circles might be on me.

282
00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:07.479
P8: And she's like, Okay, I didn't wait.

283
00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:11.485
P8: What is? Yeah, it's just weird.

284
00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:29.809
P8: So like all this information would have been in the edit part of the Spouse.

285
00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:31.620
Hieu: Correct.

286
00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:32.740
P8: Okay.

287
00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:42.030
Hieu: Your the clock, or something is turning your head. Can you elaborate.

288
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:43.425
P8: Hmm,

289
00:27:44.290 --> 00:28:00.933
P8: oh, sorry. Okay, so like, when we did the spouse page. It just says Spouse 1st name, last name married. It didn't give the date of the marriage like, if the preview actually showed things like, okay, date of marriage.

290
00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:07.870
P8: just a little synopsis of just like these questions in the preview box.

291
00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:18.069
P8: so that when they come back to them they're like, Oh, you know, instead of like, okay, they can verify it then without having to collect it. Click the edit button.

292
00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:21.645
P8: because I know all this stuff wasn't on there.

293
00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:22.610
Hieu: Gotcha.

294
00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:23.250
P8: Like he's.

295
00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:27.239
Hieu: The spouse card have, like way, too few information you want.

296
00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:27.880
P8: Right.

297
00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:30.900
Hieu: A synopsis of almost everything in there.

298
00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:31.880
P8: Yes.

299
00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:33.090
Hieu: Gotcha.

300
00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:43.650
P8: Because it that way they can check in like, okay, I don't have to edit this, but we just it's saying the 1st or last name and married.

301
00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:49.129
P8: The person will have to go to the extra step to press edit to verify all the information.

302
00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:52.069
P8: That's a lot.

303
00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:53.140
Hieu: Yeah.

304
00:28:54.130 --> 00:28:57.420
P8: Okay, so like same thing.

305
00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:22.139
P8: That's fine.

306
00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:27.689
P8: I think, like I was saying before, it's just the whole.

307
00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:33.890
Hieu: Right, write the question across instead of indenting it to the side. There.

308
00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:34.510
P8: Yes.

309
00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:04.850
P8: I'm pretty sure that was 4, 94, 4, 4, 96.

310
00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:16.820
Hieu: That's actually a pretty good catch. So I'll stop you right there. So in this scenario you realize that one of your expense is incorrect, and you had a big

311
00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:46.579
Hieu: out of pocket dental operation last year of $3,000. And I think you you basically kind of caught it before in the previous one. How you mentioned that expense from year to year technically changes a lot. So that's a number that you'll notice more often, or at least be aware of, and I'm curious. Where would you change? More likely to change it in this one, or in the previous, like gray box like? Where would you most likely be.

312
00:30:47.719 --> 00:30:54.340
P8: The previous, because this is just reviewing. So I would think that this should automatically be.

313
00:30:55.680 --> 00:31:01.724
Hieu: But okay. So if I'm finding out now, after I finish everything else, I will edit. Now.

314
00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:16.080
Hieu: It's pretty straightforward for you, but I think you'll catch that beforehand, or not catch, but at least because you expect the medical expense to be different. That's where you'll do your review then.

315
00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:22.679
P8: Yes, so I mean, like, if I put in 4, 96 prior to. And then, after I

316
00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:29.809
P8: get through all this, I remember. Like you said I have this one expense, then I will edit it on this page.

317
00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:30.570
Hieu: Right.

318
00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:33.839
P8: That reflects what the new number is.

319
00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:34.940
Hieu: Gotcha

320
00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:50.499
Hieu: good eye. By the way, I was like oh, you caught it so for a difficulty, rating of one to 5, 1 being very easy, and 5 being very hard, how would you rate the form? You just went through the entire form.

321
00:31:51.030 --> 00:31:53.740
P8: Oh, 2.

322
00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:54.770
Hieu: A 2.

323
00:31:55.836 --> 00:32:02.260
P8: The minor stuff as such as like, the spouse information with the editing.

324
00:32:02.410 --> 00:32:03.255
P8: Yeah.

325
00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:11.070
P8: Some people would just rush through it and not take the time to revise it until they get to the end.

326
00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:20.859
P8: So that gives that makes people have to take the extra time to fix anything like. Maybe they got divorced, or maybe the person moved, or something like that.

327
00:32:21.290 --> 00:32:22.220
Hieu: Gotcha.

328
00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:32.739
Hieu: and then in terms of efficiency, on a scale of one to 5, 1 being very efficient and 5 being very inefficient, how would you rate the entire form you just went through.

329
00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:50.759
P8: just the minor cosmic and certain things. I give it a 3. I want to say 2 and a half, 3 just because a lot a lot of it can be space saved like minimalized

330
00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:53.870
P8: in the format.

331
00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:54.760
Hieu: I got you.

332
00:32:54.760 --> 00:33:04.599
P8: It more easy flow for people who are crunching on time, or don't have the attention span to go through everything like that.

333
00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:08.000
P8: Yeah.

334
00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:13.180
Hieu: I gotcha alright, and then I think you can scroll down to the bottom here.

335
00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:19.680
Hieu: Yeah, there's a button that says End Demo, and it'll end this prototype.

336
00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:20.270
P8: Oh!

337
00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:23.710
Hieu: Okay.

338
00:33:24.250 --> 00:33:39.589
Hieu: So now that we completed the red options, we'll move on to the green option. And in this option some screen will be the same, and some will be different. I do note that you know some of your comment will apply to this section as well.

339
00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:40.770
P8: Okay.

340
00:33:40.770 --> 00:33:42.359
Hieu: So go ahead and go in green.

341
00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:50.740
P8: Alright.

342
00:33:51.250 --> 00:33:52.150
P8: Yeah.

343
00:33:52.290 --> 00:33:55.109
P8: Same thing with the edit button. But other than that.

344
00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:59.450
P8: I mean, I understand why you need to call for the safety.

345
00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:08.629
P8: but we can edit a lot of our stuff on our on our Va. Accounts, like our deposits and things like that.

346
00:34:09.170 --> 00:34:10.130
Hieu: Right.

347
00:34:10.139 --> 00:34:14.249
P8: So. But I mean, if it's wrong, like

348
00:34:14.449 --> 00:34:24.669
P8: sometimes people don't use their va.gov accounts a lot, or at all, and certain things can be wrong like they were misspelling my middle name for a very long time.

349
00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:25.650
Hieu: I got you.

350
00:34:25.659 --> 00:34:31.569
P8: So I started frequently using it and updated everything I didn't even know. So

351
00:34:33.199 --> 00:34:35.999
P8: yeah, time to call. It's just it's

352
00:34:36.409 --> 00:34:39.869
P8: I get the security reason. But then I'm also like, Hmm!

353
00:34:40.439 --> 00:34:41.969
P8: Make it easy for us.

354
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:44.100
Hieu: Gotcha.

355
00:34:44.610 --> 00:34:45.429
P8: Okay.

356
00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:53.440
P8: okay, knowledge is outside the box.

357
00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:04.489
P8: I like this way better, because it's easier to change

358
00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:09.560
P8: anything change like, I say, you can remove the street line

359
00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:13.710
P8: are the the line 3 is usually unnecessary.

360
00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:19.404
P8: unless you're doing like

361
00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:26.130
P8: What is it? The c slash? O to such and such.

362
00:35:26.530 --> 00:35:27.370
Hieu: Right.

363
00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:33.030
P8: Then that could just that can be replaced with like, just like a little plus sign, in case you have to add it.

364
00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:34.309
Hieu: I gotcha.

365
00:35:35.170 --> 00:35:36.170
P8: Okay.

366
00:35:36.735 --> 00:35:44.309
P8: so with this one, instead of going to the next page to fill in the mailing address, it could be on the same page.

367
00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:48.099
P8: So it's still together.

368
00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:56.879
P8: Yeah, so like, this could be on the other page

369
00:35:57.790 --> 00:36:00.990
P8: that way. A person could just do it all at once.

370
00:36:03.569 --> 00:36:14.640
P8: So like if they press. Yes, it doesn't formulate. The fields don't formulate, but if they press no, then the fields will formulate for them to enter into the information.

371
00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:15.590
Hieu: Gotcha.

372
00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:27.949
P8: Or even a drop a drop down box area? Because it is pre-filled from the applications that the that are already, or the information that's already in the system.

373
00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:28.870
Hieu: Right.

374
00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:32.940
P8: Yeah.

375
00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:42.048
P8: And once again, you know, just so close to knows.

376
00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:43.890
Hieu: The step indicator.

377
00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:44.710
P8: Yeah.

378
00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:53.429
P8: And that's simple.

379
00:36:54.047 --> 00:37:02.969
Hieu: Okay? And then do you? So you mentioned that you like this page to page option instead of the overview card option before.

380
00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:17.990
P8: Yeah, because it gives you it automatically puts your mind in like, okay, wait. I need to change this, you know, or I need to add that I have a new home phone number, or I, just, I have a new mobile number.

381
00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:21.200
Hieu: Gotcha. So you want to see that. And then

382
00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:23.939
Hieu: if it's right there, you can just change it right away.

383
00:37:24.730 --> 00:37:25.650
Hieu: Gotcha.

384
00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:36.230
P8: It cuts the step of having to go from edit box, from edit, unless the edit, when you click, edit it automatically. Open the Fields versus going to another page.

385
00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:37.300
Hieu: Gotcha.

386
00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:47.000
P8: You know, like some places have some apps. Have it to where it's grayed out, so you don't accidentally put a number in and you click edit, and then they become active fields.

387
00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:47.900
Hieu: Gotcha.

388
00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:54.250
P8: And

389
00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:14.560
P8: so if it goes married, I would to streamline it. Streamline it. It'll be like, Okay, you're married. And then spousal information.

390
00:38:15.490 --> 00:38:20.329
Hieu: Just like your feedback from before. How you want this to be on the same screen.

391
00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:21.220
P8: Yes.

392
00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:23.040
Hieu: Dynamically, yeah.

393
00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:27.659
P8: So just like never never married. They can continue if they're separated.

394
00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:35.480
P8: I don't know if they're still kind of the same household by divorced and widowed.

395
00:38:36.330 --> 00:38:37.240
P8: Yeah.

396
00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:38.660
Hieu: Gotcha.

397
00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:47.259
P8: Yeah, it's like all this could be added to the previous page.

398
00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:50.330
P8: Session.

399
00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:56.360
P8: birthday marriage. Yeah.

400
00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:04.930
P8: And maybe the the spouse's mailing address and information of that nature.

401
00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:17.679
P8: if it's different, like, does this person live with you? If it's yes, and they can continue next thing, if no, then you know. Please enter current address and current mailing address and stuff like that.

402
00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:23.886
P8: Yeah, basically, all this.

403
00:39:24.350 --> 00:39:28.499
Hieu: But you'll want that on one page, and then that way

404
00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:30.659
Hieu: you're saving. You're condensing it essentially.

405
00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:38.669
P8: So that way, it's like, Okay, I have my spouse's information instead of just each step going, going, going, going, going.

406
00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:39.420
Hieu: Right.

407
00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:44.820
P8: Like, okay, do you?

408
00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:50.169
P8: If it's no, then you know how many months of the year

409
00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:58.480
P8: did you and your spouse live together? And then do you currently have the same age? If it's no, then it should formulate

410
00:39:59.650 --> 00:40:02.749
P8: the fields for their address

411
00:40:07.970 --> 00:40:13.770
P8: cause it's like it doesn't come up. So it's like, Where do you put your spouse's address?

412
00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:19.440
P8: Hold on. I'm trying to make sure it wasn't on other pages.

413
00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:23.899
P8: Can I go back.

414
00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:25.020
Hieu: Yeah, you can go back.

415
00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:34.370
P8: Yeah, okay, so it wasn't. Yeah. So I would think the address would be with, those questions will be on.

416
00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:34.720
Hieu: He's not.

417
00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:36.030
P8: Process the information.

418
00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:40.990
P8: Okay,

419
00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:50.679
P8: So it says, did you provide financial support, even though you didn't live together? No, okay.

420
00:40:58.670 --> 00:41:07.469
P8: And I know this is just a demo, but like having the little, the columns, the semicolon, so.

421
00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:11.140
Hieu: Like the punctuation.

422
00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:12.029
P8: Yeah.

423
00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:28.219
P8: Now, if a person press, yes, does it formulate? You know, if the person press? Yes, and I think it should formulate what financial support. They

424
00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:30.590
P8: applied.

425
00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:35.240
Hieu: Right? Essentially going back to what you want. More dynamic.

426
00:41:36.510 --> 00:41:37.350
Hieu: Flows.

427
00:41:37.590 --> 00:41:46.149
P8: Yeah, like this should all be with the spouse's information, not after you ask the financial support.

428
00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:49.470
P8: Like to add up order.

429
00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:57.959
P8: Okay, the same with the dependent.

430
00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:12.939
P8: Having like, not you like. Instead of having this, it could just have the add dependent button.

431
00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:20.660
Hieu: Instead of asking the question, do you have another dependent report? You want like add another dependent.

432
00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:21.390
P8: Hmm.

433
00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:22.160
Hieu: Gotcha.

434
00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:24.420
P8: Yeah, because it's like, okay.

435
00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:40.159
P8: it's easier just to click it. Add, you know, have the fields pop up, add information, submit, and go that way versus if a person does this and they press. Yes, they got 6 kids, so do they have to press. Yes, every single time. That's like.

436
00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:40.870
Hieu: I got you.

437
00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:42.040
P8: Times to add it.

438
00:42:53.980 --> 00:43:03.469
P8: Okay, so this is better than having the gray box information from previous years.

439
00:43:05.590 --> 00:43:06.950
Hieu: You're saying, this is better.

440
00:43:07.010 --> 00:43:11.259
P8: Well, unless a person wants to see the difference.

441
00:43:12.430 --> 00:43:14.600
P8: This gives a blank slate

442
00:43:19.570 --> 00:43:30.939
P8: of of what they yeah. So this gives a this gives the bank blank slate.

443
00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:33.660
Hieu: Of what they can input.

444
00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:42.329
P8: Versus of having the information from previous years.

445
00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:47.959
Hieu: So you didn't find the great box to be really that helpful? Then.

446
00:43:48.330 --> 00:43:55.910
P8: I mean, it's it may be helpful for some that want to know what they put in last year, so they can verify.

447
00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:56.770
Hieu: Right.

448
00:43:58.090 --> 00:44:02.810
Hieu: But for yourself you didn't find that particularly helpful. If you were to do this yourself.

449
00:44:05.050 --> 00:44:16.990
P8: I'm kinda on the fence. I like the great boxes with information, but I also like the clean slate of just knowing just to put in what what is focused for 2024. So let's just say.

450
00:44:16.990 --> 00:44:17.420
Hieu: Okay. Yeah.

451
00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:20.770
P8: I like it for the for to focus on 2024.

452
00:44:20.770 --> 00:44:21.810
Hieu: I gotcha.

453
00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:24.029
P8: Or the current year. Yeah.

454
00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:31.089
Hieu: Yep. Go ahead. You can continue.

455
00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:37.160
P8: And hopefully the the

456
00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:40.185
P8: The app doesn't keep going to the bottom.

457
00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:49.810
Hieu: I mean, I think this would be the same thing. So you would have the same kind of feedback here.

458
00:44:49.810 --> 00:44:50.360
P8: Yes.

459
00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:53.369
Hieu: With a clean slate versus the reference.

460
00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:54.490
P8: Yes.

461
00:45:04.660 --> 00:45:06.290
P8: yeah, it's so expensive.

462
00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:08.070
P8: Okay.

463
00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:12.769
P8: the same thing.

464
00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:15.010
Hieu: Okay.

465
00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:23.819
P8: You know, bold, like Bold, entering the information.

466
00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:33.780
Hieu: And then how was this financial section compared to the previous one?

467
00:45:35.170 --> 00:45:38.669
P8: It was. It was actually, it was actually quite faster.

468
00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:42.909
Hieu: Okay. So without the reference, or you think it's faster.

469
00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:44.240
P8: Yes.

470
00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:46.580
Hieu: Gotcha. Did I do something?

471
00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:50.650
Hieu: Now? I think it just might take a longer time to load this one.

472
00:45:51.030 --> 00:45:58.749
Hieu: We can talk while it loads. So on a scale of one to 5, 1 being very easy and 5 being very hard, how hard would it

473
00:45:58.990 --> 00:46:04.899
Hieu: would it be for you to complete this financial information if you were to do it with real information, with the.

474
00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:08.959
Hieu: The same rating, you know different, easier, harder.

475
00:46:09.301 --> 00:46:16.128
P8: Yeah to, because you still have to figure out the information. For if you adding or subtracting a dependent like.

476
00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:21.320
P8: and then adding for the financials. The financials part will always be the most

477
00:46:22.110 --> 00:46:25.763
P8: complicated to know what you can and cannot

478
00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:31.030
P8: add in there, especially when it comes to the the expenses.

479
00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:31.960
Hieu: Gotcha.

480
00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:46.429
P8: So that will always be, you know, frustrating for some frustrating for most, because you have to make sure, especially if they want proof. You gotta make sure that you have the correct information receipts and everything like that.

481
00:46:46.630 --> 00:46:48.826
Hieu: Gotcha, and then

482
00:46:50.020 --> 00:46:55.989
Hieu: so on a on a scale of one to 5, I think you saying it's the same as before. Then.

483
00:46:55.990 --> 00:46:56.750
P8: Yes.

484
00:46:56.750 --> 00:47:02.419
Hieu: Okay, I got you. I think I want to say you said a 3, but you know I could check that again.

485
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.889
P8: I think I said a 2 for that part.

486
00:47:05.890 --> 00:47:06.600
Hieu: Okay?

487
00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:08.750
Hieu: And then for the overall.

488
00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:10.250
P8: Was the 3? Yes.

489
00:47:10.250 --> 00:47:18.249
Hieu: Gotcha, and then, in terms of efficiency, would you say we are rated the same thing as before? Or would you.

490
00:47:18.250 --> 00:47:20.420
P8: Which was which was the 3.

491
00:47:20.570 --> 00:47:35.810
Hieu: Gotcha, all right. That makes sense. You know, it doesn't really matter that this loads or not, because it's the same screen where you collapse, and then you view it. It's the last screen where it has the end. Demo button. It's identical.

492
00:47:35.810 --> 00:47:36.510
P8: Okay.

493
00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:43.120
Hieu: Now, what would your what is your overall thought about the 2 prototypes we just went through.

494
00:47:43.810 --> 00:47:53.690
P8: I mean, I I like the the thought of it just a lot more minimalizing this. The spaces use usage

495
00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:55.206
P8: for people

496
00:47:56.190 --> 00:48:07.940
P8: like, I've worked with vets, and being a vet, we like things to just be cut to, you know, cut down to the minimum so we can get it done and out out of order. Anything extra just seems

497
00:48:09.410 --> 00:48:10.069
P8: obsolete.

498
00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:17.019
Hieu: And then of the 2 prototype which one would you prefer to see on the va.gov.

499
00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:18.349
P8: The green one.

500
00:48:18.350 --> 00:48:19.870
Hieu: The green one. Okay?

501
00:48:20.770 --> 00:48:21.423
Hieu: And then

502
00:48:21.950 --> 00:48:28.329
Hieu: that's because you'd like things laid out more for you to kind of change or see it and then change.

503
00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:33.940
P8: Without having, and then come towards the end. We'll have the edit button in case I have to edit anything.

504
00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:34.880
Hieu: Gotcha.

505
00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:42.589
Hieu: And then, if there is anything that you could change about the whole form that you could, what do you have, or what would it be.

506
00:48:42.770 --> 00:48:45.189
P8: I think most of it's just cosmetic.

507
00:48:45.610 --> 00:49:01.411
P8: like I was saying about how moving spousal information on to one page. If if somebody answers, yes, then certain fields should be formulated. If they answer no, then they can just press next.

508
00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:08.549
P8: just be able to know how many steps I actually do have to go through to get things done.

509
00:49:08.770 --> 00:49:12.200
Hieu: I like the estimate timeframe right?

510
00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:19.390
Hieu: Alright. Thank you for that. I think you can stop screen sharing now and then. I'll share my own screen.

511
00:49:19.650 --> 00:49:23.070
Hieu: We have a couple of things left before wrapping this up.

512
00:49:23.230 --> 00:49:25.280
P8: Okay. Should I close the demo.

513
00:49:25.893 --> 00:49:27.760
Hieu: Yes, if you yes, please.

514
00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:28.480
P8: Okay.

515
00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:34.330
Hieu: Alright, and then do you see my screen.

516
00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:35.150
P8: Yes.

517
00:49:36.070 --> 00:49:39.239
Hieu: Alright. Let me get this set up first.st

518
00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:53.639
Hieu: So let's take a look at these 3 different options, showcasing your personal information in a different way. Can you walk through your thoughts here? Do you have a preference for which one you like best? A, B or C.

519
00:49:54.010 --> 00:50:00.260
P8: Oh, I see, just because the gray box is more appealing.

520
00:50:00.610 --> 00:50:01.310
Hieu: Hmm!

521
00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:03.520
Hieu: So visually more appealing.

522
00:50:05.180 --> 00:50:08.159
Hieu: And then any thoughts on A, or B.

523
00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:14.490
P8: BI mean, a person could just scan through it a

524
00:50:14.910 --> 00:50:22.479
P8: granted they can. The blue, the blue bar does help visual focus attention on the information.

525
00:50:22.610 --> 00:50:26.459
P8: But person will probably just still scan through and be like, okay, continue.

526
00:50:26.460 --> 00:50:29.140
Hieu: I gotcha. All right. Thank you for that.

527
00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:32.329
Hieu: And then the next portion is the marital status

528
00:50:32.550 --> 00:50:39.999
Hieu: again. It's just the same information, but showcased in 2 different ways. One's a dropdown, and one is more of a bubble toggle.

529
00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:43.888
P8: I like the drop down space.

530
00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:48.169
Hieu: I gotcha you like the more minimal or.

531
00:50:48.660 --> 00:50:49.450
P8: Yeah.

532
00:50:49.450 --> 00:50:51.843
Hieu: I gotcha, and then

533
00:50:52.500 --> 00:51:05.839
Hieu: in a scenario where you're changing marital status. For for instance, you're married when you fill this out the 1st time, and then, for whatever reason, either divorce or widow, and you

534
00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:10.240
Hieu: change your answer from married to, let's say divorce.

535
00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:19.310
Hieu: And then you get this message. Can you basically explain to me what this message means to you?

536
00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:29.602
P8: So that means if you press, yes, and you have to input input the information like, Okay, when did your spouse pass away? Or when was the divorce completed?

537
00:51:30.110 --> 00:51:36.070
P8: that way? They can make their changes when it comes to the dependent and spousal stuff.

538
00:51:36.770 --> 00:51:39.630
Hieu: Okay. So you expect that when you select.

539
00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:43.890
Hieu: yes, there is. Gonna be some additional questions coming along.

540
00:51:43.890 --> 00:51:44.620
P8: Yes.

541
00:51:44.790 --> 00:51:45.880
Hieu: I gotcha.

542
00:51:46.210 --> 00:51:51.570
Hieu: Yeah, thank you for that. And then finally, here, that

543
00:51:51.690 --> 00:51:58.449
Hieu: financial information with one with the blank slate and one with the gray box reference.

544
00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:10.489
P8: So, looking at next to each other, I definitely like the blank slate, blank slate one, because it's like you could put in. You can focus your mind only on the 2024.

545
00:52:10.490 --> 00:52:11.000
Hieu: Gotcha.

546
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:12.939
P8: Just having the 2023.

547
00:52:13.420 --> 00:52:14.550
Hieu: I gotcha.

548
00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:19.773
Hieu: I want to say that is it?

549
00:52:20.997 --> 00:52:24.740
Hieu: for the prototype in the meantime, I

550
00:52:24.890 --> 00:52:30.849
Hieu: want to see if my colleagues have any questions for you, but otherwise, do you have any questions for me?

551
00:52:31.110 --> 00:52:33.226
P8: Oh, no! This was nice!

552
00:52:33.650 --> 00:52:44.019
Hieu: Okay, yeah, thank you for that. So I like to circle back and reconfirm that you are comfortable. If we decide to share a video clip of the session with our Va. Partners.

553
00:52:44.190 --> 00:52:44.880
P8: Yes.

554
00:52:45.430 --> 00:53:04.999
Hieu: Okay? So that kind of concludes our, you know, prototype interview here today. I just want to say that we really appreciate you taking your time out to share your feedback and thoughts with us. Your feedback will be very helpful as we continue to make the site better for all veterans.

555
00:53:05.380 --> 00:53:17.169
Hieu: And then, lastly, Prigian will send you a thank you. Note with a little blurb, that you can pass along to other veterans, that you may know who may be interested in participating in future researches.

556
00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:18.680
P8: Okay, perfect.

557
00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:21.459
Hieu: All right, thank you, and have a nice day.

558
00:53:21.460 --> 00:53:23.139
P8: You, too, have a great weekend.

559
00:53:23.140 --> 00:53:23.980
Hieu: Enjoy.

560
00:53:24.190 --> 00:53:25.379
P8: You too, bye.
