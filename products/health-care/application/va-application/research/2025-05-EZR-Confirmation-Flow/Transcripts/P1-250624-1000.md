23
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:59.340
Hieu: imagine that you have one spouse and one dependent for this scenario you may have to fill out, or you may have filled out a similar form before, and now they're asking you to update your financial information in this scenario. You've logged into your va.gov account where the system will pre fill some of the information for you for this scenario.

107
00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:39.879
Hieu: I see, so you don't have one to go back to.

108
00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:40.859
P1: Oh.

109
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.110
P1: I I mean I have an X on the top, but that would that would remove me, I believe.

110
00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:50.490
Hieu: Right. And then what about the top? Do you, Bobo?

111
00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:57.499
Hieu: This is no, the top, the very top of your phone screen. Is there a zoom button?

112
00:09:00.318 --> 00:09:06.041
P1: No, there's not. There's there's a notification. Icon. There's an X, and there's a

00:09:07.918 --> 00:09:10.360
P1: it says new chat, and

114
00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:18.200
P1: That's about it. New messages.

115
00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:22.469
P1: There's nothing here that suggests I'm in

116
00:09:24.069 --> 00:09:29.909
P1: zoom chat with you. This is all code, sir. I don't know what to do with it.

117
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:40.319
Hieu: Okay, it. It just sounds like you're stuck in a that chat screen. And I I want you to get back to like the video screen essentially. And I'm trying to see

118
00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:46.090
Hieu: what is a good way to navigate you back without actually seeing your screen.

119
00:09:47.796 --> 00:09:52.220
Hieu: Would you be able to quit, and then come back to this. This call.

120
00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:58.279
P1: You know what I just did. I clicked on the X in the upper left. I see you now, and I see the web page that.

121
00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.600
Hieu: Okay. Okay. Great.

122
00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:00.449
P1: Sorry about that.

123
00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:04.799
Hieu: No, not a problem, no worries. The technology can be confusing.

124
00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:10.270
P1: So we had this web BA web page about interacting with the prototype.

125
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:18.690
Hieu: Yes, that's that's correct, all right. So we're back on So

126
00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:29.659
Hieu: now I'm sharing this option with you, and then we'll we'll talk with this together as if, like, you're going through this, and then I want you to talk out loud as you're going through this.

127
00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:30.130
P1: So.

128
00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:35.530
Hieu: For the prototype. Here we will go with option green. And then.

129
00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:49.069
Hieu: as I said, please take a few moments to go through the page, and then I like you to think out loud as as much as possible, noting anything confusing, so I will go into option green.

130
00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.579
Hieu: and then I'll slowly scroll down for you.

131
00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:01.030
P1: Well, this looks like a A, you know, a familiar Va web page that I've been

132
00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:06.910
P1: accessing for years now updated, started getting updated a couple of years ago.

133
00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:13.290
Hieu: Okay? And then for this scenario, I just want to note that you'll be playing as Riley Smith.

134
00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:18.619
Hieu: So this would be, you know, a page that you would be seeing as Riley Smith.

135
00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:19.620
P1: Okay.

136
00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:24.829
Hieu: So this is very familiar to you.

137
00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:28.529
P1: Yeah, the color from the color to the font. Everything is familiar.

138
00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:45.339
Hieu: Okay? And then for this scenario like I mentioned, you're just here to update your financial information. So you clicked into this. And then this is the 1st thing you see, you want to confirm your information and then continue with the

139
00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:48.559
Hieu: of the flow, as once you're comfortable. With that.

140
00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:51.619
P1: Okay. So I would click on, continue. Then, right?

141
00:11:52.065 --> 00:11:52.510
Hieu: Yep!

142
00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:02.380
P1: okay, do I have the ability to scroll, or is? Do I leave that to you?

143
00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:09.460
P1: That so because I'm screen sharing, I will be scrolling. But then, please let me know if you want me to scroll up or down.

144
00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:13.954
P1: No, that's fine. This looks, you know. This looks familiar.

145
00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:15.480
Hieu: Okay.

146
00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:18.059
P1: I've updated my address a couple times.

147
00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:22.560
P1: This all looks pretty basic.

148
00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:23.680
Hieu: Okay.

149
00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:39.790
P1: Including including the little option at the bottom, which is nice little. It's a nice little. Add on about saving the request, because sometimes we have to take too long. I do or or I, I gotta take a phone call or something. So saving this information is a plus.

150
00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:42.090
Hieu: That's that's good to hear.

151
00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:46.799
Hieu: And then so with this, would you continue.

152
00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:47.780
P1: Sure.

153
00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:49.719
Hieu: Okay. And then I just want to note in.

154
00:12:50.178 --> 00:12:57.510
P1: Yeah. Well, I'm gonna suggest it's it's it's no since we're doing some homework here.

155
00:12:57.510 --> 00:12:58.085
Hieu: Right.

156
00:12:58.910 --> 00:12:59.910
P1: Alright!

157
00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:02.220
Hieu: All right. I'll continue.

158
00:13:06.146 --> 00:13:09.400
P1: Excuse me alright

159
00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:18.580
P1: and click on, continue, I guess.

160
00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:19.470
Hieu: Okay.

161
00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:29.689
P1: Yeah, this is, Riley doesn't have anything to change. I don't think.

162
00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:33.380
Hieu: Okay, that's you know, that's always good.

163
00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:37.510
Hieu: And then do you want to continue.

164
00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:38.639
P1: Continue, yeah.

165
00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:41.999
Hieu: So very, very kind of quick and effortless for you so far.

166
00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:47.939
P1: Yeah, it's just it looks. It looks. It looks familiar.

167
00:13:53.370 --> 00:14:04.849
P1: so I mean, do you want me to change these things? If if they don't. If they're not pertinent or they're not, they're not. For example, the marital says, Do you want me to actually get into that? And I mean

168
00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:11.060
P1: so for or we're just. We're just going through the page for general feedback.

169
00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:20.940
Hieu: So for this scenario we are just going through for general feedback, and then, as if you're in it, and then, for the most part, none of your information has changed.

170
00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:21.330
P1: Okay.

171
00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:26.659
Hieu: Our scenario. We're only updating our financial information. But you're going through this.

172
00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:28.620
P1: Alright!

173
00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:30.420
Hieu: Alright!

174
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.030
P1: Alright!

175
00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:39.209
Hieu: I'm sorry. Let me take a step back here.

176
00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:48.859
Hieu: So for the marital status page here, if you're no longer married, what do you expect to happen when you choose one of the other status.

177
00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:56.500
P1: What do I expect to happen? I would I should receive an options to to update that.

178
00:14:57.210 --> 00:14:57.570
Hieu: And then.

179
00:14:57.570 --> 00:14:59.970
P1: And what type? Up or down, arrow.

180
00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:04.359
Hieu: Okay? And then what do you expect in within those options?

181
00:15:04.853 --> 00:15:08.800
P1: Probably single divorced. Never married. Something like that.

182
00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:16.070
Hieu: I see. And then what do you expect to happen with your information in when you click around those other options?

183
00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:23.690
P1: Well, that would be saved. That would be saved by the Va. And I would click on, continue.

184
00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:26.470
Hieu: Okay, thank you for that.

185
00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:33.709
Hieu: I'll continue. And then in this scenario you are married to Jordan Smith.

186
00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:34.815
P1: Okay.

187
00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:55.840
P1: Alright!

188
00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:58.230
Hieu: Right, continue.

189
00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:18.180
P1: Well, I I'll tell you, Hugh, I mean I haven't been married in forever, so I I don't know. I don't know what I would do with that.

190
00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:21.100
Hieu: Okay. So technically, you wouldn't see these screens at all.

191
00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:22.529
P1: No, I wouldn't sue them.

192
00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:27.400
Hieu: Right then that I mean in general, I think your process would be a lot quicker.

193
00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:31.069
Hieu: because you wouldn't see this but for this scenario. You are.

194
00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:32.130
P1: I'll.

195
00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:41.280
Hieu: And then I mean, it seems like everything is very straightforward to you that you have seen this, and they're all very familiar.

196
00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:43.010
P1: Yeah, right now it is.

197
00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:44.060
Hieu: Okay.

198
00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:45.140
Hieu: Great.

199
00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:48.170
Hieu: If you were to do this.

200
00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:57.999
Hieu: you know, for real. And let's say you had a spouse, would you go through this relatively quickly, especially if the information is pre-filled like this.

201
00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:01.359
P1: Oh, yeah, yeah, relatively quickly.

202
00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:02.739
P1: It wouldn't take long.

203
00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:21.109
P1: Okay. Seems I have a son barely.

204
00:17:22.349 --> 00:17:28.929
Hieu: And then would you click to continue on? Or would you actually go in there and edit just to view the information.

205
00:17:29.321 --> 00:17:39.109
P1: For the sake of this exercise I would just leave it, as is. Well, yeah, Ryrie Smith, Michael Smith, I would leave it, as is.

206
00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:40.000
Hieu: Okay.

207
00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:40.750
P1: Yeah.

208
00:17:41.770 --> 00:18:08.719
Hieu: And then we move on to your incomes section here. So generally, I would actually give you like a financial information that you need. But I think in our case we'll keep it simple. And now we just talk out loud with this information. For this scenario. You and your spouse work and salary has not changed from 2023 to 2024. Think of it like an Irs thing, and then

209
00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:21.780
Hieu: so, and then in this scenario I would provide you provide you with your income information, but I think in our for our case I won't, because the text might be too busy for you.

210
00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:22.949
P1: All right.

211
00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:32.719
Hieu: But and then, if we're working through this prototype as if you have last year's information ready to go, and you're filling this out.

212
00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:38.650
P1: Yeah, actually actually here, what? I what I would I wouldn't have to fill any of this out, because

213
00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:43.060
P1: I don't pay any tax. There's no taxable income.

214
00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:52.339
P1: you know, so I would. I would just either leave these blank, or if it didn't accept the blank I would. I would put a 0 period 0 0, there.

215
00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:56.670
Hieu: I see right? So for your case. In reality, you just put 0.

216
00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:57.730
P1: Right.

217
00:18:58.488 --> 00:19:04.590
Hieu: In this scenario. You are, you know, like working. So you do have some income here.

218
00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:05.590
P1: Alright!

219
00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:11.339
Hieu: But in your case, in reality you put 0.

220
00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:17.480
Hieu: Then do you want it to continue.

221
00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:18.370
P1: Sure.

222
00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:24.210
Hieu: All right, and this is your spouse information. Here again.

223
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:29.490
Hieu: if you know, have spouse and they're working, then they'll have income as well.

224
00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:33.740
Hieu: So pretty straightforward for you, so far.

225
00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:46.208
P1: For me. Yeah, I know that some other many veterans have had problems getting this account even started. But once they get in there, and I've talked to several

226
00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:54.070
P1: once they once they create the account, which seems to be the the sticking point for many not not accessing. va.gov

227
00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:59.773
P1: once once they get in here. It's this. This part of it is is

228
00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:25.970
P1: to me. For me it's it's it's quite easy. I I in fact, I really enjoy the option, you know, in the past, and this goes way back. We had to call or leave a voicemail or punch in our prescription numbers on the phone. It was a mess. So this va.gov is health net was great. va.gov is is really good.

229
00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:29.490
Hieu: That is actually good to hear. Thank you for your input there.

230
00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:31.260
P1: You're welcome.

231
00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:41.779
Hieu: So I just wanna say it's it's good to, you know. Hear someone that's using this and then enjoy it and thinks it's easy, so that's always appreciative.

232
00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:45.220
Hieu: So we'll move on to the next portion.

233
00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:54.870
Hieu: And then this is the deductible again. Generally it's unchanged for the most part, so

234
00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:59.999
Hieu: you'll have deductibles that you can put in, or expenses that you can put here.

235
00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:09.530
Hieu: And then, if you're doing this for real, I assume that it'd be a lot slower because you want to read through everything.

236
00:21:11.681 --> 00:21:18.990
P1: I don't know if it would be a lot slower. I would I would read through that. But but there's some sections for like example, this.

237
00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:29.819
P1: this this page where I wouldn't have I wouldn't spend a lot of time on. There's no need to for me. You know what I mean.

238
00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:30.720
Hieu: Yeah.

239
00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:38.819
Hieu: So let me take a pause there. Actually,

240
00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:44.039
Hieu: so was any part of this confusing for you.

241
00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:45.280
P1: No.

242
00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:46.430
Hieu: Okay. And then.

243
00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:47.030
P1: Honest.

244
00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:55.459
Hieu: And then on a scale of one to 5, 1 being very easy, and then 5 being very hard. How difficult was it for you to complete this financial.

245
00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:57.560
P1: This should be a 1.

246
00:21:57.820 --> 00:21:59.880
Hieu: One. Okay. Very easy.

247
00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:00.750
P1: Yeah.

248
00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:08.270
Hieu: And then do you have any suggestion or a feedback for making the page and update process easier.

249
00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:16.070
P1: Excuse me, I'm always conf concerned about the font. Obviously, we're on a phone now, and the font is a lot smaller. But

250
00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:28.359
P1: and I can't remember if we have the option@ba.gov to increase the font on our own. I know that it's it's it's pretty good size for me now. But

251
00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:44.550
P1: it's it's not gonna be. Hope. I'm hoping that in the future, and maybe you have that now I just can't remember. But the option to increase the font as we as we access any page@va.gov would be

252
00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:50.337
P1: be be necessary for me other than that. There's

253
00:22:52.100 --> 00:23:03.329
P1: gosh! There's not. I don't have a whole lot to. I don't have anything negative to talk about right now. There's occasions where it won't load, but that's every web page and

254
00:23:04.735 --> 00:23:08.929
P1: the options are are from the main page, or

255
00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:13.970
P1: are, you know, from prescriptions to appointments to

256
00:23:14.842 --> 00:23:19.459
P1: medical records. Everything is laid out quite nicely, so

257
00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:25.189
P1: I don't have any. I don't have any downside to to relate to you right now.

258
00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:34.090
Hieu: That's good, that's good to hear. And I and then but then your one thing you want is basically a font size control.

259
00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:56.340
P1: Right, and the colors I would leave alone. I mean, I this is very. It's clear it's crisp. It's easy for me to see. And I don't remember if it has even been if color the font color has even been changed from health healthy back, because I haven't gone there in a while, but I believe it was something like this.

260
00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:58.750
Hieu: This is, yeah, okay?

261
00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:04.469
Hieu: And then you came from a health. Is it my healthy vet.

262
00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:08.150
P1: I migrated the account to go. Yeah.

263
00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:11.779
Hieu: And then it has been an easy immigration process for you.

264
00:24:12.484 --> 00:24:25.455
P1: Yeah, I I remember when I created the account I mean, I got it done that night. But it did take a while, because it was new. Everything new we have to get used to, you know, but

265
00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:32.870
P1: I believe I had to take a screenshot of the of my driver's license or something, and

266
00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:43.203
P1: again, I'm not sure that everybody would be either willing or or understanding of what that's why that's required.

267
00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:58.880
P1: I don't remember the application process, or I should say the online process to create an account would be Gov. I do remember login.gov and id.gov, and there are too many of those, and I I see that you're pairing those down. Excuse me.

268
00:24:59.950 --> 00:25:03.820
P1: excuse me so. So that's a good thing.

269
00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:12.390
P1: for me. It's for me. This has been an easy experience to to migrate from from healthy bed.

270
00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:16.819
Hieu: Okay, that is actually very great to hear. Thank you for that. Input.

271
00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:20.270
Hieu: We'll move along here and.

272
00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:20.630
P1: Bye.

273
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:23.130
Hieu: Let's say you know you add 0 there

274
00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:31.390
Hieu: and then you move to this page, and then this is, I want to say.

275
00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:35.049
Hieu: one of your last page here, and then in this page, what would you do.

276
00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:41.519
P1: I probably click on the plus sign. Make sure that that was correct. Everything was correct. There.

277
00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:44.240
Hieu: Yeah, do a quick review here.

278
00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:45.110
P1: Right.

279
00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:53.740
Hieu: And then in this scenario.

280
00:25:54.830 --> 00:26:06.640
Hieu: You realize that one of your expenses incorrect? You had a big out of pocket kind of dental operation last year of $3,000. How would you fix that error?

281
00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:09.930
P1: Where is that shown? Or or.

282
00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:14.120
Hieu: This is your reimbursable medical expense here.

283
00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:20.350
P1: Okay. And well, I mean, if that needs to be changed, I'd click on edit.

284
00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:23.479
Hieu: Okay, so very straightforward for you. Again.

285
00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:25.330
P1: Yeah.

286
00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:40.599
Hieu: And then on a difficulty of one to 5, you know, just going through this process like trying to edit one being very easy and 5 being very hard, how would you rate this whole form that you just went through.

287
00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:43.197
P1: That that would be a 1.

288
00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:53.360
Hieu: And then on an efficiency scale of one to 5, 1 being very efficient and 5 being very inefficient, how would you rate the whole form you just went through.

289
00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:54.360
P1: I've won.

290
00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:56.810
Hieu: Oh, one. Okay. So both

291
00:26:57.530 --> 00:27:01.420
Hieu: both are pretty good to go with in your in your eyes.

292
00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:03.020
P1: Yeah, for me. They were doing.

293
00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:10.970
Hieu: Okay? And then. Now we'll end the green option of the the demo here, and then we'll move on to the red option. Is that. Okay.

294
00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:12.300
Hieu: okay with you. Sure.

295
00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:19.129
Hieu: Alright. So that was the green. We just completed the green option. Now we'll move on to the red option here

296
00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:32.669
Hieu: and then in this option, you'll basically see a lot of the same same things. It's just this is a slightly different flow. And essentially, we want to hear your inputs on this as well.

297
00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:41.540
Hieu: And then again, speak out loud, or just go, you know.

298
00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:45.140
Hieu: You share your thoughts as you were going through this.

299
00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:51.989
P1: Yeah, I don't. I don't see anything different, really, right now.

300
00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:55.030
Hieu: Okay, so continue.

301
00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:07.040
P1: I don't know about the the mailing address and the home address. Mine are always the same, but

302
00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:11.929
P1: that for others, perhaps they would be different. I don't know.

303
00:28:12.530 --> 00:28:18.140
Hieu: And then if you have different address would this be helpful for you?

304
00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:30.629
P1: No, I'm I'm I'm saying that if they, if they show different mailing addresses and home addresses, might be beneficial to go into edit.

305
00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:34.419
P1: Take care of that. But I've never had that problem.

306
00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:35.480
Hieu: Right.

307
00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:36.873
Hieu: And then

308
00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:47.789
Hieu: for this option, do you prefer looking at this option, this overview option? Or do you prefer the detail option that was displayed earlier.

309
00:28:57.150 --> 00:29:07.849
P1: Well, I I don't. I I don't know. They both look pretty much the same to me. I mean, simplicity would be the key, you know. I don't remember frankly

310
00:29:10.390 --> 00:29:12.810
P1: about the last option.

311
00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:13.589
Hieu: Okay, that's.

312
00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:15.899
P1: In comparison to this one. They I mean.

313
00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:22.210
P1: I'm sorry I was about ready to scroll there. I didn't mean to do that.

314
00:29:25.090 --> 00:29:33.310
P1: This is pretty. This is pretty straightforward. Here, you know, phone email, mailing address, home address.

315
00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:37.000
P1: That's all the Va needs. I guess.

316
00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:40.569
Hieu: Okay, so, but you don't really have an opinion on.

317
00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:43.539
P1: No, I guess I don't. I guess I don't.

318
00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:48.730
Hieu: Not an issue there and then.

319
00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:52.400
P1: Either one is, either one would have been fine with me. Frankly.

320
00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:53.890
Hieu: Gotcha.

321
00:29:54.510 --> 00:29:56.069
Hieu: Then I'll move on. Then.

322
00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:02.360
P1: Okay.

323
00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:10.179
P1: that would be an easy edit. Obviously, if if need be.

324
00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:13.919
Hieu: Then I'll continue.

325
00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:20.910
P1: Okay.

326
00:30:22.308 --> 00:30:29.639
Hieu: So for your sake, would you again go in and add it, or you just continue, because this is enough for you.

327
00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:33.639
P1: If Riley was divorced I'd make sure that that

328
00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:38.590
P1: showed that. I will tell you, however, that

329
00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:45.146
P1: you get into a little gray area. This has nothing to do with the with the

330
00:30:46.920 --> 00:31:03.069
P1: Why we got together today. But I asked the Va. About this as well. I've been divorced for so long that I have to continue to put divorce in there. And they said, you can put single ones. So I think frankly, if you've been divorced for 40 years or longer.

331
00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:14.000
P1: Who cares? I don't think the Va. Cares what I put in, divorced or or single. It's just just my little one of my little quirks, you know.

332
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.749
Hieu: I gotcha. So you want it like, after a certain amount of time that.

333
00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:23.229
P1: Yeah, those were married or divorced. There are some. There are some other options, you know.

334
00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:25.710
Hieu: Yeah, that was fair.

335
00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:29.060
P1: Okay, Hugh, I've got to take a quick pill.

336
00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:31.920
Hieu: Sure thing, we'll pause here as you do that.

337
00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:32.770
P1: Okay.

338
00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:41.820
P1: Alright, I'm sorry about that.

339
00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:45.380
Hieu: No worries. Welcome back, and then we'll continue here.

340
00:31:52.570 --> 00:31:53.600
P1: Okay.

341
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:10.479
P1: Alright, let's yeah, I I would I would be zipping through this. Really, this is not. This is not

342
00:32:10.650 --> 00:32:14.340
P1: rocket science. Roy. Yeah, it's way too easy.

343
00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:15.209
Hieu: See for you.

344
00:32:15.670 --> 00:32:16.789
P1: I'm sorry, Ron.

345
00:32:16.790 --> 00:32:19.170
Hieu: This seems like it's very easy for you.

346
00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:21.380
P1: Oh, yeah, yeah, it is.

347
00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:46.279
Hieu: All right. We'll go here. And then, just like previously, you have the financial information, and then you're going through the exact same scenario where you and your spouse's work and salary has not changed from 2,013 to 2,024. And then you are just filling out this information here.

348
00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:52.020
Hieu: and I'll slowly scroll and then see if you have anything that you want to say.

349
00:32:55.930 --> 00:33:07.299
P1: Yeah, see, this is all. This is, this is where I I would have an issue, a problem, because I I just don't fill out tax forms, so I don't know what's right or wrong. Here.

350
00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:08.060
Hieu: Okay.

351
00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:08.440
P1: And it.

352
00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:08.850
Hieu: To know.

353
00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:11.309
P1: Yeah, I I mean.

354
00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:17.980
P1: I I don't know what I would do with this. I'd probably I don't think this would be on

355
00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:29.520
P1: it would either not be on the form that I would fill out, because the Va. Has that information, or there, there would be an option here somewhere where I could just

356
00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:34.229
P1: put in, not not applicable, or something to that effect.

357
00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:41.869
Hieu: Right. So because you expect in your situation none of this s applicable to you, and you might not even see this.

358
00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:44.029
P1: Right, right.

359
00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:46.440
Hieu: That's actually a very fair assessment.

360
00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:56.740
Hieu: In that case we'll quickly go through this. Then

361
00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:05.419
Hieu: again, you'll see kind of the screens here again.

362
00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:07.849
Hieu: Same information as last time.

363
00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:11.649
Hieu: No issues for you.

364
00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:21.279
P1: No, no! And both forms either. One whatever you you all choose, I think, would be fine with me.

365
00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:22.120
Hieu: Okay?

366
00:34:23.139 --> 00:34:26.790
Hieu: And then when you

367
00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:32.730
Hieu: I'm gonna stop you right here. And then I am curious. If

368
00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:38.680
Hieu: what was your thought from this financial information form versus the last one.

369
00:34:39.130 --> 00:34:40.790
Hieu: Was there any difference for you.

370
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:52.650
P1: Well, I mean there's a little difference in the formatting. But for me, I mean there would. No, I mean whatever I was shown I'd I'd work with, so they're both. They both look super easy to go through.

371
00:34:52.850 --> 00:34:53.790
Hieu: Gotcha.

372
00:34:53.949 --> 00:34:57.769
Hieu: And then in this form it actually has like

373
00:34:57.910 --> 00:35:05.090
Hieu: information from your 2023 information versus your 2024 information.

374
00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:09.000
Hieu: Would you think that would be helpful if you were filling this out for real.

375
00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:18.599
P1: It would be for probably younger veterans, but not for myself. This wouldn't be. This wouldn't be pertinent to me.

376
00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:23.130
Hieu: Right. So in this case, both very straightforward.

377
00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:23.950
P1: Yeah.

378
00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:26.040
Hieu: Okay, I gotcha.

379
00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:28.220
Hieu: And then

380
00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:37.618
Hieu: if you had to rate this versus the previous one, you know the one to 5 scale with one being very easy, and 5 being very difficult.

381
00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:40.370
Hieu: would you also read this as a 1? Then.

382
00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:42.629
P1: Yeah, this would be. This would be a 1 as well.

383
00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:45.969
Hieu: Okay, thank you for that.

384
00:35:45.970 --> 00:35:46.670
P1: Okay.

385
00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:49.669
Hieu: And then we'll move on here.

386
00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:07.009
P1: Yeah, again, this would be none of this would be pertinence. My.

387
00:36:09.590 --> 00:36:12.526
Hieu: My, yeah, I mean,

388
00:36:15.113 --> 00:36:23.160
P1: You know. No, no taxes, no, no deductibles the annual income is the Va. Knows that.

389
00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:23.850
Hieu: Right.

390
00:36:23.850 --> 00:36:25.210
P1: No spouse.

391
00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:28.733
Hieu: And then

392
00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:44.570
Hieu: for this scenario, you know. From the last scenario there was an error in the medical expense. If it was the same kind of error here. Would it be easy for you to catch if it's in this format versus the last? Or, again.

393
00:36:44.570 --> 00:36:47.479
Hieu: it's kind of indifferent. You can click on. Edit.

394
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:48.150
Hieu: Okay?

395
00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:49.110
P1: Like chat.

396
00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:50.120
Hieu: Yeah.

397
00:36:53.160 --> 00:37:02.839
P1: But you know, I again, as a as a hundred percent service connected. Vet, I wouldn't get this, anyway, because there are no

398
00:37:03.810 --> 00:37:21.840
P1: my my health care any expenses. Medical expenses are paid for by the Va. Thank goodness, they are including prescriptions, so I don't believe this would show up if it did, I would I would either click on edit. I could also, perhaps.

399
00:37:22.689 --> 00:37:32.480
P1: send a message. I very rarely call the Va. Anymore, because this is the quickest option. Frankly.

400
00:37:32.830 --> 00:37:33.370
Hieu: And then

401
00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:34.850
P1: Sorry.

402
00:37:34.850 --> 00:37:35.530
Hieu: Can you go ahead?

403
00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:38.059
P1: No, that's all I was going to say. I mean.

404
00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:38.620
Hieu: Okay.

405
00:37:39.014 --> 00:37:52.805
P1: Yeah, I'm a pretty generic. I'm a rather generic veteran here. I don't. I don't have all these other issues. Thank goodness to deal with like deductibles and a spouse's income and whatnot.

406
00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:58.310
Hieu: Gotcha, and then the messaging has been very helpful for you. Then it's been great. Yeah, okay.

407
00:37:58.310 --> 00:37:59.039
Hieu: that's good to hear.

408
00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:07.600
P1: I use that the most. By the way, I mean the nurse and myself back and forth yesterday. Probably

409
00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:18.540
P1: I don't know 4 or 5 different messages. It was of a rather serious nature. So when I send that I know I'm going to get a response

410
00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:35.659
P1: quickly. So I mean going this this route, as opposed to, you know, picking up the phone, dialing the number, trying to figure out the extension or maybe get a live person they want you. They want your social security number phone number address. You know what I'm talking about. So.

411
00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:36.220
Hieu: Right.

412
00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:41.000
P1: This is so much easier. And thank goodness for technology.

413
00:38:41.313 --> 00:38:45.079
Hieu: You know, always good to hear that it's working out for you.

414
00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:46.429
P1: Thank you.

415
00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:53.060
Hieu: Okay. So I think with this, I want to say that we can end the demo portion today, and then.

416
00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:53.380
P1: Bye.

417
00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:57.020
Hieu: I do have a couple of last questions to ask.

418
00:38:57.020 --> 00:38:57.540
P1: All right.

419
00:38:57.540 --> 00:39:03.439
Hieu: What do we before we end everything here? So let me pull out another screen.

420
00:39:03.730 --> 00:39:07.549
Hieu: Give me a few seconds while I do that.

421
00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:11.539
Hieu: How's your day been so far.

422
00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:14.030
P1: It's okay. It's awful hot.

423
00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:16.369
P1: It's an awful lot. Wow!

424
00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:20.370
Hieu: I'm sorry. Did you say it's awful lot.

425
00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:21.870
P1: No, it's hot.

426
00:39:21.870 --> 00:39:22.890
Hieu: Oh, it's hot! Where?

427
00:39:22.890 --> 00:39:28.270
P1: Are you located? I'm in upstate New York, and you know we never have a springtime. Here.

428
00:39:28.430 --> 00:39:31.380
P1: We we go from wintertime to this stuff.

429
00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:32.400
P1: I gotcha.

430
00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:36.630
P1: I'm not a fan of of 104 degree temperatures.

431
00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:38.420
Hieu: Oh! Oh! That is hot!

432
00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:39.285
P1: Yeah.

433
00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:41.490
Hieu: Yeah.

434
00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:43.540
P1: Oh!

435
00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:47.800
Hieu: Okay, let me.

436
00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:50.169
Hieu: This might be a little bit hard.

437
00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:50.809
P1: Yeah, it is.

438
00:39:50.810 --> 00:39:51.270
Hieu: See here!

439
00:39:51.270 --> 00:39:53.330
P1: Yeah, it is. I was gonna mention that.

440
00:39:53.330 --> 00:39:54.950
Hieu: Yeah, let me get rid of it.

441
00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:59.370
P1: I don't know if I can make that larger on my side, or.

442
00:39:59.578 --> 00:40:00.620
Hieu: I'll make it larger on.

443
00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:01.710
Hieu: All right.

444
00:40:07.410 --> 00:40:11.430
Hieu: Let me see if I can make this smaller here.

445
00:40:12.030 --> 00:40:15.840
Hieu: So we have. If you can make out 3 different options here.

446
00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:21.350
P1: I I can. I see the options, but I gotta tell you I can't see the text. Oh, there we go!

447
00:40:21.350 --> 00:40:22.130
Hieu: Okay.

448
00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:22.880
P1: Okay.

449
00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:30.220
Hieu: So we have option, a option B, and then option C, do have a preference for any of the options that

450
00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:32.670
Hieu: you mean the formatting.

451
00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:33.950
Hieu: Yeah, the formatting.

452
00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:39.309
P1: Let's go through them again. Go ahead and scroll down.

453
00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:40.530
Hieu: Option, a.

454
00:40:41.450 --> 00:40:44.449
Hieu: Option B and option C.

455
00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:45.580
Hieu: This is displaying.

456
00:40:45.897 --> 00:40:46.850
Hieu: I'll tell you.

457
00:40:47.551 --> 00:41:02.329
P1: Well, the second one, I think, has the border. The border would be better around that information. I'd prefer the border there for my name, social security, number, date of birth. Other than that. I can't think of anything else that

458
00:41:03.222 --> 00:41:08.360
P1: that stood out as needed to be changed, you know. But I I want that

459
00:41:09.474 --> 00:41:17.819
P1: I want that border even a even a boulder a border would be better, I think, for me.

460
00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:23.209
Hieu: Okay. So basically, this stands out enough for you to kind of call your attention to it. And

461
00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:29.680
Hieu: right right, Gotcha, that's that's all I need to to hear.

462
00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:35.270
Hieu: and then for the next one is kind of the marital status. Here we have 2 different

463
00:41:35.854 --> 00:41:37.109
Hieu: kind of menu type.

464
00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:46.550
P1: Yeah, I've got 2, because there's no need to click on the up or down arrows. It's it's all laid out there. I would go with the second one.

465
00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:49.572
Hieu: Gotcha, just because you want all the

466
00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:52.500
P1: It's easier. Yeah, yeah, it's quicker.

467
00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:55.320
Hieu: Yeah, that sounds great.

468
00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:00.850
Hieu: And then finally.

469
00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:11.650
Hieu: so let's say, in in your case. Here, let's say you're married, and then you switch to either, you know, divorce, widow, or whatnot.

470
00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:21.639
Hieu: And then you see this prompt screen here, changing your marital status. Can you go through what would be in your mind if you see this message.

471
00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:28.999
P1: I don't think I would, really, but I mean, if I did, I would click on. Yes, change if there was an issue.

472
00:42:29.586 --> 00:42:36.010
P1: No doubt the Va. Would let me know about it. But if they require documentation or something.

473
00:42:37.077 --> 00:42:41.950
P1: Yeah. And and frankly, Hugh, I I don't remember.

474
00:42:44.910 --> 00:42:52.229
P1: I've been divorced so long that none of this existed, anyway, and I don't believe the Va. Ever asked me

475
00:42:52.420 --> 00:43:06.629
P1: on any form if my marital status had changed. It's always been, either. It's always been divorced. But there was a time when I was initially visiting the Va. Where I was married.

476
00:43:07.205 --> 00:43:10.270
P1: There just weren't any forms is my point. You know what I mean.

477
00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:11.160
Hieu: Right, right.

478
00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:21.329
P1: Technology. So I would right now I would click on. Yes, change. And if it went through fine, and if it didn't, BA is pretty good about letting us know that we

479
00:43:21.770 --> 00:43:23.410
P1: we gotta make some changes.

480
00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:26.979
Hieu: Okay, you know it's always good to hear that your experience has been.

481
00:43:27.476 --> 00:43:29.259
Hieu: You know, going very well.

482
00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:38.509
Hieu: And I think I do have this last screen here, which is the 2 different types of showing the income information.

483
00:43:38.810 --> 00:43:41.720
Hieu: Do you have a preference for one or the other.

484
00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:43.210
P1: Can you make it larger?

485
00:43:43.210 --> 00:43:45.459
Hieu: Yes, so the 1st one is here.

486
00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:47.809
P1: Okay, that should grossing going on.

487
00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:54.349
Hieu: And then the second one essentially includes this reference. Gray box here.

488
00:43:54.350 --> 00:43:58.019
P1: Yeah, again, the second one. It was just everything, is there?

489
00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:02.560
P1: Let me see the 1st one again. Yeah. So you

490
00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:08.380
P1: number 2.

491
00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:09.860
Hieu: Number 2.

492
00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:13.020
P1: Yeah, I would. Just I would number 2 looks.

493
00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:19.040
P1: It looks laid out better to me, easier to work with.

494
00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:20.550
Hieu: Gotcha.

495
00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:26.120
Hieu: All right. Thank you for that. Let me see if I have anything else.

496
00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:30.829
Hieu: No, that is it. I can stop my screen share here.

497
00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:34.999
Hieu: I do have a few.

498
00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:37.709
Hieu: Let me see what else?

499
00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:45.730
Hieu: so you know. Thank you so much for going through the form with me. Do you have any questions for me.

500
00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:57.640
P1: No, not at all. No, I I just I will tell you. And and and the other 2 people I forgot their names that are are with us today, that

501
00:44:58.050 --> 00:45:08.850
P1: this has made a world of difference, not to. I can only speak for myself, but it's so easy to contact the Va. Now, and if I don't know if you remember

502
00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:11.579
P1: the Va. Had a ton of sites.

503
00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:37.524
P1: I mean, they were just jumbled all over the place, you know, and phone numbers and and contact addresses. And who who does that anymore? Who? Who writes a letter to the Va. And addresses it and gets a stamp, you know. So this I mean it. It just continues to get better and better, and simplicity is obviously the key for me. As I get older it's even more important. And

504
00:45:38.620 --> 00:45:48.180
P1: I love the way you guys have coded this I've been. I've been with you since we were given the option to change from healthy vet.

505
00:45:48.650 --> 00:45:50.100
P1: and it's been a breeze.

506
00:45:50.470 --> 00:46:09.289
Hieu: Okay, you know, always good to hear that your experience has been very positive and thank you for the feedback especially. You know, we appreciate any negative one, too. But obviously yours. Yours has been very positive, so always appreciative. And then I'll share that with the rest of the team as well.

507
00:46:09.290 --> 00:46:10.050
P1: Okay.

508
00:46:10.370 --> 00:46:19.929
Hieu: So I want to circle back and confirm that you are comfortable. If we do end up sharing a video clip of this session, you know, to our Va partners.

509
00:46:20.210 --> 00:46:21.769
P1: Yeah. So that'd be fine.

510
00:46:21.770 --> 00:46:28.709
Hieu: Okay? And then, just to remind you, we'll remove any information that would be used to identify you before sharing that information.

511
00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:30.120
P1: Okay.

512
00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:55.329
Hieu: And then, you know, I want to say, thank you again. I really appreciate taking your time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful for us to kind of continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for the veteran. And then, lastly, Pregn will be sending you a thank you note and a little blurb of how you can pass it along to other veterans that you may know to provide them

513
00:46:55.330 --> 00:47:02.220
Hieu: with a chance to participate in future research studies as well. So thank you again, and enjoy the rest of your day.

514
00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:04.650
P1: Okay. Thank you. Have a good day.

515
00:47:04.650 --> 00:47:06.329
Hieu: All right. Take care bye.
