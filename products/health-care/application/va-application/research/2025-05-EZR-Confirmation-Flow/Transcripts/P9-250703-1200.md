00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:11.230
Hieu: I have started recording. I like to confirm that you are comfortable. If I record my on screen my screen and audio as we talk today.

2
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:11.829
P9: Yes, that's right.

3
00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:24.429
Hieu: And then I like to confirm that you are comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our from our session today to share with our Va partners. If we remove any identifying information.

4
00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:25.559
P9: Sure. Yes.

5
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.329
Hieu: All right. Thank you for that. I'll jump right into the fun now.

6
00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.050
P9: Nice. Do you? Do you work for the Va. Or you're a contractor for the Va.

7
00:00:33.325 --> 00:00:34.980
Hieu: I'm a contractor for the Va.

8
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:35.920
P9: Okay. Okay.

9
00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.810
Hieu: Yeah.

10
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.680
Hieu: So do you have a service-connected disability rating at the Va.

11
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:43.570
P9: I do?

12
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.640
Hieu: All right, and then can I? What is your disability rating.

13
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.709
P9: 90%.

14
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:55.700
Hieu: 90%, all right. And when was the last time you or have you recently visited the va.gov website?

15
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.149
P9: Yes, just like yesterday.

16
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.299
Hieu: Oh, okay. And then what were you using it for?

17
00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:27.190
P9: Well, I use it for myself as a veteran. So like my health that or different programs. But I also work for the Va, so sometimes I need to go and try to help veterans find things for them that I I don't always know at all the benefits. But I like

18
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:41.449
P9: using the website because there's there's a lot there. But sometimes people need help. I'm a social worker. So sometimes they may be older and they don't go online as much. So I like to go to va.gov, there's so much stuff that

19
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:50.340
P9: all the different programs. And so so I like to use it personally and like for my job.

20
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.980
Hieu: I see. Wow! That is actually very cool. So you're very familiar with the system. Then.

21
00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:56.370
P9: Yeah.

22
00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.689
Hieu: And then did you use it? A phone tablet and or a desktop with it? Then.

23
00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:10.309
P9: Well, when I used it yesterday, it was on the computer. But when when it comes to me like for my stuff, I use it on my cell phone.

24
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.139
Hieu: I see. And would that be like the mobile version of the website? Or is it the app.

25
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.959
P9: Yes, yeah, I don't use the app. I just go on the desktop version.

26
00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
Hieu: I gotcha. Thank you for that.

27
00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:42.480
Hieu: All right. So today we'll be going through 2 different prototype. One is an option red and one's an option green. Imagine that you have a spouse and one dependent, and then you may have filled out a similar form before. And now they're asking you to kind of update your financial information

28
00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:52.199
Hieu: in this scenario. You logged into your ba.gov account where the system has pre-filled some some of your information for you.

29
00:02:53.781 --> 00:02:58.759
Hieu: In this scenario. Are you comfortable with sharing your screen and talk through your process.

30
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.840
P9: Yes.

31
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:08.440
Hieu: Okay, so I'll give you a link to our prototype through the chat here.

32
00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:09.760
P9: Okay.

33
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.400
Hieu: What I want you to do is click on it, and then.

34
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:19.820
Hieu: once that's loaded, please share your screen. In the in the meantime, please close any kind of personal information

35
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.600
Hieu: like Facebook, social media, or whatnot.

36
00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.860
Hieu: And then let me know if you need any help with that.

37
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.019
P9: Should it be like figma? Is that what should be loading.

38
00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.510
Hieu: Yes, yes.

39
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.612
P9: Okay. Oh, this is the 10 easy. Okay.

40
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.059
Hieu: Really with that.

41
00:03:39.603 --> 00:03:51.813
P9: Yeah, a lot of my veterans that are trying to access the services that we I do homeless veterans. They were always telling them to fill this out. But I I haven't filled it out in so long myself.

42
00:03:52.640 --> 00:04:00.209
P9: but they usually do the paper version. So this is good. Okay, so it's still taking a little bit to load.

43
00:04:01.161 --> 00:04:04.449
P9: Okay, here we go, and then to share.

44
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.710
P9: I haven't used.

45
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.270
Hieu: Zoom in that way.

46
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.539
P9: Well, this workplace. Zoom! I haven't used.

47
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:12.330
Hieu: I got it.

48
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.949
P9: Oh, here, here it is. I found it alright.

49
00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.149
P9: Okay. Is it working.

50
00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:27.339
Hieu: I says, oh, I do see it! And then can you make sure you can scroll that up and down on this?

51
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.100
Hieu: Alright perfect? It is working

52
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:44.829
Hieu: alright. So this is the demo or the prototype, if you will. We'll start with the option green. So if you scroll down there you'll see 2 options. One is green, one's red. We'll start with green.

53
00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:52.879
Hieu: Please take a few moments to go through this page. I'd like you to think out loud as much as possible, noting anything confusing.

54
00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.290
Hieu: I just want to know in this scenario you are Riley Smith.

55
00:05:11.534 --> 00:05:12.020
P9: Okay.

56
00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.739
P9: Okay, alright, that's fine. That makes sense. So hit continue.

57
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:23.409
Hieu: Okay, yeah. So no issues with with the screen. So far for you. Alright. Yeah. Continue.

58
00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:36.719
Hieu: As I mentioned before in this scenario, this information came from previous information. You provided for the research purposes. You would be going through this form to make sure the fill-in are accurate and make sense.

59
00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.249
P9: That's fine. That makes sense.

60
00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.099
Hieu: Okay, go ahead. Continue.

61
00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:02.889
P9: Oh, man, I have to hit it again. Okay.

62
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.990
P9: okay, yeah. That's pretty.

63
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:16.530
Hieu: So pretty straightforward for you.

64
00:06:32.349 --> 00:06:40.160
P9: I know on the one of the assessments I do. There's like an option of like

65
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:48.810
P9: like single or and then another one is like, you know.

66
00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:51.284
P9: because you might have people who are

67
00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:58.210
P9: like in a relationship. But they're not married. But they're.

68
00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:02.010
P9: you know, maybe like a domestic relationship.

69
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:07.100
Hieu: Okay. So you're thinking it's missing some status here.

70
00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:31.530
P9: Maybe just like one other option, or I think it's committed relationship or something it says like that. I I don't know. But the I have to do a a something called a homes assessment with veterans, and those are options. So they have a little bit more options than just married, not never married, you know, so I don't know. That might be something, because somebody might not fall into this. You know.

71
00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:34.549
Hieu: Right? Okay, that's good to know. Thank you for that.

72
00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:36.620
P9: Okay? Alright.

73
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:51.799
P9: So is this when it says spouses. Is that because in this scenario that was chosen, that I was married is that. Oh, that's right. You said I was married. Okay.

74
00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.270
Hieu: Yeah, you're Mary. And then you have filled out this information before.

75
00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:55.820
P9: Okay.

76
00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:57.160
Hieu: That's why it's pre-filling it.

77
00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:57.780
P9: Okay?

78
00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:14.840
P9: Oh, it's already there. Okay, alright.

79
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:39.529
P9: So do they. Only is the 10 easy, only wanting to know this financial information. If you're married to the person or just the household in general, because I have a lot of people that they could be with their partner 20 years. They're not legally married, but for va purposes are they only wanting spouse like? Is that

80
00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:41.924
P9: So

81
00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.780
Hieu: Happening in this case.

82
00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:53.890
Hieu: because they needed financial information one way or another, they'll ask for it through the household information.

83
00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:54.280
P9: Okay.

84
00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:55.520
Hieu: Section here.

85
00:08:55.690 --> 00:09:03.629
P9: Okay. But the the language spouse is that just because of our the scenario you set up for me, or or does it does. Everyone

86
00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:09.049
P9: is that the only language is spouse.

87
00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:19.480
Hieu: Yeah. So for this, because you have a spouse, this language pertains to the spouse. If you do not, then you get a different kind of pathway.

88
00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:22.340
P9: Yeah, I was just curious for those other people who might.

89
00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.961
P9: They might be in a committed relationship.

90
00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:30.830
Hieu: Doesn't accurately capture their situation. You're saying.

91
00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:33.398
P9: Right right. I just was curious. If it

92
00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:35.370
Hieu: Right.

93
00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:47.749
P9: Okay? So it says, house will save spouses, financial support, what we consider financial support. We consider any payments. And if they aren't regular.

94
00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:51.100
P9: okay.

95
00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:03.420
P9: okay, that's pretty straightforward.

96
00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:04.270
Hieu: Okay.

97
00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:24.590
P9: Interesting.

98
00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.019
P9: I didn't know that. Okay,

99
00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:30.730
Hieu: Yeah, what was what was interesting to you.

100
00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:33.309
P9: That a spouse is considered a dependent

101
00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:38.176
P9: in this way. Okay, I was just thinking in my brain.

102
00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:38.980
Hieu: Yeah.

103
00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:39.700
P9: No.

104
00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:49.420
P9: they're 8 under 18. Okay?

105
00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.050
P9: Okay?

106
00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:55.170
P9: Alright.

107
00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:59.689
Hieu: So everything has been pretty straightforward for you.

108
00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:00.740
P9: Yes.

109
00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:04.999
Hieu: Okay for this session. I'll give you kind of financial information that you'll need.

110
00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:05.900
Hieu: Okay.

111
00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:16.889
Hieu: in this scenario you and your spouse work and salary has not changed from 2,023 to 2,024 and 2024 is the one that they're asking you here.

112
00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:19.710
P9: Okay? Well.

113
00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:24.900
P9: so they they do not they? You do want me to enter a number in there, or do not.

114
00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:28.140
Hieu: So because it's a demo, you technically won't be.

115
00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:29.515
P9: Don't need any

116
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:34.640
Hieu: You still have to click on it, because we're simulating like you entering the information.

117
00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:35.380
P9: Oh!

118
00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:37.370
Hieu: But it's you can't type anything to.

119
00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:40.530
Hieu: Okay. Okay, click a second time. It'll fill it in.

120
00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.150
P9: Net income from our farm programs.

121
00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:11.609
P9: So I have a question, so basically, whoever's filling this out, are they? Getting this information off their tax returns?

122
00:12:12.817 --> 00:12:18.370
Hieu: That's 1 possibility. There's a couple of other route depending on what the question asks. You.

123
00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:42.910
P9: Okay.

124
00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:55.400
P9: Okay.

125
00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:37.620
Hieu: I noticed that you like to use the kind of the additional information component just to read through the

126
00:13:38.607 --> 00:13:42.589
Hieu: I guess the additional descriptions of each section.

127
00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:44.762
P9: Yeah, it helps cause. Like, if if

128
00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:54.529
P9: if you're confused or you're like getting overwhelmed by a lot of stuff. And then I'm like, well, I don't know what is this considered? And then you click on that. And it's very clear of like.

129
00:13:55.179 --> 00:14:00.129
P9: you know, tuition books, fees, course materials. Okay, yeah, I I get that that makes sense.

130
00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:01.100
Hieu: I gotcha.

131
00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:05.210
P9: That's how my brain, like on other websites, I thought, it's helpful for me, too, because

132
00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:10.379
P9: giving like listing out what to include is so much more helpful.

133
00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:11.180
Hieu: Right.

134
00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:16.519
Hieu: Okay, I'll have you pause right there.

135
00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:16.870
P9: Huh!

136
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:21.380
Hieu: Was any of this financial information part confusing to you.

137
00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:22.680
P9: No.

138
00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:35.589
Hieu: Okay, pretty straightforward, and then on a scale of one to 5, 1 being very easy, 5 being very hard. How difficult would it be for you to complete this section. If you're doing this with real information.

139
00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:46.329
P9: The form itself is not hard. That would be one going and getting all the stuff and adding it up. That part will be hard. But this website's easy.

140
00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:53.900
Hieu: Okay, website. So the one, the website itself is a 1. But like getting the information might be a little bit more difficult.

141
00:14:53.900 --> 00:15:00.996
P9: Yeah, but adding it all up and putting it in but as far as

142
00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:09.810
P9: I don't know if itemizing would be helpful, but at least having the little

143
00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:13.599
P9: example dropdown that that's that's good like this here.

144
00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:14.310
Hieu: I gotcha.

145
00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:25.633
P9: This is important. It's kind of like when you're doing your taxes on like turbo tax. Right? It asks you for something, and you're like, well, what is that? And then they give you this. So this is helpful, because,

146
00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:34.010
P9: it, it makes sense. So is this all inclusive here, or these just examples. So what if the person clicked on this?

147
00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:35.810
P9: Would they?

148
00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:46.340
P9: No, just these 4 things? Or is this just prompting them like these are the types of things that we consider vocational expenses.

149
00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:51.019
Hieu: I am curious, actually on when you're reading this, how does that

150
00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.370
Hieu: like? What's your take on this.

151
00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:56.030
P9: That it would just be just those 4 things.

152
00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:58.940
Hieu: I gotcha. All right. That makes sense.

153
00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:05.729
Hieu: Okay? And then we can continue to next portion. If you're ready.

154
00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:14.290
P9: Alright. So see here.

155
00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:01.169
P9: So here, when it says, when did they become your dependent like?

156
00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:06.810
P9: Because I know it doesn't necessarily have to be a biological family member.

157
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:13.080
P9: But basically here, it's like their date of birth. Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, that's what they're asking. Okay, I get it. Alright.

158
00:17:13.089 --> 00:17:14.999
Hieu: Yeah. Okay. Great.

159
00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:47.369
P9: That doesn't open up. Huh?

160
00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:50.160
Hieu: Yeah, it's not clickable in this demo.

161
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:50.930
P9: That's okay.

162
00:17:52.660 --> 00:18:07.409
Hieu: Okay, I have. You pause right there. So in this scenario you realize that one of your expense was incorrect. You had a big out of pocket dental operation last year of $3,000. How would you go about fixing that error.

163
00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:28.160
P9: Let's see where I saw I saw it up here somewhere, related to.

164
00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:58.090
Hieu: Okay, so right there, it won't click there. But in in this case you see it right there on this page, and then you'll you'll add it in there essentially.

165
00:18:58.090 --> 00:18:58.880
P9: Yeah.

166
00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:07.170
Hieu: So pretty straightforward for you, and then would you prefer to edit on this page, or actually the previous page, where you know it had the.

167
00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:23.297
P9: No, that page is good because I hate it when you have to keep clicking back, and then you might lose your progress. It's really annoying. So just being able to do it, or maybe just having it both like both places, because it's so annoying when you have to hit the back button, and or it's not

168
00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:27.159
Hieu: Gotcha, you lose your space, basically

169
00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:39.439
Hieu: gotcha. And then, for the whole form on a difficulty scale of one to 5, 1 being very easy, and 5 being very hard, how would you rate the whole form? You just went through.

170
00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:40.560
P9: One.

171
00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:42.580
Hieu: One so very easy, then.

172
00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:43.159
P9: Yeah,

173
00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:46.490
Hieu: Just no issue with it.

174
00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:47.500
P9: Nice. Yes.

175
00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:58.230
Hieu: Okay, and then on efficiency scale, one being very easy and 5 being very inefficient. How would you rate the whole form? You just went through.

176
00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:08.031
P9: It was very efficient. I mean, it was pretty straightforward, and it wasn't extremely technical, and the little dropdown boxes were very to the point. So I don't think

177
00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:14.150
P9: it wasn't like 20 different pages you had to go through. So I thought it was really user friendly.

178
00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:15.520
Hieu: I gotcha.

179
00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:19.850
Hieu: Can you scroll up or end the green portion of the demo here?

180
00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:25.240
Hieu: If you scroll up a little bit more? Yep, we'll end there. Yep, and demo.

181
00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:43.009
Hieu: it'll take you back to here. So now that we complete the green option, we'll move on to the red option, and in this option some screen will be the same, some will be different. But this the same, it's the same flow essentially. And then I want you to kind of, you know. Talk out loud again as you're going through this.

182
00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:43.990
P9: Okay.

183
00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:45.700
Hieu: Go ahead and go in there.

184
00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:16.962
Hieu: I'll stop you there right there.

185
00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:18.680
P9: Sorry. Can I go back.

186
00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:20.110
Hieu: Yeah, you can go back.

187
00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:31.639
Hieu: So do you prefer this overview option, this card option? Or do you prefer the detailed page by page one in the previous prototype.

188
00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:32.740
P9: This one.

189
00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:35.050
Hieu: And then can you expand on? Why?

190
00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:44.323
P9: It's just all right there for you, and it's not you know. I think

191
00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:51.793
P9: I feel like I've seen something like this recently when I was accessing it for myself. And I was like, Oh, I like that. That's much better. So

192
00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:56.949
P9: you know, it's just right there and easy and you can. Just.

193
00:21:57.510 --> 00:22:12.134
P9: you know, you don't have to click through several different pages like, let's say I only need to update mine. I don't have to go through all these other things to get to my page or or my spouse's page, and and here and then you could just, you know, and the box is very

194
00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:14.390
P9: like to the point.

195
00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:15.240
Hieu: Yeah.

196
00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:23.265
P9: This very visually. Like it fits well together visually. I don't know the word. I'm trying to succinct, I guess.

197
00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:36.569
P9: And then, if you need to edit just this thing, this mailing address, you can just hit edit there or so this would be just for you, and I assume like, if you.

198
00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:42.879
P9: I guess we'll get on to the next one. But like a place where you would do your dependents, or spouse, or whatever.

199
00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:46.630
Hieu: Okay, I got you. Yes, go ahead. We can move on. Then.

200
00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:47.500
P9: Okay.

201
00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:56.399
P9: okay, it's pretty easy.

202
00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:08.479
P9: So did you want me to go into it? Or just like this page is okay, go to the next.

203
00:23:08.758 --> 00:23:15.160
Hieu: No. So if you were to do this with real information, would you be going into it to kind of review that information.

204
00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:20.142
P9: Oh, oh, well, if I knew I was still married to Jordan, I wouldn't go in it.

205
00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:26.910
Hieu: Okay. So you just for you, you'll just check that. This is your spouse and then move on.

206
00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:27.620
P9: Yeah.

207
00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:30.010
Hieu: I gotcha. Go ahead and click continue.

208
00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:09.249
Hieu: and then I'll pause you right here.

209
00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:21.839
Hieu: You can use the previous information I gave you. It's the exact same scenario that you and your spouse's work and salary has not changed from 2,023 to 2,024. Okay, go ahead.

210
00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:36.139
P9: Okay, hold on a second.

211
00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:53.989
P9: So this right here was what I already had in the system beforehand.

212
00:24:55.280 --> 00:25:01.690
P9: this area here, because you see how this one has a what we consider gross annual income.

213
00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:02.340
Hieu: Yeah.

214
00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:06.569
P9: But then there's not a drop here.

215
00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:10.700
P9: I don't know if there needs to be, but.

216
00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:17.029
Hieu: You're thinking that you want it, or that you may want some kind of drop there.

217
00:25:17.743 --> 00:25:23.389
P9: Net income income after any taxes and other deductions are subtracted.

218
00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:30.570
P9: Yeah, that's really that's kind of confusing for me a little bit. Because

219
00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:35.880
P9: is so, this right here that says, your net income from 2023.

220
00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:45.000
P9: When I look at it right here underneath this in my brain. It it wants to think like that was my income from just the farm and property

221
00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:46.700
P9: and business.

222
00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:50.170
P9: So I don't know if this

223
00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:55.539
P9: is my net income, or are they asking, Is this

224
00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:59.870
P9: my net income from a farm, or is this net income from everything?

225
00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:04.350
Hieu: I gotcha. So it's not completely clear on the label for that.

226
00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:05.060
P9: Yeah.

227
00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:07.420
Hieu: Okay. Good. To know.

228
00:26:08.550 --> 00:26:12.039
P9: So annual income from a farm property or business.

229
00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:20.442
P9: Yeah, I don't know. It'd be interesting to consider maybe a dropdown for that. I don't know but or it might be considered

230
00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:25.670
P9: I'm just the kind of person where I like to have it like this.

231
00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:34.930
Hieu: Yeah. And then in the in the net income there, what would you expect it to be in the dropdown

232
00:26:35.850 --> 00:26:37.100
Hieu: breakdown? Yeah.

233
00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:40.670
P9: Yeah, just like it is here.

234
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:41.620
Hieu: Yeah.

235
00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:45.319
P9: And then that just to keep it the same.

236
00:26:46.670 --> 00:26:51.909
Hieu: So it would technically be the same information, like tip wages, bonuses as well.

237
00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:53.970
P9: For the farm, one for the farm, one.

238
00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:57.030
Hieu: Okay, so the farm and property it.

239
00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:02.740
P9: I don't know if. Yeah, I don't know if there could be a drop down here. I maybe it's not any different. But

240
00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:06.350
P9: Gee! I don't know.

241
00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:11.720
Hieu: Okay, but you're not quite sure. But you think that's that's like confusing. And you need a little bit more.

242
00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:13.519
P9: It is a little confusing. Yeah.

243
00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:14.430
Hieu: Gotcha.

244
00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:20.869
P9: I think I think what I'm reading here is, it's saying my net income from farm property or business is 47,798.

245
00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:26.720
P9: Then my gross annual income is 62, 4.

246
00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:47.149
P9: So yeah, I don't know where this number is coming from, is it? Is it? Oh, I think I know this number is my gross income minus my deductions. Right? Is that what this number is? The 47, 7, 9, 8.

247
00:27:47.150 --> 00:27:48.580
Hieu: That's how you're reading it.

248
00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:52.330
Hieu: Okay.

249
00:27:52.330 --> 00:27:57.659
P9: If it is, but if it is, it will be nice to have a little thing down here that says

250
00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:00.869
P9: gross minus deductions or something.

251
00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:01.859
Hieu: I gotcha.

252
00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:05.650
P9: Cause it's right under the farm, so I'm like, I don't know.

253
00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:08.029
Hieu: That's throwing you off a little bit. That great box.

254
00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:15.949
P9: And it's and then it has this net ink which makes sense here. Right? You're asking me my net income from a farm property or business.

255
00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:23.340
P9: But is this here? Yeah, because it's falling right under this farm property business

256
00:28:24.083 --> 00:28:26.506
P9: heading. It's a little confusing.

257
00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:37.078
Hieu: I gotcha. So the label for that gray box for the net income is confusing, because it might not have the farm property and or business

258
00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:39.390
P9: Yeah, I'm just not

259
00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:54.649
P9: sure if that number is my net income from the farm and property, or is it my, my total of you know, with my deductions. It's just kind of unclear. I'm not real sure.

260
00:28:54.650 --> 00:28:57.930
Hieu: Okay, that's fair. Thank you for that feedback.

261
00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:06.870
P9: Okay, okay. I mean, the rest is pretty good.

262
00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:10.180
Hieu: Gotcha, you can continue.

263
00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:11.240
P9: Okay.

264
00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:23.330
P9: yeah. So like, this is good that you have that

265
00:29:23.867 --> 00:29:35.480
P9: so I was thinking something like that. But maybe, like you don't have to, you know, rewrite this whole paragraph every time. But maybe just something quick, like gross income.

266
00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:42.640
P9: minus deductions, or is the, you know, something

267
00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:48.510
P9: I I like the explanation. It's really nice, and if it's too much you could always do the dropdown box.

268
00:29:49.050 --> 00:29:49.610
Hieu: Gotcha.

269
00:29:49.610 --> 00:29:55.140
P9: Much like on the page itself, and it's overwhelming. Just do the drop down box, and then.

270
00:29:56.390 --> 00:29:57.050
Hieu: Yeah.

271
00:29:57.050 --> 00:29:59.399
P9: Like these dropdown boxes are awesome.

272
00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:00.770
Hieu: Gotcha.

273
00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:11.760
P9: So when it says your spouse's net income.

274
00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:16.849
P9: do they? Again, is it the farm and property income? Or is it?

275
00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:20.240
P9: Yeah, as that's confusing again for me.

276
00:30:20.410 --> 00:30:21.560
Hieu: I gotcha.

277
00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:29.340
Hieu: The the title of it is not completely connected. So you're not sure if it's the same thing or something else different.

278
00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:36.610
P9: Yeah, cause to me when I see this gray box underneath this, I think it's asking me my spouse's net income from farm property or business.

279
00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:37.820
Hieu: Gotcha.

280
00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:52.810
P9: Okay, yeah. So it's just the same area. But other than this pretty straightforward

281
00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:08.850
P9: oops. So did I. Hit

282
00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:36.490
P9: is that is, is that list exhaustive? Or is that everything right there? Sorry it keeps dropping down.

283
00:31:38.510 --> 00:31:42.010
P9: or those just examples, because if there's more.

284
00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:44.399
P9: Now, ophthalmology or something.

285
00:31:44.690 --> 00:31:48.449
P9: You might wanna have an option to click on a link somewhere and list them all.

286
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:54.770
Hieu: Okay. So if you if you think that there's more out of exhaustive list, you want a link or.

287
00:31:54.770 --> 00:32:02.210
P9: Yeah, and that that would be for the previous ones as well, cause it's just like when you're doing your taxes. Turbotax. You're like

288
00:32:03.170 --> 00:32:12.929
P9: it might, it'll say like examples would be, and they give you 5. But then you can click on a link, and then and it's exhaustive, just like if you went to the irs.gov website like

289
00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:16.630
P9: cause someone might have like, I don't know

290
00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:26.479
P9: what's it called like they had to pay out of pocket for a motorized scooter or something, and they're like, Well, where does that fall in there, you know.

291
00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:29.860
Hieu: I gotcha it could. It could be helpful, maybe.

292
00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:30.250
Hieu: Right.

293
00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:33.970
Hieu: Thank you for that feedback.

294
00:32:39.130 --> 00:32:45.090
P9: so so here it's assuming, we've already entered this in somewhere else, right this number.

295
00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:45.490
Hieu: Right.

296
00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:46.270
P9: Okay.

297
00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:58.470
P9: okay.

298
00:33:06.270 --> 00:33:09.460
P9: okay, that's that makes sense.

299
00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:36.300
Hieu: Any thoughts on that.

300
00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:41.399
P9: I was gonna click on this first.st Yeah. So I do actually have one.

301
00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:51.840
Hieu: Okay, stop you right there for the financial information here. Besides that gray box. Was there anything else that was confusing to you?

302
00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:54.659
P9: And the one I just clicked pass.

303
00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:56.770
Hieu: Yeah, you can go back if you want to.

304
00:33:56.770 --> 00:33:59.579
P9: Yeah, I wanted to go back to it and look at it real quick.

305
00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:14.800
P9: Do you total it out anywhere, like with everyone.

306
00:34:15.850 --> 00:34:18.800
Hieu: For this one. No, there's no totaling out.

307
00:34:19.139 --> 00:34:26.379
P9: For the whole household. You just you put veteran spouse deductible, that's it. Not like total household.

308
00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:27.190
Hieu: No.

309
00:34:27.199 --> 00:34:27.899
P9: Okay.

310
00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:29.390
Hieu: Not in this form at least.

311
00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:30.960
P9: Okay. Okay.

312
00:34:31.949 --> 00:34:33.659
Hieu: And then pause right there.

313
00:34:34.050 --> 00:34:39.669
Hieu: How is this financial session compared to the previous prototype you just went through.

314
00:34:39.679 --> 00:34:41.579
P9: That one's better. This one's better.

315
00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:43.319
Hieu: Okay. Oh, why is that.

316
00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:54.680
P9: The layout and it I mean.

317
00:34:54.940 --> 00:35:02.829
P9: they're both really succinct and easy to use. But this layout, I feel, was was clear, and

318
00:35:03.070 --> 00:35:04.299
P9: it just was.

319
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.274
P9: I just found it easier to use.

320
00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:09.550
Hieu: Gotcha.

321
00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:15.546
P9: I mean it lays it out for you. It spells it out for you.

322
00:35:16.110 --> 00:35:24.150
P9: and it's easy to click through, and there's not too much on the page, you know. You could always do click boxes. There's not. It's not

323
00:35:24.370 --> 00:35:26.810
P9: like, Oh, my gosh! There's so much on this so!

324
00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:28.370
P9: And then.

325
00:35:28.370 --> 00:35:29.179
Hieu: Can you?

326
00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:35.169
Hieu: Can you actually go back to like 2 pages? I'm just curious. And one more. Yeah.

327
00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:37.370
P9: Yeah.

328
00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:43.299
Hieu: So for this page, for instance, when you saw the can you scroll up? Let's say, the

329
00:35:43.850 --> 00:35:48.419
Hieu: yeah. One of this number. The deductible here, stop right there.

330
00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:57.519
Hieu: So when you saw the 2,023 financial number, did it help you decide on what to do next? Or did it make you second guess on what's the current.

331
00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:00.989
P9: Which part of this right here.

332
00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:07.529
Hieu: Let's say, let's say you see your education expense from 2,023 here in the gray box.

333
00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:08.420
P9: Right here.

334
00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:12.230
Hieu: When you see that, what does that make you decide to do

335
00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:17.269
Hieu: like, I know, for the spouse and the

336
00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:25.650
Hieu: the net income that was confusing to you because the label wasn't the same. So that was making you question it. What about this.

337
00:36:32.570 --> 00:36:35.770
P9: So when you say your this is just for the veteran.

338
00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:37.560
P9: Oh, that says household.

339
00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.759
P9: So maybe household non re.

340
00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:51.719
Hieu: Sorry. Let me take a step back here. I was just curious on what your thought was on that gray box reference. It's reference.

341
00:36:52.570 --> 00:36:57.030
Hieu: your previous kind of the previous information you've entered.

342
00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:00.480
Hieu: Yeah, that one.

343
00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:05.340
P9: Like, does it sync up well with this area? Is that what you mean?

344
00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:10.409
Hieu: Like kind of. It's a very open, ended question in terms of

345
00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:14.776
P9: Okay, so this, this is

346
00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:20.610
P9: the education expenses. That's just for veteran, not for veteran and spouse, right? Or.

347
00:37:20.610 --> 00:37:21.110
Hieu: Right.

348
00:37:21.110 --> 00:37:26.420
P9: Or dependents, too, are we? Just so maybe maybe

349
00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:33.810
P9: enter the amount yours paid. Number medical, okay, college or vocational to your own.

350
00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:51.237
P9: Yeah, maybe just make it clear like, are you looking like? Let's say I'm in school. But my kids in school, too, are are you asking me for me in college because that veterans like are using 9, 11, and then their kids might be going as well. So maybe

351
00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:56.470
P9: is, are you? Do you only care about what the veterans paying for themselves, or is it

352
00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:58.390
P9: family? I don't know.

353
00:37:59.090 --> 00:38:01.650
Hieu: Right I mean for this, let's say.

354
00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:04.890
Hieu: oh, it says, Oh, I see only your own. Okay.

355
00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:12.279
P9: There. My my answer was, my question was answered right there, because it says only for you, not your dependents. Okay.

356
00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:24.569
Hieu: Okay? And then I guess my follow up question would be for this gray box here. By giving you your previous information you enter. Does that help you enter the current information?

357
00:38:25.090 --> 00:38:28.099
Hieu: 2024, or not really.

358
00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:40.726
P9: Not not really, because I mean, it doesn't hurt to be there because it gives you an idea of like. Oh, last year I put this, and maybe I have about the same this year. I I don't think it hurts to put last year's in there.

359
00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:44.940
P9: I don't. I don't think it's a problem. Okay.

360
00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:48.659
P9: it's it's neutral. It doesn't help it or hurt it.

361
00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:50.720
Hieu: I gotcha.

362
00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:52.450
P9: But sure, why not.

363
00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:57.650
Hieu: No, no, I like that. Answer that. It's neutral. It doesn't help or hurt it.

364
00:38:57.650 --> 00:38:58.850
P9: Yeah, yeah.

365
00:38:59.650 --> 00:39:05.770
Hieu: Alright. Thank you for that. We can move on to the next portion here and then.

366
00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:09.830
Hieu: and then I think you were on the review page.

367
00:39:10.755 --> 00:39:11.380
P9: Okay.

368
00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:12.509
Hieu: The top there.

369
00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:20.230
Hieu: So when I say this is very similar to what you went through before, I don't know if you want to look through that again or not.

370
00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:24.720
P9: Okay.

371
00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:53.420
Hieu: And then I'll pause you again, for right here.

372
00:39:53.480 --> 00:40:21.069
Hieu: So, if you remember, in the last scenario, your medical expense was incorrect in this scenario. It would also be incorrect. And I'm curious if the previous page, where it shows the summary or this review page, where it shows also, like the overall summary. If you were corrected, which area makes more sense to you, it would be this page, or the previous page, or even the one where you're entering in that information.

373
00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:39.319
P9: No, I wouldn't want to have to click back all those pages to get to where I entered it to fix it. I'd like to have one more time at the very end, just to do it right then and there, and and edit at that point before. Just like, if you're shopping online. You review your cart and then edit it.

374
00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:41.110
Hieu: Yeah.

375
00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:48.820
P9: So I would say, having it at the end would be better.

376
00:40:49.450 --> 00:41:05.519
Hieu: I gotcha, and then, in terms of just the financial portion of this, so far on a scale of a 1 to 5, 1 being very easy, 5 being very hard. How hard would it be for you to complete the Financial information section if you're doing it with real information.

377
00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:13.330
P9: One or 2.

378
00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:15.650
Hieu: One or 2. And why is that.

379
00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:32.780
P9: hmm!

380
00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:40.909
P9: That's a good question. Can I go back to that area where you entered it?

381
00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:42.340
Hieu: Yes, yes, you can.

382
00:41:43.690 --> 00:41:45.550
P9: Okay, I have to scroll down right and go back.

383
00:41:45.550 --> 00:41:46.280
Hieu: Yeah.

384
00:41:52.530 --> 00:41:56.520
P9: Is that here or no one more?

385
00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:00.360
P9: Okay.

386
00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:16.780
P9: yeah, I think the only thing is the same one as last one is here. That's kind of confusing when it goes from farm and property, and then it jumps there. It's kind of

387
00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:23.919
P9: I don't think it's hard to do, just maybe like

388
00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:34.369
P9: filling the form out in general, even if it was a paper version. It's just a lot of things you gotta put. But it's all necessary things you need to do. But as far as like using this, this is

389
00:42:35.290 --> 00:42:40.504
P9: pretty easy. It's just like click. It's a lot easier, a lot more efficient than paper.

390
00:42:44.910 --> 00:42:47.575
P9: I like the dropdown boxes because

391
00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:50.740
P9: it doesn't all have to be

392
00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:57.270
P9: all on there, because that would be way too much.

393
00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:58.020
Hieu: Right.

394
00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:04.220
P9: So what does this say here? What we consider gross annual income? And then you click on that.

395
00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:14.669
P9: Why does it? That's weird.

396
00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:17.230
Hieu: Oh, what is weird?

397
00:43:21.210 --> 00:43:25.940
P9: So I see this says gross income from work, what we consider gross annual income.

398
00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:31.740
P9: Oh, I see. Okay, I understand.

399
00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:35.108
P9: I thought it was.

400
00:43:35.870 --> 00:43:41.539
P9: yeah, you have to look at this little arrow, if it's up or down to see if you're opened

401
00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:46.300
P9: the additional box or not. I was. I was getting confused.

402
00:43:46.810 --> 00:43:48.350
Hieu: Arrows, making you confuse.

403
00:43:48.350 --> 00:43:50.733
P9: You have to look at which way the arrow is going.

404
00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:56.827
P9: That's good down. Pull it back up alright. Okay, yeah.

405
00:43:57.420 --> 00:44:02.129
P9: I don't think it's hard to use. I mean, it's pretty. It's pretty self explanatory.

406
00:44:02.130 --> 00:44:05.319
Hieu: You're you're rating it like a 1 or 2 essentially.

407
00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:09.170
P9: Yeah, yeah, I don't think it's like to.

408
00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:11.640
P9: I don't think it's hard.

409
00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:12.960
Hieu: I gotcha.

410
00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:19.669
Hieu: that's fair, and then we could go. Well, we can stop here. But on the over on the

411
00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:29.589
Hieu: on the overall, entire form on a difficulty, scale of one to 5, 1 being very easy and 5 being very hard, how would you rate the overall form.

412
00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:32.480
P9: The the difficulty to complete it.

413
00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:33.220
Hieu: Yeah.

414
00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:34.390
P9: Just one.

415
00:44:34.390 --> 00:44:35.180
Hieu: This one.

416
00:44:35.350 --> 00:44:36.990
Hieu: Yes, very easy again.

417
00:44:36.990 --> 00:44:38.390
P9: Yeah, very easy.

418
00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:49.359
Hieu: Gotcha, and then for the efficiency scale of one to 5, 1 being very efficient and 5 being very inefficient, how would you rate the entire form you just went through.

419
00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:56.929
Hieu: It's gonna again. It's gonna be the one or 2. So 1.5 alright, that is fair.

420
00:44:56.930 --> 00:44:57.330
P9: It's like.

421
00:44:57.780 --> 00:45:03.110
P9: It's I, I would say, if any changes were needed barely any.

422
00:45:03.110 --> 00:45:03.940
Hieu: Gotcha.

423
00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:10.349
P9: Maybe just that gray box area that I had pointed out. That's a little confusing where the farm area is.

424
00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:11.740
P9: Of them, but.

425
00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:16.040
Hieu: You want more of like an update on the the content of it? Really.

426
00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:19.210
P9: Yeah, it just needs to be more clear what you're asking for.

427
00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:24.950
Hieu: Gotcha. And then what is your overall thoughts on the 2 prototype? We just went through.

428
00:45:25.810 --> 00:45:28.270
P9: The the overall. I I think it's great.

429
00:45:28.270 --> 00:45:29.770
Hieu: For both. Okay.

430
00:45:29.770 --> 00:45:36.549
P9: I think it's great. I think it's really good. It's important. The one thing where I work in the homeless services

431
00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:40.359
P9: veterans not accessing this online.

432
00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:55.959
P9: It delays them by weeks because they don't. They have to go do the old paper form, so they have to go get it, go, fill it out, take into enrollment and eligibility. Then we have to wait for it to to get done. So we're talking.

433
00:45:56.180 --> 00:46:19.649
P9: They're waiting on this to be completed so they can get homeless services versus if this were more accessible you know, it would just be so much easier for them. The biggest issue. I think that I see my veterans have is setting up their my health. Vet. That is the biggest problem they get confused. They can't remember their passwords, I tell them.

434
00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:38.840
P9: go into the Va. They've got an office set up just for that. So that that's a barrier in and of itself. But this like for someone like me. I grew up with all of this stuff. I think it's great. It's amazing. But we're talking about other people who may not have a lot of access to the Internet. Maybe they're.

435
00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:45.430
P9: you know, a lot of older generation. They don't. I noticed

436
00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:52.369
P9: and even my dad being a 7 year old veteran. He's always like, I can't figure this out, you know, and so.

437
00:46:52.650 --> 00:46:57.730
P9: but that's because I think to a cultural thing and an age thing, because

438
00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:00.560
P9: for me I'm 44. This is fine.

439
00:47:01.090 --> 00:47:07.910
P9: It doesn't intimidate me. Confuse me. I think the overall

440
00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:12.030
P9: thing that's a barriers them actually

441
00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:14.379
P9: getting into my health vet. Using.

442
00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:15.439
Hieu: I gotcha.

443
00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:24.690
P9: Getting the premium account, like those are the things I think, that prevent them from using these wonderful tools. That delay their.

444
00:47:24.690 --> 00:47:27.490
Hieu: That's the biggest barrier of entry. Essentially.

445
00:47:27.490 --> 00:47:28.520
P9: Absolutely.

446
00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:31.419
Hieu: I gotcha. Thank you. You can stop sharing now.

447
00:47:31.590 --> 00:47:34.900
Hieu: I do have a couple more questions for you.

448
00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:42.670
Hieu: Can you elaborate on the kind of homelessness, portion of it. I'm curious when they fill that paper form.

449
00:47:42.670 --> 00:47:43.030
P9: Yeah.

450
00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:46.819
Hieu: Because they're homeless. They don't have like a home address. How does.

451
00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:48.819
P9: Right. So

452
00:47:50.180 --> 00:47:58.220
P9: They don't have to have a lot of times. If let's say they're street homeless, they'll just put the medical hospitals address.

453
00:47:58.540 --> 00:47:59.550
Hieu: I gotcha.

454
00:47:59.550 --> 00:48:01.829
P9: So whatever the address is of the hospital.

455
00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:05.119
Hieu: You mean the Va facility.

456
00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:12.559
P9: Yeah. So if they don't have a po box and they don't have a mailing address, then usually they'll just enter in the Va's hospital

457
00:48:13.533 --> 00:48:14.680
P9: or or

458
00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:19.140
P9: Yeah, they do that so.

459
00:48:19.250 --> 00:48:28.499
P9: but getting them to go, do it and get down there in the transportation and do it in person is such a pain, and it really causes a lot of issues.

460
00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:37.350
P9: So you know, how do, how do you improve access to use these tools?

461
00:48:37.350 --> 00:48:43.419
Hieu: Right. And so you mentioned that there is like a coordination effort needed to get to the hospital there

462
00:48:44.690 --> 00:48:53.939
Hieu: and then do you direct them to, or someone in there. If they're homeless, that let them know that you just put the hospital address essentially.

463
00:48:54.450 --> 00:49:07.609
P9: I am not involved in that part. It's just what I see. So I assume. Who's ever at enrollment or eligibility, or whoever's entering in the self information. If they don't, and sometimes I'll see another one that says no temporary address, and then.

464
00:49:07.610 --> 00:49:08.320
Hieu: I got you.

465
00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:11.706
P9: I think it works the Va's Medical Center.

466
00:49:12.130 --> 00:49:12.520
Hieu: Right.

467
00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:14.360
P9: Usually that clues us in like.

468
00:49:14.850 --> 00:49:16.079
Hieu: They're probably. And then

469
00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:21.749
Hieu: are you? Are you behind the scenes in helping them coordinate to get to the kind of the Va. Facility then.

470
00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:49.890
P9: No, no, I don't do that part, but if they call the national homeless hotline they may not be enrolled in the Va. But maybe they're they may not necessarily be va healthcare eligible, but they're eligible for the homeless services that they need to fill out this 10 easy. They'll call the hotline and then boom barrier. We can't. I can't refer you to this program because you're not in the system. You've got to go down to the Va, and fill out the 10 easy. And then.

471
00:49:50.400 --> 00:50:09.170
P9: you know. So here you are. I can't even put a note in for you, because you're not even in the system, so I've got a pen and paper it like, Make sure you follow up with this person, and then you call them 2 weeks later. I haven't gone down there. I don't have a car, or, you know, so that that creates barriers and delays. You know.

472
00:50:09.170 --> 00:50:10.370
Hieu: I gotcha.

473
00:50:10.810 --> 00:50:13.600
P9: That that part's a little harder, but I don't know.

474
00:50:15.250 --> 00:50:17.950
P9: I don't know what a solution for that would be.

475
00:50:20.670 --> 00:50:30.239
Hieu: So. I am curious, then, if they were in the system then, and then they became homeless. How would you instruct them to?

476
00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:32.070
Hieu: I guess.

477
00:50:32.330 --> 00:50:40.950
P9: Well, hopefully, they'd already have a if they've if they're already in the system, then then they're already enrolled in va health care usually.

478
00:50:42.130 --> 00:50:45.970
P9: so I don't.

479
00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:54.809
P9: I think the only time I've heard enrollment asked me to tell the veteran is like if if it needs to be recertified.

480
00:50:55.130 --> 00:51:13.520
P9: and they'll ask them to fill it out. But we won't. We won't like halt giving them homeless services. If they're in there. We just say you need to go down there when you have a chance and update your information. But it's good to know that they can do this online because I didn't even put 2 and 2 together, so I could actually tell them if

481
00:51:13.950 --> 00:51:14.689
P9: you know.

482
00:51:14.690 --> 00:51:15.820
Hieu: I gotcha.

483
00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:30.140
P9: Yeah. So I think messaging, probably letting people like employees at the Va know because they just the hotline is gonna tell them to just go physically, go down to the Va and fill out the form. That's what they're gonna say.

484
00:51:30.410 --> 00:51:31.590
Hieu: I gotcha

485
00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:39.639
Hieu: as of right now. I don't think we have a way to intake the homeless address portion at least.

486
00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:48.309
Hieu: But other than that. Yeah, they can't fill it out online. And then I do have a couple of more questions here before we end our

487
00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:52.270
Hieu: interview. I'll share my screen for this portion.

488
00:51:52.270 --> 00:51:52.960
P9: Okay.

489
00:51:57.780 --> 00:52:02.030
Hieu: I'm ready here, and then can you see my screen.

490
00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:02.590
P9: Yes.

491
00:52:02.830 --> 00:52:14.059
Hieu: So if you take a look, we have 3 different options here, each showing your personal information in a different way. Can you walk through your thoughts here, and do you have a preference of which one you like best?

492
00:52:14.060 --> 00:52:16.560
P9: Are you able to increase the size at all?

493
00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:18.080
Hieu: Yeah, I can zoom in.

494
00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:22.250
Hieu: So maybe I can zoom in and then slowly pan pan through.

495
00:52:23.130 --> 00:52:23.870
Hieu: Okay.

496
00:52:27.110 --> 00:52:31.839
P9: Okay, B. And then, can I see C.

497
00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:32.430
Hieu: Yep.

498
00:52:36.250 --> 00:52:38.639
P9: Okay, can I see B and A again.

499
00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:39.490
Hieu: Yep.

500
00:52:40.100 --> 00:52:41.189
P9: I like b.

501
00:52:44.770 --> 00:52:46.739
Hieu: Select B, and then why is that.

502
00:52:48.610 --> 00:52:54.059
P9: My eye is drawn more towards it, so I can filter out all the unnecessary information.

503
00:52:54.250 --> 00:52:56.769
Hieu: I gotcha that makes sense.

504
00:52:56.770 --> 00:52:59.390
P9: It's quick like my eye goes straight to the box.

505
00:52:59.650 --> 00:53:00.480
Hieu: Right.

506
00:53:01.145 --> 00:53:06.310
P9: And if I need to look at that other stuff I can. But the other stuff my eye wants to look at it all.

507
00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:07.940
Hieu: I gotcha.

508
00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:14.899
Hieu: and then for the marital status we have 2 different options here A, the drop down, and B with the bubbles.

509
00:53:19.683 --> 00:53:21.969
P9: The bubbles, cause I don't have to click twice.

510
00:53:22.330 --> 00:53:26.139
Hieu: Alright that makes sense. So in a scenario, let's say

511
00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:44.919
Hieu: for previously you're you're married. Fill out the spouse information whatnot. And then, for whatever reason, let's say, if you went divorced or widow, and you select that option when you click the continue button, you'll see this screen, this alert message here.

512
00:53:45.490 --> 00:53:51.539
Hieu: Can you explain to me what this message means to you? Assuming that this is like either divorce or widow.

513
00:53:51.910 --> 00:53:57.840
P9: Yeah, it's just telling you before you do this, make sure what you're wanting to do is accurate.

514
00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:06.630
P9: stopping you to think before in case you accidentally, maybe you accidentally click the wrong choice.

515
00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:08.909
Hieu: So this makes sense to you. There's no.

516
00:54:08.910 --> 00:54:09.650
P9: I think so.

517
00:54:10.250 --> 00:54:14.849
P9: Yeah, it's like a stopgap, I think, like a quality control type thing to make sure.

518
00:54:15.340 --> 00:54:19.490
Hieu: Right that makes sense, and then

519
00:54:20.810 --> 00:54:23.480
Hieu: I have one last one here.

520
00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:23.990
P9: Hmm.

521
00:54:25.420 --> 00:54:34.459
Hieu: this is the kind of 2 different ways of showing the financial information here, or at least asking for it and then displaying it.

522
00:54:54.830 --> 00:55:00.250
Hieu: Yeah, it's like, my brain is like, this is a lot when I'm looking at all of it, right?

523
00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:10.350
P9: But if I had to pick the 2

524
00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:15.888
P9: yeah, cause my brain's like firing off right now, like looking at all this information.

525
00:55:17.110 --> 00:55:18.679
Hieu: That's a lot of information.

526
00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:21.849
P9: Gross income. I know your spouses.

527
00:55:27.150 --> 00:55:32.209
P9: Probably the left. I'm starting to get confused when I see this stuff from last year.

528
00:55:32.210 --> 00:55:33.870
Hieu: I gotcha so.

529
00:55:33.870 --> 00:55:49.179
P9: Maybe if you want to put that there, that's fine, but make it a drop down box with all the with all that numbers on there, and everything I start thinking like, well, what? What's that number like? That's that's like a lot of it's good to know, but not necessary.

530
00:55:49.180 --> 00:55:50.340
Hieu: Not necessary.

531
00:55:50.340 --> 00:55:57.300
P9: Yeah, if I wanted to know it, maybe I could click on it. But but having that number there is, gonna get my brain all confused. And

532
00:55:57.480 --> 00:55:58.360
P9: yeah.

533
00:55:59.310 --> 00:56:05.390
Hieu: I gotcha so it it could be helpful. But it doesn't have to be in this type of format.

534
00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:17.809
P9: Yeah. I mean, if they if if you want to put like a little thing to click on to to see it. Yeah. But it's not really necessarily because you're asking for 2024. So yeah.

535
00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:20.400
Hieu: Gotcha. Thank you for that.

536
00:56:20.970 --> 00:56:23.459
Hieu: I'll stop right there and then.

537
00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:29.300
Hieu: I think that's it. The end of the interview. Do you have any questions for me?

538
00:56:29.300 --> 00:56:32.318
P9: No, that's it. Thank you. That's interesting to go through that stuff.

539
00:56:32.570 --> 00:56:51.549
Hieu: Of course I don't have any questions. I'll see if my colleagues have any, but aside from that, I want to say that wraps it up. I want to circle back and reconfirm that you are comfortable. If we share a video clip of you know this session. Assuming we erase any kind of identifying information.

540
00:56:51.550 --> 00:56:51.890
P9: Sure that.

541
00:56:51.890 --> 00:56:53.080
Hieu: Alrighty.

542
00:56:54.180 --> 00:57:06.840
Hieu: So I want to say that we appreciate you taking your time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback will be very helpful as we continue to update the site and the product for it to be kind of useful for all veterans.

543
00:57:06.840 --> 00:57:07.530
P9: Hi.

544
00:57:07.530 --> 00:57:20.919
Hieu: And then, lastly, bridging will send you like a thank you with a little thank you. Note with a little blurb that you can pass to other veterans that you know, to provide them with a chance to participate in like future studies like this one.

545
00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:21.790
P9: Yeah, yeah.

546
00:57:21.790 --> 00:57:25.869
Hieu: Other than that. Thank you. Have a nice day. Enjoy the rest of your day.

547
00:57:25.870 --> 00:57:28.419
P9: Yeah, thanks. You've been kind, happy. 4th of July. Have a good day.

548
00:57:28.420 --> 00:57:30.639
Hieu: Alright, happy 4th of July! Enjoy.

549
00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:31.490
P9: Alright, bye-bye.

550
00:57:31.490 --> 00:57:32.260
Hieu: Bye, bye.
