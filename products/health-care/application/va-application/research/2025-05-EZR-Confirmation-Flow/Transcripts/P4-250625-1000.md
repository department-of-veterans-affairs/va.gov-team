1
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:08.420
Hieu: Okay, I have started recording, I'd like to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talked today.

2
00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:09.220
P4: Yes.

3
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:17.670
Hieu: Alright, and then are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with our kind of other Va partners.

4
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:18.520
P4: Yes.

5
00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:29.316
Hieu: All right. Thank you for that. And that's kind of the technical aspect of it. So we'll warm up with a couple of questions here before we look at the prototype.

6
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.320
Hieu: do you have a service-connected disability rating at the Va.

7
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.440
P4: Yes.

8
00:00:35.992 --> 00:00:36.959
Hieu: What is that?

9
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.590
P4: What is the disability?

10
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.789
Hieu: Yeah, what is that? No? Sorry? What is the disability rating.

11
00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.189
P4: Oh, the rating! The total rating's 80%.

12
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.689
Hieu: 80%. Okay, thank you. And then, have you recently visited the va.gov website?

13
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:53.990
P4: Yes.

14
00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:55.840
Hieu: And then may I ask, for what reason?

15
00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:02.192
P4: Well, it's it's a portal that I use a lot, especially when I go ahead and

16
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.470
P4: when I go to look up information about any and all.

17
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.820
P4: I'm trying to think of the word, any and all.

18
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.000
P4: Basically, I go to look for updates. And

19
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:27.740
P4: in in my rating classification, and if I have to add anything to the portal, so I use it regularly.

20
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.940
Hieu: I see. All right. That's good to know.

21
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:52.690
Hieu: So we'll get. We'll jump right into the prototype thing. Then today we'll go through 2 different prototypes. One is option green and one's option red. Imagine that you have a spouse and one dependent. And then for this scenario you have filled out a similar form before. And now they're asking you to update your financial information

22
00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:02.159
Hieu: in this scenario. You have already kind of logged into the va.gov account where the system pre-filled some of the information for you.

23
00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.549
Hieu: Now for this scenario. Are you comfortable with sharing your screen and talk through that?

24
00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:14.559
Hieu: Yes, sure, all right, let me give you a link to the prototype.

25
00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:18.637
Hieu: And then, while that's loading

26
00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:25.579
Hieu: please make sure to kind of close any kind of personal information, Facebook or whatnot before you

27
00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:27.369
Hieu: share your screen.

28
00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:53.880
Hieu: Are you able to see the link that I've sent

29
00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:57.679
Hieu: you? Do not let me try to send it again.

30
00:02:58.259 --> 00:03:01.999
Hieu: Are you able to see the zoom, chat.

31
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.019
P4: I'm just able to see you and the other observers.

32
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.572
Hieu: Okay, are you on a desktop or a

33
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.110
P4: Yeah, yeah, desktop

34
00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.949
Hieu: Okay. So at the bottom of your zoom screen there is a couple of icons, and one of it is a chat icon.

35
00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:19.454
P4: Yeah,

36
00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.039
Hieu: So if you click on chat, you should be able to see the link that I sent.

37
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.549
P4: And just double click on it.

38
00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.809
Hieu: Yes, I think one. Yes, double click should work.

39
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.379
Hieu: and then it should take a you know, a couple seconds to load everything.

40
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.040
P4: Okay.

41
00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:49.549
Hieu: Okay, once that's loaded on your zoom screen, there is a kind of green share arrow share button.

42
00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.519
Hieu: You click on that. And then I think they ask you an option to what on your screen to share.

43
00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.080
Hieu: if you can share your like, the one with the

44
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.750
Hieu: one with the prototype which would be in a browser.

45
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.090
P4: All that I see is update your Va health benefits, information, health benefits. Update. It's like a window that opened.

46
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.180
Hieu: Yeah. So that's the window that you share.

47
00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.970
P4: Okay.

48
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:19.860
Hieu: So

49
00:04:20.858 --> 00:04:27.749
Hieu: in your zoom screen at the bottom there is a couple of different icon, and one of it's a green arrow.

50
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:35.160
Hieu: There's no green arrow. All what it tells me to do is to go ahead, and next next frame.

51
00:04:36.361 --> 00:04:43.209
Hieu: Sorry, not on, not on the prototype itself, but on your zoom screen. So if you go back to your zoom screen.

52
00:04:45.305 --> 00:04:46.240
P4: Okay.

53
00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.939
Hieu: And then on the bottom of your zoom screen. There's it's like the 5th icon.

54
00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.789
Hieu: So it's the middle icon.

55
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.570
Hieu: It's a green arrow.

56
00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.239
P4: All right. You know what I'm gonna

57
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.570
P4: Oh, share! You want to share.

58
00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:08.710
Hieu: Yes, please

59
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:15.840
Hieu: share, and then it should ask you for what to share, and it will be the screen with the prototype.

60
00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.219
P4: No! Is that it? No.

61
00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.899
Hieu: Yep, that's it. I see it.

62
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:20.800
P4: Okay. Cool.

63
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.530
Hieu: And then you can resize it or whatnot if you'd like to.

64
00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:34.129
Hieu: But that's it. Okay. So for this, let's start with the green option for the 1st

65
00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.550
Hieu: portion, and then you can scroll down.

66
00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:37.760
P4: Yeah, click on it.

67
00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:38.370
Hieu: Yeah.

68
00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.189
P4: Update your Va. Health benefits, information.

69
00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:53.599
Hieu: Yep, so please take a few moments to kind of go through this page, and I'd like you to think out loud as much as possible, noting anything that's confusing.

70
00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.230
Hieu: Oh, I'm sorry, can we?

71
00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:09.625
Hieu: I've

72
00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:16.179
Hieu: I pointed you to the wrong one. Can you go back if you scroll down here.

73
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.490
Hieu: Can you go press a back scroll up a little bit.

74
00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:26.740
Hieu: I meant to bring each the red 1 first.st That is my mistake. Right there at the back button.

75
00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:27.580
Hieu: Yeah.

76
00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.000
P4: So you want me to go back.

77
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.949
Hieu: Yes, please. So scroll down, you'll see at the bottom of the page.

78
00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:33.420
P4: Oh, yeah.

79
00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:36.300
Hieu: Yeah, there, you go.

80
00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:36.940
P4: Okay.

81
00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.739
Hieu: And and then can you scroll down? There is also.

82
00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:41.450
P4: Option, red.

83
00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.610
Hieu: And yep, that is correct.

84
00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.240
P4: Okay? Is this good?

85
00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.620
Hieu: Yup, that is good. Thank you.

86
00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:47.909
P4: Want me to read this.

87
00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:59.650
Hieu: And then you can read out loud, and then kind of think out loud, and then go through the process like, if you're doing this for real? What are you thinking? What's your whole? What's on your mind?

88
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:07.380
P4: yeah, I mean, do you want me to correct anything? Do you want me to give you my opinion on things.

89
00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:22.850
Hieu: That is correct. You are giving your opinion. You're not correcting anything. The whole point of this is that you're trying to update your financial information, and you're confirming that your information is correct here. In this case, in this scenario, you're Riley Smith.

90
00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:24.110
P4: Okay.

91
00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:42.090
P4: okay. Right. Now, it just seems like, this is a information page for me.

92
00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:46.770
P4: It doesn't really ask me to take any real action.

93
00:07:47.594 --> 00:07:51.940
P4: I'm waiting what to do next, or I'm looking what to do next.

94
00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.350
P4: So.

95
00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:57.000
Hieu: Okay, so.

96
00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.210
P4: Can you continue?

97
00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:00.660
Hieu: Yep, that is correct.

98
00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:04.760
P4: Update your Va. Health benefits information.

99
00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:09.840
P4: We'll save your application on every change. Your application. Id. Is this.

100
00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:16.350
P4: Hmm. I like, I can. I like that. I can edit my mailing address right away.

101
00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.460
P4: because I can look and see.

102
00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:21.390
P4: You know, if I moved, or whatever right

103
00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:24.980
P4: my home address should be the same right?

104
00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:26.550
P4: Your home address.

105
00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:30.820
P4: I'm not a techno person, but

106
00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:34.720
P4: there's there's 2 different addresses for me here.

107
00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:47.680
P4: and I can edit each. Usually your home address is your mailing address. So if the tech people said, you know, for an example, to make it easier, you can kind of do away with that home address.

108
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:54.559
P4: The mailing address and home address should be one in the same. If it's not, then you could give me the choice to edit

109
00:08:55.281 --> 00:08:56.769
P4: but if it is

110
00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:05.550
P4: then I should have a just click on a box to say that I can say that so.

111
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:08.660
Hieu: Right. So you like an option to kind of make that simpler.

112
00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:19.750
P4: Yeah, I mean, yeah. And and it's just a simple question, is your home address and mail and address the same? Just click here this way. I'm not this way. I'm not looking at both. Just one

113
00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:22.779
P4: one small question, a phone and mail

114
00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:27.240
P4: an email address. I like the fact that I can edit this. And look at this.

115
00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:34.169
P4: All veterans are not really a computer savvy? Especially the older veterans. The

116
00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:41.199
P4: they're not necessarily computer savvy. So you want to make it as easy as possible. My recommendation.

117
00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:41.750
Hieu: Right.

118
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:44.590
P4: Is this your current contact information?

119
00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:52.459
P4: Yeah, that's a little redundant. Because what else is there besides your home address, mail address.

120
00:09:52.600 --> 00:10:05.049
P4: your phone and email. If you've already edit all that you can kind of do away, it's kind of redundant. Is this your current contact information? I just edited all my contact information. So just something.

121
00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:07.149
Hieu: That question is redundant.

122
00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:14.030
P4: Well, I think so, because you're already asking me. You're giving me the options to edit all my information.

123
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:14.420
Hieu: Right.

124
00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:18.230
P4: Then you're saying, is this current contact information.

125
00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:19.120
Hieu: Okay.

126
00:10:19.355 --> 00:10:25.250
P4: Well, you just gave me the option to edit. If I don't need to edit, then it's current. It's just kind of redundant, that's all.

127
00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:26.409
Hieu: I gotcha.

128
00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:27.840
P4: I just my opinion. Yeah.

129
00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.230
Hieu: Right? Right that makes sense.

130
00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:31.109
P4: Yeah, I mean, the less you can put up.

131
00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:42.060
P4: I would think would be better, because you're dealing with the whole entire Va population from the younger vets to the older vets that aren't savvy at all in the computer.

132
00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:47.610
P4: you know, they they may not even have a computer. Some people are on their phones doing this, and

133
00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:52.220
P4: we saved your request. I like that. Okay, just continue.

134
00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:53.240
Hieu: Yes, please.

135
00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:57.250
P4: Okay, update your Va. Health benefits.

136
00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:01.460
P4: household financial information. We'll see again.

137
00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:07.290
P4: We'll be some of your information from your account. If you need to correct anything.

138
00:11:07.851 --> 00:11:17.200
P4: I'm a little bit. Why do they want my financial information? That's my 1st question. Why, why do you want that? And why do you want it on the Internet.

139
00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:22.229
P4: you know. I mean, that's my. It's kind of a little bit evasive. It's kind of personal.

140
00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:29.310
P4: What does my household financial information have to do with my healthcare benefits. My healthcare benefits

141
00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:40.339
P4: are based upon my service-connected disabilities. So why do you want to know my financial information? That's my 1st question.

142
00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:41.030
Hieu: Gotcha.

143
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:44.950
P4: I'm kind of reluctant to give you that, because it's it's really irrelevant.

144
00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:51.940
P4: You don't really need to know my financial information. Marital status, I can understand.

145
00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:56.910
P4: It's you know.

146
00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:02.449
P4: I don't have a problem telling you if I'm married or not. But you know, why is that really required.

147
00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:03.600
Hieu: Right.

148
00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:04.180
P4: So that's.

149
00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:05.390
Hieu: Where you're questioning it.

150
00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:06.840
P4: I'll continue.

151
00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:07.740
Hieu: Yes, please.

152
00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:12.730
P4: Okay, update your healthcare benefits information. Now, this is the 3rd screen.

153
00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:17.869
P4: This is the 3rd 3rd screen that we're kind of looking at all this stuff.

154
00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:26.739
P4: I mean, it'd be nice if you could lessen those 3 screens. I know it's a lot of information you're asking, but most of it's just to update information.

155
00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:33.340
P4: So maybe if you had a larger page, you could combine all 3 of these, 1, 2, and 3.

156
00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:38.250
Hieu: You just gave me a larger page with all this, because now I'm going.

157
00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:43.829
P4: I'm going to the 3rd page. Just the thought, it's just this is all about ease. This is all about

158
00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:48.090
P4: anyways, we'll save your application on every change.

159
00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:53.669
P4: This is repeated constantly. This is repeated on every page. That one statement

160
00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:57.529
P4: make any needed edits, then select. Continue

161
00:12:57.950 --> 00:13:01.979
P4: married. Well, I just told you I was married or not. Isn't that redundant

162
00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:06.529
P4: on on page 2 you just asked me if I was married. Now you're.

163
00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:06.950
Hieu: Right.

164
00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:08.160
P4: I should edit it

165
00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:22.760
P4: whether I'm married or not, or you're giving me the. You're giving me the option to edit it. But on number 2 on page 2 you just asked me that should be sufficient. Why are you at? Why are you telling me.

166
00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.169
Hieu: Asking this, a similar.

167
00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:24.600
P4: Again.

168
00:13:24.936 --> 00:13:25.610
Hieu: Information? Yeah.

169
00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:28.569
P4: I mean, this is common sense stuff. This is simple stuff.

170
00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:38.140
P4: we saved your requests. That's kind of I mean, each and every page you're doing that. Combine all this in one page.

171
00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:41.960
P4: Don't do 3 page. It's just kind of confusing, you know. And right.

172
00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:45.650
P4: it's just it's really time consuming people who want to.

173
00:13:45.830 --> 00:14:01.230
P4: People want information from the Va, they just want easy access. The technology is there. So don't make this harder than it needs than it needs to be. Put it all on one page. If you ask me if I'm married, and I tell you that I'm married, then don't give me. The

174
00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:05.189
P4: don't give me the edit unless you want to know if I got divorced.

175
00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:11.580
P4: Okay, update your update, your Va. Health benefits.

176
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:17.000
P4: household financial information again. Why? Why do I need to give that to you?

177
00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:18.170
Hieu: Right.

178
00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:24.760
P4: Your dependents, who will we who we consider a dependent? There's a drop down box.

179
00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:27.920
P4: which is nice spouse, unmarried child.

180
00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:37.550
P4: We saved your request again.

181
00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:39.630
Hieu: Don't like that. Redundancy.

182
00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:42.739
P4: Yeah, a lot of this, and you see, need help. All of this is there.

183
00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:49.569
P4: And and I know you're trying to get the message out. But put it all on one page. Guys, right? It's faster.

184
00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:50.190
Hieu: Right.

185
00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:53.380
P4: You're asking for the same things over and over and over.

186
00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:58.689
P4: I'm just telling you as a consumer kind of as a.

187
00:14:58.690 --> 00:14:59.080
Hieu: Right.

188
00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:00.310
P4: Been looking in.

189
00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:03.580
P4: This is what I see. As you said, there's no right or wrong answers. You could totally.

190
00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:04.120
Hieu: Is correct.

191
00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:05.510
P4: With me, but I'm just

192
00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:11.640
P4: kind of looking at it, you know. I've been clicking and clicking and clicking, and now I know that I'm still on page 2,

193
00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:13.730
P4: you know.

194
00:15:15.088 --> 00:15:18.839
P4: So here's my dependence. I can edit that.

195
00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:36.620
P4: What does my dependent go away? Why am I editing my dependent? Does my dependent go away? Well, according to the Va. It goes away after a dependent reaches a certain age for Va. Benefits, so I can kind of understand that. But

196
00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.549
P4: then you give me a delete button.

197
00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:43.710
P4: Am I going to delete my dependent? That's a little strange. There.

198
00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:45.430
Hieu: It's a little awkward for you. There.

199
00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:50.779
P4: I think so. I mean, what do you edit my dependent? Why am I going to edit him?

200
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.935
P4: Michael Scott Smith?

201
00:15:55.290 --> 00:16:00.080
P4: Do you have any other dependents. Okay? No, I don't want to add another dependent.

202
00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:04.490
P4: Yes, I want to add another dependent. Okay.

203
00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:12.549
P4: update your Va health benefits, information. Same stuff. Man. Put all this on one page.

204
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:17.190
P4: A lot of a lot of this page is all of this.

205
00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:19.379
P4: A lot of these little

206
00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:34.219
P4: arrows gives the same information. It's so redundant. It's kind of confusing. And it takes a little time to see. Okay, what? What is this? It's the same stuff you've been saying every single page, and I know it's useful. I'm not saying that

207
00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:41.890
P4: I'm just saying that if you put all this on one long page, then I wouldn't have to click back and forth and continue.

208
00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:44.269
Hieu: You'd rather have it like one long page instead.

209
00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:57.440
P4: I mean, wouldn't you? Why do you want to continue? Continue after a while? People get frustrated? Well, how their thinking is? And my thinking is, how much longer is this going to take? I'm still on number 2.

210
00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:58.290
Hieu: Right.

211
00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:06.939
P4: And it's only really simple questions. But you're repeating all the other useful information. So household financial information.

212
00:17:07.369 --> 00:17:10.360
P4: Do you have income and deductible expenses to add.

213
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.200
P4: I don't know why I'm filling this out.

214
00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:18.190
P4: This has nothing to do with the Va.

215
00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:24.389
P4: My personal financial or household information. I'm not applying for a loan with the Va.

216
00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:31.790
P4: Why do I need to answer these? That's my 1st question. I am reluctant to say Yes, no, maybe, or give any numbers.

217
00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:37.049
P4: I'm going to continue household financial information again.

218
00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:39.090
P4: Gross income from work.

219
00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:41.260
P4: Why do we need to know that.

220
00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:52.810
Hieu: And then I'm going to stop you right there. So for this scenario, you and your spouse's work and salary has not changed from 2,023 to 2,024,

221
00:17:53.050 --> 00:18:21.599
Hieu: and then for this scenario I would be giving you like a list that you would have on for your own information, like your W. 2, your tax information or or kind of your expenses that you would keep, maybe for someone like you. It's not unlikely that you'll be using this due to your disability rating. But perhaps someone that's with a disability rating that's lower. They might have to do this.

222
00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:28.500
P4: Yeah, I have never been asked my financial information at all, ever.

223
00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:34.400
P4: ever so for me to do this as a veteran. 1st time. Looking at this.

224
00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:36.810
P4: I want to know. Why are you asking that?

225
00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:42.659
P4: I've never been asked for my any financial and information. Very invasive, I think.

226
00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:52.970
P4: And then you're asking me to find out what my gross annual income is. I got to stop right now, if I want to be 100% honest with these questions, and I got to go find that out.

227
00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:57.690
P4: I had to take time and step away from this. And then

228
00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:21.089
P4: either go into my computer, go into my files. And at this time the frustration level is going to build. I mean, why are they asking this for me? What do they mean? Gross income, I mean, I know what it means, but the average veteran. And then I'm going to enter my gross income. There's no you're telling me, and you're asking me what to do. But you're not telling me why you need this information.

229
00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:25.500
P4: You're not telling me that you need this information for X

230
00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:33.630
P4: or for X. You just want this financial information, and I'm reluctant to do. I would probably stop right now.

231
00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:38.710
P4: Okay, I would. I would, probably because I don't know the answers to all this.

232
00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:39.640
Hieu: I don't know.

233
00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:40.959
P4: Why you want this.

234
00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:46.979
P4: so I would I would stop. I would probably call the Va. And say, What, why do you want this.

235
00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:52.560
Hieu: Okay. So in your case, you would stop filling this out and then contact the Va.

236
00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:56.959
P4: Right. Do you see anything on this telling me why you want this information?

237
00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:17.559
Hieu: So in this scenario it's a little bit different. Because if if this is for real, you do have like a introduction page. That explains some of this information you just ask. But for our purposes with for this scenario, you would pass that already. So you're into the

238
00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:20.000
Hieu: filling. This information out form.

239
00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:28.169
P4: Right. So what is that scenario? Maybe I missed it. What's that scenario stating? You want my information.

240
00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:31.889
Hieu: So this one might not pertain to you because of your disability.

241
00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:32.750
P4: Oh, gotcha! Okay.

242
00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:38.659
Hieu: For a lower disability, rating for a copay, and reimbursements for.

243
00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:39.200
P4: Oh, I see!

244
00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:40.000
Hieu: Yeah.

245
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.309
P4: Yes, yeah. And that's what I thought to Copay. But

246
00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:48.249
P4: if I'm going to be honest with you, it's it's a little bit invasive, because.

247
00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:48.770
Hieu: Great.

248
00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:55.129
P4: You know, we're on the Internet. I know we're in a secure, but I mean, who wants to give information like yours?

249
00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:57.199
P4: You know what I mean. I mean, it's just.

250
00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:08.449
Hieu: Right right that makes sense. And then, if you were to do this for real, this is where you mentioned that you stop and you have to gather this information. So that's where your frustration would be.

251
00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:11.149
P4: Yeah, I mean, wouldn't you? I mean, I don't know.

252
00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:22.320
P4: I don't know. If you know all this information offhand. I mean, you would have to go and look at it. So it's gonna be more time. It's gonna be more time consuming. I have a general

253
00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:26.100
P4: idea what the amounts are, but.

254
00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:33.509
Hieu: And then may I ask if you were to do this for real? And you had to fill out other information? How long would that take you.

255
00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:34.860
P4: Oh, this stuff! Here!

256
00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:35.620
Hieu: Yeah.

257
00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:45.689
P4: Yeah, it's gonna take I mean, I could. I could estimate it. But you wanna you guys want as as exact as possible, it could take

258
00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:49.940
P4: it could take 1015 min to

259
00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:52.980
P4: to an hour. If you gotta go locate this stuff.

260
00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:53.360
Hieu: Right.

261
00:21:53.360 --> 00:22:00.150
P4: Do all veterans? Are they organized? Do they have all this information available?

262
00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:07.519
P4: I mean, just it does not prepare you to give this information until you hit this screen.

263
00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:13.659
Hieu: Gotcha kind of keep that in mind. You know what I mean. You're gonna be asking for this. You want them to fill it out right away.

264
00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:16.770
P4: You got to prompt me before this.

265
00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:18.139
Hieu: Right, you know.

266
00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:28.149
P4: We're going to need your financial information because of this, this, this and this, please be prepared to provide that those amounts

267
00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:29.759
P4: I don't know just.

268
00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:30.490
Hieu: Okay.

269
00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:33.120
P4: I'm not trying to.

270
00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:35.860
Hieu: Nope, that makes sense to me.

271
00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:38.450
P4: Yeah, I'm not okay. I'm I'm gonna continue.

272
00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:45.979
Hieu: So for this one you actually had to fill out. But in your case you can just click the boxes and they'll do an auto fill out.

273
00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:49.960
Hieu: It's it's a demo. So if you click on the

274
00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:57.170
Hieu: yeah, just click there and it'll fill out the the information for you, is it not responding.

275
00:22:57.170 --> 00:22:58.529
P4: Nice. Okay.

276
00:22:58.530 --> 00:22:59.300
Hieu: Okay. It is.

277
00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:06.569
P4: So you're saying, if I put in like in that example, my spouse's gross income, it will automatically fill out.

278
00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:10.589
P4: It'll automatically fill this out.

279
00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:20.010
Hieu: Well for this demo. Yes, but in a real in reality. No, you'll have to find that. You have to find out the

280
00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:21.649
Hieu: kind of the numbers.

281
00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:25.559
P4: Right. Okay, I just want to reiterate to you

282
00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:29.450
P4: that when you're dealing with veterans

283
00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:33.010
P4: they're going to be very young to very, very old.

284
00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:38.100
P4: and the less that they have to do the better results. You'll get

285
00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:43.410
P4: some of these veterans. They don't have a computer or they're not computer savvy.

286
00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:58.500
P4: And you want to make this an easy process, right? Right? You want to make it fast, and you want to make it very easy for them to do large letters, colors, things like that.

287
00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:01.749
P4: Just a just a recommendation.

288
00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:10.940
P4: See, I'm still on number 2 deductible expenses.

289
00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:16.040
P4: This is lengthy, guys. This is lengthy. Why are we doing all of this?

290
00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:18.270
P4: That's what I'm thinking in my mind.

291
00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:21.559
P4: You know, I'm still on Number 2 here.

292
00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:28.540
P4: Household financial information. Make any needed edits to your information. Then select, continue.

293
00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:36.520
P4: Okay, I can look at this. This is pretty easy to do. But and I can edit, okay.

294
00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:41.360
P4: okay? And then, can you stop right there on that screen?

295
00:24:41.957 --> 00:24:46.119
P4: The the last point I want to say is, I don't know how many clicks.

296
00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:51.500
P4: I don't know if it was 1015, but.

297
00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:53.170
Hieu: You for have less.

298
00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:57.110
P4: I mean, wouldn't you? I mean, it would be easier

299
00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:01.979
P4: if you can do it all on one or 2 pages, because you're repeating a lot of the same info. But go ahead.

300
00:25:02.767 --> 00:25:07.680
Hieu: So yeah, actually expand on that. Was there any part that was confusing to you?

301
00:25:08.945 --> 00:25:14.414
P4: Not really confusing? Because I I'm more computer savvy, you know. But

302
00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:19.869
P4: why? Why do you want all my financial information.

303
00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:20.560
Hieu: I.

304
00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:27.830
P4: Understand about updating my my personal info, and you've given me examples on how to do that.

305
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.670
P4: But it's kind of redundant because you're

306
00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:37.609
P4: you're asking some of the same information on the very next page. I don't like the fact that I have to keep on.

307
00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:46.689
P4: Arrowing to the next page arrowing to the next page, and 2 thirds of that page is the same information.

308
00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:50.320
P4: When you can just bullet questions

309
00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:56.500
P4: right? You can just bullet questions and do all this in one or 2 pages, but I know I keep saying that. Go ahead.

310
00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:13.099
Hieu: And then for the financial portion of it on a scale of one to 5, 1 being very easy, 5 being very hard. How difficult was it for you to kind of complete the financial information? If you were to do this with real information.

311
00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:25.249
P4: the physical ease of it. I can. I can click on blocks, you know. I can down arrows and right and left.

312
00:26:26.050 --> 00:26:33.210
P4: but I still have that reason why you never request my my my finances, so I have doubt there.

313
00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:36.369
P4: So the ease of it is is

314
00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:41.540
P4: the ease it it's easy. I don't know if I can give you.

315
00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:43.640
Hieu: Right? So technically, it's easy.

316
00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:44.889
P4: Yeah, the reasoning.

317
00:26:44.890 --> 00:26:49.260
P4: It's easy. I have confusion on why you want the information.

318
00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:54.569
P4: And you're putting all your your.

319
00:26:55.890 --> 00:27:03.270
P4: You're having me to work, work, work, work for this. You're having me to go to one screen, to the next, to the next, to the next, to the next.

320
00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:11.139
P4: Again I've repeated myself. Put everything on one screen or 2 screens

321
00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:19.610
P4: right? And just say all that general information. Once you don't have to keep repeating it. It's not that's not going to change.

322
00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:22.200
P4: you know. If I if I look to.

323
00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:34.469
P4: for example, if I go and I look for need help, you don't need to say that on every single screen. You've already told me that if I need help I can go there. It's just going to save time.

324
00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:52.479
P4: And you know people get aggravated, people get aggravated as time goes on. Oh, damn! I got to go to another screen. When's this going to stop? I mean, what else do they need? I don't understand this. I got to go and get my information. I got to go and get my numbers. I got to find out how much my taxes were, and

325
00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:55.379
P4: why do they need this? You know? On and on and on these thoughts.

326
00:27:55.380 --> 00:28:10.430
Hieu: Okay, right? And then so on a writing scale. Then for the technical aspect of it, you would rate it pretty easy. But in terms of the mental portion of it or the frustration portion of it. It's a lot lower, essentially.

327
00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:13.120
P4: Right. I mean, it's not E. It's

328
00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:17.290
P4: it's it's easy to do technically, but it's a

329
00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:22.210
P4: it's a hard. It's hard to do when when I have to move on.

330
00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:22.940
Hieu: Right.

331
00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:25.019
P4: To screen, to screen, to screen.

332
00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:32.750
Hieu: So would you? Do you have a number for that? Then would it be like, let's say a 2 or a 3 instead of a 1?

333
00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:35.759
P4: For for what the ease.

334
00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:36.470
Hieu: Yeah.

335
00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:42.240
P4: Well, technically, it's easy to do so, whatever that number is. The high number 2, 3, whatever it is.

336
00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:46.890
Hieu: Like. Technically, one is the easiest. And then if you're saying Okay, you.

337
00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:48.090
P4: One is the easiest.

338
00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:48.470
Hieu: Yeah.

339
00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:50.289
P4: Is the easiest. Yes.

340
00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:57.169
Hieu: Okay, so, but that's like you mentioned. It's more of the technical aspect of it, but not the reasoning.

341
00:28:58.020 --> 00:28:59.320
P4: Right? Okay.

342
00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:00.339
Hieu: That makes sense.

343
00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:02.700
P4: Yeah, I mean, it's easy to do.

344
00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:09.290
P4: But then, again, I'm I'm more computer savvy than the average. Or maybe the an older vet.

345
00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:10.420
Hieu: Right.

346
00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:13.479
P4: I mean the whole entire objection.

347
00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:20.930
P4: Objection. The whole entire purpose I'm assuming is to get is to put this out

348
00:29:21.170 --> 00:29:26.040
P4: for ease of use, you know. Get all the information that you required

349
00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:32.230
P4: in the shortest amount of time in in the ease of use, you know, and you have to give me arrows, that if I

350
00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:38.259
P4: you have to give me ways that if I put in the wrong information I can always go back and correct it.

351
00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:47.050
P4: You know, if I'm typing in a 7 and it should be a 3, you've got to give me ways to do that. I think you do. But that's just a suggestion.

352
00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:55.679
Hieu: Okay, yeah. And then we can jump back to the screen here. So for this screen this is the review screen here. And then

353
00:29:55.910 --> 00:30:00.220
Hieu: you can continue on kind of reading out loud, or thinking out loud.

354
00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:10.380
P4: Veteran information I'm assuming. If I click on that it'll give me my information

355
00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:13.400
P4: if I click on veteran information.

356
00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:14.709
Hieu: Go ahead and try that.

357
00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:18.670
P4: Yeah, okay.

358
00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:26.820
P4: I mean, I mean, that's great. But I've already given you this information.

359
00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:28.080
Hieu: Okay, so.

360
00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:32.830
P4: Right, I mean, haven't I already given in? You've asked me to edit it several times.

361
00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:39.640
P4: So I mean, that's that's we we've already. This is. This is redundant, because I've already

362
00:30:39.770 --> 00:30:44.470
P4: edited any information I was going to edit. I've already answered all your questions.

363
00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:47.130
P4: and now you're asking me to edit it again.

364
00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:53.639
P4: Why, why is that necessary it once, if I was gonna edit it.

365
00:30:54.680 --> 00:31:06.079
Hieu: So in your case, would you want this screen to be basically the only screens you mentioned earlier of asking this question one time, and you only want, like one long screen, to scroll through.

366
00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:07.799
P4: Yeah, I mean.

367
00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:19.519
P4: I would think so, because don't you think this is redundant? I've already edited my mailing address, my home address. I've already told you if I was married. I've already told you if I had dependents.

368
00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:23.289
P4: So now you're asking me again for that same information.

369
00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:28.840
P4: Why are you doing that. It's this is redundant, right?

370
00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:38.580
P4: Yep, I mean. And sooner or later the reader, the veteran, is going to get a little bit, man. Why are they asking me for the same information I already edited, that

371
00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:40.570
P4: that's some of the thinking.

372
00:31:41.530 --> 00:31:47.170
P4: By submitting this form. You agree. See, you'll pay any va copays. Okay.

373
00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:53.619
P4: There's the Privacy act. Read more about the assignment of benefits.

374
00:31:54.050 --> 00:31:57.369
P4: Wow! This is long, this is long.

375
00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:04.289
P4: This is this, is this is long, and there we go. We have that same information.

376
00:32:05.030 --> 00:32:09.160
P4: You know. I'm not knocking the person that did this or people that do this, but

377
00:32:09.910 --> 00:32:13.530
P4: sometimes you gotta step into the shoes of the reader.

378
00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:18.850
P4: I mean hell. Would you like to go through all this? Don't you have better things to do than do all this?

379
00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:24.060
P4: You know people are skeptical of the Va. To begin with, you know.

380
00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:25.600
P4: Make it easy.

381
00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:33.839
P4: Make it really really easy. Don't keep asking me the same thing over and over and over. What purpose does that solve? And and you give me the options to edit?

382
00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:38.290
P4: Okay, so I've edited it. So now we're way way back here.

383
00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:42.309
P4: and you're asking me to edit my mailing address again.

384
00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:44.820
P4: Anyways, that's it. That's that's.

385
00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:45.200
Hieu: Okay.

386
00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:47.980
P4: Because of my no, that's that's good feedback.

387
00:32:48.110 --> 00:33:00.649
Hieu: For, and then on a scale of one to 5. Then for the whole form, you know, 5, 1 being very easy and 5 being very hard. How difficult would you rate this kind of the overall form.

388
00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:03.870
P4: I would say maybe a 4.

389
00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:04.940
Hieu: Okay.

390
00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:09.040
P4: You know you? Yeah, yeah, I would say, overall 4. I don't.

391
00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:13.509
Hieu: Leaning on the hard on the hard side of things.

392
00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:15.380
P4: Yeah.

393
00:33:16.051 --> 00:33:20.370
Hieu: I mean, this is simple information. This is personal information.

394
00:33:21.370 --> 00:33:24.310
P4: It's it's so. It's really really simple.

395
00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:30.719
P4: Ask it once give me the options to edit, and then that's it. Don't keep asking me every single

396
00:33:30.850 --> 00:33:37.910
P4: a page, and what makes it even more difficult is you are asking me for financial information

397
00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:45.820
P4: that if most people, most veterans don't have that readily available. So now I got to stop.

398
00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:52.820
P4: And I have to leave the computer screen. And I have to go find that information. And I know I said this before.

399
00:33:53.370 --> 00:33:58.789
P4: so prepare me if you can prepare me or prompt me.

400
00:33:59.973 --> 00:34:03.840
P4: That you're going to ask this information, then.

401
00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:12.489
P4: maybe I have time to react, because right now I most people would have to stop and go and get that information.

402
00:34:12.659 --> 00:34:13.549
Hieu: Right

403
00:34:13.979 --> 00:34:21.459
Hieu: and then on a efficiency scale, then for one to 5, 1 being very efficient and 5 being very inefficient.

404
00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:21.960
P4: Yeah, for.

405
00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:23.380
Hieu: How would you rate that over? Okay.

406
00:34:23.389 --> 00:34:26.569
P4: Yeah, yeah, because you keep on. Yeah, you keep on

407
00:34:28.249 --> 00:34:31.349
P4: What you're doing is you're you are

408
00:34:34.039 --> 00:34:38.939
P4: and I know I've said this so many times, you are repeating the same.

409
00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:40.840
Hieu: It's the same information. Basically.

410
00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:51.750
P4: Yeah, I mean, don't you see that? I mean, it's pretty obvious you are. And even though I give you the answers, you're still asking me the same questions. And do I want to delete it?

411
00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:55.610
P4: Man, make this simple. Do it once

412
00:34:56.330 --> 00:34:59.500
P4: right? I mean that that would make sense to me.

413
00:34:59.870 --> 00:35:09.359
P4: you know. Ask me what you need to ask me. Give me the options to to make changes. If there's no changes, there's no changes, then then we move on

414
00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:10.640
P4: right? Okay.

415
00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:11.130
Hieu: Hey!

416
00:35:11.130 --> 00:35:23.260
P4: I mean, you can do it and do it in less screens, right? Do it in one or 2 screens need help. Same thing. You don't need to keep repeating all that. Just a thought. I could be totally off base, but just.

417
00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:27.570
Hieu: Yeah, thank you for your feedback for that. And then can you scroll down to the bottom.

418
00:35:27.570 --> 00:35:28.060
P4: Yeah. Sorry.

419
00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:37.029
Hieu: For this one. We'll end the the 1st demo here, so there's not this complete bottom, but if you scroll up a little bit you'll see at the end. Demo button

420
00:35:38.170 --> 00:35:40.219
Hieu: a little bit more. Yeah, there you go.

421
00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:40.900
P4: Every. Yeah.

422
00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:46.849
Hieu: And Demo. So that was the we just complete the red option. And now we're gonna

423
00:35:46.850 --> 00:35:47.549
Hieu: let me go to Green.

424
00:35:47.550 --> 00:36:06.099
Hieu: Yep, the green option in this option you'll see very similar screens, some of it the same, and some of it different. And then in your mind, you'll be kind of basically comparing it, and then kind of talk out loud as you're going through this again again, it's the same form, but it's just the information is

425
00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:07.900
Hieu: of present it differently.

426
00:36:08.830 --> 00:36:16.879
P4: Yeah, tell me something. Is this a continuation? Would I continue to this, or this green or red? Are they totally different formats.

427
00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:23.210
Hieu: So it's slightly different format. And we're curious on your feedback for both of them, like one way or another.

428
00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:26.949
P4: I see. Okay. So what I'm reading now has nothing to do with the other one.

429
00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:30.679
P4: This is, I'm going to base my opinion on what I'm seeing now.

430
00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:31.730
Hieu: So you're.

431
00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:32.740
P4: Saw the other one.

432
00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:34.660
Hieu: So you're comparing the 2 essentially.

433
00:36:34.890 --> 00:36:36.279
P4: Yep. Yep. Yep. Okay.

434
00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:37.050
Hieu: Go ahead!

435
00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:41.470
P4: Update your Va health benefits. Information. Okay.

436
00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:45.459
P4: we'll save your application to every change.

437
00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:48.780
P4: your app, your application. Id. Is that okay?

438
00:36:50.330 --> 00:36:53.369
P4: Review your information before you continue. Okay.

439
00:36:57.370 --> 00:36:58.659
P4: you know usually.

440
00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:00.870
P4: Well, no.

441
00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:08.380
P4: I mean in most pages that you log in

442
00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:12.959
P4: 2 or not most pages, but when you begin they'll they'll give you your

443
00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:18.120
P4: your disability total. You'll see it when you log in.

444
00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:27.729
P4: But I mean I haven't seen it on both of those. I don't know if that's needed or not. So if you need to update your personal information call.

445
00:37:28.050 --> 00:37:29.820
P4: isn't that interesting?

446
00:37:29.970 --> 00:37:36.370
P4: Do I need to update my personal information? But yet you're why are you saying that when you're giving me options to update it?

447
00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:37.940
P4: Huh?

448
00:37:38.050 --> 00:37:44.560
P4: Right? You're saying, if I need to update my personal information, call this right.

449
00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:51.050
P4: But yet you're giving me options in the same. You're you're asking questions to update my information a little bit.

450
00:37:51.050 --> 00:37:52.539
Hieu: Frustrating to you as well.

451
00:37:52.540 --> 00:38:03.100
P4: Well, it's a little bit confusing, and I know that I know playing the devil's advocate here. But you're telling me if I need to update my information. Call this number, and then in a couple

452
00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:07.410
P4: screens later, I know you're going to ask me to update my information.

453
00:38:07.830 --> 00:38:12.719
P4: So what am I going to do? Call the 800 number or update my information?

454
00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:18.300
P4: Yeah, you can also call your your Va healthcare to help changing your name.

455
00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:25.079
P4: Okay? But you're going to give me the option to do that and edit it. I know you are okay. So I'm going to continue anyways.

456
00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:25.810
Hieu: Okay.

457
00:38:25.810 --> 00:38:28.840
P4: Update your Va. Health benefits information.

458
00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:35.310
P4: Same thing. We saved your application. That's the same. We pre-filled some of your information from your account.

459
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.040
P4: Okay.

460
00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:42.410
P4: Mailing address.

461
00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:44.470
P4: Okay,

462
00:38:52.410 --> 00:38:56.909
P4: Is your home address, the same as your mailing address. Yes or no. Okay.

463
00:38:57.320 --> 00:38:59.170
P4: Finish this form later.

464
00:38:59.490 --> 00:39:00.510
P4: Okay.

465
00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:08.260
P4: alright, does that mean? Can I go back in? How do I go back in? How do I finish the form?

466
00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:10.449
P4: I'm sure if I click on that

467
00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:14.810
Hieu: For this demo. It doesn't do anything.

468
00:39:14.810 --> 00:39:15.819
Hieu: It doesn't. Okay.

469
00:39:16.145 --> 00:39:16.470
Hieu: Yeah.

470
00:39:16.690 --> 00:39:22.120
P4: You're telling me that. Finish it later. Those are the questions that I would be asking

471
00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:26.750
P4: again. We get the same kind of redundant information above there.

472
00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:34.180
P4: Finish this form later. Kind of the same information.

473
00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:37.110
P4: Yeah.

474
00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:44.540
P4: I'm looking at this again. So that means every single time that you do this. I have to read this again.

475
00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:46.210
P4: right?

476
00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:50.990
P4: And it kind of just gets a little it. Here's my phone and email.

477
00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:57.599
P4: But you know what on this form. You don't give me a you don't give me anything to edit

478
00:39:57.750 --> 00:40:04.099
P4: unless I know to click on the home phone number box or the mobile or my email.

479
00:40:04.250 --> 00:40:06.869
P4: It doesn't give me that function to edit

480
00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:12.209
P4: man. We'd be saving the Va. So much time, energy, and money if

481
00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:17.310
P4: the veteran could edit things themselves right if they know how to do that.

482
00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:20.360
P4: I'm the same.

483
00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:21.380
Hieu: Stop you right there.

484
00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:21.980
P4: Yeah.

485
00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:32.000
Hieu: And then do you prefer this one where it's page to page? Or do you prefer the previous option? Where is the kind of the overview and with the edit buttons.

486
00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:47.140
P4: Yeah, of course. Yes, yes, with the edit buttons. If you could. If you could shorten this down to one or 2 pages, I mean full screen pages, too. I don't want to look at a column. You're dealing with older vets, you know.

487
00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:52.479
P4: full screen pages and just state the the

488
00:40:53.136 --> 00:41:02.180
P4: the redundant information that you're doing for every single page? Because I'm basically answering one or 2 questions here.

489
00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:09.369
P4: Right? That's all the space that I have for can you imagine if you just set it up one or 2 pages where you had just

490
00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:12.500
P4: that same information need help.

491
00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:21.279
P4: you know. Update your Va health benefits. You're repeating it over and over and over. It's wasted space. It's wasted print.

492
00:41:21.490 --> 00:41:22.010
P4: I.

493
00:41:22.010 --> 00:41:34.000
Hieu: Want to clarify 2 things. So if this is the real form, you can technically edit those numbers directly in here. But then you would just click on the field.

494
00:41:34.684 --> 00:41:37.130
Hieu: This is a demo, so it's not clickable. Of course.

495
00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:40.980
P4: No. But how do you? Yeah, you know that. How does the reader know that

496
00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:51.649
P4: unless you tell me that I have the option to edit. I can try to double, click on for the phone or the or the email. Put an edit there. Allow me to do that. Allow me to edit.

497
00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:54.220
Hieu: So you want the edit on the the side here.

498
00:41:54.290 --> 00:42:00.120
P4: Whatever question you're asking me, I want it. Yeah, I want it below that edit

499
00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:04.389
P4: edit it give me the option to edit like on that 1st one

500
00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:12.209
P4: I mean, shouldn't you? Because I'm gonna double click it because I think I can change it because I I know a little bit about

501
00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:19.320
P4: technology. But here you give me no option to edit you kind of defeat versus. Can I continue.

502
00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:20.810
Hieu: Yep, you can continue.

503
00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:25.260
P4: I'm sorry I don't want to sound like sarcastic, and things like this.

504
00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:25.809
Hieu: No, we.

505
00:42:25.810 --> 00:42:34.079
P4: Trying to help. I'm trying to give you my honesty and trying to help bring about good change. You know what I mean, so that I mean, that's my whole goal.

506
00:42:36.310 --> 00:42:43.979
P4: Here we go with that household financial information. We previewed some information you're telling me that's required.

507
00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:51.170
P4: Right? I know this is for qualifying for certain programs or co-pays.

508
00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:56.850
P4: But people may not want to tell you if they're married and you're saying it's required.

509
00:42:57.470 --> 00:43:01.200
P4: So I finished the form later.

510
00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:09.819
P4: That's just one question about the marital status, and you're taking me to a toll. This is what I'm trying to tell you.

511
00:43:10.010 --> 00:43:13.779
P4: One question about the marital status, and you're taking me to a

512
00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:21.329
P4: a whole new page for it, and you're repeating the same old information. It's a wasteful.

513
00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:28.130
P4: Whoever design is, it's wasteful, and it's time consuming now, because now I got to continue

514
00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:38.799
P4: and my spouse's information my spouse's social security. Yeah,

515
00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:53.989
P4: the social security number is not going to change. My spouse's name may change, so you might want to edit that her date of birth is not going to change, but you might want to edit that because that could be wrong

516
00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:59.160
P4: date of marriage again, you want the data merits.

517
00:43:59.290 --> 00:44:01.769
P4: Some people don't know the date of their marriage

518
00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:04.429
P4: were dealing with young and old veterans.

519
00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:07.249
P4: so now they got to go and look it up. Well, the

520
00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:11.000
P4: you know the Va. Wants the date that I'm married.

521
00:44:11.370 --> 00:44:20.069
P4: I guess. Apparently that's important. So I'm going to go and look it up. I got to walk away from the screen. I think it's this date, but I don't know for sure. You know

522
00:44:20.340 --> 00:44:24.319
P4: I mean everybody knows when they're married, but as as time goes on, you know.

523
00:44:24.570 --> 00:44:25.300
Hieu: Right.

524
00:44:25.590 --> 00:44:27.290
P4: So now I got to continue

525
00:44:28.490 --> 00:44:32.009
P4: and update your Va healthcare benefits.

526
00:44:33.010 --> 00:44:39.620
P4: Do you live with your spouse? Do you currently have the same address as your spouse.

527
00:44:40.570 --> 00:44:46.819
P4: Okay, I'm continuing spouse's financial support.

528
00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:54.630
P4: Okay, did you provide financial support to your spouse?

529
00:44:56.313 --> 00:45:01.540
P4: Yes, no. I really don't want to give my financial information. As you know.

530
00:45:01.730 --> 00:45:04.509
P4: update your Va healthcare benefits again.

531
00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:12.219
P4: Well, we know that you. You've told us that every single page spouse's address and phone number.

532
00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:18.449
P4: Okay, something should be said that your spouse should have the same.

533
00:45:19.250 --> 00:45:23.209
P4: If your spouse's address is different from veteran.

534
00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:27.960
P4: you know, then give me this option.

535
00:45:28.540 --> 00:45:32.660
P4: You know that? That's what I'm thinking.

536
00:45:35.450 --> 00:45:37.340
P4: Review your dependents.

537
00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:47.210
P4: Do you have any other dependents? Your dependents? Edit edit.

538
00:45:48.310 --> 00:45:52.039
P4: who we consider as a dependent? Let me just check that

539
00:45:52.190 --> 00:46:01.639
P4: because they're 18 or 23 years old. And I kind of knew this, anyways, guys. But for if I was to look at this for the 1st time.

540
00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:07.129
P4: because you want to be able to know if your if your dependent is over 24. Now, then.

541
00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:09.329
P4: it's irrelevant. You don't really.

542
00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:17.400
P4: as far as the Va. Is concerned, they're not your dependent as far as they're they're concerned. And you can read this

543
00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:18.800
P4: there.

544
00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:20.569
P4: I mean you.

545
00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:24.929
P4: You can kind of look up this information. It's going to take more time.

546
00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:31.000
P4: but you can do it. What what we consider dependent

547
00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:37.960
P4: and it gives the examples, and I kind of know that. Do you have another dependent.

548
00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:46.889
P4: yes or no? Another dependent, another dependent that the Va. Considers a dependent or another dependent

549
00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:52.909
P4: general dependent, a little bit confusing. Right? Do you have another dependent to report?

550
00:46:56.490 --> 00:47:02.769
P4: Report? I have other dependents. But do you mean with this criteria? Or do you mean

551
00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:05.400
P4: dependence in general?

552
00:47:05.770 --> 00:47:08.959
P4: So I just want to kind of say that little bit confusion there.

553
00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:17.960
P4: Here's that financial stuff again, you know. Gross income from work, gross income for work.

554
00:47:18.210 --> 00:47:25.240
P4: Why do you need that? Maybe a statement should be in order to qualify, or in order to

555
00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:36.489
P4: get information about your copay. We require the following financial information, give me the reason upfront. Why are you asking for this? I think it would put more veterans at ease

556
00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:42.780
P4: because you're asking for financial information. Why are you asking for it? Just give us a simple reason.

557
00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:45.550
Hieu: Can you? Can I stop you right there.

558
00:47:45.550 --> 00:47:46.280
P4: Yeah.

559
00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:53.179
Hieu: So would you prefer that information on this page, or before you, even before you even go to this form.

560
00:47:53.630 --> 00:48:20.070
P4: Oh, good, good question. Maybe you could do it in the beginning. You know, we're going to be asking you several financial questions. This is determining the amount of copay that you're going to pay, or this is going to determine this. Give me a reason why I'm giving you that financial information, Gotcha, just the state, and start telling me about my taxes and my gross income and my spouse's financial. I mean, why do you need to know all that. You never, never told me that

561
00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:31.570
P4: that that you're asking me for it. But you're not telling me why I'm going to give it to you if you tell me why in the beginning, in bold letters like update your Va.

562
00:48:31.930 --> 00:48:49.130
P4: then I'm going to be more reluctant to give that to you. It kind of takes the fear away. It kind of takes the defensiveness away. Because now I know I'm providing this information because you're going to determine my copay, or for whatever reason, give me a reason before you ask me the question.

563
00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:56.889
Hieu: I do want to say that you know you already know this, but because you're disability reading, you might not require to

564
00:48:57.210 --> 00:48:58.499
Hieu: to kind of

565
00:48:58.770 --> 00:49:08.100
Hieu: provide any of this. And then another one is that in the real website you do have an information page, that kind of lists, everything you just said.

566
00:49:08.530 --> 00:49:11.050
Hieu: Oh, okay, yeah, I don't see it here.

567
00:49:11.050 --> 00:49:14.390
Hieu: Right? Right? So this is just a demo that's already in the form.

568
00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:21.720
P4: Okay, yeah. Okay, gross income from from from work.

569
00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:30.869
Hieu: So this is the same thing as the previous scenario. It's just presented slightly differently.

570
00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:40.210
Hieu: But for you, like you mentioned, you're more reluctant to fill this out, and you're more likely to contact the Va. In this regard.

571
00:49:41.070 --> 00:49:47.000
P4: Yeah, I mean, I would rather not contact the Va, I mean, if this

572
00:49:47.530 --> 00:49:58.959
P4: in this format is really effective, then you shouldn't have to call the the Va. You know, because you're wasting the Va's time. You're wasting the veterans time, if you can get all this done

573
00:49:59.410 --> 00:50:04.980
P4: as as eases as easily as possible. Then I think that would be more

574
00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:08.930
Hieu: Right.

575
00:50:08.930 --> 00:50:11.590
P4: I just think that I think that's the whole purpose of you.

576
00:50:11.950 --> 00:50:17.540
P4: of your call, and here I am tearing it up, and I'm man I don't need to be. I'm just trying to help you.

577
00:50:17.770 --> 00:50:20.129
P4: Nope, go, you know, feel free to do it.

578
00:50:20.130 --> 00:50:32.409
P4: Yeah, if I'm designing this, I wanna you know this is valuable information, because this is may not. You know I'm just giving you another set of eyes, you know gross income again spouses gross income.

579
00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:36.219
P4: If I don't know this again, I'm going to have to go and get it.

580
00:50:36.410 --> 00:50:38.949
P4: I'm going to have to step away from the screen.

581
00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:48.710
P4: you know. A quick sentence is, you're going to need to know your financial. We're going to be requesting your financial information. If you could please have

582
00:50:49.852 --> 00:50:52.290
P4: the following available

583
00:50:53.050 --> 00:50:57.389
P4: right this way. I can. You know this way. I I kind of know what I what I need to get.

584
00:50:57.740 --> 00:50:58.999
Hieu: That makes sense to me.

585
00:50:59.926 --> 00:51:08.099
P4: College. Okay, yeah, this is lengthy guys. Wow, this is really lengthy college of vocational education.

586
00:51:08.430 --> 00:51:11.839
P4: More information that I need to to kind of find out.

587
00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:20.979
Hieu: I'll stop you right there in terms of comparing this to the last kind of financial information portion. How would you kind of compare the 2.

588
00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:23.070
Hieu: It feels about the same to you.

589
00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:32.820
P4: yeah. The only real big difference is one you're you're you're giving me the ability to edit and the other one. You're not.

590
00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:33.950
Hieu: Okay.

591
00:51:33.950 --> 00:51:36.130
P4: They're both very, very lengthy.

592
00:51:36.290 --> 00:51:36.900
Hieu: Yeah.

593
00:51:37.030 --> 00:51:43.620
P4: They're lengthy because you're having me to go from screen to screen to screen to screen. And I know I've been repetitive saying that

594
00:51:44.050 --> 00:51:45.140
P4: right? I mean.

595
00:51:45.140 --> 00:51:45.810
Hieu: Right.

596
00:51:46.170 --> 00:51:47.410
P4: You are you, you.

597
00:51:47.410 --> 00:51:51.210
Hieu: And then can you move? Continue the next one. Then.

598
00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:53.440
P4: To the next.

599
00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:53.990
Hieu: Mitch.

600
00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:54.410
P4: Continue.

601
00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:55.850
Hieu: Yes, please

602
00:51:59.220 --> 00:52:03.199
Hieu: did. The demo went blank on you. There. Okay, there you go.

603
00:52:04.340 --> 00:52:06.080
Hieu: So this the end page here.

604
00:52:08.090 --> 00:52:21.030
Hieu: Now for this form that you just went through for the 1st form was the red option. Now you're going through the green option. What's the difficulty? Scale on this one? On this second form you just went through, you know, one being very easy.

605
00:52:21.030 --> 00:52:21.400
P4: Yeah.

606
00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:22.850
Hieu: 5 being very hard.

607
00:52:22.850 --> 00:52:23.919
P4: Yeah, 4, 4.

608
00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:28.279
Hieu: 4 again. Okay? And then what about efficiency? Would that also be?

609
00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:29.200
Hieu: Yeah.

610
00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:30.630
P4: Probably 4, yeah.

611
00:52:30.630 --> 00:52:31.090
Hieu: Okay.

612
00:52:31.090 --> 00:52:32.200
P4: This isn't.

613
00:52:33.290 --> 00:52:35.400
P4: This isn't efficient at all.

614
00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:36.150
Hieu: Right.

615
00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:45.000
Hieu: and then we can technically end the prototype portion here. And then I do have a couple questions for you.

616
00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:45.350
P4: Sure.

617
00:52:45.350 --> 00:52:49.079
Hieu: We? And so you can stop sharing now.

618
00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:51.220
P4: Stop, share. Okay.

619
00:52:51.220 --> 00:53:04.210
Hieu: So what was your overall thought of the 2 prototypes that you mentioned? Kind of the redundancy, the repetitive nature of it? Do you have any additional criticism for the 2 prototypes.

620
00:53:04.210 --> 00:53:05.730
P4: Yeah, you know, I I

621
00:53:06.250 --> 00:53:16.599
P4: I don't just like to criticize. I like to explain. You know, options and solutions, you know. And then this is fixable, in my opinion, but it's hard to use.

622
00:53:17.140 --> 00:53:22.749
P4: It's hard to use, because I'm just not thinking of myself. I'm thinking about the whole entire Va population.

623
00:53:22.900 --> 00:53:26.149
P4: And you're asking me to go through so many screens.

624
00:53:26.730 --> 00:53:28.030
P4: You know, people.

625
00:53:29.180 --> 00:53:37.680
P4: you know the type of society we have. It's it's quick, it's fast. We want immediate results. I mean, we don't want to keep going and going. What else do they want?

626
00:53:38.050 --> 00:53:38.860
Hieu: Right.

627
00:53:38.860 --> 00:53:44.150
P4: You know I didn't know that they wanted my financials. Now I got to stop and get up and go and get that.

628
00:53:44.710 --> 00:53:49.770
P4: What date. Was I married? I think it was. Well, I got to check that, you know.

629
00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:50.660
Hieu: Right.

630
00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:55.090
P4: A good good system, says things once easy

631
00:53:55.290 --> 00:53:57.580
P4: gives me the ability to edit.

632
00:53:58.610 --> 00:54:07.840
P4: Don't ask me a question. Give me the ability to edit, and then on the very next screen or 2 screens later, ask me the same question.

633
00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:12.369
P4: man. It's like, whoever did this didn't really look at this

634
00:54:12.740 --> 00:54:17.740
P4: right, I mean. Come on. Why? Why? Why are you asking me the same thing over and over and over

635
00:54:18.810 --> 00:54:22.930
P4: right? Ask it once, you know. Make it easy.

636
00:54:23.470 --> 00:54:28.940
P4: nice, big letters, colorful letters. Give me the option to edit.

637
00:54:29.270 --> 00:54:31.249
P4: Explain things. Once

638
00:54:31.870 --> 00:54:39.959
P4: cut this down on all the pages that I got to move from one to the next, to the next to the next, and I know I've said this over and over and over.

639
00:54:41.250 --> 00:54:47.790
Hieu: And then we're running up on time here. So I'm curious if I'm able to keep you for another additional 5 min. Here.

640
00:54:47.790 --> 00:54:48.750
P4: Sure. Yes.

641
00:54:48.750 --> 00:54:59.119
Hieu: Okay, thank you for that. So of the 2 prototype, is there one that you would prefer over the other cause? I think you lean forward more on the 1st one, that red one, because it has.

642
00:54:59.120 --> 00:54:59.540
P4: Right.

643
00:54:59.670 --> 00:55:01.560
Hieu: Because of the function. Now.

644
00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:03.840
P4: Yeah, okay, I think so. Edit

645
00:55:04.180 --> 00:55:07.720
P4: got you. Just this is obviously this is fixable.

646
00:55:08.010 --> 00:55:08.490
Hieu: Right.

647
00:55:08.490 --> 00:55:13.479
P4: I don't know if they'll use any of my suggestions or comments, but I know if I was going to do that.

648
00:55:13.610 --> 00:55:17.819
P4: make it Brit. Make it big and bright. You have a lot of veterans that

649
00:55:17.980 --> 00:55:24.169
P4: have difficulty seeing things right. Make it big, bright. Make it easy to use.

650
00:55:24.630 --> 00:55:28.649
P4: you know if you make a mistake, give me an option to go back and retype some.

651
00:55:29.630 --> 00:55:30.450
P4: You know.

652
00:55:30.890 --> 00:55:31.460
Hieu: Yep.

653
00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:39.390
Hieu: And then for this portion here I'll share my screen, and then we can kind of look at a few different options and kind of.

654
00:55:39.390 --> 00:55:39.869
P4: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

655
00:55:39.870 --> 00:55:42.910
Hieu: I want you to, you know. Share your thoughts as well.

656
00:55:42.910 --> 00:55:43.680
P4: Yeah. Sure. Go ahead.

657
00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:44.260
Hieu: Of course.

658
00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:48.619
Hieu: Do you see my screen.

659
00:55:48.620 --> 00:55:49.140
P4: I do?

660
00:55:49.550 --> 00:56:05.730
Hieu: Okay, so we have 3 different options here, A, B and C, and they present the same information. It's just the the way the present, the way that the personal information is presented is differently. Do you have a preference for one or the other.

661
00:56:06.813 --> 00:56:08.679
P4: Can I move this up and down? No.

662
00:56:08.680 --> 00:56:11.150
Hieu: No, but I can zoom in for you if you want.

663
00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:13.746
P4: That's a

664
00:56:14.180 --> 00:56:20.000
Hieu: And then B and C, yeah, it's pretty much the same, isn't it?

665
00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:23.320
Hieu: Yeah, it's the same information presented slightly differently.

666
00:56:23.984 --> 00:56:25.079
Hieu: Graphically, at least.

667
00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:33.190
P4: If you're just giving me these 3 choices it it almost looks like they're the same to me.

668
00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:36.320
Hieu: So you don't really have a preference for one or the other.

669
00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:42.460
P4: No, I mean I mean Riley Smith won your maybe one.

670
00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:54.309
P4: Why, in Riley Smith you're putting the other Riley Smith in a box on 2 and 3. You're graying that out like, why in the hell do you want to gray that out? That's personal information. Let me be able to see it

671
00:56:54.770 --> 00:56:56.950
P4: clearly. Don't gray it out.

672
00:56:57.600 --> 00:56:58.820
Hieu: Okay. So you don't like.

673
00:56:58.820 --> 00:56:59.160
P4: Drinks.

674
00:56:59.160 --> 00:56:59.760
Hieu: See you.

675
00:57:00.250 --> 00:57:02.450
P4: Yeah, you don't like the 3rd one. Okay?

676
00:57:02.450 --> 00:57:04.610
P4: Yeah. Because you're graying that information out.

677
00:57:04.610 --> 00:57:05.060
Hieu: Right.

678
00:57:05.060 --> 00:57:10.749
P4: Make it bright. Maybe you're asking me to look at it. You're asking me to review it. Why are you graying it out.

679
00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:11.740
Hieu: Right?

680
00:57:12.030 --> 00:57:17.319
Hieu: Okay? So basically, you don't have a strong preference. But you don't like the 3rd option because.

681
00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:20.369
P4: Yeah, if I had to. Maybe 1 1, because of that.

682
00:57:20.370 --> 00:57:21.340
P4: Yeah, yeah.

683
00:57:21.340 --> 00:57:24.139
Hieu: Gotcha. All right, thank you. And then the next one

684
00:57:24.390 --> 00:57:31.089
Hieu: presenting kind of the marital status portion. Here one is a drop down, and one is kind of a multiple selection.

685
00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:34.940
P4: I would say one, because the dropdown you can select

686
00:57:36.243 --> 00:57:41.800
P4: the other one. You're just having me click on it and choose.

687
00:57:42.110 --> 00:57:42.990
Hieu: So.

688
00:57:44.100 --> 00:57:56.320
Hieu: and then for this scenario, if let's say you previously entered that you're married, and now you're either divorced or widow. And you see this. You see this message.

689
00:57:57.330 --> 00:58:02.810
Hieu: Let's say it changed from to widow or divorce.

690
00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:04.130
P4: Remarried.

691
00:58:04.130 --> 00:58:07.310
Hieu: Or remarriage. Yeah, how do you feel about this message?

692
00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:14.210
P4: Yes. Change.

693
00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:16.889
Hieu: Okay. So it's not confusing to you.

694
00:58:16.890 --> 00:58:24.110
P4: Change it. I think you I'm assuming. If I say yes, change, you're going to give me options like, what change am I going to give you

695
00:58:24.260 --> 00:58:27.680
P4: like remarried, divorced, widowed.

696
00:58:27.860 --> 00:58:36.049
P4: So if I click, yes, change, I'm assuming that the next box that I click. Yes, change will give me those options.

697
00:58:36.390 --> 00:58:37.300
Hieu: Gotcha.

698
00:58:37.300 --> 00:58:38.160
P4: Right.

699
00:58:38.660 --> 00:58:41.369
Hieu: So in this case it's

700
00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:48.799
Hieu: technically, you already have information existing. And now you're just deleting the existing information here.

701
00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:58.269
P4: Okay, I'm just assuming when I click on. Yes, change. I'm gonna you're gonna be asking me what the changes are giving me the option for the changes. I

702
00:58:58.270 --> 00:59:05.440
P4: okay. So you you want more of a additional, like a like another set of right.

703
00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:10.560
P4: Unless the box before this I've already agreed to like widowed.

704
00:59:11.010 --> 00:59:11.630
Hieu: Of course.

705
00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:18.320
Hieu: So in this scenario you're changing it from married to widow, let's say, and then this shows up.

706
00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:19.740
P4: Then yes, change. Yes.

707
00:59:19.740 --> 00:59:21.500
Hieu: Okay, gotcha.

708
00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:26.310
Hieu: And then finally, the comparison between, like the financial information.

709
00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:29.560
Hieu: the 2 different ways that you can view it.

710
00:59:40.490 --> 00:59:50.180
P4: yeah. My spouse's information I have on number 2 here. Yeah. But on the left number one there is none. Are you? Gonna give me?

711
00:59:50.580 --> 00:59:57.320
P4: Do I just click on that? Is there a down arrow? How do I get that information? Because it's blank on number One?

712
00:59:58.020 --> 00:59:59.839
Hieu: Are you referring to this great box here.

713
01:00:00.030 --> 01:00:05.019
P4: So if you go over to the very next one you says inter spouses, gross annual income.

714
01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:05.640
Hieu: Yeah.

715
01:00:06.010 --> 01:00:09.769
P4: So number 2, you already have it provided.

716
01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:15.669
P4: So number one, you're saying, input, meaning I, you're giving me the ability to type it in.

717
01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:17.340
P4: Is that right?

718
01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:18.970
Hieu: Yes, that is correct.

719
01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:29.709
P4: Obviously, number 2 is easier if you already have it. If you already have my spouse's gross income.

720
01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:38.639
Hieu: I just want to clarify that there is also a an input down here. But this provides you with an older input kind of.

721
01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:39.550
P4: Oh, okay.

722
01:00:40.195 --> 01:00:40.840
Hieu: Information.

723
01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:45.000
P4: All right. Cause 1st time. Looking at that. It looks like you already. Have that answer.

724
01:00:45.170 --> 01:00:47.540
Hieu: Okay, so that's how you view it. The 1st time.

725
01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:56.560
P4: Well, yeah, your spouse's gross income for 2023. Okay, I'm sorry. And then there's 2024. So if it changed, then you would put the new amount in.

726
01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:57.600
Hieu: Yes.

727
01:00:58.010 --> 01:00:59.020
P4: Right? Okay?

728
01:00:59.650 --> 01:01:02.590
P4: So yeah, I'd probably say, number number 2 here, the one.

729
01:01:02.590 --> 01:01:04.800
Hieu: So you prefer the more information because.

730
01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:05.180
P4: Yeah.

731
01:01:05.180 --> 01:01:06.360
Hieu: Provided you the.

732
01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:09.780
P4: Right, gotcha, we do away with the shaded area. But okay.

733
01:01:09.780 --> 01:01:15.240
Hieu: Right? Okay. Can you ex elaborate on that? Is it because of the gray box again, you rather.

734
01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:20.799
P4: Why are you shading it out? Are you trying to get my attention to that box?

735
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:25.689
P4: And it's you want figures and things like that you're dealing with. Older

736
01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:31.299
P4: veterans. Don't shade it out, make it nice, clean and neat, and and and open.

737
01:01:31.950 --> 01:01:47.660
Hieu: Okay, Yup, and then I can stop sharing there. And that is the last of kind of the prototype and whatnot. And let's see you know. Thank you for so much for going through this with me. Do you have any additional feedbacks.

738
01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:59.789
P4: You know the only thing. It's great that you guys are doing this, and I know the whole entire purpose. You want to make it better. And this is why I participate in this, you know, because I use it a lot.

739
01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:16.710
P4: And I really, you know, thank you for doing this. And I'm so happy that I could participate. I apologize to all the listeners that if I sounded redundant on things and or opinionated on things, it's just I'm trying to give you my honest opinion. And

740
01:02:17.550 --> 01:02:23.409
P4: again, you know, we have so many different types of veterans. If you can just make it as easy as possible.

741
01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:26.950
P4: and don't say the same things over and over and over.

742
01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:33.069
P4: right ease of use, right ease of use, you know, no matter what you do, whether you're in a Va. Or not, I mean.

743
01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:55.579
Hieu: I mean, one of the ways that we do push out for change is, you know, getting feedback like you, and then coming back to the team, indicating, Hey, this is what the veteran wants, and then, if enough of enough, you know enough veteran wants certain things, then we move forward. That change essentially, not always the case. Some of your frustration has been

744
01:02:55.710 --> 01:03:06.430
Hieu: said, you know, before or whatnot, and then others. I think it's it's too different. Or for one reason or another, we cannot do that. So it's just like whatever is possible. We move forward with the change.

745
01:03:08.130 --> 01:03:23.260
Hieu: But yeah, thank you for this I want to circle back, and I want to see if my other colleagues have any questions, but otherwise I want to circle back and reconfirm that you are comfortable if we share a video clip of this session with our Va. Partners.

746
01:03:23.260 --> 01:03:24.010
P4: Yes.

747
01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:31.420
Hieu: Okay? And again, just to remind you, we do remove any kind of personal information that would identify you. And

748
01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:54.740
Hieu: other than that, you know, like, I said, I really appreciate you taking your time to share your thoughts and feedback with us. It's very helpful for us to kind of continue working on the site and making it better for veterans, you know, for all types of veterans. And then, lastly, Peregin will send you like a thank you notice with a little blurb, that you can pass to other veterans who you know that might

749
01:03:54.830 --> 01:03:59.750
Hieu: that might want to participate in future studies as well.

750
01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:01.569
P4: Good. Okay.

751
01:04:01.570 --> 01:04:04.879
Hieu: Okay, thank you for that, and enjoy the rest of the day.

752
01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:06.349
P4: Okay, thank you so much.

753
01:04:06.350 --> 01:04:07.909
P4: Alright. Thank you. Enjoy.
