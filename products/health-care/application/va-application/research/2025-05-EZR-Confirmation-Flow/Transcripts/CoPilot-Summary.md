# Confirmation Flow Research Summary

## P1
**General Impressions**
- The participant (P1) is a 100% permanently disabled veteran and experienced va.gov user.
- They use va.gov regularly, mainly for messaging regarding appointments and follow-ups.
- The participant was comfortable with the scenario, found the process familiar, and had positive prior experience with the VA’s online updates.

**Feedback on Page Flow and Usability**
- The interface was described as familiar, with colors and fonts matching previous VA experiences.
- Navigation was quick and effortless due to pre-filled information and intuitive layout.
- The participant appreciated features such as the “request saved” indicator, especially for longer or interrupted sessions.
- Editing and confirming personal information (address, marital status, dependents) felt straightforward.
- The participant expected clear options (e.g., single, divorced, never married) if changing marital status and assumed the system would save updates automatically.
- For their own case, most information was unchanged, so the process was very fast.

**Feedback on Financial and Deductible Information**
- Entering financial data was not confusing; the participant would enter “0” for income in their real situation due to no taxable income.
- The participant noted that if income or deductions were applicable, they would have the information ready to enter.
- No difficulties or confusion were reported about what was being asked in the financial or deductible sections.

**Suggestions and Additional Insights**
- The process was rated “1” (very easy) for both difficulty and efficiency.
- The participant mentioned that creating a VA.gov account is often the hardest part for other veterans, but once inside, the application/update process is “quite easy.”
- The participant appreciated the evolution from phone-based or manual processes to much more efficient online forms.
- On a mobile device, the participant found font size could be a concern and suggested attention to accessibility for users with different needs.

**Key Takeaways**
- Keep the interface familiar and pre-fill as much information as possible.
- Maintain clear, simple steps—especially for users with unchanged or straightforward circumstances.
- Accessibility (e.g., font size on mobile) should be considered for older adults or those with vision needs.
- The online update process is a significant improvement over older, manual methods and is generally well-received by veterans who are able to access it.


## P2
**General Flow and Familiarity**
- The participant found the process familiar and straightforward, with most steps being easy to understand and complete.
- The flow generally matched expectations for updating personal and financial information.

**Navigation and UI Feedback**
- Clear ability to update personal information was appreciated.
- Saving progress and finishing the form later was valued.
- Screen progression indicators ("1 of 3", "2 of 3") should update intuitively after hitting "continue."
- The presence of a "back" button was helpful.
- "Home phone" field felt outdated but understandable.

**Marital Status and Dependents**
- When changing marital status, the participant expected to be prompted for relevant follow-up information (e.g., date of divorce or death), as this affects benefits.
- Logical, context-sensitive follow-up questions were expected.
- The limit of “up to 6” dependents stood out but was not an issue for this user.
- Clearer handling was suggested for cases where a dependent is deceased or no longer qualifies.

**Form Logic and Data Pre-Population**
- The participant wanted to review currently stored information before being asked if there are changes to income or deductions.
- Found it inefficient to re-enter unchanged information; suggested a “No Change” option or pre-population of fields with last year’s data.
- Auto-filling previous information if unchanged was seen as highly desirable.

**Timeouts and Saving Progress**
- The option to save and finish the form later was valued, especially for sections requiring more time (like financial details).
- A visible countdown timer or warning was suggested if the session is set to time out, especially for short inactivity windows.

**Clarity and Information**
- Brief explanations for form sections (such as why certain information is asked) were appreciated.
- For some fields (e.g., “enrolled in school”), the participant wanted more context or explanation about what qualifies.

**Overall Impression**
- The process was clear and largely intuitive.
- Main suggestions centered on reducing redundant data entry, improving step transitions, and making timeouts transparent.
- No parts of the flow were confusing; feedback was practical and focused on streamlining the user experience.

**Summary of Suggestions:**
- Make step progression (“1 of 3”, etc.) update more intuitively.
- Allow users to review current data before being asked about changes.
- Provide a “No Change” or auto-fill option for unchanged data.
- Clarify requirements for fields like “enrolled in school” and handling of dependents.
- Display a timer or warning before session timeout.
- Continue supporting the ability to save and finish later.

## P3

**General Impressions**
- The participant found the EZR Confirmation Flow prototypes easy to use and highly efficient, consistently rating the process as “1” (very easy) on difficulty and efficiency scales.
- Prefilled information and the ability to easily edit entries were highly appreciated.

**Green Option Prototype**
- Clear structure, similar to familiar tax forms, was noted.

## P4

**Summary of User Feedback on EZR Confirmation Flow Prototype (P4)**

**General Impressions**
- The participant is a frequent user of va.gov and has an 80% service-connected disability rating. They use the portal for updates and maintaining their information.
- The participant provided candid feedback on usability, page flow, and the type of information requested.

**Feedback on Page Flow and Usability**
- The participant found the process unnecessarily repetitive, with many screens asking for similar or redundant information (e.g., confirming contact info after just editing it, repeatedly stating “we saved your request”).
- They suggested consolidating multiple steps into a single, longer page to streamline the experience and reduce frustration from repeated clicking and navigation.
- The ability to edit information directly was appreciated, but the participant felt that some options (e.g., separate entries for home and mailing address) could be simplified with a checkbox indicating if both are the same.
- The participant emphasized the need to keep the process straightforward and accessible, especially for older or less tech-savvy veterans.

**Content and Relevance of Requested Information**
- The participant expressed strong reluctance about providing household financial information, questioning its relevance to healthcare benefits, especially for those with high disability ratings.
- They felt it was invasive and unnecessary for their situation, and noted that it was not explained why this information was being collected. This lack of context caused discomfort and a desire to stop the process and contact the VA directly.
- The participant wanted clearer upfront explanations of why such personal details are needed, and for whom these questions are required (e.g., those with lower disability ratings or for copay determinations).
- The process of gathering financial documents (e.g., W-2s, tax forms) felt burdensome and would likely cause them to abandon the application.

**Specific UI/UX Suggestions**
- Remove redundant questions and repeated statements.
- Combine related pages and present all necessary information on a single page when possible.
- Use clear, simple language and minimize the number of actions required to proceed.
- Provide context for why sensitive information (like finances) is requested and for whom it is necessary.
- The option to edit or delete dependents was found awkward; further clarity about why and when this is needed would be helpful.

**Additional User Insights**
- The participant stressed that the process should consider the varying digital literacy of veterans, advocating for simplicity.
- Frustration increases with each repetitive or unexplained step, and this may lead users to drop out or seek help by calling the VA.

**Key Suggestions**
- Simplify navigation by reducing the number of pages and redundant elements.
- Clearly explain the purpose of collecting sensitive information.
- Make the process as accessible and intuitive as possible for all age groups and tech abilities.


## P5

**General Impressions**
- The participant (P5) found both prototype options (green and red) generally clear, easy to use, and efficient.
- P5 had a 10% VA disability rating and used va.gov primarily for appointment checks.
- The process of verifying information and progressing through the forms was straightforward for them.

**Feedback on Option Green**
- The participant appreciated the clarity and logic of the form, easily verifying personal and address information.
- The "We've saved your request" message was mildly confusing, as it was unclear what "request" referred to in the prototype, but P5 thought it would make sense in a real scenario.
- The distinction between home and mailing address was understood after a prompt, but initial instructions could clarify this scenario more directly.
- All financial and deductible information was clear, and the participant had no confusion about the requirements.
- P5 found it easy to gather required financial documents, but noted that others might find this more difficult and suggested a possible way to address when information isn't readily available.
- The review page with expandable/collapsible sections met expectations for being able to check and edit details.
- Overall, P5 rated the difficulty and efficiency of the green option as “1” (very easy/efficient).

**Feedback on Option Red**
- P5 liked the condensed, one-screen overview format, finding it simpler and preferable, especially for mobile use.
- The ability to quickly verify and edit information in a single place was seen as more efficient than spread-out screens.
- The “married” status shown next to the spouse’s name was viewed as redundant and potentially confusing—if it’s a spouse, the marital status is implied.
- P5 questioned why dependent information wasn’t pre-filled like the spouse section, suggesting it would be more consistent and user-friendly if all pre-existing data was shown together.
- The limit of “add up to 5 more dependents” was flagged as a potential issue for users with larger families—P5 wondered what would happen if someone had more than the allowed number.
- The mention of a “full PDF form, title, VA form number” at the top was unclear; P5 questioned what this referenced.
- P5 wanted more upfront explanation on screens asking about income and deductible expenses, suggesting a need for examples or clearer prompts to guide responses.

**Additional Insights**
- P5 preferred the condensed overview (red option) for its ease on mobile and desktop, but was comfortable with both flows.
- Editable core info (like date of birth) would be preferable, rather than requiring a call or in-person visit for corrections.
- The participant was highly self-sufficient with documentation but recognized that others may need more support or flexibility (such as bypass options or clear requirement messaging).
- P5 valued clarity, consistency, and minimal redundancy throughout the process.

**Key Suggestions**
- Clarify the meaning of persistent messages (e.g., “request saved”) and scenario-based instructions.
- Make all editable information (including date of birth) easy to update online.
- Pre-fill dependent information when possible for consistency.
- Remove redundant status indicators (e.g., “married” next to spouse).
- Allow for more than 5 dependents if needed, or provide guidance for larger families.
- Add examples or explanations when asking about financial/deductible inputs to aid understanding.
- Maintain a condensed, single-screen overview for efficiency, especially on mobile devices.

##P6

**General Impressions**
- The overall flow and forms were described as familiar and similar to the current VA website.
- Most sections were straightforward and easy to understand, with minimal confusion or questions.

**Form Usability**
- Participant found the forms simple to navigate and appreciated the pre-filled information.
- The process of updating information was clear and did not raise significant usability concerns.
- The only suggestion for improvement in data entry was to include more identifiers (e.g., date of birth) for dependents to help confirm their identity.

**Financial Information Section**
- The participant appreciated that previous financial data (e.g., 2023 numbers) were shown, making it easier to reference and update.
- Completing the financial section was rated as "2" on a difficulty scale of 1 (very easy) to 5 (very hard), mainly due to the complexity of real-life finances (multiple income sources, W-2, 1099, investments), not the form itself.
- The form instructions were clear, but the participant suggested including references to common tax forms (e.g., W-2, 1099) to help users know where to find the requested data.
- The participant suggested integrating with other government systems to auto-populate financial information, reducing manual entry and errors.

**Efficiency and Preferences**
- Overall efficiency was rated as "2" (1 = very efficient, 5 = very inefficient), noting integration would make it more efficient.
- Participant had no strong preference between reviewing information all on one page versus page-by-page, but noted that for large amounts of information, a page-by-page approach is easier to follow.

**Consistency and Clarity**
- Participant expected consistency in how addresses are handled (mailing vs. home address for both veteran and spouse/dependents).
- Noted a minor inconsistency where only one address was asked for in some parts, which could be clarified for a smoother experience.

**Suggestions for Improvement**
- Provide clear examples or expandable sections listing the types of forms (W-2, 1099, etc.) users should reference for each input.
- Add more options to directly edit specific information (like deductible expenses) on summary pages.
- Ensure consistent handling and questioning of addresses throughout the form.
- Integrate with external government data sources to auto-fill information, minimizing user effort and reducing potential errors.

**Overall Experience**
- The user found both prototype options (red and green) to be similar in ease and clarity.
- Both forms were rated as easy to complete, with efficiency only limited by the need for manual data entry.
- The participant’s main pain point was gathering real financial data, not the form design.
