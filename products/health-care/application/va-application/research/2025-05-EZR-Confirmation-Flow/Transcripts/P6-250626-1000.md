1
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:10.420
Hieu: So I have started recording. And I'd like to confirm that you are comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today.

2
00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:11.150
P6: Yes.

3
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:24.260
Hieu: And then, are you comfortable? We decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with our Va partners. If we remove any information that can be used to identify you.

4
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.040
P6: Yes.

5
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.150
Hieu: All right. Thank you for that. And then that's all the technical things. And now we get into the

6
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.999
Hieu: the more fun stuff for the warm-up questions.

7
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.459
Hieu: do you have a service-connected disability rating at the Va.

8
00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.180
P6: Yes.

9
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.430
Hieu: And then what is your disability? Rating percentage or number.

10
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:46.140
P6: 80.

11
00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.919
Hieu: 80. Okay? And then have you visited the va.gov.

12
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.040
P6: Yes.

13
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.280
Hieu: What? What was it for.

14
00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.379
P6: Medication, Refill request.

15
00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:08.659
Hieu: I see. Alright, and then we'll move on to our prototype. So today we'll be going through 2 different prototype. One is option green, and one is option red.

16
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:37.699
Hieu: This may not pertain to you particularly, but in this scenario you have a spouse and one dependent. You have filled out a similar form before. And now they're asking you to update your financial information in this scenario. You logged into your va.gov account, and then the system has pre-filled some information for you for this scenario. Are you comfortable with sharing your screen

17
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:47.110
Hieu: and talking through this process? All right, let me give you a the prototype to kind of load.

18
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.370
Hieu: so I pasted it in the chat.

19
00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:58.239
Hieu: If you can click it so it loads, and then once you're ready you can share screen and then be sure to close any kind of

20
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.069
Hieu: personal information like email, Facebook or anything before you share screen.

21
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.440
Hieu: And then let me know if you you need any help.

22
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.570
P6: I forgot which I'm gonna mention.

23
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.610
Hieu: Yep, that is correct.

24
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.609
Hieu: So I see your screen with the prototype on there.

25
00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.570
Hieu: And then you can adjust it any way you like.

26
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.990
P6: Sorry. I'm just just set this message here over here to the team.

27
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:44.949
Hieu: Let me know when you're ready

28
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:57.340
Hieu: up. Can you scroll down and move back right there? Yeah, alright

29
00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.800
Hieu: So today for you, we'll start with the red option.

30
00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.770
P6: Go ahead!

31
00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.309
Hieu: Option red, and then you can click on that. So if you scroll up there

32
00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:23.550
Hieu: now, please take a few moments to go through this page. I'd like you to kind of think out loud as much as possible, noting anything that's confusing or just your thoughts as you're going through this

33
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.019
Hieu: in this scenario. You're Riley Smith.

34
00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.715
Hieu: Okay.

35
00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:45.849
P6: No, just updating the information. It looks just like our current looks like our current website.

36
00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.260
Hieu: Okay, so you're very familiar with it, and seems like you don't have any confusion. Then.

37
00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.910
Hieu: Okay, you can continue.

38
00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:08.240
Hieu: And then, as I mentioned before in this scenario. This information came from previous information you've provided, and for research purposes you would be going through this form to make sure the fill-in are accurate and make sense.

39
00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:16.420
P6: Let me, I assume, the mailing address and the home address are correct, but American looks easy and simple.

40
00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:17.500
Hieu: Okay?

41
00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:23.919
Hieu: Yeah. So it seems like, no issue for you, and kind of no questions. So far.

42
00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:24.600
P6: No.

43
00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.540
Hieu: Okay, we can move along.

44
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.481
P6: We'll see similar to the last time I used the health benefits update form.

45
00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.590
Hieu: Okay, so very simple, very. What do you call it? Very familiar? Then.

46
00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:46.800
P6: Continue.

47
00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.750
Hieu: Yeah, and then continue.

48
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.260
P6: That's why we ask for some reason

49
00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.390
P6: that is pre-fill for Jordan Smurf.

50
00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:09.929
P6: It's so funny. It looks simple, but I mean, so I think. Usually they include like a date of birth or something.

51
00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.900
Hieu: Okay.

52
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:16.479
Hieu: And then would that be more helpful for you, instead of having display like this? Then.

53
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:22.330
P6: I mean, it might be more helpful for identifying information to like. Do identifiers.

54
00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.960
Hieu: Gotcha. All right. We can move along.

55
00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:34.460
P6: See?

56
00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:42.049
P6: Looks same.

57
00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.060
P6: No questions about this part.

58
00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.500
Hieu: Gotcha, and continue.

59
00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:56.750
P6: So we're adding, Michael, well, this one's 1 already that's already in. And so we are adding another dependent. Is that correct?

60
00:05:57.581 --> 00:05:59.748
Hieu: No, so we are not.

61
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.890
P6: Okay.

62
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:07.519
Hieu: So for this scenario, we're not changing any of your previous information. We're only adding financial information.

63
00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.540
P6: Do you have an income?

64
00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:19.290
P6: Do you have income and deductible expenses to add for nursing? Yes, discontinue.

65
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.190
Hieu: Okay?

66
00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:47.719
Hieu: And then I'll pause you right there for this section. I'll give you financial information that you'll need for this scenario. You and your spouse's work and salary has not changed from 2023 to 2024. If you're doing this for real, you would need to gather this financial information, most likely from your W. 2, and kind of any other expenses that you may have accumulated over the year.

67
00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.180
Hieu: And then so it would be something like this.

68
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:59.300
Hieu: And then you can kind of continue filling this out. But

69
00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:06.779
Hieu: since this is a demo. If you click on the input, it would automatically fill in the number that you'll need.

70
00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:11.869
Hieu: But if you're doing this for real, you know, you need to find that number.

71
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:13.679
P6: So I'm not supposed to put any numbers in here.

72
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.840
Hieu: You are supposed to fill in the space.

73
00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.870
P6: But it's not letting me fill anything in.

74
00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:24.400
Hieu: Right for a, because it's a demo.

75
00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.579
P6: Oh, good!

76
00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:29.409
Hieu: Yeah. But in, if this is real, you'll need to fill in the numbers.

77
00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:30.210
P6: Go ahead.

78
00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:43.360
P6: So I was trying to type in stuff. It didn't let me type anything in. So it says there's no income in exclamation year, enter 0. So is this supposed to be exclamation point, or an actual year? Or will that be changed into your website?

79
00:07:43.667 --> 00:07:48.280
Hieu: So in the website, it will be the actual year instead of the exclamation year.

80
00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.470
Hieu: it's it's a coding thing that's.

81
00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:00.659
P6: Those offer. Let me try some time.

82
00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:04.610
P6: so am I supposed to do anything else with this.

83
00:08:05.553 --> 00:08:07.259
Hieu: I'm sorry I didn't catch your question.

84
00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.599
P6: Oh, am I supposed to do anything else with this website?

85
00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:16.999
Hieu: No, it was just more like, did it make sense to you as you're going through this or anything that's kind of weird or awkward to you?

86
00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:31.680
P6: So gross income from work is income before taxes and any deductibles. So wages. So if the gross income from work is like from your W. 2, I guess. Would it be more useful to include the word W. 2. For people who are W. 2 wage earners.

87
00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.900
P6: 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2,

88
00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:45.640
P6: otherwise I think it sounds fine.

89
00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:47.840
Hieu: Okay, that's fine. Then.

90
00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:49.200
P6: Oh, excuse me!

91
00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:56.489
Hieu: You don't have an issue with any of the explanation so far. Okay, we can move along.

92
00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:09.969
P6: Also income, gross income from work, super taxes, ranges, tips, and travels

93
00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:25.069
P6: oops the same as the one before.

94
00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:29.349
P6: so I don't know how many I should have. How many questions about it.

95
00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:34.540
Hieu: Okay, and then in you'll have to kind of fill it out if you will.

96
00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:35.760
Hieu: But.

97
00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:40.439
P6: It's not letting me put any numbers in.

98
00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.622
Hieu: Right? It's a so it's like a fake

99
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:47.509
Hieu: feature. So you're not actually typing in anything.

100
00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:48.940
P6: Supposed to click on it right.

101
00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:49.990
Hieu: Yeah, correct.

102
00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.360
P6: Don't they have this.

103
00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:58.249
Hieu: And then, once you're done with that you can continue. But no, no issues with it. So far.

104
00:09:58.250 --> 00:09:58.970
P6: Oh.

105
00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:40.250
P6: it looks pretty straightforward.

106
00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:41.500
Hieu: Gotcha.

107
00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:45.500
P6: Don't have any questions at all.

108
00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:48.070
Hieu: Okay, that's fine. Then we move on.

109
00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:51.290
Hieu: Or once you're finished reviewing, we can move on.

110
00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:01.909
P6: So these are numbers that we have previously put in correct.

111
00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:03.006
Hieu: It's that

112
00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.870
P6: Recording for nicely smoking system.

113
00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:10.579
Hieu: Is that your assumption or presumption.

114
00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:14.630
P6: Yeah. But these are numbers that we just wanna, I think I recognize that from a 32.

115
00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:17.500
Hieu: Okay. And then we can pause right here.

116
00:11:18.001 --> 00:11:24.099
Hieu: So so far, any of that part was confusing to you, or it was very straightforward.

117
00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.140
P6: Straightforward.

118
00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:33.780
Hieu: Okay? And then when you are. When you saw the 2,023 financial number.

119
00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:36.579
Hieu: did that help you in any ways or.

120
00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:37.820
P6: Yeah did it.

121
00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:42.399
P6: And I can figure out which one you were talking about beforehand.

122
00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:46.400
Hieu: Gotcha.

123
00:11:46.600 --> 00:12:03.970
Hieu: and then so far on the financial information portion on a scale of one to 5, 1 being very easy and 5 being very hard. How difficult would it be for you to complete this financial information section if you were to do this with your real information.

124
00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:09.379
P6: My real information, like my real W. 2, and stuff like that.

125
00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:10.170
Hieu: Yeah.

126
00:12:10.521 --> 00:12:13.329
P6: Probably the 2. I shouldn't play too hard.

127
00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:14.540
Hieu: And then why?

128
00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:19.930
P6: It's not very easy, because I'm also W. 2 and a 1099, and all the others

129
00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:21.930
P6: investments and stuff.

130
00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:22.810
Hieu: I gotcha.

131
00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:28.609
P6: So I mean, if I was just a plain W. 2, it should be fine. But we, as a married couple, we have a lot of

132
00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:31.200
P6: other stuff.

133
00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:35.599
Hieu: So it's like your sources of income and whatnot that makes it complicated.

134
00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.299
P6: Not not the forms.

135
00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:42.600
Hieu: Okay. So the form itself is relatively straightforward. But the the process itself might not be.

136
00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:46.020
P6: That's gotcha of gathering all the data. So if I

137
00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:49.429
P6: recently do my taxes and I wouldn't have.

138
00:12:50.072 --> 00:12:52.970
P6: But, like all the information, straightforward.

139
00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:58.959
Hieu: That's fair. And then do you have any suggestion or feedback for making the pages or update process? Better.

140
00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:04.799
P6: Oh, would you be able to directly get the information from

141
00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:14.840
P6: the government website? Like, you know, when you do your taxes from fidelity, it just automatically submits all the information to turbotax for you.

142
00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:20.330
Hieu: I gotcha. So you'd like to be able to pull from other government website if possible.

143
00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:21.120
P6: Possible.

144
00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:24.709
Hieu: I want to say. That's not.

145
00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:29.090
Hieu: But that would be. Would that be an ideal situation? Then.

146
00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:39.889
P6: Yeah, because then you don't have to re-enter all that information, and you'll reduce the risk of typing error, like in case someone says, oh, no, I thought I saw a 0 here, but it was really a 2,

147
00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:43.859
P6: or they added an extra 0 to no numbers, for the new row.

148
00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:51.289
Hieu: So you prefer, you know, the the integration, basically of all the government services that makes sense

149
00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:53.610
Hieu: alright. Then we can move on.

150
00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:35.429
Hieu: And then you can think out loud. If you're you have any thoughts.

151
00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:41.670
P6: No, it's very straightforward date of birth, plus social security.

152
00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:46.910
P6: And like from 2024, that's about 2024 information

153
00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:54.829
P6: stuff that there was previously sent.

154
00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:55.260
Hieu: Okay.

155
00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:56.210
P6: Good things.

156
00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:00.979
Hieu: And then I'll pause you right there. So in this scenario you realize that.

157
00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:14.199
Hieu: sorry in this scenario, you realize that one of your expenses incorrect. You had a big, out-of-pocket dental operation last year of $3,000. How would you go about fixing that error.

158
00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:16.070
P6: From others.

159
00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:20.220
Hieu: Okay? And then there's a couple of other kind of

160
00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:34.310
Hieu: port. There's a couple of other sections that you could have done that as well, including the last page. And then, you know, there's 1 in the at the edit in this page as well. Do you have a preference for one or another.

161
00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:39.480
P6: Prefer doing it directly to like if it's a deductible expenses.

162
00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:45.210
Hieu: Okay. So you prefer to like, have it right here and and adjust it right away.

163
00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:51.509
P6: Yeah. And then having this option to do that in case I can't figure out this edit button where it doesn't work.

164
00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:56.940
Hieu: Gotcha. So basically it was, it was pretty simple for you one way or the other.

165
00:15:57.370 --> 00:16:07.790
Hieu: and then, in terms of the whole, form itself on a difficulty, scale of one to 5, 1 being very easy and 5 being very hard, how would you rate the form you just went through.

166
00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:09.270
P6: It was easy.

167
00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:10.440
Hieu: Was easy.

168
00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:14.160
Hieu: And then do you do you have a rating for that?

169
00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:15.310
P6: One. I'm sorry.

170
00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:16.639
Hieu: One. Okay?

171
00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:26.919
Hieu: And then on efficiency scale of one to 5, 1 being very efficient and 5 being very inefficient. How would you rate the formula you just went through.

172
00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:30.669
P6: I'll read it, too, because it would be better if it was integrated.

173
00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:32.600
Hieu: I gotcha.

174
00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:38.180
Hieu: That's fair, alright, and then you can scroll down there to the bottom

175
00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:51.980
Hieu: end. Demo Button. We can end that this portion, so we just complete the red option. And now we'll move on to the green option, and in this option some of the screen will be the same. Some will be different.

176
00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:57.630
Hieu: So go ahead, and you know the same process of reviewing it, and then thinking out loud.

177
00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:05.800
P6: Hold on

178
00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:20.329
P6: also about mailing address oops someone.

179
00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.550
P6: but this one has this extra

180
00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:29.210
P6: also. What's his name today?

181
00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:44.015
Hieu: I'll pause right there.

182
00:17:44.830 --> 00:18:01.229
Hieu: So you notice there's a slight difference from the previous one you just review, or that you just went through. Do you have a preference for review your information page by page like this option, or through the kind of the overview cards like the previous option.

183
00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:05.999
P6: I think it depends on how much information we're going through.

184
00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:14.199
P6: either order both. Okay with me. But if I if it's like too much information that

185
00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:16.540
P6: so it's easier to see page by page.

186
00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:17.719
Hieu: And then.

187
00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:23.140
P6: To mailing and full address on the same page, and then.

188
00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:33.019
Hieu: So it's it's not so much of. Oh, if you prefer one or another, it's that. It depends on the amount of information that is displayed.

189
00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:38.849
Hieu: And are you saying that if it's not that much information you'd rather have the overview? Then.

190
00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:39.710
P6: Yes.

191
00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:46.950
Hieu: Okay? And then for anything that's detail or heavy. Then you want it page by page.

192
00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:47.570
P6: Correct.

193
00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:50.040
Hieu: Gotcha. Thank you for that feedback.

194
00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:52.490
Hieu: and then we can move on once you're ready.

195
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:15.700
P6: And this one gives the social security date of birth date of

196
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:20.960
P6: we'll send them.

197
00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:22.150
Hieu: Okay.

198
00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:32.430
P6: Oh! So!

199
00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:34.889
Hieu: No worries.

200
00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:46.790
P6: Since we currently have the same address. No, it looks simple.

201
00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:48.290
Hieu: Okay.

202
00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.009
P6: People execution.

203
00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:15.750
P6: household furnitures, spouses, adults.

204
00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:24.240
P6: That's simple, I guess. Would

205
00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:31.219
P6: would there be? Would there be like a section saying, Is it the Spouse. Mailing. Address versus home. Address.

206
00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:33.689
Hieu: I'm sorry I didn't catch your question.

207
00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:42.540
P6: You know how they had the in the beginning. For the veteran they have the mailing and home address. This one just gives, like the one address.

208
00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:48.549
Hieu: Is that confusing to you to ask only one thing, and then it's not similar to the

209
00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:50.320
Hieu: the veteran portion.

210
00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:57.089
P6: Sometimes because usually in the bottom, they'll ask, Is this the mailing address the same as your home address, or something.

211
00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:57.570
Hieu: I'll show.

212
00:20:57.570 --> 00:20:58.460
P6: Button.

213
00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:01.830
Hieu: So you're expecting it to ask both addresses as well.

214
00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:04.029
P6: Yeah, just because you were asked before.

215
00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:07.819
Hieu: Gotcha, so that it's not as consistent.

216
00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:11.630
Hieu: All right.

217
00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:15.010
Hieu: Move along there.

218
00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:26.070
P6: Pretty restrictions.

219
00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:27.340
Hieu: Okay?

220
00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:39.600
Hieu: And then again, like in the previous financial information that I gave you, you can. It's the same exact scenario your spouse's working salary has not changed.

221
00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:46.620
P6: This is.

222
00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:52.930
P6: it looks straightforward.

223
00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:54.020
Hieu: Gotcha.

224
00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:13.769
P6: But I wonder if just give me examples of the forms that you would get from a

225
00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:29.949
P6: what was it from the the government like, if you're filling out a 1099, or like what was the like? A 1099 interest form, or like different forms of people, would just not be able to figure out easily which forms to find the users off of.

226
00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:36.430
Hieu: So you'd rather have, like a list of the Pacific form that you would get these information from.

227
00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:43.609
P6: Yeah, or maybe, like a section that will, you can expand and say, Hey, what are the other forms that you can have examples from.

228
00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:44.740
Hieu: Gotcha.

229
00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:57.580
P6: He's also strictly.

230
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:11.640
Hieu: And then I'll pause right there.

231
00:23:12.686 --> 00:23:18.030
Hieu: So for this section, for this prototype, especially the financial portion

232
00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:25.129
Hieu: again. Was this. Was there any part of this session that was confusing to you, or you wanted more information.

233
00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:27.180
P6: No, this is pretty straightforward.

234
00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:28.010
Hieu: Gotcha.

235
00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:31.520
P6: Healthcare costs that you pay for like basically coldplays.

236
00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:32.603
Hieu: And then

237
00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:40.980
Hieu: and then how was this financial section compared to the previous one? You went through.

238
00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:42.719
P6: Looks similar.

239
00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:49.359
Hieu: Similar. Okay? And then on a scale of one to 5, 1 being very easy, 5 being very hard. How would it?

240
00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:56.729
Hieu: How hard would it be for you to complete this financial information? If you're to do this with real information.

241
00:23:57.190 --> 00:23:58.929
P6: Should one be using zoom.

242
00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:07.249
Hieu: One is easy, and then I just want to clarify that. I think previously you mentioned 2. Would this be easier than that? Then.

243
00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:08.706
P6: Let me

244
00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:19.210
P6: do. We need think it's similar, I guess I would say 2 and be consistent. Then.

245
00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:26.190
Hieu: Okay, so consistently. 2 across the board, Gotcha.

246
00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:29.089
Hieu: and then we can move on to the next one.

247
00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:38.469
Hieu: Oh, it's taking a bit to load there

248
00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:25.210
Hieu: and then again on for the overall form. The second form that you just went through on a difficulty scale of one to 5, 1 being very easy, and 5 being very hard, how would you rate this form.

249
00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:28.890
P6: This looks exactly the same. It was a difference.

250
00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:32.679
Hieu: Okay, so you to you, you didn't really notice the difference.

251
00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:37.659
P6: Because we have, like the Federal information. And

252
00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:43.049
P6: I mean, I guess there's no like name on top.

253
00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:46.219
P6: and your own date of birth.

254
00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:47.700
Hieu: Yeah.

255
00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:49.070
P6: Oops.

256
00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:51.400
P6: I'll subscribe.

257
00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:56.810
Hieu: I meant for the scale would be the whole, the whole form, not just this section.

258
00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:59.610
P6: Oh, no, this is the same. Okay.

259
00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:06.170
Hieu: So it's kind of this, the same rating as before, then Gotcha.

260
00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:14.100
Hieu: and then on an efficiency scale of one to 5, 1 being very efficient, and 5 being very inefficient, how would you rate that.

261
00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:17.460
P6: I will still say, too, because it could be improved.

262
00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:20.160
Hieu: Okay. And then, especially with the integration.

263
00:26:20.663 --> 00:26:24.190
P6: Sure it's going to be very hard.

264
00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:27.310
Hieu: Alright, I think that makes sense.

265
00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:37.440
Hieu: and then I'll pause you right there. There's a couple of last question, and then I'll share my screen as well. So what was your overall thought about the 2 prototype? You just went through.

266
00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:42.850
P6: They're very similar. I think I will be fine with either.

267
00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:46.569
Hieu: Okay. So you don't have a strong preference for one or the other.

268
00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:47.020
P6: No.

269
00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:48.610
Hieu: And then.

270
00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:52.309
P6: The second one a little bit better, but otherwise.

271
00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:56.950
Hieu: And then can you oh, can you elaborate on that.

272
00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:05.390
P6: Oh, I think it was just the second one had the separation.

273
00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:08.699
P6: Oh, we need the 1st part

274
00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:12.844
P6: where it was asking about the mailing address.

275
00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:18.639
Hieu: Okay. So you like the page to page separation of the mailing address and the home address.

276
00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:37.386
P6: It's just a little bit better. But I mean ideally, I would like to have like a What's that like a section tab here that will like list what section you're on and what's coming up, and if it's been checked green or like a negative side, that you haven't touched it or not, filled out yet.

277
00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:38.630
Hieu: I got you so.

278
00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:39.190
P6: Asia.

279
00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:41.010
Hieu: So like a task list for you.

280
00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:41.590
P6: Yeah.

281
00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:46.329
Hieu: Things that a checklist of some sort for you to go through as you're doing this.

282
00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:50.290
P6: Yeah. But most of the other websites. If you're filling out data like this, they'll have that

283
00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:52.449
P6: task list on the side.

284
00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:57.589
Hieu: Right. And then can you elaborate on that? Do you have, like a specific example that you have in mind.

285
00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:02.120
P6: Oh, like when I'm doing credentialing at a hospital

286
00:28:02.826 --> 00:28:16.759
P6: they'll have like this list of a what are the schools that you've gone to. What are your previous? I guess, jobs that you've had. You know how the section they'll say your references your section S like

287
00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:19.140
P6: forgot. But they'll have.

288
00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:19.500
Hieu: I got.

289
00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:34.429
P6: List of things, or when you're filling out like your actual credentials, they'll have a list of saying, Hey, you know, this is the credentialing section for procedures. This credentials actually like imaging and like this, is credential, pulmonary or whatnot.

290
00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:35.290
P6: So all sorts.

291
00:28:35.290 --> 00:28:36.090
Hieu: I got you.

292
00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:37.150
P6: Yeah, to fill out.

293
00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:44.579
Hieu: So like a section, a checklist of the sections that you would need to essentially review.

294
00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:48.320
P6: Yeah. And it kind of helps you tell you how far you are in this process.

295
00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:53.860
Hieu: Yeah, okay, that's actually very helpful. And then, is there anything else that you?

296
00:28:54.450 --> 00:28:59.369
Hieu: Is there any other kind of things that you think would help your experience filling out this form.

297
00:28:59.971 --> 00:29:13.830
P6: No, it's just more like that task list. Tell me, or or like a bar that will tell me on top how many, how many more things are left, because this one just says 2 out of 3 household financial information. But I felt like it was more than 2 out of 3.

298
00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:17.880
Hieu: I gotcha. So you want something that's more reflective of the

299
00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:19.879
Hieu: of the process you're going through.

300
00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:21.300
P6: And then the

301
00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:27.428
P6: it's just like you're still, even if you click on next page, you're still not moving kind of this one bar.

302
00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:31.789
Hieu: Understandable. The status bar here is not very helpful for you.

303
00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:32.820
P6: No.

304
00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:37.109
Hieu: Okay, that's okay. That's that's great feedback. Thank you for that.

305
00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:44.369
Hieu: You can stop screen sharing, and then I'll share my own screen and then ask you a few questions in regards to that.

306
00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:46.490
P6: Oh, so how do I start squishing?

307
00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:49.680
Hieu: So. There should be a

308
00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:55.600
Hieu: I think, in your shared option there should be like a stop sharing.

309
00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:58.460
Hieu: It would be located in the same area.

310
00:29:58.770 --> 00:30:02.850
Hieu: There you go, and then I'll share here.

311
00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:10.400
Hieu: And do you see my screen.

312
00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:11.170
P6: Yes.

313
00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:22.300
Hieu: Alright. And let's take a look at these 3 options, each option showing you your personal information in a different way. Can you walk through your thought here, and then do you have a preference for

314
00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:24.190
Hieu: one or the other?

315
00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:33.800
P6: I mean, this one has more bars. So it tells you that there's more steps.

316
00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:38.329
P6: I kind of like this one a little bit more only because it's color differentiated.

317
00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:41.770
Hieu: Can you elaborate on that?

318
00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:45.080
Hieu: Just because it's a different color? So it stands out a little bit more.

319
00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:45.710
Hieu: I got you.

320
00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:54.750
P6: So I guess if I was more visually. This is more bold like, not bold, but it's more stands out more as opposed to this time. Little bar here.

321
00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:59.610
P6: this thin line here. So this is more, hey, you know, pay attention to this.

322
00:31:00.570 --> 00:31:04.079
Hieu: I'm sorry. Are you referring to the the last one? The 3rd one.

323
00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:06.130
Hieu: Okay. So option C.

324
00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:09.909
P6: Yeah, pay more attention to this, because it's kind of highlighted, but not least.

325
00:31:09.910 --> 00:31:11.949
Hieu: Gotcha, and then you don't have

326
00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:20.539
Hieu: okay. They're all fine, but you have a preference for option. C, because the gray box kind of makes it pop, or stands out a little bit.

327
00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:22.780
P6: Yeah. But otherwise, I mean.

328
00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:27.240
P6: I think it also depends on how much information you're trying to put on. This. Put on this.

329
00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:33.579
Hieu: Gotcha alright! That makes sense, and then move on to the next one the

330
00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:36.740
Hieu: marital status. Here we have 2 different options.

331
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.854
P6: Oh, I think either one is fine.

332
00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:45.989
P6: I don't have this review.

333
00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:50.439
Hieu: I gotcha, so you don't have strong preference in one or the other.

334
00:31:51.170 --> 00:31:56.840
P6: People click, people don't click. I mean, if I was an old person I might not know what to click.

335
00:31:57.070 --> 00:32:02.329
P6: but like if I was like an 80 year old. Maybe I wouldn't know how to click. But

336
00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:04.890
P6: let me still wash your color.

337
00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:09.730
Hieu: I gotcha, and then but this is pretty straightforward for you. Nothing

338
00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:35.600
Hieu: dramatic, gotcha, and then, so let's say, in a scenario where you fill out this form before, or just fill it out, and you have it on the marital status as married. But now let's say, for one reason or another. Maybe you fill it out by mistake, or you're coming back to update this, and you want to change it from married to divorce or widow, and you get

339
00:32:36.321 --> 00:32:39.529
Hieu: this kind of you get this message here?

340
00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:44.400
Hieu: And then can you explain to me what this message means to you?

341
00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:47.269
P6: Oh, just delete all my spouse information.

342
00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:48.970
Hieu: Yeah, this, this one.

343
00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:54.290
P6: Yeah, I'll just delete all your like when you change your status, but

344
00:32:54.788 --> 00:32:59.410
P6: from married to something else. So just delete everything that you have about your spams.

345
00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:02.560
Hieu: And then that seems pretty straightforward to you.

346
00:33:02.910 --> 00:33:03.680
P6: Yes.

347
00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:04.610
Hieu: Okay?

348
00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:12.120
Hieu: And then, finally, we have these 2 different comparison here.

349
00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:27.630
P6: I think it's useful to have

350
00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:39.229
P6: this information just so that you can kind of sometimes, you know, like, Oh, did I get earn more money this year versus money and kind of help. You estimate your gross annual income.

351
00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:45.010
Hieu: So you like the the secondary option with the gray box. Reference.

352
00:33:45.010 --> 00:33:47.341
P6: Yeah, because it's also more integrated.

353
00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:49.060
Hieu: I'm sorry.

354
00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:53.859
P6: For my! If they're able to pull my previous income, they should be able to pull my current income.

355
00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:59.259
Hieu: I got you. So it's like one step closer to that integration that you want.

356
00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:00.180
P6: Huh!

357
00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:04.030
P6: Yes.

358
00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:09.609
Hieu: Okay? And then, do you have any kind of opinion, any additional opinion on this or no?

359
00:34:09.889 --> 00:34:10.779
P6: So

360
00:34:11.329 --> 00:34:17.779
P6: no, I mean, this one just has. If your source doesn't have income with the law and 2 0, this one doesn't say the same.

361
00:34:18.419 --> 00:34:22.449
P6: So yeah, I probably would want this one to have the same sentence

362
00:34:22.559 --> 00:34:27.219
P6: in case I didn't have an income that I would know to put a 0. Sometimes you just like.

363
00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:31.609
Hieu: Gotcha. It's just the second one's a little bit clearer in the instructions. Then.

364
00:34:31.610 --> 00:34:32.570
P6: Yes.

365
00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:35.359
Hieu: Gotcha. All right. Thank you for that.

366
00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:43.579
Hieu: and thank you so much for going through that with me. That's it for the prototype. Do you have any questions for me.

367
00:34:44.294 --> 00:34:50.499
P6: No, I mean, I guess. Why would someone want to update their financial information for the Va.

368
00:34:52.420 --> 00:35:07.439
Hieu: I I want to say I think you are at 80%, so it might not be applicable to you. But someone with a lower rating may be required for either copay or travel reimbursements.

369
00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:14.929
Hieu: Okay, yeah. Because I was gonna say, it doesn't make a difference for disability. But well, to my disability benefits. I've never had to update

370
00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:17.749
Hieu: right? It's a little bit unusual for you.

371
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:18.400
P6: Yeah.

372
00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:25.439
Hieu: But if you had to do this for real, it seems like it wasn't an issue for you going through this.

373
00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:32.200
P6: No. And then, when I updated my dependents 2 years ago, it was pretty straightforward, too.

374
00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:36.359
Hieu: Okay, so it has been very straightforward for you.

375
00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:44.469
Hieu: Alright, that's good to know. And then let me see if I, my colleagues, have any additional questions. But besides that, I

376
00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:46.869
Hieu: we can start wrapping it up.

377
00:35:47.620 --> 00:36:00.139
Hieu: I want to circle back here and kind of reconfirm that you are comfortable. If we are to share a video clip of this session with our Va. Partner. You know, if we remove any identifying information.

378
00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:01.290
P6: Correct.

379
00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:04.109
Hieu: Okay, great. And then

380
00:36:04.610 --> 00:36:17.499
Hieu: I want to say, I we really appreciate the time that you know you spent here to go through the prototype and then sharing your thoughts and feedback with us today it's very helpful for us to kind of continue improving the

381
00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:40.269
Hieu: the website for all veterans. And lastly, preaching would like to. We'll be sending you like a Thank you card with a little blurb that you can share with your veteran friends, or with your what sorry a little blurb that you can pass along to other veterans that you may know and would like that would like to participate in future studies.

382
00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:41.529
P6: Hold on!

383
00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:45.339
Hieu: That's it. Thank you, and enjoy the rest of your day.

384
00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:46.480
P6: You, too, have a great day.

385
00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:47.380
Hieu: All right.

386
00:36:47.650 --> 00:36:48.420
P6: Hi.

387
00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:49.240
Hieu: Enjoy.
