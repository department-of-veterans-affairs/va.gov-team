00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:29.900
Hieu: Okay? And then, are you comfortable? Decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with our Va partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you.

P10: Yes.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.130
P10: Yes.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.060
P10: To do my travel reimbursement, and to also refill my medication.

15
00:01:13.391 --> 00:01:15.049
Hieu: Okay, thank you for that.

16
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:44.989
Hieu: And then today you'll be going through 2 prototype. One is an option red and one's an option green. Imagine that you have a spouse and one dependent, and then you may have filled out a similar form before. And now they're asking you to update your financial information in this scenario you logged into your va.gov. Account, where the system has pre-filled some of the information for you in this scenario. Are you comfortable with sharing your screen and talking through your process?

17
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.550
P10: Yes.

18
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.460
Hieu: All right, let me get you a link to the prototype.

19
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.519
Hieu: so I will paste it in the chat.

20
00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:03.650
Hieu: and then what you'll do is, you'll click on that link. And then once you're ready you can share your screen

21
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:16.860
Hieu: and then please close out any kind of personal information like email or Facebook before you share your screen. And then if you let me know if you need any help with this.

22
00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.360
P10: Okay. So it's telling me to join.

23
00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.910
P10: I think it's trying to loaded. Okay.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.179
P10: It's it's coming.

26
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.610
P10: Okay. So how do I share.

27
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:57.819
Hieu: So on your zoom in your zoom window at the bottom of the screen. There! It's a couple of icons, probably at the center of it. It's a green icon that says, share.

28
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.910
P10: Okay, wait a minute. I'm trying to find my zoom window.

29
00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.290
P10: I gotta be still connected because this okay?

30
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.780
P10: So.

31
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.899
Hieu: At the bottom of the zoom. Yep, and then I think you can select, like window or browser.

32
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.380
P10: Okay, zoom share.

33
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:29.900
P10: Am I sharing.

34
00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.949
Hieu: It says, start to share screen. So it's still a black screen for me.

35
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:40.999
Hieu: and I see I see your zoom screen, and then if you can go ahead and and we don't.

36
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.790
P10: To.

37
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.420
Hieu: Go to the.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:51.200
P10: Hello, yeah. Cause I was hoping, okay, let me go.

39
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.930
P10: Oh, right here.

40
00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:56.619
Hieu: I see it.

41
00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:57.199
P10: I don't see that.

42
00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.790
Hieu: Alright. I do see it.

43
00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:01.990
Hieu: And then for this.

44
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.190
Hieu: as you can see. If you click on that, you can go scroll down, up or down.

45
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:14.700
P10: Oh, or right, click on book again.

46
00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:15.150
Hieu: And then.

47
00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.880
P10: I'm moving.

48
00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:25.929
Hieu: Can you maybe hold that screen? And then, like, almost like you're mimicking a touch screen.

49
00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:31.170
P10: Hmm.

50
00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.920
Hieu: Do you have a scroll wheel on your mouse?

51
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.139
P10: Yes, I have the open. Well.

52
00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.900
P10: oh, hold on! I'm not gonna hit an arrow. It says.

53
00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.580
Hieu: No, not the arrow.

54
00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.940
P10: Okay.

55
00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:44.310
Hieu: Nothing.

56
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.850
P10: Oh, okay.

57
00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:45.220
Hieu: No.

58
00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.829
P10: Go back.

59
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.269
Hieu: Go back. Yeah, go back and then see if you can scroll on your wheel.

60
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:53.420
P10: It's.

61
00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.176
Hieu: If not, you can click on this

62
00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.179
Hieu: click on the screen and you can drag it up and and.

63
00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.539
P10: Oh, there we go!

64
00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.149
P10: Yep, they are variety.

65
00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.210
Hieu: So for the 1st part, we'll start with option. Red.

66
00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:11.990
P10: Read, okay.

67
00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.770
Hieu: Yep.

68
00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.069
P10: Yeah, okay.

69
00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:23.340
Hieu: And then please take a few moments to go through this page. I'd like you to think out loud as much as possible, noting anything confusing.

70
00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.669
P10: Okay, let's see what it is.

71
00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:31.419
Hieu: And then I do wanna remind you that in this scenario you are Riley Smith.

72
00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.500
P10: Somewhat. Oh, Riley Smith. Okay.

73
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:35.020
Hieu: Yeah.

74
00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.890
P10: All right.

75
00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:42.549
P10: Okay, alright. So I see my birthday, my social, my birthday.

76
00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:44.180
P10: Okay?

77
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.669
P10: So everything looks correct.

78
00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.380
P10: So would I go to the next page.

79
00:05:52.098 --> 00:05:58.470
Hieu: So you'll continue scrolling down, and then just kind of talk out loud as you're doing this. Anything that.

80
00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:07.610
P10: I already. I'm already at the bottom, and it only showed me my social security number and birth date, and that is correct, and it says if I need to make an update to call the number, but I don't need to. So.

81
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:13.700
Hieu: I gotcha. So you're pretty confident in that. I think you can keep scrolling down.

82
00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:20.170
P10: Okay, I'm at the very end. Oh, oh, no, Matt, okay, alright. So

83
00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:25.089
P10: they saved my request. I don't know what my request was. What was my request.

84
00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.379
Hieu: So that message is a little bit confusing to you.

85
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:38.179
P10: We'll save your application on every change. Okay, maybe it forgot to show me it's not showing me. I made a change. So

86
00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:41.510
P10: this scenario is not showing me. I made a change.

87
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:45.630
Hieu: I gotcha. So the message is slightly confusing. There.

88
00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:47.240
P10: Yeah.

89
00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:48.585
Hieu: Okay.

90
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:51.849
P10: Based on this screen. It is because.

91
00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:52.260
Hieu: Right.

92
00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.079
P10: It should show me that at what change I made.

93
00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.080
Hieu: I gotcha

94
00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:03.450
Hieu: alright. In that case we can move forward. If you scroll up a little bit you'll see the continue button.

95
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.710
P10: Okay, so total.

96
00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:20.579
P10: it tells me to hit like a arrow at the bottom to go to the next frame. That's what you're.

97
00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:27.290
Hieu: Now at in this screen itself you'll see the continue button.

98
00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:31.749
Hieu: So it's just you have to kind of drag the screen

99
00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:34.419
Hieu: down a little bit, and you'll see the.

100
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:39.910
P10: Yeah, that's good, Sydney.

101
00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.810
P10: Okay, alright.

102
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:48.750
P10: it only trying to make me go up, not down.

103
00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:51.240
P10: I mean.

104
00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:51.610
Hieu: The.

105
00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:56.390
P10: Down, so do I need to hit the back, or you said, continue.

106
00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:56.860
Hieu: No.

107
00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:57.740
P10: But inevitable.

108
00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:00.410
Hieu: This would be the same screen, and then.

109
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:05.879
P10: Okay, it won't let me go. It won't let me go up.

110
00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:10.240
Hieu: If if it's difficult for you, maybe I'll do share screen instead.

111
00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:14.580
P10: Okay? Yeah, cause it's not letting me.

112
00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:19.580
P10: It's telling me to hit an arrow to go to the next one at the bottom. It's not let me go back up.

113
00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.929
Hieu: I gotcha give me a few moment while I set up my screen. Then.

114
00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:25.350
P10: Okay.

115
00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:38.529
Hieu: All right. What you can do is you can stop your share screen share.

116
00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:41.150
Hieu: So on your yeah.

117
00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.260
Hieu: Alright.

118
00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:43.020
P10: Okay.

119
00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:48.030
Hieu: And then I will do screen share on my screen instead.

120
00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:05.480
Hieu: So when you use the va.gov, do you usually use the website? Or do you use like a tablet or mobile device.

121
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:07.690
P10: I use my app

122
00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:15.480
P10: cause. That's more convenient and easy, and I don't have to go through all of this. I just click, and I'm there.

123
00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:19.299
Hieu: Sorry use like your app on your phone.

124
00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:20.720
P10: Yes.

125
00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:22.559
Hieu: I see interesting.

126
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:29.359
P10: Because you don't. You don't have to go through all of that, because once you've in, once you have the app, you don't have to keep logging in. You have to keep doing none of that.

127
00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.260
Hieu: Right.

128
00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:31.349
Hieu: I got it.

129
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:32.629
P10: Little click. And you're there.

130
00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:36.579
Hieu: And that's really convenient, and has been working for you.

131
00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:40.250
P10: Oh, yeah, yes, yes, yes, I can do everything.

132
00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:43.589
Hieu: Alright! I have shared my screen. Do you see my screen.

133
00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:44.900
P10: Yes, I do.

134
00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:47.250
Hieu: Alright, so we'll go into option red.

135
00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:54.200
Hieu: And then again, this intro page or this 1st page, you'll see Riley Smith with the.

136
00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:54.900
P10: Yes.

137
00:09:55.260 --> 00:10:06.330
Hieu: Alright. And then you mentioned that the requests are this message in green. Here is a little bit confusing to you because you're not. You don't. You're not quite sure where. What is referring.

138
00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:14.429
P10: Yeah, yes, this scenario. You all left the piece out, because if I made a change it should show the change that I made.

139
00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.980
P10: and I mean because you know.

140
00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:20.040
Hieu: I gotcha alright.

141
00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:20.840
P10: Is missing.

142
00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:21.890
P10: It's it.

143
00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:24.660
Hieu: So let me move on to the next portion.

144
00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:27.740
Hieu: Give me a second here. I need a.

145
00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:28.370
P10: Okay.

146
00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:45.689
Hieu: Alright if I click, continue. And then for this, like I mentioned before in this scenario, this information came from previous information. You've provided for research purposes, you would be going through this form to make sure the fill in is accurate and makes sense.

147
00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:49.320
P10: Okay.

148
00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:56.130
Hieu: So slowly scroll down for you, and then you can talk as you're seeing what or what you're seeing.

149
00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:09.420
P10: Okay, so we got the home address and phone number. So this is updates I've made.

150
00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:13.099
P10: Oh, is it me to verify? That is correct. Okay, I got it.

151
00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:16.109
P10: Okay, cause you would scroll. And I'm like, Hold on, wait, all right.

152
00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:18.630
Hieu: So let me do it slowly.

153
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:26.829
P10: Okay? So the mailing address, the home address and phone. Okay, yeah. So it's saying that I can make changes to it if I needed to.

154
00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:27.730
P10: Yeah.

155
00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:28.210
Hieu: Okay.

156
00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:28.850
P10: Okay.

157
00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:34.860
Hieu: But no problem, no issue at your end. Just quickly look at it, and then.

158
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:36.499
Hieu: Are you guys.

159
00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:42.279
P10: It is asking me to verify. That is correct. Yes or no. Okay, got that, and it is correct.

160
00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:44.680
Hieu: So you'll just continue on. Then.

161
00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:46.200
P10: Okay, yes.

162
00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:56.310
P10: Okay. Now, it's asking me, my marital status okay, all right.

163
00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:03.550
P10: so I would check whatever that is and then hit continue okay, okay, so

164
00:12:08.974 --> 00:12:11.400
P10: pretty much this is like you.

165
00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:20.879
P10: Household reviewing, okay, alright so, yes, that is correct.

166
00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:24.579
P10: So I would hit continue.

167
00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:27.959
Hieu: So you're comfortable with this setup, and then you'll continue.

168
00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:28.820
P10: Yes.

169
00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:29.700
Hieu: Okay.

170
00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:31.199
P10: You got it.

171
00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:42.580
P10: Okay? And then it'll go over to if you have dependents and that okay, all right.

172
00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:49.610
P10: And that's good that it saves as you go. I guess the Ssn, okay.

173
00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:51.530
Hieu: So you like that function.

174
00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:52.750
P10: Yes.

175
00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:59.120
P10: cause anytime your computer may go down or go out or something, and you gotta start all back over. So this eliminates that.

176
00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:00.420
Hieu: I gotcha.

177
00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:02.030
P10: Okay, and then.

178
00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:02.510
Hieu: And then.

179
00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:03.610
P10: Okay.

180
00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:06.309
Hieu: And you're pretty clear on this page. All right.

181
00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:07.090
P10: Yes.

182
00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:09.019
Hieu: So press, continue.

183
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:11.560
P10: Orange.

184
00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:14.719
P10: Then it lists your dependents down there.

185
00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:17.690
P10: Okay, right?

186
00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:19.079
P10: Okay. I got it.

187
00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:24.519
P10: But then they also have it. You can delete them. And if you're finished, you don't want to add anymore.

188
00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:28.089
P10: Okay, yes, pretty straightforward.

189
00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:32.130
P10: Yes, hit continue.

190
00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:39.309
P10: And then do you have income and deductible expenses to earlier.

191
00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:41.960
P10: Yes, it's okay.

192
00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:47.759
P10: Now that is, I would have to like, figure out, what are they talking about?

193
00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:52.489
P10: What income and deductible expenses cause we? We don't add income.

194
00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:54.090
Hieu: Okay, so.

195
00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:57.419
P10: Yeah, if you owe 30%, you don't add income.

196
00:13:57.530 --> 00:13:59.410
Hieu: So I don't know what that is about

197
00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:07.900
Hieu: your for your scenario, or for your own information. If you're over 30%, you would not likely be adding income.

198
00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:12.980
P10: No, they don't do no finance financial for you. If you're over a certain percent.

199
00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:14.070
Hieu: I gotcha.

200
00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:19.710
P10: So I've never. I've never had to add financial information.

201
00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:23.220
Hieu: And then would this question be confusing for you? Then.

202
00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:31.840
P10: Yes, it would be because I would have to find out. Why am I? Well, you know, in my particular case I would never get this screen.

203
00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:38.089
Hieu: Right right? And then, but for this screen you would need more information on why they're asking this information.

204
00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:41.430
P10: Yes, or if I knew that Riley

205
00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:47.220
P10: was already lower than 30%, then I would know then, yeah.

206
00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:49.569
Hieu: You want a little bit more context, then.

207
00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:50.890
P10: Yeah.

208
00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:57.760
Hieu: Okay, that makes sense in this scenario Riley does need to add like financial information.

209
00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:01.160
P10: Okay. So yes, okay. So we'll just continue.

210
00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:02.030
Hieu: Right.

211
00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:16.430
Hieu: And then for this scenario, your you and your spouse's work and salary has not changed from 2,023 to 2,024. So you know, in the previous year you already filled out.

212
00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:17.250
P10: Simple.

213
00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:19.310
Hieu: Information. Now you're coming back.

214
00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:21.980
P10: Right?

215
00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:24.600
P10: Okay.

216
00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:43.069
P10: okay? So you put in your grossing and let out your grossing. So you just put your net in there where it calculates it. I guess. So.

217
00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:44.470
P10: Yeah.

218
00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:51.769
Hieu: Okay? So all the kind of questions and the information has. It's pretty straightforward on this page, for you.

219
00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:57.510
P10: Yes, because if it's incorrect, you did, it's giving you a choice to change it. Okay? So yeah.

220
00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:05.910
Hieu: All right for our purposes. I would just click in here.

221
00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:12.050
Hieu: And then.

222
00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:13.163
P10: Okay, continue,

223
00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:14.630
Hieu: Alright!

224
00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:22.940
P10: Alright. So then, just put here this here some name espousing it.

225
00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:27.319
Hieu: Sorry. What's your thought on the spouse here?

226
00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:30.549
P10: Oh, it will stay the same. Just put the.

227
00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:31.400
Hieu: Okay.

228
00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:31.920
P10: Yeah.

229
00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:44.000
Hieu: And then again, these kind of information is pretty straightforward for you.

230
00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:46.080
Hieu: Nothing out of the ordinary.

231
00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:47.440
P10: No.

232
00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:55.070
P10: and then we'll continue.

233
00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:14.559
P10: Okay, yeah, yeah. So it has the non-reimbursable medical expenses.

234
00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:21.680
P10: And I guess you could click where if it was live. You probably could click that little arrow to see what's considered non reimbursable medical income.

235
00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:24.360
P10: Oh, yeah, you can. Okay, cool.

236
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:26.239
P10: So yeah, that's good.

237
00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:29.520
P10: So I would check that to see if I

238
00:17:30.618 --> 00:17:33.850
P10: had anything that fit that category.

239
00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:40.540
P10: Okay.

240
00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:51.000
Hieu: So this additional information kind of component here is helpful for you.

241
00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:55.279
P10: Yes, the drop down is here is very helpful.

242
00:17:56.310 --> 00:18:00.360
P10: cause you don't want to put the wrong thing in there, and they'd be penalizing me for the wrong stuff.

243
00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:05.180
Hieu: Is that your expectation? If you put wrong information.

244
00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:09.430
P10: Right cause. If you don't know what to put, I mean.

245
00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:12.450
P10: you're either gonna put 0 or

246
00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:18.890
P10: so. That's good. They got what's in what you what's considered non reimbursable, and what's not.

247
00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:28.570
Hieu: Gotcha, then again slowly scroll down to the other portion. Here.

248
00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:38.160
P10: Okay? And it's the same thing. You can click the dropdown and see what's what's

249
00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:41.360
P10: Yeah, what's included in that.

250
00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:43.670
P10: Okay, that's good.

251
00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:44.640
Hieu: Okay?

252
00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:49.549
Hieu: And then in.

253
00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.439
Hieu: I'll put in the information. Here.

254
00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:00.369
Hieu: Now pause here and ask you a couple questions.

255
00:19:01.307 --> 00:19:06.450
P10: So is, was any part of this financial information confusing to you? So far?

256
00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:07.570
P10: No.

257
00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:08.790
Hieu: Okay.

258
00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:09.530
P10: Kind of like.

259
00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:20.109
Hieu: And then, when you saw the 2,023 financial number, did it help you decide what to do next? Or did it make you second, guess your current information.

260
00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:28.450
P10: No, I like. I said I would click the dropdown and see what it, what it included and whatever, and then I would calculate to see if I had changes based on what was.

261
00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:29.719
Hieu: I think that's true.

262
00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:35.069
Hieu: And then in this great box did it help you at all, or you weren't even considering it.

263
00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:37.619
Hieu: This great box here.

264
00:19:38.447 --> 00:19:43.339
P10: If it applied to me, I mean if something was there, and I know that I'm not in school.

265
00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:47.159
P10: and then I would. I would just ignore it and switch it to 0.

266
00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:48.840
Hieu: Gotcha.

267
00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:55.209
Hieu: So I'm sorry. Can you clarify? You think that you can switch this gray box information here.

268
00:19:56.180 --> 00:20:01.479
P10: Oh, no, I would just do the update, because if I know that I'm not in college I shouldn't have an expense.

269
00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:02.380
Hieu: Yeah.

270
00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:03.890
P10: I would just switch it to 0.

271
00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:21.810
P10: I mean, with these, with these screens, people are gonna have to read because they will end up hurting themselves more than helping themselves, because the more income you put in here, the more the Va is gonna use to make your deductible higher, your Copay higher. If you're not at a certain percentage, if you add a certain percentage, none of this applies.

272
00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:32.000
Hieu: Right. And then, if you were had, if you had to do this with real information, would you say you would go through this a lot slower, reading through a lot more carefully. Then.

273
00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:35.320
P10: If it's a if it's a dollar figure there.

274
00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:40.090
P10: Yeah, I would, I was. And then on

275
00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:47.559
P10: I will see what is included in this number that they have, and if it doesn't apply to me, I switch it to 0.

276
00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:49.630
Hieu: Right that makes sense.

277
00:20:50.250 --> 00:21:04.600
Hieu: and then on a scale of one to 5, 1 being very easy and 5 being very hard, how difficult would it be for you to complete this financial information section if you were to do this with real information?

278
00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:06.740
P10: 1, 1.

279
00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:08.260
Hieu: It's a user very easy for you.

280
00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:09.260
P10: Yeah.

281
00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:11.090
Hieu: Okay?

282
00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:15.010
Hieu: And then just no issue at all for you.

283
00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:16.245
P10: No.

284
00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:21.789
Hieu: Okay? And then, do you have any suggestion or feedback for these pages? So far.

285
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:23.740
P10: No.

286
00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:26.989
Hieu: Alright, and then we can continue.

287
00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:42.740
P10: Okay. So now, you basically, just.

288
00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:49.160
P10: I guess reviewing what you already input, cool.

289
00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:55.099
Hieu: Would that be useful to you, or confusing to you?

290
00:21:55.480 --> 00:22:00.790
P10: Oh, yeah, no, it's not confusing. You're just verifying that what you put in is is in there.

291
00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:04.390
Hieu: Gotcha, then continue.

292
00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:06.069
P10: Yes, team.

293
00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:23.420
P10: Okay, so did with this screen is just giving you the option to review, yet again, what you put in there, so

294
00:22:24.189 --> 00:22:30.610
P10: I will skip all this because I did it twice already. So I'm not gonna do it a 3rd time, that's not right.

295
00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:31.440
Hieu: Gotcha.

296
00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:38.770
Hieu: So because you already have, like this minor review one. You don't like to do this whole thing again.

297
00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:44.910
P10: No, I wouldn't do it. I probably would hit the plus to see if it's there, or whatever. But.

298
00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:45.700
Hieu: Yeah.

299
00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:47.499
P10: Yeah, to see if everything is there.

300
00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:48.420
Hieu: Okay.

301
00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:48.750
P10: Hi Joe.

302
00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:51.550
Hieu: But you don't like this because you already review it one time.

303
00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:57.350
P10: Yeah, you already done put it in. Then you reviewed it. Now you're gonna review it again.

304
00:22:57.450 --> 00:22:58.960
P10: Oh, goodness, no!

305
00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:03.659
Hieu: I gotcha, you don't like this this this record this review.

306
00:23:04.770 --> 00:23:09.220
P10: Right you should have put step 3 should have been step 2.

307
00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:14.809
Hieu: I gotcha just less step to go through. Then.

308
00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:16.300
P10: Yeah.

309
00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:25.639
Hieu: And then I do have a question. So let's say, in this scenario, you had an an you input it.

310
00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:40.940
Hieu: And you know, you caught an area because you realized that one of your expenses incorrect, you had a big out of pocket dental operation last year of $3,000. So instead of the, you know, let's say the 5 60 here.

311
00:23:41.418 --> 00:23:48.189
Hieu: It would be $3,000 instead. Would you prefer to fix it here, or one of the previous screens.

312
00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:51.990
P10: Oh.

313
00:23:58.350 --> 00:24:02.239
P10: if this was asked previously, I would have already answered it.

314
00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:03.410
Hieu: Okay.

315
00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:08.790
P10: So I wouldn't do it again if I've already.

316
00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:18.860
Hieu: So in your scenario you would have caught it right in the financial kind of section before getting to this review screen.

317
00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:23.560
P10: Yes, because I've already did the drop down Arrow to see what I need to put in.

318
00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:26.350
Hieu: I got.

319
00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:30.639
P10: So I would I would have already had the 3,000 right there.

320
00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:34.509
P10: But in this scenario is that there? So gotta put it there.

321
00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:42.299
Hieu: Okay, so pretty straightforward for you. But you know, in a real situation, you probably already caught it previously. And

322
00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:45.840
Hieu: and this is just not there.

323
00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:47.639
Hieu: This wouldn't be.

324
00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:51.529
Hieu: This wouldn't be needed essentially for you.

325
00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:53.600
P10: No.

326
00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:54.700
Hieu: Okay.

327
00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:57.990
Hieu: Now, slowly scroll down to the screen. Here.

328
00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:15.689
P10: Okay. So that just confirming that I made the updates and

329
00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:19.699
P10: all that stuff is correct, and I would submit it.

330
00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:35.150
Hieu: Okay? And then on this, you know this overall form. So this whole form that you just went through on the difficulty scale of one to 5, 1 being very easy and 5 being very hard, how would you rate the whole form you just went through?

331
00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:38.179
Hieu: Oh, it's very easy one.

332
00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:38.800
Hieu: Okay?

333
00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:48.100
Hieu: And then on an efficiency scale of one to 5, 1 being very efficient and 5 being very inefficient, how would you rate the whole form? You just went through.

334
00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:50.275
P10: Wait.

335
00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:56.370
P10: It's efficient because you have to do it. If that's you.

336
00:25:57.170 --> 00:26:03.249
P10: whatever I mean, if you fit that category, you have to do it if you're gonna be seen at the Va. So it's not like it's an option.

337
00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:11.919
Hieu: So you're saying that because it's required, but it so it's a required form. But you're saying it's still very efficient for what it is.

338
00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:13.540
P10: Yes.

339
00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:16.340
Hieu: Okay? And then what rating would you give that.

340
00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:18.960
P10: Oh, probably a team.

341
00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:23.250
Hieu: A 2, then can you expand on? Why, it is a 2 for you.

342
00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:38.410
P10: Because it's so much redundancy, and that's like something I cannot stand. I cannot stand redundancy. Tell me what you need, and then, once put it in there and then the next screen verified, and submit all this extra.

343
00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:41.570
Hieu: Okay, yeah, thank you for that feedback.

344
00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:46.940
Hieu: And then I'll end Demo for this portion here

345
00:26:47.730 --> 00:27:05.409
Hieu: and then. So we've just completed the red portion. And now we'll move on to the green. The green option, and in this option some of the screen will be the same, and some will be different, because it's technically a very similar flow. And you're just comparing the 2 options essentially.

346
00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:06.730
P10: Okay.

347
00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:12.879
Hieu: Alright again. This is the you know, the newer flow.

348
00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:17.130
P10: But they'll have similar information. So I'll slowly scroll down for you

349
00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:28.960
P10: okay, verify, okay, the social and birthday, okay, it's correct, so go continue.

350
00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:30.280
Hieu: Okay.

351
00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:42.150
P10: Okay, so just verifying the address is correct.

352
00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:47.460
P10: Okay?

353
00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:52.890
P10: And anyone know if your mailing address and home address is the same or not in this case, no.

354
00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:55.009
Hieu: Okay, and then you'll continue.

355
00:27:56.095 --> 00:28:04.920
P10: Yes, let's say, means giving the other address of the okay.

356
00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:06.820
Hieu: Nothing confusing to you.

357
00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:08.060
P10: Yes.

358
00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:11.429
Hieu: Alright, and then you do. You want to continue.

359
00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:13.300
P10: Yes, I'm sorry.

360
00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:21.759
P10: Okay. Now, I'm checking out my phone and my email, okay, that's correct.

361
00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:25.840
P10: Okay, so then, continue.

362
00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:28.279
Hieu: Okay? And then I'll pause. You right here, real quick.

363
00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:40.299
Hieu: do you prefer reviewing your information page like page to by page like this or the previous option? Where is the card option? Where is the overview.

364
00:28:42.816 --> 00:28:49.150
P10: This. Well, I really don't have a preference as long as I can just do it one time.

365
00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:52.389
Hieu: Okay. So no preference. You don't.

366
00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:54.489
Hieu: When I do it multiple times.

367
00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:55.620
P10: Correct.

368
00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:59.669
Hieu: I wanna do it one time, and I wanna verify one time, and that's it.

369
00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:05.220
Hieu: I gotcha that's fair enough, and then continue here. Then.

370
00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:06.170
P10: Yes.

371
00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:07.230
Hieu: All right.

372
00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:16.570
P10: Okay. So now, quantum, America says, okay, continue.

373
00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:17.690
Hieu: Continue.

374
00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:28.440
P10: Alright. And then that's all that up information pull the PIN all right and okay, continue.

375
00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:29.040
Hieu: Can you.

376
00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:30.300
P10: Now, yes.

377
00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:40.189
P10: okay. And then you have all the information. Okay, continue.

378
00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:49.490
P10: Okay.

379
00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:52.049
P10: Financial support. Okay, continue

380
00:29:55.290 --> 00:30:01.560
P10: and address and phone number. Okay, alright, continue.

381
00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:08.370
P10: Okay? And then this is your dependents. Okay?

382
00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:11.439
P10: Right? I only have one in this particular case. Continue.

383
00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:12.660
Hieu: Right? Okay.

384
00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:13.360
P10: Okay.

385
00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:19.640
Hieu: Alright. We're back to yeah. Income.

386
00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:22.420
P10: Put down back to the income. Right? Okay?

387
00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:25.499
P10: So we will verify that that is correct.

388
00:30:26.290 --> 00:30:27.050
P10: And

389
00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:36.380
P10: yeah, consider, yeah, I would. I would. I would definitely still do the dropdowns, because I want to know what's included and what's not included. So include the wrong amount.

390
00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:39.430
Hieu: Right? So that's something that you double check.

391
00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:40.760
P10: Yes.

392
00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:42.360
Hieu: Gotcha.

393
00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:45.400
P10: Cause. Each year there are changes to stuff.

394
00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:48.000
Hieu: Can you elaborate on that.

395
00:30:48.883 --> 00:31:07.780
P10: Cause maybe one year they want you to include a certain category. And then the next year they don't want to use the category. It's the same thing like taxes, tax taxes change every year what you can claim and what you can't claim. So I don't wanna just take it, you know, for granted that. Oh, they talking about this now click the dropdown to make sure.

396
00:31:08.030 --> 00:31:11.810
Hieu: So you're expecting the category to potentially change from year to year.

397
00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:19.650
P10: I mean, if it applies, I mean, everything else changed year to year, so I don't know, like I say, I don't know, because I've never done this in real life.

398
00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:21.469
P10: because I've never met this.

399
00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:23.410
Hieu: I guess.

400
00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:25.050
P10: Percentage to have to do this.

401
00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:26.420
Hieu: Right, right.

402
00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:27.540
P10: Yeah.

403
00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:34.520
Hieu: Alright so! But in in this scenario no, no kind of nothing too confusing to you.

404
00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:35.429
P10: No,

405
00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:37.250
Hieu: All right.

406
00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:42.540
Hieu: I'll continue on then, same as before. It'll be spouse.

407
00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:44.370
P10: Right? The annual income. Okay.

408
00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:44.710
Hieu: Yeah.

409
00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:52.830
P10: That's yeah. Gross and net. Okay, yep, okay, continue.

410
00:31:57.450 --> 00:32:05.209
P10: Okay. So now we're back to the what the deductible is, I will click the dropdown and see what it's what's considered non reimbursable.

411
00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:11.990
P10: so that I don't add something that I think I is reimbursable. But it's not yeah, okay.

412
00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:14.339
Hieu: I got you.

413
00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:21.729
P10: Yeah, so continuing.

414
00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:23.398
Hieu: A pause. Right here

415
00:32:23.770 --> 00:32:24.300
P10: Okay.

416
00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:30.750
Hieu: So for this prototype there isn't that great box referencing the previous financial information.

417
00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:40.310
Hieu: Oh, is that a was that useful for you before versus now, or it was indifferent for you.

418
00:32:42.707 --> 00:32:47.250
P10: On the other one. You couldn't add anything. You couldn't put an amount there, so I mean

419
00:32:47.850 --> 00:32:50.839
P10: they wanted them out there now, so we gotta put something.

420
00:32:52.690 --> 00:32:53.610
Hieu: I see

421
00:32:54.172 --> 00:33:05.719
Hieu: but so in the previous prototype, there is that gray box where it showed you what you input it before. But now there is. No it didn't have the information.

422
00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:11.650
Hieu: Would that be something that's useful for you? Or that's something or not really.

423
00:33:12.150 --> 00:33:12.970
P10: Nope.

424
00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:15.299
Hieu: And then can you elaborate.

425
00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:19.600
P10: I would just put whatever the amount is. I mean, if I wanted to tell him.

426
00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:21.050
Hieu: Oh, yeah.

427
00:33:24.910 --> 00:33:25.470
P10: Being.

428
00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:26.999
Hieu: And then let's see.

429
00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:34.739
Hieu: So that means, how would you compare this prototype for that financial stuff versus the previous one?

430
00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:44.089
P10: Oh, I think well, I think it was.

431
00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:48.540
P10: Hold on!

432
00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:52.050
P10: Am I the end, or do I have to still keep verifying stuff.

433
00:33:53.867 --> 00:33:57.279
Hieu: So you'll have more pages coming up.

434
00:33:57.750 --> 00:34:00.459
P10: Oh, well, I can't do a comparison if we're not at the end.

435
00:34:00.750 --> 00:34:04.223
Hieu: Okay. So you wanna continue before you do a

436
00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:10.999
P10: Yeah, because so far, right now, the only difference is the funerals blocked. I mean, everything else is still the same.

437
00:34:12.370 --> 00:34:28.619
Hieu: I gotcha, and then for the financial portion itself, then on a scale of one to 5, 1 being very easy and 5 being very hard. How would it be for you to complete this financial information if you were to do this with real information?

438
00:34:29.739 --> 00:34:31.519
P10: One. It's the same.

439
00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:31.880
Hieu: It's.

440
00:34:31.889 --> 00:34:32.319
P10: Yes.

441
00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:33.840
Hieu: Still very easy to you.

442
00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:34.820
P10: Yeah.

443
00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:36.820
Hieu: Gotcha move on, then.

444
00:34:38.090 --> 00:34:41.639
Hieu: So again, this is the review page here.

445
00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:45.370
Hieu: And then.

446
00:34:45.370 --> 00:34:48.719
P10: Okay. So you still gotta go through the same thing all over again.

447
00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:50.510
P10: Okay, you just don't know.

448
00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:50.840
P10: I'm.

449
00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:51.690
Hieu: Portion.

450
00:34:52.139 --> 00:34:57.179
P10: No, I'm missing something. I'm trying to see. What's the difference between the red and the green. Just the funeral part.

451
00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:00.929
Hieu: There's a couple of minor differences.

452
00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:04.299
P10: Yeah, cause this is this is all still doing the same thing. I mean.

453
00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:07.719
Hieu: I gotcha, but so to you. It's very similar in both. Then.

454
00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:14.180
P10: Yeah, I don't like night. I don't like neither.

455
00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:18.940
Hieu: Alright, that's fair. And is it because of this? Redundant.

456
00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:22.179
P10: Yes, yes, I just can't do it.

457
00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:23.610
Hieu: Gotcha.

458
00:35:23.610 --> 00:35:29.189
P10: I will skip over. I would skip over all of that and hit submit, because.

459
00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:29.650
Hieu: Okay.

460
00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:32.330
Hieu: And then for.

461
00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:35.540
P10: Time is valuable to me, and wasteful time.

462
00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:39.840
Hieu: For this whole entire thing, then would it be

463
00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:47.489
Hieu: on a difficulty scale on this entire form, for one being very easy and 5 being very hard. How would you rate this.

464
00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:49.720
P10: Oh, it's easy one.

465
00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:51.359
Hieu: One. Okay? And then efficient.

466
00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:52.340
Hieu: No.

467
00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:57.370
P10: Yeah. It's just let's do.

468
00:35:57.730 --> 00:36:00.390
Hieu: A 2 same thing. Now, -

469
00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:09.460
Hieu: you're saying that basically your your major pain point is that it's very redundant to you. You'd rather have something even simpler than this.

470
00:36:10.290 --> 00:36:11.300
P10: Yes.

471
00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:13.449
Hieu: Okay, that is fair.

472
00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:18.019
P10: But that's how good it is. It ain't gonna change. It'll still be all this stuff.

473
00:36:19.515 --> 00:36:25.370
Hieu: Do you have a preference between the 2 prototype, or is feels very similar to you.

474
00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:27.130
P10: Very similar.

475
00:36:27.390 --> 00:36:28.220
Hieu: Okay?

476
00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:35.259
Hieu: And then, besides the redundancy is there anything you changed about the whole form? If you could.

477
00:36:36.450 --> 00:36:38.990
P10: I would. I would only do. Step

478
00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:44.330
P10: step 3 would not be the same as step 2. I mean you already done, did it?

479
00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:48.050
P10: So now you gotta go back and review it again.

480
00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:52.230
Hieu: Okay, and you just don't like the review portion of Step 3. Then.

481
00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:53.620
P10: No.

482
00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:54.950
Hieu: Gotcha.

483
00:36:56.360 --> 00:37:00.990
Hieu: Let me take a few different kind of.

484
00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:08.100
Hieu: I'll switch over to a different screen here, where you can compare different visuals, and then.

485
00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:08.850
P10: Okay.

486
00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:11.470
Hieu: So can you see this.

487
00:37:11.830 --> 00:37:15.180
P10: Yes, I can. Now I can. Now, yeah, yes.

488
00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:28.560
Hieu: Alright. So in this page here you have 3 different options showing your personal information in different way. Can you walk me through your preference here, and which one would you like, which one you like best? And why.

489
00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:35.979
P10: Okay, I'm trying to. Okay. One says Review. The other 2 says Confirm.

490
00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:39.659
P10: but it's the same thing. So what what am I doing? What am I supposed to be doing?

491
00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:42.034
Hieu: You're looking at these 3 different

492
00:37:43.090 --> 00:37:54.000
Hieu: way that your information is displayed, and then kind of talk me through think out loud and talk me through what's going through your mind, and which one do you like best visually.

493
00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:56.520
P10: Oh, visually.

494
00:37:57.180 --> 00:38:01.360
P10: Oh, cause I'm about to say say the same thing, so I mean I don't get it.

495
00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:05.889
P10: Well, one got 3 steps and one got 5, 2 got 5 steps.

496
00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:10.090
P10: Oh, my gosh, this is crazy!

497
00:38:14.010 --> 00:38:16.639
P10: I would probably do. Welsea.

498
00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:18.420
P10: Oh, no!

499
00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:22.880
P10: Well, I definitely don't want no more steps, so I'll definitely go with the 1st one.

500
00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:23.670
Hieu: So it it

501
00:38:24.010 --> 00:38:30.969
Hieu: in terms of steps. You'll definitely like the less the lesser. What do you call it? Progression ones?

502
00:38:31.690 --> 00:38:40.020
P10: Yes, the lesser steps, because it's not just, for you have to realize you have elderly veterans. They got to do this. This is too much.

503
00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:40.870
Hieu: Right.

504
00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:42.769
P10: It's too much for them.

505
00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:47.900
Hieu: And then, in terms of how your personal information is displayed. Do you have a preference for which one.

506
00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:54.750
P10: No, because they're displayed the same. It's just that one is in a bigger font.

507
00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:59.890
Hieu: So same information to you, indifferent, really, on which option you like.

508
00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:11.249
P10: Right, because all all 3 options say the exact same thing in the exact same order.

509
00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:14.089
P10: So what am I comparing?

510
00:39:15.710 --> 00:39:21.360
P10: It's got the name, the social security number, and the date of birth on all 3 in the exact same way.

511
00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:25.829
P10: It's just one guy, 2 got more steps than the other one.

512
00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:28.530
P10: but it's the it's the same thing. It's no difference.

513
00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:32.170
Hieu: So in your case.

514
00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:34.470
P10: And one says to review.

515
00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:38.720
P10: But like I said, I'm not going with them 5 steps. So that's out.

516
00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:45.249
Hieu: Right, I gotcha, but in terms of the visual difference, it's indifferent for you.

517
00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:50.089
P10: Okay, maybe I'm missing something, cause I don't see a visual difference.

518
00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:57.599
Hieu: Like it looks different in terms of how the information is displayed, not the actual information itself.

519
00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:04.259
P10: One is smaller. It's only it's only different in the front. I mean, the front is smaller. So

520
00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:08.880
P10: I'm trying to figure out, what am I missing?

521
00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:10.650
Hieu: I'm I'm showing the

522
00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:17.150
Hieu: the personal information here. It has the blue bar, a box and a gray box. But for

523
00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:21.659
Hieu: oh, okay. So the Green Box. You can't change, but the other 2 is totally out. So it's whatever one got.

524
00:40:22.530 --> 00:40:27.379
Hieu: I gotcha, because you're thinking that the great box is not something that you cannot change.

525
00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:27.910
Hieu: Very good.

526
00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:29.030
P10: Correct.

527
00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:29.560
Hieu: Gotcha.

528
00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:39.689
P10: What you shouldn't, and in most apps that you go on, you cannot change your birthday and your social security number, because it should already be correct. That's something you just can't change, because people other people can go in there and just change it.

529
00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:43.890
Hieu: But in in your should be grayed out on all of them.

530
00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:47.139
Hieu: I gotcha, but you don't really have.

531
00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:47.800
P10: Right.

532
00:40:49.650 --> 00:40:59.170
Hieu: And then for your your your personal preference. You don't really have a preference for either one of how this display here. It's all the same to you. Then.

533
00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:10.790
P10: Yeah, except like I said, it should be grayed out on all of them, because you should not be able to change your social security number, and you should not be able to change your birthday cause. Those 2 things do not change in life.

534
00:41:10.930 --> 00:41:14.939
P10: So most most things. You cannot change those 2.

535
00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:20.549
Hieu: All right. We'll move on to the next portion, then.

536
00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:24.419
Hieu: and this is the marital status. One.

537
00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:26.040
P10: Okay.

538
00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:29.749
Hieu: Between A and B. Do you have a preference.

539
00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:32.520
P10: Drop down in a bubble. I don't care which one.

540
00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:33.060
Hieu: You know.

541
00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:33.630
P10: Yeah. Man.

542
00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:34.850
Hieu: All right.

543
00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:40.069
Hieu: Nope, Nope, preference for one or the other. Really.

544
00:41:42.320 --> 00:42:01.465
Hieu: Okay. And then let's say, in this scenario your marital status was married and you input it information in there and then, you know, in the future you came back, and maybe you're divorced or widow. So you change it from married to divorce. And then you see this message here. Can you?

545
00:42:02.010 --> 00:42:06.249
Hieu: walk me through this message and then change your meriting status.

546
00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:09.240
P10: Okay, changing your marital status.

547
00:42:10.210 --> 00:42:18.130
P10: changing your status to marital status will delete any previous spouse information in this form change anymore.

548
00:42:19.850 --> 00:42:26.260
Hieu: So in this scenario, let's say in it would be divorce. Change your status to divorce.

549
00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:30.280
P10: We'll delete any previous.

550
00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:35.820
P10: That's good. That's what you want to do. You want to delete them. If you ain't with them, you divorce them, delete them.

551
00:42:36.410 --> 00:42:40.670
Hieu: Okay. So your expectation of that is that

552
00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:45.490
Hieu: this would delete any information you previously filled out. Then.

553
00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:51.360
P10: Yes, just your spouse information on that. Not all your information, just your spouse information.

554
00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:54.629
Hieu: Okay, and that this message is pretty clear to you. Then.

555
00:42:54.990 --> 00:42:55.920
P10: Yes.

556
00:42:57.020 --> 00:42:57.920
Hieu: Gotcha?

557
00:42:59.630 --> 00:43:00.380
Hieu: Alright, yeah.

558
00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:03.770
P10: That's a good message, because you want to delete them so that you don't have to be getting

559
00:43:04.110 --> 00:43:07.240
P10: pay for them and have to pay the Va back.

560
00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:08.730
P10: Yeah, it's good.

561
00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:16.390
Hieu: And then finally back to this financial information here A and B with kind of

562
00:43:16.750 --> 00:43:21.890
Hieu: B being having that great box, and then A does not have that.

563
00:43:23.620 --> 00:43:25.390
Hieu: What's your thought on the 2.

564
00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:31.290
P10: Okay, one is for your spouse, and I don't. I don't know what the 1st one is for.

565
00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:32.140
P10: Entity is.

566
00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:34.240
Hieu: So scenario.

567
00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:35.319
P10: That's what you spelled.

568
00:43:35.570 --> 00:43:38.019
Hieu: Yeah, they're both the same.

569
00:43:38.310 --> 00:43:40.500
Hieu: Do you have a preference for one or the other?

570
00:43:41.310 --> 00:43:42.610
P10: Oh.

571
00:43:47.570 --> 00:43:55.350
P10: one, yeah. Just go ahead. Only just put. Yeah. Just put in what's current. I mean, you don't I? I don't care what was there last year.

572
00:43:55.350 --> 00:43:56.760
Hieu: Okay. Yeah.

573
00:43:57.470 --> 00:44:01.200
P10: So then I ain't got to try to figure out stuff. Just put in what it is.

574
00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:07.300
Hieu: Would that be confusing to you for having, like last year's information? Now you just don't want it.

575
00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:10.350
P10: And it doesn't matter to me

576
00:44:13.290 --> 00:44:18.570
P10: whether it's in there or not, cause I'm gonna put in what's for whatever year I'm doing, regardless.

577
00:44:18.750 --> 00:44:25.400
Hieu: I gotcha alright, and I think that's it for the prototype.

578
00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:27.200
Hieu: And then let me see.

579
00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:33.889
P10: Because I have. I have. I have a power attorney for my father, who's elderly, was in

580
00:44:34.070 --> 00:44:39.699
P10: long time ago. War and I have to do this. I have to do this, and I don't even look at

581
00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:44.870
P10: I don't. I don't care about what's already in there. I put what's in there. What's he? What pertains to him now?

582
00:44:46.510 --> 00:44:47.640
Hieu: I guide you

583
00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:57.059
Hieu: now? Besides, the kind of redundancy thing that you didn't like with the review screen. Was there anything else that you would

584
00:44:57.671 --> 00:45:01.200
Hieu: like to to have on the overall flow.

585
00:45:03.630 --> 00:45:07.059
P10: It's enough day already. It's too much day already. So.

586
00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:10.830
Hieu: Alright! Too much for for your purposes. Then.

587
00:45:12.550 --> 00:45:16.420
P10: Glad I don't have to do it in real life. Well, for my dad, I do but

588
00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:19.640
P10: it's okay.

589
00:45:20.250 --> 00:45:28.560
Hieu: And then I'll see if I have. If my colleagues have any questions. But besides that do you have any questions for me so far?

590
00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:30.160
P10: No.

591
00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:43.140
Hieu: Alright. So I want to circle back and then reconfirm that you are comfortable. If we were to share a video clip of the session with our Va. Partner. After we remove any identifying information.

592
00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:44.930
P10: Yes.

593
00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:49.800
Hieu: Alrighty. Thank you. And then so

594
00:45:50.340 --> 00:46:02.539
Hieu: I just want to say that we really appreciate you taking your time and share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback will be very helpful as we continue to work on the website and making sure it works for all veterans.

595
00:46:02.650 --> 00:46:16.209
Hieu: And then, lastly, Perigin will be sending you a thank you. Note with a little blurb, that you can pass along to other veterans, you may know to provide them with a chance to participate in future research as well.

596
00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:18.240
P10: Okay.

597
00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:23.260
Hieu: And then, you know, thank you again. Enjoy the rest of your day and your vacation. Really.

598
00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:24.620
P10: Okay. Thank you.

599
00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:26.679
Hieu: Alright! Thank you, enjoy.

600
00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:27.290
P10: Okay.
