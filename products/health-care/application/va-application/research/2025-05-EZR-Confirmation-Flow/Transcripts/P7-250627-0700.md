1
00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.989
Hieu: So I have started recording. I'd like to confirm that you are comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today.

2
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.740
P7: Yes.

3
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:18.720
Hieu: Alrighty. And then I want to confirm that you are comfortable. We decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other Va partners.

4
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.380
P7: Yes.

5
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.330
Hieu: Alrighty. Thank you. All right.

6
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:30.729
Hieu: So let's jump into this. So a couple warm-up questions. Do you have service-connected disability rating at the Va.

7
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:31.760
P7: Yes, sir.

8
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.240
Hieu: And then what would be that rating.

9
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.420
P7: The percentage or.

10
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.660
Hieu: Yeah, the percentage.

11
00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:38.569
P7: 100.

12
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.790
Hieu: 100, all right. And then have you recently visited the va.gov website?

13
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:45.680
P7: Yes.

14
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.820
Hieu: And then may I ask, for what reason?

15
00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.879
P7: I filed a claim to add a dependent. So I'm checking the status.

16
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.300
Hieu: Okay.

17
00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:13.370
Hieu: all right. Thank you. So for today you'll be going through 2 different prototypes. One is option red and the other one's option green for this scenario. Imagine that you have a spouse and one dependent you may. You may have filled out a similar.

18
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:30.370
Hieu: a similar form before now they're asking you to update your financial information in this scenario. You have logged into your va.gov account, where the system has pre-filled some of the information for you, and then for this scenario. Are you comfortable with sharing your screen and talking through your process?

19
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.100
P7: Sure.

20
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.319
Hieu: All right. So what I'll do is I'll give you a link to our prototype

21
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:44.470
Hieu: and then get you set up on that, and you can. So I have linked a

22
00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.839
Hieu: the prototype in chat.

23
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.569
Hieu: If you can see that click on that.

24
00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.490
Hieu: and then, once it's loaded, you know, please make sure to close any personal information you have on

25
00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.620
Hieu: the same browser, like email or Facebook. And then once you're ready, you can screen share.

26
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.110
Hieu: and then let me know if you need help. With that.

27
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.039
P7: Okay, yes. Screen. Share is.

28
00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.389
Hieu: The zoom window at the bottom.

29
00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:18.519
Hieu: and then, if you're in on a computer, it should be like a bunch of icons at the bottom.

30
00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.040
P7: Yep.

31
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.050
Hieu: Yep, and then you can choose, like browser, which browser to to share.

32
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.590
P7: Cool.

33
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.349
P7: I don't wanna record. I want to share the screen.

34
00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.680
Hieu: So that would be that green button.

35
00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.520
P7: Yes.

36
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.440
Hieu: Okay. You see, you do see it.

37
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.140
P7: Yeah, I I click on it.

38
00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.920
P7: Okay, it's showing me. Yes, system picker.

39
00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:10.360
Hieu: Oh!

40
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.170
P7: Access the screen and audio.

41
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.520
Hieu: So I see your whole desktop. You can.

42
00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:26.730
Hieu: perhaps, if you click that. Yes, you I believe you can. You have to allow that.

43
00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:28.370
P7: Okay.

44
00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:34.719
Hieu: But for this might be too much. But if you want to full size that that's okay, too.

45
00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.660
P7: Close this maximize, that.

46
00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.050
Hieu: Yeah, is that is that comfortable for you?

47
00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.939
P7: That's fine. Yeah.

48
00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.200
Hieu: Okay, great

49
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:50.999
Hieu: So for this demo, we'll start with the green option. So if you click on the green button there.

50
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.970
Hieu: Yes, so

51
00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:03.479
Hieu: please take a few moments to go through this page. I'd like you to think out loud as much as possible, noting anything that's confusing.

52
00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.490
P7: Okay, do we have.

53
00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.720
Hieu: And then in this scenario you are Riley Smith.

54
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.159
P7: Yeah. Yeah. I mentioned that. Yes.

55
00:04:20.346 --> 00:04:22.130
P7: No, that's pretty straightforward.

56
00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.890
Hieu: Okay?

57
00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.089
Hieu: And then, if that's pretty straightforward for you, please go ahead. Click, continue to move on.

58
00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:41.629
Hieu: And then, as I mentioned before in this scenario. This information came from previous information. You provided for research purposes. You would be going through this form to make sure the fill in are accurate and make sense.

59
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.900
P7: Okay.

60
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.059
P7: prefilled some info. Okay, I don't live on a military base outside the Us.

61
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.949
P7: States. Address one, address, 2. City.

62
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.299
P7: Yeah. No. Again, that's that's pretty straightforward.

63
00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.440
Hieu: Okay, then we can continue.

64
00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.300
P7: Oh, this went back to page one.

65
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.810
P7: Were, was that the page we were just on the previous page was that one of 3.

66
00:05:25.527 --> 00:05:26.770
Hieu: That was also one of 3.

67
00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.230
P7: Oh, okay, or are these just different layouts of the same thing?

68
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:38.700
Hieu: Yeah. So is that a little bit confusing to you? Since you read the one as like a page, one of 3.

69
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.290
P7: I was thinking, yes, that this should be

70
00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:52.200
P7: now 3 of 3, right, because the 1st one was was giving me the information. The next one was. I was verifying all this information, and now this one should be the 3rd one.

71
00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:59.240
Hieu: I say so. You're reading the one up there as it should be like a page thing instead of just a 1 of the I gotcha.

72
00:06:01.942 --> 00:06:05.099
P7: But this, this is just the same page that I was previously on.

73
00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.710
Hieu: I don't see anything new on here.

74
00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:08.860
Hieu: I gotcha.

75
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:15.159
P7: Okay, yeah, that's I mean other than that. Yeah, it's pretty straightforward.

76
00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.990
Hieu: Okay, then we can move on.

77
00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:29.840
P7: Okay, I see one is is the veteran information. So there's gonna be a part 2 that's going to be some other kind of information or whatever, and 3 will be something else

78
00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.410
P7: for the email.

79
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.040
P7: Yeah.

80
00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.760
Hieu: Alright, straightforward again.

81
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.739
Hieu: Yeah, continue on.

82
00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:50.409
P7: Okay. Household financial. I see. Now that makes sense. The the 1, 2, 3,

83
00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.520
P7: very.

84
00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:57.189
P7: Oh, yeah. Okay.

85
00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:00.849
Hieu: No issues as well. All right.

86
00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:02.339
Hieu: Move along.

87
00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:18.990
P7: Yeah, those are straightforward questions.

88
00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:21.240
Hieu: Okay, continue.

89
00:07:26.353 --> 00:07:31.870
P7: Yes. No. Okay. Currently have the same address. No.

90
00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:33.870
P7: Okay.

91
00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:36.590
Hieu: Okay, go ahead.

92
00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:38.300
P7: What's that?

93
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:39.779
Hieu: I just said, Go ahead.

94
00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:40.549
P7: Oh, okay.

95
00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:49.940
P7: It says, financial support.

96
00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:51.640
P7: Okay.

97
00:07:52.383 --> 00:07:56.049
Hieu: These aren't the answers I'd be choosing. But yes, I I.

98
00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:58.280
P7: It's easy enough to follow.

99
00:07:58.470 --> 00:07:59.440
Hieu: Gotcha.

100
00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:07.010
P7: Health benefits. Information spouse's address.

101
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:12.319
P7: City. Yeah, yes, that that's straightforward stuff.

102
00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:14.090
Hieu: Alrighty! Move on!

103
00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:25.070
P7: Okay.

104
00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:26.979
Hieu: No no issues here as well.

105
00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:28.620
P7: No, no.

106
00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:29.350
Hieu: Okay.

107
00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:32.739
P7: Again. It's it's pretty straightforward.

108
00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:45.310
Hieu: Yeah, sounds good for this one. I'll give you financial information you'll need. So for this scenario, you and your spouse's work and salary has not changed from 2,023 to 2,024.

109
00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:59.750
Hieu: And then, if this is a real scenario, or if this is a real situation. You would need to find these information from, you know, either your W. 2 or kind of any expense you accumulated over the year.

110
00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:01.160
P7: Okay.

111
00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:08.490
Hieu: And then in, you know, in our scenario, you would just have this information that you gather already, one way or another.

112
00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:17.969
Hieu: and then, because this is a demo, you can't technically type in anything. But once you press on the input input area.

113
00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:22.669
Hieu: the system will automatically put the system put the numbers for you.

114
00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:29.159
P7: Okay, okay, do these dropdowns for what we consider gross annual income? Do those work.

115
00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:29.930
Hieu: Yes.

116
00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:31.050
P7: Okay. May I?

117
00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:31.730
Hieu: Yes.

118
00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:34.140
P7: Okay.

119
00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:41.350
P7: okay? And then just click in here.

120
00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:41.710
Hieu: Yes.

121
00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:43.979
P7: As if I were going to put the info in.

122
00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:44.950
Hieu: Absolutely.

123
00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.540
P7: Oh, there we go. Okay.

124
00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:59.240
P7: The foreign property business. Okay.

125
00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:04.240
P7: Other income. What is that? Retirement benefits unemployment benefit?

126
00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:17.950
P7: Alright. Yeah. Again, that seems pretty straightforward, and you have the explanations of what you consider the additional, or, you know, monies

127
00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:18.869
P7: coming in.

128
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:19.520
Hieu: Right?

129
00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:21.769
Hieu: Okay, so you can move along.

130
00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:29.030
P7: I imagine the same. Yeah. Okay for the spouse.

131
00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:37.290
P7: Other.

132
00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:41.350
P7: Yeah. Again, straightforward.

133
00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:41.960
Hieu: Yeah.

134
00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:46.080
P7: Deductible expenses.

135
00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:50.900
P7: See?

136
00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:55.750
P7: Oh, okay.

137
00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:00.110
P7: So that's something that you may have to have figured out already.

138
00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:05.569
Hieu: Right. And then would that take you a while? If you're doing this with real information.

139
00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:12.220
P7: If if I were doing this. Yes, I I think I would keep this separate from my

140
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:18.119
P7: tax information like, if I had my W. Twos. This would not be something I necessarily keep with that, unless it was

141
00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:24.429
P7: part of the whole package that something I already wrote off, or I was using.

142
00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:24.920
Hieu: Yeah.

143
00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:28.800
P7: You know, if if you do the 1040 easy form for taxes

144
00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:33.980
P7: you, you don't do a lot of deductions. It's just the, you know, this is my income. This is whatever

145
00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:37.480
P7: the maximum amount you can get is. And so right.

146
00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:40.310
P7: have an itemized list like this might take some time

147
00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:43.560
P7: if it wasn't something that you, you know.

148
00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.219
Hieu: Already done for something else.

149
00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:46.000
P7: Yes.

150
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.470
Hieu: Okay, that makes sense.

151
00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:51.810
Hieu: And then this, it's relatively easy to you. But it will just take some time.

152
00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:57.200
P7: Yeah, to gather that information if it wasn't on your on your tax form from the previous year. Yes.

153
00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:57.840
Hieu: Gotcha.

154
00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:58.890
P7: And and again.

155
00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:05.450
P7: the easy form versus, you know, actually doing deductions and having a tax person go through all that stuff for you.

156
00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.230
Hieu: Yeah, that makes sense.

157
00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:14.390
P7: Okay, college vocation, educational expenses.

158
00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:21.629
P7: Okay? Well, again, that's that's something that you may or may not have put on your taxes. I know it's something you can write off.

159
00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:25.740
P7: But if you're just doing the easy form you may have bypassed that.

160
00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:28.979
P7: you know, so you may have to look for this information.

161
00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:39.919
P7: Oh, I didn't know. That was something that

162
00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:44.200
P7: I suppose you could track that as well. But okay

163
00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:55.450
P7: again, pretty straightforward. But unless you already know that you're going to be collecting, you know. Specifically this information. You may have to stop the process and go grab other documents.

164
00:12:55.660 --> 00:13:01.979
Hieu: Right. So you see, for the most part straightforward. But this area, this portion, might take some time.

165
00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:07.909
P7: Yeah, if you didn't know specifically that you're gonna need, you know, non reimbursable medical.

166
00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:13.150
P7: you know, school expenses and burial funeral kind of stuff for the family.

167
00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:19.429
Hieu: That makes sense. And then, was any part of this financial information confusing to you.

168
00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.359
P7: No, no, not confusing.

169
00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:37.980
Hieu: Okay, and then on a scale of one to 11 being very easy and 5 being very hard, how would you rate the difficulty. How how difficult would it be for you to complete this financial information section if you were to do this with real information.

170
00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:48.739
P7: Maybe a 2 or 3 very, very relatively easy. But again, you know, the fact that you'd have to stop and go get additional information would would add to the challenge.

171
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.489
Hieu: Absolutely that makes sense that makes sense.

172
00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:53.570
Hieu: And then you can continue on.

173
00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:59.399
P7: Okay, 3 of 3. Review, your information.

174
00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:18.979
P7: Okay, oops. Oh, that's not the back, I wanted, I wanted the

175
00:14:24.277 --> 00:14:26.569
Hieu: You wanted the review thing to collapse.

176
00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:28.910
P7: Yes, there we go.

177
00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.180
P7: Household information.

178
00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:40.529
P7: You can edit the information that you put in

179
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:58.460
Hieu: So in this scenario you realize that one of your expense is incorrect. You had a big out of pocket dental operation last year for $3,000. How would you fix that error.

180
00:15:05.432 --> 00:15:08.889
P7: I would click on this edit for expenses.

181
00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:10.869
Hieu: Gotcha change the amount.

182
00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:19.969
Hieu: and then would it be easier for you to do the edit here, or was it going back to do it on the deductible page.

183
00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:27.460
P7: I think it would be easier here. You know, you're right here reviewing the information, and you could change it as needed.

184
00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:28.730
Hieu: Right.

185
00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:30.170
P7: While you're reviewing it.

186
00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:35.009
Hieu: I gotcha. So this is a pretty good place for you to to do that, and edit that.

187
00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:35.680
P7: Yes.

188
00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:37.030
Hieu: Gotcha.

189
00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:46.389
Hieu: and then on a difficulty of one to 5, 1 being very easy and 5 being very hard, how would you rate the whole form that you just went through.

190
00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:48.040
P7: The entirety of it.

191
00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:48.770
Hieu: Yes.

192
00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.100
P7: a 1.

193
00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.040
Hieu: One.

194
00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:52.470
P7: Yeah.

195
00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:55.710
Hieu: Okay, so like, you mentioned very straightforward.

196
00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:56.350
P7: Yes.

197
00:15:56.620 --> 00:16:06.739
Hieu: Okay? And then on an efficiency scale of one to 5, 1 being very efficient and 5 being very inefficient, how would you rate the entire form that you just went through.

198
00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:17.339
P7: I'll give it a 2 again, because the information you may not know you need to have right here with you for this, you know, and you may have to stop and go get additional information.

199
00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:22.049
Hieu: Right especially you're referring to the deductible or the expense portion.

200
00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:22.750
P7: Yes.

201
00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:33.099
Hieu: Okay, cause. It seems like, for the at least for the spouse and the veteran portion of the income. You'll have that readily available.

202
00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:39.539
P7: We? Yes, at at the beginning you mentioned it's going to be you're you're putting in your

203
00:16:40.956 --> 00:16:42.570
P7: financial information.

204
00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:43.200
Hieu: Right.

205
00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:43.970
P7: So

206
00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:55.260
P7: me when I hear financial information, I think, okay, I know I have to have my W 2 forms and stuff related to my retirement and investments and things like that. I wouldn't necessarily think of, you know, medical deductions

207
00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:58.499
P7: and school deductions.

208
00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:02.600
Hieu: Right? I see. Okay, that makes sense. Yeah, thank you for that feedback.

209
00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:08.809
Hieu: And then if you scroll to the bottom here, we'll end this portion of the demo. So if you press the.

210
00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:12.940
P7: Scroll down some more. Yep, right there, and demo end demo. Okay.

211
00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:13.550
Hieu: Yeah.

212
00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:23.499
Hieu: So now that we just complete the green option, we'll move on to the red option. And in this option some of the screens will be the same, and some of it will be different.

213
00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:24.359
P7: Okay.

214
00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:27.070
P7: And then.

215
00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:30.009
Hieu: And again. I'd like you to review and then talk out loud.

216
00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.620
P7: No, that looks pretty easy, straightforward.

217
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:39.000
Hieu: Okay.

218
00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:55.156
P7: Yeah, that's again straightforward. It's stuff that you've already submitted to the Va. That you know you have on file.

219
00:17:55.760 --> 00:18:01.469
Hieu: Yeah. Now, do you prefer this overview option or the detail one in the previous green option.

220
00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:04.629
P7: Can I look back.

221
00:18:05.592 --> 00:18:18.210
Hieu: Do you know this screen? Right here? I'm saying I'm asking, do you prefer this option which has the overview? Or do you prefer the detail page to page one in option. Green.

222
00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:23.069
P7: Oh, where I had to go in, and where everything was each individual line that you could edit as you were

223
00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:27.999
P7: for me. This is easier it again. It's already stuff that you already have. It's nothing

224
00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:33.540
P7: that I should necessarily be updating the standard information. Anyway.

225
00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:39.670
Hieu: Gotcha. So because you already provided having this overview is better for you.

226
00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:40.480
P7: Yes.

227
00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:46.249
Hieu: Okay, this this is stuff that you put in when you 1st create a Va account.

228
00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:56.989
P7: va.gov account. So this is again, unless you moved, or something, or, you know, got a new phone. This is not going to change. So yes, I this this would be easier.

229
00:18:57.190 --> 00:19:00.780
Hieu: Okay, I gotcha. That makes sense, and then you can continue on.

230
00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:09.140
P7: Yeah.

231
00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:14.900
P7: And I think this is something that could change that you might not think about updating. So if you give it this option right here

232
00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:16.910
P7: that makes sense as well.

233
00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:17.850
Hieu: Okay.

234
00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:32.820
P7: Well.

235
00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:41.080
P7: now, maybe with the previous screen, if you already have this, if it was just presented like this rather than giving you the option first, st

236
00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:44.019
P7: because here you still are able to edit it.

237
00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:46.989
P7: So, rather than having the previous page

238
00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:50.060
P7: where you had to click one of the bubbles

239
00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:53.820
P7: if it were presented like this. You could change it if you needed to.

240
00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:58.294
Hieu: I gotcha, and then in your mind, let's say

241
00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:00.530
Hieu: I'm just trying to have

242
00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:10.919
Hieu: understand how it works in your mind here. So let's say, let's say it went from married here to divorce. You would imagine that edit button will help you kind of

243
00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:14.889
Hieu: get rid of this. This information. Then.

244
00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:16.400
P7: What can I click on back.

245
00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:17.410
Hieu: Yes.

246
00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:22.370
P7: Okay, seeing how it's the the toggle bubbles here.

247
00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:23.020
Hieu: Yeah.

248
00:20:23.546 --> 00:20:27.579
P7: If if you're going to have this, then you don't necessarily need

249
00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:33.589
P7: this page. But because the previous pages all had the box like this, where you could just click in and edit.

250
00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:33.930
Hieu: Yeah.

251
00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:38.230
P7: Having having it like this rather than giving me the option like this.

252
00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:45.680
P7: So if it were just another box like this, where I could also click in and edit it if I needed to. Here. I don't necessarily need the.

253
00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:48.430
P7: I don't necessarily need this option.

254
00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:49.480
Hieu: I gotcha.

255
00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:50.520
P7: Next option.

256
00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:55.130
Hieu: Right. So you want it in the same language in for like a consistency.

257
00:20:55.130 --> 00:21:01.989
P7: Yes, yeah. For how the 1st page look with with my my name, my spouse's name, the address, telephone number, all that stuff.

258
00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:05.349
Hieu: Gotcha. That makes sense all right. Thank you.

259
00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.909
P7: But other than that. Yes, this is pretty straightforward stuff.

260
00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:13.810
Hieu: All right.

261
00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:15.460
Hieu: That makes sense.

262
00:21:28.878 --> 00:21:37.820
Hieu: I just wanna clarify one thing in the address area. You mentioned that. When you sign up you already provided the

263
00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:46.020
Hieu: contact information. Are you referring to that as signing up for Va benefit, or more like

264
00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:49.589
Hieu: when you sign up for the va.gov.

265
00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:51.419
P7: Oh, just just the va.gov.

266
00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:54.629
Hieu: I gotcha recently. My son.

267
00:21:55.480 --> 00:22:16.552
P7: He was a dependent before he turned 18, so he dropped off. And now he's going to school, so I'm adding him back on. So he created a va.gov account for himself, put in all that information when he opened the account. So now, if he ever needed to do any adjustments. He, he himself would come in, and all that stuff is already pre populated, and he's just updating or looking for

268
00:22:17.794 --> 00:22:31.940
P7: results of things that he's waiting for checking his payments or something. But once you originally put in that information, yes, you still have the option to edit it, but it's stuff that the va.gov website or app has captured already, and you don't need to

269
00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:34.369
P7: rehash it every single time.

270
00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:38.380
Hieu: I gotcha. Thank you for clarifying that.

271
00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:42.830
Hieu: and then we can move on to the next portion. So you press. Continue.

272
00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:52.180
P7: Okay? And I'm just curious. Here, spouse unmarried. Child.

273
00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:56.089
P7: 13. 0, okay, that's the same stuff that's in there. Currently.

274
00:22:56.650 --> 00:23:00.459
P7: Okay, yeah, this, this is pretty straightforward.

275
00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:02.870
Hieu: Yeah, okay, you can continue. Then.

276
00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:07.060
P7: You have another dependent.

277
00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:16.529
P7: Okay, yeah, that that makes sense. If you have somebody else that you want to add.

278
00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:18.790
Hieu: Yeah.

279
00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:25.439
P7: It all. It shows it in this box, like all the previous things did, and then it gives you the option to add, if you needed to.

280
00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:29.130
Hieu: Okay, so no issues there with you.

281
00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:30.029
P7: No, no.

282
00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:31.729
Hieu: Okay, we can move along.

283
00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:41.420
P7: Okay, yeah. Again, that makes sense.

284
00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:44.669
Hieu: All right. You can move along there

285
00:23:45.720 --> 00:24:01.370
Hieu: and then, like I mentioned in the previous prototype, you can use the previous financial information I gave you. This is exactly the same scenario where you and your spouse's work and salary has not changed from 2,023 to 2,024.

286
00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:05.780
P7: Okay, and the same thing. Just click in the box, and it'll.

287
00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:07.290
Hieu: Yeah, that is correct.

288
00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:12.320
P7: Okay, other income is 0. Okay, yeah. Again, that

289
00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:25.289
P7: that that is, you'd expect, or I would expect when you're looking for financial information. That's the kind of stuff I would expect to have ready to go to put in, because I know I'm gonna be filling this out.

290
00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:31.759
Hieu: Right that makes sense, and you can move along. Go ahead alright.

291
00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:39.609
P7: Okay. Yes. Again, your spouse's information

292
00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:43.750
P7: stuff I would expect to collect because I'm filling out financial information.

293
00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:44.540
Hieu: Right.

294
00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:57.600
P7: Yeah, again, you know, for me, I I wouldn't consider the medical expenses

295
00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:04.310
P7: or education as something I should have with me unless it was previously detailed on a tax form.

296
00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:04.770
Hieu: Right.

297
00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:07.030
P7: I I wouldn't know to bring it.

298
00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:11.810
Hieu: And then you expect this one to be basically what you stop and gather that information.

299
00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:14.439
P7: Yes, I would have to stop and get other information.

300
00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:19.820
Hieu: That makes sense, and then you can continue.

301
00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:20.680
P7: Okay.

302
00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:36.010
P7: Okay, yeah. I. This seems

303
00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:42.900
P7: this seems very concise and right there for you. And again, you have the edit button. If you need to make any changes to it.

304
00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:54.150
Hieu: Okay. And then how was this financial section compared to the previous one? For you, to the previous prototype.

305
00:25:54.150 --> 00:25:57.149
P7: Oh, this, this seems a little more streamlined.

306
00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:04.550
P7: you know, like you're using information that va.gov already has captured, whether app or the web based.

307
00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:07.540
P7: You know it's it's already captured, and there's not.

308
00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:12.350
P7: There's not the additional step for me to

309
00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:19.510
P7: look at it in an option where I have to put it in. You're already providing it for me, and if there's something that needs to be corrected

310
00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:23.170
P7: overall, then I could just click on the edit button and make those changes.

311
00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:24.650
Hieu: I got you.

312
00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:27.110
P7: No overall.

313
00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:32.080
Hieu: Right right. Can you do a step back? I am curious on your take here.

314
00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:34.440
Hieu: So if you go back.

315
00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:42.409
Hieu: so if you let's say back one more to the spouse. That might be easier, and then let's go with the

316
00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:44.540
Hieu: gross income at the top.

317
00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:52.099
Hieu: So if you scroll to the top. There. I would be curious if you actually would use. If you find

318
00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:57.529
Hieu: the stuff in the gray box, the your spouse gross income from 2023

319
00:26:57.710 --> 00:27:03.120
Hieu: versus the fill in like, would that be useful to you, or you don't think so?

320
00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:15.719
P7: Oh, no, that that would definitely be useful. Yes, again, it's well, I would imagine, if you have it. This is, I put this information in last year, or in 2023. Well, I guess it would be 24, because it's for the previous year. But you know.

321
00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:16.110
Hieu: Right.

322
00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:24.210
P7: It's information that I've already provided to va.gov, and you've captured it, and you know you're you're presenting it to me

323
00:27:24.530 --> 00:27:28.890
P7: and giving me the option to then update it for 24. Do you know.

324
00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:30.040
Hieu: Yeah.

325
00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:30.660
P7: Yeah.

326
00:27:31.210 --> 00:27:33.649
Hieu: Okay, so you do find that useful.

327
00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:34.350
P7: Yeah.

328
00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:37.000
Hieu: All right, then we can move along.

329
00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:45.820
Hieu: Yep, continue, and then stop right there. So

330
00:27:49.150 --> 00:28:00.369
Hieu: When you saw the 2023 kind of gray box of reference box. There! Did it help you decide what to do next? Or did it make you second guess, like any current information.

331
00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:02.740
P7: No, it was helpful.

332
00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:03.510
Hieu: Okay.

333
00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:07.089
Hieu: But it was just more of a reference thing that

334
00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:10.420
Hieu: even without it, you you didn't need.

335
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:21.670
P7: I I didn't necessarily need it. No, but it was there for me to reference and know, oh, okay, that's that's what was there last year, and if it hadn't changed I could verify it with the paperwork I brought this time to.

336
00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:24.760
P7: you know. Compare it, or or update it as necessary.

337
00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:37.030
Hieu: I gotcha. Thank you for that, and then on a scale of one to 5 or one being very easy and 5 being very hard. How is it for you to complete this financial section.

338
00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:38.820
P7: One.

339
00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:39.750
Hieu: One.

340
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:40.170
P7: Yes.

341
00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:40.640
Hieu: Gotcha.

342
00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:47.160
P7: Again, with the exception of having to. You know you don't know about that medical and educational stuff that you might have to grab.

343
00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:50.950
Hieu: Right you. You feel that that would be the one hiccup that would slow you down.

344
00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:51.690
P7: Yes.

345
00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:58.920
Hieu: Gotcha, and then in this scenario your

346
00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:12.260
Hieu: kind of your medical expense is also incorrect, so would this screen make it easier to catch, or you prefer the overall, that last screen that with the one with the claps, button.

347
00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:18.020
P7: Oh, no, I think this would be easy. You you have the edit right here that you can make any changes you need to.

348
00:29:18.610 --> 00:29:21.870
Hieu: Okay, I'm sorry you saying this one would be easier.

349
00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:26.059
P7: I believe so. Yeah, because everything is right here, not not.

350
00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:26.450
Hieu: Right.

351
00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:32.039
P7: One portion, one portion, one portion. This is everything in one. You just click edit, and you could go in and change anything you needed to.

352
00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:36.939
Hieu: Gotcha, and then can you continue on? And then we'll see it, that one.

353
00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:42.619
Hieu: And then I think this one, this screen takes a little while longer to load for some reason.

354
00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:01.210
Hieu: Oh, wow! This is really long.

355
00:30:04.550 --> 00:30:05.180
P7: Oh, there we go!

356
00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:05.960
Hieu: There you go!

357
00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:16.030
P7: Okay, yeah. Again, all the stuff that I already have, or that you already have army.

358
00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:17.390
Hieu: Right.

359
00:30:18.810 --> 00:30:19.870
P7: Upsold.

360
00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:21.550
P7: Yeah.

361
00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:30.510
Hieu: And then I just want to reiterate that this portion where the

362
00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:36.799
Hieu: medical expense you'd think it's easier to kind of adjust on the previous screen as opposed to this screen.

363
00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:48.380
P7: I think maybe.

364
00:30:54.510 --> 00:30:56.790
Hieu: You think that this one's relatively easy, too.

365
00:30:56.790 --> 00:31:04.659
P7: Well, yes, this is relatively easy, but now I'm thinking about it. Maybe maybe all 3 of them should be here. The vet info, the household info and the financial info.

366
00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:05.680
Hieu: Gotcha.

367
00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:09.690
P7: He's a little drop down, or whatever this is called.

368
00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:10.390
Hieu: Right.

369
00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:17.140
P7: Yeah, but other than that. Yes, it's pretty straightforward. It's easy to use but

370
00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:20.439
P7: even on that previous page that I was just at

371
00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:28.280
P7: I might expect to see all 3 portions right here

372
00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:34.650
P7: minus that 3rd page. It would then be right here, you know. You click on the the drop down

373
00:31:35.204 --> 00:31:39.319
P7: menu! And you again. If there were any issues you could change it in here.

374
00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:40.360
Hieu: Okay.

375
00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:43.560
P7: I think either way would be, okay. Yeah.

376
00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:52.329
Hieu: Gotcha, and then on a difficulty, scale of one to 5, 1 being very easy, 5 being very hard. How would you rate the entire form that you just went through.

377
00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:56.580
P7: I would say this one is easier than the previous one, so I would give this a 1.

378
00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:59.458
Hieu: Okay. So like, if you're comparing

379
00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:04.979
Hieu: one to one, I would say, this one's a 1. And technically, the previous one would be a 2.

380
00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:11.079
P7: Yes, okay. I got you. And then overall they're both.

381
00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:12.460
Hieu: So easy.

382
00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:13.090
P7: Yes.

383
00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:15.339
Hieu: Gotcha, and then on a.

384
00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:24.999
P7: I may be an anomaly because I'm a little better with a computer or app, you know, I I might have a little more tech knowledge than than some other old guy like myself.

385
00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:32.510
Hieu: I gotcha, but relatively straightforward for you both. Easy. But you just found this one slightly easier.

386
00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:33.130
P7: Correct.

387
00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:43.779
Hieu: Alright that makes sense, and then on an efficiency scale of one to 5, 1 being very efficient and 5 being very inefficient, how would you rate the form that you just went through.

388
00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:47.590
P7: This I would also give a very efficient number one.

389
00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:50.099
Hieu: Yeah. Number one. Okay, that makes sense.

390
00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:54.859
Hieu: And then, what was your overall? Thought of the

391
00:32:54.970 --> 00:32:58.209
Hieu: both the the 2 prototypes we just went through.

392
00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:03.060
P7: Well again. They were both easy.

393
00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:07.520
P7: as far as you know, working through them.

394
00:33:09.010 --> 00:33:17.300
P7: And again, it's maybe it's a me thing rather than a a product thing. Having to go get that additional information

395
00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:23.230
P7: for the financials, you know, having to get the medical and the school stuff, I I would not have thought to bring that.

396
00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:27.750
Hieu: Gotcha. That was the only part that stood out to you that makes sense.

397
00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:30.189
P7: But both of them, yeah, they they.

398
00:33:30.770 --> 00:33:33.020
P7: I think they're easy enough that that

399
00:33:33.770 --> 00:33:39.310
P7: anybody with a little bit of computer savvy should be able to work through them with with very little issue.

400
00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:43.099
Hieu: Right, and then of these 2 prototype.

401
00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:47.550
Hieu: So which one would you prefer to have on the va.gov. Site?

402
00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:51.090
P7: The red this one that I'm just completing.

403
00:33:51.240 --> 00:34:05.519
Hieu: Gotcha. And then that's just because it is slightly easier for you to to go through Gotcha. And then, is there anything that you would change about the whole form if you could. Would that be? I mean, in addition to like

404
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:11.130
Hieu: maybe having something beforehand for the financial information portion.

405
00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:14.639
P7: No.

406
00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:23.979
P7: no, it again. It seems pretty straightforward. You're collecting the data that you need for whatever. Or you know, I'm providing the data that's needed. For whatever reason.

407
00:34:24.179 --> 00:34:28.240
P7: it seems pretty straightforward and and easy enough.

408
00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:29.670
Hieu: Gotcha.

409
00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:35.349
Hieu: Alright thank you for that. You can stop screen sharing, and then I will screen. Share.

410
00:34:35.949 --> 00:34:36.639
P7: Alright!

411
00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:41.649
Hieu: Alright! Let me give me a few seconds to set up here

412
00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:50.899
Hieu: alright, and then do you see my screen.

413
00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:52.320
P7: Yes.

414
00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:53.360
Hieu: All right.

415
00:34:54.600 --> 00:35:07.229
Hieu: so let's take a look at these 3 options, A, B and C, each one showing your personal information in a different way. Can you walk through your thoughts here, and do you have a preference for which one you like best?

416
00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:20.170
P7: It. It seems ridiculous, but but I like the aesthetics of the letter B, with the box around it.

417
00:35:20.170 --> 00:35:24.380
Hieu: Okay. And why is that opposed to A and BA, and C.

418
00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:33.730
P7: We'll see with the gray background. Typically when you see things that are gray, you expect them to be grayed out where you can't click on them or anything.

419
00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:46.879
P7: And even though, see, it's not a clickable item right there, just because it's grayed out. You think, okay, I can't do it. Because, you know, that's how everything in the computer world seems to be. It's grayed out. You can't do anything with it.

420
00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:47.760
Hieu: Gotcha.

421
00:35:48.041 --> 00:35:57.599
P7: And then the blue line next to it. It calls your attention to it, but I don't know the the box around it, for in letter B seems to be more aesthetic for me.

422
00:35:57.950 --> 00:35:59.599
Hieu: I gotcha. It makes sense.

423
00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:09.139
Hieu: Thank you for that feedback. And then for the next portion. Here is the marital status again, same information just displayed differently

424
00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:14.720
Hieu: a versus B. And can you walk through your thought process here.

425
00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:24.950
P7: I don't have a preference. Both are capturing the same data. It's just in the manner I

426
00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:32.769
P7: yeah, maybe maybe the toggle rather than the dropdown.

427
00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:36.170
Hieu: Gotcha. So the bubble of option B.

428
00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:40.085
Hieu: All right, and then let's say

429
00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:54.379
Hieu: for the marital status. And you have filled this out before, and it shows that you're married. But for one reason or another, maybe you're divorced or widow, and you're changing it from married to divorce.

430
00:36:54.510 --> 00:36:59.930
Hieu: And you see this message, can you walk me through what

431
00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:02.219
Hieu: what this message means to you.

432
00:37:04.370 --> 00:37:14.969
P7: Oh, it's alerting you that, hey? You're about to change something. It it's not telling you that it may impact what's going on. But it's it's letting you know. Hey, this is something you want to pay attention to. You're making an adjustment to what you already

433
00:37:15.090 --> 00:37:16.280
P7: have stated.

434
00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:19.460
Hieu: Okay, so it's pretty clear and straightforward to you.

435
00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:20.580
P7: Oh, yes. Yeah.

436
00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:25.130
Hieu: Gotcha, and then finally, this one.

437
00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:49.410
P7: I. I do like the reference on the one on the right hand side the

438
00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:52.129
P7: again. Yeah. Letter B, with the gray box.

439
00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:52.530
Hieu: Right.

440
00:37:52.530 --> 00:37:56.280
P7: Referencing what you had for the previous time. You filled this out.

441
00:37:56.590 --> 00:38:01.410
Hieu: I gotcha. So you like the grade reference box, indicate that you find that useful.

442
00:38:01.410 --> 00:38:02.140
P7: Yes.

443
00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:05.920
Hieu: All right. That is very helpful, and I want to say

444
00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:09.440
Hieu: that is it for our prototyping?

445
00:38:09.650 --> 00:38:11.420
Hieu: Let me see.

446
00:38:12.010 --> 00:38:20.630
Hieu: and then I'll see if I, my colleagues, have any questions, but I myself do not have any additional question for you. Do you have any questions for me?

447
00:38:21.730 --> 00:38:33.179
P7: Well, real quick, just because this looked like the app as opposed to the website. Everything seems to be going to apps nowadays, you know, and really apps are just

448
00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:34.399
P7: or- or

449
00:38:34.530 --> 00:38:42.719
P7: in my mind what I understand a lot of apps to be. They're just directing you to a a secured web based

450
00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:45.455
P7: whatever you could call it.

451
00:38:47.830 --> 00:38:51.730
P7: it it is that the way the Va is going? Or can you speak to that? Or is that.

452
00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:54.180
P7: Specifically, you're doing app development for it.

453
00:38:54.180 --> 00:39:07.409
Hieu: A little bit. So this is technically not app. This is technically the mobile portion of the website. So if you log into your phone, even through, like the va.gov website. This is what's showing in the

454
00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:13.420
Hieu: the web on the web page. If you were to log in on your computer. It would just be a bigger version of this.

455
00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:14.630
P7: Oh, okay.

456
00:39:14.982 --> 00:39:16.040
Hieu: Yeah, it's just.

457
00:39:16.370 --> 00:39:17.499
P7: Yeah, our development.

458
00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:19.140
P7: I'm gonna go to va.gov.

459
00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:24.950
P7: the web based. I'm sitting at this computer here. And when I look at the app. It looks

460
00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:28.410
P7: very much like what we just went through on my phone.

461
00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:49.830
Hieu: So our initiative is basically to approach it with mobile. First, st just because it is less information that you display. It's a little bit harder to design for Mobile. So you design for Mobile first, st and then you translate that to the desktop version which gives you more surface area to work with. But for what you're seeing today, it's technically the mobile version.

462
00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:52.400
Hieu: the website. It's not technically the app, but.

463
00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:52.920
P7: Okay. Yeah.

464
00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:54.560
Hieu: It can be shown like the app.

465
00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:55.880
P7: Understood. Okay.

466
00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:56.430
Hieu: Yeah.

467
00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:00.470
Hieu: And then any other, any other question?

468
00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:03.200
P7: No, no, no, I appreciate it, thank you.

469
00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:12.109
Hieu: Of, of course. And then I want to circle back and reconfirm that you are comfortable. If we decide to share a video clip of this session to you with our Va. Partners.

470
00:40:12.110 --> 00:40:12.460
P7: Yes.

471
00:40:13.070 --> 00:40:24.729
Hieu: And just to remind you, we will remove any kind of identifying information. If we choose to use a clip like a blur, your on screen image or blur out your name and whatnot.

472
00:40:25.370 --> 00:40:53.659
Hieu: And then again, I want to say, appreciate you taking your time to share your thoughts with us today your feedback. It's going to be really helpful for us as we continue to work on kind of improving the website for all veterans. And then, lastly, preaching will send you like a thank you. Note with a blurb that you can pass along to other veterans that you may know, providing them with a chance to participate in future studies if they like.

473
00:40:53.690 --> 00:40:57.360
Hieu: and then again thank you and enjoy the rest of your day.

474
00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:59.039
P7: Thank you very much. I appreciate it.

475
00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:00.349
Hieu: All right, enjoy.
