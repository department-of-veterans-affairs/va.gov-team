### [Prototype](https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/share/6DQRJWOWAJY#/screens/349571526_1-_Intro_Screen)

### Project-specific setup

- Have the prototype ready and minimized.
- Screenshare.
- Be ready to share computer and mouse controls

## Intro (2 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Samara and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about finding and applying for benefits. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 – 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** If you've had a frustrating experience or find something we show you to be confusing, we want to hear about it. Your honest insights help us to figure out how we can improve the veteran experience, and we will not be offended by any opinions you express.
- **In this session, we will be looking at a prototype.** This means that we are looking at something that looks like a real website, but it functions a bit differently. For example, some links will work while other links won't. This is for the purpose of testing so we can focus on observing specific tasks. Do you have any questions about this or what a prototype is? 
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

*Start recording.*

## Warm-up Questions (2 minutes)

1. Before we start, can you tell me a little bit about yourself? (If stuck, prompt to ask about service experience, where they live, their work).
2. Do you have a VA.gov account? If so, about how often do you use the website?

## First Task: Sign in prompt on HCA intro page - 5 minutes

Alright, let's go to the prototype. As a reminder... (review intro prompt). Any questions before we get started?

Today, we are going to pretend that you have come to VA.gov to fill out an application for VA health care. We're starting from the VA homepage. To access the health care application, please click on "Health Care and Benefits" in the top navigation. You'll see the Health Care menu is open. Please click "Apply for Health Care."

Now we are on the health care application introduction page. Before clicking anything, I'd like to draw your attention to the prompt at the top of the page — "Save time—and save your work in progress—by signing in before starting your application."

1. Why do you think the website is suggesting you sign in before starting your application?
2. In real life, do you think you would sign in before starting the application or would you continue without signing in?
3. What do you think will happen if you click "Start your application without signing in."?
4. Is there anything you think could be improved about this prompt?

Today, we're going to continue without signing in, so please click "Start your application without signing in." for me.

## Second Task: Signed out ID page - 10 minutes

Now that we're on the next page:

1. Can you tell me what you're looking at here?
2. What do you think the purpose of this page is?
3. Why do you think we are asking for a name/birth date/ssn *before* filling out the health care application?
4. Before clicking anything, what do you think will happen when you click "Continue Application"?
5. Do you trust this page?
6. What questions do you have about this page?
7. What could be improved about this page?

OK, let's pretend you have filled out the form. Please click into the First Name box for me — this will fill in the form in the prototype, though in real life, you'd be able to type into each field as you would normally expect to.

Please click "Continue to the Application." (Wait for "Please sign in prompt" to load) Now it looks like you're being asked to sign in to VA.gov.

1. Why do you think the site is asking you to sign in?
2. What do you expect will happen when you sign in?
3. How are you feeling at this point in your experience trying to get to the health care application?
4. Imagine this were real life – what do you think you would do from here?

## Third Task: LOA1 identity verification prompt and ID verification flow - 10 minutes

Alright, now please click "Sign in to VA.gov" for me. (Wait until sign in modal pops up). Please click "Sign in with ID.me." Now you can click anywhere in the email or password field to fill in the form, and click "Sign In" to continue.

So now we're back on the health care intro page, except this time you are seeing a message "Please verify your identity before applying for VA health care."

1. Why do you think you are seeing this prompt? Why do you think you are being asked to verify your identity before you can apply for health care?
2. What do you think this has to do with the previous page we looked at where you had to put in your name/birth date/SSN?
3. How are you feeling at this point?
4. Imagine this were real life – what do you think you would do from here?
5. What do you expect to happen when you click "verify my identity?"
6. How could this prompt be improved?

Alright, let's continue. Please click "Verify my identity."

(On interstitial page) Before we continue, I want to let you know about what we're going to do with the next few screens. We're going to show you what the identity verification process is like so you have an idea of what someone might go through to get to the end of the process we're looking at today. However, I won't be asking you to evaluate the identity verification screens as I've been asking you questions about other pages we've looked at. We'll move through this part fairly quickly. Any question before we continue? OK, you can click "Continue."

Now we are in the ID verification flow:

1. First, you'd enter your personal information. (arrow to next page)
2. Next you'd enter your address information. (arrow to next page)
3. Next, you'd enter your phone number. (arrow to next page)
4. After that, we'd have you confirm everthing you have entered. (arrow to next page)
5. And finally, we'll have you answer some questions based on your credit profile to confirm you are who you say you are. (arrow to next page)

Now we are at the end of this process. Before we click "Finish:" 

1. In real life, do you think you would have completed the identity verification flow to get to the next step in the health care application process?
2. What do you think will happen next?

## Fourth Task: LOA3 Warning - 12 minutes

So now you can see we are back on the "Apply for Health Care Benefits" page you've already seen a few times before.

1. Tell me what you're seeing here. What is this page communicating to you?
2. Why do you think you are now being told you don't qualify for VA health care?
3. How do you feel at this point?
4. In real life, what do you think you would do next?
5. Would you reapply?
6. What do you think would happen if you clicked "Reapply for VA health care?"
7. What questions do you have?
8. How could this page be improved?

(arrow to next screen) Alright, now we're going to look at some potentially different outcomes someone might see instead of the previous screen:

(Enrolled)

1. What is this screen trying to communicate?
2. How would you feel if you saw this?
3. Would you reapply?
4. How could this page be improved?

(Rejected)

1. What is this screen trying to communicate?
2. How would you feel if you saw this?

## Post-Task Interview - 2 minutes

1. Overall, how did you feel about the entire experience we looked at today? How do you think you would feel if you'd had this experience in real life?
2. In addition to anything you have already mentioned, how could this overall experience be improved?
