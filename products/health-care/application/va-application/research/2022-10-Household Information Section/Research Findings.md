## Research Goals

### Background

The household information section, step 4 out of 6 in the application progress flow, has been identified as a pain point through [past research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/research/Household%20info%20design%20discovery.pdf) and [page analtyics](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/research/april-may-2021/end-user-discovery/10-10EZ%20Discovery%20Research%20readout.pdf) indicating it is the area of the form with a high drop-off rate. Initial discovery of this problem space began with an [UX audit](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/Household%20section%20redesign/Research/Household-UX-Audit.md) that included looking at usability best practices and competitive research lens, prior to starting design. The [propsed new flow](https://www.sketch.com/s/da85cf44-4503-4e98-834e-ff068b242ef6/p/AE225764-D5BB-4CE6-9577-38E8F570392B/canvas) and designs include rearranging the order of the questions, updating the content to plain language standards and design pattern updates around multiple responses (list and loop) used when adding dependents

The health care application fits into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) at the following stages:
- Getting out
- Starting up
- Taking care of myself

### Goals

**1. Determine if the questions and additional information within the household information section is clear and actionable.**

**2. Determine if the financial onboarding page content is helpful and understandable.**  

**3. Optimize the order and flow of questions within the household information section.**


These research goals support key results from the [initiative brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/Household%20section%20redesign/ReadMe.md#key-result-3-veterans-feel-prepared-when-they-begin-the-household-section):
- Key Result #3: Veterans feel prepared when they begin the household section
- Key Result #4: Veterans understand what is being asked of them and why, feeling comfortable in providing the information.

## Research Questions

**Goal 1 - Clear and actionable**
- Are the questions worded and explained in a way that is clear and understandable to the Veterans/applicants or is additional context and explanation needed?
- What is easy or difficult and why for the Veteran/applicant as they work through the household information questions?

**Goal 2 - Helpful and understandable content** 
- Is there information missing that could help the Veteran/applicant complete the annual income and deductible information questions?
- Does the Veteran/applicant seem to struggle or indicate they have to pause and return to the application to get income information?

**Goal 3 - Logical order**
- Within the household information section (step 4) of the 10-10EZ health care application, do the questions occur in an order that is logical to Veterans/applicants?
- What struggles do participants encounter with the process of adding and editing multiple dependents?
- Is there clear error recovery and easy editing ability when adding multiple entries for a question?

## Methodology 

A moderated usability study using an interactive prototype of the 10-10EZ health care application. The study included separate versions of the prototype for desktop and mobile users.


## Hypotheses and Conclusions

1) The financial information question is well received and the onboarding page provides the Veteran/applicant with the information they need to proceed easily through this section of the application.
   - **Conclusion 1: Maybe true**
   - Most participants rated the introduction page favorably (giving it 4 or 5 out of 5 rating) in that it prepared them for the application, however some mentioned that they needed more context and help to be able to provide this information and some also mentioned not wanting to provide it at all, but having to.

2) The content explaining the various financial areas (gross income, net and other) is easy to digest now that it is broken up into sections and placed in relation to the corresponding text field.
   - **Conclusion 2: Maybe true**
   - 	Some participants said the questions on the page about annual income were clear and easy to understand, but most gave an example of where extra explanation could be really helpful when answering these questions. 

3) The updates to the multiple responses pattern to add and edit dependents has less cognitive load for the applicant and is easy for them to complete.
   - **Conclusion 3: Not enough information**
   - 	Most participants were successful with the task to add dependents to the form easily. This study used a prototype with limited functionality there was not enough information to determine if editing dependents information had less cognitive load. Most participants did mention it would be easier to review the dependent information when they were editing or a way to view all pages of information at once during editing. 


## Key Findings

### Key Finding 1: Additional explanation needed
There were a some areas of the application where participants mentioned examples **where more information would be helpful for them to understand** what they were being asked.

- 6/10 interacted with or had questions on eligibility guidelines on the financial disclosure page (Disclosure Task)
- 7/10 participants mentioned the dependent question could use more clarification (Add Dependents Task)
- 5/10 interacted with who does VA consider a dependent or had questions on this topic (Add Dependents Task)
- 7/10 participants said extra explanation could be helpful for what counts as income, business income and how gross and net are combined (Income Task)
- 4/10 non-reimbursable medical expenses explanation is needed (Deductibles Task)


### Key Finding 2: Document and information gathering 
Most participants mentioned the process of gathering documents, one example the DD214, and/or adding numbers correctly to complete the annual and deductibles section and that this process could be a **potential reason to pause the application or for it to take extra time**.

- 7/10 participants mentioned the process of gathering documents, specifically the DD214, and the time and steps that would take them  (Start Application Task)
- To upload a document on the military service page, 3/10 participants said they would scan the document with a printer to upload and 4/10 said they would take a picture with their device to upload to the application. (VA benefits/Military service - upload task)
- One participant mentioned this should be automated as this information should be available already. (VA benefits/Military service - upload Task)
- 2/10 participants reported they would need to pause for the income information and need help from their wife to complete. (Annual income Task)
- 4/10 participants felt the deductible information would take a half hour or more to gather as it was asking a lot for a health care application (Deductibles Task)


### Key Finding 3: Multiple responses and editing information 
Most participants thought **adding a dependent was clear overall with nothing they would change or add**, overall participants were successful to complete adding dependents. 
And most participants also mentioned **it would be easier if they could review all their dependent’s information at once when editing** instead of having to go through a series of screens again.

- 8/10 participants could successfully edit and remove a dependent from the application
- 6/10 said adding a dependent was overall clear and there is nothing they would change
- 5/10 participants said editing a dependent would be easier if they could review all their dependents information at once with responses instead of having to go through a series of all screens again
- 2/10 participants attempted to use the browser back button or missed the edit link initially


### Key Finding 4: Spouse information and live with/address questions
Most participants thought the **initial page of questions about their spouse were clear and understandable**, but some had to **pause or had questions regarding if their spouse lived with them or had the same address**, they felt the question was repetitive or a confusing order. 

- 8/10 participants said the initial spouse questions were clear and understandable.
- 6/10 participants had to pause or had a change suggestion to the questions/pages around the if your spouse lived with you and had the same address. Some felt this was repetitive or asked in a confusing order. 
- 3/10 participants commented that the spouse support question needed additional clarification and context.


### Key Finding 5: Information was easy to understand and overall clear
Most participants answered that areas of the form were **worded in a way that was clear and easy to understand** - such as the Veteran information questions and the VA benefits and military service questions. 

- 6/10 participants answered that the questions were clear and there is nothing they would add/change (Veteran Information Task)
- 6/10 participants found the VA benefits/military service questions to be clear and would not change anything (VA benefits/Military Service Task)
- 3/10 participants commented on the process of uploading a document in general to being easy and simple (VA benefits/Military Service Task)
- 4/10 participants commented that the income page was clear and easy to understand (Income Task)


### Key Finding 6: Logical order and error recovery
Most participants felt the order of **questions flowed in a logical order and there were only a couple of small recommendations for changes**.
Those who interacted with the confirmation modal when removing a dependent from the list appreciated that they were given the choice to confirm. 


- 8/10 participants commented in the post-task questions that the questions seemed to be in a clear order that is easy to understand. (Post-task Questions)
- 1/10 participant stated the military service information should be earlier in the application (VA benefits/Military Service Task)
- 1/10 participant stated that the option to decline to provide financial information should appear before the financial onboarding page (Financial Onboarding Task)
- 1/10 participant stated that the order and transition on the page with multiple dependent cards to be disjointed. (Add Dependents Task)
- 8/10 could easily remove a dependent from the multiple list and 4 particpants commenting positively on confirmation modal (Edit Dependents Task)


## Details of Findings 

**Key Finding 1: Additional explanation needed**

Labels: [BNFT: Healthcare], [DSP: Contextual help], [TREND: Content]

There were a some areas of the application where participants mentioned examples **where more information would be helpful for them to understand** what they were being asked.


Research Question: Are the questions worded and explained in a way that is clear and understandable to the Veterans/applicants or is additional context and explanation needed?

> I guess this could be more clear, Like my initial look at it I thought veteran pension but is that disability or pension. I am not sure. It could be more specific. [P6-014] (VA Benefits / Military Service Task)

> Um, I guess maybe for these two put links to what they are (travel and copay) I wouldn’t know what they are or what I would need for those. The rest seems fine. [P6-019] (Financial Onboarding Task)

> No. I assume this is for a dependent over the age of 18. I was asking for expenses because under 18 there are always expenses. I guess this is fine. I guess this is fine, I am just trying to read through the jargon is all
[P5-018] (Adding Dependents Task)

Research Question: Is there information missing that could help the Veteran/applicant complete the annual income and deductible information questions?

> Where it says 'the financial information you will need', when it's asking for last year's gross income, before taxes and any other deductions - you could 'i.e. pay stub' something like that so service members know what they can use. Just to get their mind thinking 'oh ok I can use this' - something like that. [P13-019] (Financial Onboarding Task)

**Key Finding 2: Document and information gathering**

Labels: label 1, [PRDT: DD-214], [DSC: File input], [PRDT: income limits]


Most participants mentioned the process of gathering documents, one example the DD214, and/or adding numbers correctly to complete the annual and deductibles section and that this process could be a **potential reason to pause the application or for it to take extra time**.


> You need the dd214 so I would need to get that from the safe deposit box. I would be texting my wife for the financial parts. Finding insurance cards. 
 (P14-015) (Start Application Task)

Research Question: Does the Veteran/applicant seem to struggle or indicate they have to pause and return to the application to get income information?

> This is a lot I guess. Getting all of these numbers to apply for benefits is a lot. I don’t know. This is asking too much for me. Some people just don’t know this kind of stuff. You are just paying the bills. A lot of people don’t know this stuff. I don’t remember how much I spent here and now that prices are going up and down I wouldn’t know. 
(P5-025) (Deductibles Task)

> It would take more than an hour because I would need to do the math. Insurance, medical expenses and then when to the doctor this date then this date. It would take more than an hour and I don’t know if this app should take longer than an hour. 
(P5-023) (Annual Income Task)


**Key Finding 3: Multiple responses and editing information**

Labels: [DSP: Form templates], [DSC: Experimental] 


Most participants thought **adding a dependent was clear overall with nothing they would change or add**, overall participants were successful to complete adding dependents. And most participants also mentioned **it would be easier if they could review all their dependent’s information at once when editing** instead of having to go through a series of screens again.


> No (nothing unclear, would not add anything) (P5-019) (Add Dependents Task)

> I would say that this is what the standard should be – straightforward and very clear what you’re asking for. It’s legible and readable.”
(P10-024) (Add Dependents Task)

Research Question: What struggles do participants encounter with the process of adding and editing multiple dependents?

> Like if I click edit, it should show these pages separately. Instead of me having to go through all of them again
(P6-024) (Edit Dependents Task)

> Go to edit and then you update the information and click continue. Then it take you back to this page right here. 
(P5-020) (Edit Dependents Task)


**Key Finding 4: Spouse information and live with/address questions**

Labels: [DSC: Address block], [DSP: Contextual help], [TREND: Content]


Most participants thought the **initial page of questions about their spouse were clear and understandable**, but some had to **pause or had questions regarding if their spouse lived with them or had the same address**, they felt the question was repetitive or a confusing order.


> Yeah so that’s understandable. It’s just like before when I filled out mine, so that’s good.” (P11-014)

> It’s good. I think it's fine. This is smooth compared to some of the things I had to fill out on VA stuff. This is simple. (P5-017)

> If it were no than it could have meant they didn’t move in until married, so if you say you didn’t financially help them does that effect you? It leaves it up to how people want to look at it. (P7-020)

> Did your spouse live with you - a little invasive whereas do you have the same address sounds better. It is a little less accusatory (P3-028)

> Yes I understand them...Well the only thing I would – does the spouse live with you last year, what if it was only like 6 months?” (P11-015)

> I feel like maybe I shouldn’t have to enter my address again. I would expect it to already generate the household information. (P10-022)


**Key Finding 5: Information was easy to understand and overall clear**

Labels: [TREND: Content]


Most participants answered that **questions of the form were worded in a way that was clear and easy to understand** - such as the Veteran information questions and the VA benefits and military service questions.


> Not at all. Again it is clear to me and I am 74, I lose brain cells on a daily and its still good. (P4-004) (Veteran Information Task)

> So far so good. Its self-explanatory. (P7-005) (Veteran Information Task)

> It is working pretty well. It flows pretty well is the way I would say it. It’s straightforward, do you have this, what is this and click here. It makes it easy to fill out. It is very straight forward. (P14-023) (VA Benefits / Miliary Service Task)

> It seems simple enough, it is telling me the information they are going to need. (P6-018) (Financial Disclosure Task)


**Key Finding 6: Logical order and error recovery**

Labels: [DSC: Modal] 


Most participants felt the order of **questions flowed in a logical order** and there were only a couple of small recommendations for changes.
Those who interacted with the **confirmation modal when removing a dependent from the list appreciated** that they were given the choice to confirm. 

Research Question: Within the household information section (step 4) of the 10-10EZ health care application, do the questions occur in an order that is logical to Veterans/applicants?

> I thought it flowed pretty good. (P11-027) (Post Task Interview)

> Nothing to me seemed out of order. It started out with the service member information - it flowed good throughout the application process. I wouldn't change the order. (P13-036) (Post Task Interview)

> I would do the relationship prior to the name. Then name, then SSN, DOB,. That’s how your brain works, spouse, child, stepchild. (P3-031) (Add Dependents Task)


Research Question: Is there clear error recovery and easy editing ability when adding multiple entries for a question?


> Yeah, to me – because it could have been an accident, me hitting that [option to confirm choice in modal]. If it had cancelled it right away I could lose a bunch of information that I took my time to [enter]. It could be frustrating if that were to automatically cancel instead of asking. (P10-025) (Edit Dependents Task)

> See sometimes, and I don’t want to make a wrong assumption here, if you click ‘remove’ it will just remove everything you put in there without even giving this additional information [the modal], which this does, which I appreciate. Very nice compared to what I’ve seen so far with the quality and user-friendliness overall. So I would hit ‘no, cancel’ since I’m given the option, and you should always be given the option. (P12-026) (Edit Dependents Task)


## Additional Insights

### Insight A: Progress bar component

Labels: [DSC: Progress Bars]

Two participants commented on the utility of the progress bar, suggesting that they should be able to interact with it, or that it more accurately represent the number of steps in the form.

> Yes. It shows the status, which is very nice, but also if I hovered over this with the mouse, it would show what that actually was. Or something – maybe right underneath this blue part. (P12-025) (Edit Dependents Task)

> It would be nice if it had I guess 2 of 6 questions. I know it says the steps but a lot of time you go through serval pages until you reach the next step. Some way of knowing how long you will be doing it. (P14-017) (Veteran Information Task)

### Insight B: One-thing-per-page

Labels: [DSP: Form templates]


Two participants commented of the frequency of clicking continue, and that there were too few fields on certain pages.

> For me the steps and continue, it is annoying to have 6 steps I would prefer 2 or 3. You can fit more boxes on this page, like a lot more. 3 boxers is nothing. Clicking continue is more steps that I have to do. (P6-010) (Veteran Information Task)

> I wish a lot of these questions were more than one on a page. It would make it easier for me, because asking if they want to fill it out than one question next page and one question. A lot of the time my connection isn't great, so it takes a while for pages to load and slows down the process. (P14-033) (Spouse Information Task)

> In a desktop version or tablet version it is annoying because I am constantly clicking through. It makes me think the 6 bars are maybe only 3 because I don’t need to go through 20 pages to answer 4 questions. Same thing here, it is asking one question than going to the next page. I like a lot of tasks at one time. (P14-038) (Spouse Information Task)

> Just the fact that you were constantly hitting continue after one question. That would be my only complaint, it is going to take a while and clicking next on every answer. Just a pet peeve thing, just let me answer the questions type of thing. (P14-068) (Post Task Interview)

### Insight C: Need help footer

A couple participants commented on the global footer with contact information that was on all pages as a helpful resource and that it was nice to not have these numbers provided only at the beginning of the application, but along they way so they are there when needed. 

> So again, the fact that phone number is on the bottom of every page is great. Sometimes they give you that information on the first page and if you don't write it down.. wish I knew that number I was supposed to call. The fact that is provided on every page is really helpful too. (P14-060)(Annual Income Task)


### Insight D:  Service dates - multiple responses
Labels: [DSP: Multiple responses]

A couple participants commented that there could be multiple service dates, breaks in service, or service with different branches. Clarification around what to put here or the ability to add multiple service dates would help with this question. 

> Actually there's one thing I would give a suggestion to, just looking at service start date and service end date: some service members break in service, or they may have been reserve or national guard. I don't think there's a way to put that information in there too [multiple start/end dates]. Those are added up differently when it comes to your service - I don't know if there's a way the application can separate that if there's a break in service. (P13-014) (VA benefits/military service Task)


### Insight E:  Authenticated Path

Labels: [DSP: Signed out vs. signed in]

> “I like how it gives the option checking to see if I’ve applied to the VA health care before – with that button.”  (P10-002)

> First I would sign in but I like to screen shot things so I know how to do it. (Reading Page) I notice to make sure you check eligibility; I was looking for a hyper link like when doing food stamps. This one has it on the bottom. (reading page) okay so far so good, save work and progress. So far so good. (P7-003)

> I would do ‘create an account’ this first option here. (P12-003)


## Recommendations

* **Content review - adding more context where needed**
   - Annual/spouse income - what if income is shared/combined with spouse? [P6-028]
   - Annual/spouse income - severance pay inflating amount [P7-034]
   - Deductible income - additional deductible expenses like child support/ spousal support? [P7-036][P10-031]
   - Deductible income - more context about insurance needed? [P10-032]
   - Income/deductible pages in general - context on whether your income level can affect benefits, if so, how? [P13-032][P5-015]
   - Deductible income - examples of non-reimbursable medical expenses? [P13-033][P14-064]
   - Consider updating language: spouse "live with you" vs spouse "has same address" (latter is standard on other sites?) [P3-028]

* **Multiple responses edit flow**
   - Refinement to multiple response pattern when editing dependent information [Key Finding 3]

* **Multiple service periods**
   - Method for inputting multiple service periods [P10-014][P13-014]
   - Questions: What information is needed to be exact or an estimate? What is helpful for enrollment process systems?

* **Questions per page and order or questions**
   - Consider combining pages with only one field/task on them [Insight B]
   - Consider switching financial onboarding page & yes/no question: yes/no should come before onboarding

* **Additional research**
   - Are there any other scenarios where applicant is not already in short-form flow AND does not need to provide financial information information?  How to only ask for information when it is needed and how to not require Veterans to spend time and effort on questions if they don't impact the outcome of their benefits?
   - Baseline research study mentioned in next steps 



## Next Steps
- Usability study of current household information section content and flow that is live - [research study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/212) 
- Follow up with VA team about information specifics
   - How are service periods used, and is it necessary for the accuracy of multiple service periods?
- Content review
- Multiple responses pattern, edit flow design refinements
