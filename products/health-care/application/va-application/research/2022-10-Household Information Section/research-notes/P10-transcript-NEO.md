# Participant 10 - transcript

## Warm-up

[Sign-in question] “Once every couple weeks I believe. To check appointments, and also I move pretty frequently so updating address or bank account information.”

[Online forms question] “Not that I can remember.”

Start Application

[Mobile device user]

“I like how it gives the option checking to see if I’ve applied to the VA health care before – with that button.” 

[Gives general description of page contents] “Gives a good breakdown of what I may need: insurance cards, discharge info…[trails off]”

“4, just on the fact that you can start the application without signing in. Because maybe that somebody that hasn’t been to the VA and is looking to get their eligibility - you know, they don’t have a sign in yet. That’s what really stands out to me.”

[Asked what preparation he would do to fill out this application] “When I got out of the military I had already applied for my benefits and I was shown just how to sign in. If you don’t have your social security numbers maybe just gathering social security cards, and then maybe a DD214. Getting a couple documents ready – other than that I don’t think it’s that hard.” 

[States he would continue “without signing in”] “So without signing in, in case I’m a new person without a sign-in yet…[continues to next page]”

## Veteran Information

“Making sure it’s nice, and different colored fonts for the required areas in order to get this information. I think that’s very helpful.”

[Veteran name/dob screener] “Click it once and you’re ready to start typing – it’s pretty quick as well. I know some websites you have to press in multiple different areas to try and find the right spot. But, very simple. Very easy. In less than 30 seconds I have my information typed in so I feel like it’s a big step from where we’ve been in the past.”

[Post-screener page name page] “Having to retype in information is maybe irritating to some, maybe redundant.”

[DoB page] “I like how you don’t have to scroll for the year, you can just put the year right in. A lot of them you have to scroll for the year, and for the older folk maybe scrolling…[trails off].”

“I feel like it’s pretty easy to do.”
[Asked if anything missing/stands out at this point] “Maybe asking for branch of service, time frame for being in. It’s only demographic information instead of actual service information.” 

[Proceeds to race/ethnicity checkbox page] “Yeah here we go, demographics information. Being asked what race I am before what my service is, it’s just…[asked if he expected service information to come first]…yeah I feel like it’s more important for you to get the information from my service than demographics information. The whole reason I’m at the VA is because of the service that we gave…the sacrifices. To me it would make more sense if the service information was asked for first. I feel like it could give - the [VA] website- maybe if they’re connected to the DoD or something, to where service records could be matched quicker than giving the service information up front. It could narrow down do we search the Army database for the past, or just the Navy, instead of having to go Army, Navy, Air Force – searching through all of them. The Veteran putting the information down I guess will narrow down the search for information quicker in my opinion.” [Asked if he means putting in what branch he was in would narrow down the rest of the application] “Yes.”

[Asked about thoughts on Native American question page] “Very respectful – my mother is Native American. I didn’t keep up with the genealogy much and most of my family members on my mom’s side had already passed. I didn’t get to meet them much [goes into some personal family history]. I like that it’s asked.”

[Asked about thoughts on mailing address fields page] “It’s clear. It’s open what they’re asking for, easy to understand. [Scrolls to bottom of page] Having these dropdowns [“Contact Us” accordions, etc.], it’s more information to have there and it’s nice, but also the help [information in the “Need help?” section] without having to click a bunch of these dropdowns as well. You just click a hyper-link for a number.” [Asked if he would find those resources helpful/would click them if needed] “Yeah absolutely, like I served with a plenty of people where English wasn’t their first language, so if their settings [browser settings] aren’t already setup for the language they’re most comfortable in, you know maybe getting a translator. It seems very easy to press the buttons – you just have to press two buttons, or click on the hyper-link to call, it’s fairly simple.”

“Now what the wait time is like – we’ll see.”

[Anything unclear?] “No, but if you’re gonna ask for the address anyways – whenever you click on the yes or no [is home address the same as mailing address] it can auto-generate a response to go ahead and have you put in that information without having to press continue. It’s just something that I would recommend.” [Asked if he means pressing button to make more fields appear on the same page] “Yeah, so like an Excel spreadsheet and you have a dropdown where you select yes or no, and it can generate more information in a different field depending on which selection was made in the other column. In that same way if yes was selected [on the website] it would automatically drop down more of these information boxes, so I could go ahead and type in my information. If I’m getting redirected to hitting continue, maybe if my signal is not the greatest where I’m at – I live in the middle of a forest so I’m just happy it’s working this fast.

[Preferred method of contact?] “By phone, I prefer talking to a person not reading a screen. It’s easier for me to remember things when somebody tells it to me vs whenever I read it myself.”

## VA benefits & Military service

[Disability ratings page] “If I got reduced from 100% down to 70% now I have to figure out what I qualify for and what I don’t qualify for. If somebody was getting reduced I feel like that would be a reason they would be jumping on VA.gov, just to check out the options for previous or current compensation.” [Asked if he needs more contextual information] “This is just asking about current compensation from VA – I don’t know why this would be asked if I already had a previous VA claim, I would already be familiar with the website [referring to “Current compensation” heading] – seems as if you already  have had an interaction with this application. I feel like the VA would already have my information. I feel like if I’m getting asked again it could be auto-generated. A name and social security number has already been put in, if we can’t tell what the current compensation is by that yet, you know…”

“It helps to know that the VA is not just money for no reason, it’s for people with disability and makes sure that you are aware that if this isn’t who you are or what you have then maybe you’re in the wrong spot. Or, maybe you’re unsure about what you’ll receive – say you’re a person recovering and coming out of multiple amputations, they’ve got a long road to recovery, they’re not really worried about the VA system at the moment. They’re not quite hip to the whole process. When I got out I went to disability briefings and they explained this whole  process and they even explained this website to me – I was able to get benefits because I was able to track everything through the website. And also make any changes that I needed to.”

“There we go – I’m looking for the military service information.” [Asked if this was what he was expecting to see earlier on, or if anything missing] “I feel like service information should have been maybe the 2nd/3rd step I had to put it in. I feel like my service information would have been way more helpful at the beginning of the application.” [Explains why he thought using this information to search through databases might be more helpful than name/dob etc. for searching databases for his info.] “Maybe service period – a lot people get in the army and then they get out or go to a different branch. I don’t see a section here for multiple service time frames.”

[Service history checkboxes] “It’s asking me about awards and situations – somethings that can be a trigger in and of itself for people that have PTSD – you know, past trauma. Some of them try to forget and a lot of them can’t, myself as well. Being asked if I was ‘discharged from the military for a disability incurred in the line of duty’ not so much, but being a prisoner of war or purple heart recipient that could have been one of the most traumatic times in a person’s life.” [Asked about what “nose/throat radium treatments” were] “No idea what that’s for – I mean I’m glad I have no idea.” 

[Upload discharge papers page] “I think also, if you ask for name, military service, and then discharge papers in the first three steps I feel like a lot of it can be automated. Because all the information on a DD214 if it matches the same information in other military records I feel like this can be ran a lot quicker. A lot of demographics information would already be in the system. You wouldn’t have to type it in every time you go somewhere new.” [Anything unclear?] “Maybe if there wasn’t a required format that they had to be submitted in, like if I just wanted to submit a picture vs it having to be a jpg, pdf [etc] – which I don’t know just what a regular picture taken with a camera phone is – I’m not very technologically advanced, I don’t know what a jpg or png is. Especially the older generations maybe they don’t understand what that is either.”

## Financial disclosure

[He spent some time looking over financial onboarding page] “They’re a lot of great benefits to being a Veteran, ie tax write-offs and deductions…making sure that this information is tracked to make sure that nobody’s abusing the system, that taxpayers aren’t paying for resources for citizens that can afford to pay for it themselves, I’m very glad that it’s on there.

[Asked before getting to the voluntary disclosure question] “Is this a required part, or is this just looking…maybe where it says last year’s gross household income and detectable expenses – how those are bolded – maybe if that was done for where it says ‘if you’re eligible for VA healthcare based on your income’, maybe if that was bolded as well. But I don’t think much else you could upgrade.”

[Could not think of anything to change/add to page. Nothing unclear he could think of.]

[On voluntary disclosure question] “Ah, it is required – or, asking if you want to provide it is required.” [Answers no] [Asked if he would answer no as well outside of a testing situation] “Not that I know of. I probably would [answer yes] because my financial information is fairly limited, there’s not a lot I would have to put it in.” [Asked why he keeps checking qualified eligibility factor expandable info] “Yeah, maybe also factors that would consider ineligibility, like the income limits and net worth limits. What those would come down to. Because it says qualifying eligibility factors but not about disqualifying factors as well. What would get me disqualified – but then again, if I told you that you might put in something different.”

## Marital status/spouse information

[Says marital status question is pretty standard. States he is married anyways]

“I feel like it’s straight forwards, just like any other type of situation where I’d be entering this information. It’s very easy, but also maybe – I don’t see anywhere for [additional spouse information like date of death], maybe you could receive different benefits if this information was here too, not sure.” 

[Additional spouse information] “No, pretty straightforward. These are very good questions to ask it could be maybe you’re trying to change your benefits because you’re no longer married or something like that. No I don’t think I would change anything here.”

[Spouse support] “That one’s important. Maybe if I click yes, if I’m going to be asked questions about how many months out of the year I provided support – that could be on the next page I’m not sure.” [Selected he was living with spouse – the next page asking about spouse’s address seemed redundant] “I feel like maybe I shouldn’t have to enter my address again. I would expect it to already generate the household information.” “Other than that no feedback, it's just standard information blocks.”

## Adding dependents

[He opened and read over the dependent expandable info - goes over family details]. If I was filing these benefits and my mother was sick it’s nice to know that I can put that information in there [that she counts as a dependent when applicable].”

[Anything unclear/add on dependents info page?] “Maybe I would say that this is what the standard should be – straightforward and very clear what you’re asking for. It’s legible and readable.” [Hits cancel, sees modal – asked if that is what he would expect to see happen] “Yeah, to me – because it could have been an accident, me hitting that [referring to seeing the option to confirm choice in modal]. If it had cancelled it right away I could lose a bunch of information that I took my time to [enter]. It could be frustrating if that were to automatically cancel instead of asking.” [Commented on needing to scroll up to find modal – potentially confusing to have to find it.] “If I hit that button [cancel editing] it pops up right in front of me instead of having to scroll.”

[Asked to change/update anything?] [Commented on number input fields] “Whenever I got done typing, if it came up with the dollar sign in front, and point zero zero [decimal notation] or something, just to see are they looking down to penny how much I paid?”

[Comment on dependents support page] “Ok that’s good because you know some are divorced parents or separated.” [Asked if any additional explanation/information is needed on this page] “Maybe just the amount [the dollar amount, as an additional field] instead of just asking yes or no.”

[He adds an additional dependent with no visible hesitation] [Could not think of anything to add to the process]

## Editing/removing dependents

[Asked about fixing birthday] “I’d probably just hit this edit button here – on each individual. I can edit for each individual instead of having to go in and scroll down a bunch of boxes, you know dependent 1, dependent 2, dependent 3, dependent 5…it’s definitely simple that way. Maybe once you finished doing the date, if that’s the only thing you need to finish, instead of going back to additional information…[comments on going back through other info pages he doesn’t need to fill out]..maybe on hitting continue it was back at this page [the list] that would be helpful.”

[Taking one dependent off list] “I’d click on one of these remove buttons…[sees modal]…I’m glad that it asks if I’m sure I want to remove this dependent.”

## Annual income

[Anything unclear/add/change?] “Other income – maybe add child support, we do have a lot of female Veterans now than in the past – I feel like if the man should have to pay it the woman should have to report it. [Asked if that should be separate field, or included in sub-label]. “Just under other income – social security, unemployment, child support…”

[No other feedback he can think of][Mentions dollar sign/decimal notation in field again]

[Asked how long it would take to gather this information] “For me personally – maybe 10 to 15 mins at max if I have to go anywhere other than my phone to get this information. I can pull up my tax returns or paystubs [via Google drive]. If someone is at a disadvantage towards technology, I feel like that’s the only time it would make a difference as to how much time it would take to get together. Some people may have to call cpa’s, call their spouse…anywhere from 15 mins to 8 hours depending on how long it takes your cpa to get back to you.”

[Spouse’s income page] “Same thing – maybe I’m a stepdad, maybe she’s receiving child support but since we’re married we would have to use that income as earned income from her. Adding in child support verbiage there maybe.”

## Deductible information

“I guess just maybe clarification – amount you paid in funeral or burial expenses: is that including what insurance paid to me, and then what I paid out from that, or is that before insurance paid anything. Me personally I have a life insurance policy that covers that – maybe just some clarification, do you have life insurance – after or before insurance, the amount you paid.”

## Interview

[ 1 – 10?] “Absolutely I would. I have filled out forms like this before for my kids – yeah I would definitely recommend. If the person is cognitively able to process doing it for themselves I would definitely recommend doing this instead of trying to fill out a paper application.”

[First rating (4) - change?] “I think 4 would be a good rating for that. I did feel very informed, but also all of the questions that were asked, if I had that information readily available because I read that first, I wouldn’t have had to – ‘oh great now I gotta get all this together’ – I saw it had the financial information, sensitive information, demographics information, and service information. Preparing for what was to come in the application beforehand was very useful. It’s like a 4.5 almost a 5, but 4 for sure.”

[Other thoughts on the order of the questions? Anything surprising/out of order] “Just the miliary service [being asked that after demographics stuff] – really just the miliary service information. If you had some master vault of information broken down into army, navy – if you can go ahead and get that branch of service and dates I feel like it would be much easier to narrow down the information vs having to wait till step 3 or 4.”
