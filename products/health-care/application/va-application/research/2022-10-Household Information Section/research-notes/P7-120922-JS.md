**Answers**
- 5
- On this enrollmetn, that VA form, usually when I click the form, that form would go to hyperlink too. 
- Having things super dummy proof where you can just click it is good for especially older Veterans.

- Sign in at time, I click signin at the top

- This question might be offensive to some people (birth sex) 
- Thats all I have, (demographic page
- Other and write in what they are, instead of having to leave one out
- Doesn't offend me, but
(Amerian indian page)
- (reading through page, key words, scrolls back to top to re-read)
- Well I read over it real fast then had to go back it
- THe second decendent, I am Alaska native, I was just makin
- I think that is an offensive word 
- If you are requiring proof, I was thinking, what proof would I need to have for that?
(address)
- home same as mailing, yep that is pretty explanitory

**Answers**
- Clear
- No, it told you it was going to be 30 minutes.
- I think it easier to have little questions on the page, sometimes in a long form, you have to scroll up and see what you have to fix
- This one is short and simple
- A lot of next's but yeah
- I felt like a kept hitting continue and the steps are not moving 
- 1/30 I guess, not 1/6. I'm looking at everytime I click continue.
- I like to know how many more pages to go, me being impatient

(Military service)
-(read through page)

## PRIMARY Task - Financial disclosure question
> Things to watch for:
> - [Does the participant understand the financial disclosure page?]
> - [Does the participant open the additional info on qualifying eligibility factors?]
> - [Does the participant click yes or no on the financial disclosure page and express why?]

**Quotes/Notes**
- (reads through page)
- Yeah, that's pretty clear
- Sometimes, make sure I look at it
- In my opinion, there is no income guidelines. It is good to not have it on there, so people can fudge their income and cheat.
- Other than that
- When I worked - a lot of factors come into making the decision, not just income. The amount of kids. It is hard for a clear cut determination.
- Next?
- (keeps say next, continue btn) 
- Okay, that's easy. Gives you an option

- You are just asking, not that he is applying for the VA stuff?
- For me, as a Veteran I know my husband is not qualified. If t
- I have no idea how that works, I assume anythign applying for the VA knows it's for them. 
(address questions)
- Okay, pretty self-explanitory
(financial support)
- oh, okay
- Um..what if he just didn't live with you last year because you didn't move in until married. or that person was on deployment.
- (Went back to address page) If I say no, is that negatively affecting me? 
- That leaves it up to detemination of how people want to look at it
- It starts from this page - Why 
- Put no, then explain.
- This one, the financial support, a further explanation of why they didn't . But I don't think somebody should be punished for not supporting their spouse, deployment, moving
