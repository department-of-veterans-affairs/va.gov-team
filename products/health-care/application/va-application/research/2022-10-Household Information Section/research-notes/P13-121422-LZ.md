> Participant questions:
> - What worked well for you?
> - What was unclear or didn’t work well for you?
> - What would you like to change or add?

**Answers**
- everything is clear, no issues
- I think the information that it is asking for is fine
- what sex are you assigned at birth, I think this is fine, we have transgender service members
- AIQ, this information is very helpful, as far as being required, it doesn't apply to me. 
- I don't know if other service members would feel comfortable answering it. 
- I don't think you should be required to answer, but I know the reason.
- i think it should be required if you fall into these categories
- country is already prefilled with united states
- everything seems fine. the required areas are highlighted red.
- email, phone: I think these should be required, even if it's not my personal number, this way if va needs to get a hold of you they can contact someone.
- I would put both, none preferred , suggest put preferred email, phone or both.

> Things to watch for:
> - [Does the participant understand the financial disclosure page?]
> - [Does the participant open the additional info on qualifying eligibility factors?]
> - [Does the participant click yes or no on the financial disclosure page and express why?]

**Quotes/Notes**
- reads every page thoroughly
- household information give a lot of information, I would be more specific with what kind of documents that I can use to get the financial and deductable information for.
- financial disclosure: the qualifying factors could help the service history page. It should be on both pages




> Participant questions:
> - What worked well for you?
> - What was unclear or didn’t work well for you?

## PRIMARY Task - Marital status and spouse information
> Things to watch for:
> - [Does the participant make any comments about this page happening after the financial disclosure page?]
> - [Does the participant comment on or interact with the additional info component - "why we ask this information"?]
> - [Does the participant comment on the second spouse page with the two lived with/address questions?]
> - [Does the participant comment the question is intrusive or that they would skip and/or answer untruthfully?]

**Quotes/Notes**
- marital status, I'm on step 4 of 6. I like when you have why we ask for the information
- spouse information: asks for spouse information if you put in you are married. no issues with these fields. I think date of marriage should be required. maybe people forget the date, maybe that's why not required
- spouse additional information: maybe if there is room for why you are asking if the spouse lived with you last year
- spouse's financial support: if you can add explanation as to why you ask for this
- spouse's address and phone: if I answered yes to same mailing address, it makes me wonder why it is asking for this again. I would think the address would be prefilled with my address since I said spouse lives at same address.

- cancel editing this dependent is good, in case I need to make changes.
