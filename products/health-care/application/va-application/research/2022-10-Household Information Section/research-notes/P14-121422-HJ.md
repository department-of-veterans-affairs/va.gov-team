Freeform notes:
- Signs in to VA.gov about once every 1-2 weeks
- Working on a Surface (tablet/laptop hybrid) - will use the Desktop prototype
      - Uses Surface primarily
      - Texts with links have to be done on the phone, but still difficult (such as COVID documents)
- Phone is very small, has a hard time using it and seeing the information (has to zoom alot)
#### Introduction page
Preparedness rating: 5
Has applied for disability and other benefits, and they don’t have this list of stuff needed before you start the application, Appreciates this #2 item on the Introduction page.
Depends on Spouse to provide details, especially financial info, having the awareness of the required documents is very helpful
Would sign in to start with, before starting application
#### Place of Birth page
      - Likes to use touch screen more than keyboard, drop downs are useful
#### Progress bar
      - Loses place or may be pulled away (care for a child) and appreciates progress bar
      - Would be nice if it had some sort of indicator of how many pages within each step, how long it will take to fill it out
#### Contact Info page
      - Prefers email, easier to deal with (social anxiety)
      - Text is ok too
#### Pension page
      - Likes that the page explains what a Pension is, finds that some folks confuse pension with disability compensation.
#### Need Help section
      - Appreciates that there are other resources when having trouble understanding what the question/application is asking
#### Military Dates page
      - Would have to stop here to find his DD214, it has been 25 years since joining the military, and can’t remember the dates.
      - Continues to appreciate the preparedness guide on the Introduction page
#### Upload page
      - Would need to see if he has a scanned copy, maybe take a picture with phone and email it to self to upload.
      - Would take a couple minutes, especially if he knew ahead of time
#### Household information
      - This is where I would need help from my wife
      - Always confusing whether to include disability compensation in gross income
      - Adding more definition about this would be helpful (disability is not taxable)
#### Financial Disclosure page
      - Clicked on accordion to understand more about what was being asked for
#### Dependents page
      - likes that there is an explanation of what a dependent is
#### Dependent addt’l info page
      - likes that there are 4-5 questions to complete, feels better
#### Dependent Support page
      - Does not know what support contributions means, sounds unsure of what they would put there (does not currently have this situation) - Would click NO and keep going
#### Your Dependents page
      - Likes that there is an Edit button, and that the Remove button is blocked differently so it is easy to see it and avoid clicking on it by accident
      - “Perfect” - Likes the pop-up when clicking Remove to confirm removal of a dependent
#### Annual Income page
      - He would include disability pay, based on the last line stating “Dependent’s income if it could have been used to pay household expenses”
      - Confused on Other Income, because it indicates they would include SS, Disability, Pension, etc. 
      - Not sure if they should include it twice, would consult someone else to make sure it was entered correctly
      - This would be a stopping point - It would take 10-15 minutes to confirm this with someone (wife, calling VA, internet search)
#### Spouse income
      - Would have assumed first income page would have included Spouse’s income, would have to go back to previous page to check
#### Deductible page
      - Fairly explanatory
      - Not sure what non-reimbursable medical expenses are
      - Would appreciate a definition on that
      - Would take a couple minutes to determine what that non-reimbursable medical expenses means

#### Wrap-up
      - Recommend to another Veteran to apply for health care rating: 9
	      - Would say it would take a little while, and clicking next a lot.
      - Introduction page rating: 4.9 - a few questions (dependent SSN, definitions on terms, etc) that they would have to stop and go get before returning and continuing through the form.
      - It seemed to flow pretty well

#### General Feedback
      - Flows pretty well
      - very straightforward
      - easy to understand
      - I wish these questions were more than one on a page, it would be easier.  Concerned about internet connection, it sometimes takes a bit of time to load pages, and that would slow down the process.  It always worries me when there are lots of clicking through pages.  
      - Suggests 3-4 questions per page (especially for check boxes or Yes/No questions).  Suggests conditional appearance of questions based on the previous answer on the same page.
      - Understands that maybe it is this way to fit on one page, and maybe good on a phone, but it is annoying. Constantly clicking on things, and the progress bar doesn’t really match up to what it feels like
      - If I don’t understand, or get frustrated with what I am getting myself into, I will have to stop (Short Pause) to gather what is needed
      - (Prototype Limitation) I would like a button at top or bottom to Save (save your progress)

#### Summary
Participant expressed having issues using his mobile phone, as sites can be rather small and hard to see.  He has to constantly zoom to see the information, and does not prefer to complete forms that way.  The participant also expressed that they would have to stop several times in completing this form to consult another resource (find document, spouse, internet, call VA).  The participant really does not like the one-question-per-page model, finds it annoying to constantly be clicking continue, and would pass on that experience to other Veterans.
