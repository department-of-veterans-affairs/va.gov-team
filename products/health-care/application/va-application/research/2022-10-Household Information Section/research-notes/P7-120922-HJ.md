### Freeform notes:
- Has participated in research sessions before!
- Uses VA.gov and signs in often, more often last year while working on disability, this year it has been monthly.
- Will be using Mobile (iPhone) for this session
- Was able to share fairly easily on Zoom
#### Intro page
- Would initially sign in
- Likes the steps shown on the intro page
- Expected hyperlink for “Check eligibility” (currently a drop down)
- “So far so good”
- Scale for preparation: 5 (easy)
#### Veteran Info
- “So far so good, pretty self explanatory”
#### Birth Sex
- “might be offensive to some people, but there’s no other way to word it” (works in an ID lab)
#### Ethnicity/Race/Origin
- At work, has an Other and freeform field, suggesting this could be nice to have
#### Am Indian
- P7 is an Alaskan native
- Eskimo “I think that may be an offensive word”
- “Clear-Cut”
### Household section
#### Financial Info
- The Income guidelines are not showing
     - “In one way, that is good so people dont try to ‘fudge’ the info, but on the other hand, it would be good info to know”
#### Spouse info
- On diff address, “it could be no, cuz they weren't married”
- “Maybe allow a field to explain why spouse didnt live with Veteran last year (deployment, not yet married, etc)”
#### Dependents
- Not sure how to add another dependent, would expect a button at the bottom of the first page, until she continued to the next page where there were additional questions about the first dependent.  Then realized first dependent wasn’t done.
- Did dependent live with you question - Could potentially cause confusion with shared custody 
- Expect page after “Dependent - did you provide support” question, should be a question on “How much is spent on support” 
- Adding or removing dependents is “simple” and compares similarly to other sites used with the same functionality
#### Annual Income
- For Other Income, ”i should be able to identify what kind of income it is, like retirement, VA disability, etc.”
     - “Not sure if it makes a difference in determination”
     - “Like Severance pay, that was a one time, not annual.. So it could throw off the determination”
- Same thing for Spouse income
#### Deductible expenses
- Child or spousal support - “maybe they should be considered expenses”

### Length of the form pages
- “Easier to have little questions on each page” 
- ‘Short and simple, easy questions”
- “I feel like i keep pressing continue but steps aren’t moving”
- “Some people like to know how many pages are left to go, Like ‘1 out of 30’”

### Anything else
- Phone Friendly
- Recommendation: “Probably likely, easier than the process I had to do “Paper” “
     - “Went into VA, just standing there, they hand you a paper, if you don't have anything, can file at another time. [This] would be a lot easier”
- 10 rating!  “Easy”
- Preparation rating: 5
     - “Would have screenshot it to make sure I have everything”
     - “Pretty self explanatory, would normally have that information before starting this process”
     - “I dont think you can make it any simpler”
- Order of questions
     - “No, it was normal”
- Level of explanation
     - “Pretty “Barney Style”, pretty simple”
- Relative to other sites with similar functions
     - “On phone, it was bigger and I can see it” (one question per page)
     - “On a computer, i can see being frustrated with one itty bitty question on each page, but On the phone, its nice”

### Summary:
- Participant seemed to feel this application was easy, mobile friendly, and would recommend to other Veterans.  There were only a few hesitations around Spouse or dependents having a different address, and potential for missing out on including spousal or dependent support.  The stepper caused a little confusion/hesitation, but didn’t stop her from moving on.  Income caused a bit of hesitation, unsure of what to include and whether it would impact a favorable determination.
