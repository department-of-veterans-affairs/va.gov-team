The day and the year.” [Asked what she was thinking next] “When did they become your dependent – so if they’ve been your dependent the whole year you would put Jan 1st?” [Asked if that’s how she would interpret the question]. “So if you had a step-child in June, and you got married, that would be June 1st right?” [Confirmed her expectation – asked if would add/clarify anything] “Something about when they became your dependent, maybe needs a little bit more.” [Asked to explain] “It would have to be when you got married [if you had a step-child] – yeah.”

## Annual income

[Asked what she is thinking when reading] “They’re asking for gross income…do most people know what it is? [Asked what she would do to gather that info] “I would know on my taxes what it would be, but I don’t know if I would know my gross annual income.” [Anything unclear/add?] “No seems clear.” “Net annual income from farm – I guess people would know what that would be.” [Asked if she assumes that people would know what that was if it applied to them; asked if she would fill out anything here] “No, I’d put 0.” “Then other income…yes that makes sense. You can add it up, you can get that information. You would know what the VA disability was – I guess for everything there’s a place you could find the information.” [Asked about time estimate to gather this info] “For me, I would have to go the social security website and get the information from there. And the VA disability I would know what that was because it's the same every month. So it depends on if you can get the rest of the stuff off of the website [other income question stuff]. Unemployment that might not be the same every month…[asked how my places she would have to login/go to find the information]…maybe 6.” “I would say 30 mins to an hour.” 

[Spouse annual income] “That’d be the same thing with the gross income. You would have to figure that out.” [Asked about your/spouse income on separate pages ] “I think on separate pages would be good.”
