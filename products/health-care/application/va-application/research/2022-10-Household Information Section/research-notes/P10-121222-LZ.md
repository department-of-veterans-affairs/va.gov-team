> Participant questions:
> On a scale of 1-5 (1 being non very poorly and 5 being very well) - how prepared does this page make you feel about the application you are about to begin? Why?
**Answers**
- 4, especially because you can start the application without signing in, that stands out to me

**Answers**
- shows different colored fonts for required areas
- quick
- did not have to press mutliple areas to find the right spot
- this is very fast and easy to type in information
- retyping name, ssn, dob is redundant
- like how you don't have to scroll for a year, can just type right in
- easy to use
- service inforamation is more important than than demographics
- service records could be used to match veteran quicker, would help narrow down the search for more information
- american indian question is very respecfiful, my mother was native american, i like that it is asked
- if home address is different, could add additional address information underneath instead of continuing to next page

## Task - VA benefits & military service 
> Things to watch for:
> - [Does the participant understand the questions and content through these sections?]
> - [Does the participant comment that the questions are too intrusive?]


**Quotes/Notes**
- participant yawning a lot
- disability rating question:
- maybe they forgot they have benefits
- I have to figure out what i do or do not quality for
- I don't know why this would be asked, I would think the VA would already have my information, or that could be already generated based on name, ssn
- military service information:
- I feel like the service information would be 2nd or 3rd, way more helpful at the beginning of application, database could pull that information that I  need or what's available to me.
- A lot of people may go in the army and them they are out or go to a different branch, I don't see multiple service timeframes
- service history:
- asking about awards , can be trigger for someone that has PTSD or trauma, asking these things can be one of the most tramatic times in person life, making them relive it can be hard.
- no ideas as to what is nose/throat radium treatments 
- upload your discharge papers:
- Upload discharge papers, should be asked in the first 3 steps, a lot of the rest can be automated
- maybe if there wasn't a required format, just a picture, I don't undersand what the file types are. 
- the older generations maybe won't understand, i feel I am more technilogically advanced and I don't know what jpg is.
