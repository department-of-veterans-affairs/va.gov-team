> - [Is signing in the partipants next action or do they say they wouldn't sign in to complete the application?]


**Quotes/Notes**
- (scrolls,)
- "It's really - it's too much information"
- --- audio breakup -- should be simpler
- (asked to repeat) To me it seems fine but to somebody older, it needs to be a lot simpler
- A lot clearer
- 

> Participant questions:
> On a scale of 1-5 (1 being non very poorly and 5 being very well) - how prepared does this page make you feel about the application you are about to begin? Why?
**Answers**
- 5
- Very detailed, explains what infomration to gather and what I need to do

> Can you tell us more about what you would have to do in preparation for filling out this application?
**Answer**
- Make sure I have my information DD214, make sure I have my social security and insurance. I would have all this information ready and available already. That is the problem with the DD214 they would have to dig through paperwork or they don't have it.
- Most people dont
- Thats the only thing I see as a problem right there, the DD214 is the big one
- I guess I would have to start here where it says sign in (doesn't scroll to find non-authenticated option, only saw button at top of page)
- 


## Task - Veteran information

**Quotes/Notes**
- Nothing really, just normal standard stuff I am used to filling out on any other side (name)
- I don't want to put in my social though
- There is just, normal, I used to work in , so I am so cautious of putting my social in on a government site
- (works through pages and questions easily)
- (Impression so far) - Normal stuff we answer every day, this is normal. Don't have a negative or postive about it, it is just normal.
- I just don't like the social part, that is the only thing I dont like, but I guess that is undestandable
(American Indian page)
- This doesn't pertain to me, it doesn't. I dont have an opinion about it, it doesn't pertain to me. it is clear
- (completes address info and moves to email and phone page quickly)
- I never use my home phone, I just put my mobile number in there
- (preferred method) Most people now, text messages and things of that nature
- (preferrence) Usually do both (phone and email)

(upload page)
- Most people don't have a copy, they would have to 
- Maybe it is as simple as them taking a picture of it and uploading it

**Quotes/Notes**
- This is a lot I guess
- Getting all these numbers and figures just to apply for benefits, it's just a lot
- It is asking too much
- Some people just don't know some of this stuff, you are just paying the bill
- I don't remember how much I spend on this expense here, prices are going up and down

## Post-Task Interview 

> [Study Specific]

(Re-rank financial intro page)
- I mean it did prepare me, I can't read all of it, 
- People just skimm through stuff like that
- People wait till they get to it, man, I have to put all that information in there

(time to gather info)
- It would take more than an hour, I would have to do all the math
- I would have to look up medical expense
- More than an hour
- I don't know if this form, this app, should take this long
- You should be able to just go throught the information 

(intro page)
- I remember the first page
- I would probably rate it a 3 now, need my spouse's information, those type of expenses.
- As you go further, you need more details. As you look at it you think you need the basics, yeah I can give you estimates. but then yeah

> Change or update question
**Answer**
- If they can give an estimate, that is fine that is easier on people. Instead of having to go thorugh all the insuran
- Too much financial questions for applying to healthcare, one has nothing to do wiwth the other
- I don't know why this all applies to healthcare
- What you spend, vs me trying to get a doctor or get medicine


> Did you feel there was not enough explanation given for the questions, too much or was just about right?
**Answer**
- Yes, very much so. Very smooth
- Some of the questions are just - why am I filling out this information?
- Everyhting was - you could undertand





- This was pretty easy, first time doing soemthing like this. Wasn't anything difficult.
