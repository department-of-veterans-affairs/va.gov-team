## Warm-up

[Sign-in question] “No I don’t.”
[Forms questions] “Yeah, for different reasons yes.”

## Start Application

[Desktop user]

“What I would do is assess this page for instructions – it’s looks like it’s clear to me so far. [Reading things on page] “Have I applied for VA healthcare before, no I have not, but I’ve been out of the army [date]. A lot of technology has improved over that time, we used to do a lot of the paper forms.” “I would not sign in to check my application status because I haven’t done this before – but this looks good to me so far, it’s easy to be understood I think. I think it’s well done so far.” [Notices content highlight box at bottom] “If I’m understanding this correctly, it's not asking me to sign in here if I’ve already done this before, this is something different, correct?” [Facilitator explains there’s no right/wrong answers] “According to my understanding this is start your application – I’m gonna do what I’d actually do. [clicks blue button] Ok there it is, I was expecting something along these lines, ‘create an account’…looks very nice, nice display [noticing UI]. So far so good.” [Asked if he would create an account if he was doing this for real] “I would, I would do ‘create an account’ this first option here.”

[1 – 5 prep question] “I was quite pleased, it was in line with what I expected to see regarding it gave me an option to create an account, which is very similar to other websites I’ve seen before, so that was very helpful I thought. I would give that a 5 so far. It looks nice it’s easy to understand.”

[Asked about what he would do to prepare] “In a situation like this, I would have some of the forms I think they might require physically in front of me. Like a DD214, anything that might have to do with the discharge. Maybe my ID for verification – those are some of the things that occurred to me.” 

## Veteran Information

“This screen here is easy to understand, I would go ahead and put in my information and go ahead and go from there.”  [Continues filling out form] “This is very easy so far, I would click continue.”

[Notices ‘need help’ section at bottom] “And I do like this too…this is very helpful, because if there are any questions or anything like that immediately I have this option here in this ‘need help’ section, and it’s very well done I think too.”

[Continues to fill out section]

[Notices clickable areas in some blue continue buttons are not consistent]

[Native American question page] “None of these apply to me – I would put no.”

[Asked if anything unclear/change/add so far] “No, I like it so far.” [Mentions previous UI prototype glitches]. “Other than that I think it looks very nice, I think it looks well done and professional.”

[Email page] [Asked about impressions of page] “Seems to be standard things that one might expect, when doing this type of creating an account and entering this type of information. I think it looks good – no wrong surprises or anything like that.” [Asked about preferred contact method] “Usually I do a lot on email, I actually work from home. I’m used to getting contacted by email, but I’m fine with phone calls too when it’s necessary. Or text messages. I’m actually OK with those, but my preferred method because I use it so much is email.”

## VA benefits & Military service

“This is current compensation [disability compensation] with does not apply to me, so I’m going to click no, and continue.”

“Current compensation does not apply…[thinks aloud about his experience]…I’m going to click no and continue.”

[Thinks aloud while entering dates, etc.] “If I was actually going to do this I would have some documents, as I stated earlier, that I think might be applicable. DD214, maybe honorable discharge paperworks – to get things like that…I would expect this to be very thorough and it looks like it is. Professionally done through VA – well done overall so far.”

[Service history page, but speaking generally] “I really like the layout, and the text size is not difficult to read, which I appreciate…it looks nice to me from my perspective.” [Asked about additional impressions or feedback] “I like the status bar here [progress stepper], and I like the blue as it goes. It’s very easy to see and understand. It’s a nice contrast with the white [page background] – I like it.” [Asked if unclear/change/add] “No I think this is very easy to understand.”

[Upload page] “There’s the DD214 that I mentioned, but they have some other form numbers here that I didn’t consider. [Are those familiar to you?] It’s not a lot that I give attention to, I mean this one [DD214] I’d give more attention to. To be honest I haven’t memorized all these form numbers for this type of thing. But this one [DD214] I’m aware of definitely.” “This is pretty standard, what one might expect in this situation.” “It’s got tips for uploading, I appreciate that. Look how convenient this is [indicates upload button]. Now I don’t have it on my system but if I had it on my C drive, that would be very convenient to do this here.” “In a real scenario I would more than likely already have this stuff right in front of me – things that I thought the VA might require.” [Asked about how he would get the form ready to upload since he doesn’t have it on C drive, and wanted to avoid taking a photo] “Well it would depend – if I was talking to a person [via video chat] then I would ask is it ok if I show you the form with the camera on here for verification and so forth. If that’s not sufficient and we need the actual document then I would probably use a smart phone camera on there, then email it to myself. Then download to my actual computer – C drive – for future reference.” “I don’t know if this is within the rules – I have seen this, it’s not the norm I don’t think – but some type of capture option here, using your camera [indicates a possible UI button or something, next to the upload button], and I don’t know if the VA would even allow that. Sometimes people allow you to use your camera if you have one, to capture things and then upload it. It is nice to have that option. ‘Capture ID’ or ‘capture document’.”

## Financial disclosure

“This is inline with some other things I thought would be related in this situation…[reading over onboarding stuff]…what I like is the consistency about the need help section – that has been on every single screen, I do appreciate that I think it’s very nice to have that option.” “It’s [the page] letting me know what I’ll need for this…so I would click continue.”

[He reads note] “This is nice here [notices expandable info], instead of me having to know all the details about what this entails, I like this right here. ‘What are qualifying eligibility factors?’ – [clicks expandable info] – and I like that. There’s a very simple list here – very helpful in my opinion.” [Clicks yes to continue] “I can understand the reasoning [for asking for financial info], it’s not unexpected in my opinion. I would be as thorough as I could being that this seems to be a trustworthy site. As long as I know it’s trustworthy and I know it’s the VA, then I’d be fine with giving some thorough information.”

## Marital status/spouse information

[Marital status] “Why we ask for this information – here again very helpful. It’s not a lot of information, but it’s helpful. I think that’s nicely done there – whenever you can make something more user-friendly and express the trustworthiness of the site, that’s very helpful.”

[Spouse info] [Asked about changing/adding anything] “No I think this is inline with what I expected. As long as it’s a legitimate trustworthy site, and this appear to have that – that look to it, and the details and the professionalism – things I would look for in a situation like this. I think this is very simple.”

[Seeing spouse financial support page, states that he would like an “n/a” option; this woudn’t should up on actual site since he lives with spouse] “The way the question is worded after answering it the way I did [his spouse does live with him], it doesn’t give me an option to be honest about that.” “According to what I understand, this is like pressuring me to answer in the wrong manner, in my opinion. I wouldn’t feel comfortable clicking one of these yes or no options.”

[Spouse address info] “On the other one [page] it had United States as the default, so I was expecting to see that here [country field].”

## Adding dependents

“Unless they’re talking about my spouse, which I don’t think it is, that would mean children here…[clicks expandable info]…ok, but that is very easily understood when you click the dropdown.” “Initially before clicking that I was like ‘hm’…because I know the army considers my spouse to be a dependent, but I don’t know if that’s what they mean on this. However once I clicked the dropdown it became very clear.” [Asked if he would change anything] “I don’t even know if it would be necessary to change this [question wording] because it’s easily remedied by clicking the dropdown – it’s a nice option to have, very helpful.” [Suggests:] “For user-friendliness, ‘do you have any dependents, see below’ or something like that. Maybe a little change in wording to make it more clear.”

[Anything unclear or surpising with dependents?] “No, I don’t think so.” [Tabbed and it when back to the top – he mentions this as unexpected; this is prototype glitchy] [Points out cancel button] “I do like this, ‘cancel editing this dependent’, should that be necessary if I made a mistake or if I misunderstood something that’d be nice to have this option.” 

[Dependents additional info page] “Another something that I think could make this clear, in this wording here [dependent disabled question], I know I saw the classification of dependents, it can include spouse, it can include children, but just something that make that clearer here. Obviously I didn’t marry my spouse before the age of 18 so the way I understood that is that doesn’t apply to her.” “The same thing here [did dependent attend school question].” “I’ll put n/a here [expenses for college question]. Sometimes it won’t allow you, if it has to be a numerical value, but for this purpose I think it’s ok. I would like to put in n/a when I have that option. I would be programmed in a way that would not allow you to put in n/a, which I don’t like, I don’t like any question that pressures my into being dishonest [as in, the question didn’t apply to him, so even a 0 response makes him uncomfortable].” “Here’s another example, which I haven’t seen it on here – they will ask, like when you’re creating an account, have you read and fully understood this. I won’t click yes and continue unless I’ve read that, otherwise that’s a lie and I’m not going to do that intentionally. Sometimes I won’t even sign up in that situation – I’ll click on what the reading is, if it’s like 40 pages, then I’m like I’m not going to create this account.” “I would like the system to recognize my previous responses, because I already answered that [his dependent] lived with my last year.”

[Comments more on questions that would not appear on actual site based on previous yes/no responses]

## Editing/removing dependents

[Birthday change question] “The first thing that came to me was actually hitting the back button [form back button, not browser back button] – but maybe I shouldn’t do that. That occurred to me first, and then I thought about checking this [“need help?” section at bottom] again. Perhaps something in this section that would address that. Maybe a ‘go to previous screen; or something along those lines. I don’t see a quick way that that could be addressed other than hitting this back button [form back button].” “Maybe something here [progress stepper] like if I hovered over this [a previous segment of the stepper].” [Asked if he expected that to function more like a history timeline] “Yes. It shows the status, which is very nice, but also if I hovered over this with the mouse, it would show what that actually was. Or something – maybe right underneath this blue part [progress stepper section].”

[Take one off the list] “I would look at this because it has ‘remove’ here. But, I don’t know what that’s gonna do exactly. [clicks remove button] See sometimes, and I don’t want to make a wrong assumption here, if you click ‘remove’ it will just remove everything you put in there. Without even giving this additional information [modal], which this does, which I appreciate.” “Very nice compared to what I’ve seen so far with the quality and user-friendliness overall. So I would hit ‘no, cancel’ since I’m given the option, and you should always be given the option.” [Notices ‘edit’ link on card:] “After giving this some more attention - I was reluctant to click it initially. I think it stands with what I told you about the status bar – just hover over it and give some other options, just to give that extra security and comfort to the person doing this.” “It would be nice to have this [dependent card, with edit/remove] on any dependent related screen…[facilitator asks for clarification]…as you go, to have this block right here on all of that [seems to mean to edit/remove function].” [facilitator asks if it should show up even after the first dependent info page] “Yes.”

## Annual income

“In this situation I would expect that have the forms they need.” [Continues]

[Asked if anything unclear etc] “I don’t think so, it’s in line with what I expect. You have before taxes, after…what I would like to see here [net income from farm question], I would like some parentheses [around ‘(from a farm…business)’]. The way it’s worded here, if she doesn’t have a farm, property, or business then it’s not as clear as it can be in my opinion. ‘i.e.’ and then state some wording in there to make it clearer.”

## Deductible information

“In a situation like this I wouldn’t have thought to get any documentation, on my spouse that is. I would expect the questions to be more about my information, so that did surprise me.”

[Asked if he had a time estimate for gathering info for income] “I could probably locate it easily. We don’t have that stuff mixed in a bunch of places. Probably less than 30 minutes once I was aware of the requirements.”

## Interview

[Recommend to someone else] “Very nicely done, professional, the trustworthiness is there.” “9”
[First onboarding page score] [5 still]
[Question order] “No, other than what I stated – minor suggestions. Overall I think it’s outstanding.”
[Explanation] “I think it was just about right.”
