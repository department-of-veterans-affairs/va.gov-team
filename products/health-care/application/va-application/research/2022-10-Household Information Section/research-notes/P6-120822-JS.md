 ## Task - Warm-up Questions
- I have used it before
- Um, I prefer to use myhealtevet. All the other options are extra securituy and I can't figure it out.
- I type my username and password and I'm done

- Yes (looking at forms with household info)



## Task - Start Application
> Things to watch for:
> - [Quotes from participant about any content on the intro page that makes them feel uneasy, confused or not prepared to complete application.]
> - [Is signing in the partipants next action or do they say they wouldn't sign in to complete the application?]


**Quotes/Notes**
- I guess this part is just to check the status if I have applied before
- the other steps are just information I might look at or i might not
- Probably just skip and just go to the application
- (why might you skip)
- "Just... I don't feel, I guess I'm lazy I just want to get at the main thing and not look at extra information"
- "I would look at the time, make sure I have that much time free, before I do the application
- "I wouldn't look at Privacy Act becuase I don't care

> Participant questions:
> On a scale of 1-5 (1 being non very poorly and 5 being very well) - how prepared does this page make you feel about the application you are about to begin? Why?
**Answers**
- I guess if I was to look at it it would let me know everything I need to knonw. In my case, I typically know what I need before. If I didn't it seems to tell you what and why
- For an older person, they might not know what they need. I have done a lot so I am familiar with the processes. 

> Can you tell us more about what you would have to do in preparation for filling out this application?
**Answer**
- I have all of this saved on my PC in PDF forms,  I have all that ready to go and would just go to the application.


## Task - Veteran information
> Things to watch for:
> - [Does the participant comment on the length of this section of the form, number of questions/page or the progress bar?]
> - [American Indian question]


**Quotes/Notes**
- For me, the steps and continue, it's annoying. 
- I would prefer to have it 2 or 3. You could fit more boxes on this page, a lot more boxes.
- It is extra work clicking continue
- More fields at once on page.
- Or an option to show all fields
- People like me, who want everything on the page could see all fields. 
- This is even worse, a single box on the entire page (SSN)
- Yeah this is getting really annoying, a single thing per page. i'm not a fan 
- (Worked with American Indian page without much pause or comments)
- (preferrered contact question) For me, email. I can respond when I want to, instead of with phone and play phone tag.

> Participant questions:
> - What worked well for you?
> - What was unclear or didn’t work well for you?
> - What would you like to change or add?

**Answers**
- No, simple enough


**Observer rating of task completion (select below)**
- [ ] 0 = no part of the task completed, much difficulty
- [ ] 1 = Partial completion, much overlooked or task was difficult
- [ ] 2 = Partial completion, some areas were overlooked or task was slightly difficult
- [ ] 3 = Most of the task was completed with little difficulty
- [x] 4 = All parts of the task were completed with no difficulty


## Task - VA benefits & military service 
> Things to watch for:
> - [Does the participant understand the questions and content through these sections?]
> - [Does the participant comment that the questions are too intrusive?]


**Quotes/Notes**
- (Answers)
- (Tries to click on drop-down with Current Compensation page, Pension)
- "Is that disability or military pension, not entirely sure
- "It could be more specific
- Works through Military service page with no comments
(upload page)
- "Simple enough. I know what the discharge papers are for me. I already have it in PDF form. I guess that would be simple for me.
- This tells you what to do, for a person who didn't have it they could do that
- I guess if a person was completing their form on their PC and then they took a scan with their phone, might be difficult to transfer. 
- I don't know a way around that though

- Seems simple enough
- Telling me what information you are going to need

- (Interacts with qualifying eligibility factors drop down on page first)
- For me, I don't have an issue providing finanical information, I would just click yes. I wouldn't need to look at this part (points to alert box)
- If the VA needs my informaiton I would just give it to them
- (clicks no)

> Participant questions:

- (instructed to add a dependent)
- (First page completes easily iwith basic info)

- I guess permanelt and totally disabled, that is not something I knew about 4 years ago

> Things to watch for:
> - [Does the participant clearly see the buttons to edit and delete dependents?]
> - [Does the participant easily make their edit and continue on without getting hung up?]

**Quotes/Notes**
- Click the edit button,
- I guess, it would be better if the edit button listed the sections so I could go to that specific section instead of going through the entire thing again
- Like if I click edit, it should show these pages separatley. Instead of me having to go through all of them again
- (easily goes to remove button)

- Just the edit suggestion I made before.

**Quotes/Notes**
- (pauses while reading the page)
- Seems simple enough
- (long to gather question)
- I guess for me, when I looked at the appliaiton and what the requirements are, I would have it ready to go.
- I wouldn't do the application until i had the information
- "I don't know if it told me I would need my spouse's information. If I was doing it I would need them home or it would ruin it.

## Post-Task Interview 

> [Study Specific]

> Participant questions:
> On a scale of 1-5 (1 being non very poorly and 5 being very well) - how prepared does this page make you feel about the application you are about to begin? Why?
**Answers**
I think it had most of the informaiton.
For a person that is alone with no dependents, it had what I need
For preparing me you mean? For a single person, 5 is fine. 

> What are your thoughts on the order of the questions as they were presented in the prototype? Did anything surprise you?
**Answer**
- No, that was fine.
- Maybe I will put a save option, just in case something happens during my application. I can resume it.


> Did you feel there was not enough explanation given for the questions, too much or was just about right?
**Answer**
- Aside from previous suggestions, it was all clear
