**Observations & Notes**

- (Demogaphic page) I am been running into this since I was born - I'm Portugese. I am not really.
- It is a toss up, what do you want me to be?
- If I spoke Spanish, I just put down white. If I could speak Spanish I would select that too.
- (American Indian page) 
- (Pauses for a minute, quiet reading)

## Task - VA benefits & military service 
**Quotes & Observations**
- (Answered up to 40%)
- Did not interact with the why we ask addititional info component
- It is just asking me some quick questions about VA benefits for disability - service connected. Just for service connected
- Had to read it twice, that first sentence
- It is good how it is, I figured it out

(Current compensation page)
- Comments on add info "Don't get it" (not clear that the add info was interactive)
- I had no idea why you would ask that question then a yes or no answer. I hadn't tapped it.
- Now that I did, it is clear

(Military service page)
- (works through answering fields easily)

(Change or add facilitator question)
- Service end date is not the same date when I was totally dischared from the military

(Service history page)
- I'm thinking, well, I want to look at this. what I did in military, what my Dad did. Exposed to radiation while in military. I don't know anybody who wasn't
- Exposed to agent orange (add suggestion)

(Discharge papers)
- I wouldn't be the one asking to upload it, or would I be?
- You would have to have it formatted one way to upload it, that is what you are telling everybody to do.
- Not uploaded forms to va.gov. To several other places. I have been on Zoom on several other. 
- I don't have a problem uploading documents, it might be a gray area for some people.
- They won't understand how to make a document uploadable. Today it is not rocket-science. If I can't figure something out, I just Google it.

Add another dependent task
(When asked to add, went to Edit button instead)
- Click edit, hit edit
- Hit edit and it brought me back to where I was before
- I guess the dependents first name would be here, brought me back to same screen
- Imagine hit continue again and go back through same screen
- Back to more household information (dependent loop / additional info)

Remove from list
- I click the remove button
- (reads through pop up)
- So that would do it
- (change) I imagine if you removed them and screwed up, you could bring them back.

## PRIMARY Task - Annual income

**Quotes & Observations**
- (Scrolls up and down page, whisper reading)
- To me, that is just basic. 
- These are all questions you can find the answers to pretty quick, at least I could.
- (how long to gather question) Probably an hour maybe two answers tops. I would have to ask my wife.
- Again, I am 74 years old. We have done our own taxes for year, we have a file. We file everything. 
- At this stage of the game, have to have some sort of order.

> - What would you like to change or add?

**Answers**
- I wouldn't call it unclear
- There is going to be several things there not everybody deals with
- No, I wouldn't say it is not clear
- Well, I don't want to get too technical. Other income you could have setup, individual loans where you get money paid back to you.
- I think if someone is reading this, under Other Income, they know they would have to put things like that out there. They would show up eventually.

**Response**
- I would recommend it, this is pretty simple
- Depends on what their needs are
- Younger guys, that is a differnt world
- This form is pretty simple
- Something built in if they need something explained 


> Prepared question
- Give it a 5, the information you guys were looking for
- It is a form that could go a lot of diffent ways, it's a baseline so to speak
- It is spelled out pretty simply in the begingin 

> [Study Specific]

> What are your thoughts on the order of the questions as they were presented in the prototype? Did anything surprise you?

**Answer**
- Not really, they seemed to be in a type of order so to speak. 


> Do you have multiple dependents and if so, is there an application experience, good or bad, that stands out in your mind you can tell us more about?

**Answers**
- Only on my income tax, other than that no.


- When i do things on my smartphone, it is not as smart as my laptop. Something gets lost with what you are trying to do here. When people are looking at this informatin, on smartphone or laptop, they realize there might be more to it.
- I kind of get lost in this now, try and stay up with what I can to get it done. I was basically on paper my whole life. The paper forms are harsh.
- Most of the time, what I do with the VA is online/email. Or I get a telephone call.
