## Intro - Warm-up Questions
- "I am outspoken and I do have opinions - off we go"

- Faily frequently, do travel claims. have 4-6 appointments per month in (?), back and forth there. 
- 6-10 times per month. Id.com or my healthevet - use one of those portals

- With the VA for probably 30+ years. Maybe 35 years. Perviewed to most of the incarnations - what is happening now is really spectacular. And now you submit it and it goes where it is supposed to go, proof of delivery. 
- They can't just throw it away. It is so slick now, anybody that complains about it should just shut up.

## Task - Start Application
**Quotes/Notes**
- (starts reading headlines) there is the mental health thing, right away
- "I would put the mental health thing under the gather your information thing."
- People who needed serious help, if they come to that first, they will jump. Get them to give you the information before throwing the mental health thing, they will be less likey to run away from the process. 
- The DD214 thing is something that needs to be streamlined as well. People think they have to get the DD14 before they can do this, there should be something backended where they don' have to physically get the DD214.
- Some are in the system, if you have social, somebody should be able to back end those 214's.
- I would do start your application as 1, gather info as 2, then check eligibility. If you say you are starting application that is getting people moving in the direction. 


> Participant questions:
> On a scale of 1-5 (1 being non very poorly and 5 being very well) - how prepared does this page make you feel about the application you are about to begin? Why?

**Answer**
- 3

> Can you tell us more about what you would have to do in preparation for filling out this application?

**Answer**
- I would put start your application first, they are there to start that application. 
it is a rocky road to get to this spot for a lot of people, getting people to this place is fraught with a lot of problems. 
- Congratualtions you have gotten here, let's start your application. They you can gather your informaiton to check your eligibility.
- Based on what you are asking for, how it is positive here, I would change up that format, so when they get there they feel like they are starting their application.
- Start your application should have a blue field as well.

> Things to watch for:
> - [Quotes from participant about any content on the intro page that makes them feel uneasy, confused or not prepared to complete application.]
> - [Is signing in the partipants next action or do they say they wouldn't sign in to complete the application?]


## Task - Veteran information

**Quote/Notess**
- Social is good, 
- First questions move through easily, 
- Answers that he normally fills out forms on a mobile device
- (Comments that he uses all - iMac, iPad and iPhone, uses a spectrum of devices)
- Pauses on American Indian page, IHCIA, "huh"
- (Impressions of this page) = I understand precisely what you are asking for, and I would say something about it early in the blockage. Under the header. As to what the IHCIA is
- I'm an 1/8 Cherokee, it is something that applies, but (pause). It is unwieldy. If you are first nations, if you are this click here for eligibiltiy informaiton concerning this or that. 
- It can take you to a sidebar, instead of having everybody read this. Go back to the top and what is IHCIA. I understand res throry, first nations from Alaska. I think taking to a sidebar, instead of just out of the bag, not making everybody fool around with it.
- Like the previous screen - whatever we are doing these days- take you to a side bar then bring you back.
- Asking everybody for qualifiers would determine that
- 
- Numbers addresses, continue that is good

> Participant questions:
> - What worked well for you?
> - What was unclear or didn’t work well for you?
> - What would you like to change or add?

**Answers**
- No, nothing unclear or confusing. It is perfect. 
- (Add) a lot of stuff you are going to have to add, my personal needs it is all good. Some will say include this or that, I am not that complicated.

## Task - VA benefits & military service 
**Quotes/Notes**
-  "Makes complete sense, real clear"

- (impression of page) hahah - to the best of my knowledge this is my spouse. 
- Most of time if somebody is married, they spouse is sitting right there. The spouse is usally the one making the Veteran do this, they are very much part of this process.
- It is more common than you think, the Veteran has been led by the nose or the hand. they are going to do this or the spouse is leaving/
- By the time you get to this point, a lot of people are at the end of their rope.
- Nothing to add or change - it is solid.
- They better know that birthdate and anniversary date!
- I would switch up the spouse live with you and same address - I would do same address above.

## Post-Task Interview 

> [NPS Repeat Question]
> How likely are you to recommend this online application to another Veteran? [Scale of 0 - 10]

**Response**
- 10/10 - the alternatives are not sustainable. 

(Back to intro page rating - prepared rating)
- I think it was very fair in telling them what is coming up
- Very important for people to come back to it, a placeholder. Not just scrub all the data if they clock out.
- It used to not be that way
- If you clocked out or lost your dial up, you have to redo everything
- Rate 5 - just switch around the start your application thing

> [Study Specific]

> What are your thoughts on the order of the questions as they were presented in the prototype? Did anything surprise you?

**Answer**
- There is no way around it
- Going in through Veteran services organization or have somebody tke you though it
- Doing any of this by yourself is really daunting
- The interface and usability is awesome
- You are making a difficult situation easier.
