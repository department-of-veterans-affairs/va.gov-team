# [DRAFT] Research Plan: Health care application 10-10EZ, UAT of shortened form based on disability rating, October 2022

## Background
This research is to be conducted on the Health Care Application (10-10EZ) by the 10-10 Health Apps team.

The primary purpose of this research is to test the designs/flows in production and reach participant populations that we were unable to reach due to prototype limitations. These are the created [shortened form flows](https://www.sketch.com/s/da85cf44-4503-4e98-834e-ff068b242ef6/p/A71F1C96-FF98-42A2-9ADD-6D4B7A1DDB20) that eliminate Military Service and Household Information sections for those that we identify to have a service-connected disability rating of 50% or higher either through information we already have on file (pre-populated) or by the applicant self-reporting it during the application. 

September 2021 prototype [usability research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/research/flow-research-sept-21/research-findings.md) validated the flows that are now in production.

Previous [usability testing findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/research/Short%20form%20usability-June%202022/research-findings.md) and [research plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/research/Short%20form%20usability-June%202022/research-plan.md) conducted on short form flow during June 2022.

### OCTO Objectives
> Goal 1: Veterans and their families can apply for all benefits online

> Goal 6: Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

### Veteran Journey
Applying for health care and ensuring the Veteran understands their current disability rating can possibly happen in a variety of points in the journey including: getting out, starting up, taking care of myself, retiring and aging. 


## Research Goals	
The primary goal of our UAT is to confirm that the short form functionality for the authenticated [use cases](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/Short%20Form/Short-form-use-cases.md) works as expected.


The goals of this user acceptance test are to:
1. Validate that there are no issues or bugs for authenticated users with 50% or greater disability rating on record
2. Validate that there are no issues or bugs for authenticated users with less than 50% disability rating on record
3. Validate that there are no issues or bugs for authenticated users with no disability rating on record, but self-report a disability rating of 50% or higher
4. Validate that there are no issues or bugs for authenticated users with no disability rating on record and don't self-report a disability rating of 50% or higher


**Research questions**
1. Does the functionality work as expected?
2. Is any aspect of the flow surprising/unexpected?
3. Are there any indications of UX issues?


**Hypothesis**
- The functionality of each use case will work as expected.
- No bugs will be experienced.
- Veterans will move through the flow easily.



## Method	
### User acceptance testing (UAT)
We'll have participants go through a list of specific tasks for UAT and ask follow-up questions to get feedback on any usability-related findings.

## Participants and Recruitment	
We would like to work with Perigean to recruit for 10 fulfilled remote sessions. Therefore, we request that 18 sessions be scheduled. 

### Recruitment approach
We will be testing the [shortened form flows](https://www.sketch.com/s/da85cf44-4503-4e98-834e-ff068b242ef6/p/A71F1C96-FF98-42A2-9ADD-6D4B7A1DDB20) in production with Veterans.

**Groups/Use Cases**
1. Authenticated with established disability rating of 50% or higher
2. Authenticated with no established disability rating (self report)


### Recruitment criteria

| Total requested | Completed sessions | Veterans | Family Member | Caregivers | Service Members |
| --------------- | ------------------ | -------- | ------------- | ---------- | --------------- |
| 18              | 10	               | 10       | 0             | 0          | 0               |
