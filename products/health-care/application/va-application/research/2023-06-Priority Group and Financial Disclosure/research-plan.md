# Research Plan for health care application generative research study around Priority Groups and Financial Updates [Health Enrollment Team, 10-10EZ, July 2023]

## Background
The online health care application (10-10EZ) and the update form (10-10EZR which is only paper form today) can both impact a Veteran's eligibility and placement when applying for and managing their health care benefits. This is more so impactful for those placed in a Priority Group who need to have income information considered for copays and travel reimbursement in addition to eligibility. The 10-10EZ is the initial application that then places a Veteran in a Priority Group for enrollment into the full medical benefits package. The 10-10EZR is used to provide personal, financial or insurance information updates after enrollment. 

The outcome of this generative research study will help in understanding the Veteran's mental model around health care benefits as it pertains to understanding and maintaining those benefits - specifically around awareness of their Priority Group and that impact as well as updating financial information after initial enrollment.

### OCTO Priorities 

Which [OCTO priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202023.md) does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.

- Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience


### Veteran Journey

- This fits across the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) from **getting out to aging**.

- This impacts a **key moment that matters** in that Veterans need to select the health care coverage according to their individual needs and preferences and that is the best fit for them. 


## Research Goals	

Learn more about Veteran's mental model when applying for and managing their health care benefits including the terms they use and how they understand eligibility and their specific benefits.

Learn more about Veteran's awareness and understanding of their Priority Group placement including how that impacts their benefits as it pertains to financial disclosure, copays and travel reimbursement. 

Learn more about how Veterans would like to go about providing updated information - such as financial information or dependents - that could impact their health care benefits after enrollment.


### Outcomes
We will use these findings to:
- Check assumptions and terminology used to remain Veteran-centric
- Develop insights into an ideal state and how Veteran would prefer to navigate the health care benefits and Priority Group assignment
- Develop insights into how a Veteran would like to find personalized information about Priority Groups and copays online
- Develop insights into where and how a Veteran would expect to be able to update their financial information online

  

### Research questions

**Learn more about Veteran's mental model when applying for and managing their health care benefits including the terms they use and how they understand eligibility and their specific benefits.**

- What are Veteran's understanding of what benefits they will get and the cost to them when enrolling for health care benefits?
- What are Veteran's understanding of what benefits they will get and the cost to them after enrollment?
- What are the Veteran's current pain points with how the health care application impacts the overall health care journey?
- What is the Veterans mental model of eligibility and Priority Groups around their benefits and costs?
  

**Learn more about Veteran's awareness and understanding of their Priority Group placement including how that impacts their benefits as it pertains to financial disclosure, copays and travel reimbursement.**

- Do Veterans seem confused by Priority Group transparency prior to applying for enrollment?
- Do Veterans know their know Priority Group easily or do they just know they are enrolled?
- What is the communication and education process around Priority Groups like from the Veteran's perspective today? (current state)
- What information around PG/copays would the Veteran like to have easy access to and where? (future state)
- Where do Veterans call out as their preferred way to view their Priority Group information? 


**Learn more about how Veterans would like to go about providing updated information - such as financial information or dependents - that could impact their health care benefits after enrollment.**

- Where do Veterans call out as the way to manage their health benefits information like financial updates and copays? 
- Currently, how do Veterans prefer to provide updated financial information (in person at appointments or over the phone)? Ideal state, how would Veteran's prefer to make these updates?
- Do income updates cross benefits in the Veteran's POV or do they associate them only with their health care benefits?
- Would Veterans prefer to be prompted to provide updated financials or do this proactively?
- If notified, how and what method (text, email, call, mail)?
- Where would Veterans expect to find the ability to update their financial income and deductibles online? 
- Is there frustration about steps or processes after the initial application process in regards to providing updated information?
- Does updating dependents seem like a health care benefits tasks or a global task for Veterans to complete? 
- Is updating dependents another common task Veterans are needing to update for their health benefits today?



### Hypothesis
- We assume the overall process of determining eligibility and being placed in a Priority Group is somewhat unclear to Veterans today.
- We assume that Veterans want more information about Priority Groups and transparency about how that impacts their eligibility and benefits.
- We assume not all Veterans go through the enrollment process in one go, there is often stops, such as an exam and other claims filed in between that could impact their enrollment and Priority Group placement. 
- We assume there is a desire from Veterans for the Priority Group placement to be more clear as it pertains to benefits, copays, costs and travel reimbursement.
- We assume that Veterans would like to update their financial information online if it was available but need a clear way to be communicated to or notified that they have to do so.
- We think that Veterans will go to the VA profile to update personal information like financial updates annually.
