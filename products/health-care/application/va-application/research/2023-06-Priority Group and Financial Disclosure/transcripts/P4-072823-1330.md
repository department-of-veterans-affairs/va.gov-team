# Conversation Guide for health care application generative research study around Priority Groups and Financial Disclosure Updates [Health Enrollment Team, 10-10EZ, July 2023]


## Warm-up Questions  - 3 minutes

Let’s start with a couple warm-up questions.

- How long have you been enrolled in and using health care benefits from the VA? Since 2017.
- How often do you visit VA.gov online and do you sign in every time you visit? Yeah, this week I have gone on the website every day because I am checking payment history. I sign in every time. This week I was trying to see when I was going to see when I would be paid my education benefits to see if it was popping up there.
  

## First Topic: [Application Process] - 10 minutes

- Can you explain to me in your own words the process when you applied for health care benefits? It was really easy to apply, but I did not actually know about my benefits or for how long. I enrolled but I didn’t use my healthcare benefits until 2 years ago. I didn’t know that at the time you could schedule your visits on the website, so it seemed like a complicated process, so I didn’t use it. 2-3 years ago, I wanted to start seeing a primary provider within the VA system and they told me I could schedule it online. Since then, I have been using the website for all my healthcare needs.
- [If they don't specify] Did you apply online, in-person or via paper application by yourself? It was online.
- What resources did you use to understand what health care benefits you might qualify for during this process? To be honest if I remember correctly, the application process was maybe 10 questions hit submit so I didn’t know any resources that were available to me.
- How would you describe the process that happened after you completed your application, such as things you had to do, additional information you had to provide, communications from the VA, your first appointment, etc.? I don’t remember receiving anything maybe an email saying thank you for submitting otherwise I don’t remember anything. Maybe I got something in the mail but definitely not a phone call. 
- Now that you have been using your benefits, I would like you to think back and recall if there is anything that would have been helpful for you to know during your application process that you have learned after you enrolled? On that confirmation page after you submit it would have be helpful to see all the benefits listed. Once I walked away from the screen from applying it was out of sight out of mind. It would have been nice to know that information.
- How have you - if at all - been notified since you enrolled that you had to provide updated information? No, other than my secondary insurance no. It was when I went into one of my appointments and they asked and they updated the system while I was there.


### Things to watch for:
- [What terminology does the Veteran use as they talk about their experience?]
- [How does the Veteran portray the overall process - easy, difficult, uneventful?]
- [How does the Veteran describe the process of figuring out what they are eligible for - are they frustrated or do they find it easy?]
- [What does the Veteran call out about the process after the initial application and around managing their benefits?]
- [What pain points or areas of confusion are revealed?]


## Second Topic: [Priority Group - Awareness] - 5 minutes
- Can you tell me more about what Priority Group you are in for your health care benefits now? I actually can’t without logging in. Would you like me to log it? I have no idea.

[If aware of Priority Groups]
- Can you please describe how this was communicated to you and how you understood the impact to you and your benefits?
- Before you completed enrollment, how were you aware of Priority Groups or copays as part of the health care benefits package?
- [if yes] Can you tell me more about what you knew before you applied and how you learned that information?
- Since you have been using your benefits, what have you learned about Priority Groups and the impact it has on you and health care benefits that you wish you knew during the application?

[If NOT aware of Priority Groups, ask question and skip to fourth topic]
- What do you think Priority Groups are? There is no right or wrong answer here, just explain your understanding of what you think it could be and how that is important to health care benefits. I don’t know what they are. I think word of mouth someone mentioned there is a certain priority group that will allow you to schedule appointments online and some that will not, but I do not know if that is correct. I learn a lot about the VA is from word of mouth. The website just has a lot of information and it can be a lot. Would my priority code be under my profile? 
Is that where you would expect to see it? Yes. I see premium. So on the website on the top it says that and I am guessing that is the priority group and when I click on it there is a description on each type of accounts. This is what I was referring to.




### Things to watch for:
- [Do Veterans' confidently know their Priority Group and what that means to them and their benefits?]
- [What is the current process and experience around Priority Groups?]
- [What are the knowledge gaps around Priority Groups and health care costs?]
- [What things would Veterans like to see or like to change in regards to Priority Groups?]

## Third Topic: [Priority Group - Future State] - 5 minutes
- Where are some places that you would like to be able to view your Priority Group number? Why?
- How would this be a benefit to you?
- What type of information is important to you to have access to about your Priority Group and your health care benefits?
- Is there anything you find confusing about how your Priority Group impacts you today that you wish the VA would provide more clarity on?


### Things to watch for:
- [Do Veterans call out VA.gov as where they would expect to find this information? Do they list VA Profile?]
- [Do Veterans mention other channels to find and manage this information - Profile, MHV, mobile, etc?]
- [What information do Veterans want to know about their Priority Group?]


---

## Fourth Topic: [Updates post enrollment] - 5 minutes
- Changing directions a bit now, since you enrolled, have you had to make any updates to your information since your initial application? Address.
- If yes:
   - Can you please tell me more about that. What did you have to update and how was that experience for you? I did it online. I just used VA.gov and went to my profile and updated my address there.
   - How were you notified or how did you find out you needed to supply that updated information? Not that I recall.
   - Is there anything about that experience that you wish you could change? No.
   - Did you have to make updates for other benefits too or just health care?


## [Financial Disclosure] - 5 minutes
- How would you see a change in income impacting your health care benefits? I don’t know. 
- How would you want to be notified to provide your updated financial information? Probably via snail mail through a letter. Yeah, I just feel with emails it gets buried and becomes a last priority. With my healthcare coverage I want that to be a first priority.


## [Dependents] - 5 minutes
- Have you ever had a need to make changes to your dependents for VA benefits? If so, can you tell me more about that experience. No.
- Ideally if you had to make changes to your dependents, can you explain to me how you would go about doing that?


### Things to watch for:
- [What is the current process and pain points when making updates to post enrollment?]
- [What type of information is mentioned as what has been or they could see being updated?]



## Fifth Topic: [EZR Tasks - SCENARIO] - 10 minutes

- I would like to ask if you are comfortable sharing your screen and walking through a task on VA.gov?
- Please be sure to close any personal information, like email, Facebook, etc., before you share your screen.

- For this scenario, you received a communication to update your annual income to maintain your copay and travel reimbursement costs as part of your health care benefits. I would like to ask you to show me where and how you would expect to accomplish this online. 

- [Share link to VA.gov in Zoom chat for VA.gov]


[Notification and process]
- How would you like to receive this communication that you need to provide updated financial information? Mail.
- What would you want to know in this communication about how and why you need to update your financial information? Basically, the why and how it impacts me and my benefits. If I were asked to provide my income, I would want to know how it impacts my healthcare coverage. If there is a range what is that? I want to see if there would be a copay and an estimate on what that could be.
Do you normally sign in through VA.gov on your phone or laptop? I do both, but my phone is just more accessible.


[Where to find]
- Now, from the VA.gov home page, can you walk me through where you would expect to go to update your annual income? So, I would start by going to my name, open the drop down, go to my profile, and I would imagine that is where my personal information was. I would imagine different groupings of personal information, mailing information, income information, etc. into different sections. Just look for Financial Information/Income information. I would scroll and see if there was a place just for income. Yeah, none of these seem like that would apply as updating your income within my own personal information. I would expect the VA would want to know your employer information or a place to input your secondary income information. 
Is there anything else that would be helpful to you about updating your information? No. 
- Please remember to talk aloud about your thought process as you go.
- Can you explain to me why you went [here] to update your financial information?
- Talk to me about where you would expect to find the ability to complete this task and why.
-[Possible prompt to remind them that this task is not available today, but want to know where you would expect to find it if it was made available]

[**IF** they state the would go to the VA Profile to update this information]
- Are you comfortable logging in to your own VA profile account? 
- [If no] Or would you rather have me share my screen and a test account with you and we can talk through the rest of this together?

[Possible prompts]
- What would you be looking for when you first login to update this information? Something in the sidebar or a notification?
- Would you think this fits with any of the existing options or would you expect this to be something new?
- What would you expect this new section to be called?



  

[Backup =  which test account to login to if there are concerns or issues with screen sharing after they state they would update this in Profile?]

- Test user 80


### Things to watch for:
- [Where does the Veteran initially think to go to access this information? Do they validate hypothesis and go to their profile or do they look in other places to update this information?]
- [How does the Veteran expect to find this information from the home page or do they mention notifications or other paths as preferred ways to make these updates?]
- [How does the Veteran want to be communicated to and aware of what they need to do in regards to annual income updates?]
