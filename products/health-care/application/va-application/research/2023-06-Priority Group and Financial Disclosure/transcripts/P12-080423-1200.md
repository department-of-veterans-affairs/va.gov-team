# Conversation Guide for health care application generative research study around Priority Groups and Financial Disclosure Updates [Health Enrollment Team, 10-10EZ, July 2023]


  
## Warm-up Questions  - 3 minutes

Let’s start with a couple warm-up questions.

- How long have you been enrolled in and using health care benefits from the VA? I am trying to think back because I was still on active duty, and I needed glasses. 2019.
- How often do you visit VA.gov online and do you sign in every time you visit? I was quite a bit when I was singing up benefits but not a lot recently. Yeah, I know there is a sign in when you get to the site and a second authentication. 
  

## First Topic: [Application Process] - 10 minutes

- Can you explain to me in your own words the process when you applied for health care benefits? For healthcare I made phone calls I didn’t go online for that, but for disability I did do that online. I called the center and played the phone tag game because of my status. I have gone on afterwards to poke around, but just being a retiree, I do okay with going to civilian doctors.
- [If they don't specify] Did you apply online, in-person or via paper application by yourself?
- What resources did you use to understand what health care benefits you might qualify for during this process? That was more asking questions on the phone and asking my friends what their experiences were. 
Did you do any research on how your benefits would change after you got out? I really didn’t think about that. I am aware of things because of the book they sent me, but I really don’t have need for it right now. I actually did read through the book. I was curious what was out there. It was cool that they were able to tailor to my situation. Outside all the contact numbers I am sure it will be useful, but right now having been seen for all the exams the VA knows the status of my body and I know how to reach out to people and get that process going.
- How would you describe the process that happened after you completed your application, such as things you had to do, additional information you had to provide, communications from the VA, your first appointment, etc.? It was pretty easy. They gave me all the information over the phone. My strongest memory is getting things through the mail. I saw where I could have seen my appointment online. Maybe it is just me, but I didn’t think it was hard and it was easily to navigate.
- Now that you have been using your benefits, I would like you to think back and recall if there is anything that would have been helpful for you to know during your application process that you have learned after you enrolled? Not particularly. I remember after the deployments there was VA rep come and talk to us about enrolling, but it did pertain to me. They should have talked about why it is important to enroll. I am still a little blurry about when I should see the VA providers.
- How have you - if at all - been notified since you enrolled that you had to provide updated information?
I have not been contacted at all to update that. It is possible that a notification has popped up, but I do not recall.

### Things to watch for:
- [What terminology does the Veteran use as they talk about their experience?]
- [How does the Veteran portray the overall process - easy, difficult, uneventful?]
- [How does the Veteran describe the process of figuring out what they are eligible for - are they frustrated or do they find it easy?]
- [What does the Veteran call out about the process after the initial application and around managing their benefits?]
- [What pain points or areas of confusion are revealed?]


## Second Topic: [Priority Group - Awareness] - 5 minutes
- Can you tell me more about what Priority Group you are in for your health care benefits now?
Surprisingly I was Priority Group 1 because of my rating. I don’t really know what that means. Maybe that gets me seen sooner I don’t recall what I read about that.
[If aware of Priority Groups]
- Can you please describe how this was communicated to you and how you understood the impact on you and your benefits? Yeah, that is fair. I still have the book so I can always reference that. I remember it was in the book. It was very tailored and very clear. No, it was brand-new to me when I applied.
- Before you completed enrollment, how were you aware of Priority Groups or copays as part of the health care benefits package?
- [if yes] Can you tell me more about what you knew before you applied and how you learned that information?
- Since you have been using your benefits, what have you learned about Priority Groups and the impact it has on you and health care benefits that you wish you knew during the application?

[If NOT aware of Priority Groups, ask question and skip to fourth topic]
- What do you think Priority Groups are? There is no right or wrong answer here, just explain your understanding of what you think it could be and how that is important to health care benefits. 




### Things to watch for:
- [Do Veterans' confidently know their Priority Group and what that means to them and their benefits?]
- [What is the current process and experience around Priority Groups?]
- [What are the knowledge gaps around Priority Groups and health care costs?]
- [What things would Veterans like to see or like to change in regards to Priority Groups?]

## Third Topic: [Priority Group - Future State] - 5 minutes
- Where are some places that you would like to be able to view your Priority Group number? Why? 
You know I don’t. I think just my general profile. If it was somewhere in there. It is nothing for me right now. I feel like under my general profile would work. 
- How would this be a benefit to you?
- What type of information is important to you to have access to about your Priority Group and your health care benefits?
- Is there anything you find confusing about how your Priority Group impacts you today that you wish the VA would provide more clarity on?
I think it circles back to that is there something I should be seeing the VA for if I am not using the VA for my general healthcare. 


### Things to watch for:
- [Do Veterans call out VA.gov as where they would expect to find this information? Do they list VA Profile?]
- [Do Veterans mention other channels to find and manage this information - Profile, MHV, mobile, etc?]
- [What information do Veterans want to know about their Priority Group?]

## Fourth Topic: [Updates post enrollment] - 5 minutes
- Changing directions a bit now, since you enrolled, have you had to make any updates to your information since your initial application?
I did. I know I had to add my family it and definitely an address change. I had to do the burn pit registry, I found that to be a pain in the beginning and had to go in and changed some timelines.
- If yes:
   - Can you please tell me more about that. What did you have to update and how was that experience for you? The dependency I remember because I had to fill out other paperwork to get my family to add on to my disability. I had to upload additional paperwork to prove they are my family. Is the VA supposed to pull information from DEERS?
I am not aware of that program. It is just a program that keeps track of all your family information.
   - How were you notified or how did you find out you needed to supply that updated information?
   - Is there anything about that experience that you wish you could change?
   - Did you have to make updates for other benefits too or just health care?


## [Financial Disclosure] - 5 minutes
- How would you see a change in income impacting your health care benefits? For my personal situation I don’t see it impacting me because I have Tricare until I am 60-something. 
- How would you want to be notified to provide your updated financial information? Ideally, I would like to get an email that prompts me to go onto the website to update that information. That is just the way I like to operate. Either an email or text message.


## [Dependents] - 5 minutes
- Have you ever had a need to make changes to your dependents for VA benefits? If so, can you tell me more about that experience. 
- Ideally if you had to make changes to your dependents, can you explain to me how you would go about doing that? Having to do it I don’t know what you could do to change it. I only brought up DEERS because the VA knew a lot about my service. I am just surprised that it doesn’t have access to that information as well.


### Things to watch for:
- [What is the current process and pain points when making updates to post enrollment?]
- [What type of information is mentioned as what has been or they could see being updated?]



## Fifth Topic: [EZR Tasks - SCENARIO] - 10 minutes

- I would like to ask if you are comfortable sharing your screen and walking through a task on VA.gov? Sure.
- Please be sure to close any personal information, like email, Facebook, etc., before you share your screen.

- For this scenario, you received a communication to update your annual income to maintain your copay and travel reimbursement costs as part of your health care benefits. I would like to ask you to show me where and how you would expect to accomplish this online. 

- [Share link to VA.gov in Zoom chat for VA.gov]


[Notification and process]
- How would you like to receive this communication that you need to provide updated financial information? Email or text.
- What would you want to know in this communication about how and why you need to update your financial information? I would always be suspicious of links, but I just want to know where to go to update that information.
Any thing else? If there are any documents needed would be helpful, but it is okay if it tells me on the page as well.

[Where to find]
- Now, from the VA.gov home page, can you walk me through where you would expect to go to update your annual income? Probably whatever page that has been set up to start that process. I can’t think where else you would want to go. Or if you were on the main home screen. I am guessing it would be under the profile or a profile option. 
Why do you think it makes sense for the profile? It is just general information about you. If it is needed somewhere else so I figured it would be pulled from your profile.
- Please remember to talk aloud about your thought process as you go.
- Can you explain to me why you went [here] to update your financial information? Another link is under here.
What would you name it? If it is just looking for financial information, financial profile. 
Since you have made updates to other benefits throughout VA, would you expect if you updated financial information here would you think it would update on other benefits? I would expect that, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it didn’t because it is a government site.
Would you expect it to be within the naming of it or explanation of the context? I would probably set expectations a little bit better. Healthcare financial information. 
- Talk to me about where you would expect to find the ability to complete this task and why.
-[Possible prompt to remind them that this task is not available today, but want to know where you would expect to find it if it was made available]

[**IF** they state the would go to the VA Profile to update this information]
- Are you comfortable logging in to your own VA profile account? 
- [If no] Or would you rather have me share my screen and a test account with you and we can talk through the rest of this together?

[Possible prompts]
- What would you be looking for when you first login to update this information? Something in the sidebar or a notification?
- Would you think these fits with any of the existing options or would you expect this to be something new?
- What would you expect this new section to be called?



  

[Backup =  which test account to login to if there are concerns or issues with screen sharing after they state they would update this in Profile?]

- Test user 80


### Things to watch for:
- [Where does the Veteran initially think to go to access this information? Do they validate hypothesis and go to their profile or do they look in other places to update this information?]
- [How does the Veteran expect to find this information from the home page or do they mention notifications or other paths as preferred ways to make these updates?]
- [How does the Veteran want to be communicated to and aware of what they need to do in regards to annual income updates?]

## Post-Task Interview - 2 minutes

- Is there anything else you would like to add about what we talked about today? I do have a lot on my phone, I do find the app a little bit limiting which I would have to come to the desktop to do things. It would be nice for it to be a little bit more user-friendly on the phones or tablets. I couldn’t get it to work, and I didn’t think it was important enough to keep going. It was the security layers that I couldn’t get into. I would find it more useful if I could do more through the app. Overall, I find the site easy to navigate.
Were you able to get into it at all? It’s been a while so I can’t speak on that. 
- Any questions for me? I do not have any.
