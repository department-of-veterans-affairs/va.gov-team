# Conversation Guide for health care application generative research study around Priority Groups and Financial Disclosure Updates [Health Enrollment Team, 10-10EZ, July 2023]


  
## Warm-up Questions  - 3 minutes

Let’s start with a couple warm-up questions.

- How long have you been enrolled in and using health care benefits from the VA? Probably 7+ years.
- How often do you visit VA.gov online and do you sign in every time you visit? Maybe every couple time a month and I usually don’t sign in unless it is required for what I am doing.
  

## First Topic: [Application Process] - 10 minutes

- Can you explain to me in your own words the process when you applied for health care benefits? It was so long ago. I think it was an application, but I know it was not online it was a paper application.
- [If they don't specify] Did you apply online, in-person or via paper application by yourself? 
- What resources did you use to understand what health care benefits you might qualify for during this process? Just the person who was there in general. To be honest, I think it was 2010ish when I started using my healthcare benefit and they would just print off and give me my information that way.
- How would you describe the process that happened after you completed your application, such as things you had to do, additional information you had to provide, communications from the VA, your first appointment, etc.? Yeah I do recall receiving letters, but they would be expired. I do remember that my first appointment was scheduled by them and they never contacted me about it so I missed it.
- Now that you have been using your benefits, I would like you to think back and recall if there is anything that would have been helpful for you to know during your application process that you have learned after you enrolled? Probably everything because I didn’t know anything when I got out of the military. The packages were very umbrella.
- How have you - if at all - been notified since you enrolled that you had to provide updated information?
I don’t think I have ever had to update my information besides when I go in person to an appointment they verify my address, insurance, and my Emergency contact.

### Things to watch for:
- [What terminology does the Veteran use as they talk about their experience?]
- [How does the Veteran portray the overall process - easy, difficult, uneventful?]
- [How does the Veteran describe the process of figuring out what they are eligible for - are they frustrated or do they find it easy?]
- [What does the Veteran call out about the process after the initial application and around managing their benefits?]
- [What pain points or areas of confusion are revealed?]


## Second Topic: [Priority Group - Awareness] - 5 minutes
- Can you tell me more about what Priority Group you are in for your health care benefits now?
1 I think, but I am not really sure I just know it is the highest group.
[If aware of Priority Groups]
- Can you please describe how this was communicated to you and how you understood the impact to you and your benefits?
- Before you completed enrollment, how were you aware of Priority Groups or copays as part of the health care benefits package?
- [if yes] Can you tell me more about what you knew before you applied and how you learned that information?
- Since you have been using your benefits, what have you learned about Priority Groups and the impact it has on you and health care benefits that you wish you knew during the application?

[If NOT aware of Priority Groups, ask question and skip to fourth topic]
- What do you think Priority Groups are? There is no right or wrong answer here, just explain your understanding of what you think it could be and how that is important to health care benefits. 

From my understanding it is based on your disability and how you are ranked within the priority groups.


### Things to watch for:
- [Do Veterans' confidently know their Priority Group and what that means to them and their benefits?]
- [What is the current process and experience around Priority Groups?]
- [What are the knowledge gaps around Priority Groups and health care costs?]
- [What things would Veterans like to see or like to change in regards to Priority Groups?]

## Third Topic: [Priority Group - Future State] - 5 minutes
- Where are some places that you would like to be able to view your Priority Group number? Why? I would want to know how important it is because I have never really needed to know besides once or twice. Now if I sign into MyHealtheVet it would be nice to see that near my health information. Personally, I think using MHV and VA would make more sense for me.
- How would this be a benefit to you? Again, if it is important to my health but I am not sure how important it really is.
- What type of information is important to you to have access to about your Priority Group and your health care benefits? I guess in your profile. Shows your name, your data, and then in line with it  because there is so much information it would get lost.
- Is there anything you find confusing about how your Priority Group impacts you today that you wish the VA would provide more clarity on? I guess just finding out what a priority number is, why it is important *Zoom Froze*


### Things to watch for:
- [Do Veterans call out VA.gov as where they would expect to find this information? Do they list VA Profile?]
- [Do Veterans mention other channels to find and manage this information - Profile, MHV, mobile, etc?]
- [What information do Veterans want to know about their Priority Group?]

## Fourth Topic: [Updates post enrollment] - 5 minutes
- Changing directions a bit now, since you enrolled, have you had to make any updates to your information since your initial application? Another thing I know they ask about is updating my insurance when I check into my appointments by the kiosk. I can’t remember anything else about receiving a letter or anything like that. 
- If yes:
   - Can you please tell me more about that. What did you have to update and how was that experience for you? It was very simple, just clicked edit and entered the information. 
   - How were you notified or how did you find out you needed to supply that updated information?
   - Is there anything about that experience that you wish you could change? Not really, it was 30 seconds, and I was done. I thought it was pretty good. 
   - Did you have to make updates for other benefits too or just health care?


## [Financial Disclosure] - 5 minutes
- How would you see a change in income impacting your health care benefits? I would say the VA is not my first line when it comes to my medical. I was laid off, so I am now relying on the VA more now.
- How would you want to be notified to provide your updated financial information? I think an email would be best because VA letters are very behind. I think an email where I can click a link where I can just update the information. I check my email a million times a day.


## [Dependents] - 5 minutes
- Have you ever had a need to make changes to your dependents for VA benefits? If so, can you tell me more about that experience. Yeah, I just did it last December. I was shocked at how easy it was. Went to a page, entered the information, and I month later it was updated. 
- Ideally if you had to make changes to your dependents, can you explain to me how you would go about doing that? The only difference is I was married previously but he was never my dependent. There was a lot of information that was not important to me now. I wasn’t sure why they were asking me now.


### Things to watch for:
- [What is the current process and pain points when making updates to post enrollment?]
- [What type of information is mentioned as what has been or they could see being updated?]



## Fifth Topic: [EZR Tasks - SCENARIO] - 10 minutes

- I would like to ask if you are comfortable sharing your screen and walking through a task on VA.gov? Yes, just bear with me trying to figure that out with my new Mac.
- Please be sure to close any personal information, like email, Facebook, etc., before you share your screen.

- For this scenario, you received a communication to update your annual income to maintain your copay and travel reimbursement costs as part of your health care benefits. I would like to ask you to show me where and how you would expect to accomplish this online.  

- [Share link to VA.gov in Zoom chat for VA.gov]


[Notification and process]
- How would you like to receive this communication that you need to provide updated financial information? For me it would be email, text would be ideal, but an email is just as impactful. 
- What would you want to know in this communication about how and why you need to update your financial information? I am a straight shooting so I just want them to tell me they want me to update the information, link to where to go, and why they want the information. 

[Where to find]
- Now, from the VA.gov home page, can you walk me through where you would expect to go to update your annual income? First sign in if I can remember my password. Once I log in, I’d go to my profile. 
- Please remember to talk aloud about your thought process as you go.
- Can you explain to me why you went [here] to update your financial information? No reason, I just assumed it would be under my profile because that is where I would always go to update any information like that. I would assume there would be another tab that says income/financial because all the other basic information is. Income Verification, I like to break it down Barney style. 
What kind of information would you expect to see near that? I think it is very similar to banking, where do you work, how much do you make a year, some context to why you would even need that. It makes me a little skeptical to why do you need to know how much money I make. 
- Talk to me about where you would expect to find the ability to complete this task and why.
-[Possible prompt to remind them that this task is not available today, but want to know where you would expect to find it if it was made available]

[**IF** they state the would go to the VA Profile to update this information]
- Are you comfortable logging in to your own VA profile account? 
- [If no] Or would you rather have me share my screen and a test account with you and we can talk through the rest of this together?

[Possible prompts]
- What would you be looking for when you first login to update this information? Something in the sidebar or a notification?
- Would you think this fits with any of the existing options or would you expect this to be something new?
- What would you expect this new section to be called?




### Things to watch for:
- [Where does the Veteran initially think to go to access this information? Do they validate hypothesis and go to their profile or do they look in other places to update this information?]
- [How does the Veteran expect to find this information from the home page or do they mention notifications or other paths as preferred ways to make these updates?]
- [How does the Veteran want to be communicated to and aware of what they need to do in regards to annual income updates?]

## Post-Task Interview - 2 minutes

- Is there anything else you would like to add about what we talked about today? It feels like sometimes VA webpage does not have very much information and the number they provide you does not have any information about it either. I wouldn’t provide resources unless everyone is trained on what the information on the webpage is not cleared. That happened recently to me and it was very frustrating.
- Any questions for me? No, I am pretty good. Thank
