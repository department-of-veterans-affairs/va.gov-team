# Conversation Guide for health care application generative research study around Priority Groups and Financial Disclosure Updates [Health Enrollment Team, 10-10EZ, July 2023]


## Warm-up Questions  - 3 minutes

Let’s start with a couple warm-up questions.

- How long have you been enrolled in and using health care benefits from the VA? I have been enrolled and using it since 2018.
- How often do you visit VA.gov online and do you sign in every time you visit? I use it about 2 times a week and I do sign in every time. I use the ID.me, I think, to sign in.
  

## First Topic: [Application Process] - 10 minutes

- Can you explain to me in your own words the process when you applied for health care benefits? I remember not knowing all the answers to the questions. I got out in 2015 and didn’t know I could apply for benefits until I started working with a VA help services when I was in school. I didn’t know what kind of Veteran I was. I guess and then asked the people who were familiar with it, and they walked me through it. The Veteran Center was on campus of the community college I was attending. 
- [If they don't specify] Did you apply online, in-person or via paper application by yourself?
- What resources did you use to understand what health care benefits you might qualify for during this process? I think because I was deployed in a combat zone, I was eligible for 5 years, but I did not know. I was just waiting for things to get better. Once I got my physical, I found out I was closer to VA satellite offices near me. It was all new to me. They were helpful with explaining categories, prescriptions, and copays. They gave a lot of information, just not at once though. When I asked, they would give it to me. I was learning in the process. 
Can you explain more about categories? I know there is Category 1 – 5 and it will tell you if you have a copay or not. When I first found out I didn’t know they were healthcare, then I thought it was free, then I found out that it was only free for a limited amount of time. Just stuff how we would use it. I did my application twice, I did it once and I was waiting to get a card in the mail and I thought I had to wait for it until I could use it. It sat for about 8 months. When I got with the Veteran Center they educated me and I did a fresh application. 
- How would you describe the process that happened after you completed your application, such as things you had to do, additional information you had to provide, communications from the VA, your first appointment, etc.? Actually about the card I didn’t get a card until about 3 months ago and that was years ago. It said I would get one in the mail, but I didn’t. Then I was told I needed to go into the VA and no one could tell me where to go. I did it online during Covid and I got it in the mail. I never got a booklet that is funny you said something about a booklet. I am not sure what booklet you are talking about. 
- Now that you have been using your benefits, I would like you to think back and recall if there is anything that would have been helpful for you to know during your application process that you have learned after you enrolled? I think just what the next steps were. Enrolling felt a little confusing because it was online, but if there was a person to talk to and ask questions so you know how to use it. I ended up contacting the Veteran Center to ask all my questions. 
- How have you - if at all - been notified since you enrolled that you had to provide updated information? It happened once. I thought it would be a yearly thing since I applied for enrollment, but I did get a tax paper to update my private insurance. At the time I was thinking VA is my primary insurance. Now I have a job where they provide me with insurance but I don’t want to learn how to use anything different.


### Things to watch for:
- [What terminology does the Veteran use as they talk about their experience?]
- [How does the Veteran portray the overall process - easy, difficult, uneventful?]
- [How does the Veteran describe the process of figuring out what they are eligible for - are they frustrated or do they find it easy?]
- [What does the Veteran call out about the process after the initial application and around managing their benefits?]
- [What pain points or areas of confusion are revealed?]


## Second Topic: [Priority Group - Awareness] - 5 minutes
- Can you tell me more about what Priority Group you are in for your health care benefits now? When I got rated 70% with Category 1 if you are 50% you don’t have a copay for your medications. I got my prescription in the mail. If I needed something over the counter, I don’t know how that would work so I do not use it that way. As far as getting prescription medication I get that free. I think I use most of my benefits as far as I know, but I also don’t know if I use all my benefits. Like dental, I don’t know if I qualify for that or if that is something else, I need to apply for. I have always gotten mixed answers when asking about dental. They told me to go to an enrollment office and they didn’t know either.

[If aware of Priority Groups]
- Can you please describe how this was communicated to you and how you understood the impact on you and your benefits? It wasn’t really communicated to me; I saw it on the VA website. I clicked on pay your bill and I started clicking around the website. I Google VA bill and found a link and found it that way. Now it is updated so I can find all kinds of information. I use it often.
Did you ask others about the priority groups at all? I did, but most of them had a very high disability rating so they didn’t want to talk about it or they didn’t know because they were 100% and didn’t know anything else because it didn’t pertain to them.
- Before you completed enrollment, how were you aware of Priority Groups or copays as part of the health care benefits package?
- [if yes] Can you tell me more about what you knew before you applied and how you learned that information?
- Since you have been using your benefits, what have you learned about Priority Groups and the impact it has on you and health care benefits that you wish you knew during the application?

[If NOT aware of Priority Groups, ask question and skip to fourth topic]
- What do you think Priority Groups are? There is no right or wrong answer here, just explain your understanding of what you think it could be and how that is important to health care benefits. 




### Things to watch for:
- [Do Veterans' confidently know their Priority Group and what that means to them and their benefits?]
- [What is the current process and experience around Priority Groups?]
- [What are the knowledge gaps around Priority Groups and health care costs?]
- [What things would Veterans like to see or like to change in regards to Priority Groups?]

## Third Topic: [Priority Group - Future State] - 5 minutes
- Where are some places that you would like to be able to view your Priority Group number? Why? Maybe on my card because I know where to find it online and how it is broken down makes sense. If you just are told what category I am so I would be able to see which one to look at instead of looking at all of them. I just looked online at VA.gov but I don’t know where exactly to find my category. It would be helpful because all the information I have gotten from the VA has been word of mouth. I would be able to help someone figure it out if it is on your card and then you can go over your benefits. Just label it.
Where on the site would you like to find your number? Where I think it should be there is a place where you can change your address, it would be nice to see it there. My name, category, and then if it is wrong maybe I could submit the documents to fix it.
- How would this be a benefit to you?
- What type of information is important to you to have access to about your Priority Group and your health care benefits?
- Is there anything you find confusing about how your Priority Group impacts you today that you wish the VA would provide more clarity on?


### Things to watch for:
- [Do Veterans call out VA.gov as where they would expect to find this information? Do they list VA Profile?]
- [Do Veterans mention other channels to find and manage this information - Profile, MHV, mobile, etc?]
- [What information do Veterans want to know about their Priority Group?]

## Fourth Topic: [Updates post enrollment] - 5 minutes
- Changing directions, a bit now, since you enrolled, have you had to make any updates to your information since your initial application? I have had to update my private healthcare and private dental as well as my address. I have updated that information, but I have never gotten a response or how they were using that information. The importance of updating isn’t communicated. I guess it might be out there, but because I have gotten something in the mail about updating healthcare and consent notices in the mail. The VA sends a lot of mail.
- If yes:
   - Can you please tell me more about that. What did you have to update and how was that experience for you?
   - How were you notified or how did you find out you needed to supply that updated information? I just got them in the mail; besides that I never got a phone call. The reason I am more proactive is because when I got out of the military a friend got out as well. He ended up scattering his ankle and not having healthcare, so I am updating because I do not want to have a bill, I can’t pay. 
   - Is there anything about that experience that you wish you could change?
   - Did you have to make updates for other benefits too or just health care? When I was using the GI Bill, I updated from one school to another. I think over the phone. I call the benefits line. Then I called to see how to make an update when I have a dependent. Otherwise, nothing else.


## [Financial Disclosure] - 5 minutes
- How would you see a change in income impacting your health care benefits? Personally, I don’t think it would impact my benefits, but I think if I did not have a disability rating it would. It might. Wait, I do know, on that same thing it tells you to update your income to place you in the proper category. 
- How would you want to be notified to provide your updated financial information? I think maybe when I go to an appointment, they will start doing a questionnaire about your experience, if they would have that information on there as well to get updated. I would pay more attention to the VA if it came in the mail. Because I use the VA.gov so much it would be nice to have a red thing on top to tell you what you need to update. Something that sticks out and you would not be able to ignore.


## [Dependents] - 5 minutes
- Have you ever had a need to make changes to your dependents for VA benefits? If so, can you tell me more about that experience. 
- Ideally if you had to make changes to your dependents, can you explain to me how you would go about doing that? I would use VA.gov, but at the same time my boyfriend is a Veteran, so I am not sure if I need to add him or not. If I had children, I think I would look into what I needed to do to add them and what they are covered by.


### Things to watch for:
- [What is the current process and pain points when making updates to post enrollment?]
- [What type of information is mentioned as what has been or they could see being updated?]



## Fifth Topic: [EZR Tasks - SCENARIO] - 10 minutes

- I would like to ask if you are comfortable sharing your screen and walking through a task on VA.gov? Yes.
- Please be sure to close any personal information, like email, Facebook, etc., before you share your screen.

- For this scenario, you received a communication to update your annual income to maintain your copay and travel reimbursement costs as part of your health care benefits. I would like to ask you to show me where and how you would expect to accomplish this online. 

- [Share link to VA.gov in Zoom chat for VA.gov]


[Notification and process]
- How would you like to receive this communication that you need to provide updated financial information? When you worded that it is for my travel pay so I wouldn’t come here. I don’t think I would ever look for it here. I would like to get those notifications in my profile messages.
- What would you want to know in this communication about how and why you need to update your financial information? I guess I don’t know anything about updating anything about my financial information besides how much I make, tell me how often I should be doing it because the first time may be hard to find it.

[Where to find]
- Now, from the VA.gov home page, can you walk me through where you would expect to go to update your annual income? My profile, so this is where I meant somewhere here. I use the health part more. My profile, I would want it to be somewhere here. This is where I would go if I needed to update my mailing address or something like that.
- Please remember to talk aloud about your thought process as you go.
- Can you explain to me why you went [here] to update your financial information? Now I don’t want it to be here because it looks different than when it looked the last time, I updated my stuff. 
Where are you trying to get to? There is a place where it shows your profile, your address, your phone number. This is where I would change all my information. That is probably how long it would have taken me to find it. It is just where I know where to go to change my address, so it makes sense to be able to change any other personal information. 
- Talk to me about where you would expect to find the ability to complete this task and why.
-[Possible prompt to remind them that this task is not available today, but want to know where you would expect to find it if it was made available]

[**IF** they state the would go to the VA Profile to update this information]
- Are you comfortable logging in to your own VA profile account? 
- [If no] Or would you rather have me share my screen and a test account with you and we can talk through the rest of this together?

[Possible prompts]
- What would you be looking for when you first login to update this information? Something in the sidebar or a notification?
- Would you think these fit with any of the existing options or would you expect this to be something new?
- What would you expect this new section to be called? Maybe if it says something like Enrollment Information. When I was thinking about this interview, I couldn’t remember what questions I was asked. So, it would be nice to know what the VA knows. I don’t know if anyone got it. It is nice to know this is a yearly thing and everything is here.





### Things to watch for:
- [Where does the Veteran initially think to go to access this information? Do they validate hypothesis and go to their profile or do they look in other places to update this information?]
- [How does the Veteran expect to find this information from the home page or do they mention notifications or other paths as preferred ways to make these updates?]
- [How does the Veteran want to be communicated to and aware of what they need to do in regards to annual income updates?]

## Post-Task Interview - 2 minutes

- Is there anything else you would like to add about what we talked about today? I don’t think so. I think it would be helpful if there was a how to set on the VA website because I have Veteran friends who don’t use it and I don’t know if I would be able to tell them how to do it because it may be different than what I had to do. I do tell them go to enrollment registration and they do not get a lot of answers there. It would be a guide for how to enroll. Here is the link and don’t wait for your card, here is the numbers you need, and links to other services that you may be able to use. Have information about updating information and how often.
- Any questions for me? I don’t think so. Does that stuff I talk about exist? I know it has been a while since I enrolled, is there besides the certain form about enrolling, is there a link online? 
There is a link to enroll in healthcare. 
What about without a profile for those who do not know how to set up an online profile? I notice the website is constantly changing.
