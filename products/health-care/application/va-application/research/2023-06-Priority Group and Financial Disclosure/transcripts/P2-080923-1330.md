# Conversation Guide for health care application generative research study around Priority Groups and Financial Disclosure Updates [Health Enrollment Team, 10-10EZ, July 2023]



  
## Warm-up Questions  - 3 minutes

Let’s start with a couple warm-up questions.

- How long have you been enrolled in and using health care benefits from the VA? I retired in October of 22 and I started switching over from Tricare to VA in January. 
- How often do you visit VA.gov online and do you sign in every time you visit? So, I check the app, which is pretty user friendly, and I can pull my secure messages, pull letters, the only thing the app doesn’t have is my patient notes. If it included that it would be a one stop shop. I only visit websites because I need my patient notes, and I do log in.
  

## First Topic: [Application Process] - 10 minutes

- Can you explain to me in your own words the process when you applied for health care benefits? I was a little late. I didn’t get the BDD, I missed it because I knew too much. I had a VSO who required me to have all my records on a USB to begin my process. I had to have my appointment before July 1, but I missed that window. My experience with that VSO was smooth other than he required me to have all my records. My experience was so smooth because the VSO was so helpful and did everything besides getting my records. The waiting was horrible. I was checking the VA app often just to check. There was an estimated date, but that date never changed. I retired October 1, and didn’t hear anything until mid-January. BBD- Benefit before departure you can sometimes get your rating prior to you getting out of the military. 
- [If they don't specify] Did you apply online, in-person or via paper application by yourself?
- What resources did you use to understand what health care benefits you might qualify for during this process? Mainly my colleagues. Word of mouth was huge, and it was helpful that my husband retired a few years before me. He is the one who told me about the VSO and the BBD. I talked to other people, and they just told me to stay on top of it. Honestly the VSO was the biggest help. I guess going to TAP class helped.
- How would you describe the process that happened after you completed your application, such as things you had to do, additional information you had to provide, communications from the VA, your first appointment, etc.? Once it was submitted for all my noted conditions I started getting all this mail giving me appointments. I had about 9 appointments throughout the DC area. The appointments were everyone with no rhythms or reasons. That is a little burden. My boss let me go, but as an active duty person and that would be an hour drive without traffic. I was allowed to miss my appointment but if I missed more than one I would have to start all over. I remember there were several that were back to back that were hours away from each other and I wouldn’t be able to make it. If you are going to have that rule you should space out the appointments.
Anything else do you remember about that part of the process? I mentioned the drives were a burden. In general, the clinics that were selected were good clinics. All the providers were good providers. I don’t have any complaints about that.
- Now that you have been using your benefits, I would like you to think back and recall if there is anything that would have been helpful for you to know during your application process that you have learned after you enrolled? I wish I would have known ahead of time how fast those appointments would have come. I wish there was a way that the individual could go in and select the appointments. It was a waste of time in multiple avenues. If there was a way to call in and schedule appointments that would be best. I would have been happy to fill out all those forms online as well. If I didn’t have my husband I would have been more lost. He told me about the app and the same with the VSO. He went through the process and years later I went through the process. If there was a step by step guide online that would be great. 
- How have you - if at all - been notified since you enrolled that you had to provide updated information?
I get pretty good appointment updates via email or the app. What is terrible and wasteful is I get these mail reminders which sometimes arrive after the appointment has already happened. Everyone with a cellphone you should give them an option to opt out of the mail reminders and just get a push notifications. 

### Things to watch for:
- [What terminology does the Veteran use as they talk about their experience?]
- [How does the Veteran portray the overall process - easy, difficult, uneventful?]
- [How does the Veteran describe the process of figuring out what they are eligible for - are they frustrated or do they find it easy?]
- [What does the Veteran call out about the process after the initial application and around managing their benefits?]
- [What pain points or areas of confusion are revealed?]


## Second Topic: [Priority Group - Awareness] - 5 minutes
- Can you tell me more about what Priority Group you are in for your health care benefits now?
I don’t know exactly my group. I think because. You tell me, if I am 100% does that make me priority one?
I am not going to tell you because I want to get your opinion on what it is.
[If aware of Priority Groups]
- Can you please describe how this was communicated to you and how you understood the impact on you and your benefits?
- Before you completed enrollment, how were you aware of Priority Groups or copays as part of the health care benefits package?
- [if yes] Can you tell me more about what you knew before you applied and how you learned that information?
- Since you have been using your benefits, what have you learned about Priority Groups and the impact it has on you and health care benefits that you wish you knew during the application?

[If NOT aware of Priority Groups, ask question and skip to fourth topic]
- What do you think Priority Groups are? There is no right or wrong answer here, just explain your understanding of what you think it could be and how that is important to health care benefits. 
I would imagine if you were 100% rated that makes you priority one and if you are not rated, I don’t really know the different priority. I know you can still enroll in the healthcare if you are not rated, I just don’t know what the groups mean. I am sure I can go online and look it up.
Do you remember reading about priority groups? The information is there from TAPS class but if the information does not imply me, I make an effort to not remember it. I know the resource is there for me to go back and look it up if I need to.



### Things to watch for:
- [Do Veterans' confidently know their Priority Group and what that means to them and their benefits?]
- [What is the current process and experience around Priority Groups?]
- [What are the knowledge gaps around Priority Groups and health care costs?]
- [What things would Veterans like to see or like to change in regards to Priority Groups?]

## Third Topic: [Priority Group - Future State] - 5 minutes
- Where are some places that you would like to be able to view your Priority Group number? Why?
- How would this be a benefit to you?
- What type of information is important to you to have access to about your Priority Group and your health care benefits?
- Is there anything you find confusing about how your Priority Group impacts you today that you wish the VA would provide more clarity on?


### Things to watch for:
- [Do Veterans call out VA.gov as where they would expect to find this information? Do they list VA Profile?]
- [Do Veterans mention other channels to find and manage this information - Profile, MHV, mobile, etc?]
- [What information do Veterans want to know about their Priority Group?]


---

## Fourth Topic: [Updates post enrollment] - 5 minutes
- Changing directions a bit now, since you enrolled, have you had to make any updates to your information since your initial application? I changed my address, and I used the app for that. It was very easy. Personal information wise,  nope.
- If yes:
   - Can you please tell me more about that. What did you have to update and how was that experience for you?
   - How were you notified or how did you find out you needed to supply that updated information?
   - Is there anything about that experience that you wish you could change? I think this app could be more powerful. Like I said under the health tab I would love to see my notes. Like make this a one stop portal. If they could just add a tab for results and notes. 
   - Did you have to make updates for other benefits too or just health care?


## [Financial Disclosure] - 5 minutes
- How would you see a change in income impacting your health care benefits? For me it doesn’t matter because I have 100%. For others I can imagine they would rely on it more because of the copays that may vary with your income. I love that you mail prescriptions, that is my favorite feature. 
- How would you want to be notified to provide your updated financial information?


## [Dependents] - 5 minutes
- Have you ever had a need to make changes to your dependents for VA benefits? If so, can you tell me more about that experience. For me as a retiree, I qualify for Tricare Prime, and I purchased that for my children. That is a huge advantage to be able to use Tricare Prime. I made sure to enroll them as soon as I retired.
- Ideally if you had to make changes to your dependents, can you explain to me how you would go about doing that?


### Things to watch for:
- [What is the current process and pain points when making updates to post enrollment?]
- [What type of information is mentioned as what has been or they could see being updated?]



## Fifth Topic: [EZR Tasks - SCENARIO] - 10 minutes

- I would like to ask if you are comfortable sharing your screen and walking through a task on VA.gov? Yeah.
- Please be sure to close any personal information, like email, Facebook, etc., before you share your screen.

- For this scenario, you received a communication to update your annual income to maintain your copay and travel reimbursement costs as part of your health care benefits. I would like to ask you to show me where and how you would expect to accomplish this online. 

- [Share link to VA.gov in Zoom chat for VA.gov]


[Notification and process]
- How would you like to receive this communication that you need to provide updated financial information? It depends if I am a reliable email, I would want an email with a link to take me straight to the website. If I were older, I would want it by mail. A text would be fine, that would be number one choice. That’s it.
- What would you want to know in this communication about how and why you need to update your financial information?

[Where to find]
- Now, from the VA.gov home page, can you walk me through where you would expect to go to update your annual income?
- Please remember to talk aloud about your thought process as you go.
- Can you explain to me why you went [here] to update your financial information?
- Talk to me about where you would expect to find the ability to complete this task and why.
-[Possible prompt to remind them that this task is not available today, but want to know where you would expect to find it if it was made available]

[**IF** they state the would go to the VA Profile to update this information]
- Are you comfortable logging in to your own VA profile account? 
- [If no] Or would you rather have me share my screen and a test account with you and we can talk through the rest of this together?

[Possible prompts]
- What would you be looking for when you first login to update this information? Something in the sidebar or a notification?
- Would you think this fits with any of the existing options or would you expect this to be something new?
- What would you expect this new section to be called?



  

[Backup =  which test account to login to if there are concerns or issues with screen sharing after they state they would update this in Profile?] I would want a banner to remind me to update my financial information, and I want the banner to stop me from doing anything else if I try to ignore it. I would imagine my financial information would be under my profile. It makes sense because it is me and my information. 
What would you want it to be called? Annual Income Update, Current Income Update, or Financial Hardship. Something along those lines so that Veteran who may be experiencing hardship could get the help they need.

- Test user 80


### Things to watch for:
- [Where does the Veteran initially think to go to access this information? Do they validate hypothesis and go to their profile or do they look in other places to update this information?]
- [How does the Veteran expect to find this information from the home page or do they mention notifications or other paths as preferred ways to make these updates?]
- [How does the Veteran want to be communicated to and aware of what they need to do in regards to annual income updates?]

## Post-Task Interview - 2 minutes

- Is there anything else you would like to add about what we talked about today? I don’t know if this has to do with your group, but I have a bone to pick. I will get it, and I feel like it is a trick. I will have a referral and I will call the number, and no one ever picks up. No one. I think I am pretty good at navigating. I will leave a message, and no one calls me back. It then makes me have to write a secure message. Then I will get a letter in the mail stating they tried to call me to make an appointment and then they give me the number that I called initially. I always pick up the VA. I feel like people are sending out these letters without really contacting the Veterans. If I am experiencing this how many other people are experiencing this and they don’t understand. I feel like someone is not doing their job and they really aren’t calling. The Triage Nurses’ hotline is amazing also. They will help me get in whenever they feel I need to get in.
- Any questions for me? I don’t. Thank you for trying to make the app better. Also if you could add the common contact information so you will not have to search it online.
