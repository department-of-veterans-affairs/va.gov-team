# Conversation Guide for health care application generative research study around Priority Groups and Financial Disclosure Updates [Health Enrollment Team, 10-10EZ, July 2023]


  
## Warm-up Questions  - 3 minutes

Let’s start with a couple warm-up questions.

- How long have you been enrolled in and using health care benefits from the VA?  I’ve been doing it for about 5 years.
- How often do you visit VA.gov online and do you sign in every time you visit? I visit it at least once or twice a week. I refill prescriptions and check appointments. Yes, I do sign in through HealtheVet.
  

## First Topic: [Application Process] - 10 minutes

- Can you explain to me in your own words the process when you applied for health care benefits? Basically, I went to my local VA, and they gave me information and gave them my DD-214 and they gave me an ID card. That is when I was advised of the VA website. I did the paper form, and if I need to get reimbursed for travel, I have to do that online. It is more technically advanced now.
- [If they don't specify] Did you apply online, in-person or via paper application by yourself? I did it by myself.
- What resources did you use to understand what health care benefits you might qualify for during this process? Basically, word of mouth from other Veterans who are friends and family. I have a lot of friends that can get me help to where to begin.
Since enrolling you have started using the website more and more. Yes, once you start getting used to a primary provider they change. Some of them there may be a language barrier. I felt a lot of the providers have been very helpful and what Is out there for you.
- How would you describe the process that happened after you completed your application, such as things you had to do, additional information you had to provide, communications from the VA, your first appointment, etc.? My MOS was communications in the military and in the civilian world. Most of the time I message through the online portal to send my messages to certain departments to meet my needs.
Do you remember getting any communications after you filled out the application? They are fast when it comes to responding to my messages because I can be at work at, they will come through my email. When they mail you a lot of stuff it may get tossed aside. For me I preferred the email method. 

You don’t remember getting any communications? I remember getting reminders in the mail about appointments which are helpful if you need to take off work, so you don’t have to take off work.
- Now that you have been using your benefits, I would like you to think back and recall if there is anything that would have been helpful for you to know during your application process that you have learned after you enrolled? As far as filing the claim I was able to find out more about the claim filing process once I got to the VA website. I was able to file a claim and check for updates. Another thing is checking for copays. That is pretty helpful as well.
- How have you - if at all - been notified since you enrolled that you had to provide updated information?
I am always proactive when it comes to things like that. I just recently moved so I had to contact them to let them know that I had moved so I can get my medications to my correct address along with my cell phone information. Yeah, after covid I ran into health issues so I want to make sure I stay up on my medication.

### Things to watch for:
- [What terminology does the Veteran use as they talk about their experience?]
- [How does the Veteran portray the overall process - easy, difficult, uneventful?]
- [How does the Veteran describe the process of figuring out what they are eligible for - are they frustrated or do they find it easy?]
- [What does the Veteran call out about the process after the initial application and around managing their benefits?]
- [What pain points or areas of confusion are revealed?]


## Second Topic: [Priority Group - Awareness] - 5 minutes
- Can you tell me more about what Priority Group you are in for your health care benefits now?
I am not service connected. I applied for a few things, but I was turned down. It was back in the 80s when I served so you know that you have to dot your I’s and cross your t’s. If was just the matter of going through the process. I have been turned down but there is always an appeal process. If I am not mistaken, I think I am 2. 
Do you remember where you learned about it? I don’t know where that is based on. I am assuming it is 2 as far as I know.
[If aware of Priority Groups]
- Can you please describe how this was communicated to you and how you understood the impact to you and your benefits?
- Before you completed enrollment, how were you aware of Priority Groups or copays as part of the health care benefits package? No, I was not.
- [if yes] Can you tell me more about what you knew before you applied and how you learned that information?
- Since you have been using your benefits, what have you learned about Priority Groups and the impact it has on you and health care benefits that you wish you knew during the application?

[If NOT aware of Priority Groups, ask question and skip to fourth topic]
- What do you think Priority Groups are? There is no right or wrong answer here, just explain your understanding of what you think it could be and how that is important to health care benefits. 



### Things to watch for:
- [Do Veterans' confidently know their Priority Group and what that means to them and their benefits?]
- [What is the current process and experience around Priority Groups?]
- [What are the knowledge gaps around Priority Groups and health care costs?]
- [What things would Veterans like to see or like to change in regards to Priority Groups?]

## Third Topic: [Priority Group - Future State] - 5 minutes
- Where are some places that you would like to be able to view your Priority Group number? Why? I think your profile would be a good place to find out what priority group you are in and what that means for you and your benefits. That way you will know. Say dental, if you are not service connected and it says you have to be priority 1 for you to receive it you wouldn’t waste your time trying if you don’t qualify. What you can and cannot apply for. Time is important and you don’t want to waste time if you wouldn’t receive it.
- How would this be a benefit to you?
- What type of information is important to you to have access to about your Priority Group and your health care benefits?
- Is there anything you find confusing about how your Priority Group impacts you today that you wish the VA would provide more clarity on? No, like I said I like to go on there and research stuff. I find the VA website to be a user-friendly site.


### Things to watch for:
- [Do Veterans call out VA.gov as where they would expect to find this information? Do they list VA Profile?]
- [Do Veterans mention other channels to find and manage this information - Profile, MHV, mobile, etc?]
- [What information do Veterans want to know about their Priority Group?]

## Fourth Topic: [Updates post enrollment] - 5 minutes
- Changing directions a bit now, since you enrolled, have you had to make any updates to your information since your initial application? Yeah, I had my mom listed as my beneficiary, but she passed so I had to change that. I also recently moved so I had to update that as well. That is pretty much it.  I did I on my own.
- If yes:
   - Can you please tell me more about that. What did you have to update and how was that experience for you?
   - How were you notified or how did you find out you needed to supply that updated information? I did it on my own.
   - Is there anything about that experience that you wish you could change? It is always best to keep that up to date because you never know what is going to happen and you do not want to put someone out in case something happens.
   - Did you have to make updates for other benefits too or just health care? Just my healthcare benefits.


## [Financial Disclosure] - 5 minutes
- How would you see a change in income impacting your health care benefits? Well like I said often times I have had some transportation issues where they had to pick me up. You have to fill out a GAINES Report to show what type of income you make and the number of  people living in your house. It takes in the effect of medical expenses and  student loans to see if you have to do the copay. That is something I try to keep up with.
Do you think income could impact you? Yes. 
- How would you want to be notified to provide your updated financial information? I would prefer the email method.


## [Dependents] - 5 minutes
- Have you ever had a need to make changes to your dependents for VA benefits? If so, can you tell me more about that experience. 
- Ideally if you had to make changes to your dependents, can you explain to me how you would go about doing that? Some of the information may not be up to date. Trying to keep my daughter’s address updated and press them for their social security numbers to make it less of a problem in case something was to happen. You have to find someone who will have your best needs in mind.
Do you recall where you went to do that? I went to VA.gov because I was engaged but I had to take her off. 


### Things to watch for:
- [What is the current process and pain points when making updates to post enrollment?]
- [What type of information is mentioned as what has been or they could see being updated?]



## Fifth Topic: [EZR Tasks - SCENARIO] - 10 minutes

- I would like to ask if you are comfortable sharing your screen and walking through a task on VA.gov? Yes.
- Please be sure to close any personal information, like email, Facebook, etc., before you share your screen.

- For this scenario, you received a communication to update your annual income to maintain your copay and travel reimbursement costs as part of your health care benefits. I would like to ask you to show me where and how you would expect to accomplish this online. 

- [Share link to VA.gov in Zoom chat for VA.gov]


[Notification and process]
- How would you like to receive this communication that you need to provide updated financial information? Correct email.
- What would you want to know in this communication about how and why you need to update your financial information? Just say for instance if it could tell me to update my information if it would be harmful to them providing my healthcare services. Just let me know what could happen if I do not update that. Just let me know why it is important.

[Where to find]
- Now, from the VA.gov home page, can you walk me through where you would expect to go to update your annual income? On the main screen where they have these tabs if you could add a tab that says Update your finances. 
- Please remember to talk aloud about your thought process as you go.
- Can you explain to me why you went [here] to update your financial information? If you see something instead of having to search for it, especially if you could lose your benefits, there is a need for it to be upfront.
What would you want it to be called? Personal income or something of that nature. One thing I would add is I always MHV I find all the other logins to be very consuming because you have to meet so many requirements to create a password. I found MHV more user friendly in terms of logging in. I know in the military a lot of things may be on a need-to-know information. There may be a reason why you may need to create a harder password so people can’t just hack you.
Would you expect that to be anywhere else besides the first page when you log in? I guess you can have it under the personal information.
- Talk to me about where you would expect to find the ability to complete this task and why.
-[Possible prompt to remind them that this task is not available today, but want to know where you would expect to find it if it was made available]

[**IF** they state the would go to the VA Profile to update this information]
- Are you comfortable logging in to your own VA profile account? 
- [If no] Or would you rather have me share my screen and a test account with you and we can talk through the rest of this together?

[Possible prompts]
- What would you be looking for when you first login to update this information? Something in the sidebar or a notification?
- Would you think these fits with any of the existing options or would you expect this to be something new?
- What would you expect this new section to be called?



  

[Backup =  which test account to login to if there are concerns or issues with screen sharing after they state they would update this in Profile?]

- Test user 80


### Things to watch for:
- [Where does the Veteran initially think to go to access this information? Do they validate hypothesis and go to their profile, or do they look in other places to update this information?]
- [How does the Veteran expect to find this information from the home page, or do they mention notifications or other paths as preferred ways to make these updates?]
- [How does the Veteran want to be communicated to and aware of what they need to do in regard to annual income updates?]

## Post-Task Interview - 2 minutes

- Is there anything else you would like to add about what we talked about today? No, I mean I found this to be very helpful because I can send a message when I have an appointment and they set up the transportation for me. 
- Any questions for me? No it was a good experience.
