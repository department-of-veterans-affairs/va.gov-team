# Conversation Guide for health care application generative research study around Priority Groups and Financial Disclosure Updates [Health Enrollment Team, 10-10EZ, July 2023]


  
## Warm-up Questions  - 3 minutes

Let’s start with a couple warm-up questions.

- How long have you been enrolled in and using health care benefits from the VA? Since 2018, so five years now.
- How often do you visit VA.gov online and do you sign in every time you visit? Yes, I have to sign in every time. At least once a month
  

## First Topic: [Application Process] - 10 minutes

- Can you explain to me in your own words the process when you applied for health care benefits? I can’t remember if I went on Ebenefits or VA.gov. It took a while to find it, but you have to file a claim put that in and then you are requesting the health benefits. I had a health bus come to my area and I had to go there to do the health things.
- [If they don't specify] Did you apply online, in-person or via paper application by yourself? When I was getting out of the Army, they helped me get into the VA I was moving to. When I got here, I had to do the disability claims, so it was a little different, so I had to do some online. They helped me get enrolled here so I was already set up with a team.
- What resources did you use to understand what health care benefits you might qualify for during this process? So, there are a lot of emails from the VA website that get sent out. Recently they talked about the PACT Act, so I heard a lot of things from there. Usually, I just ask my doctor when I am at an appointment.
- How would you describe the process that happened after you completed your application, such as things you had to do, additional information you had to provide, communications from the VA, your first appointment, etc.? I cant remember back in 2018, but I do remember set up the initial appointment to transfer me to that VA. They do a picture and get a VA ID that gets mailed. You get to pick your team you want to be on. I think they also talked about things that were going on at my VA. I am trying to think after that. I had my appointments. Now there is an app that you can talk to them on. All communications before the app I had to call.
- Now that you have been using your benefits, I would like you to think back and recall if there is anything that would have been helpful for you to know during your application process that you have learned after you enrolled? I wish they would have told me that I have some medical issues and it took a little time to get everything going, and I wasn’t told what all I could get to help with my medical issues. If there was a big list you could get would have been really nice.
- How have you - if at all - been notified since you enrolled that you had to provide updated information?
The ways I get notified is app sometimes, email, and paper stuff in mail.

### Things to watch for:
- [What terminology does the Veteran use as they talk about their experience?]
- [How does the Veteran portray the overall process - easy, difficult, uneventful?]
- [How does the Veteran describe the process of figuring out what they are eligible for - are they frustrated or do they find it easy?]
- [What does the Veteran call out about the process after the initial application and around managing their benefits?]
- [What pain points or areas of confusion are revealed?]


## Second Topic: [Priority Group - Awareness] - 5 minutes
- Can you tell me more about what Priority Group you are in for your health care benefits now?
I am trying to think of what the priority groups are.
[If aware of Priority Groups]
- Can you please describe how this was communicated to you and how you understood the impact to you and your benefits?
- Before you completed enrollment, how were you aware of Priority Groups or copays as part of the health care benefits package?
- [if yes] Can you tell me more about what you knew before you applied and how you learned that information?
- Since you have been using your benefits, what have you learned about Priority Groups and the impact it has on you and health care benefits that you wish you knew during the application?

[If NOT aware of Priority Groups, ask question and skip to fourth topic]
- What do you think Priority Groups are? There is no right or wrong answer here, just explain your understanding of what you think it could be and how that is important to health care benefits. 
I would think it is based off of disability, but I wouldn’t even know where to find that. I am assuming the more disabled you are the more priority you have. They never talk about that unless it is something at the beginning.



### Things to watch for:
- [Do Veterans' confidently know their Priority Group and what that means to them and their benefits?]
- [What is the current process and experience around Priority Groups?]
- [What are the knowledge gaps around Priority Groups and health care costs?]
- [What things would Veterans like to see or like to change in regards to Priority Groups?]

## Third Topic: [Priority Group - Future State] - 5 minutes
- Where are some places that you would like to be able to view your Priority Group number? Why? I would say on the VA app. Does that have to do whether you are service connected or have the copay thing? If it was related to the copay, it wouldn’t matter how much you would pay in VA vs outside source. For me I use everything through the VA. I don’t know what priority group I am in, but I do not pay for anything.
- How would this be a benefit to you?
- What type of information is important to you to have access to about your Priority Group and your health care benefits?
- Is there anything you find confusing about how your Priority Group impacts you today that you wish the VA would provide more clarity on?


### Things to watch for:
- [Do Veterans call out VA.gov as where they would expect to find this information? Do they list VA Profile?]
- [Do Veterans mention other channels to find and manage this information - Profile, MHV, mobile, etc?]
- [What information do Veterans want to know about their Priority Group?]

## Fourth Topic: [Updates post enrollment] - 5 minutes
- Changing directions a bit now, since you enrolled, have you had to make any updates to your information since your initial application? Yes, I got married in 2019 so I had to update my last name. I don’t think. Maybe I had to do something for education. I remember changing my personal email and address.
- If yes:
   - Can you please tell me more about that. What did you have to update and how was that experience for you? I think it was on the website I remember talking to someone telling me to email my marriage certificate somewhere. I remember having to submit it and it is taking a while, then I had to add my husband and daughter to my disability. 
   - How were you notified or how did you find out you needed to supply that updated information? Not for that. That was all I had to research to find out what I needed to do. I wasn’t contacted for that. If anything, I may have gotten an email about checking my information.
   - Is there anything about that experience that you wish you could change? Maybe the time it took because it took a couple weeks for my name to change. 
   - Did you have to make updates for other benefits too or just health care?
I tried to do my TSP, and they did not like the scan of my marriage certificate which 5 years later it still sits as my maiden name.

## [Financial Disclosure] - 5 minutes
- How would you see a change in income impacting your health care benefits? I think the more income I would make the easier I could get in to get my care because I would be able to afford it outside of the VA. It would help also when I get older, and my body starts shutting down I can go down to part-time. It wouldn’t go towards VA services so I would have to go to outside services. It seems like they don’t have enough services within the VA that they would have to send us out to the community. 

- How would you want to be notified to provide your updated financial information?
I know they send out emails about the disability charts I just need to increase my own benefits. There are more services elsewhere that are not offered here. 

## [Dependents] - 5 minutes
- Have you ever had a need to make changes to your dependents for VA benefits? If so, can you tell me more about that experience. It wasn’t that difficult. I think I had to submit her birth certificate. I don’t think there were any issues with anything there. It reflected within 3 weeks, and they gave me back pay for that. There is not much I have to add for her because she is not covered.
- Ideally if you had to make changes to your dependents, can you explain to me how you would go about doing that? Just the time we have to wait until they are added. It was a couple weeks, and he still wasn’t added, and I called and ask what was going on and then he was added.


### Things to watch for:
- [What is the current process and pain points when making updates to post enrollment?]
- [What type of information is mentioned as what has been or they could see being updated?]



## Fifth Topic: [EZR Tasks - SCENARIO] - 10 minutes

- I would like to ask if you are comfortable sharing your screen and walking through a task on VA.gov? Sure.
- Please be sure to close any personal information, like email, Facebook, etc., before you share your screen.

- For this scenario, you received a communication to update your annual income to maintain your copay and travel reimbursement costs as part of your health care benefits. I would like to ask you to show me where and how you would expect to accomplish this online. 

- [Share link to VA.gov in Zoom chat for VA.gov]


[Notification and process]
- How would you like to receive this communication that you need to provide updated financial information? Definitely I think an email and something on the actual app because you get spammed with so many emails that may get deleted. If it says something about Urgent you need to do this, then I would do that. It would be nice to see it on the app as a message. A direct message would be the best way to see it. 
- What would you want to know in this communication about how and why you need to update your financial information? I want to know why they want me to update it and how to do so would be nice to have instructions. It would be nice to have it right on my phone.

[Where to find]
- Now, from the VA.gov home page, can you walk me through where you would expect to go to update your annual income? First thing is I would look at my own profile under my health. 
- Please remember to talk aloud about your thought process as you go.
- Can you explain to me why you went [here] to update your financial information? Just looking I am trying to see personal information, so I clicked that to see if there was anything to lead me there. I would try personal information, pay or receive funds. Yeah, I think so. Anywhere under your personal information is where I think it should be to update your pay. I would also do it where you would update your direct deposit. 
Can you navigate to the My VA itself. I think it would be good to have because it is an overall summary of everything you have. This would be a good place to have that under update your financial information. 
Can you go to your profile? Here where would you think? Bank information that is where I would go for that. I would assume that would go through your regular pay. Travel pays direct deposit, or if it was under your normal direct deposit you need to note that within the system. If there was a breakdown of your disability income, travel pay, and if you could select a different bank account that would be good in my mind. That would make it nice. You don’t want it to be too difficult to find.
You mentioned it would be good under your profile, but you clicked on my health is that because you are used to going there? Yes, because that is where I typically go. Most of the time I get links I get taken there and I have to do everything there. 
- Talk to me about where you would expect to find the ability to complete this task and why.
-[Possible prompt to remind them that this task is not available today, but want to know where you would expect to find it if it was made available]

[**IF** they state the would go to the VA Profile to update this information]
- Are you comfortable logging in to your own VA profile account? 
- [If no] Or would you rather have me share my screen and a test account with you and we can talk through the rest of this together?

[Possible prompts]
- What would you be looking for when you first login to update this information? Something in the sidebar or a notification?
- Would you think this fits with any of the existing options or would you expect this to be something new?
- What would you expect this new section to be called?



  

[Backup =  which test account to login to if there are concerns or issues with screen sharing after they state they would update this in Profile?]

- Test user 80


### Things to watch for:
- [Where does the Veteran initially think to go to access this information? Do they validate hypothesis and go to their profile or do they look in other places to update this information?]
- [How does the Veteran expect to find this information from the home page or do they mention notifications or other paths as preferred ways to make these updates?]
- [How does the Veteran want to be communicated to and aware of what they need to do in regards to annual income updates?]

## Post-Task Interview - 2 minutes

- Is there anything else you would like to add about what we talked about today? No, the only comment I can make is it would be nice not to have to sign into the site so many times when switching between the VA sites. 
- Any questions for me? No, I don’t. It is clear you are trying to improve the site for Veteran which is very cool.
