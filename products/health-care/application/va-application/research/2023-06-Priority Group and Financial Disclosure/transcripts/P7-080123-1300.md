# Conversation Guide for health care application generative research study around Priority Groups and Financial Disclosure Updates [Health Enrollment Team, 10-10EZ, July 2023]


  
## Warm-up Questions  - 3 minutes

Let’s start with a couple warm-up questions.

- How long have you been enrolled in and using health care benefits from the VA? Maybe a year. 
- How often do you visit VA.gov online and do you sign in every time you visit? Yeah, I don’t go in that often unless I have a need to. I am community care so my appointments don’t show up in the app, I will they did. I have an appeal in process for my disability, so I go on every couple month to log in a check that. I can’t remember if it signs in on its own or not.
  

## First Topic: [Application Process] - 10 minutes

- Can you explain to me in your own words the process when you applied for health care benefits? They gave me my VA disability and my healthcare came with it. I think I filled out the application online and it was pretty painless from what I remember. I went to Nashville to get evaluated. They called me on the phone and signed me up for it.
- [If they don't specify] Did you apply online, in-person or via paper application by yourself? I went online to set up my account, they called me on the phone first to tell me I needed to go online to set up my account.
- What resources did you use to understand what health care benefits you might qualify for during this process? I would qualify for medical, and I don’t remember the conversation I had with the young man because I was driving at the time. From what I understand my medical coverage does not include dental because my rating was not high enough. The man explained a lot. When I got home, I went online and created my account and went through the website to find out. I also ask questions when I go to my community care appointments. They also said my rating does not cover reimbursement on travel.
- How would you describe the process that happened after you completed your application, such as things you had to do, additional information you had to provide, communications from the VA, your first appointment, etc.? I get letters from them anytime I got through anything. The app is helpful to keep things straight back then and now I use I to keep track of my rating. They send me correspondence when I do anything. I did it through the website and it asked me who my normal doctor was but he was not on the list for my address. 
- Now that you have been using your benefits, I would like you to think back and recall if there is anything that would have been helpful for you to know during your application process that you have learned after you enrolled? Well there really wasn’t a good explanation between the community care and the VA care. When I go to an appointment they have to send that to VA and then they go through another department and then they contact me. So when something pops up that doesn’t seem right I have to call the department they tell me to call the nurse, then they tell me I have to call my doctor. I  finally had to get in touch with them to let them know what was going on. None of that is in the app. Trying to keep everyone on the same page is hard. I am having to contact my doctor, the VA nurses, and then the scheduling people. That is the only thing I can really think of. When I originally went to the VA my stuff got all messed up and had to final an appeal. With someone in the VA being the middle person between the primary provider and the scheduler is a lot to handle.  I don’t know how they are doing it. I would think if the physician side had some kind of device it would pop up in Optima. I had a lot of referrals to handle at the beginning to try to balance out. 
- How have you - if at all - been notified since you enrolled that you had to provide updated information?
I don’t recall getting notifications for it.

### Things to watch for:
- [What terminology does the Veteran use as they talk about their experience?]
- [How does the Veteran portray the overall process - easy, difficult, uneventful?]
- [How does the Veteran describe the process of figuring out what they are eligible for - are they frustrated or do they find it easy?]
- [What does the Veteran call out about the process after the initial application and around managing their benefits?]
- [What pain points or areas of confusion are revealed?]


## Second Topic: [Priority Group - Awareness] - 5 minutes
- Can you tell me more about what Priority Group you are in for your health care benefits now?
You mean whats my rating? 
It is related to ratings, are you familiar with priority groups? No.
[If aware of Priority Groups]
- Can you please describe how this was communicated to you and how you understood the impact to you and your benefits?
- Before you completed enrollment, how were you aware of Priority Groups or copays as part of the health care benefits package?
- [if yes] Can you tell me more about what you knew before you applied and how you learned that information?
- Since you have been using your benefits, what have you learned about Priority Groups and the impact it has on you and health care benefits that you wish you knew during the application?

[If NOT aware of Priority Groups, ask question and skip to fourth topic]
- What do you think Priority Groups are? There is no right or wrong answer here, just explain your understanding of what you think it could be and how that is important to health care benefits. 
It has to do with your disability and whether you are a priority over another Veteran. If you are at 100% you better a higher priority over someone who is lower. 

How would it affect your benefits? If it is at the VA for appointments, they may move your appointments. If they run out of money, they may just shut off all the medical care for everyone besides the individuals who are 100%.




### Things to watch for:
- [Do Veterans' confidently know their Priority Group and what that means to them and their benefits?]
- [What is the current process and experience around Priority Groups?]
- [What are the knowledge gaps around Priority Groups and health care costs?]
- [What things would Veterans like to see or like to change in regards to Priority Groups?]

## Third Topic: [Priority Group - Future State] - 5 minutes
- Where are some places that you would like to be able to view your Priority Group number? Why?
- How would this be a benefit to you?
- What type of information is important to you to have access to about your Priority Group and your health care benefits?
- Is there anything you find confusing about how your Priority Group impacts you today that you wish the VA would provide more clarity on?


### Things to watch for:
- [Do Veterans call out VA.gov as where they would expect to find this information? Do they list VA Profile?]
- [Do Veterans mention other channels to find and manage this information - Profile, MHV, mobile, etc?]
- [What information do Veterans want to know about their Priority Group?]

## Fourth Topic: [Updates post enrollment] - 5 minutes
- Changing directions, a bit now, since you enrolled, have you had to make any updates to your information since your initial application? I don’t recall updating my information.
- If yes:
   - Can you please tell me more about that. What did you have to update and how was that experience for you?
   - How were you notified or how did you find out you needed to supply that updated information?
   - Is there anything about that experience that you wish you could change?
   - Did you have to make updates for other benefits too or just health care?


## [Financial Disclosure] - 5 minutes
- How would you see a change in income impacting your health care benefits? I don’t know I don’t think it would. Unless I won the lottery or something like that. I don’t think my income is sufficient enough to impact anything.
- How would you want to be notified to provide your updated financial information?
Through an app, phone call, or letter it doesn’t matter. It is the 21st century, the app would be preferred as long as it is all sync’d up. 

## [Dependents] - 5 minutes
- Have you ever had a need to make changes to your dependents for VA benefits? If so, can you tell me more about that experience.  No.
- Ideally if you had to make changes to your dependents, can you explain to me how you would go about doing that? I would imagine that would be through the website.
Do you know what part of the website you would go to? Somewhere connected to my profile probably. 


### Things to watch for:
- [What is the current process and pain points when making updates to post enrollment?]
- [What type of information is mentioned as what has been or they could see being updated?]



## Fifth Topic: [EZR Tasks - SCENARIO] - 10 minutes

- I would like to ask if you are comfortable sharing your screen and walking through a task on VA.gov?  Okay how do I share my screen? Okay. 
- Please be sure to close any personal information, like email, Facebook, etc., before you share your screen.

- For this scenario, you received a communication to update your annual income to maintain your copay and travel reimbursement costs as part of your health care benefits. I would like to ask you to show me where and how you would expect to accomplish this online. 

- [Share link to VA.gov in Zoom chat for VA.gov]


[Notification and process]
- How would you like to receive this communication that you need to provide updated financial information? It would be fine with an email, text, or a notification through the app that would be preferrable. 
- What would you want to know in this communication about how and why you need to update your financial information? I wouldn’t need to know anything if they needed to know that is fine.

[Where to find]
- Now, from the VA.gov home page, can you walk me through where you would expect to go to update your annual income? Do you want me to sign in? I will expect to if I need to update my financial information.  
I see that you are navigating to your profile, is that where you would think it would be? Yes, I would expect it to be there. 
- Please remember to talk aloud about your thought process as you go.
- Can you explain to me why you went [here] to update your financial information? Because this is my personal information. I would go to direct deposit. If all else fails, I would go to search.
If it were not under direct deposit information, where would you expect it to be? I would think direct deposit information to be under my financial information tab. I don’t know what other information you would need. You would think the VA would tie directly into the IRS. That would probably be the easiest way to do it to connect our IRS and VA information together. 
You would expect there to be a section that is called personal finance information? Something similar to that. It has payment history down here. I would expect that information to fall under personal finance information. 
- Talk to me about where you would expect to find the ability to complete this task and why.
-[Possible prompt to remind them that this task is not available today, but want to know where you would expect to find it if it was made available]

[**IF** they state the would go to the VA Profile to update this information]
- Are you comfortable logging in to your own VA profile account? 
- [If no] Or would you rather have me share my screen and a test account with you and we can talk through the rest of this together?

[Possible prompts]
- What would you be looking for when you first login to update this information? Something in the sidebar or a notification?
- Would you think this fits with any of the existing options or would you expect this to be something new?
- What would you expect this new section to be called?




### Things to watch for:
- [Where does the Veteran initially think to go to access this information? Do they validate hypothesis and go to their profile or do they look in other places to update this information?]
- [How does the Veteran expect to find this information from the home page or do they mention notifications or other paths as preferred ways to make these updates?]
- [How does the Veteran want to be communicated to and aware of what they need to do in regards to annual income updates?]

## Post-Task Interview - 2 minutes

- Is there anything else you would like to add about what we talked about today? Not that I can think of.
- Any questions for me? Oh no. I know the VA and the evaluation is separate. The evaluation people had my records since they were they looking at it while they were looking at me. If they had such a sort of digital download that you could have access to your records immediately. This way when you go into community care, and they ask for the medical records they will be able to view them as well. That is the only additional thing I could think of on the top of my head.
