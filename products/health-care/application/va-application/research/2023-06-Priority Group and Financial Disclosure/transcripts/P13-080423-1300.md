# Conversation Guide for health care application generative research study around Priority Groups and Financial Disclosure Updates [Health Enrollment Team, 10-10EZ, July 2023]

  
## Warm-up Questions  - 3 minutes

Let’s start with a couple warm-up questions.

- How long have you been enrolled in and using health care benefits from the VA? I started receiving healthcare benefits in September of last year.
- How often do you visit VA.gov online and do you sign in every time you visit? I probably visit once or twice a month and sign in 60% of the time. It is annoying to have to do the two-step verification everything.
  

## First Topic: [Application Process] - 10 minutes

- Can you explain to me in your own words the process when you applied for health care benefits? The process with the VA was fine but the process to get my DD-214 from the military took about a month. Apart from that and having to wait on the phone for an hour and a half every time I called. 
- [If they don't specify] Did you apply online, in-person or via paper application by yourself? On the phone a lot because I had a lot of questions about what I needed, what the benefits were, and just how long it would take. I did the application online.
- What resources did you use to understand what health care benefits you might qualify for during this process? I used the VA website, reps on the phone, the TAP class (it is a requirement you have to take you have to do when you are leaving the military) that was very helpful. 
- How would you describe the process that happened after you completed your application, such as things you had to do, additional information you had to provide, communications from the VA, your first appointment, etc.? It has been very smooth. The doctor, I picked community care because it is closer to me rather than the VA clinics on the island. I am not sure my range of doctors are limited due to my healthcare insurance. I was also able to choose the doctor at the office closest to me.
- Now that you have been using your benefits, I would like you to think back and recall if there is anything that would have been helpful for you to know during your application process that you have learned after you enrolled? I did not even know community care was an option. I thought I would have to drive 30 minutes anytime I wanted to see my provider. I mean apart from having to call the VA to call and remember which number to press to get to the office I wanted to go, it is a smooth process. It just may take a while to talk to someone on the phone. 
- How have you - if at all - been notified since you enrolled that you had to provide updated information?
They seem to ask every time I call to confirm my address. That is a lot of confirming my address, which is great to make sure they have my correct address, but that is a lot. 

### Things to watch for:
- [What terminology does the Veteran use as they talk about their experience?]
- [How does the Veteran portray the overall process - easy, difficult, uneventful?]
- [How does the Veteran describe the process of figuring out what they are eligible for - are they frustrated or do they find it easy?]
- [What does the Veteran call out about the process after the initial application and around managing their benefits?]
- [What pain points or areas of confusion are revealed?]


## Second Topic: [Priority Group - Awareness] - 5 minutes
- Can you tell me more about what Priority Group you are in for your health care benefits now?
I started off as Priority Group 3 or 4 I was paying for medication, and then I got my disability rating and now I am Group 1, I think.
[If aware of Priority Groups]
- Can you please describe how this was communicated to you and how you understood the impact to you and your benefits? The first time I received healthcare she told me on the phone, I was very thankful that was even possible. Then it came in a physical letter in the mail later. There may have been an email, but it seems like that everything comes in the mail. 
- Before you completed enrollment, how were you aware of Priority Groups or copays as part of the health care benefits package?
- [if yes] Can you tell me more about what you knew before you applied and how you learned that information?
- Since you have been using your benefits, what have you learned about Priority Groups and the impact it has on you and health care benefits that you wish you knew during the application? I wasn’t really aware of this, I only learned that the VA would help all Veterans.

[If NOT aware of Priority Groups, ask question and skip to fourth topic]
- What do you think Priority Groups are? There is no right or wrong answer here, just explain your understanding of what you think it could be and how that is important to health care benefits. 
There are some ways how much you would pay for medication and healthcare. It is also how quickly you will be seen if you need to see a doctor.



### Things to watch for:
- [Do Veterans' confidently know their Priority Group and what that means to them and their benefits?]
- [What is the current process and experience around Priority Groups?]
- [What are the knowledge gaps around Priority Groups and health care costs?]
- [What things would Veterans like to see or like to change in regards to Priority Groups?]

## Third Topic: [Priority Group - Future State] - 5 minutes
- Where are some places that you would like to be able to view your Priority Group number? Why? When I sign into the VA it would be nice to see right on the home page what priority group I am in and a timeframe. The healthcare part of the website. If I am looking at the education part, the healthcare is not up front in my mind.
- How would this be a benefit to you? Just to prepare for the future.
- What type of information is important to you to have access to about your Priority Group and your health care benefits? What does it mean, how many times can I go to Urgent Care, a reminder that there is a Nurse’s Advice line and the number, that would be nice. 
- Is there anything you find confusing about how your Priority Group impacts you today that you wish the VA would provide more clarity on? It is pretty clear once it is broken down.


### Things to watch for:
- [Do Veterans call out VA.gov as where they would expect to find this information? Do they list VA Profile?]
- [Do Veterans mention other channels to find and manage this information - Profile, MHV, mobile, etc?]
- [What information do Veterans want to know about their Priority Group?]

## Fourth Topic: [Updates post enrollment] - 5 minutes
- Changing directions a bit now, since you enrolled, have you had to make any updates to your information since your initial application? No, I have not moved I don’t know what else would need to be updated.
- If yes:
   - Can you please tell me more about that. What did you have to update and how was that experience for you?
   - How were you notified or how did you find out you needed to supply that updated information?
   - Is there anything about that experience that you wish you could change?
   - Did you have to make updates for other benefits too or just health care?


## [Financial Disclosure] - 5 minutes
- How would you see a change in income impacting your health care benefits?
- How would you want to be notified to provide your updated financial information?


## [Dependents] - 5 minutes
- Have you ever had a need to make changes to your dependents for VA benefits? If so, can you tell me more about that experience. 
- Ideally if you had to make changes to your dependents, can you explain to me how you would go about doing that?


### Things to watch for:
- [What is the current process and pain points when making updates to post enrollment?]
- [What type of information is mentioned as what has been or they could see being updated?]



## Fifth Topic: [EZR Tasks - SCENARIO] - 10 minutes

- I would like to ask if you are comfortable sharing your screen and walking through a task on VA.gov? Sure.
- Please be sure to close any personal information, like email, Facebook, etc., before you share your screen.

- For this scenario, you received a communication to update your annual income to maintain your copay and travel reimbursement costs as part of your health care benefits. I would like to ask you to show me where and how you would expect to accomplish this online. 

- [Share link to VA.gov in Zoom chat for VA.gov]


[Notification and process]
- How would you like to receive this communication that you need to provide updated financial information? Email and secondary would be a letter in the mail.
- What would you want to know in this communication about how and why you need to update your financial information? I want to know accurate information how to access this on the website in an updated way because I have received emails where the links are expired which don’t help me. Where on the website I need to do, and what documents I need so I do not have to stop and look for whatever they need. 
You like to use the VA site on your mobile? I prefer desktop but I do not have internet at home so most of the time I use the mobile.

[Where to find]
- Now, from the VA.gov home page, can you walk me through where you would expect to go to update your annual income? I really have no idea, maybe go to my account. I am looking where this may be so I am thinking this may be in my account. I would think it would be in my account which would be here in my profile. Either that of VA benefits. Also, in this list in the dropdown box. Either in my benefits and healthcare or my profile. It is not going to be related to anything specific.
If it was here, where do you think it would be? It would under My VA as update your financial information. Like a banner or a notification because none of those things listed pertain to that. It would make sense to be under Personal information. 
What would you expect this section to be called? How to update your financial information.
- Please remember to talk aloud about your thought process as you go.
- Can you explain to me why you went [here] to update your financial information?
- Talk to me about where you would expect to find the ability to complete this task and why.
-[Possible prompt to remind them that this task is not available today, but want to know where you would expect to find it if it was made available]

[**IF** they state the would go to the VA Profile to update this information]
- Are you comfortable logging in to your own VA profile account? 
- [If no] Or would you rather have me share my screen and a test account with you and we can talk through the rest of this together?

[Possible prompts]
- What would you be looking for when you first login to update this information? Something in the sidebar or a notification?
- Would you think this fits with any of the existing options or would you expect this to be something new?
- What would you expect this new section to be called?



  

[Backup =  which test account to login to if there are concerns or issues with screen sharing after they state they would update this in Profile?]

- Test user 80


### Things to watch for:
- [Where does the Veteran initially think to go to access this information? Do they validate hypothesis and go to their profile or do they look in other places to update this information?]
- [How does the Veteran expect to find this information from the home page or do they mention notifications or other paths as preferred ways to make these updates?]
- [How does the Veteran want to be communicated to and aware of what they need to do in regards to annual income updates?]

## Post-Task Interview - 2 minutes

- Is there anything else you would like to add about what we talked about today?  No, the main things are everyone at the VA has been nice and patient, 2 hours waiting for a phone call is annoying, and the two-step authentication is really annoying.
Have you ever had a hard time with the mobile app? I have had issues with submitting my DD-214 because no one could assist me with uploading my documentation for my healthcare benefits. It is hard to figure out how to upload documents in general whether the app or the desktop. For basic use it is fine but finding out details or submitting documents is a stripped-down version. The app is even more you have a benefit it helps you with this per month and that is it. Very stripped-down version.
- Any questions for me? No.
