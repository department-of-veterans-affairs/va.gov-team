Conversation Guide for health care application generative research study around Priority Groups and Financial Disclosure Updates [Health Enrollment Team, 10-10EZ, July 2023]


Start recording.

I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 
- Yes.
  
Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners, if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?
- Yeah.
  
### Warm-up Questions - 3 minutes
Let’s start with a couple warm-up questions.

How long have you been enrolled in and using health care benefits from the VA? 
- I think it has been going on a year in August.

How often do you visit VA.gov online and do you sign in every time you visit? 
- In a month I go maybe like 3-8 times.  I usually log in every time.
  
### First Topic: [Application Process] - 10 minutes

Can you explain to me in your own words the process when you applied for health care benefits? 
- Good question. I think it was pretty straightforward if I recall correctly. It was clear where to apply for benefits. There is one page that has all the VA benefits. That was straightforward. When you apply for it, you just have to answer a series of questions about service history. I didn’t think it was hard. I could do it because I am tech savvy. I found it easy.
  
[If they don't specify] Did you apply online, in-person or via paper application by yourself? 
- It was online.
  
What resources did you use to understand what health care benefits you might qualify for during this process? 
- I was really concerned about how I would be eligible because I separated a long time ago in 07 from active duty, but I went into the reserves until 2013. I was just really digging into if I was eligible. There were other pages about VA health that I looked into. When it came to applying that was it.

How would you describe the process that happened after you completed your application, such as things you had to do, additional information you had to provide, communications from the VA, your first appointment, etc.? 
- After I hit submit I think I saw a confirmation and that it would be submitted. I think what happened was they sent me a letter informing a letter outlining what was next. I didn’t need to submit additional information. I remember seeing a letter and what facility I was assigned. It was all new to me. It was straightforward.
  
Now that you have been using your benefits, I would like you to think back and recall if there is anything that would have been helpful for you to know during your application process that you have learned after you enrolled? 
- I think during the application process I didn’t know how it differs from insurance. I thought you were a Veteran you qualify for all this stuffs. I wasn’t really too sure what the VA benefits were. I only got that information from my VA handbook. I learned they charge my insurance if I had outside health insurance. I wish I would have known the VA was not a healthcare insurance. It is still confusing for me. I think if I would have known at the beginning I would have not applied.
  
How have you - if at all - been notified since you enrolled that you had to provide updated information? 
- Not that I know of, just contact information I needed to keep current. I think it was just that. Also, the way I log in is different also. It was a prop that would tell me to confirm my information. I don’t remember getting anything in the mail.

  
Things to watch for:
[What terminology does the Veteran use as they talk about their experience?]
[How does the Veteran portray the overall process - easy, difficult, uneventful?]
[How does the Veteran describe the process of figuring out what they are eligible for - are they frustrated, or do they find it easy?]
[What does the Veteran call out about the process after the initial application and around managing their benefits?]
[What pain points or areas of confusion are revealed?]


### Second Topic: [Priority Group - Awareness] - 5 minutes
Can you tell me more about what Priority Group you are in for your health care benefits now? Can I go get my book? They sent me a little booklet that tells you your benefits and your priority group. They told me what I have access to. Other than that, no one told me about priority levels. It was a lot of self-learning. I found that in the booklet. 
[If aware of Priority Groups]

Can you please describe how this was communicated to you and how you understood the impact to you and your benefits? Just the booklet.
Before you completed enrollment, how were you aware of Priority Groups or copays as part of the health care benefits package?
[if yes] Can you tell me more about what you knew before you applied and how you learned that information?
Since you have been using your benefits, what have you learned about Priority Groups and the impact it has on you and health care benefits that you wish you knew during the application?
[If NOT aware of Priority Groups, ask question and skip to fourth topic]

What do you think Priority Groups are? There is no right or wrong answer here, just explain your understanding of what you think it could be and how that is important to health care benefits.
Things to watch for:
[Do Veterans' confidently know their Priority Group and what that means to them and their benefits?]
[What is the current process and experience around Priority Groups?]
[What are the knowledge gaps around Priority Groups and health care costs?]
[What things would Veterans like to see or like to change in regards to Priority Groups?]
Third Topic: [Priority Group - Future State] - 5 minutes
Where are some places that you would like to be able to view your Priority Group number? Why? In the banner where your name is, or in your profile that is where I would expect it to tell me all my information. I would want to be able to click on it and tell me what that means. This is what you get, that is what I would want and expect from that.
How would this be a benefit to you?
What type of information is important to you to have access to about your Priority Group and your health care benefits?
Is there anything you find confusing about how your Priority Group impacts you today that you wish the VA would provide more clarity on?
Things to watch for:
[Do Veterans call out VA.gov as where they would expect to find this information? Do they list VA Profile?]
[Do Veterans mention other channels to find and manage this information - Profile, MHV, mobile, etc?]
[What information do Veterans want to know about their Priority Group?]
Fourth Topic: [Updates post enrollment] - 5 minutes
Changing directions, a bit now, since you enrolled, have you had to make any updates to your information since your initial application? I think it was just my name. I had to submit a name change because my last name was different from active duty to what it is now. That was such a hassle. That was such a process because I couldn’t do that online, had to do it through a call center and mail them all the stuff. I had to send two different sets to two different places. No one communicated with me during it. I just saw my name change. My address I changed at home. I don’t like the fact you have to change your addresses in so many places to ensure that you get any communications. 
If yes:
Can you please tell me more about that. What did you have to update and how was that experience for you?
How were you notified or how did you find out you needed to supply that updated information?
Is there anything about that experience that you wish you could change?
Did you have to make updates for other benefits too or just health care?
[Financial Disclosure] - 5 minutes
How would you see a change in income impacting your health care benefits? I hope not because I feel like a Veteran I feel we deserve our benefits no matter how you are doing after service. I would hate that. I like the fact that I can do everything in one place. I feel like having these benefits should last forever. Obviously if there is someone under poverty level, they should not have to pay for anything.
How would you want to be notified to provide your updated financial information?
[Dependents] - 5 minutes
Have you ever had a need to make changes to your dependents for VA benefits? If so, can you tell me more about that experience. I did not. I have two children, but they were born after my service. Maybe I should try to add them. I didn’t know I should add them. There was a lot of self-learning because I separated a long time ago. I didn’t even know I could get VA healthcare until someone told me I qualified for it.  Now that I have dependents, I need to add them. I thought it was just for me. When I was in service, I could automatically put them, I didn’t think they could receive anything because I had them after I got out.
Ideally if you had to make changes to your dependents, can you explain to me how you would go about doing that?
Things to watch for:
[What is the current process and pain points when making updates to post enrollment?]
[What type of information is mentioned as what has been or they could see being updated?]
Fifth Topic: [EZR Tasks - SCENARIO] - 10 minutes
I would like to ask if you are comfortable sharing your screen and walking through a task on VA.gov?

Please be sure to close any personal information, like email, Facebook, etc., before you share your screen.

For this scenario, you received a communication to update your annual income to maintain your copay and travel reimbursement costs as part of your health care benefits. I would like to ask you to show me where and how you would expect to accomplish this online.

[Share link to VA.gov in Zoom chat for VA.gov]

[Notification and process]

How would you like to receive this communication that you need to provide updated financial information? 
What would you want to know in this communication about how and why you need to update your financial information? I would like to know how it is going to impact me. I know why you are asking, but I want to know how it will change things for me.
[Where to find]

Now, from the VA.gov home page, can you walk me through where you would expect to go to update your annual income?
Please remember to talk aloud about your thought process as you go.
Can you explain to me why you went [here] to update your financial information? I would sign in because to update anything you have to sign in. I would expect there to be a profile or something that pops up to say read this. It would be better if there was an icon to tell me to update that information. 
Talk to me about where you would expect to find the ability to complete this task and why. -[Possible prompt to remind them that this task is not available today, but want to know where you would expect to find it if it was made available]
[IF they state the would go to the VA Profile to update this information]

Are you comfortable logging in to your own VA profile account?
[If no] Or would you rather have me share my screen and a test account with you and we can talk through the rest of this together? Share your screen.
[Possible prompts]

What would you be looking for when you first login to update this information? Something in the sidebar or a notification? I have never done it. There is my profile under the MY VA may have something. With my experience is that departments don’t talk to each other. If I were to do this I wouldn’t want to go to a certain department I would go to My profile to have it change it for all departments. 
Would you think these fits with any of the existing options or would you expect this to be something new? The only thing I would see would be personal information. Honestly, I would want another tab here that says financial information. It may be under personal information because it does not fall under any other tab.
What would you expect this new section to be called?
[Backup = which test account to login to if there are concerns or issues with screen sharing after they state they would update this in Profile?]

Test user 80
Things to watch for:
[Where does the Veteran initially think to go to access this information? Do they validate hypothesis and go to their profile or do they look in other places to update this information?]
[How does the Veteran expect to find this information from the home page or do they mention notifications or other paths as preferred ways to make these updates?]
[How does the Veteran want to be communicated to and aware of what they need to do in regards to annual income updates?]
Post-Task Interview - 2 minutes
Is there anything else you would like to add about what we talked about today? No, I think that it is easier these days to find things on the site to apply. I think more and more people separate you give more options online, but we need to increase the communication online as well. I guess the emails are tailored to what you already have vs. what you do not have. I am sure now there is a transition process when getting out now rather than when you were discharged a while back when I got out. Yeah, I think more alerts and banners that are in my face would be very helpful. Digging around you could lose your benefits.
Any questions for me?
Thank-You and Closing - 3 minutes
Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
