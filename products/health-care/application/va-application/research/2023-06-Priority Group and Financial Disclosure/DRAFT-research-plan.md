# DRAFT Research Plan for health care application research study around Priority Groups / Financial Disclosure / Dependents [Health Enrollment Team, 10-10EZ, June 2023]

## Background
The online health care application (10-10EZ) and the update form (10-10EZR which is only paper form today) both can impact a Veteran's eligibilty and placement when applying for and managing their health care benefits. This is more so impactful for those placed in a Priority Group who need to have income information considered for copays and travel reimbrusment in addition to eligibility. The 10-10EZ is the initial application that then places a Veteran in a Priority Group for enrollment into the full medical benefits package. The 10-10EZR is used to proivde personal, financial or insurance information updates after enrollment. 

The outcome of this generative research study will help in understanding the Veteran's mental model around health care benefits - as it pertains to getting, understanding and maintaining those benefits - to gain a broad, holistic view and iterate on various hypotheses as the team works towards designing an MVP.

### OCTO Priorities 

Which [OCTO priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202023.md) does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.

- Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience


### Veteran Journey

- This fits accross the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) from **getting out to aging**.

- This impacts a **key moment that matters** in that Veterans need to select the health care coverage according to their individual needs and preferences and that is the best fit for them. 


## Research Goals	

Learn more about Veteran's mental model when applying for and managing their health care benefits including the terms they use and how they understand eligibility and their specific benefits.

Learn more about Veteran's awareness and understanding of their Priority Group placement including how that impacts their benefits as it pertains to financial disclosure, copays and travel reimbursement. 

Learn more about how Veterans would like to go about providing updated information - such as financial information or dependents - that could impact their health care benefits after enrollment.


### Outcomes
We will use these findings to:
- Check assumptions and terminology used to remain Veteran-centric
- Develop insights into an ideal state and how Veteran would prefer to navigate the health care benefits and Priority Group assignment
- Develop insights into how a Veteran would like to find personalized information about Priority Groups and copays online
- Develop insights into where and how a Veteran would expect to be able to update their financial information online

- Where do Veterans call out as the way to manage their health benefits ? the VA profile or MyHelatheVet or the mobile app or (enter method here)
- Do Veterans prefer to provide updated information in person at appointments or over the phone?
- Do income updates cross benefits in the Veteran's POV or do they associate them only with their health care benefits?
- Would Veterans prefer to be prompted to provide updated financials? How/method (text, email, call, mail)?
- Where do Veterans see income updates occurring as it relates to travel pay/PG placement? 
- What information does the Veteran feel they should have to provide vs. what the VA should have/they have to verify?

- Do dependent updates cross benefits in the Veteran's POV or do they associate them only with their health care benefits?
- What is different about the dependent update process from other EZR updates?



### Hypothesis
- We assume the overall process of determining eligibility and being placed in a Priority Group is somewhat unclear to Veterans today.
- We assume that Veterans want more information about Priority Groups and transparency about how that impacts their eligibility and benefits.
- We assume not all Veterans go through the enrollment process in one go, there is often stops, such as an exam and other claims filed in between that could impact their enrollment and Priority Group placement. 
- We assume that Veterans who have health care regularly login to MHV more than VA.gov 
- We assume there is a desire from Veterans for the Priority Group placement to be more clear as it pertains to benefits, copays, costs and travel reimubrusement

* Date and time of pilot session: 

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research:


### Length of sessions
* Session length:  < 1 hour
* Buffer time between sessions: 1 hour
* Maximum Sessions per day: 4

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. *Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.* 

Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***.
