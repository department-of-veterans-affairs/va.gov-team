# DRAFT Research Plan for health care application generative research study around Priority Groups / Financial Disclosure / Dependents [Health Enrollment Team, 10-10EZ, June 2023]

## Background
The online health care application (10-10EZ) and the update form (10-10EZR which is only paper form today) both can impact a Veteran's eligibilty and placement when applying for and managing their health care benefits. This is more so impactful for those placed in a Priority Group who need to have income information considered for copays and travel reimbrusment in addition to eligibility. The 10-10EZ is the initial application that then places a Veteran in a Priority Group for enrollment into the full medical benefits package. The 10-10EZR is used to proivde personal, financial or insurance information updates after enrollment. 

The outcome of this generative research study will help in understanding the Veteran's mental model around health care benefits - as it pertains to getting, understanding and maintaining those benefits - to gain a broad, holistic view and iterate on various hypotheses as the team works towards designing an MVP.

### OCTO Priorities 

Which [OCTO priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202023.md) does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.

- Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience


### Veteran Journey

- This fits accross the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) from **getting out to aging**.

- This impacts a **key moment that matters** in that Veterans need to select the health care coverage according to their individual needs and preferences and that is the best fit for them. 


## Research Goals	

Learn more about Veteran's mental model when applying for and managing their health care benefits including the terms they use and how they understand eligibility and their specific benefits.

Learn more about Veteran's awareness and understanding of their Priority Group placement including how that impacts their benefits as it pertains to financial disclosure, copays and travel reimbursement. 

Learn more about how Veterans would like to go about providing updated information - such as financial information or dependents - that could impact their health care benefits after enrollment.


### Outcomes
We will use these findings to:
- Check assumptions and terminology used to remain Veteran-centric
- Develop insights into an ideal state and how Veteran would prefer to navigate the health care benefits and Priority Group assignment
- Develop insights into how a Veteran would like to find personalized information about Priority Groups and copays online
- Develop insights into where and how a Veteran would expect to be able to update their financial information online

  

### Research questions


**Learn more about Veteran's mental model when applying for and managing their health care benefits including the terms they use and how they understand eligibility and their specific benefits.**

- What is the Veteran's mental model of discovering, getting and keeping health care benefits as they go through the application process?
- What are Veteran's understanding of what benefits they will get and the cost to them while applying for benefits?
- How do Veterans refer to their health care benefits and costs - what terms do they use?

- What are the Veteran's current pain points with how the health care application impacts the overall health care journey?
- What is the order and process expectations of Veterans when they are applying for health care benefits?
- What information do Veterans feel most that the VA has and they should not have to provide?
- What is the Veterans mental model of eligibility and Priority Groups around their benefits and costs?
  

**Learn more about Veteran's awareness and understanding of their Priority Group placement including how that impacts their benefits as it pertains to financial disclosure, copays and travel reimbursement.**

- Do Veterans seem confused by Priority Group transparency prior to applying to enroll?
- What is the communication and education process around Priority Groups like from the Veteran's perspective?
- Do Veterans know their know Priority Group easily or do they just know they are enrolled?
- What is Veteran's attitude towards Priority Groups and eligibility placement?
- What information around PG/copays would the Veteran like to have easy access to and where?
- What is Veteran's attitude towards Priority Groups and copay rates?
- Where do Veterans call out as the way to view their Priority Group information? the VA profile or MyHelatheVet or the mobile app or ...?
- Do Veterans associate Priority Groups more with eligibility or with benefits?

**Learn more about how Veterans would like to go about providing updated information that could impact their health care benefits after enrollment.**

- Where do Veterans call out as the way to manage their health benefits ? the VA profile or MyHelatheVet or the mobile app or (enter method here)
- Do Veterans prefer to provide updated information in person at appointments or over the phone?
- Do income updates cross benefits in the Veteran's POV or do they associate them only with their health care benefits?
- Would Veterans prefer to be prompted to provide updated financials? How/method (text, email, call, mail)?
- Where do Veterans see income updates occurring as it relates to travel pay/PG placement? 
- What information does the Veteran feel they should have to provide vs. what the VA should have/they have to verify?
- Is there frustration about steps or processes after the initial application process in regards to providing more information, filling out additional forms?
- Do dependent updates cross benefits in the Veteran's POV or do they associate them only with their health care benefits?
- What is different about the dependent update process from other EZR updates?



### Hypothesis
- We assume the overall process of determining eligibility and being placed in a Priority Group is somewhat unclear to Veterans today.
- We assume that Veterans want more information about Priority Groups and transparency about how that impacts their eligibility and benefits.
- We assume not all Veterans go through the enrollment process in one go, there is often stops, such as an exam and other claims filed in between that could impact their enrollment and Priority Group placement. 
- We assume that Veterans who have health care regularly login to MHV more than VA.gov 
- We assume there is a desire from Veterans for the Priority Group placement to be more clear as it pertains to benefits, copays, costs and travel reimubrusement

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. *Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.*
