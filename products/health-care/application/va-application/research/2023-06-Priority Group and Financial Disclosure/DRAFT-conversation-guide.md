## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them... 

Today we're going to talk about the health care application experience but mostly focusing on what happens after around benefits and updates.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 1 hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You'll be compensated no matter how much of the session we complete.** 
- Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I want to be sure before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - If yes: Admit observers. 
    - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)
   - Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth
- **Are you comfortable if I record my audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 


## Warm-up Questions  - 3 minutes

Let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

- Are you currently enrolled and using health care benefits from the VA? 
- How often do you visit a VA facility for medical care? 
- How often do you visit VA.gov online? And do you sign in every time or how often do you sign in?
- Do you receive any other benefits beside health care from the VA? Would you mind sharing what those are?
  

## First Topic: [Application Process] - 10 minutes

- Can you explain to me in your own words the process when you applied for health care benefits?
- [If they don't specify] Did you apply online, in-person or via paper application by yourself?
- What resources did you use to understand what health care benefits you might qualify for during this process?
- How would you describe the process that happened after you completed your application, such as things you had to do, additional information you had to provide, communications from the VA, your first appointment, etc.?
- Now that you have been using your benefits, I would like you to think back and recall if there is anything that would have been helpful for you to know during that application process that you learned after you enrolled?


### Things to watch for:
- [What terminology does the Veteran use as they talk about their experience?]
- [How does the Veteran portray the overall process - easy, difficult, uneventful?]
- [How does the Veteran descirbe the process of figuring out what they are eligible for - are they frustrated or do they find it easy?]
- [What pain points or areas of confusion are revealed?]


## Second Topic: [Priority Group Awareness] - 5 minutes
- Do you know what Priority Group you are in for your health care benefits now?
- Can you please describe how this was communicated to you and how you understood the impact to you and your benefits?
- Before you completed enrollment, were you aware of Priority Groups or copays as part of the health care benefits package?
- [if yes] Can you tell me more about what you knew before you applied and how you learned that information?
- Since you have been using your benefits, what do you now know about Priority Groups and the impact it has on you and health care benefits?
- If you had a magic wand, can you describe to me what you would change in regards to health care groups and benefits?


### Things to watch for:
- [Do Veterans' confidently know their Priority Group and what that means to them and their benefits?]
- [What is the current process and experience around Prioity Groups?]
- [What are the knowledge gaps around Priority Groups and health care costs?]

Cohort Scenarios (Possible 3 or 4), 
start by showing current live alert message (no page placement) and iterate to showing more of a wireframe including content updates and context placement based on feedback of previous cohorts. 


## Third Topic: [Priority Group - SCENARIO] - 10 minutes

- I'm going to share my screen for this next question.
- [Open Mural board with image]
- This message (screen capture of current enrolled Alert) appears to communicate that you are currently enrolled in health care.
- Have you ever seen this message before on VA.gov?
- Where would you expect to find this message or this type of health care benefit information online?
- What information about your benefits do you feel is missing from this message that you would find helpful?
- Would being able to view your Priority Group online be of value to you and how would you see that working for you?


---

## Fourth Topic: [Updates post enrollment] - 5 minutes
- Changing gears a bit now, since you enrolled, have you had to make any updates to your information since your initial application?
- If yes, can you please tell me more about that. What did you have to update and how was that experience for you?
- Is there anything about this experience that you would like to change?

  
## Fifth Topic: [EZR Tasks - SCENARIO] - 10 minutes

- Now I would like to transition to you sharing your screen and have you go to the link in the chat for VA.gov:
- https://va.gov/
  
- For this first scenario, you completed the health care application and are now enrolled in and using your health care benefits. You had a change in income and want to report that.
- Can you show me where you would expect to find the ability to complete this task?



For this second scenario, 




## Sixth Topic: [Financial Disclosure] - 10 minutes

- How would you see a change in income impacting your health care benefits?
- If you have copays, when during the enrollment process were you clear on what you qualified for and what you would have to pay? 


## Fourth Topic: [Ideal State] - 5 minutes
- Could you describe how - in a perfect world - you would **want** the health care application process to go for you? From learning what you qualify for, applying and using your benefits and updating your information. 
- What tools, communication, people could make this the best process possible in your mind?
- What information would be important to you so you feel confident when having to apply for and use your health care benefits?


### Things to watch for:
- [Are there any terminology used that stand out as the Veteran is describing their ideal process?]
- [What steps do they call out?]
- [What steps do they leave out?]
- [What do they mention or call out as information that is helpful in making decisions about health care benefits?]





## Post-Task Interview - 2 minutes

- Is there anything else you would like to add about what we talked about today?
- Any questions for me? 


## Thank-You and Closing - 3 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
