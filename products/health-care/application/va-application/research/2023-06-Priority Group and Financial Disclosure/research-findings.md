## Research Goals
The online health care application (10-10EZ) and the update form (10-10EZR which is only paper form today) can both impact a Veteran's eligibility and placement when applying for and managing their health care benefits. This is more so impactful for those placed in a Priority Group who need to have income information considered for copays and travel reimbursement in addition to eligibility. The 10-10EZ is the initial application that then places a Veteran in a Priority Group for enrollment into the full medical benefits package. The 10-10EZR is used to provide personal, financial or insurance information updates after enrollment.

The outcome of this generative research study will help in understanding the Veteran's mental model around health care benefits as it pertains to understanding and maintaining those benefits - specifically around awareness of their Priority Group and that impact as well as updating financial information after initial enrollment.


## Research Questions
### Understanding of health care benefits
- What are Veteran's understanding of what benefits they will get and the cost to them when enrolling for health care benefits?
- What are Veteran's understanding of what benefits they will get and the cost to them after enrollment?
- What are the Veteran's current pain points with how the health care application impacts the overall health care journey?
- What is the Veterans mental model of eligibility and Priority Groups around their benefits and costs?
### Priority groups
- Do Veterans seem confused by Priority Group transparency prior to applying for enrollment?
- Do Veterans know their know Priority Group easily or do they just know they are enrolled?
- What is the communication and education process around Priority Groups like from the Veteran's perspective today? (current state)
- Where do Veterans call out as their preferred way to view their Priority Group information?
### Updating information
- How would Veterans like to go about providing updated information - such as financial information or dependents - that could impact their health care benefits after enrollment?


## Methodology 
We conducted hour-long moderated semi-structured interviews, including one task-based scenario, on Zoom from July 27-August 9, 2023.


## Hypotheses and Conclusions
1. We assume the overall process of determining eligibility and being placed in a Priority Group is somewhat unclear to Veterans today.
   1. **TRUE**: 8 out of 12 Veteran participants either had no understanding of what a Priority Group was, or were only somewhat familiar with the term and their associated benefits.
2. We assume that Veterans want more information about Priority Groups and transparency about how that impacts their eligibility and benefits.
   1. **TRUE**: 10 out of 12 Veterans
3. We assume not all Veterans go through the enrollment process in one go, there is often stops, such as an exam and other claims filed in between that could impact their enrollment and Priority Group placement.
   1. **MAYBE TRUE**: Several Veteran participants conflated the disability claim process with the health care enrollment process. Because disability rate is important for some Priority Groups and not for others, it's difficult to come to an 
4. We assume there is a desire from Veterans for the Priority Group placement to be more clear as it pertains to benefits, copays, costs and travel reimbursement.
   1. **MAYBE TRUE**: Most Veterans responded positively to the idea of Priority Group info being more conveniently placed and more clear, but some were ambivalent or did not consider Priority Group info important to their own access of health care benefits.
5. We assume that Veterans would like to update their financial information online if it was available but need a clear way to be communicated to or notified that they have to do so.
   1. **TRUE**: All 12 participants responded that they would prefer notification (email, push notifications in the app, a letter) to update their financial information if/when they needed to do so.
6. We think that Veterans will go to the VA profile to update personal information like financial updates annually.
   1. **TRUE**: 11 out of 12 Veterans navigated to or mentioned the VA Profile when prompted to go to the part of VA.gov where they would expect to update financial information.


## Key Findings

1. Veterans expect to update their financial information for health care benefits somewhere in their VA Profile.
2. Veterans want notifications to update financial information for health care benefits including a link and additional context.
3. Veterans don't know/don't need to know how income impacts their health care benefits if they are over a certain percent of service connected disability rating.
4. There's a blurry line between disability benefits and health care benefits for Veterans who have gone through the process of filing claims for service connected disabilities.
5. More explanation is needed for Priority Groups around what they are and how they impact health care benefits and are connected to disability ratings.
6. Veterans express enthusiasm for the current online options to update health care information and want even more online flexibility and functionality.



## Details of Findings 


**Veterans expect to update their financial info in the VA Profile**


An overwhelming majority (11 out of 12 participants) navigated to or mentioned the Profile as the place they would look for the ability to update financial information.

**Finding detail**
- 11 out of 12 Veterans said they would expect to update their financial information in the Profile.
- 1 Veteran said they would want to update their financial information in My Health.

> P2: "I imagine my financial info would be under my profile. It makes sense because it's me and my information."

> P3: "It is just where I know where to go to change my address, so it makes sense to be able to change any other personal information."


**Veterans want notifications to update financial information**


Veterans expressed that they wanted communications if they needed to update their financial information, ranging from email to text to in-app notifications.

**Finding detail**
- 7 out of 12 Veterans would prefer an email notification, preferably with a link to where they could accomplish this task
- 5 out of 12 Veterans would prefer a notification in the VA app

> P5: "I think an email would be best because VA letters are very behind. I think an email where I can click a link where I can just update the information."

> P3: "Because I use the VA.gov so much it would be nice to have a red thing on top to tell you what you need to update. Something that sticks out and you would not be able to ignore."


**Veterans don't know/don't need to know how income impacts their benefits**


Depending on a Veteran’s disability rating (ex: if their rating is high) they may not need to know how income impacts their benefits. Income is only relevant for certain priority groups.

**Finding detail**
- 2 of 12 unknown disability rating
- 2 of 12 under 50% disability rating
- 8 of 12 over 50% disability rating
- 3 of 12 didn't know
- 4 of 12 said income would matter
- 5 of 12 said income wouldn't matter

> P2: "For me it doesn’t matter because I have 100%. For others I can imagine they would rely on it more because of the copays that may vary with your income."

> P7: "I don’t think my income is sufficient enough to impact anything."


**There's a blurry line between disability benefits and health care benefits**


Veterans conflated disability benefits and the disability compensation process with health care benefits and the healthcare application process, especially when it related to Priority Groups.

**Finding detail**
- 6 out of 12 Veterans mentioned disability rating when discussing their knowledge of Priority Groups
- 3 out of 12 Veterans described their disability application process when asked about the health care application process

> P7: "They gave me my VA disability and my healthcare came with it. I think I filled out the application online and it was pretty painless from what I remember.”

> P14: “I’m guessing that priority group is based off disability rating, but I wouldn't even know where to find that. I assume the more disabled you are, the more priority you have.”


**More explanation needed for Priority Groups**


Veterans would benefit from convenient placement of their Priority Group number as well as additional explanation about how priority groups work and what benefits are available to them.

**Finding detail**
- 4 out of 12 Veterans were unfamiliar with Priority Groups entirely, while 5 more Veterans were only somewhat familiar with the term — they may know their group number, but don't have a clear understanding of what it means
- 5 out of 12 Veterans expressed an interest in seeing their Priority Group number and what that means to them in their VA Profile


> P4: "I don’t know what they are. I think word of mouth someone mentioned there is a certain priority group that will allow you to schedule appointments online and some that will not, but I don't know if that is correct. I learn a lot about the VA is from word of mouth. The website just has a lot of information and it can be a lot."

> P12: "I think it said I was a Priority 1 based on my rating. Maybe some parts of the country it carries more weight than others. Based on the other priorities, maybe it gets me seen sooner? I don’t recall what I read about that."


**Veterans want a more robust online experience**


Veterans expressed enthusiasm for the current online options available, such as applying for health care benefits online or utilizing the VA app to read messages from providers. But they also expressed a desire for more flexibility and functionality within these online services.

**Finding detail**
- 3 out of 12 Veterans mentioned that applying for health care and/or making updates to their information online was “easy” or “painless.”
- 2(? maybe more) out of 12 Veterans expressed frustration with slow or lacking communications from VA, such as delayed letters in the mail or online statuses that never updated

> P8: "Having the stuff online is incredible because it makes it so easy for you to do yourself.”

> P7: “I would love if everything went through the app. I don’t go anywhere without my phone.”

> P1: “For my name change, I couldn’t complete it online. Had to call in and mail a bunch of stuff. There was no insight given into the name change process…it just happened without notification. It would be good to get more communications online."




## Additional Insights

* Veterans rely heavily on word-of-mouth and in-person assistance for application process
* Veterans can have challenges with facilities — there can be a high burden on Veterans when they first enroll, shuffling them from facility to facility to cover their first appointment(s)
* There's a confusing post-enrollment process


## Recommendations

* Provide a clear access point on the VA.gov Profile to update health enrollment information, including financial information.
   * VA.gov Profile access point is in addition to other VA.gov cross linking opportunities.
* Use VA.gov-based content (unauthenticated and authenticated pages) to increase awareness about the impact of financial information on health care benefits.
* Explore push and other types of notifications that direct Veterans to VA.gov to update health enrollment information when needed.



## Next Steps

We will work with the rest of the 1010 team, our stakeholders, and the Authenticated Experience team to pilot a new online version of the 10-10EZR, making the form accessible (either through a link or other means) where it makes the most sense for Veterans to find.
