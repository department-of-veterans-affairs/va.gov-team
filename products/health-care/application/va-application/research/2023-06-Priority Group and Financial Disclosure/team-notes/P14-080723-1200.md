# Conversation Guide for health care application generative research study around Priority Groups and Financial Disclosure Updates [Health Enrollment Team, 10-10EZ, July 2023]

## P14
**August 7, 2023 at 12pm ET / 9am PT**

Some takeaways from this one:
- Another person unfamiliar with priority groups primarily because they have a high service disability rating.
- Interesting that they wanted important info in messages in the app since they may miss email or notifications in the app.
- Wanted to update financial info in My Health, mainly because that was familiar. But called the whole menu the Profile, kind of.

## First Topic: [Application Process] - 10 minutes

[Can you explain to me in your own words the process when you applied for health care benefits?]
> Um, yeah I don't remember if I went thorugh eBenefits or VA.gov.

> The disabilty claims or going on site




[[If they don't specify] Did you apply online, in-person or via paper application by yourself?]
- In person health
- Enrolled here in Prescot



[What resources did you use to understand what health care benefits you might qualify for during this process?]
> So there is alot of email that gets sent out, from VA.gov I think,
> Recently they talk about the PACT act and everything, hear a lot of things from those.
> When I am having issues, start with my doctor
> See if that is something I can claim later


[How would you describe the process that happened after you completed your application, such as things you had to do, additional information you had to provide, communications from the VA, your first appointment, etc.?]
> I am trying to remember back to 2018
> I remember they set up the ititial appointmetn
> Eligibility and enrollment
> Get a picture and get a VA ID
> I think that gets mailed to you, I believe
> You get to pick you team, you can switch
> They talked about differnent things going on, events, things to help other Veterans
> Trying to think what happened after that, had my appointmetns
> Authoriziations from the VA Community Care team
> They have the app now that you can text them on and that is nice
[before app]
> Communication in person, the only way to get ahold of them before the app was to call
> You used to be able to get right to your team, but now it goes to a call center
> You can, the app is great, it only works like half the time.
> Don't know if it is the service, take of wifi, it won't respond. Just keeps circling and loading and I do have to call the call center.
> Yeah, 50% of the time it works. 


[Now that you have been using your benefits, I would like you to think back and recall if there is anything that would have been helpful for you to know during your application process that you have learned after you enrolled?]
> I never knew right away that I could switch teams.
> There is a designated team at Prescot for women.
> I wish they would have told me, I have medical, I left medically.
> I have some medical issues, it took a little while to get going on my appointmetns that I need.
> Took a little while for the chiropractor, didn't tell me I could get
> TO know what I could have asked for for my pain, didn't know that was an option
> Evenutally I got it, but that was 2 years later.
> That is a big help to me, time for another conversations would be about the VA authorizations.
> A big issue with the one place in town that takes VA auth for 12 services, I try not to go more than once a week and push to every other, but you get 12 visits
> When you are out of that, request more, but by the time renewed and out of benefits and that company is now 2 months out for appointments.
> That is one big struggle. 

> List of benefits, targeted to disability, a big list would have been nice. 

[How have you - if at all - been notified since you enrolled that you had to provide updated information?]


> they ways that I get contacted the app occasionaly, email, and then paper copy
> They are always sending me paper stuff. 



### Things to watch for:

      - 
- [What pain points or areas of confusion are revealed?]


## Second Topic: [Priority Group - Awareness] - 5 minutes
[Can you tell me more about what Priority Group you are in for your health care benefits now?]
> I am trying to think what the Priority Groups are, what is that referencing?


[If NOT aware of Priority Groups, ask question and skip to fourth topic]
[What do you think Priority Groups are? There is no right or wrong answer here, just explain your understanding of what you think it could be and how that is important to health care benefits.]

> I would assume it is based off of disability.
> I don't even know where to find that.
> I would assume the more disabled you  are the more disabled
> They never talk about Priortity GRoup unless it is something at the begining.

[Where are some places that you would like to be able to view your Priority Group number? Why?]
> On the VA app
> Does that have to do if you are service connected and have that copay thing?
> I guess if it was related to the copay, then it would matter how much you pay for medications
> For me I use everything for the VA as much as I possible can
> I don't know what group I am in, but I am service connected



[How would this be a benefit to you?]

[What type of information is important to you to have access to about your Priority Group and your health care benefits?]
[Is there anything you find confusing about how your Priority Group impacts you today that you wish the VA would provide more clarity on?]

> It does take a while to get those authorization back.
> It would nice for me to get in somewhere else and get my services done there, go out and experiment and try different things.

> Just need to increase my own benefits is what I mean there.

[Opens VA Benefits and Health Care menu]
[Goes to name, and don't know what it is under, try My Health first.]

> Yeah, I think so, anywhere that is under your Profile, your personal information.
> How to update your pay.
> I was trying to remember how I did it for EFT for my disability claim, to where what bank account my money is going in to.
> I don't think it was on this page at all, maybe under disability claims and then update your direct deposit or something.

[redirected to Proifle in name menu]

> I think it would be, this is a nice page because it is an overview of everything.
> I see it doesn't say the Priority thing that we were talking about earlier.
> This would be another good place to put update your informaiton.
> Yeah, here is the manage your direct deposit informaiton.
> I can change my bank account for that, but there is not anywhere else that it is hard to find, other than my profile would be my first assumption.


[moderator directs to open profile since that is first assumption]
[Open Profile]
[Clicks on Direct Deposit]

> so bank information...
> Have to login with ID me all over again.
> That's where I would go for that, but I would assume travel pay would go through your direct deposit informaiton, whatever bank is linked to that, but it doesn't day

[want something specific to travel pay, what to be called]
> Travel Pay Direct Deposit would be good, or under the regular direct deposit. 
> A little blurb of information that this is going to update your travel pay as well
> I wouldn't want too many options of how many direct deposits I need to update in one place and that is it for everything.
> A breakdown of disability income, and a section just travel pay. Select a different bank account for that or Just click a button for same bank account. That would be nice. Not too many things to find. 
**> I don't want to search too far for it.**
> If most people can get to this page it would probably be okay to find the travel pay stuff.

[directs to menu, clarify profile from MyHealth]
> Maybe I will just see what is under here, maybe it will lead to more.
> Sometimes Profiles are not very specific, don't have a lot of information
> You said travel pay, so that is why I thought My Health.
> Sometimes when I go to MyVA stuff it takes you to some link to go to the My health via a link anyways, so I just thought let me try My Health E Benefits first.




### Things to watch for:
- [Where does the Veteran initially think to go to access this information? Do they validate hypothesis and go to their profile or do they look in other places to update this information?]
- [How does the Veteran expect to find this information from the home page or do they mention notifications or other paths as preferred ways to make these updates?]
- [How does the Veteran want to be communicated to and aware of what they need to do in regards to annual income updates?]

## Post-Task Interview - 2 minutes

[Is there anything else you would like to add about what we talked about today?]
> No, I guess the only comment about the VA website in general, it would be really nice to not have to sign in so many times.
> If you click another button, it signs you out and you have to sign in again.
> An easier way to do that would be nice.
> It logs you out alot sometimes.
> Like direct deposit, you have to sign in through ID.me, I already signed into my healthe benefits so why do I need to sign in again. 

[Any questions for me?]
