[How long have you been enrolled in and using health care benefits from the VA?]

> Since 2017.

[How often do you visit VA.gov online and do you sign in every time you visit?]

## First Topic: [Application Process] - 10 minutes

[Can you explain to me in your own words the process when you applied for health care benefits?]

> It was really easy to apply. I didn't know much about what benefits were available. Only started using it two years ago. Didn't know could schedule visits online. Thought it was complicated because it was the military. Called them and was told could schedule it online. Now using it for all healthcare related things.

[If they don't specify, Did you apply online, in-person or via paper application by yourself?]

> Applied online.

[What resources did you use to understand what health care benefits you might qualify for during this process?]

- TBH, the application process was a one pager, maybe 10 questions.
  > Didn't know what resources, after hitting submit, health benefit wise, were avaialble to me.

[How would you describe the process that happened after you completed your application, such as things you had to do, additional information you had to provide, communications from the VA, your first appointment, etc.?]

> I don't remember receiving any information. Not much interaction with health care.
> I think I did get something in the mail, not a phone call.

[Now that you have been using your benefits, I would like you to think back and recall if there is anything that would have been helpful for you to know during your application process that you have learned after you enrolled?]

> On confirmation page, after you submit, would have good to see a pamphlet of the information of the benefits. I am there and focused on the information, walked away and out of sight and out of mind.
- Benefits available

[How have you - if at all - been notified since you enrolled that you had to provide updated information?]

> I can't without logging in.

[If NOT aware of Priority Groups, ask question and skip to fourth topic]
[What do you think Priority Groups are? There is no right or wrong answer here, just explain your understanding of what you think it could be and how that is important to health care benefits.]

> I don't know what they are. Heard from someone that certain priority groups allow you to schedule your appointments online. Some won't allow you. Not sure it's correct, but that's what I heard.

> **The thing about the VA.gov website there is just so much information. Sites are embedded in other sites. It can be a lot.**

> On the website at the top, button near my name it says Premium and I am guessing that is my Priority Group.
> Open it up it gives more details and the account types, wither Basuc ir Premium. and tells me the difference between the two
> With a basic account access medical libariers and personal data
> with Premium you have full access to your health records, sending messages, managing appointments
> That is what I was thinking of and I have heard
