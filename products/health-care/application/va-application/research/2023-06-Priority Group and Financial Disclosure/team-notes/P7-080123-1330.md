# Conversation Guide for health care application generative research study around Priority Groups and Financial Disclosure Updates [Health Enrollment Team, 10-10EZ, July 2023]
## P7

**P7 Research takeaway**
- Community care has a different experience in health care than other  health-related benefits.
- Wasn't familar with priority groups, but understood the basic concept. Wasn't sure how it would impact his benefits.
- Doesn't think income would impact bemefots.
- Would love if everything went through the app. "I don't go anywhere without my phone."
- Mentions Profile when wanting to update dependents.
- Used Login.gov for login.
- For finanacial info, navigated to Profile. And wanted it to be there because it was personal information. Mentioned a Personal financial information section and maybe direct deposit would be under that. Also, mentioned connecting IRS info to VA account.

- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners, if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?**

## Warm-up Questions  - 3 minutes

[- How long have you been enrolled in and using health care benefits from the VA?]
   - *Maybe a year.*

[- How often do you visit VA.gov online and do you sign in every time you visit?]
   - *Don't visit that often, around every three month, wishes appointment shows up in the app.*
   - *Appeal in the process for Disability Rating.*

> I am on Community Care so my appointments don’t show up in the app, I wish they did that would make things a lot easier.
I have an appeal in process for my disability rating. Once every 3 months or so I go on. And usually I have to sing in with login.gov with the update I don’t have to do that all the time, I can’t remember if it signs in on it’s now or not


## First Topic: [Application Process] - 10 minutes

[- Can you explain to me in your own words the process when you applied for health care benefits?]
   - *The VA calls and instructed the participant to create an online account.*
   - *Online application, very painless (setting up the account).*
   > Well they gave me my VA disability rating for my tinnitus, and my health care care with it. I think I filled out the application online and it was pretty painless from what I remember. 
   > They called me on the phone and signed me up for it. 
   > I went online and setup my account and all that, they called me on the phone first, then I had to go online and create an account and all that and it would be setup for me.

[- What resources did you use to understand what health care benefits you might qualify for during this process?]
   - *Qualification for medical was explained by a young man over the phone.*
   - *Did not qualify for travel reimbursement, dental or vision since disability rating was not high enough.*

[- How would you describe the process that happened after you completed your application, such as things you had to do, additional information you had to provide, communications from the VA, your first appointment, etc.?]
   - *Communication through letter. Communication through the App is helpful.

[- Now that you have been using your benefits, I would like you to think back and recall if there is anything that would have been helpful for you to know during your application process that you have learned after you enrolled?]
   - *Communication between Community Care and the VA Care would be helpful. Maybe a system for Community Care to enter in the VA system.*

[- How have you - if at all - been notified since you enrolled that you had to provide updated information?]
   - * I do not recall any communication.*


### Things to watch for:
- [What terminology does the Veteran use as they talk about their experience?]
   - community care, signed up for them
- [How does the Veteran portray the overall process - easy, difficult, uneventful?]
- [How does the Veteran describe the process of figuring out what they are eligible for - are they frustrated or do they find it easy?]
- [What does the Veteran call out about the process after the initial application and around managing their benefits?]
- [What pain points or areas of confusion are revealed?]


## Second Topic: [Priority Group - Awareness] - 5 minutes
- Can you tell me more about what Priority Group you are in for your health care benefits now?
   - *Not familiar, only knows about disability.*


[If NOT aware of Priority Groups, ask question and skip to fourth topic]
- What do you think Priority Groups are? There is no right or wrong answer here, just explain your understanding of what you think it could be and how that is important to health care benefits.
   - *Related to Disability Rating. If at VA Care, the Priority Group would be shifted around accorindly with higher Disability Rating being the priority.*




### Things to watch for:
- [Do Veterans' confidently know their Priority Group and what that means to them and their benefits?]
- [What is the current process and experience around Priority Groups?]
- [What are the knowledge gaps around Priority Groups and health care costs?]
- [What things would Veterans like to see or like to change in regards to Priority Groups?]

## Third Topic: [Priority Group - Future State] - 5 minutes
- Where are some places that you would like to be able to view your Priority Group number? Why?
- How would this be a benefit to you?
- What type of information is important to you to have access to about your Priority Group and your health care benefits?
- Is there anything you find confusing about how your Priority Group impacts you today that you wish the VA would provide more clarity on?


### Things to watch for:
- [Do Veterans call out VA.gov as where they would expect to find this information? Do they list VA Profile?]
- [Do Veterans mention other channels to find and manage this information - Profile, MHV, mobile, etc?]

## Fourth Topic: [Updates post enrollment] - 5 minutes
- Changing directions a bit now, since you enrolled, have you had to make any updates to your information since your initial application?

   - Can you please tell me more about that. What did you have to update and how was that experience for you?
   - How were you notified or how did you find out you needed to supply that updated information?
   - Is there anything about that experience that you wish you could change?
   - Did you have to make updates for other benefits too or just health care?


## [Financial Disclosure] - 5 minutes
- How would you see a change in income impacting your health care benefits?
- How would you want to be notified to provide your updated financial information?
   - *Through the phone. This is the 21st century, I use the phone more than the computer.*


## [Dependents] - 5 minutes
- Have you ever had a need to make changes to your dependents for VA benefits? If so, can you tell me more about that experience.
   - *I imagine the website.*
- Ideally if you had to make changes to your dependents, can you explain to me how you would go about doing that?
   - *My Profile would make the most sense.*


### Things to watch for:
- [What is the current process and pain points when making updates to post enrollment?]

## Fifth Topic: [EZR Tasks - SCENARIO] - 10 minutes

- I would like to ask if you are comfortable sharing your screen and walking through a task on VA.gov?
- Please be sure to close any personal information, like email, Facebook, etc., before you share your screen.

- For this scenario, you received a communication to update your annual income to maintain your copay and travel reimbursement costs as part of your health care benefits. I would like to ask you to show me where and how you would expect to accomplish this online. 



[Notification and process]
- How would you like to receive this communication that you need to provide updated financial information?
   - *Fine with electronic communication (email, notification through the app is preferable).*
- What would you want to know in this communication about how and why you need to update your financial information?
   - *I don't need to know anything, just want to know what the VA needs from me.*

[Where to find]
[- Now, from the VA.gov home page, can you walk me through where you would expect to go to update your annual income?]
   > Expect it to be in the Profile since it has my personal information and Direct Desposit Information. I would expect Direct Desposit Information to be under Financial Information. All else fails, I go to the Search.*

- Can you explain to me why you went [here] to update your financial information?
- Talk to me about where you would expect to find the ability to complete this task and why.
-[Possible prompt to remind them that this task is not available today, but want to know where you would expect to find it if it was made available]
   - *Expect the Goverment to connect VA with the IRS (after asking the Veteran) under a Financial Information section.*

[**IF** they state the would go to the VA Profile to update this information]
- Are you comfortable logging in to your own VA profile account? 
- [If no] Or would you rather have me share my screen and a test account with you and we can talk through the rest of this together?

> I would actually expect my Direct Deposit information to be under my Personal Financial information, just part of it you know. An account or deposit, 
> You would think the VA would tie directly into the IRS but I know it is the government and there are laws dividing everything.
Do I have your consent to connect your VA account to your IRS account and download the information into the VA, that is fine.

> Personal Finance information or something similar. That has a payment history down here. I would expect it that Direct Deposit to fall under Personal Finance information.

### Things to watch for:
- [Where does the Veteran initially think to go to access this information? Do they validate hypothesis and go to their profile or do they look in other places to update this information?]

   - New section called "Personal Finance Information"
   - Expects Direct Deposit/Payments and Income to be grouped under this title
- [How does the Veteran expect to find this information from the home page or do they mention notifications or other paths as preferred ways to make these updates?]
   - 
- [How does the Veteran want to be communicated to and aware of what they need to do in regards to annual income updates?]
   - Notified electronic method, mentions app notifications
