[from Slack Feedback-backchannel]
A few takeaways:
- Participant is unhappy with the login experience.
- Very interesting to see the mobile experience. She mentioned it feels very stripped down and vague in information. She  would use the desktop website if she could.
- The application process itself was very simple, the frustration seems to be around providing the content she needs and the wait time on the phone (1-15. hours) before talking to a person.

## Warm-up Questions  - 3 minutes

[How long have you been enrolled in and using health care benefits from the VA?]
  > Started receiving health care benefits from the VA, September of last year. 


[How often do you visit VA.gov online and do you sign in every time you visit?]
 > Probably visit once or twice a month and sign in about 60% of the time.

[reason]
> because it is annoying to do the two-step verification every time. The two-step verification drives me crazy.  

## First Topic: [Application Process] - 10 minutes

[Can you explain to me in your own words the process when you applied for health care benefits?]
> the process with the VA was fine. 
It was receiving my DD214 from the military that took, it took almost a month for them to get it to me. 
> I couldn’t prove I was a Veteran until I received that, which meant everything was on hold.

> Apart from waiting on hold on the phone for an hour half numerous times in order to talk to someone, the process is really smooth and the representatives are nice and courteous. 

[[If they don't specify] Did you apply online, in-person or via paper application by yourself?]

> On the phone a lot, because I had questions about what I was exactly signing up for, what the benefits were, how the decision was taken, what exactly I needed to submit.

> Eventually submitted it online, once I had all the documentation but questions leading up to receiving the insurance, a lot on the phone. 

- application online, called via phone for clarification

[What resources did you use to understand what health care benefits you might qualify for during this process?]

> I know I used the VA website
> Representatives on the phone
> TAP class was .. familiar with?

> A class military members required to take in person or online and tells them about life after they get out of the military and how the VA can help them. 
> Never heard of VA anything until that class, about a month before I got out of the military.
> Very helpful. 




[How would you describe the process that happened after you completed your application, such as things you had to do, additional information you had to provide, communications from the VA, your first appointment, etc.?]

> Very smooth
> Doctor, herself, chose Community Care
> Because it is a lot closer to where I live than the VA health Facilities
> I can only change her once a year, so I am not sure if our options for VA care are limited by the VA health insurance, if I had a wider selection of doctors otherwise. 
> Received VA health community care and choose a doctor at the hospital location closest to me


[Now that you have been using your benefits, I would like you to think back and recall if there is anything that would have been helpful for you to know during your application process that you have learned after you enrolled?]

> I did not know community care was an option. I Thought I would have to drive to half an hour to the doctor, but found out there’s closer locations
> Became clearer… disability benefits is different than health care, right?
> the Hawaii VA, smooth process pretty staighforward.
> Like an hour and a half sometimes. 


[How have you - if at all - been notified since you enrolled that you had to provide updated information?]
> They seem to ask every single time I call, confirming my addresss.
> That is a lot, like 15 times in the past year
> But I mean, every single time?


### Things to watch for:
- [What terminology does the Veteran use as they talk about their experience?]
      - 
- [How does the Veteran portray the overall process - easy, difficult, uneventful?]
      - 
- [How does the Veteran describe the process of figuring out what they are eligible for - are they frustrated or do they find it easy?]
      - 
- [What does the Veteran call out about the process after the initial application and around managing their benefits?]
      - 
- [What pain points or areas of confusion are revealed?]


## Second Topic: [Priority Group - Awareness] - 5 minutes
[Can you tell me more about what Priority Group you are in for your health care benefits now?]

> I started off as Priority Group 3 or 4, I don’t know. I was paying $8 or $11 for medicine.
> then I got my disability rating, and I am Group 1 I think

[If aware of Priority Groups]
[Can you please describe how this was communicated to you and how you understood the impact to you and your benefits?]

> The first time, it was on the phone she told me. Because they had enough information to make a judgement at that point.And that was a surprise. I was very thankful such was even possible.  

> Physical letter in the mail later on. 

> There might have been an email, it seems like everything comes in paper.
> I have called and asked in the past if they can email it to me , and they are like oh yeah that’s fine. 

[Before you completed enrollment, how were you aware of Priority Groups or copays as part of the health care benefits package?]

> I wasn’t really clear on this.
> Only learned VA offered health care for Veterans who are not completely 


[if yes, Can you tell me more about what you knew before you applied and how you learned that information?]

[Since you have been using your benefits, what have you learned about Priority Groups and the impact it has on you and health care benefits that you wish you knew during the application?]

[If NOT aware of Priority Groups, ask question and skip to fourth topic]
[What do you think Priority Groups are? There is no right or wrong answer here, just explain your understanding of what you think it could be and how that is important to health care benefits.]

- Priority Groups are the amount you will pay and the rapidity of which you will be seen at a doctor. 


### Things to watch for:
- [Do Veterans' confidently know their Priority Group and what that means to them and their benefits?]

- When I sign into the VA and go to the health care section. Do these changes, is this a lifetime thing? Something on there that says this is valid until such a date..

If the date is getting close and I might lose my health insurance. 


- [What is the current process and experience around Priority Groups?]
- [What are the knowledge gaps around Priority Groups and health care costs?]
- [What things would Veterans like to see or like to change in regards to Priority Groups?]

## Third Topic: [Priority Group - Future State] - 5 minutes
[Where are some places that you would like to be able to view your Priority Group number? Why?]
[How would this be a benefit to you?]
> Better to plan of the future, 
[What type of information is important to you to have access to about your Priority Group and your health care benefits?]
> What the priority groups mean, how many times can I go to Urgent Care during the year.
> A more visible way there is a nurse advice line, I think. There is a nurse line I think. A reminder and phone number for that. 
> I have it on a piece of paper, somebody gave it to me when I went to the VA.
> A visible format.

[Is there anything you find confusing about how your Priority Group impacts you today that you wish the VA would provide more clarity on?]

> It is pretty clear once its broken down. 


### Things to watch for:
- [Do Veterans call out VA.gov as where they would expect to find this information? Do they list VA Profile?]

---

## Fifth Topic: [EZR Tasks - SCENARIO] - 10 minutes


[Notification and process]
[How would you like to receive this communication that you need to provide updated financial information?]
> Email
> Secondary would be a letter in the mail

[What would you want to know in this communication about how and why you need to update your financial information?]
> I want to know accurate information of how to access this on the website in an updated way.
> Sometimes information is provided, I have received emails in the VA for the start transition thing for the year after you get out, anyway some of the links are outdated that they send. 
> A nice gesture, but it doesn’t really help me. 
> Where on the website I should do this
> What I need to do this, so if I am in the middle of this then I don’t have to go find some proof of whatever financial statement and then have to figure out how to upload it. 

[mobile preference question]

[Where to find]

> Either that or according to this list it’s not health care and benefits it is not about the VA. So I don’t know where else is should be.. 
> These things are all dependent on that information


> Under benefits in the health care 
> Or MY VA in the Profile
> It is not related to any specific category, housing or disability or eduction all things are contingent on the information entered in some way.


> Maybe on, I would expect to see here. My VA, Update your information.

[A banner or notification to update your information]

### Things to watch for:
- [Where does the Veteran initially think to go to access this information? Do they validate hypothesis and go to their profile or do they look in other places to update this information?]

## Post-Task Interview - 2 minutes

[Is there anything else you would like to add about what we talked about today?]

> Functionality is limited on the phone, don’t tell you as much information.
> Basic use if fine, but uploading documents or getting details

[Any questions for me?]
