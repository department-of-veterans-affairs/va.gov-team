Quick takeaways:
- Goes to VA.gov and MHV occasionally (~1/month) to accomplish tasks
- Aware of priority groups but not so much how they impact healthcare, could use more context there
- Would go to the Profile first to update anything

## Warm-up Questions  - 3 minutes

[How long have you been enrolled in and using health care benefits from the VA?]
> Gosh, probably like 7 plus years.

[How often do you visit VA.gov online and do you sign in every time you visit?]
> So maybe every couple of months when I need to research something
> I typically don't sign in unless it is required for some reason

## First Topic: [Application Process] - 10 minutes

[Can you explain to me in your own words the process when you applied for health care benefits?]

> It was so long ago, I think it was an application, I am not 100%
> I am also sure it was not online, I went to the VA and they helped me

[What resources did you use to understand what health care benefits you might qualify for during this process?]
> The personell that was there in general
> Honest, it was probably 9-10 years ago
> I don't even know if reserources exited online at that point
> They would give me {list of paper resources}


[How would you describe the process that happened after you completed your application, such as things you had to do, additional information you had to provide, communications from the VA, your first appointment, etc.?]
> I do recall getting letters, seem to be expired.
> They would sent me a letter that was sent a month ago
> My first appointment was scheduled for me, by the time I got the letter the appointment had passed anyway
> I had to reach out and reschedule
> (note going to school, get quote from recording)

[Now that you have been using your benefits, I would like you to think back and recall if there is anything that would have been helpful for you to know during your application process that you have learned after you enrolled?]
> probably everything
> You kind of roll into
> The pamplets were very very umbrella, not very specific
> If you need this, call this number, then you are on hold for 2 hours

[How have you - if at all - been notified since you enrolled that you had to provide updated information?]

> I don't know if I had to ever provide
> If your address, kiosk check in,
> My address, insurance and next of kin maybe, I can't remember



### Things to watch for:
- [What terminology does the Veteran use as they talk about their experience?]
      - 
- [How does the Veteran portray the overall process - easy, difficult, uneventful?]
      - 
- [How does the Veteran describe the process of figuring out what they are eligible for - are they frustrated or do they find it easy?]
      - 
- [What does the Veteran call out about the process after the initial application and around managing their benefits?]
      - 
- [What pain points or areas of confusion are revealed?]


## Second Topic: [Priority Group - Awareness] - 5 minutes
[Can you tell me more about what Priority Group you are in for your health care benefits now?]

> One I believe
> I know it is the highest priority


[If aware of Priority Groups]
[Can you please describe how this was communicated to you and how you understood the impact to you and your benefits?]

> My understanding is based on disability, the severity of your disabilities, is where you fall into Priority Groups

> How relevant it is? Maybe once or twice
> How relevant that is to my health care
>






### Things to watch for:
- [Do Veterans' confidently know their Priority Group and what that means to them and their benefits?]
- [What is the current process and experience around Priority Groups?]
- [What are the knowledge gaps around Priority Groups and health care costs?]
- [What things would Veterans like to see or like to change in regards to Priority Groups?]

## Third Topic: [Priority Group - Future State] - 5 minutes
[Where are some places that you would like to be able to view your Priority Group number? Why?]

> A lot of use use MyHealtheVet or 

[How would this be a benefit to you?]

> Again if it is relevant to my health, who needs to know or who asked me,
> Not sure how important it really is.

[What type of information is important to you to have access to about your Priority Group and your health care benefits?]

> I guess maybe Profile, your name your info, like right below it or inline wiht it.
> There is so many information and resources on these websites it becomes convoluted. 

[Is there anything you find confusing about how your Priority Group impacts you today that you wish the VA would provide more clarity on?]

> Finding out exactly what a Priority Number is, why it is relevant, and how it affects my health care


### Things to watch for:
- [Do Veterans call out VA.gov as where they would expect to find this information? Do they list VA Profile?]
- [Do Veterans mention other channels to find and manage this information - Profile, MHV, mobile, etc?]
- [What information do Veterans want to know about their Priority Group?]


---

## Fourth Topic: [Updates post enrollment] - 5 minutes
[Changing directions a bit now, since you enrolled, have you had to make any updates to your information since your initial application?]

> So, another thing I recall them asking is updates on insurance.
> When I check in for appointmetns, there is a kiosk.
> You check in to your appointmetn, I know it is insurance, phone number and addresss
> ..... Anything else I have gotten a letter about or anything like that. 

- If yes:
   - Can you please tell me more about that. What did you have to update and how was that experience for you?
> Pretty easy, it is a self serve kiosk.
> 
   - How were you notified or how did you find out you needed to supply that updated information?
   - Is there anything about that experience that you wish you could change?
    > no not really. 30 seconds and you are done. Don't have to login to a site and forget my password or any of that.

     
   - Did you have to make updates for other benefits too or just health care?


## [Financial Disclosure] - 5 minutes
[How would you see a change in income impacting your health care benefits?]
> Significantly
> The VA is not my first line of defence when it comes to my medical
> It is private
> I was layed off, ...(get quotes from video)
> 

[How would you want to be notified to provide your updated financial information?]
> An email, would be best. Consistently VA letters are really behind for some reason.
> An email where I could click a link, direct me to home page, sign in and then complete


## [Dependents] - 5 minutes
[Have you ever had a need to make changes to your dependents for VA benefits? If so, can you tell me more about that experience.] 
> Yes, I just recently did it last December.
> I was very shocked at how easy it was. Went to a page, added information, a month later got an email that it was approved and had been updated. 



[Ideally if you had to make changes to your dependents, can you explain to me how you would go about doing that?]
> Only difference, I was married in the past and that individual was never my dependent. They asked me a lot of questions about my previous marriage....
> If you have that information, it is like a 5 minute thing

(check recording)


### Things to watch for:
- [What is the current process and pain points when making updates to post enrollment?]
- [What type of information is mentioned as what has been or they could see being updated?]



## Fifth Topic: [EZR Tasks - SCENARIO] - 10 minutes

**[Notification and process]**
[How would you like to receive this communication that you need to provide updated financial information?]
> For me would just be email
> Honestly, text would be ideal, but that would be in a perfect world
> Go to VA.gov and update your ...

[What would you want to know in this communication about how and why you need to update your financial information?]

> I like, straight to the point. VA is needing you to update your info for ABC and go there and update ther.
> I don't have a copay, don't think I have ever been asked to update my financials.
> I have never been asked this before, so why?
> {confirm quotes in recording)

> No specific reason, I just assume it would be under my profile.
> Everything I go to my profile, even banking, to update something like that.

> After I clicked on Profile, direct deposit that is money related right, another time that would say Financials, Income something like that
> The basic info is all here
> I don't know , income verification, break it down Barney style.
> Income, Financials


[income seen near, context]
> Like if I clicked on income tab, what I would expect to see?
> Very similar to banking, where you currently work, how much you make per year.
> I know you said copays, I have never had a copay, context to why you would need that
> Why would you need to know how much money I make,
> For increasing credit card limits, bank example, some context like that


### Things to watch for:
- [Where does the Veteran initially think to go to access this information? Do they validate hypothesis and go to their profile or do they look in other places to update this information?]
- [How does the Veteran expect to find this information from the home page or do they mention notifications or other paths as preferred ways to make these updates?]
- [How does the Veteran want to be communicated to and aware of what they need to do in regards to annual income updates?]

## Post-Task Interview - 2 minutes

[Is there anything else you would like to add about what we talked about today?]
> Mumbo jumbo and then you call the number to get more informaiton
> Very basic informaiton, you call the agent and they say this is so new wait and call back in 6 months
> Not place resources until people are trained or info solifified
> Calling the VA and being on hold is a whole level of anger and anxiety
> I am not really sure, we just have a script I am reading off of
[Any questions for me?]
