## P6 

--- 
  
## Warm-up Questions  - 3 minutes

Letâ€™s start with a couple warm-up questions.

- How long have you been enrolled in and using health care benefits from the VA?
    - *Roughly 6 years, last 4 is when I got put on 100% (August 2019).*
- How often do you visit VA.gov online and do you sign in every time you visit?
   - *Yes, sign in. A couple times a month.*  

## First Topic: [Application Process] - 10 minutes

- Can you explain to me in your own words the process when you applied for health care benefits?
   - *VA offices/facilities and workers there assisted*   
- [If they don't specify] Did you apply online, in-person or via paper application by yourself?
     - *Paper form.*
- What resources did you use to understand what health care benefits you might qualify for during this process?
   - *Worker guided the Veteran through the whole process.*
   - *Did not use the VA.gov prior to application because P6 did not Veteran did not know.*
- How would you describe the process that happened after you completed your application, such as things you had to do, additional information you had to provide, communications from the VA, your first appointment, etc.?
   - *Smooth process with a bit of a wait. It is the Government.*
   - *Communication would be cut and dry. The VA didn't need much more than that.*
- Now that you have been using your benefits, I would like you to think back and recall if there is anything that would have been helpful for you to know during your application process that you have learned after you enrolled?
   - *Didn't find out about Travel Benefits until a few years in.*
   - *Found out benefits during an appointment. Felt lucky to run into helpful workers*
- How have you - if at all - been notified since you enrolled that you had to provide updated information?
   - *"I haven't"*
   - *Veteran mentioned he moved a few times and had to update his address*

### Things to watch for:
- [What terminology does the Veteran use as they talk about their experience?]
- [How does the Veteran portray the overall process - easy, difficult, uneventful?]
- [How does the Veteran describe the process of figuring out what they are eligible for - are they frustrated or do they find it easy?]
- [What does the Veteran call out about the process after the initial application and around managing their benefits?]
- [What pain points or areas of confusion are revealed?]


## Second Topic: [Priority Group - Awareness] - 5 minutes
- Can you tell me more about what Priority Group you are in for your health care benefits now?
   - *"I am not sure". He has heard of the term but it has been a while."*
   - *"I am 100%", refers to his disability rating.*
   - *What do you think they are? "Based on service connected to disability. THe more percentage you are, the higher the percentage".*
   - *How do you think that affects your benefits? "I don't know".*

[If aware of Priority Groups]
- Can you please describe how this was communicated to you and how you understood the impact to you and your benefits?
- Before you completed enrollment, how were you aware of Priority Groups or copays as part of the health care benefits package?
- [if yes] Can you tell me more about what you knew before you applied and how you learned that information?
- Since you have been using your benefits, what have you learned about Priority Groups and the impact it has on you and health care benefits that you wish you knew during the application?

[If NOT aware of Priority Groups, ask question and skip to fourth topic]
- What do you think Priority Groups are? There is no right or wrong answer here, just explain your understanding of what you think it could be and how that is important to health care benefits. 




### Things to watch for:
- [Do Veterans' confidently know their Priority Group and what that means to them and their benefits?]
- [What is the current process and experience around Priority Groups?]
- [What are the knowledge gaps around Priority Groups and health care costs?]
- [What things would Veterans like to see or like to change in regards to Priority Groups?]

## Third Topic: [Priority Group - Future State] - 5 minutes
- Where are some places that you would like to be able to view your Priority Group number? Why?
   - *Had no reason to know it but have been told by the VA a few times.*
   - *If you had to know the number and need to know where it is, where would you like it? The Reward section is where the documents are.*
- How would this be a benefit to you?
- What type of information is important to you to have access to about your Priority Group and your health care benefits?
- Is there anything you find confusing about how your Priority Group impacts you today that you wish the VA would provide more clarity on?


### Things to watch for:
- [Do Veterans call out VA.gov as where they would expect to find this information? Do they list VA Profile?]
- [Do Veterans mention other channels to find and manage this information - Profile, MHV, mobile, etc?]
- [What information do Veterans want to know about their Priority Group?]

   - *Called the VA and they did it.*

   - Can you please tell me more about that. What did you have to update and how was that experience for you?
   - How were you notified or how did you find out you needed to supply that updated information?
   - Is there anything about that experience that you wish you could change?
   - Did you have to make updates for other benefits too or just health care?
     - *Nope, only updated the address.*


## [Financial Disclosure] - 5 minutes
