## P8

## Warm-up Questions  - 3 minutes

[- How long have you been enrolled in and using health care benefits from the VA?]
> Since August of 2020. 

[- How often do you visit VA.gov online and do you sign in every time you visit?]
> I do sign in every time as I visit. I am on it as often as I need to be. 
> It depends if I need to renew a prescription or schedule an appointment. A couple times a month.

---


## First Topic: [Application Process] - 10 minutes

[- Can you explain to me in your own words the process when you applied for health care benefits?]
> I went in to talk to my county VSO. He ended up helping me walk through the whole process.
> Then it was a process of getting papers together from my civilian doctors 
> All of my questions were answered, worked out really well working with the VSO
> If I hadn’t it would have been much more difficult.


[- What resources did you use to understand what health care benefits you might qualify for during this process?]
> I asked in person, did a lot of research online, so all of the above.

[- How would you describe the process that happened after you completed your application, such as things you had to do, additional information you had to provide, communications from the VA, your first appointment, etc.?]
> For me it was a really smooth process once I got into the system. I was able to get appointments made immediately. Worked with some very competent and caring providers.
> I don’t know if that process or same situation every one has. For me it was pretty smooth.

> It was mostly phone calls.

[- Now that you have been using your benefits, I would like you to think back and recall if there is anything that would have been helpful for you to know during your application process that you have learned after you enrolled?]

> You know really, just making sure I was keeping good records.
> The VA pulled what they needed from other sources.
> It seemed to go so smoothly, that again maybe not everyones experience. 
> Having the motivation to get everything submitted and get seen, that was the big thing.
> I waited a little while to start applying because I was intimidated by the process at first.
> Once I made the step to go to the VSO and then realized it wasn’t that bad.
> This process is not that hard, just a matter of talking to the right person.

> Probably my bad, skipped all the classes with the transition person.

> Having that knowledge would have made it even better. 

[- How have you - if at all - been notified since you enrolled that you had to provide updated information?]
> It’s been through physical mail. 
> Probably phone calls too, the ones that stand out is the physical mail.


### Things to watch for:
- [What terminology does the Veteran use as they talk about their experience?]
    - process, phone calls, talking to the right person, 
- [How does the Veteran portray the overall process - easy, difficult, uneventful?]
    - Smoothly and easy   
- [How does the Veteran describe the process of figuring out what they are eligible for - are they frustrated or do they find it easy?]
    - Asked in person and a lot of research online
- [What does the Veteran call out about the process after the initial application and around managing their benefits?]
    - Smooth  
- [What pain points or areas of confusion are revealed?]
    - Motivation to start, submit documents to be seen

## Second Topic: [Priority Group - Awareness] - 5 minutes
- Can you tell me more about what Priority Group you are in for your health care benefits now?
> I have no idea what Priority Group I am in
> I know I have a disability rating but no clue about group

[If NOT aware of Priority Groups, ask question and skip to fourth topic]
- What do you think Priority Groups are? There is no right or wrong answer here, just explain your understanding of what you think it could be and how that is important to health care benefits. 

[Disability Rating Questions]
> I can see it on the app which is awesome because it is really easy.
> Before I had the app, being able to find it online was great
> I was able to see it before I got the letter, a huge relief and 
> This is proof that the army screwed me up, being able to find it online and on the app too
> It is under my benefits (app) the bottom part of the screen
> Home benefits payments 
> First thing it says is disability rating

> Being able to see it instead of just hearing it
> You don’t always believe things you only hear, makes seeing them to make them real


### Things to watch for:
- [Do Veterans' confidently know their Priority Group and what that means to them and their benefits?]
    - No but was aware of disability rating and appreciated that being in the mobile app
- [What is the current process and experience around Priority Groups?]
- [What are the knowledge gaps around Priority Groups and health care costs?]
    - Not aware, awareness of disabilty rating
- [What things would Veterans like to see or like to change in regards to Priority Groups?]
    - See it not just hear it once

## Fourth Topic: [Updates post enrollment] - 5 minutes
[- Changing directions a bit now, since you enrolled, have you had to make any updates to your information since your initial application?]
> Yep
  
- If yes:

 > So I have had to update my address, number of dependents and completely change VA health care systems

> Most of it I just kind of assumed I needed to, so I did
> I wish the VAs would talk to each other more
>  It was kind of a pain in the butt when I switched from one to another
> Why can’t I have communication - why can’t they talk to each other instead of having to resubmit paperwork, that was annoying

> For my disability, I needed to submit the dependent information, but it was super easy. Just fill out a form and send something out online

> Having the stuff online is incredible because it makes it so easy for you to do yourself.



## [Financial Disclosure] - 5 minutes
[- How would you see a change in income impacting your health care benefits?]
> Considering I can get all of my care through the VA, not really, not really super impactful
> It would be… so a change in income or primary health insurance would not allow me to go to my civilian provider as easily. It wouldn’t make that huge of an impact, with I am now where I currently live. A 15 minute drive from a VA facility.

[- How would you want to be notified to provide your updated financial information?]
> Probably mail, a push notification through the app would be nice too I don’t always tend to open my mail right away but will see a push notification right away


## [Dependents] - 5 minutes
[- Have you ever had a need to make changes to your dependents for VA benefits? If so, can you tell me more about that experience.] 
> Again, it was really easy. I went to the website, don’t remember where, went to the website and entered my son’s information in and bam it was on.



### Things to watch for:
- [What is the current process and pain points when making updates to post enrollment?]
    - Call out this was for disability benefits, not health care (dependents) 
- [What type of information is mentioned as what has been or they could see being updated?]
    - Dependents

## Fifth Topic: [EZR Tasks - SCENARIO] - 10 minutes


[Notification and process]
[- How would you like to receive this communication that you need to provide updated financial information?]
> That would be easier via email.
> Because then I can just do it from a link.
> An email with a link inside (yep)

[- What would you want to know in this communication about how and why you need to update your financial information?]
> Well again, why do I need to update, how do I do it.


[Where to find]
> Probably, the top pages part. (Blue box on right side of home page) That would be super simple to have it in there.
> So, you have the sign in, the top pages. And having it there, that would make it very easy.

> Looking at this, just having a section somewhere to update it
> I am not sure where exactly
> To make it as user friendly as possible, I am quite certain there are a number of Vets who are not on the computer as often as I am, Making it very easily accessible would be the best thing.

> We have… having a section for updating information. I am going to click on the Profile thing real quick.

> Maybe it is under the profile, I haven’t explored this a whole lot. Under this part where is is profile (reading) maybe in there somewhere.

> I think it would, if there is a financial information part. 

> Something simple like financial information or financial update. 

[BACK ON HOME PAGE]

    - Home page was mentioned as the primary place to find link
- [How does the Veteran want to be communicated to and aware of what they need to do in regards to annual income updates?]
    - Email with a link, content what to do and why
