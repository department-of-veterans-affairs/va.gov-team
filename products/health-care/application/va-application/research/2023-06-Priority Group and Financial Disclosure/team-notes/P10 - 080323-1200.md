## P10 

[From Slack feedback-backchannel]
That was an interesting session! Some quick observations:
- Despite not having a service connected disability, seemed less aware/concerned with priority groups.
- Used VA.gov proactively to message providers and update info.
- Wanted priority group info in the profile.
- Wanted financial info on the My VA screen (first one after logging in).

*Start recording.*

[- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?]
    - *P10: Yes.*
[- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners, if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?**]
   - *P10: Yes.*

  
## Warm-up Questions  - 3 minutes

[- How long have you been enrolled in and using health care benefits from the VA?]
  - *P10: About 5 years.* 
[- How often do you visit VA.gov online and do you sign in every time you visit?]
  - *P10: Once or twice a week. Refill prescriptions and check appointment. Sign in every time. Uses both MHV and VA.gov.*
  

## First Topic: [Application Process] - 10 minutes

[- Can you explain to me in your own words the process when you applied for health care benefits?]
   - *P10: On-site originally and uses the paper form. Did the application myself.*
[- What resources did you use to understand what health care benefits you might qualify for during this process?]
   - *P10: Word of mouth from other Veterans.*
[- How would you describe the process that happened after you completed your application, such as things you had to do, additional information you had to provide, communications from the VA, your first appointment, etc.?]
   - *P10: worked in communication and is very tech savvy. The VA is very prompt with email response so participant prefers emails.*
[- Now that you have been using your benefits, I would like you to think back and recall if there is anything that would have been helpful for you to know during your application process that you have learned after you enrolled?]
   - *P10: Find out more about the claiming process and checking for updates, checking copays.* 

[- How have you - if at all - been notified since you enrolled that you had to provide updated information?]
- *P10 is proactive instead of receiving communication, receiving medication is important.*
> I am always proactive when it comes to things like that. I just recently moved, where I was getting my prescriptions in the mail it went to my old address. Due my due diligence and go in there and change my permeant address. so I had to contact them to let them know that I had moved so I can get my medications to my correct address along with my cell phone information. Yeah, after covid I ran into health issues so I want to make sure I stay up on my medication.


### Things to watch for:
- [What terminology does the Veteran use as they talk about their experience?]
- [How does the Veteran portray the overall process - easy, difficult, uneventful?]
- [How does the Veteran describe the process of figuring out what they are eligible for - are they frustrated or do they find it easy?]
- [What does the Veteran call out about the process after the initial application and around managing their benefits?]
- [What pain points or areas of confusion are revealed?]


## Second Topic: [Priority Group - Awareness] - 5 minutes
[- Can you tell me more about what Priority Group you are in for your health care benefits now?]
- *P10: Not service connected. I assumed I'm 2.*
> I am not service connected. I applied for a few things, but I have got turned down. It was back in the 80s when I enlisted so you know that you have to dot your I’s and cross your t’s. Make it fit when I have sleep apnea. It was hared to make that fit with my service time. If was just the matter of going through the process. Even with the tinnitus, they sent me to hearing, but I was turned down for that as well I have been turned down but there is always an appeal process.
> If I am not mistaken, I think I am 2.
> I don’t know what that is based on. Service connected is probably a 1. I am assuming it is 2 as far as I know. Everyone else 2, maybe dependents or whatever. 

[If aware of Priority Groups]
- Can you please describe how this was communicated to you and how you understood the impact to you and your benefits?
   - *P10: I was not.*



### Things to watch for:
- [Do Veterans' confidently know their Priority Group and what that means to them and their benefits?]
    - Unsure, was aware of a couple numbers and 1 being service connected
- [What is the current process and experience around Priority Groups?]
    - Confusion, guessing
- [What are the knowledge gaps around Priority Groups and health care costs?]
    - service connected
- [What things would Veterans like to see or like to change in regards to Priority Groups?]

---

## Third Topic: [Priority Group - Future State] - 5 minutes
[- Where are some places that you would like to be able to view your Priority Group number? Why?]
   - *P10: When you first sign into VA.gov under your Profile.*
   > I think when you first sign in on VA.gov and under your profile would be a good place to find out what priority group you are in and what that means for you and your benefits. What certain things might be available under your priority group. A lot of things are word of mouth. (Ramps and help to build), showers, things I never knew about)
   - If you are service connected, you were able to get more money than if you weren’t service connected.

[- How would this be helpful to you?]
   - *P10: Information on whether you can or cannot apply for.*
   > That way you will know. Say for instance dental, if you are not service connected and it says you have to be priority 1 to apply for dental services so if you are Priority 2 for you to receive it you wouldn’t waste your time trying if you don’t qualify you are not Priority 1.
   > What you can and cannot apply for. Time is of the essence and you don’t want to waste time if you wouldn’t meet the criteria to receive it.

[- Is there anything you find confusing about how your Priority Group impacts you today that you wish the VA would provide more clarity on?]
   - *P10: No, I like to research on the VA.gov. I found that the VA.gov to be a user friendly site.*


### Things to watch for:
- [Do Veterans call out VA.gov as where they would expect to find this information? Do they list VA Profile?]
- [Do Veterans mention other channels to find and manage this information - Profile, MHV, mobile, etc?]
- [What information do Veterans want to know about their Priority Group?]


---

## Fourth Topic: [Updates post enrollment] - 5 minutes
[- Changing directions a bit now, since you enrolled, have you had to make any updates to your information since your initial application?]
   - *P10: Beneficiary and address update.*
   > Yeah, I had my mom listed as my beneficiary, but she passed so I had to change that.
   > I also recently moved so I had to update that as well. That is pretty much it. I did I on my own.


If yes:
- Can you please tell me more about that. What did you have to update and how was that experience for you?
      - *P10, Mom passed away and moving.*
- How were you notified or how did you find out you needed to supply that updated information?
      - *P10 is provative in keeping their information updated.*
- Did you have to make updates for other benefits too or just health care?
      - *P10: Just mostly healthcare.*
    - Just my healthcare benefits.



## [Financial Disclosure] - 5 minutes
- How would you see a change in income impacting your health care benefits?
   - *P10: It could potentially impact.*
   > Well like I said, often times I have had some transportation issues where they had to pick me up and take my to my local VA facility.
   > You have to fill out a GAINS Report, I think it is called,  to show what type of income you make and the number of  people living in your house. Basically have to be dependents
   > It takes in the effect of medical expenses and  student loans to determine if you have to pay a copay or allowed to get the travel benefits or whatever. That is something I try to keep up with.

- Do you think income could impact you? 
> Yeah, if you have to apply for medicaid or go out into the civilian world and try and get help if needed.
 
- How would you want to be notified to provide your updated financial information?
   - *P10: Prefer the email method.*


## [Dependents] - 5 minutes
- Have you ever had a need to make changes to your dependents for VA benefits? If so, can you tell me more about that experience.
   - *P10 wasroactive in keeping information updated just in case anything happens.*
   > A lot of times some of the information may not be up to date. I got two daughters and neither one of them live with me, so trying to keep their addresses up to par, and also press them for their social. And not everybody likes to give their social, even your kids. Trying to get that information so less of a problem if something does happen.

- Ideally if you had to make changes to your dependents, can you explain to me how you would go about doing that?
   - *P10: I went to VA.gov.*
   > Do you recall where you went to do that? I went to VA.gov through MyHealtheVet because I was engaged but we split up and I had to take her off. 



### Things to watch for:
- [What is the current process and pain points when making updates to post enrollment?]
    - Proactively updated or initiated when things changed

- [What type of information is mentioned as what has been or they could see being updated?]
    - Annual income, address, beneficiary/next of kin


## Fifth Topic: [EZR Tasks - SCENARIO] - 10 minutes


[Notification and process]
- How would you like to receive this communication that you need to provide updated financial information?
   - *P10: Email.*
- What would you want to know in this communication about how and why you need to update your financial information?
   - *P10: Not updating would mean no service. Inform the Veterans of the consequences.*
   > Just say for instance if it could tell me to update my information if it would be harmful to them providing my future services. Priority to get it done. Just let me know what could happen if I do not update that. Just let me know why it is important.

[when told to go to VA.gov instantly signs in as a first step without prompted]

[Where to find]
   - *P10: The main screen, it could be on this page (My VA).*
   - *P10: instead of seaching for it, it should be BOLD. And be labelled as 'Personal Income'.*
   - *P10 found that MHV to be more user friendly in terms of login since the other login requires more numbers and cases.*


[On My VA]

- Now, from the VA.gov home page, can you walk me through where you would expect to go to update your financial information? 
- [Scrolls up and down page]
> On the main screen where they have (claims, health care, outstanding debts, benefit payments if you could add something that says Update your finances. 
> If it could be on that page it would be helpful. 


- Can you explain to me why you went [here] to update your financial information?
> If you see something instead of having to search for it, especially if you could lose your benefits, it is something should be in bold and bring your attention to it. 
> there is a need for it to be upfront.


- What would you want it to be called? 
> Personal income or something of that nature. 



> One thing I will add is I always MHV I find all the other logins to be very consuming because you have be computer savvy, to meet so many requirements to create a password. I found MHV more user friendly in terms of logging in. 

- [Clicks on MHV in header]

> I know in the military a lot of things may be on a need-to-know information. Information in there of high security and you might need a more secure password, I understand that as well. There may be a reason why you may need to create a harder password so people can’t just hack you.

- Would you expect that to be anywhere else besides the first page when you log in? 
> I guess you can have it under the personal information. So you can update your income.

[IN MHV]
[Goes to Personal Information >
