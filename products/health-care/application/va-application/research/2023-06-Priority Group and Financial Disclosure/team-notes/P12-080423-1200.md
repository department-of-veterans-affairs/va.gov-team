[From Slack feedback-backchannel]
**Some quick observations:**
- Recent applicant of healthcare benefits, but hasn’t used them that much.
- Was probably a registration-only Veteran since he applied while still in the National Guard and hadn’t retired yet.
- Pointed to the Profile for both Priority Group info and Financial updates.
- Was familiar with Priority Groups, but didn’t really know how they impacted benefits.


## Warm-up Questions  - 3 minutes

[How long have you been enrolled in and using health care benefits from the VA?]
  > I was still on active duty and needed glasses. 2019 maybe. 
  
[How often do you visit VA.gov online and do you sign in every time you visit?]
> I haven’t a whole lot the past few months. Was a lot when I was applying for benefits.
> Went frequently when checking the status.

 

## First Topic: [Application Process] - 10 minutes

[Can you explain to me in your own words the process when you applied for health care benefits?]
> For healthcare I made phone calls I didn’t go online for that, but for disability I did do that online. 
- Mostly went online for the disability compensation and 
- health care called
- Called the center, remember playing the phone tag name
- Full time Optometry, last ditch effort to get seen by somebody.
- 
> I have seen the health care profile and poked through that, to see what other benefits might ..

> Right now as a retiree doing alright going to civilian providers at the moment. 




[[If they don't specify] Did you apply online, in-person or via paper application by yourself?]



[What resources did you use to understand what health care benefits you might qualify for during this process?]

> on the 
> Friends to see what their experiences were like and what they qualified for for their situations.

[service, change of benefits]

> I honestly didn’t, did not give a lot of thought about. When I retired and got my rating they sent me a personalized book of

> I read it, I was curious.
> When you are in the transition, it is a strange place to be. A lot is changing. 
[booklet]
> Everyone has that input and noice and it was nice they tailored to me and my profile. 
> contact numbers and maybe it will be useful
> Having being seen for all the exams, the VA knows the status of my body and what not. 


[How would you describe the process that happened after you completed your application, such as things you had to do, additional information you had to provide, communications from the VA, your first appointment, etc.?]




[Now that you have been using your benefits, I would like you to think back and recall if there is anything that would have been helpful for you to know during your application process that you have learned after you enrolled?]
> Not particularly. After the deployments, a VA rep would visit and talk about enrolling, don’t know what that is like anymore, I found it lacking actionable information at the time
> what would have been helpful - the bottom line - what it means to enroll and why it is important
> As far as service related stuff, I am still 




[How have you - if at all - been notified since you enrolled that you had to provide updated information?]
> Not been contacted at all to provide that
