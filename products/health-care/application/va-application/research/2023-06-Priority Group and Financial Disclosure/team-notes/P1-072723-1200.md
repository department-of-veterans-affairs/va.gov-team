# Conversation Guide for health care application generative research study around Priority Groups and Financial Disclosure Updates [Health Enrollment Team, 10-10EZ, July 2023]

**Notes from DK**



  
## Warm-up Questions  - 3 minutes

Letâ€™s start with a couple warm-up questions.

- How long have you been enrolled in and using health care benefits from the VA?

Going on a year in Aug.

- How often do you visit VA.gov online and do you sign in every time you visit?
  
Three to eight times a month. Usually log in every time.

## First Topic: [Application Process] - 10 minutes

- Can you explain to me in your own words the process when you applied for health care benefits?

I thought it was pretty straightforward. Clear where to find the application and benefits. Mentions page with eligibility requirements. You have to answer questions about service history. "I'm tech savvy. I found it easy."

- [If they don't specify] Did you apply online, in-person or via paper application by yourself?

Applied online.

- What resources did you use to understand what health care benefits you might qualify for during this process?

I was more concerned on how to become eligible. Separated from active duty in 07. From reserves in 13. Mentioned "other pages for VA Health." "I poked around on all of the VA.gov site."

- How would you describe the process that happened after you completed your application, such as things you had to do, additional information you had to provide, communications from the VA, your first appointment, etc.?

"I think I got a conformation and that it would be evaluated." Mentioned getting this mixed up with disability. Thinks got sent a letter with status. I didn't need to provide any additional information. Remember being assigned to a dacility. All of that was new to me, so I didn't know about that. Facility was far away.

- Now that you have been using your benefits, I would like you to think back and recall if there is anything that would have been helpful for you to know during your application process that you have learned after you enrolled?

During the application, I had no idea how that differs from my insurance. I wasn't sure at the time what it was. Got info through the handbook later on. I wish I had known thew VA isn't an insurance carrier. "You can get benefits there. It's still confusing to me." Doesn't want to mix military/civilian life.

- How have you - if at all - been notified since you enrolled that you had to provide updated information?

Not that I know of. It's just contact information. Now logs on with ID.me. Not through eHealth any longer. Was prompted to to this. Maybe to conform the information. Don't remember anything in the mail.

### Things to watch for:
- [What terminology does the Veteran use as they talk about their experience?]
- [How does the Veteran portray the overall process - easy, difficult, uneventful?]
- [How does the Veteran describe the process of figuring out what they are eligible for - are they frustrated or do they find it easy?]
- [What does the Veteran call out about the process after the initial application and around managing their benefits?]
- [What pain points or areas of confusion are revealed?]


## Second Topic: [Priority Group - Awareness] - 5 minutes
- Can you tell me more about what Priority Group you are in for your health care benefits now?

Mentions her book. Doesn't remember the number. "That's the only place I think I saw priority level." Other than that, no one told me about it. It was a lot of self learning. I can't imagine a layperson doing this."

[If aware of Priority Groups]
- Can you please describe how this was communicated to you and how you understood the impact to you and your benefits?
- Before you completed enrollment, how were you aware of Priority Groups or copays as part of the health care benefits package?
- [if yes] Can you tell me more about what you knew before you applied and how you learned that information?

[If NOT aware of Priority Groups, ask question and skip to fourth topic]
- What do you think Priority Groups are? There is no right or wrong answer here, just explain your understanding of what you think it could be and how that is important to health care benefits. 




### Things to watch for:
- [Do Veterans' confidently know their Priority Group and what that means to them and their benefits?]
- [What is the current process and experience around Priority Groups?]
- [What are the knowledge gaps around Priority Groups and health care costs?]
- [What things would Veterans like to see or like to change in regards to Priority Groups?]

---

## Third Topic: [Priority Group - Future State] - 5 minutes
- Where are some places that you would like to be able to view your Priority Group number? Why?

Right on the main health page. Where you can communicate with doctors and disability level. I don't know if it's important enough to be in my face. Mentions maybe in the profile section. It might mention everything i need to get started.

- How would this be helpful to you?
- What type of information is important to you to have access to about your Priority Group and your health care benefits?

I haven't looked at the book in 10 months. I want to click on it and know what it means. Wants to know what you get with it.

- Is there anything you find confusing about how your Priority Group impacts you today that you wish the VA would provide more clarity on?


### Things to watch for:
- [Do Veterans call out VA.gov as where they would expect to find this information? Do they list VA Profile?]
- [Do Veterans mention other channels to find and manage this information - Profile, MHV, mobile, etc?]
- [What information do Veterans want to know about their Priority Group?]

## Fourth Topic: [Updates post enrollment] - 5 minutes
- Changing directions a bit now, since you enrolled, have you had to make any updates to your information since your initial application?

Had to submit name change. Ask what info? Hated name change process. Couldn't do it online. Had to call them and mail them a bunch of stuff. Had to send them a bunch of stuff. Didn't know where the process was at. Name changed and that was it. VA.gov and VA Health wasn't connecting. Would call and they couldn't change anything. Drove me nuts. Moved and had to change address when moved to Vegas. Had to change it in multiple places. Nervous about missing something.

- If yes:
   - Can you please tell me more about that. What did you have to update and how was that experience for you?
   - How were you notified or how did you find out you needed to supply that updated information?
   - Is there anything about that experience that you wish you could change?
   - Did you have to make updates for other benefits too or just health care?


## [Financial Disclosure] - 5 minutes
- How would you see a change in income impacting your health care benefits?

I hope not. As a Vet, we deserve the benefits. Regardless of how you're doing after, I think it's a right. I would hate it. I really like the VA Health benefits right now, and how I can do everything in one place. Moved three times in six years. Having this benefit should remain forever. People in poverty, it's okay if they don't pay.

- How would you want to be notified to provide your updated financial information?


## [Dependents] - 5 minutes
- Have you ever had a need to make changes to your dependents for VA benefits? If so, can you tell me more about that experience.

- Has two children. Haven't had to change there. They were born after service. Didn't add them. Didn't know she could add them. There's a lot of self learning. Someone she met told her she was qualified.

- Ideally if you had to make changes to your dependents, can you explain to me how you would go about doing that?


### Things to watch for:
- [What is the current process and pain points when making updates to post enrollment?]
- [What type of information is mentioned as what has been or they could see being updated?]



## Fifth Topic: [EZR Tasks - SCENARIO] - 10 minutes


[Notification and process]
[- How would you like to receive this communication that you need to provide updated financial information?]
- Online mail. Email or notification. I look for messages when I get an email about it.

[- What would you want to know in this communication about how and why you need to update your financial information?]

> How will I be affected if I go below a threshold.
- Wants to know all at once and not later.




[Where to find]

> So sho's asking me? VA or VA Health?
> I would sign in first, becuase to update anything need to sign in first.
> Directed to MY VA, instead of, kind of like a home page for VA. I just want to get straight to the point.
> Been clicking My VA just to get in, then a profile or communication

> A flag somewhere saying hey you need to read this
> What would be better, a banner saying we sent you a message to update and remind you.
> There are a lot of places to click.
- Goes to My VA first.
- Mentions it would be nice to have a banner as a reminder.

> I would want another tab here for financial information or something like that.

> I could think it is personal information, because it is
> The VA shouldn't care about my income, but..
> It doesn't fall under contact, not military, none of these it falls under
[Looking thorugh current menu options]
> That's why I am thinking it is personal. 

> I've never done it. I would to to my profile under My VA. I hate that departments don't talk to each other. I would go here first to update so that it applies to all the departments. I would want another tab here for financial information. It doesn't fall into the things here.



### Things to watch for:
- [Where does the Veteran initially think to go to access this information? Do they validate hypothesis and go to their profile or do they look in other places to update this information?]
- [How does the Veteran expect to find this information from the home page or do they mention notifications or other paths as preferred ways to make these updates?]
- [How does the Veteran want to be communicated to and aware of what they need to do in regards to annual income updates?]

## Post-Task Interview - 2 minutes

[- Is there anything else you would like to add about what we talked about today?]
> Hesitent to apply, I do like VA.gov gives you a lot more chances to try and see what benefits are available
> It's easier these days to find stuff and apply. As more people separate, they're more into online stuff. It would be good to get communications from them.
> I used to get a lot of emails like hey you might be qualified for VA health, but if seemed spammy 
> I like when they give you more chances to see what benefits are available. Would expect some Veterans to call or do things in person.
> Wants things in her face. Hard to dig around and find things.
