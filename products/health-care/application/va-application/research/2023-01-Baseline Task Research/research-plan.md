# [DRAFT] Research Plan for 10-10 Team, Health Care Application (10-10EZ), Baseline Tasks, January 2023

## Background
The Health Care Application (10-10EZ) enables Veterans to access and apply for VA health care easily with any device at any time, with or without assistance. Veterans can do this either as an unauthenticated user or as an authenticated user. This is an existing product and this research study will focusing on getting an overall baseline understanding of usability for key tasks. We will be focusing on the unauthenticated path using the staging environment for testing. 

- Product | [10-10EZ Product Outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/10-10EZ%20Health%20Care%20Application%20-%20Product%20Outline.md)


### OCTO Objectives 

The [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme) this research supports are:

**Increase**
- Usage of digital, self-service tools
- Percent of applications submitted online (vs. paper)

**Decrease**
- Time to successful complete and submit online transactions


### Veteran Journey
The health care application product fits into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) during the phases: 
- Getting out
- Starting up 
- Retiring 

Attending to health care needs during the starting up phase of the journey is a defined moment that matters, as is taking care of my health during the retiring phase. 


## Research Goals	
**1. Obtain a qualitative baseline for tasks within the application to use in comparrison with future studies and iterations.**

**2. Overall, what is easy or difficult to complete within the form and why.**

**3. Uncover pain point areas that cause confusion and need further discovery and research.**


### Outcome
We will use the results from this research to establish a baseline for comparrison in other research studies ([Household Section Optimization](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/192)) specific to key tasks that come up frequently during research sessions. 


### Research questions
- What tasks are consistently completed by participants with ease?
- What tasks do the majority of participants struggle with or have some level of difficulty?
- How successufl are participants in completing the household information section questions?

### Hypotheses
- The baseline study will help establish that the insights and pain points from previous studies are still consistently an issue with participants in this study. 
- The baseline study will show that there are areas of the form that most participants complete tasks easily (entering personal information or when going through short form flow) or areas that they consistently struggle (household information and insurance).
- The baseline study will show that the current household information section is a pain point due to the order of the questions and the content supplying additional context. 


## Method	
- Usability testing task analysis
- Post-task and post-testing participant questions


### Baseline Measurement
Determine a list of tasks and standardize how they are asked repeatedly from research session to session to begin measuring qualitative sentiment over time with design and content iterations. 


#### Post-Task Participant questions
- What worked well for you?
- What was unclear or didnâ€™t work well for you?
- What would you like to change or add?


#### Observer rating criteria
- 0 = No part of the task completed, much difficulty
- 1 = Partial completion, much overlooked or task was difficult 
- 2 = Partial completion, some areas were overlooked or task was slightly difficult
- 3 = Most of the task was completed with little difficulty
- 4 = All parts of the task were completed with no difficulty 

#### Post-Test NPS Question
- How likely are you to recommend this online application process to another Veteran? [Scale of 0 - 10]


### Location
Remote: Zoom

**Identity Assurance Levels**

- **IAL1:** Attributes, if any, are self-asserted or should be treated as self-asserted; there is no proofing process. (***Ex., User generated user name and pw***)

- **IAL2:** Either remote or in-person identity proofing is required using, at a minimum, the procedures given in NIST SP 800-63A. (***Ex., Id.me or Login.gov account***)

- **IAL3:** In-person or supervised-remote identity proofing is required. Identifying attributes must be verified through examination of physical documentation as described in NIST SP 800-63A.

## Screeener questions

- Are you currently eligible and receiving health care benefits from VA? {if yes, exclude from this study)
- Do you have a service connected disability rating of over 50%? {If yes, exclude from this study)
