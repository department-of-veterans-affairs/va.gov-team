## 10-10EZ Baseline study

### Pilot #1 - BE on CMS Sitewide team

- Looked at the “Start your application section” for the start button if you dont have an account
- If they had an account, would sign in “in case I needed to save and finish later”
     - Also be able to check status
     - They would create an account if they didnt have one
- Feels prepared = 5
- After screener, why am I being asked this stuff again?
- Born in Germany, so wasnt sure how to complete the place of birth question
     - If picked other, maybe another field would populate with countries?
     - Selecting ‘Other’ and “hoping for the best”
- Am Indian question 
     - “I like that there is a link for more information”
- Military info 
     - In National Guard, but it isnt listed.  So would choose ARMY in its place
     - Why don’t we have national guard?
- Dependents 
     - After continuing, would like to see a list of dependents before finally moving on from that section
- Income
     - Would be basing this off tax return, would have to go get that
     - Did indicate they would support their kids if they needed it, since they do not live with them.
     - “Kid’s income, that’s a tough one”  “Why is it asking me this”
     - “Would have to make some weird and uncomfortable phone calls right now”
- Deductible
     - Past year = last 12 months
     - Would go back to Income page and adjust the info
- Insurance
     - “On a card in my wallet, would be easy to enter”
- Facility
     - If i didnt see the city name in the facility name, i would probably Google the closest to me.

- Review page
     - Service History
          - Its weird seeing the list, when none were selected.
     - Upload
          - Didnt upload anything
          - Wouldnt know how to fix it because there is no link or button
          - Looks weird

- Confirmation page
     - Would have liked to print review page, or print form with answers on it
     - Looked to see if they could go back via button, link, or browser buttons

- Comments
     - There were some points that were confusing, even for them
     - Would not recommend having their mom do it on their own, would advise them to call or would assist them
     - Felt like the Income from dependents questions were weird and why it was asking
     - The pages after the screener are confusing and second-guessing

- Rating Preparedness = 4
     - Would like more clarification around what “Last Year” means (income)
