- (sign in) I am pretty sure I have to VA.gov to check benefits. 
- I also sign in to that ID.me, it alows you to sign in Veteran status, give discounts, a step ahead to filling in stuff. 
- (how often) Probably one every couple of weeks. The VA to tell you the truth, 
- I will sign in sometimes because they get my information wrong. because of the fact I was in a while ago, I wasn't just in 10 years ago. 
- Some of my paperwork lost in a fire, years and years ago. Before it was computerized. Hard for me to prove some things.

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

[NPS Question]
- How likely are you to recommend this online application to another Veteran? [Scale of 0 - 10]
- 10 , because it's easy. For me, it was really quick. And it gives you all the prep work on the first page, these are the things I need, and get them before you even start the application so you are not going back and forth. That is good.


- Thinking back on the question about the first page you saw and you rated it a [x on a scale of 1-5 (1 being non very poorly and 5 being very well)], would you keep or change that rating after going through this application? Why?
- 5, completely what you need
- Nothing is a surprise
- People need to be prepared
- The easier you make it for people, the more people will actually fill in the application.
- I know people who have started applications for things and it is too hard and they just give up... halfway thorugh I was confused.
- This is not like that at all, this is very clear, this is good. 


- Did any of the questions stand out to you as unnecessary?
- They were all necessary, definutley. 
- This last page, I would put learn more about what happens after you apply, I would put that up here.
- That doens't really stand out.
- The learn more about what happens link, I would put that before the questions part. 


- Did anything seem to be missing?
Um, no
- Like I said I was being picky, if they mean by educational expenses. Are you talking about, maybe explain that one a little more? 
- My book fees, by dependents tuition, what is all counted in there? That is the only thing I would clarify there.
-
