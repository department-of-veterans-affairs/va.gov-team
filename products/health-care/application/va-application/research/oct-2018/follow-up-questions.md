## Questions

These are the questions I have coming out of our initial calls with veterans:

### Post-application correspondence

* Are there differences with how paper applications and online applicatons are processed? 
* What about with the follow-up after a paper or online application is received?
  * What are people supposed to receive after they apply — Online, via mail, via phone?
* Do we know how many people are actually receiving the correspondence (eg. emails, letters, phone calls) they are supposed to be? Are there QA measures in place to measure how many people are successfully being reached?
* What are the differences with what people receive when they are accepted vs. when they are rejected?
* Is correspondence sent to the address someone applied with, or another address on record in the VA?

### Individual VAMCs

* Does all post-application correspondence come from each individual VAMC? Or is some of the correspondence coming from HEC, VACO, or another central point?
* When someone is accepted into VA healthcare, what kind of direction do they receive on how to set up an appointment or pick a doctor (could be a primary care provider or specialist depending on what they need)?
  * Some people are getting phone calls to set up an appointment — why? Is this something some VAMCs do?

### Duplicate Applications

* What does the enrollment system do when people reapply?
  * Does it register that this is another application for the same person?
  * Do people receive any kind of correspondence (or are they supposed to)?
* Once people are accepted into the VA healthcare system, can they ever be dropped for any reason (eg. change in income; they go a number of months or years without making an appointment)?
  * Is there ever a reason someone would need to reapply for VA healthcare (eg. someone receives VA healthcare, goes back to private healthcare, then want wants to come back to VA healthcare)?
* Can a veteran verify application status or enrollment in the VA healthcare system by calling the VA? If so, who would they have to talk to (eg. someone at their VAMC only, VA help desk, etc)?
