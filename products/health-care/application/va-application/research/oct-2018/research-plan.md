# Research Plan for interviews investigating duplicate HCA submissions

## Goals
**1. What product & team are you doing this research for?**

* Rainbows/Forms

**2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product?**


* Gabriel and Matt realized at some point that there was a significant enough number of duplicate HCA submissions to cause concern. Specifically, over 50% of HCAs are from Veterans who have previous records in the Enrollment System, meaning they applied in the past. They may be current patients, or may have been rejected previously.
* HCA stakeholders said that this was because people use the HCA to make changes to their information, predominantly address, income, and preferred facility. But, our team is skeptical of this hypothesis.
* We want to interview veterans who have submitted more than one HCA in order to determine why this is happening and figure out next steps.

**3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research?**

* Why are people submitting the HCA more than once?
* Do people remember submitting the HCA more than once?
* Do veterans think they need to submit another HCA to record changes in their address, income, or facility? If so, where did they get this idea?
* If they submitted a duplicate HCA for other reasons: where _would_ veterans go if they wanted to change their income, address, or preferred facility?
* Is there a single point of failure, or multiple different points of failure?
* Are there specific, clear improvements we can implement that would reduce the number of duplicate submissions? 
* What are our next steps?

**4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research?**

I have limited background knowledge on this topic, so these hypotheses are more general possibilities than anything based on specific research or existing insights.

* Change of address will have nothing to do with why people submit more than one HCA.
* Most people will not remember having submitted the healthcare application more than once, OR
* People will remember that they have submitted more than one application, and it will be because they never heard back about the first one.

## Method
**1.	What method of research are you planning?** 

Remote interviews.
  
**2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions?**

We can see on our end that veterans have submitted more than one HCA, but we are skeptical that they will even remember doing this. An interview allows us to have an open, unpredictable conversation and get to the bottom of things. We are afraid a survey would be too structured, and that it would be especially confusing if people don't remember applying more than once.

**3.	Where are you planning to do your research?**

GoToMeeting

**4.	What will you be testing?**

We will not be testing anything.

## Participants and Recruitment

**1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?**

We already have a pre-determined list of participants who have submitted the HCA more than once. We are looking for **ten participants** from this list, but we are not looking for any specific demographics beyond that.

**2.	What is your recruitment strategy?**

Brian from Perigean will recruit from the list mentioned above.

## When? 

**1.	Timeline: When are you hoping this research will happen?**

We are hoping to start interviews as soon as the week of **October 8, 2018**.

**2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready?**

The conversation guide will be prepared during the week of 10/1/18.

**3.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled?**

If participants are scheduled during the week of 10/8:

- 10/8: No interviews (federal holiday)
- 10/9: 8:00 – 5:00 PM ET
- 10/10: 8:00 – 5:00 PM ET
