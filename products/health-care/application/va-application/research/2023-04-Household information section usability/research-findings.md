## Research Goals
We wanted to:

1. Test the usability of the experimental pattern for adding multiple dependents to the household financial information section.
2. Determine if the there are any issues for assistive tech users when they add multiple dependents to the application.
3. Determine if the updated content for the household information section is clear and understandable or if any points of confusion remain.

## Research Questions
### Goal 1: Test the usability of the experimental pattern for adding multiple dependents to the household financial information section.
- When arriving at the dependent questions, is there any confusion on who the participant should add here? (Who does the VA consider a dependent?)
- Are any of the content/questions unclear or cause the participant to pause?
- Can participants easily move through the pages of dependent questions?
- Are the questions grouped by topic (one-thing-per-page) as it would make sense to the participant?
- After adding their first dependent, do participants know how to make changes or remove a dependent from the application?
- Do participants comment on the progress bar during this process?
- Are participants able to make adjustments to their dependents from the review page easily or do they struggle?
- Do participants seem to be confident when making edits on the review page or hesitant?
### Goal 2: Determine if the there are any issues for assistive tech users when they add multiple dependents to the application.
- Are there any accessibility issues when navigating through the multiple responses flow? 
- Is there any confusion with the tab order or how questions are presented?
- Do users struggle on the dependent 'review' page where it lists the first dependent added and the yes/no question to add additional dependents?
- Can users easily edit and make changes or is this process a pain point?
- Do users using screen magnification have any issues with the action button placement on the dependent cards or the confirmation modals?
- Does the progress bar or other form elements make it more challenging for assistive tech users?
- Can participants edit from the review page or does this present any challenges?
### Goal 3: Determine if the updated content for the household information section is clear and understandable or if any areas of confusion remain.
- Do participants seem to struggle or question any of the content revisions on the onboarding page?
- Do participants seem frustrated or appreciative of the extra pages with information (onboarding and documents needed)?
- Do participants interact with the additional info components to learn more? Which ones? Do they feel confident or confused after reading that information?
- Do participants find any questions difficult to understand or seem to need more information to answer?

## Methodology 
We conducted hour-long moderated usability tests on Zoom from August 14-August 21, 2023.

## Hypotheses and Conclusions
1. Participants will easily be able to add multiple dependents and move through the pages of questions.
   1. **Definitely True**: See primary finding number one.
2. Participants will appreciate the confirmation when destructive actions - such as remove or cancel - are initiated. (modals)
   1. **Definitely True**: See primary finding number one.
3. Participants will call out the edit flow for dependents as they have to go through all the pages and can't directly edit, would suggest they would appreciate a more direct route to edit.
   1. **Likely True**: One Veteran called this out.
4. The onboarding/documents page is well received as being clear and informational leading to a more positive perception about sharing this information.
   1. **Likely True**: Five out of seven Veterans rated the introduction page a five out of five.
5. The content helps the participant answer questions confidently and accurately.
   1. **Likely True**: Veterans didn't share any confusing parts of the application, instead focusing on how long things would take, both in filling out the application or getting results.

## Key Findings

### Primary Findings
1. Veterans were able to edit and remove dependents with relative ease using the new experimental pattern.
2. Finding dependents from review page can be a challenge.
3. Veterans take their time and are careful when completing form fields.
4. It's unclear to Veterans why they need to submit data that IRS later verifies.

### Secondary Findings
1. Veterans want transparency into lengthy, messy VA processes.
2. Login is still a frustration for Veterans who want the benefit of an authenticated experience.

## Details of Findings

**Veterans were able to edit and remove dependents with relative ease using the new experimental pattern.**

Participants seemed to have no trouble editing and removing dependents from their application, stating they found both the interaction with this new pattern to be clear and intuitive.

**Finding detail**
- All participants successfully edited dependents and removed dependents.

> P6: "There is no problem in editing any of it, don't see any difficulty in that"

**Finding dependents from review page can be a challenge.**

Some participants struggled with finding their dependents within the bulk of information on the Review page. Nearly every participant stated they would expand every section to review their submission, resulting in a large amount of content to search through.

**Finding detail**
- Five of the seven participants rated the page a 5 (out of 5) in terms of being prepared. The other two participants weren't asked the question.

> P1: "Actually really prepared You can review everything, double check entries, if you messed up you can edit it right there."

**Veterans take their time and are careful when completing form fields.**

Our Veteran participants mentioned want to get things correct, reading content cautiously and checking their work.

**Finding detail**
- Three out of seven participants cited wanting to be careful when filling out information or displayed careful behavior when reading through text and filling out form fields.

> P2: "You don't want to make a mistake on the forms."

**It's unclear to Veterans why they need to submit data that IRS later verifies.**

Several Veterans mentioned they know their income and household information will be verified by the IRS. Filling out this portion of the form that the IRS already has data on seemed unnecessary.

**Finding detail**
- Three out of seven participants mentioned how the VA should pull income data from the IRS.

> P4: "Ok, so you are going to ask me about all my financial information. But the note says you verify with the IRS, why do I need to provide it? If the VA is going to go to the IRS to verify my income and social security (it doesn't say that but I know they do) Why do I need to provide it?”

**Veterans want transparency into lengthy, messy VA processes.**

Participants mentioned wanted transparency around how long the application process might take, acknowledging that VA processes can take longer than expected.

**Finding detail**
- Five out of the seven participants made note of VA processes that lacked transparency or were challenging to get through. Three participants mentioned wanting a timeframe on the application on the confirmation screen after applying.

> P6: "Unless you know the VA system, you would not know that it's going to take forever."

**Login is still a frustration for Veterans who want the benefit of an authenticated experience.**

Some Veteran participants expressed frustration with the cumbersome login experience. The ability to login is valuable, allowing them to save their work and pre-fill information—this login tension dilutes their over VA.gov experience.

**Finding detail**
- Three out of seven Veterans understood that signing in meant that they could check the status of their application or save their progress. Others showed frustration with all the choices available to use for log on.

> P3: "The login process is *******ed. All of those entities are dumb as dumb can be."

## Recommendations

* Continue using and monitoring the usability of the experimental pattern for adding, editing, and removing dependents.
* Explore ways to lessen the burden of submitting information that the IRS has available already.
* Explore ways to make information more findable when it's in its expanded form on the review page.

## Next Steps

* Share findings with at the Design/Research Sync.
* Explore rolling out new dependent pattern to other areas of the 1010 EZ form.
