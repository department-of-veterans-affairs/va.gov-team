# Conversation Guide for [1010 Team, 10-10EZ, Household financial information section usability/UAT]

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners, if we remove any information that can be used to identify you? Oh sure. 

## Task: [Start Application] - 5 minutes

- For this session today, we are going to work through the scenario that you are interested in applying for VA health care. Please use your own information, except for your social security number. For that number, make one up. You'll be able to submit the application, but it won't be a real application, so it won't be processed by the VA. Also, in this case you won't log in with your VA user account.

- You arrive at [this page](https://staging.va.gov/health-care/apply/application/introduction). Please explain what the content on this page means to you and what you would do next: Um so the top part here is if I already have an account just click to login. The steps are self-explanatory. They tell you want you need and what you will get out of it.

**Participant questions:**
- On a scale of 1-5,how prepared does this page make you feel about the application you are about to begin? - Why did you give it that rating? I would say it’s a 5. 
- Can you tell us more about what you would have to do in preparation for filling out this application? Step two gather all of this information and make sure if this is the first time I look at it I need to go gather it either online or on paper so I know I have it. 
- What method/login would you use to sign in? How often do you sign in to VA.gov?


## Task: [Step 1: Veteran Information] - 5 minutes
- Could you please complete this section of the form and talk aloud about what you would need to do as you go: So far all of this is very easy. I haven’t found anything that’s hard. Why do they want my mothers maiden name. That really should have barring on me, maybe my maiden name but not my mothers. I like that questions, assigned gender at birth was how it was worded. I get it you have to ask that now. I used to make forms so. Let’s pick a good state, Opps I don’t know the zip code there. I guess it doesn’t matter. 

## Task: [Step 2: VA Benefits] - 3 minutes (skip/select no if time crunched)
- Continue completing the questions in the section of the form: Okay. I understand why its split between 40 percent and then 50 and higher. Before I got my va rating. I am service connected and over 50 percent. Before I got to 50, I had to pay a co-pay for anything that I wasn’t service connected for. Everything was paid for once I hit 50 percent besides dental because I am not 100 percent and no dental service connection. 


## Task: [Step 3: Military Service] - 2 minutes

- Continue completing the application and answer the fields about your military service information: None of these apply to me do you want me to click on just to see. 


## Task: [Step 3: Military Service / Upload Document] - 3 minutes (skip/select no if time crunched)

- Can you please explain the instructions on this page? SO they want me to upload my dd214. I see that they have the 256,57,and national guard form 22. So this means I would need to have a scanner or a phone that is connected to my computer. Once I get it then I just upload it and should be able to click continue.  I will say for the young vets coming out that wont be a problem but if you have a Vietnam vet doing it for the first-time it could be an issue because they will stop and not go any further. A lot of them don’t know, they barely get a call on their cellphone but there’s a lot of them that don’t use technology
Blocker for uploading the documents: yes that’s where the grandkids would need to come help if they even live near them. 
- Can you tell me more about what you would have to do to get this document and complete this task? No feedback provided


## Task: [Step 4: Household Information / Financial Disclosure] - 3 minutes

- Begin completing this section of the health care application. 
- Talk through what the content means to you and what you would do: So you will ask me about my financial information but the note states that they confirm my financial information with the IRS. Why do I need to provide it. If the va will go to the IRS to verify the income and SSI they didn’t say that but I know they do. Why would I need to provide it. I guess I should through a disclaimer out that I retired 2 years ago as a VSO so I can play the devils advocate easily. So now at this point I need to make sure I have my tax information so I can finish the rest of it. It could just be my computer but each time I click continue it doesn’t take me to the top and that can be a little frustrating. 



## Task: [Step 4: Household Information / Spouse Information] - 5 minutes
- Proceed with the application with answering the next question. 
- [If selected Married/Separated for Marital Status] Continue completing all the questions about your spouse and please remember to think aloud: I am making up a name. Oh interesting lets pick a good day here. 
Why is it interesting: all of a sudden it wants to know my marriage date but it makes sense since it is for my spouse. 
Again all of this can be gotten through the IRS. It looks like the online tax information. 

## Task: [Step 4: Household Information / Dependents / Experimental Pattern] - 5 minutes

- For this scenario, we would like you to answer as if you have 2 dependents.
- Please answer the questions on this page and proceed through that scenario. You can use fake information for fields like SSN and I can help prompt you with information if needed. 
Now I have to come up with more names. That is interesting when did they become your dependent. If I say its my daughter, oh okay. So I could have adopted them I guess. That could throw folks. What if that one had a yes or no before saying are they adopted. Well no I guess the stepchild to. That could be confusing or the dropdown up here you have stepdaughter and stepson. If one of those are adopted like adopted daughter or adopted son. Then it would popup when did they become adopted. Then you have grandparents having custody of their grandkids. That would open another can of worms though. Well since I made them older than 18 I should say yes. And yes. Now I  have to come up with another one. 
- [Once added the first dependent] Now can you add that second dependent.
- [Once both are added] Okay, now let's say you need to make changes to your first dependent - you need to correct their birthdate. Can you please walk me through how you would go about doing that? Sure it looks like it would be easy to click edit. Oh wait, what happened. I changed that to a 9. Oh so now I have to go through this again. I will leave that there. 
- Can you show me how you could take a dependent off of this application?  Just click on remove and that should do it. 


## Task: [Step 4: Household Information / Income and Deductibles] - 5 minutes

- Complete the questions asked on this page. Please talk aloud about the questions and information presented to you here: 
- [Continue clicked by participant and they answered married/separated] Complete your spouse's income information.
- In real life, how long would it take you to gather and make sure you were entering the correct information here? For me it wouldn’t be hard because I do our taxes online so its right there. In reality it would depend on who is filing it out. If she’s the veteran but she does the bills and financials she won’t know where it is without them vice versa. If my husband was doing this he would need to wait for me because he doesn’t remember. If I never dealt with the va I would need to look here because I don’t know what a non-reimbursable medical expense is. Nobody keeps receipts, they just don’t. Maybe if they pay with a card or check they can pull the bank statements to get that information. It would be work to get the receipts. One thing when I helped vets filing for pension if you don’t have a copy get a printout from the doctor. If its something the va considers reimbursable. For this one I will estimate I paid this, no ones going to college, and no one died. 


## Task: [Step 5: Insurance Information] - 3 minutes (skip/select no if time crunched)

- Please explain what this section of the form means to you as you work through answering the questions: normally this wouldn’t be a hard question but I don’t know if I want to be eligible or not. I will say yes for Medicaid. No not old enough yet. No that’s why I am trying to get the va. 


## Task: [Step 5: Insurance Information / Facilities] - 2 minutes (skip/select no if time crunched)
I thought the Affordable care act was not being enforced that you had to have insurance. 
What would you do to make sense of that question: if I didn’t have health care I would click it but some would leave it blank if they don’t think it’s a thing. There would be controversial  over this statement because penalties for not having healthcare was rescinded. You have veterans out there that see conspiracies and that could set someone off. That’s just form me using them. When I first started I had no clue. Oh it opens a new page; I can put in the city and state and see them. That answered that question. 
This could be a challenge here because what if I don’t know where the va centers are at. I happen to know where they are in NC, well where two of them are at.
- What are your impressions of what this page is asking for and why it is needed for this application? It was easy to fill out if I have insurance I would have the card so that shouldn’t be an issue. Everyone wants a piece of the pie so they will want my insurance to pay for it. That makes sense. I mean the va isn’t doing this without funds so they have to be able to pay their staff. 


## Task: [Step 6: Review] - 3 minutes

- Explain what you would do on this page and complete the application: So I would click all of the plus signs to see the information and go through to make sure it is all correct. I am still confused about the maiden name. Its nice that if there is a mistake I can click edit in that area to pull it back up. 
- Before submitting, let's say you wanted to review what you entered for your dependents and correct some information there. Can you walk me through how you would do that?  Okay. So let’s see. Okay let’s say I spelled the name wrong and I want to go back in this is easy to do it. Its just change that and it will let me change anything from the point I needed to change something onward. 

**Participant questions:**
- On a scale of 1-5,how prepared does this page make you feel to submit this application? Why? Oh definitely a 5. It is laid out well, it is self-explanatory if I made a mistake I can fit it. It looks like it is well laid out. 
- Is there any reason you wouldn't submit the application at this step? No if I was filing for the first time I would definitely select it. 


## Task: [Step 6: Confirmation] - 3 minutes

- What are your thoughts on this page now that you have submitted your application? Okay so if I don’t already have one of these accounts then I would need to get one because that’s the only way you can check it. Hopefully I would already have one. That right there is helpful. I will say the mail cannot be trusted these days. I noticed through the application an email wasn’t asked for, wait yes it was so maybe an email when they approve or deny it before it comes in the mail.
- What are your expectations of what is on this page and what would happen next? No there’s a phone number here I can call with questions as longas it’s not the benefits number that no one answers. 
Trouble with that before: Yeah just a little. Weve heard all of the complaints. I will say in two years I have not tried to call so they may have hired enough people to correct that. Everything on here looks, if I am a little computer savvy I can do this and if not I can call and someone will be able to help me with any issue I have. 
    

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

- How likely are you to recommend this online application to another Veteran? Oh definitely a 10. In fact if it’s out there I meet a lot of veterans in retirement I tell them to go online to see if there’s something there. Now I know if they need healthcare go online and fill it out and they’ll let you know. I spent almost 20 years not knowing I was eligible for va benefits because when I got off active duty I wasn’t offered a TAPS class. My command wasn’t that good and they didn’t offer information either. That’s what happened in the 90’s though. 
- Did any of the questions stand out to you as unnecessary? No not really just that one. 
- Did anything seem to be missing? Um I don’t believe so. Again this is just filing for healthcare not anything else. I think everything on there covered the questions.
- Any questions for me? No. 


## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

I want to circle back and re-confirm with you that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners. Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
If participant says yes: Is there any part of our discussion that you would NOT want shared in a video clip?

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again and enjoy the rest of your day!
