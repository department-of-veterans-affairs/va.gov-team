(ZoomText Screen Reader)
*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? Yes no problem at all. 
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners, if we remove any information that can be used to identify you? That shouldn’t bother me at all. 



## Task: [Start Application] - 5 minutes

- For this session today, we are going to work through the scenario that you are interested in applying for VA health care. Please use your own information, except for your social security number. For that number, make one up. You'll be able to submit the application, but it won't be a real application, so it won't be processed by the VA. Also, in this case you won't log in with your VA user account.

- You arrive at [this page](https://staging.va.gov/health-care/apply/application/introduction). Please explain what the content on this page means to you and what you would do next.

(Participant attempted to enable ZoomText but used Magnification instead)
Setting normally used: yes but for some reason I cant access ZZOM Text so I magnification it. As long as I have my glasses this will work. 
I would go to the upper corner and click sign in or this here near the bottom to sign in then start the application. 


**Participant questions:**
- On a scale of 1-5, how prepared does this page make you feel about the application you are about to begin? - Why did you give it that rating? Well what I see is how to apply for benefits with the linear instructions. I can see the print very well. I can understand the language and information required as an applicant. Visually impaired the color of the steps it starts to blend you know. Thats just me and my vision. I like the blue and grey contrast. The information is fine and its linear. Fonts are great. This area down here I would get fatigued with quick. It’s all congested. This line here together.  3, well it looks like I have multiple options do I start here or down here. I would end up going through all of this to second guess what I am trying to do which is start the application. 
- Can you tell us more about what you would have to do in preparation for filling out this application? I would be ready right away. 



## Task: [Step 1: Veteran Information] - 5 minutes
- Could you please complete this section of the form and talk aloud about what you would need to do as you go: As you can see here. And continue. I like this progression bar; it gives you an idea of how long will it actually take or if I am missing something. I like that. The information if I put it in correct a red box comes up so that lets me know I need to go back to there.  This could be in bold print to stand out. If the entry part was like this it would help out. I guess I am old school because I never had to answ3er that question before. I like this right here the required in red catches my attention. I guess I have used this a time or two before. 
Thoughts: I had to remember I entered my address so why am I entering another but I indicated that my mailing is different than my home address. I don’t think this is an application think this is just me using it over and over. A pre0f8ll function.  

Rating: About 50. 

## Task: [Step 2: VA Benefits] - 3 minutes (skip/select no if time crunched)
- Continue completing the questions in the section of the form: This is pretty easy here. I didn’t have my number lock on and that’s why I had to pause for a minute. That’s probably what the issue was for the zip code as well.  Yeah this bar lets me know I am about halfway through. 

## Task: [Step 3: Military Service] - 2 minutes

- Continue completing the application and answer the fields about your military service information: No feedback provided

## Task: [Step 3: Military Service / Upload Document] - 3 minutes (skip/select no if time crunched)

- Can you please explain the instructions on this page? It is asking me to upload my dd214. If you have more than one you upload just one. I would scan the item scanned to my computer than go to upload document and it asks me to attach it so I would locate it on the hard drive and click upload. 
- Can you tell me more about what you would have to do to get this document and complete this task?


## Task: [Step 4: Household Information / Financial Disclosure] - 3 minutes

- Begin completing this section of the health care application. 
- Talk through what the content means to you and what you would do: It is asking for the finances ii think of tax forms. (Reading page) I am reading to make sure I understand what is being asked because last time it was click and fill out but now it’s a lot of words. I have an understanding and I would move forward. That was a throw off since it loaded at the bottom of the screen. I used to teach computers back in the day.  If it is required I would probably do it.
How would you normally answer: I would do yes because I want the coverage so I would say yes. 
It is asking the type of information I would need to report. Again for preparation for me to have these documents ready to continue on. 
Time or effort for you: When I get these documents I scan and upload them to my hard drive. I would locate it on my other hard drive where they are and pull it up to have it ready. I would then go to the next page. Most of this information is form the va form they give you for health coverage and tax forms. I would have those ready. 


## Task: [Step 4: Household Information / Spouse Information] - 5 minutes
- Proceed with the application with answering the next question. 
- [If selected Married/Separated for Marital Status] Continue completing all the questions about your spouse and please remember to think aloud.  



## Task: [Step 4: Household Information / Dependents / Experimental Pattern] - 5 minutes

- For this scenario, we would like you to answer as if you have 2 dependents.
- Please answer the questions on this page and proceed through that scenario. You can use fake information for fields like SSN and I can help prompt you with information if needed. 

- [Once added the first dependent] Now can you add that second dependent: I would say yes, first thing that comes to mind are the tax forms and their ages. 
Tax forms would be your go to: yes that is probably the most thorough information to use. Then I would answer their relationship/SSN/DOB and all of that good stuff. 
It threw me off for DOB and time they became dependent but there are adopted kids and step kids. Then they have more information on him. Then this is where I would be prompted to add the second kid. I will make it interesting this time. I know this is repetitive form the first child. As this one is a stepchild I would definitely want to make sure it is correctly responded to. 
- [Once both are added] Okay, now let's say you need to make changes to your first dependent - you need to correct their birthdate. Can you please walk me through how you would go about doing that? For the first one I would click the edit button and click it. Then say I did put in the wrong number I would change it then click continue. This would be the same information as before but I would verify until I a back here. 
- Can you show me how you could take a dependent off of this application?  I would use the red tab or link to remove. I like that when you touch it, it moves the text box to alert you to pay attention. I would verify one more time and it really caught my attention. 




## Task: [Step 4: Household Information / Income and Deductibles] - 5 minutes

- Complete the questions asked on this page. Please talk aloud about the questions and information presented to you here: I would have my things pulled up here to look at. I would enter my income for the year here then move on down. More than likely I would be able to find that on my tax forms and put it in. Other income I would put a 0 and continue. 
Tax forms as well: yes. I really wouldn’t know this because I am blind and I do have expenses. 
Your own college throws me off since we just came from dependents so I would need to pay attention to the words used here. 
- [Continue clicked by participant and they answered married/separated] Complete your spouse's income information.
- In real life, how long would it take you to gather and make sure you were entering the correct information here?


## Task: [Step 5: Insurance Information] - 3 minutes (skip/select no if time crunched)

- Please explain what this section of the form means to you as you work through answering the questions.: Here it asks if you are eligible for Medicaid so yes. Enrolled in part a, me personally I would put yes. I would put Tricare. I would than put in my SSN since for Tricare the policy number is the ssn than go to next. 


## Task: [Step 5: Insurance Information / Facilities] - 2 minutes (skip/select no if time crunched)

- What are your impressions of what this page is asking for and why it is needed for this application?  I wouldn’t select this because I already have insurance. I already have the minimum coverage. Again with this here the font I would make it a little larger because you are switching gears a little bit because it is asking the location. It provides the option to find where you are. if you click this it tend to go to the USA map and you really have to locate where you are
Would it be helpful: I don’t want to click it but when I had my vision it was easy to use but now it is a little challenging. 
Why is it needed here: if I am signing up for healthcare it is the basic information needed and the best place to assign me to a facility. They will have most of this in there system by the time I go there but this is selecting where you want coverage. It seems like this is almost done. 
Do you know where you want to go: yes and most veterans do. 

## Task: [Step 6: Review] - 3 minutes

- Explain what you would do on this page and complete the application: I look at the progression line and I am at the end. I see all of the sections completed. I would click the plus to go through to make sure it is okay. I could do it with each one before submitting it at the end. Confirm everything then submit the application. 
- Before submitting, let's say you wanted to review what you entered for your dependents and correct some information there. Can you walk me through how you would do that?  I would find out which section they are in I think it is in household then find dependents. I would find the dependent and click edit. I verify its them then click edit again and find the DOB to update it, then go back to continue. I would need to go back and update the when did they become the dependent. I like the red because it tells you go to back to correct it. I would make sure nothing else nee4ds updated before submitting it. 

**Participant questions:**
- On a scale of 1-5, how prepared does this page make you feel to submit this application? Why?
- Is there any reason you wouldn't submit the application at this step?


## Task: [Step 6: Confirmation] - 3 minutes

- What are your thoughts on this page now that you have submitted your application? Feel good because there’s a green check. I feel application. Then this information to print I would select this to have proof of record . I would print but I would save it as a PDF> I would scroll down to make sure there’s nothing else so I would log off. 
- What are your expectations of what is on this page and what would happen next? I would save the printed information then go to the top to log off and close the browser. 
- Would you do anything on this page or pause before moving on?



## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

- How likely are you to recommend this online application to another Veteran? Absolutely. Definitely a 10. 
- Did any of the questions stand out to you as unnecessary? Everything was sufficient and I understood it all. 
- Did anything seem to be missing? All were sufficient. SSN, DOB, Name. Each question was sufficient. 
- Any questions for me? Uh no. I just hope you were able to comprehend everything I was saying. 


## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

I want to circle back and re-confirm with you that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners. Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
If participant says yes: Is there any part of our discussion that you would NOT want shared in a video clip?

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again and enjoy the rest of your day!
