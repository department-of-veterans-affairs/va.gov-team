# Conversation Guide for [1010 Team, 10-10EZ, Household financial information section usability/UAT]

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? Yeah. 
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners, if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?


## Task: [Start Application] - 5 minutes

- For this session today, we are going to work through the scenario that you are interested in applying for VA health care. Please use your own information, except for your social security number. For that number, make one up. You'll be able to submit the application, but it won't be a real application, so it won't be processed by the VA. Also, in this case you won't log in with your VA user account.

- You arrive at [this page](https://staging.va.gov/health-care/apply/application/introduction). Please explain what the content on this page means to you and what you would do next: (Reading Page) Eligibility is self-explanatory. It seems to me that it is self-explanatory. (Reading Page) I understand that. Okay.

**Participant questions:**
- On a scale of 1-5, how prepared does this page make you feel about the application you are about to begin? - Why did you give it that rating? Um if you are first starting this it seems a little overwhelming. Just because there is so much information you have to read. If you just started doing this it seems, yes they put 1,2,3 on here but unless you have a lot of time to gather all of this information to go through this before you start to gather the information it would seem overwhelming to someone. 
Time consuming to digest content and gather information: right. I understand that it only says it takes ab hour but it would take longer than an hour to gather the information and you have to look it up, get the papers together. Or if you are a spouse filing it for a husband/wife or significant other it would take quiet a bit of time. The hour they say to fill out the form is probably correct but the prep before filling out the form could be daunting. Youd have to go through this then (reading page) in my case I was discharged based on a service-connected disability but you would have to. It seems harder than it should be. 
1-5 rating: I would give it about a 3. 
- Can you tell us more about what you would have to do in preparation for filling out this application? Well I would gather all of the information then start the application. It explains if you sign in you can save the work, which is a good deal. 
Would you sing in: Yes in order to keep the information that I put in there so it doesn’t go away. They have to be, singing in would take about 30 minutes but yeah. 
- [If participant says they would sign in] What method/login would you use to sign in? How often do you sign in to VA.gov?



## Task: [Step 1: Veteran Information] - 5 minutes
- Could you please complete this section of the form and talk aloud about what you would need to do as you go: Now for the year would they want because they don’t specify if they want 4 or just 2. I will go ahead about put the four. Lets just make it prefer not to answer. 
Is that what you would typically use if you were filling it out: No I would put on there white but if I didn’t want to answer so I wouldn’t be. Let’s say I am mixed that would be other. 
You have to have a mobile phone, what if I don’t have one what would I do. 


## Task: [Step 2: VA Benefits] - 3 minutes (skip/select no if time crunched)
- Continue completing the questions in the section of the form.




## Task: [Step 3: Military Service] - 2 minutes

- Continue completing the application and answer the fields about your military service information: I made it less than 4 years for the simple fact that I was discharged for a disability. Honorable character, okay. Continue. (Reading Page) That’s what they said I was. 



## Task: [Step 3: Military Service / Upload Document] - 3 minutes (skip/select no if time crunched)

- Can you please explain the instructions on this page?  I am not going to upload, what happens if I don’t do that. 
- Can you tell me more about what you would have to do to get this document and complete this task?


## Task: [Step 4: Household Information / Financial Disclosure] - 3 minutes

- Begin completing this section of the health care application. 
- Talk through what the content means to you and what you would do: (Reading Page) Now on this section it is confusing to me. It says you may qualify for enhanced eligibility status if you received these benefited. I don’t have VA p3ension. A service connection compensation which I would have gotten at 10 percent at the time I filled this out. Medicaid I did not qualify for at that time. If I qualify for this because I would have claimed that income with the IRS. Then yes I would qualify for the enhanced whatever. Okay. 
What part confused you: I clicked on learned more about enhanced eligibility status. Because I could not upload the household information like in my tax form for 2022. Say I don’t have a scanner at home so how would I get that information to them that I was going to get the service-connected disability at the tax forms to them. Theres no explanation there. 
Let me hit continue. It asks if I want to share the information, so let me hit yes because I would want to in order to show I get money for that 10 percent. Okay so you would fill this information out on the form so they will take your word for it or they will check with the IRS to verify the information. Okay. Then I don’t need to make a copy because they have my SSN to check it with the IRS.  They can retrieve that from the IRS. That clarified that for me. Now I am back to apply for va healthcare (Reading Page) okay I would say I am married and click continue. 

## Task: [Step 4: Household Information / Spouse Information] - 5 minutes
- Proceed with the application with answering the next question. 
- [If selected Married/Separated for Marital Status] Continue completing all the questions about your spouse and please remember to think aloud: I’ll put my last husband.


## Task: [Step 4: Household Information / Dependents / Experimental Pattern] - 5 minutes

- For this scenario, we would like you to answer as if you have 2 dependents: 

- [Once added the first dependent] Now can you add that second dependent: the children don’t have disabilities right. (Reading age) I put yes, okay. Yes. No. Does this one also have a disability. Okay so I will answer, yes, yes they lived with me, no they didn’t earn income and continue. No other dependent. 
- [Once both are added] Okay, now let's say you need to make changes to your first dependent - you need to correct their birthdate. Can you please walk me through how you would go about doing that? Hit edit and it lets you go and change their middle name. hit backspace to erase and change it to joe and don’t want to change anything else. 
What about the DOB: To a different day, you will pick the 16 and you can change the next day to the 16 which would be when they came your dependent. That would all be changed and you would just confirm and hit continue. Then it goes back to the additional information if they lived with you, disabled, and if they earned income you can change then click continue and it should then be changed. Theres no issues with editing it. I don’t see any difficulty in that. 
- Can you show me how you could take a dependent off of this application? Hit remove. (Reading page) That is a yes or no. that is a simple thing. They have been removed. 


## Task: [Step 4: Household Information / Income and Deductibles] - 5 minutes

- Complete the questions asked on this page. Please talk aloud about the questions and information presented to you here.
- [Continue clicked by participant and they answered married/separated] Complete your spouse's income information.
(Reading page) it was before I got the va benefits so it would be able I don’t know let’s say 52K. Oh I don’t know. I have no idea what I should put there. So I got 10 percent from the va so that would probably be like 2400. 
- In real life, how long would it take you to gather and make sure you were entering the correct information here? I would get a copy of my tax form and this would be on there. This wouldn’t be a problem because I always keep the previous year tax form, I would just get it out. 
This would also come off of the tax form for medical expenses.

- Before submitting, let's say you wanted to review what you entered for your dependents and correct some information there. Can you walk me through how you would do that? 

**Participant questions:**
- On a scale of 1-5, how prepared does this page make you feel to submit this application? Why?

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

I want to circle back and re-confirm with you that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners. Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
If participant says yes: Is there any part of our discussion that you would NOT want shared in a video clip?

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again and enjoy the rest of your day!
