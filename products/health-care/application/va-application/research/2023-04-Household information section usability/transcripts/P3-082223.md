# Conversation Guide for [1010 Team, 10-10EZ, Household financial information section usability/UAT]

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? Yes
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners, if we remove any information that can be used to identify you? Of course. 


## Task: [Start Application] - 5 minutes

- For this session today, we are going to work through the scenario that you are interested in applying for VA health care. Please use your own information, except for your social security number. For that number, make one up. You'll be able to submit the application, but it won't be a real application, so it won't be processed by the VA. Also, in this case you won't log in with your VA user account.

- You arrive at [this page](https://staging.va.gov/health-care/apply/application/introduction). Please explain what the content on this page means to you and what you would do next: This is all reasonable it is laid out in a way I can understand.

**Participant questions:**
- On a scale of 1-5, how prepared does this page make you feel about the application you are about to begin? - Why did you give it that rating? 5. It is telling you want you need to do before to gather. Yeah it is all right here. A lot of times you will get into it then you need to know how many gerbils I and in my like time and you have to call your mom. How many met untimely ends. 
Appreciate knowing what is coming: yes no surprises in what’s coming up. 
- Can you tell us more about what you would have to do in preparation for filling out this application?
- What method/login would you use to sign in? How often do you sign in to VA.gov?


## Task: [Step 1: Veteran Information] - 5 minutes
- Could you please complete this section of the form and talk aloud about what you would need to do as you go: It started me at the bottom.
Thoughts:  I thought fuck that. That’s what I thought. They can recode that to pull to the top. Some people would get to this and go back and fourth then say there’s nothing there. Its just the way we are we will keep pushing on that pull door. 
Ahh it needed to be numbers for the social not letters. Its not taking the 333 things. It just didn’t buy into the 3 thing. Hmm, do we not have an other here  for assigned at birth
Would you expect that: Yes today but not 10 years ago. It relevant to the climate today. I mean I don’t understand a lot of and that’s one of the things I don’t understand. 


## Task: [Step 2: VA Benefits] - 3 minutes (skip/select no if time crunched)
- Continue completing the questions in the section of the form: So if this would be no as well. 

## Task: [Step 3: Military Service] - 2 minutes

- Continue completing the application and answer the fields about your military service information: anything there. 

## Task: [Step 3: Military Service / Upload Document] - 3 minutes (skip/select no if time crunched)

- Can you please explain the instructions on this page? Proof of service, POW status, Purple heart, Medal of honor. Winner is an odd word because you didn’t win anything. You don’t win a purple heart either I promise. Makes sense. 
- Can you tell me more about what you would have to do to get this document and complete this task? I would take a picture of it and upload the picture as a jpg. 


## Task: [Step 4: Household Information / Financial Disclosure] - 3 minutes

- Begin completing this section of the health care application. 
- Talk through what the content means to you and what you would do: Income based. Travel pay. Oh you guys need to get involved with travel pay it’s a nightmare. The BTSSS which I don’t know what it is but it is the travel system. Whoever hands that now is retard3ed but bless their hearts. Retire them and get you guys on it. What you guys do is coherent. I like working with you because you’re not smart dumbasses meaning that in the nicest way. It is a train wreck but that’s not your fault. I can see in the va system where your fingerprints are I see the handy work at different points. I mean fooling with you guys for 10 – 12 years. I sue to go to the location near Vanderbilt in Nashville. You guys did it as an extension to them. 

What would you do next if going forward: This is an excused for a certain percentage. I know what you are doing so do you need to know what I know or what I would be thinking as a person on the street. 
Does it make sense, any changes you’d make: No this is straight forward. Very straightforward. It isn’t fragmented and its not overly ponderous. This is what we need and would like you to provide. Its not authoritarian or condescending.
Why are we asking for this: it is just, with my situation everything is covered due to the rating. Ti doesn’t matter how. But there’s a razors edge in the program where there are benefits that are based on income factors. If you are 10 percent with a knee problem that’s not service connected you’ll have a co pay. I work with VSO’s ad help people figure this out. Every once in a while people have co-pays and it beats paying 1000 a month that covers nothing. 
Would you normally do that: Well if I had a strange growth on my neck or lost a finger or was pissing blood I would give you that financial information. You can absolutely run out of blood if it’s like that. I am on an emergency bases and this system people don’t understand how streamline or fast it is because we use to do it buy mail and if someone didn’t want to look at it someone would say no then have to send it again. This is like living in the future. I would give you all of that information. 

## Task: [Step 4: Household Information / Spouse Information] - 5 minutes
- Proceed with the application with answering the next question. 
- [If selected Married/Separated for Marital Status] Continue completing all the questions about your spouse and please remember to think aloud: Divorced 3 times I wonder why. You should ask the number of divorces. 

## Task: [Step 4: Household Information / Dependents / Experimental Pattern] - 5 minutes
We will pretend wife one is still the wife. 
- For this scenario, we would like you to answer as if you have 2 dependents.
- Please answer the questions on this page and proceed through that scenario. You can use fake information for fields like SSN and I can help prompt you with information if needed. 

- [Once added the first dependent] Now can you add that second dependent: Okay. 
- [Once both are added] Okay, now let's say you need to make changes to your first dependent - you need to correct their birthdate. Can you please walk me through how you would go about doing that? You’re not kidding. When she found out about the second dependent. 
- Can you show me how you could take a dependent off of this application? Just like it never happened. Always wear a helmet kids. 


## Task: [Step 4: Household Information / Income and Deductibles] - 5 minutes

- Complete the questions asked on this page. Please talk aloud about the questions and information presented to you here: okay. 
- [Continue clicked by participant and they answered married/separated] Complete your spouse's income information.
- In real life, how long would it take you to gather and make sure you were entering the correct information here? For ballpark accuracy, they are looking for the target of whatever median or poverty level figure. Based on the numbers I just put in is way over. I don’t think the accuracy is important because I am over the numbers. If I was in 16-32 ranges, well you should know about how much you make. If I was in the 50 range I would go get the information to be sure. People that don’t know they would plug in what they think is correct. 
IF making closer to the line you’d be more willing to double check: yes or f you were trying to make the base line or be under some people would try to make that work. They would force the issue but I don’t have to. With me the accuracy but then again I know what you are looking for but others can’t hid it because it will pull them over. I am not sure. Sometimes you blow the number by 1000 and can never reapply. It is depending on your desired outcome. I think people might go to the last year tax return to get the right number but you gave them a heads up., most would be doing this at home and not on the ap driving down the road. 


## Task: [Step 5: Insurance Information] - 3 minutes (skip/select no if time crunched)

- Please explain what this section of the form means to you as you work through answering the questions: I am covered by the va for everything and it’s for the purpose of ACA. My coverage with VA is considered to be qualifying insurance so that could be a curve ball but that’s how its worked and being ACA compliant so you aren’t hit with fines for not being covered. This is just saying form a spouse or someone else. That’s a little weird because they are here looking for coverage. So I guess somewhere here you may want to cover the coverage form va somewhere. I don’t know how that would be. 
This could be confusing because you are applying but asking about other coverage: yes. I am already in this system so. If someone was going through this and trying to get this but have what I have already. I don’t know how the diagram would work through it. 
Here is the Tricare thing and group code. I don’t know what all that is. I can go anywhere and show my va card. Then I call the VA and its taken care of. 


## Task: [Step 5: Insurance Information / Facilities] - 2 minutes (skip/select no if time crunched)
Theres our ACA thing.
- What are your impressions of what this page is asking for and why it is needed for this application? Just so the recipient of this application knows where they will be slotting them in. If you find out they are good you’d need to contact them to ask where they are. ill tell you something if anyone is in 100 miles of the York facility that’s where you want to go. Murphysboro has the best care for 300 miles in either direction. They feed to Vanderbilt. I’ve been with hem for 13 years and they are the best. I have been to a lot of different facilities and this is the flagship of the system. 
What are you looking for here: Alvin c York. Its not in alphabetical order. So many of things aren’t in any way system wide. On the travel it could take an hour to find it in the drop down and you are never sure if you did the right thing or not. Alphabetizing is hard. I have a friend that always says math is hard. 


## Task: [Step 6: Review] - 3 minutes

- Explain what you would do on this page and complete the application: I would review the application and check every bit of it. 
- Before submitting, let's say you wanted to review what you entered for your dependents and correct some information there. Can you walk me through how you would do that? 

**Participant questions:**
- On a scale of 1-5,how prepared does this page make you feel to submit this application? Why? Strong, 5. 
- Is there any reason you wouldn't submit the application at this step? Because I needed to get the discharge paper and upload them. That’s only because I haven’t started drinking yet, just kidding. 


## Task: [Step 6: Confirmation] - 3 minutes

- What are your thoughts on this page now that you have submitted your application? It took me to the bottom again. I would be waiting for an email probably. This spot right here is the contact I would expect or a phone call but these days I would expect an email. In years past I wouldn’t have expected a letter until 4-6 weeks. This would’ve been done with paperwork on the front end. It was as easy as it would have been. The login process is retarded all of those entities are as dumb as dumb can be. 
Why: there are to many choices. You don’t know which on is the right one or which will be obsolete next week,. 
Do you feel like veterans feel that way as well: yes absolutely because they were going through a process where you had to change the login every 30 days. I could have started a pitchfork session to burn the house down. You cant expect me to have more security on my mind then the gatekeepers have at the ivory tower. On a daily we lose information btu we have to change our password every 30 days. I don’t even remember to take my medication. 
- What are your expectations of what is on this page and what would happen next? Theres the syntax there if they haven’t contacted us in a week. Fire them. It all seems squared off.
- Would you do anything on this page or pause before moving on?
    

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

- How likely are you to recommend this online application to another Veteran? Wel it’s the only game in town. Well what other options are there. I like the format, fonts, who I am doing business with and who put it together due to my relation with you guys. I am 11 out of 10. If I was in the legislative position I wouldn’t have an issue cutting you checks daily because it is obvious that you are doing the work. 

- Did any of the questions stand out to you as unnecessary? No everything that is being asked isn’t done with condescending  tones. It is being done in a way that is not treating them link they are grunts. The tone of what you are doing I am very appreciative of. 
- Did anything seem to be missing? My immediate approval. I was being obnoxious. People accept immediate approval then get a check or direct deposit by COB and that’s not going to happen. Its charming they don’t understand how it use to be. 
- Any questions for me?


## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

I want to circle back and re-confirm with you that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners. Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
If participant says yes: Is there any part of our discussion that you would NOT want shared in a video clip?

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again and enjoy the rest of your day!
