## Task: [Start Application] - 5 minutes

- For this session today, we are going to work through the scenario that you are interested in applying for VA health care. Please use your own information, except for your social security number. For that number, make one up. You'll be able to submit the application, but it won't be a real application, so it won't be processed by the VA. Also, in this case you won't log in with your VA user account.

- You arrive at [this page](https://staging.va.gov/health-care/apply/application/introduction). Please explain what the content on this page means to you and what you would do next.

[Link to staging site of introduction page to the 10-10EZ health care application]

Content, and what would you do here: I would click sign in to start your application. It is clear that you are here to apply and the only thing I see is the start application without signing in, so if I didn’t have a sign in it would be easy to overlook that. I like that at the top you can find out about mental health care. A lot of veterans I work with don’t want to go to the va for day-to-day things but need mental health services. 

**Participant questions:**
- On a scale of 1-5, how prepared does this page make you feel about the application you are about to begin? - Why did you give it that rating? I would say a 5 because it lists everything you need (reading page) it is very clear the thing you will need. 
- Can you tell us more about what you would have to do in preparation for filling out this application?
- would you sign in: yeah I would because I have been on the system for 13 years, it is automatic for me to sign in now before I do anything on va. 
- [If participant says they would sign in] What method/login would you use to sign in? How often do you sign in to VA.gov? I use ID.me. Pretty often because I am constantly looking for information for veterans. 




## Task: [Step 1: Veteran Information] - 5 minutes
- Could you please complete this section of the form and talk aloud about what you would need to do as you go: It is pretty straight forward. Yeah it is straightforward and easy. Okay it says step 1 of six so it makes you feel like there are only 6 pages. 
-Why: it says 1 of 6 but I am three pages in. it just says 1 of 6. 
I like that you can search for the facility, if I was a new veteran looking for healthcare I wouldn’t know the closest one is an hour and 15 minutes away. 



## Task: [Step 2: VA Benefits] - 3 minutes (skip/select no if time crunched)
- Continue completing the questions in the section of the form: No feedback provided



## Task: [Step 3: Military Service] - 2 minutes

- Continue completing the application and answer the fields about your military service information: So do I need to fill out that I was discharged due to a disability. 

## Task: [Step 3: Military Service / Upload Document] - 3 minutes (skip/select no if time crunched)

- Can you please explain the instructions on this page?  I like the fact you can upload from your phone. Right here when I got out I had to dig through boxes to find this information and now its just on my phone so I can just upload it. The va lost my paperwork 4 times when I got out, luckily I had copies but now I can say hey I uploaded it on this date to your systems. 
- Can you tell me more about what you would have to do to get this document and complete this task?  Saved on my phone.
What if it wasn’t: I would request it if I didn’t have it or go through files then take pictures to upload. 
A link to where you can request your dd214 would be good here. 



## Task: [Step 4: Household Information / Financial Disclosure] - 3 minutes

- Begin completing this section of the health care application. 
- Talk through what the content means to you and what you would do: It all seems pretty straightforward. 



## Task: [Step 4: Household Information / Spouse Information] - 5 minutes
- Proceed with the application with answering the next question. 
- [If selected Married/Separated for Marital Status] Continue completing all the questions about your spouse and please remember to think aloud: No feedback provided. 


## Task: [Step 4: Household Information / Dependents / Experimental Pattern] - 5 minutes

- For this scenario, we would like you to answer as if you have 2 dependents.
- Please answer the questions on this page and proceed through that scenario. You can use fake information for fields like SSN and I can help prompt you with information if needed: No feedback provided


- [Once added the first dependent] Now can you add that second dependent: It is straightforward, even if I didn’t now a bunch about filling out online forms this would be easy. 
- [Once both are added] Okay, now let's say you need to make changes to your first dependent - you need to correct their birthdate. Can you please walk me through how you would go about doing that? Click the edit button I like tis right under the name so you don’t need to click back and forward a lot. The fact that you can cancel editing is nice. 
- Can you show me how you could take a dependent off of this application? I like that the remove is red with and X. Yeah and it double check that you want to remove in case you accidently hit remove.
 Again there’s the safety  that you are done with dependents/



## Task: [Step 4: Household Information / Income and Deductibles] - 5 minutes

- Complete the questions asked on this page. Please talk aloud about the questions and information presented to you here: Very easy to answer. 
Realistic numbers: No
- [Continue clicked by participant and they answered married/separated] Complete your spouse's income information: No feedback provided
- In real life, how long would it take you to gather and make sure you were entering the correct information here? Again it being digital it would be easy to pull up a bank statement and calculator to see how much I make. Also bank statements to see how much I paid; we are in the digital age so its easy to look it up
Know where to find it and not take long to look up: Correct. 


## Task: [Step 5: Insurance Information] - 3 minutes (skip/select no if time crunched)

- Please explain what this section of the form means to you as you work through answering the questions: 


## Task: [Step 5: Insurance Information / Facilities] - 2 minutes (skip/select no if time crunched)

- What are your impressions of what this page is asking for and why it is needed for this application? Um again I like that you can use the locator form the page and then you can close it. I like that it ahs do you want the va to contact you. me and other veterans don’t like making the call so it would be great for them to call and setup the appointment. I really like that question if we want the va to contact us to schedule
Why is it needed: to make sure there is care around you and community care since it is over an hour drive. I think that gives them an idea of where you are at and an idea of where you need your care and location. 


## Task: [Step 6: Review] - 3 minutes

- Explain what you would do on this page and complete the application:.
- Before submitting, let's say you wanted to review what you entered for your dependents and correct some information there. Can you walk me through how you would do that?  Okay I would double check the information to make sure it is correct. I like that I can update it without going back. I definitely like the edits. 

**Participant questions:**
- On a scale of 1-5, how prepared does this page make you feel to submit this application? Why? Actually really prepares. Again you can review everything, it has doubled checked the entries and if you messed up you can edit it right there. I would feel very comfortable to submit it. A 5
- Is there any reason you wouldn't submit the application at this step? Other than personal preference I don’t see why you wouldn’t submit it. 


## Task: [Step 6: Confirmation] - 3 minutes

- What are your thoughts on this page now that you have submitted your application? I like that you can print the application. I would like a button to save it to your phone as a file. My printer doesn’t work and hasn’t for like 12 years. A place to download it to your phone would be a good addition. I like that you can click to see what happens after you apply. I would also put how long will it take, maybe a statement that due to differences in cases there is no estimated timeframe as a warning. I know it took me 10 years to get 100 percent and when I first applied it seemed like it took forever before I got information. It was very stressful to know if I had healthcare or not. 
- What are your expectations of what is on this page and what would happen next? Next would be to go to the healthcare application page to sign up for that page. 
- Would you do anything on this page or pause before moving on?  No
    

When you were back on the financial sharing page, how would you normally answer that: I would have answered the question because if I don’t enter it, it would make the process longer.
Why: if you aren’t service connected than they don’t know how much you make and how much you will need to pay. If you don’t enter it, it makes the process longer
How did you find that out: it’s a lot of things. I do paperwork for people all the time and if they don’t have all of the information it takes it longer. It would be the va calling me 10 days later to ask me to take it to the office or email it in, just that adds 10 days. It’s hard to answer because I have just always known that. 

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

- How likely are you to recommend this online application to another Veteran? Definitely a 10, I am constantly prompting veterans to sigh up to see if they get benefits. I volunteer with the wounded warrior project. Even the older veterans could use this even if they aren’t tech savvy as my generation. 
- Did any of the questions stand out to you as unnecessary? No, I though they were needed. If you don’t ask about dependent then that effects service connections, income. They all tie in pretty well. 
- Did anything seem to be missing? No. 
- Any questions for me? I have done one of these before and seen the app change and I really appreciate you doing this. 


## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

I want to circle back and re-confirm with you that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners. Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
If participant says yes: Is there any part of our discussion that you would NOT want shared in a video clip?

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again and enjoy the rest of your day!
