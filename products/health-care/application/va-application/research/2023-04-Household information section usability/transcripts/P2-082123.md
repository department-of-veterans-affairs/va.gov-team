# Conversation Guide for [1010 Team, 10-10EZ, Household financial information section usability/UAT]

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? Yes sir. 
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners, if we remove any information that can be used to identify you? Yes that’s fine. 


## Task: [Start Application] - 5 minutes

- For this session today, we are going to work through the scenario that you are interested in applying for VA health care. Please use your own information, except for your social security number. For that number, make one up. You'll be able to submit the application, but it won't be a real application, so it won't be processed by the VA. Also, in this case you won't log in with your VA user account.

- You arrive at [this page](https://staging.va.gov/health-care/apply/application/introduction). Please explain what the content on this page means to you and what you would do next.

**Participant questions:**
- On a scale of 1-5, how prepared does this page make you feel about the application you are about to begin? - Why did you give it that rating? 5 is a good one, 5 is fine. It is easy to maneuver. I like that you can save it and come back. Right in case you don’t have the information you can save it and then come back to fill in.
Something you’d like to do, your intent: Yes because when I was going through the process I had things missing that I couldn’t remember and had to go look for the information to put in.  
- Can you tell us more about what you would have to do in preparation for filling out this application? 
- What method/login would you use to sign in? How often do you sign in to VA.gov?



## Task: [Step 1: Veteran Information] - 5 minutes
- Could you please complete this section of the form and talk aloud about what you would need to do as you go: Why would you have three address lines. 
Use to only having two: Right. Unless you are overseas I guess. 
Are you clicking enter to go to the next page: I hit state to do the address and it gave me this. 
It gave me an error message I don’t know it went crazy. 


## Task: [Step 2: VA Benefits] - 3 minutes (skip/select no if time crunched)
- Continue completing the questions in the section of the form: No Feedback provided


## Task: [Step 3: Military Service] - 2 minutes

- Continue completing the application and answer the fields about your military service information: Is on year less or more. I cant remember. Is it one day off when you get out. This one doesn’t look familiar. I guess that’s for the PACT act.  


## Task: [Step 3: Military Service / Upload Document] - 3 minutes (skip/select no if time crunched)

- Can you please explain the instructions on this page?  I do have a copy of my dd214 on my phone so I would probably be doing this on my phone to tell you the truth. 
- Can you tell me more about what you would have to do to get this document and complete this task? I would need to find a scanner to have the copy. 
Physical  copy that you would scan to the computer: yes that’s why I keep a copy on my phone. 


## Task: [Step 4: Household Information / Financial Disclosure] - 3 minutes

- Begin completing this section of the health care application. 
- Talk through what the content means to you and what you would do: I guess I would say yes. 
Normally say no: I would put yes. It has been so long since I filled out this form but I think I put yes. 
Reasoning: If I wasn’t over the 50 percent I would put in my financial information to make sure I get some kinda service form the va
By providing the information the va will provide service: Yes.  


## Task: [Step 4: Household Information / Spouse Information] - 5 minutes
- Proceed with the application with answering the next question. 
- [If selected Married/Separated for Marital Status] Continue completing all the questions about your spouse and please remember to think aloud: 
Press enter after entering in the information: Yes and it wen to the relationship status. 




## Task: [Step 4: Household Information / Dependents / Experimental Pattern] - 5 minutes

- For this scenario, we would like you to answer as if you have 2 dependents.
- Please answer the questions on this page and proceed through that scenario. You can use fake information for fields like SSN and I can help prompt you with information if needed: No feedback provided

- [Once added the first dependent] Now can you add that second dependent: I clicked enter right after I entered it then it went down here. 
- [Once both are added] Okay, now let's say you need to make changes to your first dependent - you need to correct their birthdate. Can you please walk me through how you would go about doing that? I would go to edit. 
- Can you show me how you could take a dependent off of this application? I would hit remove. 


## Task: [Step 4: Household Information / Income and Deductibles] - 5 minutes

- Complete the questions asked on this page. Please talk aloud about the questions and information presented to you here: Right, I don’t work I only collect SSDI. You don’t want to make the  mistake on the forms. Yeah that’s pretty much it. You want to put in accurate information, it’s just a joke I heard the tother day. I travel a lot and someone said that one way to do a background check is if they travel and have TSA precheck because Uncle Sam already did it for you. I am thinking about the background check and things people have been turned down for on global entry for bringing food out of the country and things like that. I just got back and that’s what happened and June I was in CA and HI. We alternate from foreign travel so that’s why its on my mind. Italy changed the visa information. It doesn’t include SSDI
Surprised: yes because both agencies have a difference on who’s disabled and what income is. Its also state by state. 
I will also check to make sure. 
Sounds like each agency ahs their down definition: right, you have to be careful
Drop down helpful: Yes. It is helpful. 
- [Continue clicked by participant and they answered married/separated] Complete your spouse's income information.
- In real life, how long would it take you to gather and make sure you were entering the correct information here?


## Task: [Step 5: Insurance Information] - 3 minutes (skip/select no if time crunched)

- Please explain what this section of the form means to you as you work through answering the questions: No feedback provided


## Task: [Step 5: Insurance Information / Facilities] - 2 minutes (skip/select no if time crunched)
Using the keyboard: yes I was then I hit enter. It wouldn’t go anywhere else
Both keyboard and mouse: I use the up and down arrow. It down go down, oh now it does. 
Scrolling, mouse or keyboard: I remember I had a mouse so I engaged it. 
This is not in alphabetical order
Using keyboard: The down arrow. Why is this not in alphabetical order. That looks kinda jumbled. 
Awkward because of only using the arrows instead of the dropdown: Right, I right to use the arrow because I thought it would be alphabetical order, what’s the arraignment. It’s not even by county. I thought maybe Tampa but Orlando has its own thing. That’s a jumbled mess. Some of it. Oh I got it. I think I got it. Normally they go by medical center not the clinic. The clinic would be under the big umbrella. That’s my experience. Now I know how its arranged, that’s not good. It was confusing. 
Reason you said no for va contacting you: Yeah because I would rather contact them. 
Personal preference: Right. I would want to make sure I get it scheduled. If they call me I don’t know when they will call me or try to contact me so I would rather contact them myself. 
Timeframe important: yes I right to do morning appointments but no Monday’s. If they are running late in the afternoon then they will make me late or they skip lunch and in a bad mood so I prefer morning to get it over with. 
- What are your impressions of what this page is asking for and why it is needed for this application? No feedback provided

## Task: [Step 6: Review] - 3 minutes

- Explain what you would do on this page and complete the application.
- Before submitting, let's say you wanted to review what you entered for your dependents and correct some information there. Can you walk me through how you would do that?  I would double check the information and make sure it is accurate
Open each section: yes, that’s me I don’t know about anyone else. 
How to edit: I would click edit. I only put the town no9t the state or region. I didn’t see Puerto Rico listed. I guess I would put other. That’s strange. 
Strange because the Puerto Rico isn’t listed: Correct. The territories should be listed. There are people born on bases, I was an army brat so I met a lot of people while their parents were serving. 

**Participant questions:**
- On a scale of 1-5,how prepared does this page make you feel to submit this application? Why? Um pretty good. Yes it would be a 5. 
- Is there any reason you wouldn't submit the application at this step? If I had anything incomplete. I am assuming I uploaded the documents needed. 
% years, I already served 5 years I don’t need to serve anymore. Is this like a dummy one. 


## Task: [Step 6: Confirmation] - 3 minutes

- What are your thoughts on this page now that you have submitted your application? Um. It is pretty easy. Its cool that you can print a copy
Expectation: you might forget when you applied so it is helpful to have a hard copy for personal records. 
- What are your expectations of what is on this page and what would happen next? I like the highlighted sections. Theres a number to talk to someone with a pulse.
Application or confirmation you want to print: I would print the confirmation. It is always good to have a hard copy of any application you filled out.  
Expectations after completing the form: It has the highlighted area. You always try to find out how long it will take. It says if you haven’t been contacted in a week call the number
Want a timeframe: yes that it has at least been received. 
- Would you do anything on this page or pause before moving on?


## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

- How likely are you to recommend this online application to another Veteran? I would, 10. It is easy to maneuver. Other than no Puerto Rico though and putting other. 
- Did any of the questions stand out to you as unnecessary? The one when did they become a dependent. Well maybe a stepchild. I don’t know, it’s more of a male orientated thing. XYZ things going on I don’t want to insult anyone. The income questions and the criteria, SSDI wasn’t counted as income. 
- Did anything seem to be missing? No because it asked for the DD214. Maybe a photo id since you are doing online. Someone could fine a dd214 and claim to be that person, so id just to check the identity. 
- Any questions for me? No


## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

I want to circle back and re-confirm with you that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners. Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
If participant says yes: Is there any part of our discussion that you would NOT want shared in a video clip?

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again and enjoy the rest of your day!
