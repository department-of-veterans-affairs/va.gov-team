This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered. 


**The goal of this document is:**

 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

## Initial Findings

**Veterans were able to edit and remove dependents with relative ease using the new experimental pattern.**

- All participants successfully removed dependents.

**Finding dependents from review page can be a challenge.**

Some participants struggled with finding their dependents within the bulk of information on the Review page. Nearly every participant stated they would expand every section to review their submission, resulting in a large amount of content to search through.

**Veterans take their time and are careful when completing form fields.**

Our Veteran participants mentioned want to get things correct, reading content cautiously and checking their work.

**It's unclear to Veterans why they need to submit data that IRS later verifies.**

Several Veterans mentioned they know their income and household information will be verified by the IRS. Filling out this portion of the form that the IRS already has data on seemed unnecessary.

**Veterans want transparency into lengthy, messy VA processes.**

Participants mentioned wanted transparency around how long the application process might take, acknowledging that VA processes can take longer than expected.

**Login is still a frustration for Veterans who want the benefit of an authenticated experience.**

Some Veteran participants expressed frustration with the cumbersome login experience. The ability to login is valuable, allowing them to save their work and pre-fill information—this login tension dilutes their over VA.gov experience.
