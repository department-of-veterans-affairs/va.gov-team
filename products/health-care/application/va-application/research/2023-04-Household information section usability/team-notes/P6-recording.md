# Conversation Guide for [1010 Team, 10-10EZ, Household financial information section usability/UAT]

## P6

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners, if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?**



## Task: [Start Application] - 5 minutes

- For this session today, we are going to work through the scenario that you are interested in applying for VA health care. Please use your own information, except for your social security number. For that number, make one up. You'll be able to submit the application, but it won't be a real application, so it won't be processed by the VA. Also, in this case you won't log in with your VA user account.

- You arrive at [this page](https://staging.va.gov/health-care/apply/application/introduction). Please explain what the content on this page means to you and what you would do next.

**Participant questions:**
- On a scale of 1-5 (1 being very poorly and 5 being very well) - how prepared does this page make you feel about the application you are about to begin? - Why did you give it that rating?
> Um, first starting this application process it seems a little overwhelming
> Just becuase there is so much information you have to read through, if you just started doing this
> It seems, yes they put a 1-2-3 on here, but unless you have a lot of time to gather all of this information and go through this, it would seem overwhelming to someone
> I understand with the, it says it only tak an hour, it would take  more than an hour to gather all your information
> If you just got dischared, get all your information
> If you are a spouse filing for a husband or spouse, it would take quite a bit of time
> The time to fill out the form is probably correct, but the time before is quite daunting
> I click on the eligibility requirements to enroll (go through this additional info component)
> In my case, I was discharged under a service connected disability, but, you would have to, it seems harder than what it should be
> I would give it probably about a 3

- Can you tell us more about what you would have to do in preparation for filling out this application?


- [If participant says they would sign in] What method/login would you use to sign in? How often do you sign in to VA.gov?

> Yes, I would sign in in order to keep what I put in there, so it doesn't go away
