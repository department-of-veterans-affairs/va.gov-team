## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them... 

Today we're going to talk about online application for health care.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 1 hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may look and function like the live site but since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I want to be sure before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - If yes: Admit observers. 
    - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)
   - Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete the analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this) or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7. Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
- Last one - one of the ways that we share findings with our partners across VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image. Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not but like to ask ahead of time. I'll also confirm at the end of the interview that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've talked about. 
    - Knowing this, **would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?** 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners, if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?**



## Task: [Start Application] - 5 minutes

- For this session today, we are going to work through the scenario that you are interested in applying for VA health care. Please use your own information, except for your social security number. For that number, make one up. You'll be able to submit the application, but it won't be a real application, so it won't be processed by the VA. Also, in this case you won't log in with your VA user account.

- You arrive at [this page](https://staging.va.gov/health-care/apply/application/introduction). Please explain what the content on this page means to you and what you would do next.

So far it's very easy after screener page.

Why do they want my mother's maiden name? That shouldn't have any barring on me.

Pauses at gender at birth question: I get it, you have to do it now.

It's interesting that when they were your dependent. That could throw folks. What if that had a yes/no beforehand that asked if was adopted/stepchild. Wants it to be responded to the question.

- [Continue clicked by participant and they answered married/separated] Complete your spouse's income information.
- In real life, how long would it take you to gather and make sure you were entering the correct information here? For me, this wouldn't be hard. I do all our taxes online so it's there. For others, it may take a bit.

Would look at non-reimbursable medical expenses if you haven't dealt with the VA before. No one keeps receipts. Maybe they could pull it from statements to get that information. Mentions telling Vets in the past to get print outs of costs when she helped them with pensions.

Misread Medicaid/Medicare initially. No on insurance. I'm trying to get the VA.

## Task: [Step 5: Insurance Information / Facilities] - 2 minutes (skip/select no if time crunched)

- What are your impressions of what this page is asking for and why it is needed for this application? Easy to fill out. Should be easy to look up. Doctors want insurance to pay for it. VA has to pay their staff too.

### Things to watch for:
- [How does the participant prefer to search and/or sort facilities?]
- [Does the participant interact with the additional links on the facilities page?]


---

Mentions thought ACA requirement wasn't being inforced. Would probably click to unserstand it more. Some may ignore it. Mentions how it might set someone off. Facility selection: What if I don't know where VA centers are at? Finds VA locator. Explores that.

## Task: [Step 6: Review] - 3 minutes

- Explain what you would do on this page and complete the application. Would make sure what the info is and make sure it's correct. Still confused about mother's maiden name.

## Task: [Step 6: Confirmation] - 3 minutes

- What are your thoughts on this page now that you have submitted your application? I'm going to have to get a login account if I don't have one to check it. Mail can't be trusted these days. Would like an email from the office when something happens. Mentions the number to call. As long as they answer, it's good.g
- What are your expectations of what is on this page and what would happen next?
- Would you do anything on this page or pause before moving on?
    

### Things to watch for:

- [Does the participant seem unclear on what happens next?]
- [Does the participant feel confident that they know what the next steps in the process are?]
- [Does the participant have positive or negative reaction to the confirmation page?]



## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

- [NPS Question]
- How likely are you to recommend this online application to another Veteran? [Scale of 0 - 10] 10 Has told Veterans to go explore online. Spent 20 years not knowing she was eligible. Didn't have a TAPS class.

- Did any of the questions stand out to you as unnecessary? No other one.
- Did anything seem to be missing?
- Any questions for me?


## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

I want to circle back and re-confirm with you that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners. Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing, and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
If participant says yes: Is there any part of our discussion that you would NOT want shared in a video clip?

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
