# [DRAFT] Research Plan: VSA 10-10, UAT of shortened form based on disability rating, Health Care application 10-10EZ, June 2022

## Background
This research is to be conducted on the Health Care Application (10-10EZ) by the 10-10 Health Apps team.

Based on our [Google Analytics](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HDGBx-whUrSArDLf8OP_-65lCMPi36h0ihHPA3XqmIk/edit#slide=id.p1) data and [Discovery research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/10-10EZ/Research%20April-May%202021/End%20user%20discovery%20research/research%20findings.md) we have identified that the Military Service and Household Information sections of the 10-10EZ cause applicants the most confusion, time, and show the highest drop-off rates. As part of an iterative process we have created [shortened form flows](https://www.sketch.com/s/da85cf44-4503-4e98-834e-ff068b242ef6/p/A71F1C96-FF98-42A2-9ADD-6D4B7A1DDB20) that eliminate these two sections for those that we identify to have a service-connected disability rating of 50% or higher either through information we already have on file (pre-populated) or by the applicant self-reporting it during the application. In the future, we will look into expanding this short form experience for other qualifying questions.

In September 2021 prototype [usability research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/10-10EZ/Short%20form%20flow%20research/Research%20findings.md) validated the flows that are now in production. The primary purpose of this research is to test the designs/flows in production and reach participant populations that we were unable to reach due to prototype limitations. Additionally A/B testing will be conducted on the two design options for the self-report confirmation screen as collab cycle as suggested that Design B is more in alignment with the design system. 

## Goals	
The primary goal of our UAT is to confirm that the short form functionality for each of our [use cases](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/product/Short-form-use-cases.md) works as expected.

The goals of this user research are to:
1. Validate that there are no issues or bugs for authenticated users with 50% or greater disability rating on record
2. Validate that there are no issues or bugs for authenticated users with less than 50% disability rating on record
3. Validate that there are no issues or bugs for authenticated users with no disability rating on record, but self-report a disability rating of 50% or higher
4. Validate that there are no issues or bugs for authenticated users with no disability rating on record and don't self-report a disability rating of 50% or higher
5. Validate that there are no issues or bugs for unauthenticated users that self-report a disability rating of 50% or higher
6. Validate that there are no issues or bugs for unauthenticated users that don't self-report a disability rating of 50% or higher


**Research questions**
1. Does the functionality work as expected?
2. Is any aspect of the flow surprising/unexpected?
3. Are there any indications of UX issues?


**Hypothesis**
- The functionality of each use case will work as expected.
- No bugs will be experienced.
- Veterans will move through the flow easily.


## Method	
We'll have participants go through a list of specific tasks for UAT and ask follow-up questions to get feedback on any usability-related findings.
