This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered. 


**The goal of this document is:**
 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes 

- - - 

Overall, both the pre-populated and self-reported short form flows were usable, understood, and did not create a barrier for form completion. The majority of the research participants expressed that they were positively surprised by how short and easy the application was (with these short form flows). During the research, we updated the design of the self-reported short form alert, this showed improved visibility of the alert that resulted in greater awareness and time expectation of the short form.
Additionally, the updated Introduction page showed significant read-through completion improvement from our [Discovery research conducted in May of 2021](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/10-10EZ/Research%20April-May%202021/End%20user%20discovery%20research/research%20findings.md). The majority of participants read the majority of the Introduction page without being prompted and were able to accurately state what documents they needed in order to complete the application. 
 
 
# Initial Findings
 ## All short form flows
 **The majority of participants feel that this flow is much quicker and easier than they expected**
- The majority of participants expressed that the short form met their expectations of being shorter, and they were pleasantly surprised how quickly they were able to complete it.
> "It was super fast and super easy. I thought I would need to track down all that, [documents] but since I had a login and had a service connected disability it filled it out for me and I didn’t need that."

> _Was there anything that stood out to you?_ “Just the ease of use, I did not expect it to be that fast."

> _Tell me about this experience in your own words, as if I was another Veteran interested in applying for health care._ “I would recommend it because of how easy it was for me. Even if I didn’t have the application filled out (referring to short form) I still feel like it would be easy. There’s guided step-by-step instructions.”
 
 **On the review page some participants were confused or had questions as to why they had not been asked for some of the documents listed on the Introduction "Gather your information" section, and some felt that they would have spent unnecessary time looking for those documents before starting**
- Because people are now reading the Introduction more thoroughly, they have the expectation that they will be asked for documents related to their military service and income. None of the participants expressed that this would keep them from submitting their application, but thought it could cause some worry that their application would be incomplete. One participant thought that they would also like to provide their medical history information, although this is not something listed on the Introduction page.

> "I would just wonder how to get the records to them and by what method. It is what you would need if applying from scratch. They would need the health records in order to confirm I have the need for care.”

> “At the beginning it said I needed my income and expenses, but I never had to enter that. Since I don’t enter it, I would take that out because I don’t know I would have figured that out. Maybe I would’ve said I couldn’t apply yet, but I didn’t need it. Everything that I entered was stuff anyone would know.”
 
> "How am I as a beginner supposed to provide hard copy data to those that need it? Like do I take it somewhere or do I mail it, are they copies or originals?...My DD214, birth certificate, marriage certification...I had a hard time getting them [in the past], and it delayed my application.”



## Variation 1: Applying to health care benefits, 50% or higher disability rating is known at application start

**All participants shown this variation understood what a "short form" is, why they had received it, and were able to move through the flow naturally and without barriers**
- Upon seeing the alert that they would receive the short form at application start, the participants quickly understood that they would not have to be asked all questions because of their disability rating.

> "I like it, knowing I won't need to backtrack on information I provided over the years. I am glad to see that they are keeping record of what they have. If it were me now I would say it will be a lot easier than I thought."
 
> _What do you expect to happen next (after seeing the alert)?_ “That they would already have a lot of the financial information because of the rating I have which makes me unemployable. I am rated at 80, but paid at 100 so they would have my financial information because I can't work over a certain number of hours a year or I lose the 100% rating.”



## Variation 2.1: Applying to health care benefits, 50% or higher disability rating is known at self-report at VA compensation question
 
**The majority of participants were able to move through the flow without barriers**
- All of the participants moved through the flow smoothly. At the end of the application, the participants expressed that the form was quicker and easier than past experience with other health care related applications (VA or not). They felt that the short form set proper expectations.
> "It seems like it was very ordinary. This is exactly how I would expect an application to work.  I am used to a lot of health care forms that ask for your whole medical history. This is faster than filling out medical history at the doctor's office.”

> “This is a simple process.”

> “I thought it was simple and a positive experience. I have had nothing but positive experiences with the VA.”

> "I like the short form, it was sweet and quick."

> “The only expectation was that it was reduced from what others were doing so it is easier to process if over 50%. It was done quicker. So I went from 6 to 4 steps. It makes sense to me.”

**Participants moved through the confirmation step without question or confusion**

- Almost all of the participants moved through this confirmation step without even noting it. A few participants interacted with the more information component and one participant noted that this screen seemed to step out of the process, and was a little uncertain why they were asked to confirm, but once they moved to the next step and saw that they were in the short form, then they understood.

> "This page changed, it's like stepping out of the process...oh I see why you didn't say it was because of the short form before...In case someone put 50% on accident, you don't want them to see there is a short form.”

**Some participants were confused about the step numbers and why the number changed upon entering into the short form**
- With this version many participants noticed that the steps changed from “Step 2 of 6” to “Step 3 of 4.” They all assumed this was due to the short form, but were not exactly sure. Many also expressed that the steps were unclear because there were so many questions on step 1 and only one question in step 2.
> "Okay then wow we ended up on step three. Well I guess it found that because I have a higher disability it didn’t need to go to step 2."

> "Why am I clicking so much to stay on step 1. I have clicked 5 times."

 
**Only about half of participants interacted with the "green accordion alert," and this resulted in some uncertainty as to what information was skipped**

- Because participants that are shown this variation only have 1-2 questions remaining in the application after being put on the short form track, they have very little time to interact with the green accordion alert before finishing the application. About half of the participants did not notice it and/or did not interact with it.

<img width="685" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-17 at 11 04 21 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80857940/133870395-ee8d39fc-ed1e-471a-853a-c3dbb94a1606.png">

> “I didn’t notice [that the alert is clickable] until you pointed it out.”

> _On the review page_ "I would really expect it to show something like a block that states I have a disability rating of 50% or higher. I would expect to see it here since I put that in."

> “Maybe that’s why I didn’t need tax or income. So if I am over 50%, maybe have it note that if you are over 50%…”


## Variation 2.2: Applying to health care benefits, 50% or higher disability rating is known at self-report at VA compensation question - updated alert design and messaging
We updated version 2.1 with a second iteration of the alert design. This design did not require participant interaction, and showed increased awareness of the short form and the sections that would be skipped.


<img width="843" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-17 at 11 03 24 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80857940/133870376-a22a0b84-c042-4c3d-9167-89a370cd700a.png">

**The majority of participants felt like the alert set proper expectations**
- All participants saw the alert, and felt positively upon seeing that they were on step 3 of 4. They expected that the remaining questions would simply be questions that the VA needs to confirm with them or that were not already on their record.
> “Because I am over 50%, I am filling out a shorter application. It will be fewer healthcare questions because if you have 100% then you have provided a lot of information already. I know there are a lot of laws in place regarding eligibility for medical benefits based on ratings. For less than 50% they don’t have to give me everything, but since I am over 50 [percent] they are required by law.”

> “When I saw 3 of 4 I was excited. I don’t think it had step of step when I first started it was just step 1 or 2 then changed to step 3 of 4 here.”
 

 

## Introduction and general application questions (not specifically related to the short form experience)- things that are working well

**The updated Introduction page prepared participants with what documents they will need during the application process well**
- During [Discovery research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/10-10EZ/Research%20April-May%202021/End%20user%20discovery%20research/research%20findings.md) we found that many participants merely skimmed the Introduction as it was quite long. The majority of the participants in that research study went straight to the "Start the application" button. This is a distinct contrast with what we saw in this study that utilized the shortened Introduction and the button that is moved to the bottom. In this study the majority of participants read the entire introduction, commenting that it is clear and prepares them well for what they will need in the application.
> "It is self-explanatory I think. This is covering everything I mentioned to you, I found out about one at a time (referring to when they applied in the past), it's nice to have it grouped together so you know what is required."

> “I would follow the steps, click on the eligibility requirements, then gather information (reading page), then after that I would start the application...I am just reading though the directions quickly because it says sign in to start and start without signing in. It answers the question why. Information will already be entered so I would sign in for the security of it.”

> _Do you have any questions after looking at this page?_ "No, I have a copy of my DD214 on cloud so that’s easy. Insurance, I also have scans of those, I am not sure how hard it is to get them on the tablet though."


**Many participants expressed that they liked the “Need Help?” section was at the bottom of each page, and some said that they would utilize it**
- Many participants pointed out that they liked that the contact information was on the bottom of each page. They were happy that it provided information to contact VSOs as well. People who had confusion on a question said that they would use these resources to answer their questions.
> "Never heard of the MyVA411. Definitely used VSO & regular number, but I wouldn't have thought about VSO, good it was mentioned. Looks good."

> "At the bottom it said if I had issues there was a number to call for help. That was helpful."

 
## Introduction and general application questions (not specifically related to the short form experience)- things that could use improvement

**Some participants find the repeated Introduction (upon sign in) redundant and/or confusing**
- Some participants were confused as to why they were being shown the same page after signing in. Some participants expressed that they felt that they had made a mistake. The participants that expressed this confusion had the expectation that once they signed in, that they would immediately be taken to the application form.
> "Back to basically the same info. Redundant. I've already seen this."

> “I find it weird that I already clicked start and now I have to do it again. Once I said to start it, I expected prefills to come up. I would need to read through this then start the application. When I read this, it doesn’t provide new information. I know it includes this, this doesn’t help me and it takes more time to read.”

> “I really wondered if I signed in correctly and if that was the correct page. That’s why I checked the top right, it looks like the health portal.”


**More than half of variation 2.1 and 2.2 participants had confusion around the "current compensation” question**

- Many participants thought that they receive both service-connected pay for a 50% or higher disability rating and VA pension, thus were confused which one to choose. All who felt this confusion did select the 50% or higher disability rating, but thought this should allow for a multi-checkbox. Many participants thought that the VA pension is for people who retired from the VA. Some participants wondered why they couldn't just disclose their disability rating itself. One participant suggested that there should be a link to check their disability rating if they didn’t know it.

<img width="495" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-17 at 11 15 35 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80857940/133870734-0ae7e1e7-91ad-48cd-9849-74768ead9df6.png">

> "Maybe I don’t think I understand. If anyone is over 50%, you are getting a check, so if I click this (pointing to receives pay for a disability 50% or higher) aren’t I also this (pointing to VA pension).”_What would you do?_ “Choose over 50 [percent], maybe VA pension is for if you worked for the VA. I see where it's different. I realize my thought was wrong. Maybe this VA pension could say this does not include service disability. Just this one needs clarification."

> "Okay what type of compensation do you currently receive...That is confusing because I am 100%,  but do I click on the pension or 50% or higher?” _What would you do?_ “I would put my rating. I think that could use more clarification.” _How do you see them differently?_ “I have a rating but I also get a VA pension so it’s like ‘okay’ which one do I need to put?”

**The Insurance information "Other coverage" question caused uncertainty for many participants, especially for those who have Tricare (through military retirement)**

- Although none of the participants thought this question would stop them from submitting the form, it caused a lot of confusion that could lead to inaccurate input. The main confusion was in the policy number and group number fields. The majority of participants that had Tricare expressed that they didn't think Tricare has a policy or group number. They thought that they would use their Social Security number for this, but were uncertain. Additionally, many participants did not read the part of the label that specifies that only the policy number or the group code is required. Some said they would just make one up, others said that they might contact the VA for help. One participant said that they would just say that they did not have other coverage because they wouldn't want the VA to give them less coverage.

<img width="423" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-17 at 11 17 03 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80857940/133870748-a8f15098-0601-466a-822a-187ba09ba8e7.png">


> (Participant has Tricare) "Group code: This was always just social. I wouldn't have any idea what to put for the group, there was no group number."

> "I can tell you for Tricare there is no group number and it is a required field.” _What would you do?_ “I would put in none and see how they take it. For Tricare, and you’ll have a lot of them with Tricare for life or prime, all you have is the one number that is on your ID card.  You might want to consider a tick mark for Tricare or Medicare instead of the name of the provider."

> “Policy number, for retirees. I would think that the policy number is my DOD number, so I have to clarify what my policy number would be and I have been using it for a little less than a year.” _What would you do?_ “I would login online to see if I can find it. If I can find it, great, if not I would put my DOD number. I think it would be good to only have one required. It took me longer to read it, I think it would say this or group number so I thought I could enter it there. I wouldn’t have entered that until I entered the policy number. I would fill it out in order instead of reading all of it first.”
 
**The majority of participants thought that they would receive a confirmation of application submission by email**
- The majority of participants expected that the page after submission would give them a timeline for application processing, the method they would be notified, and the place they can go to check the application status. Participants also expected to receive updates via email. All expressed that they prefer email and phone over mail, but are accustomed to the VA sending documents by mail.
> _How would you expect to be contacted?_ "Email. But it could also be just continuing to check online for status, but I want a basic time frame. Maybe I should expect an email or maybe I just have to keep checking online."

> “I would expect after submitting it would send an email to my email I listed with a confirmation. Then at some point it would tell me it was accepted. Then a third email once approved. Status updated through email. That is what I would expect.”

> "Having dealt with the VA there is generally an email that comes back acknowledging the submission. I don’t know about checking health status but the disability status, there's a page online to see that it has been submitted... The annoying part was that they sent the letter [by mail], but couldn’t locate the letter online. It has taken longer than a month. My last one took over a month from the time I knew the decision was made, and then I moved and the letter was lost in the mail. Again it is my standard complaint. The correspondence you have to call to get a copy or go to the VA. They can download it but I can’t do that."


**Some participants think that since the form is digital and that they qualify for the short form that they will be enrolled upon submission of the application**
- Two of the participants thought that since this form is digital, potentially linked to their VA record, and they received the short form, that upon submission of the application, they would be automatically enrolled. Because they thought that they would be enrolled they expected the page after submission would show them what their specific benefits are and potentially give them the chance to pick a primary care doctor. This expectation was expressed by less than a fourth of participants, but included in this summary so that it can be monitored in future research.
 
> "Expect after hitting submit: probably tells me what the medical record number is, the phone numbers of departments and maybe it will let me pick a primary doctor."
