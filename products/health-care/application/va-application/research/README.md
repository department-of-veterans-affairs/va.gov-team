## SYNTHESIS OUTLINE

**Research synthesis template**

After and during conducting research sessions, conduct synthesis and create sharable artifacts of key insights and findings.

- Watch recordings as needed (download right after sessions locally to your computer and delete after synthesis complete), 
- Ensure transcripts and team notes in research folder are complete
- Create a Mural board in the [Research Synthesis folder](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/r/1670613238628?folderUuid=19c6c5a7-abf7-4a78-871a-a2993ca57681)
- Move over direct quotes and observations to stickies on the mural board and group to find themes and key insights
- Go to [Platform website - Research quick resources](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-at-va) and copy the latest version of the findings template (markdown file) and presentation template (google doc) to organize findings of study.
- If needed, use the toppling summary template.
- Create any other artifacts or communication tools for other audiences as needed (Stakeholders, etc)
- Update ticket on [research repo](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/projects/1) with key findings. Be sure to write findings in a way that they are meaning ful out of context (not attached to study plan/guides).
