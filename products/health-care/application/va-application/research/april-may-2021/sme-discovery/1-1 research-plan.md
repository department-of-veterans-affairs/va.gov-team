# Research Plan: VSA Caregiver, Discovery phase of Health Care application 10-10EZ, part 1 (subject matter experts), April 2021

## Background

This research is to be conducted on the Health Care Application (10-10EZ) by the Caregivers team.

Live: (https://www.va.gov/health-care/apply/application/introduction)
Staging: (https://staging.va.gov/health-care/apply/application/introduction)

The purpose of this discovery phase of research is to gain a broad understanding of why people start the Health Care Application form, but do not complete it and to start to explore ways of increasing qualified submissions. The data gathered through the Health Care application’s [Analytics](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HDGBx-whUrSArDLf8OP_-65lCMPi36h0ihHPA3XqmIk/edit#slide=id.p1) will serve as a foundation for creating this research plan.

We understand that sometimes a digital application experience can leave out real-world context and offline workarounds. We would like to begin the discovery phase of research by talking to subject-matter experts (SMEs) to better understand how they help applicants work through sections of the application that are particularly difficult, what workarounds are used, and to explore possible ways to make specific sections of the application easier. We also want to gain context of the transition from the paper application to the digital option. 


## Goals

The goals of this user research study are to: 

- Better understand SME perspective on why Veterans start the application, but don’t complete it.
- Gain insight from SMEs who process applications or help Veterans complete applications in regards to workarounds they have found successful ways of working through barriers with applicants.
- Gain understanding of how paper to digital transformation changed how SMEs process applications.
- Better understand SME perspective on areas of potential improvement for the digital form.


### Research questions

The research questions we want to address are: 

- How has processing applications changed (in whatever role SME is) since the digital version became available?
- What outside factors does the digital form overlook? Perhaps special handling methods used before the form was digital that the digital form doesn’t account for.
  - Online forms innately create different obstacles/less flexibility than paper/in-person experiences/processing.
- How do SMEs help applicants work through sections of the form that the data has shown to be roadblocks?
  - What are ways that we can improve these sections for the users?
- What methods do SMEs think can be used to remind users who have saved an application, but have not completed it?
- What do SMEs hear from Veterans about the form?


## Methodology 

### Qualitative 1:1 interviews 
Qualitative Interviews will be conducted remotely with Zoom. Qualitative interviews explore the views, experiences, beliefs and/or motivations of individuals. Remote observers and note takers will be in attendance.
- Interviews will be conducted with VA staff (HEC team, VSO team or community advocates) who process or help Veterans complete Health Care applications submitted both in paper and/or online format.
- Walkthrough of application with some participatory design discussions about key identified high drop-off rate sections.



## Participants and Recruitment

We would like to interview 4-6 subject matter experts (VA staff or volunteers) who have experience processing or helping Veterans complete VA Health Care applications submitted both online and/or with paper. Ideally, they experienced the transition from paper to online form.

**Must have for participants**

All participants must be yes to one of the following questions:

- Do you have experience processing the Veteran Health Care application after submission? (must recruit at least 2)
- Do you have experience helping/advising Veterans complete the Health Care application? (must recruit at least 3)

Answer must be yes for 2 participants: 

- Did you experience the transition from the paper Health Care application to the digitized option?

**Participant pool should in diverse in**

- Type of facility works at (large hospital, small clinic and urban vs. rural)
- Amount of applications handles (a few a month vs. hundreds)
- Years of experience; experience handling paper vs. digital


## Timeline 

**Desired Timeline: April 27 - May 3, 2021**

Session length: 45 minutes 

Please leave 15 minutes in between each session.
