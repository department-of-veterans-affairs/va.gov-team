# Research outline: Health care application 10-10EZ, April/May 2021

## Goals:

The overarching goals of research are to:

* Better understand why Veterans start the application, but donâ€™t complete it.

* Gain human understanding behind the sections that the analytics show high drop-off rates.

* Gain insight of workarounds that are used to overcome barriers offline (eg. when a Veteran submits a paper form).

* Update design/content to improve the user experience and improve the conversation rate of qualified health care applicants.

## Research Outline:
