## Research Goals 

The goals of this user research study are to: 

- Determine whether or not the short form flow is usable and understandable when it is pre-populated at start of authenticated application
- Determine whether or not the short form flow is usable and understandable when it is based on a self-reported, service-connected disability pay for a 50% or higher rating
- Determine whether or not the flow and copy sets proper expectations for the application experience

As a secondary goal, we will also take special note of any participant feedback to the Introduction page as this has recently been updated.

## Research Methodology 

**Task analysis**

We conducted 1 pilot + 14 participant remote, task-based usability studies, with Zoom, using the Perigean contract. Each moderated session was approximately 45 minutes long, in which we asked participants to talk about their health care application experience and fill out one of our 10-10EZ short form flows. The moderator began with introduction questions and prompted participants with guiding questions (from the [conversation guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/10-10EZ/Short%20form%20flow%20research/conversation-guide.md)). Participants were shown one of three UXPin prototyped flows:
1. 4 participants: Short form based on pre-populated disability rating of 50% or higher at application start [V1 Prototype-Immediate alert short form](https://preview.uxpin.com/acda277e33e9629a7ab817f6c93c251b4a60ac56#/pages/141488399/simulate/no-panels?mode=i)
2. 6 participants: Short form based on self-reported disability rating of 50% or higher on VA compensation question [V2.1 Prototype Self-reported short form](https://preview.uxpin.com/19ee97072a3233029149e8865f986abfda4c1aef#/pages/141488374/simulate/no-panels)
3. 4 participants: Short form based on self-reported disability rating of 50% or higher on VA compensation question [V2.2 Prototype Self-reported short form](https://preview.uxpin.com/2a1ce93f62d447e101cfce3c803d20941fba7203#/pages/141808810/simulate/no-panels?mode=i)

## Research Questions

The research questions we sought to address: 
- Are users able to navigate through the pre-populated short form easily and without confusion?
- Are users able to navigate through the short form based on self-reported information easily and without confusion?
- Do users understand what the short form is?
- Do users understand why they can fill out a short form?
- What is the overall sentiment about this short form experience?


## Key Findings

**General**
1. Participants are able to navigate through the pre-populated short form easily and without confusion
2. Participants are able to able to navigate through the short form based on self-reported information easily and without confusion
3. Participants feel that these short form flows are much quicker and easier than they expected
4. On the review page some participants were confused or had questions as to why they had not been asked for some of the documents listed on the Introduction "Gather your information" section, and some felt that they would have spent unnecessary time looking for those documents before starting
5. Participants moved through the confirmation step (shown in V2.1 & V2.2 only) without question or confusion

**Specific to Version 2.1**
1. Some participants were confused about the step numbers and why the number changed upon entering into the short form
2. Only about half of participants interacted with the "green accordion alert," and this resulted in some uncertainty as to what information was skipped

1. More than half of participants shown variation 2.1 and 2.2 had confusion around the "current compensation” question
2. The Insurance information "Other coverage" question caused uncertainty for many participants, especially for those who have Tricare (through military retirement)


## Key Findings - General

### Participants are able to navigate through the pre-populated short form easily and without confusion
- Upon seeing the alert that they would receive the short form at application start, the participants quickly understood that they wouldn't have to answer all questions because of their disability rating.

> "I like it, knowing I won't need to backtrack on information I provided over the years. I am glad to see that they are keeping record of what they have. If it were me now I would say it will be a lot easier than I thought."

> _What do you expect to happen next (after seeing the alert)?_ “That they would already have a lot of the financial information because of the rating I have which makes me unemployable. I am rated at 80 [percent], but paid at 100 [percent] so they would have my financial information because I can't work over a certain number of hours a year or I lose the 100% rating.”

### Participants are able to able to navigate through the short form based on self-reported information easily and without confusion
- At the end of the application, the participants expressed that the form was quicker and easier than past experience with other health care related applications (VA or not). They felt that the short form set proper expectations.
> "It seems like it was very ordinary. This is exactly how I would expect an application to work. I am used to a lot of health care forms that ask for your whole medical history. This is faster than filling out medical history at the doctor's office.”

> “The only expectation was that it was reduced from what others were doing so it is easier to process if over 50%. It was done quicker. So I went from 6 to 4 steps. It makes sense to me.”


### Participants feel that these short form flows are much quicker and easier than they expected
- The majority of participants expressed that the short form met their expectations of being shorter, and they were pleasantly surprised how quickly they were able to complete it.
> “This is a simple process.”

>  “I thought it was simple and a positive experience. I have had nothing but positive experiences with the VA.”

>  "I like the short form, it was sweet and quick."

> "It was super fast and super easy. I thought I would need to track down all that, [documents] but since I had a login and had a service connected disability it filled it out for me and I didn’t need that."

> _Was there anything that stood out to you?_ “Just the ease of use, I did not expect it to be that fast."

> _Tell me about this experience in your own words, as if I was another Veteran interested in applying for health care._ “I would recommend it because of how easy it was for me. even if I didn’t have the application filled out (referring to short form) I still feel like it would be easy. There’s guided step-by-step instructions.”


### On the review page some participants were confused or had questions as to why they had not been asked for some of the documents listed on the Introduction "Gather your information" section, and some felt that they would have spent unnecessary time looking for those documents before starting
- Because people are now reading the Introduction more thoroughly, they have the expectation that they will be asked for documents related to their military service and income. None of the participants expressed that this would keep them from submitting their application, but thought it could cause some worry that their application would be incomplete. One participant thought that they would also like to provide their medical history information, although this is not something listed on the Introduction page.
> "I expected it to be longer because of having to track down the finances and DD214. Then when it didn’t need that, I was surprised."

> "I would just wonder how to get the records to them and by what method. It is what you would need if applying from scratch. They would need the health records in order to confirm I have the need for care.”

> “At the beginning it said I needed my income and expenses, but I never had to enter that. Since I don’t enter it, I would take that out because I don’t know I would have figured that out. Maybe I would’ve said I couldn’t apply yet, but I didn’t need it. Everything that I entered was stuff anyone would know.”

> "How am I as a beginner supposed to provide hard copy data to those that need it? Like do I take it somewhere or do I mail it, are they copies or originals?...My DD214, birth certificate, marriage certification...I had a hard time getting them [in the past], and it delayed my application.”

### Participants moved through the confirmation step (shown in V2.1 & V2.2 only) without question or confusion
- Almost all of the participants moved through this confirmation step without even noting it. A few participants interacted with the more information component and one participant noted that this screen seemed to step out of the process, and was a little uncertain why they were asked to confirm, but once they moved to the next step and saw that they were in the short form, then they understood.

> "This page changed, it's like stepping out of the process...oh I see why you didn't say it was because of the short form before...In case someone put 50% on accident, you don't want them to see there is a short form.”


## Key Findings - Specific to Version 2.1

### Some participants were confused about the step numbers and why the number changed upon entering into the short form
 - With this version many participants noticed that the steps changed from “Step 2 of 6” to “Step 3 of 4.” They all assumed this was due to the short form, but were not exactly sure. Many also expressed that the steps were unclear because there were so many questions on step 1 and only one question in step 2.

> "Okay then wow we ended up on step three. Well I guess it found that because I have a higher disability it didn’t need to go to step 2."

> "Why am I clicking so much to stay on step 1? I have clicked 5 times."


### Only about half of participants interacted with the "green accordion alert," and this resulted in some uncertainty as to what information was skipped
- Because participants that are shown this variation only have 1-2 questions remaining in the application after being put on the short form track, they have very little time to interact with the green accordion alert before finishing the application. About half of the participants did not notice it and/or did not interact with it.

<img width="442" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-17 at 11 04 21 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80857940/134039124-9b8d736f-9e7b-4ddb-bd24-7551a06819fe.png">

> “I didn’t notice [that the alert is clickable] until you pointed it out.”

> “Maybe that’s why I didn’t need tax or income. So if I am over 50%, maybe have it note that if you are over 50%…”


## Key Findings - Specific to Version 2.2
We updated version 2.1 with a second iteration of the alert design. This design did not require participant interaction, and showed increased awareness of the short form and the sections that would be skipped.

<img width="843" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-17 at 11 03 24 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80857940/134039216-822caaa6-f296-4529-b507-7eb3d60ffc4e.png">

### The majority of participants felt like the alert set proper expectations.
- All participants saw the alert, and felt positively upon seeing that they were on step 3 of 4. They expected that the remaining questions would simply be questions that the VA needs to confirm with them or that were not already on their record.

> “Because I am over 50%, I am filling out a shorter application. It will be fewer healthcare questions because if you have 100% then you have provided a lot of information already. I know there are a lot of laws in place regarding eligibility for medical benefits based on ratings. For less than 50% they don’t have to give me everything, but since I am over 50 [percent] they are required by law.”

> “When I saw 3 of 4 I was excited. I don’t think it had step of step when I first started it was just step 1 or 2 then changed to step 3 of 4 here.”


## Key Findings - Introduction and general application questions (not specifically related to the short form experience)- things that are working well

### The updated Introduction page prepared participants with what documents they will need during the application process well
- During [Discovery research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/10-10EZ/Research%20April-May%202021/End%20user%20discovery%20research/research%20findings.md) we found that many participants merely skimmed the Introduction as it was quite long. The majority of the participants in that research study went straight to the "Start the application" button. This is a distinct contrast with what we saw in this study that utilized the shortened Introduction and the button that is moved to the bottom. In this study the majority of participants read the entire Introduction page, commenting that it is clear and prepares them well for what they will need in the application.
> "It is self-explanatory I think. This is covering everything I mentioned to you, I found out about one at a time [referring to when they applied in the past], it's nice to have it grouped together so you know what is required."

> “I would follow the steps, click on the eligibility requirements, then gather information (reading page), then after that I would start the application...I am just reading though the directions quickly because it says sign in to start and start without signing in. It answers the question why. Information will already be entered so I would sign in for the security of it.”

> _Do you have any questions after looking at this page?_ "No, I have a copy of my DD214 on cloud so that’s easy. Insurance, I also have scans of those, I am not sure how hard it is to get them on the tablet though."

## Introduction and general application questions (not specifically related to the short form experience)- things that could use improvement
### More than half of variation 2.1 and 2.2 participants had confusion around the "current compensation” question
- Many participants thought that they receive both service-connected pay for a 50% or higher disability rating and VA pension, thus were confused which one to choose. All who felt this confusion did select the 50% or higher disability rating, but thought this should allow for a multi-checkbox. Many participants thought that the VA pension is for people who retired from the VA. Some participants wondered why they couldn't just disclose their disability rating itself. One participant suggested that there should be a link to check their disability rating if they didn’t know it.

<img width="495" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-17 at 11 15 35 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80857940/134039386-84d72dad-e424-4ebf-b12f-f39b70f84588.png">

> "Maybe I don’t think I understand. If anyone is over 50%, you are getting a check, so if I click this (pointing to receives pay for a disability 50% or higher) aren’t I also this (pointing to VA pension).”
> _What would you do?_ “Choose over 50 [percent], maybe VA pension is for if you worked for the VA. I see where it's different. I realize my thought was wrong. Maybe this VA pension could say this does not include service disability. Just this one needs clarification."

> "Okay what type of compensation do you currently receive...That is confusing because I am 100%, but do I click on the pension or 50% or higher?” 
> _What would you do?_ “I would put my rating. I think that could use more clarification.” 
> _How do you see them differently?_ “I have a rating but I also get a VA pension so it’s like ‘okay’ which one do I need to put?”

### The Insurance information "Other coverage" question caused uncertainty for many participants, especially for those who have Tricare (through military retirement)
- Although none of the participants thought this question would stop them from submitting the form, it caused a lot of confusion that could lead to inaccurate input. The main confusion was in the policy number and group number fields. The majority of participants that had Tricare expressed that they thought that they would use their Social Security number for this, but were uncertain. Additionally, many participants did not read the part of the label that specifies that only the policy number or the group code is required. Some said they would just make one up, others said that they might contact the VA for help. One participant said that they would just say that they did not have other coverage because they wouldn't want the VA to give them less coverage.

<img width="439" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-20 at 12 32 57 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80857940/134039546-3b3a694d-58ef-413f-93ae-c2457fa8d5cb.png">

> _(Participant has Tricare)_ "Group code: This was always just social. I wouldn't have any idea what to put for the group, there was no group number."

> "I can tell you for Tricare there is no group number and it is a required field.” 
> _What would you do?_ “I would put in none and see how they take it. For Tricare, and you’ll have a lot of them with Tricare for life or prime, all you have is the one number that is on your ID card. You might want to consider a tick mark for Tricare or Medicare instead of the name of the provider."

> “Policy number, for retirees. I would think that the policy number is my DOD number, so I have to clarify what my policy number would be and I have been using it for a little less than a year.” 
> _What would you do?_ “I would login online to see if I can find it. If I can find it, great, if not I would put my DOD number. I think it would be good to only have one required. It took me longer to read it, I think it would say this or group number so I thought I could enter it there. I wouldn’t have entered that until I entered the policy number. I would fill it out in order instead of reading all of it first.”

## Additional Insights
*  Some participants find the repeated Introduction (upon sign in) redundant and/or confusing
*  Some participants think that since the form is digital and that they qualify for the short form that they will be enrolled upon submission of the application
* Many participants expressed that they liked the “Need Help?” section is at the bottom of each page, especially that it suggests VSOs. Some said that they would utilize it
* The majority of participants thought that they would receive a confirmation of application submission via email


### Hypotheses

1. Users will be able to navigate through the short form relatively easily.
    1. LIKELY TRUE: All of our participants were able to complete the application easily and without barrier
2. Users may have issues with understanding what a "short form" is.
    1. LIKELY FALSE: The majority of participants understood what a short form is and were not left with questions or concerns when reaching submission.
3. Users may have issues with understanding what is the added value of this experience (because they will not see the skipped questions)
    1. LIKELY FALSE: The majority of participants were pleasantly surprised how quick and easy the application was, even without having the experience of the full one to compare it to.
4. Users may have issues with getting stuck/confused on the confirmation page after self-reporting pay for a disability rating of 50% or higher
    1. LIKELY FALSE: All of the participants moved through the confirmation with minimal thought to it. For those who wondered why they were asked to confirm, their questions were resolved when they moved to the next page and saw the alert that they were filling out a short form.

## Recommendations

1. Implement the short form

## Next Steps

1. Design an alert for the Review page that reminds users what information they were able to skip and why
2. Update the Current compensation question messaging
3. Update the Insurance detail question messaging
4. Consider ways to update the Introduction page so that Veterans who will receive the short form will not spend unnecessary time searching for documents that they won't need
5. Update 10-10EZ question order [flows](https://www.sketch.com/s/da85cf44-4503-4e98-834e-ff068b242ef6/p/A71F1C96-FF98-42A2-9ADD-6D4B7A1DDB20) in production
6. Implement the short form for applicants with a disability rating of 50% or higher


###  In the future
* Explore alternatives of showing the repeated Introduction on sign in
* Explore ways to improve the progress bar so that it is more reflective of length and progress
* Explore other qualifying criteria (Eg. combat status) to expand the short flow experience to more Veterans
* Ask Prefered contact question, and implement email confirmation and notifications
