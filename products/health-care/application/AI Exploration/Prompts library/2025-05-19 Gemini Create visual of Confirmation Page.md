### AI Tool used
- Gemini

### Task Description
- Create a visual of the confirmation page, a user flow boxes and arrows diagram, and state the pros and cons behind each one of the 3 explorations provided

### Prompt(s) used
- GEMINI: I am a senior designer working on the health care applications on VA.gov. The team has been tasked to prototype a transition from the 10-10EZ health care benefits application to the 10-10D CHAMPVA benefits form. We want to explore ways to do that on the EZ confirmation page after submission. A Veteran needs to have a disability rating of 100% and have a qualifying spouse or dependent in order to need to complete the 10-10d. Your role is to assist with quickly prototyping 3 explorations around this. Create a visual of the confirmation page, a user flow boxes and arrows diagram, and state the pros and cons behind each one of the 3 explorations provided. Helpful information to reference for eligibility criteria on behalf of the Veteran and their spouse/dependents: https://www.va.gov/health-care/how-to-apply/ https://www.va.gov/family-and-caregiver-benefits/health-and-disability/champva/ State your confidence rating in understanding these instructions before proceeding.
