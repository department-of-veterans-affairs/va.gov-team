### Prompt(s) used
- I am a UX designer and I am investigating a user journey that connects two healthcare forms. Here is the information that I have: I will use Veteran and user interchangeably, but they will mean the same thing in this scenario. User: My user is a Veteran of the United States military. They have a 100% disability rating, which means they qualify for healthcare through the VA. Additionally, the Veteran has dependents who might qualify for CHAMPVA. Here is the site with that information: https://www.va.gov/family-and-caregiver-benefits/health-and-disability/champva/. This Veteran is filling out the 10-10EZ form. Here is a link to the staging version: https://staging.va.gov/health-care/apply-for-health-care-form-10-10ez/introduction. I have also uploaded the paper version for reference. The 10-10EZ has many pathways based on the applicant’s background. In this scenario, the user has an account on VA.gov and their identity has been verified, so we know they have a 100% disability rating. Because of this, they will fill out a shorter form, which will not include the section about dependents or finances. We tell them this from the beginning with an alert on the page. On this shorter form, the system will check their disability rating so we know that they have 100%. This Veteran will then enter their personal information, including their place of birth (city, state), their mother’s maiden name, their sex (which might be pre-filled if we know it based upon our database), their mailing address, and their home address (if it is different). The Veteran is then asked a question if they want to fill out more information about their military service, especially around potential toxic exposure. This section in optional. For the purposes of our scenario, the answer is no, they do not want to fill it out. The user moves onto the insurance information, which asks if they are eligible for Medicaid. For the purposes of our scenario, the answer is no, so they do not answer any additional questions. The Veteran does not have any additional insurance policies to add. They select their preferred VA facility, based upon their location, but do not want to be contacted for a first appointment. The Veteran reviews their information, the military service section (which does not have information in it, as they declined to answer), and their insurance information. If everything looks good, the Veteran submits.
