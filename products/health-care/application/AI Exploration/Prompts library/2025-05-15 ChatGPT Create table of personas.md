## Create table of personas

### AI Tool used
- ChatGPT

### Task Description
- Create table of personas

### Prompt(s) used
- I am a UX designer and researcher. I need to generate several unique personas of folks who are filling out VA.gov 10-10EZ health care enrollment form with 100% service-connected disability rating, and who are potentially eligible for CHAMPVA 10-10D. Research VA.gov to confirm eligibility, research into Reddit for posts around CHAMPVA, but avoid posts from official VA accounts or posts with personally identifiable information. Give me a table of potential personas.

### Other inputs (links to design files, screenshots, other files and references)
- none

### Output Summary
- 4 personas

### Output details and resources (links if applicable)

### Success Status
- Time consuming

### Evaluation Notes, if any
- It is powerful and fast but requires you to double check its answers (so that can be a time consuming process); We need it to ask for clarification and we need to ask its confidence level.
