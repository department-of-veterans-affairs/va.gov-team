## Create a prompt to for V0 to create a prototype; research V0 capabilities

### AI Tool used
- ChatGPT

### Task Description
- Create a prompt for V0 to create a prototype; research V0 capabilities

### Prompt(s) used
- To qualify for CHAMPVA, the user must be Authenticated and have 100% disability rating, therefore they do not fill out the household or financial information in the 10-10EZ.  
- ChatGPT-o3 prompt: I am using Vercel V0 to mock an interaction. First, I want you to research Vercel V0 capabilities, then help me come up with a prompt in a markdown for the V0 agent .
     - Context: This interaction will connect two online application flow on VA.gov for U.S. military Veterans. Part 1 is the 10-10EZ health-care benefits form; Part 2 is the 10-10D CHAMPVA form for dependents. In our scenario, the Veteran has a verified (authenticated) VA.gov account with a 100% disability rating and two dependents (spouse + child). But since they have 100% disability rating, they go through the 10-10EZ short form where they do not see or fill out household and financial information. In this scenario, the system does not know if the veteran have a spouse or dependents.  
     - Parameter: The interaction I want occurs inline at or after the 10-10EZ submission confirmation page. It will be a prompt, “Base on the information you provided, you may be eligibility for additional benefits through CHAMPVA”. Within the same prompt, have a link “Learn more about 10-10D CHAMPVA” which redirects to About VA Form 10-10D page. This page will have a primary button “Continue to CHAMPVA” which redirects to 10-10D CHAMPVA, a secondary link “maybe later” to close page and redirect the the main VA.gov page.  
     - Additional Information: Important for Vercel V0 prototype, I do not need to run any real API/LLM, just simulated. I’ve uploaded a screenshot of the review page and the confirmation page. Do some analysis and come up with the ideal UI. You can use the VA Design System website for ideas, you can point out actual storybook components so Vercel can recreate them. Please research all of this then create a prompt in markdown file for me afterward.  Give me your confident rating and ask clarification questions.
