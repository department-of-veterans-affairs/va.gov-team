### Prompt(s) used
- User flow for form bundling As a senior UX designer, my team and I are exploring new flows that combine forms together. Specifically the VA forms 10-10EZ health care application, 10-10CG caregiver program and the 10-10d CHAMPVA benefits. These are the personas and users involved in completing these applications: Alex – Young Post-9/11 Veteran • Injury Status: Diagnosed with PTSD and mild TBI from a 2020 deployment (meets the "serious injury or illness" criteria) • Needs: Requires daily supervision and assistance with medication and appointments • Eligible For: ◦ 10-10EZ – VA Health Care ◦ 10-10CG – Has serious post-service injuries and requires a caregiver Spouse to Alex: Mia • Relationship: Lives full-time with Alex and assists him with daily tasks • Eligibility: ◦ Meets age and relationship requirements ◦ Is eligible to apply as a Primary Family Caregiver using Form 10-10CG ◦ Will complete VA training and background check Lisa – Civilian Caregiver for Brother • Relationship: Lives with and supports her Veteran brother, diagnosed with a spinal injury post-deployment • Eligible For: ◦ Lisa herself fills out Form 10-10CG as the Primary Family Caregiver ◦ Her brother must meet criteria for serious injury, supervision needs, and service eligibility Lisa’s Brother: Thomas • Status: Veteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom, medically retired due to spinal trauma • Eligibility: ◦ Meets 10-10CG Veteran eligibility for caregiver assistance ◦ May also be eligible for VA health care via 10-10EZ Carlos – Senior Vietnam Veteran • Status: 100% service-connected disabled, Parkinson’s disease (presumed due to Agent Orange exposure) • Eligible For: ◦ 10-10EZ – VA Health Care ◦ 10-10D – CHAMPVA for spouse ◦ 10-10CG – If personal care is needed due to service-connected Parkinson’s Carlos’ Spouse: Maria • Relationship: Lives with Carlos full-time, helps with medication, mobility, and appointments • Eligibility: ◦ Meets caregiver criteria to apply via Form 10-10CG ◦ Also eligible for CHAMPVA via 10-10D, as Carlos is 100% P&T disabled Here is a possible very basic form flow outline: User Flow B: Form Selector with Progressive Disclosure Goal: Allow users to select specific forms, while still providing a seamless combined experience. Steps: 1 User Login – Access through VA.gov. Form Selection Page – Users choose: ◦ “Apply for VA Health Care” (10-10EZ) ◦  “Apply for CHAMPVA” (10-10D) ◦ “Apply for Caregiver Support” (10-10CG) 2 Prompt: Combine Forms? – If more than one selected, suggest combining into a single process. 3 Unified Wizard: ◦ Start with shared info fields ◦ Branch into form-specific sections 4 Inline Help & Logic – Show/hide sections based on responses and eligibility. 5 Review & Submit – Unified review and single submission. 6 Dashboard – Track status individually with linked resources for each benefit. Your role as a chatbot is to create a prompt to use in Figma First Draft where this user flow can be created.
