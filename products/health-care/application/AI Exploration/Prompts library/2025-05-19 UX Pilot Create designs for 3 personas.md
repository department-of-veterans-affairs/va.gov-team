### AI Tool used
- UX Pilot

### Task Description
- Create medium fidelity designs for 3 personas

### Prompt(s) used
- Create medium-fidelity designs and user flow diagrams for three explorations detailing how to transition users from the 10-10EZ health care application confirmation page to the 10-10D CHAMPVA application on VA.gov.
- Target Audience: Veterans who have completed the 10-10EZ application, some of whom may be eligible for CHAMPVA benefits.
- Design Requirements:
  - Consistency: Maintain the visual style and branding of VA.gov.
  - Accessibility: Ensure all designs are accessible to users with disabilities, adhering to WCAG guidelines.
  - Clarity: Designs should clearly communicate the information and guide users through the process.
  - Medium Fidelity: Designs should include sufficient detail to represent the layout, content, and functionality, but avoid high-fidelity visual elements like specific colors, fonts, and images. Use placeholder content and basic UI elements.

- Three Explorations:
  - **Exploration 1: Direct Link with Conditional Logic**
    - Confirmation Page Design: Show the standard 10-10EZ confirmation message. Include a section titled "Next Steps". Within "Next Steps," present a conditional statement: "If you have a 100% disability rating and a qualifying spouse or dependent, you may be eligible for CHAMPVA. [Link to 10-10D Application]". Use a prominent button or link for the CHAMPVA application.
    - User Flow Diagram: Use boxes and arrows to represent the user's path: [Start: 10-10EZ Submission] -> [Display Confirmation with CHAMPVA Link] -> [User Clicks Link] -> [10-10D Application] -> [End: 10-10D Submission]
  - **Exploration 2: Post-Submission Follow-up**
    - Confirmation Page Design: Show the standard 10-10EZ confirmation message.
    - User Flow Diagram: [Start: 10-10EZ Submission] -> [Display Standard 10-10EZ Confirmation] -> [End: 10-10EZ Submission] [Separate Process: Notification to User (Email/VA.gov)] -> [User Clicks Link in Notification] -> [10-10D Application] -> [End: 10-10D Submission]
  - **Exploration 3: Informational Prompt with Link**
    - Confirmation Page Design: Show the standard 10-10EZ confirmation message. Include a section titled "Learn About CHAMPVA". Provide a brief description of the CHAMPVA program. Include a link to the 10-10D application.
    - User Flow Diagram: [Start: 10-10EZ Submission] -> [Display Confirmation with CHAMPVA Information and Link] -> [User May Click Link] -> [10-10D Application (Optional)] -> [End: 10-10EZ Submission]

- Specific Design Elements (Medium Fidelity):
  - Layout: Use a grid system to structure the content.
  - Typography: Use a clear, sans-serif font for headings and body text. Specify font sizes and weights.
  - Buttons/Links: Use standard VA.gov button and link styles.
  - Icons: Use appropriate icons from the VA.gov design system (if available) or a standard icon library (e.g., Lucide).
  - Form Elements: Use standard form elements for the 10-10D application (if shown).
  - Placeholder Content: Use placeholder text (e.g., Lorem Ipsum) and images.
  - Annotations: Add annotations to explain design decisions and user interactions.

- Deliverables: Figma or UX Pilot file containing the medium-fidelity designs for all three explorations. Clear labeling of each exploration and its components.
- Design Considerations: How to present the CHAMPVA information in a clear and concise way. How to encourage eligible users to apply for CHAMPVA without overwhelming other users. How to ensure a smooth transition to the 10-10D application.
