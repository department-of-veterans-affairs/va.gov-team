### Success Status
- Successful

### Evaluation Notes, if any
- I did this with several different Excel files that had varying number of headings and varying amount of data.  Copilot formatted them all into markdown successfully.
- Any linked text within the Excel file did not carry over, so I had to update those manually.  Not sure how to do that through Copilot yet.
