### Prompt(s) used
- PROMPT 1 = GEMINI I am a senior designer and our team is working on a project to bundle multiple VA forms, specifically the 10-10EZ health care benefits application and the 10-10d CHAMPVA benefits when a Veteran is eligible and has dependents and/or a spouse. Attached is what the health enrollment team has explored so far. Your role is to create a low-fi wireframe clickable prototype that uses the VA.gov design system https://design.va.gov/ Update the flow so that it follows: 1. Veteran signs in, 2. Veteran is shown known information; 3. Veteran completes 10-10EZ then is prompted to complete the 10-10d if they have eligible family members. Make a clickable flow Create a prompt I can use in Figma that will create frames for each page of the application and will follow the flow: 1. Veteran signs in, 2. Veteran's information is prefilled including 100% disability rating, 3. At end of the EZ health care benefits application the Veteran is asked if they have a spouse/dependents and what to apply for CHAMPVA 10-10D  create a prompt for UX pilot to create a prototype
