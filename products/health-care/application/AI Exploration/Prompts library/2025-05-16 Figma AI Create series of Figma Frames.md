### Prompt(s) used
- PROMPT 2 = FIGMA FIRST DRAFT Figma Prompt: "Create a series of Figma frames outlining the user flow for a Veteran applying for VA Health Care (Form 10-10EZ) and potentially CHAMPVA (Form 10-10D). The frames should adhere to the VA.gov design system and include the following steps: Sign In: Frame 1: VA.gov sign-in page with options for ID.me and DS Logon. Clearly indicate this is the entry point for the application. Frame 2: (Conditional) If the user is already signed in, show a screen with a prompt:  'Welcome Back, [Veteran Name]'. Include a button to 'Continue to Application'. Information Review (Prefilled): Frame 3: Display the Veteran's prefilled information, retrieved from their VA profile. Include fields for: Full Name Date of Birth Email Address Veteran Status (with pre-selected option) Label this section 'Review Your Information' and include a short description: 'Please review the information below. You can edit it if needed.' 10-10EZ Application (Health Care): Frame 4: Start of the 10-10EZ application. Use VA.gov components for form fields. Include a clear title: 'Apply for VA Health Care (Form 10-10EZ)'. Include sections for: Personal Information Military Service Information Household Information Insurance Information Frame 5, 6, 7...: Continue breaking down the 10-10EZ form into logical sections across multiple frames, if necessary, to avoid overwhelming the user. CHAMPVA Eligibility Prompt: Frame [Number]: This frame appears after the user completes the 10-10EZ application. Include a title: 'Possible CHAMPVA Eligibility' Include a short paragraph explaining that, based on their 100% P&T disability rating, their spouse and/or dependents may be eligible for CHAMPVA benefits. Include a question: 'Do you have a spouse or dependent children you wish to enroll in CHAMPVA?' Provide 'Yes' and 'No' buttons. 10-10D Application (CHAMPVA): Frame [Number]: This frame appears only if the user answers 'Yes' to the CHAMPVA eligibility question. Include a title: 'Apply for CHAMPVA Benefits (Form 10-10D)' Prefill any information from the 10-10EZ that is also required for the 10-10D (e.g., Veteran's name, address). Indicate which fields are prefilled. Include sections for: Spouse/Dependent Information (with fields for name, SSN, DOB, relationship) Other Health Insurance Information Supporting Documentation Upload (for marriage certificate, if needed) Frame [Number+1, etc.]: Break down the 10-10D form into additional frames as needed. Review and Submit: Frame [Number]: A summary screen showing both the 10-10EZ and 10-10D applications. Clearly label each section (e.g., 'VA Health Care Application (10-10EZ)', 'CHAMPVA Application (10-10D)'). Provide a way for the user to edit information in either form. Include a prominent 'Submit All Applications' button. Confirmation and Tracking: Frame [Number]: Confirmation page after submission. Show a success message. Provide a tracking number or status for each submitted form (10-10EZ and 10-10D). Explain next steps (e.g., what to expect, how to check status). Ensure all frames use the standard VA.gov header, footer, typography, and form elements. Use a grid layout and ensure the design is responsive and accessible."
