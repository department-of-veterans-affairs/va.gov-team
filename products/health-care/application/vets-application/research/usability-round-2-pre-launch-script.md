## Objectives ##
The team will conduct sessions with 4 to 5 users to evaluate the initial healthcare application prototype. 

The purpose of each usability session is to explore: 

	1. What are participants’ first impressions of the form?
	2. Do participants understand the purpose of the form?
	3. How intuitive is the interaction and design of the form?
	4. How clear and actionable is the content and labels on the form?
	5. What aspects of the form work well (e.g., layout, design, logic, interaction features, etc.)?
	6. What difficulties (pain points) do participants encounter when using the form?
	7. Do users understand the financial disclosure section?
	8. Is the final review page clear and easy to understand?


### Welcome and Opening Remarks (5 minutes)###
*[When the participant is ready, the moderator will begin the session with the following introduction.]*

Thank you for joining us today. My name is [NAME] and we also have [NAME OF OTHERS OBSERVING] observing and taking notes for this session. We are doing this website feedback session on behalf of the team at the Department of Veterans Affairs working to build Vets.gov.  

The team wants to evaluate the some parts of the vets.gov website related to healthcare — to make sure that the site is helpful and easy to use.

In this session, I’ll ask you to look at the site with me, and give you time to freely explore and have you show me how you would use the site on your own. This will help us better understand how to make the site as easy to use and helpful as possible.

Before we begin, I’d like to make a few things clear and explain how the session will work.  

  * We aren’t testing your ability. We’re just trying to figure out what works well on the website, and what doesn’t work well. So there are no right or wrong answers. We just want to hear your opinions and what you think so that we can make the site better. I won’t be offended by any opinions you express.  
  * This entire usability test session should take about 45 minutes or less. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally interrupt you to move on to the next question or task.  
  * We’ll be recording the screen activities as we look at the site. Recording our discussion today will help us capture everything you say accurately.  
  * If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop. 
  * As we're going through the session, I'd like you to think out loud....this means say whatever you're thinking or feeling, and also give me a narrative or story as you are clicking on things. So as your clicking you might say something like "now I'm going to hit this blue button because it says start. It took me to a new page. This is what I expected. I'm going to scroll to the bottom.." etc   

Do you have any questions at this stage?

Do you understand everything I said and agree to participate?

*[The moderator will begin audio and screen recording.]*

### Warm-up Questions (5 minutes)###
Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.  

  * Tell me about the last time that you accessed a service from the VA. 
  * [If participant doesn't mention healthcare, ask:] Do you use VA healthcare? How long have you had it? Do you remember what it was like when you signed up?
  * What other services have you used from the VA? [PROMPT: GI Bill? Disability benefits? Healthcare?]  
  * Where do you usually go if you have a question about services available to you as a veteran from the VA?  
    * Do you ever go online for this information? If so, what websites do you usually go to?


### Healthcare App (15 minutes)###

[Moderator pulls up staging link] 

#### First Impressions of Landing Page ####
First I’m going to ask you to take a look and tell me what you think about this website. You can scroll if you want to, but don’t click anything yet. Just talk me through what you see and what you notice as you look at the page. After, I’ll ask you a few questions. 

	•What are your first impressions?  
	•What do you notice first?  
	•What do you like/dislike? Why?  
	•Where would you want to click first? Why?  
	  *Go ahead and click on it. Is that what you expected to see?  

#### Task 1: Apply for Healthcare ####
This site is still a draft, so if something doesn't work - just tell me what you thought might happen. 

Imagine you need to get healthcare from the VA. Please use this site to sign up for VA healthcare for yourself. Use the site like you would normally if you just found it --  pretend like I’m not here. Feel free to use fake information if it asks for something that you don't want to share with me (like your social security number).

Reminder: as you’re looking through the site I’d like you to think out loud. So this means that you say whatever you’re thinking or feeling like, “Oh that’s interesting” or “Hm. That’s not what I thought would happen.”  After you explore the site, we’ll talk about what you looked at. 

*[Moderator allows the participant to explore the site on his or her own for 5 to 8 minutes and then asks the following questions, as well as other questions related to specific issues noted during observation.]* 

	•What do you think you might use this website for?  
	•Do you think this information is trustworthy and reliable? Why or why not?  
	•How easy or hard is it to use this site?  
	•Is there anything that could have made it easier?  
	•Is there anything that is confusing or unclear? Why?  
	•Is there anything you would do to improve this site or make it more useful to you? What?  
	
**Content related questions:**
  * If you had to explain this to a friend, what would you say?  
  * How does this information make you feel? 
  * What is the most important information on this page? 
  * What is the least important?
  

##### Sub-tasks:
1. [To test the review page] Now that you're at the end, let's say that you realized you typed in your social security number wrong. Can you show me how you would fix it?

**Things to watch for:**

* Clicking on Navigation
* Form Validation Errors 
* Form Logic
* Labeling
* Information hierarchy of the form
* Insurance information - is this confusing?
* Financial Assessment/Financial Disclosure - is this confusing?
* How do they go back to make edits?
* Final page - how would they expect to review?



### Post-Task Interview (5 minutes)###
Now that you’ve had a chance to explore the site, I’m going to ask you a few final questions. Some of these questions I’ve already asked you, but I want to ask them again, now that you’ve seen the website.  

	•After seeing this site, what do you think the main purpose is?  
	•Who’s the site for? What makes you think that?  
	•What do you like most about this website? What do you disklike?  
	•Would you use this website in real life? Why or why not?  
	•Do you have any comments or final thoughts about this website?  

### Thank-You and Closing ###
