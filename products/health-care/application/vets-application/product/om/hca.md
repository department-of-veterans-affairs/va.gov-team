# Vets.gov Product Specific Operations and Maintenance Plan

Vets.gov will interface with the healthcare Enrollment System (ES) to support 1010EZ submission. This document lays out that operations and maintenance relationship between those systems to support a positive Veteran experience.

The overall relationship between vets.gov and the VA stakeholders and systems will be governed by the relevant vets.gov product charter. This document should not supersede any items already established in the charter.

## Customer Support

Vets.gov is supported by the Health Resource Center (HRC) customer support center, which provides phone, email, and eventually chat support. HRC provides all Tier 1 support for vets.gov features and functionality. HRC also provides support for the legacy Veterans Online Application healthcare enrollment process.

All vets.gov ticket will be routed from HRC to vets.gov for triage. Vets.gov will provide operations and maintenance for vets.gov infrastructure and application break/fix only. If the customer issue is not directly related to vets.gov infrastructure or application code, then the issue will be routed to the ES support for Tier 2/3 support on their end.

### Trouble Ticketing Software

Vets.gov will use the NSD SDM issue ticketing system to handle user reported issues to HRC with an expected transition to Microsoft Dynamics when it becomes available. At this time, ES is not planned to be given direct access to the vets.gov ticketing system. There is currently a regular phone call on which trouble issues are discussed and raised for ES action and follow-up.


## Operational monitoring

Each system will monitor its system's operations, performance, and connectivity in accordance with its own standard operating procedures. That information will be made available to the other system on an as needed basis for troubleshooting or incident response using the escalation procedures for Tier 2+ issues noted above.

In addition, ES will provide daily reporting of submissions counts and status to vets.gov to support our reporting requirements.
