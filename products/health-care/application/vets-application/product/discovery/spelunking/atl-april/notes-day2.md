OPPORTUNITY: separate application and eligibility needs // registration

# 9am: Corrie, Magda


# 9am: LeRoy

# 11am: Lorelle, Elizabeth, Chris
Focus of this meeting was on understanding the manual process related to unverified applications. 
+ each morning the Enrollment System generates a list of enrollments (ADR – automated data repository) 
+ list is manually reviewed by management analyst 
    + this generates an email from informatics team 
+ anything that is not “verified” is pulled out manually and inputted into WRAP 
+ analyst (of which there is 1...) manually tracks down the record
+ if nothing is found, they generate a pending letter 

### what ends up NOT verified?
-	means test 
-	purple heart 
-	outright rejections 

### are there any errors that are preventable? 
-	leaving a spouse off  (incorrect financials) 
-	confuse it with medicade (PG 5)  
    + you need to provide medicade proof
    + backbilled  
-	clarity on what “service-connected” means 
    + 10% or greater AND compensable (incurred or aggravated) 
- financial assessment 
-	general input errors (review feature) 

### what's behind the submission errors? (talk to Mehedi) 
-	characters 
-	“hung up in transmission” 

### what is the MVI issue? 
-	new registration >> check ES to avoid duplicate >> queries MVI >> 

### % that are POA?

### Ideal
-	already verified --- as automated as possible 
-	able to attach documents 

- about 30% w/o DD214s don’t send it in… 
-	WW2 generally have them 
-	Vietnam generally don’t 
-	DPRS (defense personelle retrieval system)

2011 version was different – 2015 cut out a bunch of information


# 1pm: Dane 

-	design of the system is weak…  
-	what actually CAUSED the enrollment? 
    + NON-PENDING enrollment decision was made 
-	About 2 minutes to process 
-	VOA doesn’t feed into a workload – feeds into the ES and then enrollments are batched 
-	Not all submissions through VOA are NEW… many are updates? (about 50%) 
-	Updates… ES doesn’t know what they were trying to update (have to cross-reference all the data fields) EVERYTHING gets resubmitted. 
-	“there’s a lot of noise in the enrollment system” 
-	130 VISTA systems … in the field 
-	most of the work is currently done in Vista… (~75% walk into a VAMC) 
-	ES doesn’t capture the application method 
-	Transmission failures b/w Vista 
-	Submission failures (10-20%)  78 submissions yesterday, 58
    + Never been below 10% 
-	We collect more information than we need 
    + We need basic demo… 
    + We GET the mil serv data – we don’t use anything else from the military service
-	“they explain all the inefficiencies away… the fact that they understand it, is part of the problem.” 
-	There’s a belief that a lot of things happen automatically. 
-	Assumption that there is follow-up… once it’s in pending, it’s just sitting there… there’s some pilot work happening for case-management 
-	If it takes more than 1 day, forget about it… pending… 
    + we either need 1 day, or forget it
    + what would a veteran need to do to follow up… call and find out what is missing… 
-	Most veterans DO need to submit additional information… (what 
-	PGs 1, 2, 3, most 4s, 6s… should be able to be automated
-	About 50% of vets applying for HC are already in the VBA system 
-	Biggest obstacles is Veteran verification (“there’s a long list of systems… probably at least 10, and each one is good for different types of Veterans.”) 

_“we design a lot of these systems for US instead of the customer…”_

combat veteran “clean-up” project 

+ Are you Veteran?
+ Are you service-disabled?  **
    + What % 
    + [query VBA] 
    + most combat vets 
+ Military service qualifications? 
+ Financial…? 
+ Attach supporting documentation? 


WANTS
+ Better systems to confirm military service 
    + MSDS is good for recent veterans 
+ Ability to attach DD214
