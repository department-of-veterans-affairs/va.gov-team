This is an email that I sent to Matt, Ryan, Jim, and Amber on the 23rd. It proposes a clear path forward for the "futures" team to ensure that they are (1) all aligned, and (2) that the future state is rooted in the needs of users. 

## Email to Futures team

Matt and Ryan,

Thanks for taking the time to meet on Friday. Below is a quick recap of our conversation:

We discussed what a good approach to identifying and rolling out a future state might look like over the next few months. We seemed to be in agreement that we could use the 3-month planning phase of the ESM contract to do (1) an audit of all work currently underway related to the Enrollment process, and (2) discovery for the C4C program.

# PROPOSAL
Use the next three months to do “future state planning” and focus on three workstreams:

### 1. ESM CONTRACT 
This is the standard planning phase for the contract. 

> Purpose: Ensure that this planning phase is done in a user-centered manner, and that requirements are based on user needs rather than business assumptions.

QUESTIONS THIS SHOULD ANSWER: 
+ what is the future state we want for the ES? 
+ what is the best way to scope this contract to achieve that state?

OUTPUT: effective scope, requirements, and execution plan for the contract

### 2. AUDIT. 
There are a number of balls in the air on enrollment. Some of which we are aware, others of which we are not. An audit should be done to ensure that leadership has a clear picture of the entire universe of work related to the future of enrollment. This is important for two reasons (1) it prevents duplicative, disruptive and/or conflicting work, and (2) it is an opportunity to identify resources that might be better allocated or repurposed.

QUESTION THIS SHOULD ANSWER: what is the universe of work occurring and how can it best map to our desired future state?

OUTPUT: A list of all programs, projects, contracts, etc… working on anything touching enrollment. This should include an understanding of the people, projects, goals, contractors, and $$ involved.

### 3. DISCOVERY for future state. 
This would be a blue-sky discovery phase aimed at capitalizing on the moment of transition, ensuring that veterans have a seamless transition from DoD to VA when it comes to their healthcare. The main purpose of this would be to identify the best way to capture veterans as they transition.

QUESTION THIS SHOULD ANSWER: what is the best way to capture Veterans as they transition out of service?

OUTPUT: Vision for future state and transition 

## TIMING
This should take approximately 3 months (total) and coincide directly with the planning period of the ESM contract. As a result, no timelines move—we just use the time to validate assumptions, and craft a clear future-state vision for the entire Enrollment process.

## OUTPUTS
By the end of this three month period, you should have:
1.	A clear vision of the future of enrollment that can be shared with all, ensuring alignment of purpose and goals. Everyone doing work on enrollment should be working toward this future state (or, at the very least, not doing any work that will get in the way)
2.	an effective contract scope and requirements that will yield the ES you need for the future state.
