To apply for healthcare, a Veteran must complete and submit a form called the 10-10EZ. VOA (the Veterans Online Application) was created in 2012 to allow Veterans to submit their application online. Only about 1% of applications come through VOA. 

VOA is a general term for the platform used to apply for healthcare through at least 8 different versions of the 10-10 form: 

### 1. 10-10EZ

+ core, foundational form
+ used for 1st time applications 
+ main workflow on Veteran-facing VOA 

### 2. 10-10EZR

+ used to update application
+ secondary workflow on Veteran-facing VOA

### 3. 10-10AD 

+ used to apply while still on active duty (often during a TAP class)
+ secondary workflow on Veteran-facing VOA 

### 4. 10-10JO

+ used to process Veterans at Justice Courts
+ on-site only @ Courts

### 5. 10-10Demob
+ used to process Veterans at “demobilization units” 
+ on-site only @ specific military bases 

### 6. 10-10BP
+ used to process Veterans via VBA 
+ unclear where this is located 

### 7. 10-10CG
+ used to process Veterans by caregivers
+ unclear if this is location-specific, but it is used by caregiver support staff 

### 8. 10-10SH
+ used to process Veterans who are in special care (hospice or mental health facilities)
+ specific to locations 

Only 3 of these workflows are Veteran-facing. The rest are specialized iterations of the 10-10EZ that were created for specific contexts, and are largely used by 3rd parties to help Veterans apply for healthcare in specific (often sensitive) contexts: 

## The Product
VOA is a fillable + submittable PDF that dumps data into the Enrollment System (ES) at the Health Eligibility Center (HEC). It has 3 workflows:

### 1. ENROLL. 
This is the workflow for 1st time enrollment 
-	Form: 10-10EZ

### 2.	UPDATE. 
This is the workflow for updating your application. It requires you to pull up the form again, make the changes you want, and resubmit. 
-	Form: 10-10EZR

### 3.	SEPARATING FROM ACTIVE DUTY. 
This is the workflow for applying while you are still in service / on active duty. This often occurs at a TAP class. 
-	Form: 10-10AD 

A different version of this product exists for each of the remaining 5 workflows. All data from all the versions of VOA is dumped into the same pipeline, and pushed into the Enrollment System, where business logic/rules are applied and data is validated against approximately 13 different data-bases. 

## Validation
According to the VOA team there are 13 that are involved in validation. So far I know of 3 items that need to be validated and the databases they call… 
-	Master Veteran Index (DoD) 
-	Identity 
-	Record locator 
-	VHA
-	ADR
-	VBA
-	LGY
-	SGLY
-	CORP
-	BIRLS (?) 
-	NCA 
-	BOSS 
-	AMAS
-	BVA (not sure which one) 
-	SSA 

## A brief history of the 10-10EZ + VOA
The 10-10EZ existed in paper form only until 2003. In 2003, the form was “digitized” — this meant it became accessible (but not submittable) online. It went through a number of “digital” iterations, and in 2012 VOA was developed to make it possible to actually SUBMIT the application online. 

+ 2003: DIGITIZED
    -	Find it online
    - Print it 
    - Fill it out
    -	Mail it to your preferred facility

+ FILLABLE
    - Find it online
    -	Fill it out online
    -	Print it
    -	Mail it to your preferred facility

+ SAVEABLE
this included a transition from a very long form to a shorter one 
    -	Find it online
    -	Fill it out
    -	Save it + work on it more later
    -	Print it
    -	Mail it to your preferred facility

+ 2012: SUBMITTABLE (this is VOA)  
This became possible because the requirement for a “wet signature” was removed (hitting “submit” was defined as a signature) 
   -	Find it online
    -	Fill it out
    -	Save it + work on it more later
    - Submit online
