Applications are currently mandated to come through the 10-10EZ form either in paper form, or through the “digital platform” called VOA. Though VOA has been online since 2012, only about 1% of applications come through it. This means that 99% of applications come via paper through local facilities across the country, which is a highly decentralized process. 

The aim of NEI efforts this year is to create a centralized application process. Our role in this effort is to create a more useable interface for Veterans. 

Eligibility is determined by a minimum # of required fields (need to find out what these are). These are the ONLY things that are legally required to enroll a Veteran for healthcare—everything else has been added on over the years by various business lines. 

In the short-term we are obliged to mirror the 10-10EZ and collect the exact same form-fields on vets.gov, but in the near future we will be able to collect only the minimum fields required. 

## Current State (Paper + VOA) 

Veterans can apply for healthcare via paper or digitally. Virtually no applications come through digitally—almost all of them come through the [highly decentralized] paper process. 

### PAPER PROCESS (99% of applications) 
1.	Complete and submit a form called the 10-10EZ. 
2.	That form is then snail-mailed (or dropped off) at the Veteran’s preferred medical facility
3.	That medical facility processes the application via the Eligibility System (at the HEC). 

This is a highly decentralized system, and has led to current backlog. 

### DIGITAL PROCESS (1% of applications) 
1.	Go to VOA
2.	Fill out and submit form online
3.	Data is dropped into the Eligibility System (at the HEC) 
4.	That medical facility processes the application via the Eligibility System (at the HEC).

## Future State (vets.gov + phone) 
The NEI team aims to completely eliminate the decentralized process and replace it with a streamlined application that can be submitted in 1 of two ways:
1.	via the application we are creating on vets.gov 
2.	over the phone (assisted digital) where the call centers will use the application on vets.gov to sign callers up for healthcare 

Our (DS) efforts between now and MAY 30th are laser-focused on developing a usable front end for this process, that will replace “VOA”—the product that 1% of applicants use to submit the 10-10EZ online. 

# QUESTIONS
+ what does the actual processing of the application entail? 
+ how is processing at a facility different than the HEC?
+ how do applications that start at a facility end up at the HEC?
