*Brief for Joan justifying / explaining our decision to delay launch.*

Through our work to migrate VOA to vets.gov, in collaboration with Joan Hall and her program office, we have made a discovery that has led us to recommend that we should postpone launch from November 25 to December 30, 2015.

In short, the discovery is this: *the function for opening the VOA PDF in a browser does not work for a vast majority of users.* 

This issue is not new. It is known by the product team that the PDF returns an error message when using Firefox, Chrome, and Safari—according to analytics.gov, these three browsers make up 71% of government web traffic. This means that nearly ¾ of users trying to apply for health care via the “guest access” feature are getting an error message. 

The issue is currently described by the product team as a “problem with the browser, not with the PDF.” While it is true that the problem is a result of browser incompatibility, it is not true that the problem lies with the browsers. Our products should be compatible with modern browsers—especially those used by the vast majority (71%) of our customers.

The current remediation of the problem is to describe to users how to go into their browsers and change the settings to allow the download. This is a bad user experience. No good product should require this much action on the part of a user for the product to function.  

With vets.gov dedicated to a positive user experience, we believe that the risk of a bad user experience with this tool in its current form is too high to launch this week, as planned. 

We recommend the following:
+ Postpone launch to the end of December
+ Build a small and agile team to transform the PDF into an HTML form that can live on vets.gov (this was the long-term plan for VOA anyway, so we would simply be skipping the intermediate step) 
+ Work closely with the backend team in OI&T to ensure integration between the front and back end, and collaborate with the National Enrollment Improvement Team, Benita Miller (HEC), and Sherry Williams (EED)
+ Centralize ownership of VOA to Joan Hall
