Red Flags, February 2016. 

~~Much has happened in the last few days that has led me to decide to postpone my trip to Atlanta.~~ [ended up going to ATL, as a result of a conversation with Nick Bales, in which we quickly recognized that we should be in lock step and needed to meet ASAP]

I wanted to make sure it is clear what led me to make this decision, and what would be helpful moving forward.

### 1. After a number of planning meetings for my visit to ATL next, it has become clear to me that there is actually no clear ownership of VOA on the program/business side. 

Joan Hall is the person we were instructed to work with. She has been fantastic to work with, and together we have made much headway. However there seem to be numerous competing "leads" on VOA, including:

+ Matt Eitutis and Nick Bales (on the program side)
+ the HEC leadership 
+ Brad Radichel + Laura Prietula 

This has lead to a situation in which it is unclear who is leading, and factions that seem to be working against each other. This makes it nearly impossible for my team to work effectively, as no matter who we speak with we seem to be disconnected from the leadership on their end. 

Most recently, Nick was put "in charge" of VOA. I have yet to speak with this person. 

NEED: one SINGLE person to be assigned responsible for VOA, and for them to be our direct point of contact and champion. Without this, I am not sure we will be able to succeed. 

**RESOLUTION: Matt and his team are responsible for VOA. Nick is my POC.** 

~~Once this person is identified, we need them to be engaged and at the very least have a clear understanding of our role and the plan for migrating VOA to Vets.gov.~~ [this has occured] 


### 2. Matt Eitutis and Nick Bales do not seem to understand the plan for migrating VOA to Vets.gov 

This is likely because three month into our work, they have still (1) not signed our Charter, and (2) not met with us. 

This is a worrying indication to me that Matt and Nick do not understand what we are doing and how it fits into the broader picture. 

Every time we start an engagement we sign a high-level Charter with the Business owner that lays out the problem we are trying to solve and how we intend to solve it. We began working on this in November 2015, and the work escalated when we uncovered that the form actually wasn't working for nearly 75% of web traffic. We didn't sign a Charter originally because of the pressing need to move forward. But now, nearly three months later, we need assurances that VOA leadership understands what we are doing and how it fits in with their larger vision.

I have heard numerous off-hand comments about how we are behind schedule, and that "vets.gov is not ready." This is categorically inaccurate. We are very much ahead of schedule and in keeping with our plan and timeline that is laid out in our Charter. 

NEED: A signed Charter, and engagement on the part of whoever is leading VOA--whether that be Matt or Nick. 

**RESOLUTION: ATL was a breakthrough visit, leading me and Joe to link up closely with Nick and team. We will have a Charter finalized and signed by 2/22/16.** 

### 3. Our trip to ATL was planned around Matt's availability. He changed his plans to come to DC to brief the DepSec and did not inform any of us that he was not going to be in ATL for the demo. 

Ultimately, the problem we see boils down to:
~~(1) a lack of clarity around ownership--there are many competing factions, and no single owner~~ [this is now clear: owner is Matt]
~~(2) a lack of partnership with the product owner, which makes it nearly impossible for us to make progress~~ [this now exists. we are directly connected to Matt and work daily with Nick. we are also in all the DepSec meetings about the all things VOA.]

~~As a result, I do not think it would be wise for us to continue our work on VOA (or go to ATL) until at the very least have clarity on who is in charge of VOA and who we should be working with.~~ [Glad we reversed the decision. Talking to Nick was helpful, and we realized that we shoudl be working very closely together. ATL solidified this further.]
