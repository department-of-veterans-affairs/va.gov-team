## On-going healthcare app maintenance to return DS developer resources to engineering

## Objective: to ensure every veteran gets through VA processing; to steward each veteran through the entire process or applying for healthcare 

## A. 3 areas to focus on:
1. Tracking submission IDs
2. Call center feedback
3. Web Analytics via Google Analytics

## 1. Tracking submission IDs
- Submission ID indicates received submission
- Pull new submission IDs through vets.gov to identify whether they were processed properly: did submissions get processed in the enrollment center or elsewhere?

## 2. Call center feedback
- Follow up with Kelly
- How many calls, types of calls, feedback since launch
- Sheila's call center is receiving the HCA calls

## 3. Google Analytics
- How to start measuring what's working, what is not

## B. Background with Anne
- June 30 - July 1: 102 HCA submissions, 46 processed, 56 didn't get through
  - Try to understand where the 56 are getting stuck, whether from the app and how it's sending data or from the back end system errors
  - HCA: need to build a new UI
- Partners: Chris Hawkins, Mehedi, Dane. Daily check-ins currently scheduled
- There are many back-end calls to confirm eligibility. If can't confirm, a pending status results and the app directs the veteran to call
  - If the app goes through the first staging, the veteran will get a Complete; if not, the veteran gets a Pending status and a phone number
