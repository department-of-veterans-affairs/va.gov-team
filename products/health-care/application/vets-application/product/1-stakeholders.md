The team we work directly with, and that the DepSec interacts with is the NEI = National Enrollment Improvement 
This is a group of detailees, currently led by Matt Eiutitis. This team is charged with completely overhauling the enrollment system. It was created in response to an IG report that revealed this issues with the HEC and the backlog. There are about 7 different projects that fall under NEI. Replacing VOA is one of them. 

Main people: 
•	Matt Eitutis (lead) 
•	Nick Bales (call center lead and our POC)
•	Nick Spangtos
•	Joan Hall 

Almost everyone at NEI (and who we work with) is part of an office called “Member Services”, which resides in the “Chief Business Office” – also known as the CBO – at VHA. CBO is split into 4 main offices:
1.	Member Services  
2.	PC ? 
3.	RO ?
4.	BP ? 

Member Services is led by a woman named Laura Black and used to be made up by 2 offices:
1.	HRC (Health Resource Center)
2.	HEC (Health Eligibility Center)

It was recently “reorged” into 5 offices:
1.	HRC (led by Matt Eitutis)
2.	HEC (led by Tony G) 
3.	VTP (led by David Riley) – team that runs transportation to/from health facilitites 
4.	VPS (led by Mike Davis) – team that runs kiosks 
5.	CSM 

The two teams we work with are the HRC and the HEC.  

## HEC = Health Enrollment Center
This is the entity that processes the applications, and where the backlog resides. It was the focus of the IG report, and since then there has been a tremendous amount of turnover. The main people there are: 

+ Ralph (Jim) Weishaar: Acting director
+ Erica: Deputy Director (she seems awesome and really knowledgeable) 
+ Leroy Garcia: AD, IVD
+ Lorelle Cannon: AD, EED
+ Sherry Williams, AD, QTD
+ Dane Cornelius: AD, Informatics 
+ VACANT: AD, BSD 
+ Venis Whitfield: AD, MBS
+ Magda-Rios Bynum: Program Specialist 

This is where the most turnover has occurred, and where the most toxic individuals are located. 

## HRC = Health Resource Center
Not quite clear on this group yet, but it is the group that Matt and Nick came from. I think this is largely connected to call centers, but need to confirm role in the NEI work.
