These are the notes from the "Enrollment System Mondernization Contract Briefing"

# OVERVIEW 
Contractor is Systems Made Simple _A Lockheed Martin Company_ 

I am cautiously optimistic about them. They seem to have legit staff (UX researchers, interaction designers, etc...) 

### AGENDA
1. PoCs
2. Deliverable 30 days out
3. Contract Summary
4. VA on-boarding status 
5. PMAS/VIP transition
6. Option 1 tast (ESM + Choice)
7. Risks + Issues 
8. Working Session

### VA GOALS
Overall, we are looking for agreement and CLARITY. Specifically, clarity on: 

1. decrease the burden on the Veteran
2. share data properly across the agency
3. build a system that reflects and supports the future state 
4. ensure the right people have fed into 

> Gerry Lowe: "this is one of the highest priorities at the VA--treat it that way." 

# PoCs

### Main Business Lines / VA Partners 
+ HRC 
+ HEC
+ Community Care 

+ RDM has been developing "epics" and "user stories" 
+ Mitre is helping getting epics and user stories into "optional tasks" 

# Contract summary 
+ Firm fixed price 
+ Total contract value = $33,301,475.20
+ Base period (3 months) = $496,655.22
+ Option periods (3) = $9,219,921.72
    + $3,099,443.76 
    + $3,037,723.44 
    + $3,082,754.52
+ Unfunded = about $6,120,477.96

HIGHLIGHTS
+ This is a LOT more $ than they had originally stated... 
+ Most of this contract is unfunded ($23,584,891.00) 
+ Optional Tasks are split into "A" and "B"
    + A = Enrollment System
    + B = Vista 
+ "Critical start date" = August 12
+ "Critical deliverable" = December 
+ CD 1 = July 20th = $$ goes out

# 90 day base period

1. PROJECT MANAGEMENT  

+ PMP
+ kickoff meeting 
+ quarterly progress reports
+ integrated master schedule
+ VA training
+ Risk management plan
+ project risks/issues 
+ change and config management plan
+ change management metric report 

2. ARCHITECTURE AND SYSTEMS ROADMAP ANALYSIS 

+ portfolio backlog
+ technical roadmap
+ RSD
+ SDD
+ partner integration guide

# FUTURES (Jim + Amber)

1. Transitioning Service Members 

+ current process is really passive -- we want to move toward a proactive state that is capturing Veterans as they leave service.
+ once enrolled, "welcome to VA campaign" kicks in
+ veteran gets a call to schedule an appointment 

2. ALREADY OUT 

+ automatic adjudication
+ decrease the burden--provide minimal information 
+ solid and functional integration points with IRS, SSA, DoD, etc... to get data in realtime
+ API-first 
+ complex cases still need 

# OPPORTUNITIES
+ Influence / help design their UX research plan (get MAP on board) 
+ Provide recommendations from our team
+ Connect them to the DS so we can advocate for sanity 

# FLAGS / RISKS 
+ scrum teams are not prioritizing their own sprints 
+ there is no product lead... 
+ Brad being involved and providing any level of guidance
+ Vista / mumps work... 
+ Income Verification Matching scrum team should be part of ES team
+ VOA scrum team is unnecessary -- _this will be generalized to cover all online application things_
