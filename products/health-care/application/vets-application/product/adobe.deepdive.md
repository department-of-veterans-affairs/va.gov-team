# OVERVIEW
+ flat PDF 
+ using the same underlying schema for all fields
+ data is being saved server-side if the user has an account 
+ livecycle functionality is intended for VA employees to convert PDF forms to HTML5
+ new app would save data locally, enabling users to fill it out offline and/or partially 

2 main streams of work underway:
+ IMMEDIATE: PDF to HTML conversion (direct conversion. PDF has to be built with HTML in mind) 
+ LONGER TERM: Converting PDF to a responsive form (not a direct converstion) -- drag and drop

CONTRACT
+ contract with .... not sure -- they will put us in touch 
+ don't charge by users--charge by CPU
+ perpetual model (so they can renew anytime) 

# OBSERVATIONS
+ 16 second load time
+ showing us PDF in a browser and calling it HTML??? 

Key take-aways 
+ not sure if this is going to be compatible with vets.gov the way we want it to be 
+ the responsive form is actually (visually) really nice 

# Questions for next time
+ how would absorbing this into vets.gov work? is this something we can and/or should pursue? 
+ what other tools allow the same functionality? (typeform) 
+ 5 years down the road for vets.gov? 
+ what's the plan/vision for vets.gov? 

# OPTIONS

### OPTION A: No Adobe
PROS
+ costs are lower
+ untethered to a specific tool -- flexible to change down the road 
+ technical barrier ensures quality / consistency

CONS
+ need a dev team to make changes 

### OPTION B: Adobe

PROS
+ modifying a form is super easy -- content only -- non-technical people can use it
+ nice look/feel

CONS 
+ it's an additional tool
+ we are putting all our eggs in the Adobe basket
+ lose quality control down the road b/c business owners 
+ they haven't rolled this out to the world--we don't want to be their guinea pig 


> Conclusion: Having this functionality may be helpful in the short-term, but ultimately our path forward will depend on the larger context of vets.gov (dev support, CMS, sustainability 5 years out)
