No immediate questions. We may follow up later on as we’re scoping the HCA work planned for the spring if any questions come up.

Got it. Seems reasonable enough to me. Matt/Samara, any questions on this?

Hi Joan and Josh,
 
Matt Self, CCed, is our product owner for the HCA. That said, the HCA is just a very small part of the team’s portfolio, and so for better or worse enhancement requests need to be weighed against other work on the team’s plate. We don’t have a formal intake process for new work yet, but we’re working on it and should have something cleared up in that regard in the next couple months.
 
In this specific instance, as you know, we’re doing a round of HCA work regarding anonymous and repeat HCAs early in 2019, and it’s possible we can sneak this fix in while we’re doing that other work, depending on the level of effort required. Can you provide some more information about exactly what this fix would entail, what the human impact would be, and what the reason is for the change – i.e. is there a bug at present, did the rules surrounding applications change, etc.?
 
I’d also add, since we will be doing this cycle of HCA work soon, it would probably be a good idea to throw out an open call to HEC or anyone else relevant for other bug fixes or enhancements that have been sitting around for a while. Again, no guarantee that we can get to them all now, but if we can fold some into the work we’re already doing, it could save all of us time down the line. Feel free to throw ideas my way (CCing Matt), again including the exact changes required, the impact, and the reasoning, and I’ll see if we can fit anything else into our upcoming round of work.
 
Thanks,
Gabriel

Subject: POC for updating the Future Separation Date on HCA
 
Hi Gabriel,
ES business owners are requesting a change to the allowable future date range that can be entered on the HCA for a future separation date from 2 years to 1 year in the future. 
 
Joan is looking for a POC or an intake process for how to ask for that change to be made on the HCA field validation. 
Can you help?
