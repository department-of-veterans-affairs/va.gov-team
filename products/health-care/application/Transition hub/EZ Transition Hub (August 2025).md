## **Product context**
The 10-10EZ: Application for VA health care was one of the first applications to be adapted for online use on VA.gov. Our ongoing work focuses on continuously improving its user experience (UX) and functionality to better serve Veterans.

* Used by Veterans to apply for health care.
* Averaging 20,000 submissions per month.
* Users can log into their VA.gov account (authenticate), but a VA.gov account is not required.
    * Users who have a VA.gov account must log in.
    * Some fields are prefilled for authenticated users.
    * Authenticated users can "save in progress" and return to complete their application.

## **Roadmap**
This roadmap reflects current priorities and efforts for the 10-10EZ application as of June 2025, based on the latest priority list.

**Now (Active Development/Discovery):**
* **Submission Traceability:** Ongoing Proof of Concept (POC) with the Submission Tracking (ST) team to enhance visibility into application submission statuses.
* **Form Statuses:** Active discovery phase led by the Product Manager to define and implement clear statuses for submitted applications.
* **Choose Your Own Adventure (step toward 1-click):** Research planning is in progress for this initiative, aiming to streamline the application process.
* **Multi-form Completion:** Exploration is underway with the Benefits Delivery System (BDS) team to understand possibilities for completing multiple forms.

**Next (Planned / Blocked with known dependencies):**
* **Unhoused/No Address:** This initiative is currently blocked, pending the development and availability of a new VES (Veteran Eligibility Services) REST API.
* **Confirmation Emails:** Currently blocked, pending prioritization from the VES team for implementation of confirmation email functionality.


**Future (Long-term Vision / To be prioritized):**
* **Short Form - 1-click:** Full implementation of a simplified 1-click short form, building on the 'Choose Your Own Adventure' discovery. This is a significant long-term goal.
* **Mobile App Integration:** Further exploration is needed to determine additional integration points beyond the current link on the mobile app.
