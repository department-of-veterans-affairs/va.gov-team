## Feature background

There are still Veterans either not completing the application due to additional information that is required but may not be necessary; or may not be completing due to the amount of time required to complete the application. Expanding access to the short form will remove questions that are not necessary for more circumstances, and reduce the amount of time and effort required to complete the initial form.

## Process milestones
Include notes about which Platform process was in use when this feature was in design and development.

- Ongoing discussions with HEC Leadership on how best to expand Short Form flow eligibility
- We have been trying to re-start conversations on this topic, but have been largely ignored, and now the project lead has left which leaves a gap in communications with the HEC leadership team.
