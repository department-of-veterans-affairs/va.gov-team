## Feature background
HEC team would like an input field added for Medicare claim number to be a conditional question for appicants who answer "yes" to having Medicare.

**What we know:**

– Claim number is 11 digits and made up only of numbers and uppercase letters (no special characters)

– What is the claim number used for? 
     - VA uses the claim number to create and Explanation of Benefits, known as Medicare Remittance Advice, outlining what Medicare would have paid VA if Medicare would not prohibited by law from paying for health care services provided by the VA to eligible Veterans. The MRA is used by VA to create a secondary bill to those carriers that require an EOB from Medicare prior to making payment.
