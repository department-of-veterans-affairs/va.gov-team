## Feature background
User story: As an authenticated veteran, I want to receive reminder and confirmation notifications on my application, in order to complete or confirm that I have completed my application.

This team met with the VANotify team 2 times. We found out that we should first start with submission confirmation email and then implement reminder notifications (cadence TBD). They have email templates.

**Note:** We can't require email or phone number
