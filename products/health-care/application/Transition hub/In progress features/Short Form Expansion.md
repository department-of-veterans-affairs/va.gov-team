## Feature background

There are still Veterans either not completing the application due to additional information that is required but may not be necessary; or may not be completing due to the amount of time required to complete the application. Expanding access to the short form will remove questions that are not necessary for more circumstances, and reduce the amount of time and effort required to complete the initial form.
