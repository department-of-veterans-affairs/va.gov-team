## Feature background
The purpose of this enhancement is to improve the user experience of selecting a VA facility on VA Form 10-10EZ. Since the health care application is often Veterans' first interaction with the VA, many don't know which facility is closest/most convenient for them.

**Note:** This facility search functionality is envisioned to also be [implemented in the 10-10CG](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/Transition%20hub/In%20progress%20features/Facility%20selection.md).

**Problems with current experience**
1. Those living near a state border may need to go to a facility in a different state
2. Some Veterans are not familiar with the names of VA facilities and would like to search by location without leaving the application flow

## UX research 
The design is ready, but because of the complexity of this feature, we plan to conduct usability research once in staging (rather than UXpin) to ensure proper functionality and accessibility.
