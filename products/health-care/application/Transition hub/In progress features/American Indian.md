## Feature background
The intent is to add the American Indian question as a required question to be placed after the existing race, ethnicity, origin question. It's currently in staging, but is on pause. Program team and ES (enrollment system) must finalize before publication.

- Program team previously requested an additional page for those who select "Yes" to American Indian will be asked to select their tribe. Because this list would include over 200 tribes, more information to the goal is needed in order to implement a good UX.
