## Feature background
Our analytics and [discovery research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/research/april-may-2021/end-user-discovery/10-10EZ%20Discovery%20Research%20readout.pdf) shows that the sections that cause the most confusion and result in the most drop-offs is the Military information and Household/financial information sections. Because these sections are not necessary for Veterans that are in Priority group 1, we will remove any questions that aren't necessary for their application.

User story: As a Veteran applying for health care, I would like to expedite the application so I can complete it faster, remove blockers, and have less confusion.

**Note:** This effort is different than "prefill fields" - sometimes the program team confuses these two efforts
 
**Implementation plan:**
- Phase 1: Short form for applicants with a service-connected disability of 50% or higher. 
- Phase 2: Short form for applicants with combat status.
