# VSA 10-10EZ Transition Hub

**Note:** These Transition Docs are "point in time" documents, and may not reflect current progress, deployments or upcoming efforts.

<br>

>**Team transition document | March 2022**
>
> The purpose of this transition document is to outline the current state of 1010-EZ product development. It serves as a "front door" to documentation and resources collected during the course of product design and development. Included are links to more specific transition hubs where you can find direct links to resources and references used during design and development.
> 
> **Note:** The 10-10EZ management was under the purview of the VSA-Caregivers team, thus you will notice that some links lead to va.gov-team/products/caregivers/10-10EZ/. Moving forward 10-10EZ documentation should live in va.gov-team/products/health-care/application/va-application/ If you're looking for information about the 10-10CG (Caregiver application) visit [10-10CG Transition Hub (March 2022)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/Transition%20hub/Transition%20Hub%20(March%202022).md).

## Product context 
The 10-10EZ: Application for VA health care was one of the first applications to be adapted to online on va.gov. Currently we are working to improve the UX and functionality. 

- Used by Veterans to apply for health care
- Approx. 8,000 submissions per month
- Login is available, but not required
     - Some fields are prefilled for authenticated users
     - Authenticated users can "save in progress" and return to complete their application
