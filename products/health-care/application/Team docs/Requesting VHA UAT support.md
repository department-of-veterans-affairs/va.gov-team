## Steps to request UAT support from VHA UAT team

- For support in future testing:
-   Send a message to the following group, VHA MS BSO Functional Testing Unit <VHAMSBSOFunctionalTestingUnit@va.gov> requesting the support.
-   Be sure to include the following information:
     - Systems being tested
     - Does the system being tested have a pre-production account or are you needing testing done in production.
     - Requirements, that were developed and what specifically is being tested.
     - Testing Data, if needed
     - UAT Dates
- This information then is reviewed and leadership determines if we are able to support.
