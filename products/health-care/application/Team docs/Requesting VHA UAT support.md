## Steps to request UAT support from VHA UAT team

- For support in future testing:
     -   Send a message to the following group, VHA MS BSO Functional Testing Unit <VHAMSBSOFunctionalTestingUnit@va.gov> requesting the support.
     -   Be sure to include the following information:
          - Systems being tested
          - Does the system being tested have a pre-production account or are you needing testing done in production.
          - Requirements, that were developed and what specifically is being tested.
          - Testing Data, if needed
          - UAT Dates
     - This information then is reviewed and leadership determines if we are able to support.
