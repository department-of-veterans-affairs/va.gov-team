# 2025 Sprint Planning for 10-10EZ, 10-10CG and 10-10EZR
- Current Sprint first

---
## ðŸ“† Sprint 27 (Aug 13 - Aug 26)

### Team initiative (not form-specific)
#### Obj: Knowledge sharing
- Over the next several sprints, the team will need to share knowledge between our 10-10 forms, and then with the IVC team on their forms.
     - Some of our teammates have started to do this, and we will continue throughout the contract to ensure a fairly even level of knowledge and comfort across all forms.
