# Platform Security request for information
- The team met with the Platform Security team on 7/28/2025.  They are looking for specific information, which we have outlined here.

- Reach out to #platform-security channel for questions
     - POC: Kenneth Mayo
  
**DO NOT INCLUDE PII HERE** - AWS Instances, CI/CD, etc cannot be linked here - must be shared on VA Network


### Products
- What is the name of your product(s)/system(s)?

          - 10-10EZ - Veteran health care application

- Describe its purpose in a few sentences.
     - 10-10EZ
          - This is an online form for Veterans to fill out and submit with the intention of enrolling in VA health care
     - 10-10EZR
          - This is an online form for Veterans, who are enrolled in VA health care, to provide updates to their personal information on their health record, such as income and deductibles, marital status/spouse information, dependents, next of kin, emergency contact, private health insurance.
     - 10-10CG
          - This is an online form for Veterans and their caregivers to fill out and submit with the intention of enrolling in the PCAFC program (For the VA to support caregivers while they provide care for Veterans)

- If you represent multiple products, please describe the relationship between them, if there is any.
     - There is no direct relationship between the products themselves. They are not reliant on each other.
     - The 10-10EZ and 10-10EZR both do connect through vets-api to VES (Veteran Enrollment System) and the forms themselves are very similar in structure, for the sake of consistency.
          - However, this connection is not dependent between the forms.

- Do you have a POC? Please list
- Describe the encryption used for the connection in transit (e.g., Not Encrypted, TLS 1.2, TLS 1.3, mTLS). Specify the certificate source if applicable (e.g., AWS ACM, Let's Encrypt, self-signed)
     - Veteran Enrollment System uses mTLS for the SOAP api. Platform has more info on where certs are stored. I know va.gov uses TLS 1.2 for most connections so most other calls to REST apis use that. Okta is used to get a bearer token for OAuth 2.0 authentication with MuleSoft. Mapbox, Google Analytics, and some Datadog requests are made from vets-wbsite from a web client and not vets-api like most other services. 
- List the types of PII shared (in each direction) with this connection
