# Tree test of the health apartment IA
## November 2021

*This is a content-focused analysis of the tasks with less than 50% success (plus one task with high success).* 

**Task 1: You need to see a podiatrist, but live 110 miles away from the closest VA podiatrist. You want to find out whether you’re eligible to see a non-VA podiatrist.**<br>
12% success, 55% directness

Besides answers we defined as success:
* Most chose Appointments > View, schedule, and manage appts. A few chose “Check in for an appt.” 
* Next up was Help and resources >  Help pages, FAQs, and user guides > Help pages on many topics OR User guides (about the big 4). Some also chose How to use MHV OR Contact us. 
* A few chose answers in Pharmacy and Copays and travel pay. 

Insights: 
* It seems that a good number of users don’t associate the term “Community Care” with seeing a non-VA provider. 
* Users expected to find eligibility info when scheduling an appt. 
* Some users would have sent a secure message to their provider to ask about their eligibility. 
* Did users who chose Pharmacy and Copays and travel pay do so b/c they saw Community Care providers in the past and thought they might find eligibility info there?

Thoughts on recommendations: 
* Cross-reference making an appointment with eligibility for seeing non-VA providers.
* Label “Community Care” in the navigation as “Seeing non-VA providers” (or something else that’s plain language).
* Use calls to action on the homepage to communicate what Community Care (CC) is. “Mission Act” is a term associated with CC b/c that’s the law behind CC.

**Task 2: You want to make an appointment with this podiatrist.**<br> 
88% success, 88% directness

Insights: 
* Some users use secure messaging to make appts.
* The users who knew what Community Care was thought they could make an appointment there. 

Thoughts on recommendations: 
* Tie Community Care section of the site with “Make an appointment.”
* Tie secure messaging to “Make an appointment.”


**Task 3: You have a 30% disability rating. You want to learn what health benefits your disability rating qualifies you for.**<br>
39% success, 73% directness

Besides answers we defined as success:
* Some who went to Health care looked under Eligibility. Others looked under My VA health care > VA health care coverage OR Disability rating. A few went to About VA health benefits and backed out.
* Next up was Help and resources >  Help pages, FAQs, and user guides > Help pages on many topics OR User guides (on the big 4). Some also chose About use MHV > MHV’s move to VA.gov OR Contact us. 
* Next up was Records > VA health summary, though some backed out of this.
* A few went to Appts, then turned back. 

Insights: 
* Users associated eligibility and coverage with learning what benefits your disability rating qualifies you for. 
* Users relied on Help and resources and Contact us.
* Some users thought their VA health summary would be helpful. 

Thoughts on recommendations: 
* Tie health care eligibility and coverage to disability rating.

**Task 8: You need to go to the dentist. How would you find out what coverage you qualify for?**<br>
24% success, 73% directness

Besides answers we defined as success:
* Most users went to Health care > Eligibility. `<< This is actually a correct answer.` Others who went to Health care then went to VA health care coverage. 
* Next up was Help and resources > Help pages, FAQs, and user guides > Help pages on many topics.
* A few went to Records or Copays and travel pay and turned back. Same with Appts and Track and research health, though some chose HealtheLiving Assessment under Track and research health.

Insights:

45% success, 73% directness

Besides answers we defined as success:
* Most users went to Help and resources >  Help pages, FAQs, and user guides > Help pages on many topics. Others who went to Help and resources chose the landing page or user guides on the big 4. A few went to MHV news and community and searched all articles. (MHV has published articles on PTSD.)
* Next up was Health care, which showed 4 paths. At least 1 person chose Community Care chosen as the answer. 
* A few went to Messages (chose Inbox, the default messaging page, which has a “compose” button), and a few went to Records (chose VA health summary).
* A few went to Track and research health > Track health > Health tracking devices and apps (which includes PTSD apps). `(This also would have been a correct answer in the tree test.)`

Insights: 
* Users think of PTSD as a health topic.
* Some users would have sent a secure message to their provider to ask for PTSD resources. 
* Some users know that VA has mobile apps to help with PTSD. `(This also would have been a correct answer in the tree test.)`
* Veterans might have chosen VA health summary under Records b/c they want to see PTSD resources that were included in info on their past appts. (Not sure if VA does this, but Veterans might think VA does.)

Thoughts on recommendations: 
* Leverage Help and resources for important topics like PTSD.
* Use the word “topics” somewhere in the navigation.
* Tie MHV articles about health topics to those topics.  
* Cross-link between VA mobile apps and health topics. 

**Task 10: Your doctor told you that you have high blood pressure and asked you to enter those numbers online between visits.**<br>
48% success, 76% directness

Besides answers we defined as success:
* The most users went to Records. They went to Labs and tests, Electronic sharing options, VA health summary, and Blue Button. More than half turned around; however, some chose every item but Blue Button as the answer. 
* A few users went on the correct path (Track and research health > Track health) and then chose Health tracking devices and apps. `This is also a correct answer since we did not tell users to enter their info on the website.` 
* The next-largest group of users went to Messages and looked in either their Inbox or Sent folder. Some chose the Sent folder.
* The next-largest group went to Health care and chose Update health care info. 
* A few went to Pharmacy and Appointments and turned around.

Insights: 
* Users might send a secure message to their provider to either ask how to enter blood pressure numbers — or to report numbers to providers. 
* The highest number of users associated entering blood pressure numbers with Records. 

Thoughts on recommendations: 
* Cross-reference Records with entering your health data.
* Cross-reference Update health care info with self-entering health stats like blood pressure. 
* Make sending a message easy, no matter the task.

**Task 13: You got married and you want to add your spouse as a dependent.**<br>
15% success, 36% directness

Besides answers we defined as success:
* The largest numbers of users went to Records and Help and resources. (A roughly equal number went to Health care.)
* Those who went to Records looked in VA Blue Button Report. VA health summary, Labs and tests, and Electronic record sharing options. Except for Labs and tests, all of those were chosen as the answer.
* A few users went to all of the following places and turned back: Pharmacy, Appointments, Messages, Copays and travel pay, Health supplies, and Track and research health. 
* In Health care, users explored the entire section (except for Community Care). Most turned around, but the largest number chose Family and caregiver benefits. 
* Users who went to Help and resources explored Help pages, FAQs, and user guides; How to use MHV (all turned back); About MHV (all turned back); and Contact us. Users who did not turn back chose Help and resources landing page, Help pages on many topics, and Contact form. 

Insights: 
* Users were unsure where to do this task, so they explored the tree widely. 
* Users might have thought Records was where official things were, like adding someone to your health coverage. 
* A significant number of users associated Family and caregiver benefits with adding a dependent. 
* Users relied on Help and resources, especially Contact form.
* No one chose Messages as an answer.  

Thoughts on recommendations: 
* As this is an important task, make it prominent on the homepage and Health care page. The context is managing your health care. Consider the flip side of this task: Removing a dependent from your VA health care. This is also important, as you may owe VA money if your dependent is no longer eligible and stays on your plan.
* Cross-reference Records and add a dependent.  
* Cross-reference Family and caregiver benefits with adding a dependent.
* Include how to add dependent in Help topics. 

**Task 14: Where would you expect to find information about COVID-19 vaccines?**<br>
27% success, 48% directness

Besides answers we defined as success:
* Overall, the largest group of users went to Health care. They chose various options here, turning back from About VA health benefits, Eligibility, and update health care info. Here they chose VA health care coverage, Eligibility for other things, and Community Care.
* The next-largest group went to Help and resources. Users chose 6 different answers here, including Help pages on many topics, MHV news and community (newsletter), and Contact form.
* The next-largest trafficked area was Pharmacy, and everyone turned back. 
* Fewer users went to these areas, and they turned back: Messages, Records, Copays and travel pay, and Health supplies. 

Insights: 
* Users were unsure where to do this task, so they explored the tree widely. 
* The largest number of users associated COVID vaccines with health care. 
* A significant number of users expected to see vaccine info in Pharmacy. 
* Users who successfully went to Appointments likely knew (or suspected) they could schedule a vaccine appointment. 
* Did users go to Records because they had a COVID vaccine and thought there would be info on it in their health record? 
* Users probably went to MHV newsletter because they saw articles on COVID-19 vaccines in the newsletter, which has published articles on COVID (making this a correct answer).   
* Hypothesis: By later in the tree test, users knew there were topic pages in Help and resources, so they went there.

Thoughts on recommendations: 
* Cross-reference Health care and Pharmacy with COVID vaccine info.
* During the pandemic, highlight COVID-19 info on the homepage and in related areas such as Health care and Pharmacy. 
* Consider whether Research health should be combined with topics in Help and resources. 
* Figure out whether there is a connection between COVID vaccine info and a user’s health record.
* Explore whether users want to look up vaccine info after they’ve been vaccinated.
