# Formal user reseach on homepage concept

## Goals
The VA Health Apartment team is conducting user testing of its homepage and high-level sitemap concept to understand: 
* How a variety of Veterans currently use MyHealtheVet,
* How our concept solves pain points, and 
* How to prioritize health information

The feedback from this research will inform future iterations of both the homepage and sitemap, as well as the overall design of the health apartment concept.

### Background 
The Health Apartment Team is designing a proof of concept for the health "apartment." This concept consolidates and streamlines the health experience by moving My HealtheVet and other VA health content into VA.gov. This project maintains the vision of the Digital Modernization Strategy set in 2017: to provide a single, high-quality digital version of every health product or tool, plus the ability for a Veteran to see all of their VA benefits - health, disabililty, education, and other - in one place, on VA.gov.

### Research questions
This study focuses on 3 main areas:
* **Critical tasks:** What are the critical actions a Veteran wants to see right away on the homepage?
* **Vital information:** What information do veterans need to see on the homepage prior to signing in (unauthenticated homepage)? After signing in (authenticated homepage)?
* **Content balance:** What's the right balance of content/information on the homepage, such that it doesn't overwhelm the user? How would they like that content and information presented? 
* **Orgnanization of content:** Is the content organized intuitively? Do Veterans understand the wording?

## Method
We'll use semi-structured interviews and observations for this study. This allows us to ask prepared questions to the user and document their behavior as they explore the homepage design, while also giving us the flexibility to pivot and ask follow-up questions should an interesting thread reveal itself. The in-depth qualitative information we'll glean as a result of the study will give us actionable insights as we iterate on our design concept.

## Recruitment criteria

Determine how many participants...

### Primary recruitment criteria: 

**Familiarity with My HealtheVet** <br>
Ideally get at least 2 participants from each: 
* Signed in to MHV in the past 6 months
* Signed in to VA.gov in the past 6 months
* Never signed in to MHV or VA.gov

Note:
* Some Veterans don’t differentiate between MHV and VA.gov. Some call MHV “the VA’s website” and don’t know about VA.gov.
* Veterans with VA health care typically go straight to MHV; however, they don’t always realize they are on VA.gov after following a link for something like “schedule an appointment.” 

**Age/era of service** <br>
Ideally get at least 1 participant from each: 
* Left the military within the last 3 years
* Served in Operation Enduring Freedom or the Iraq War
* Served in the Gulf War
* Served in the Vietnam War

**Use of VA benefits** <br>
Ideally get at least 1 participant from each: 
* Uses VA health care only, or health care + disability compensation — but no other benefit types (e.g., housing, education)
* Uses health care + other VA benefit type(s)

### Secondary recruitment criteria we will strive to meet:
* Gender: At least 1/4 women
