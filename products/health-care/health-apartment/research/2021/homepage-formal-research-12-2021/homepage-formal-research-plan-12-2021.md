# Formal user reseach on homepage concept

## Goals
The VA Health Apartment team is conducting user testing of its authenticated homepage concept to understand: 
* If action links on the homepage are easily discovered and executed by Veterans
* How we might improve content and user flows to make it easier for Veterans to manage their health care

The feedback from this research will inform future iterations of both the homepage and sitemap, as well as the overall design of the health apartment concept.

### Background
This project maintains the vision of the Digital Modernization Strategy set in 2017: to provide a single, high-quality digital version of every health product or tool, plus the ability for a Veteran to see all of their health-related VA benefits in one place on VA.gov.

This study will build off of the results of our [informal user testing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/health-apartment/research/2021/homepage-guerilla-test-12-2021/2021-12-guerilla-research-report.pdf), conducted in December 2021. 

### Research questions
This study focuses on 2 main areas:
* **Critical tasks:** Are the tasks on the homepage easy for a Veteran to action?
* **Content balance:** Do Veterans understand the difference between informational and actionable links?

### Hypotheses
For each question above, respectively, we believe the following:
* When given a task, Veterans will be able to find and complete the tasks given to them with little confusion.
* Veterans will know the difference between a link that takes them to an action and one that takes them to a resource or content page. 

## Method
We'll use a mix of open-ended and task-specific questions for this research. The open-ended questions will primarily gauge how the Veteran currently uses MyHealtheVet (and serve as a warm-up), while the task-specific questions will give us insight as to whether our layout and content makes tasks discoverable and easily actioned. 

For testing the mobile concept, we'll use Zoom and staging on VA.gov

Here is the [conversation guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/health-apartment/research/2021/homepage-formal-research-12-2021/Conversation-guide.md).

## Location
We'll conduct user research remotely online using MO Studio's Zoom account.

## Recruitment approach
Our intended audience for this research is Veterans. We are planning to recruit through Perigean. 

## Recruitment criteria

### Familiarity with My HealtheVet 
Ideally get at least 2 participants from each:

* Signed in to MHV in the past 6 months
* Signed in to VA.gov in the past 6 months
* Never signed in to MHV or VA.gov

### Note:

* Some Veterans don’t differentiate between MHV and VA.gov. Some call MHV “the VA’s website” and don’t know about VA.gov.
* Veterans with VA health care typically go straight to MHV; however, they don’t always realize they are on VA.gov after following a link for something like “schedule an appointment.”

### Number of years with the VA/eras of service
Ideally get at least 1 participant from each:

* Left the military within the last 3 years
* Served in Operation Enduring Freedom or the Iraq War
* Served in the Gulf War
* Served in the Vietnam War

### Use of VA benefit 
Ideally get at least 1 participant from each:

* Uses VA health care only, or health care + disability compensation — but no other benefit types (e.g., housing, education)
* Uses health care + other VA benefit type(s)

### Secondary recruitment criteria we will strive to meet:

* Gender: At least 1/4 women
* Inclusion: At least 1/4 people of color
* Geography: Participants from East Coast, West Coast, and the Midwest
* Disability: At least three participants who use DAT

**What we expect to learn:**
* Veterans who use My HealtheVet will help us understand if the new layout of the tasks they're accustomed to doing in MHV are as easy as they're used to, if not easier.
* Veterans who do not use the My HealtheVet website will help us understand if the health apartment homepage is easy to use for people who do not use My HealtheVet.
