## Session setup
For this session, the moderator will share their screen, so the participant can view the redesigned homepage without having to click a link or open a file. 

### Introduction (2 minutes)
Thanks for joining us today! My name is XXX and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about your experience accessing VA healthcare online and show you a concept for a redesigned health care page.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

* This entire session should take about 30 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

* We want hear your honest opinions. We're technologists focusing on making your experience the best it can be. Understanding your thoughts will help us create better digital products for Veterans like you, and we will not be offended by any opinions you express.


* If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. This is a voluntary session, and you will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.

* Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? Just so you know, these recordings are not shared outside of the people on this call. We use them only to confirm that we have captured what you have said accurately, and then we delete them 2 weeks after the session. Do you have any questions about this? Are you ok if we record today?

    * If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

Start recording.

* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Prior to showing concept (5-7 minutes)
* Please use these questions as a guide, not necessarily a script. The goal is to find out what's important to the user and if it's reflected in the design. If you see an opportunity for an important follow up question, take it. 

### Understand what they use 
* Tell me how you take care of your health care online
   * (listen for: their process to get to MHV or VA.gov, which site they use, what they do on the site, what "health care" means to them)
* Do you cancel or adjust your appointments online?
* How do you refill your prescriptions?
* How do you communicate with your providers/doctors?
* Are there other patient portals/online systems you use to manage your health care? 
   * (if yes): What do you like about them?

### Understand what's important
* What do you mainly use My HealtheVet for? 
* How often do you use it? 
* Is there anything you would like to do on My HealtheVet but currently cannot? 
(Make sure to probe and ask follow-up questions).

### First Impression
Now I'm going to show you a new concept for the My HealtheVet homepage, and when I do, I'd like you to give me your first impression. 
(Things to watch and listen for: Where they point their mouse to first, what they want to click on, if they remark on something missing).
* Tell me about your first impressions. 
* Where is your attention drawn?
* What other observations do you have about this page?  
 

### Digging Deeper 

* Is there anything missing on the page that you would expect to be there, that would help you manage your health care online? (Potential follow ups: How would you use the missing element? Where would you like to see it placed on the page?)
* Let's look at appointments, what would you expect to see here? 
   * What information or actions do you care about most?
   * If you wanted to see all of your appointments, what would you do?

* What information or actions would you like to see in "Health Care"?
   * If you wanted to see more details than shown here about your Health Care, what would you do?
* What information or actions would you like to see in "Disability"?
* If you had trouble with something you're trying to do through this website, what would you do?  Listen to answer and then point to "Help and Resources" if this is not one of their answers
   * What information or actions would you like to see in "Help and Resources"?

* If time allows: What does the term "Health Supplies" mean to you? After participant answers, tell them what it is, then ask if there is a better name for "health supplies."

## End questions

* Do you have any questions for us? 

## Thank you and closing (2 minutes)
We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
