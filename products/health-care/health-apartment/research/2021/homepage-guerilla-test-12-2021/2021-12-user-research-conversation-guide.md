# Conversation guide for guerrilla user research on health apartment homepage concept
Conducted mid December 2021.

## Session setup
For this session, the moderator will share their screen so the participant can view the health homepage without having to click a link or open a file. 

### Introduction (2 minutes)
Thanks for joining us today! My name is *(insert name).* I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to show you a concept for putting all your health care needs online in one place. We'll show you the homepage.

Before we start, a few things:

* This session should take about 30 minutes. I don't want to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

* We want your honest opinions. We are focusing on making your experience the best it can be. Understanding your thoughts will help us create better digital products for Veterans like you, and we will not be offended by any opinions.

* If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.

* Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? 
    * Just so you know, these recordings are not shared outside of our team. We use them only to confirm that we've captured what you have said accurately, and then we delete them after 2 weeks. Do you have any questions about this? Are you ok if we record today?

    * If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are OK with me recording this session once more.

Start recording.

* I've started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Prior to showing concept (5-7 minutes)
* Please use these questions as a guide, not necessarily a script. The goal is to find out what's important to the user and if it's reflected in the design. If you see an opportunity for an important follow up question, take it. 

### Understand what they use 
* Do you use My HealtheVet?
* Do you use VA.gov for your health care?
> Listen for: 
> * which site they use
> * their process to get to My HealtheVet, VA.gov, or another website
> * what they do on the site
> * what "health care" means to them

* Do you cancel or adjust your appointments online?
* How do you communicate with your providers/doctors?

### Understand what's important to Veterans who use My HealtheVet or VA.gov
Do not ask these questions to Veterans who don't use My HealtheVet or VA.gov.

When necessary, ask follow-up questions to get a deeper understanding or to clarify what the Veteran is saying.

*If they use My HealtheVet:*
* What do you use My HealtheVet for? 
* How often do you use My HealtheVet? 
* Are there things you would like to do on My HealtheVet but currently cannot? 
   * *(If yes, ask this for each thing:)* Why would you like to do that? 

*If they use VA.gov:*
* What health care things do you use VA.gov for? 
* How often do you use VA.gov? 
* Are there things you would like to do on VA.gov but currently cannot? 
   * *(If yes, ask this for each thing:)* Why would you like to do that? 

## While showing concept (15 minutes)

Ask the participant:

### Digging Deeper

   * What messages would be sent to you?
   * Whom would you message?

   * What information or actions would you expect to see in "Help and Resources"?

* If time allows: What does the term "Health Supplies" mean to you? 
   * *(After participant answers, tell them you can order hearing aid and prosthetic socks here.)*
   * Is there a better name for "health supplies"?

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful as we continue to work on the VA website and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 

Great, thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
