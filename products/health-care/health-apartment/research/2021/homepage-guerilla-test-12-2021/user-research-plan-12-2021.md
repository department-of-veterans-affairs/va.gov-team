# Informal user research on health home page concepts

## Goals
The VA Health Apartment team is conducting user testing of its authenticated homepage and high-level sitemap concept to understand: 
* How a variety of Veterans currently use MyHealtheVet,
* How our concept solves pain points, and 
* What information Veterans care about most. 

The feedback from this research will inform future iterations of both the homepage and sitemap, as well as the overall design of the health apartment concept.

### Background
This project maintains the vision of the Digital Modernization Strategy set in 2017: to provide a single, high-quality digital version of every health product or tool, plus the ability for a Veteran to see all of their health-related VA benefits in one place on VA.gov.

### Research questions
This study focuses on 3 main areas:
* **Critical tasks:** What are the critical actions a Veteran wants to see right away on the homepage?
* **Vital information:** What information do veterans need to see on the homepage after signing in (authenticated homepage)?
* **Content balance:** What's the right balance of content/information on the homepage, such that it doesn't overwhelm the user? How would they like that content and information presented?

### Hypotheses
For each question above, respectively, we believe the following:
* Veterans want to see specific tasks on the homepage. They want to see tasks and information relevant to them. This fits with a recurring theme in previous research, that Veterans are task-oriented.
* When Veterans sign in, they expect the website to show them: 1) current health information and tasks (exs: appointments, secure messages, and refills due), and 2) whether they must take action to move a process forward (ex: finish health care application).
* Veterans are overwhelmed by too much text. They want well-organized content that guides them to a task or resource quickly, simply, and clearly using plain language. 
* Veterans with health care want to see "about" information because either: 1) they need to understand general info on VA health care (i.e., what they get), or 2) they want to share "about" info with other Veterans. 

## Method
We'll use semi-structured interviews and observations for this study. This allows us to ask prepared questions and document Veterans' behavior as they explore the homepage design, also giving us the flexibility to pivot and ask follow-up questions should an interesting thread reveal itself. The in-depth qualitative information we'll glean from this study will help us iterate on our design concept. 

Here is the [conversation guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/health-apartment/research/2021/homepage-guerilla-test-12-2021/2021-12-user-research-conversation-guide.md).

## Location
We'll conduct user research remotely online using MO Studio's Zoom account.

## Recruitment approach
We are planning to conduct guerrilla research. We will identify Veterans in our social networks and coordinate with them to set up research sessions on Zoom. We will do this on a rolling basis, talking to at least 6 participants (3 on mobile, 3 on desktop) from December 10 to December 13. 

## Recruitment criteria

### Primary criteria
We will test the authenticated mobile and desktop homepage concepts with at least 6 Veterans who have VA health care.

### Secondary criteria
* At least 4 Veterans who use the My HealtheVet website to manage their VA health care, and
* At least 2 Veterans who do not use My HealtheVet to manage their VA health care.

**What we expect to learn:**
* Veterans who use the My HealtheVet website will help us understand if we're going in the right direction with the concept for the health apartment homepage, given their experience with using My HealtheVet. 
* Veterans who do not use the My HealtheVet website will help us understand if the health apartment homepage is easy to use for people who do not use My HealtheVet.
