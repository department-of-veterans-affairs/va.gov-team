## Items of note:
* Design consistency: Participant pointed out several times that the shift from the orientation of the Big Four to the orientation of the cards below was jarring. 

* Messages: The participant referred to secure messages prior to being shown the designs, but when he was specifically discussing the designs, he thought the messages that would be shown would concern lab tests and other subjects outside of secure messaging (which they would not). **>> VA could send messages about lab results. Messages could be about any interactions with providers.**

* Critical Information: For several items, including refills, messages and appointments, the participant said they would like to see necessary associated actions. 

Some examples:
“Similar to what I said about messages, I would think, having some sort of notification that you have new labs that are there for you to view when you login could be helpful.”

“if I sent a message, I’d expect to see if there was a response that the msg had been seen and responded too. If someone’s sending me one, I would expect that to be there as well.”

“If refills remaining was one, I’d expect to see a CTA to take quick action on that refill if I need more.”

* Telehealth: The participant specifically called out Telehealth appointments during the test, which has been an internal consideration with the team. 

* Mental health: This was also a specific call out, as the participant noted that there could be a separate section specifically for mental health.

## Questions about health care:

P I have health care through my job and if I need to file a claim I’ll usually go to their website and log in and add any relevant information for a claim to be processed. 

M What website is that

P I forgot the exact name, the blue cross blue shield - they have os many names for it .

M Do you have VA health care

P I am eligible and I have signed up, but I have never used it

M what does health care mean to you

P it’s a check up for myself or if I”m experiencing something out of the ordinary, something I’m not sure what it might be, then I’ll make an  appointment  for a doctor. For me health care is checking up on my general health unless I have an emergency or something pressing.

M cancel or adjust  appointment  online

P It depends on the doctor I’m working with. Sometimes they allow you to do it online, sometimes they’re a little more old school and they call a few days before the appointment and want you to confirm or adjust.

M Refill prescriptions

P for me personally I don’t have any prescribed right now, but if I do, it’s after an appointment with a doctor. Sometimes they might send the prescription to my preferred pharmacy or they’ll handwrite it and I have to  bring it to the pharmacy myself.

M Do you have a MyHealtheVet account?

P I have a va.gov act and MHV account. I tried to schedule an appointment last year when vaccines were first rolling out for covid and I wanted to see what it was like o schedule through VA and so I could get my shot. I did use the appointment scheduler to cancel that appointment online. 

M Have you logged in to MHV?
P I have yeah. I logged in not that long ago to send a secure message. I forgot what I was looking for. Either a phone number or something. I’ll have to see what the message was about. I figured what the hell, let me use this secure message to see if. I can get the information. I had my photo taken for a VA health care ID card. Months had gone by, didn’t receive it in the mail, so I was trying to find who to contact, why there was a delay, to see if I could get someone’s contact information. I did get a phone number, and I got connected to the person who processed my information, and they said it was something on their back end. A week later I got the card in the mail. 

M like about portals?
P It’s secure. You have to be authenticated. Assuming they use good encryption technology for those messages to be private. You don’t necessarily have to wait to make an appointment with your doctor to have a conversation about your health care. You can have a record or documentation of your care and view the results there. You can see your medical history because it’s easy to forget some of these things. It’s good to have the ability to review your past appointments



M You said messaging was the only thing you used MyHealtheVet for?
P I think years ago when I had to create an account I definitely signed in…I can’t remember what I was doing it for. Either it was to get a letter for something…I can’t recall at this time. I continued to have health insurance through whatever job I had after I got out of marine corps. It was never important for me to use those systems. I didn’t have chronic health systems. I may not be a the right test candidate .

M What are things you’d like to do on MHV but can’t?
P I like that you can send a secure message. Being able to refill prescriptions is good, scheduling and canceling apts. I can’t think of anything off the top of my head on top of any features I would want. I think you can view past medical test results … the only thing I can think of is if there’s a mental health…the ability to find doctors or therapists through the website who are in the VAs network. Telehealth, that you don’t have to be there in person, but schedule and have  appointment s over the internet. Whether it’s mental health or general doctor, that’s something that can be helpful. A lot of times there are other people and it’s difficult for them to go to physical appointments  all the time. 

## Showing concept

P I like the design consistency with VA.gov. You can see these sites are now aligning in how they’re using typography. It makes it feel like it’s more unified. If you click on my health, it ports you to MHV from VA.gov, and the ui is completely different. So this makes it feel like it’s a singular experience. All the things I would expect to see from the old ui are there up front. I think I saw secure messages there. 

M Where is your attention drawn initially? 

P My visual attention directed towards the name, but also because I’m biased, I was in the marine corps, so I recognize the logo, that’s where my eyes went. I noticed the alert about medical co pays, and then I noticed the four boxes. I think, as you’re scrolling down, it’s not clear to me why this is then broken up into this way, why the cards become smaller. It’s unclear what you’re trying to message to me as a user with this visual design change. Obviously the four cards up top take more, these are the things we think you’re here to do, but because of the way my eye goes, I’m scanning the four cards, then this is bifurcated, and I’m no longer reading it left to right, I’m reading it up and down. And then it goes to help and resources, and then I have to go back to reading left to right. I think it’s a little jarring, having to change how I’m reading the information. With these four cards, I’m either going left to right, so there’s a nice flow there. The headers are not in the cards (below), where they are for  appointment s and pharmacy. Now I’m having to read down and read down. 

M appointments  card
P I would expect, if I have an appointment to see that  appointment  there, I see the location, I can click view, which I’m assuming either takes me to another page or expands the view. If I have multiple appointments , I would expect to see another link that says view all appointments , or that card expands with multiple appointments  that I have that. 

I would see if I could click on the appointments  header to see if that takes me to an appointments  header. I think not everybody will think that the header is clickable so adding the language to see all  appointment s might be helpful if you’re only going to display one appt.

M what info do you care about most

P I think the ability to cancel or modify appointment from here might be helpful as well. If you’re putting this upfront and center, then maybe adding the ability to cancel or modify here, to save a step, might be helpful.

M RX what would you expect to see

P What prescriptions I have that are open, how many refills I have remaining. If refills remaining was one, I’d expect to see a CTA to take quick action on that refill if I need more. Your Doctor probably needs to approve that so that instigates some action between you and your doctor to get that prescription more refills added to it. 

M What do you care about the most
P I would care the most about knowing how many refills I have left for each prescription. I’m sure most people are keeping a running count in their head, so being able to come here and see that info clearly would be helpful. 

M Messages P if I sent a message, I’d expect to see if there was a response that the msg had been seen and responded too. If someone’s sending me one, I would expect that to be there as well. If there’s multiple messages…I don’t know, I think viewing this box more as a notification hub rather than put what kind of message is there, just letting someone know that there are messages waiting for them, then going to the page to see those messages, because this is a much smaller space. 

M what kinds of messages
P eIther about medical tests that you’ve done, have been completed, and there are results that the doctor wants to go over with you. It’s hard for me as an individual to think through that just because I am not that active with doctors. I don’t have several doctors that I’m in communication with for different things. I don’t know if I’m the best person to get understanding of that section.

M Medical records

P You’re saying lab tests and results and health records and its links. Similar to what I said about messages, I would think, having some sort of notification that you have new labs that are there for you to view when you login could be helpful. I don’t think displaying information for my health records is necessary. 

M Health care actions
P if I already have a MHV account, it doesn’t mean I’ve signed up for a healthcare act, I think some of the information might not be relevant to have here. Like “about. VA health care” I think if I’m someone who is an active user, I don’t think it’s necessary to have that information there. My VA health care plan, because I”m authenticated and signed in, that’s personalized info that I might want to see.

M see more info about your health care
P depending on what I”m looking for, I’d click on one of the links here. Finance to me is a little unclear, just because if I have a VA healthcare plan, I generally believe I”m not paying for that, so I don’t know what finance means int he sense of a va health care plan. 

M health care supplies
P I’m not sure.  Because, when I’m thinking of health, I’m thinking of general well being so…medical supplies might be more aligned with what you’re trying to describe there. Medical care supplies, instead of health care supplies, and that’s because I associate health with general well being, and medical with action that’s being taken. Whether that’s some sort of device, like socks or hearing aid, that’s am medical device, not health advice

M Disability
P How does disability relate to health care - I would put that front and center, because I think there’s a misconception for a lot of people, and then applying for claims and appeal. A lot of veterans, like myself before I got out, we had medical appointments  and documented any injury I had while I was serving, and that became our disability claim, but you can apply for further disabilities after you get out, and some may arise after you get out, so you need to apply later. I think explaining the difference between disability and health care would be good. 

M trouble doing something on the site
P I would spend time first looking through the navigation of the website to see if there’s something I’m looking for but can’t find. Might use drop down menu from the top. If it’s trying to find a specific phone number, I might use secure messaging. If there’s some information that I don’t understand, I would start with secure messaging, then I might reach out to a fellow veteran who I trust and would ask them if they have experience with what I’m trying to do. The last action would be to call the help desk. 

M Help and resources
P Contact my healthevet is a link, and I would expect some other information there, whether it’s an email address, or a physical address. I can’t think of anything else.

M Magic wand
P The visual design is something I would consider doing different when it comes to centering and separating of health care and disability. Kept four cards at the top, then put health care and disability as their own like help and resources that would be better. 

S does this mean mhv is no longer going to exist?
M That would be farther into the future. We are bringing everything in MHV into VA.gov and bringing the health things on VA.gov onto this concept. This is supposed to be the single health home.

S does that mean I have to create a whole new username and password?
P That should not influence that, however, any changes that are being made to account…that is a separate matter. Whatever account you have will work.
