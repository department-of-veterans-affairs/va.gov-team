## P5 - Desktop homepage concept

### Do you use My HealtheVet? 
* I have not used that link you sent me, so no.  
### Do you use VA.gov for your health care? 
* I don’t. I do have insurance through my employer. VA is primarily like emergency backup for me.

### While showing concept (15 minutes)

I'd like your first impression. Talk out loud. Say anything that comes to mind. And let me know when you would like me to scroll.
### Let's look at appointments: 
### What would you expect to see here? 
* Some sort of change function or confirm. Basically this is saying there is an appointment in the cue for December 10th at 8:15. Doesn't really tell you the practitioner’s name. Santa Ana VA clinic, I’ve never been to that clinic before. Maybe some directions as far as where it is or anything. If you need to change, here’s the contact info. 
### What information or actions do you care about most? 
* Time. Date. Practitioner’s name. If you look at the right under messages, you can see there’s something from the doctor. If you can show it there, why not show it where it matters?  
### If you wanted to see all of your appointments, what would you do?
* I imagine you probably select appointments hyperlink to access them. If you could see them all here, it would be a cleaner view. Instead of having in box configuration just lay it out. Appointments would be 1 horizontal area. 
### Now let's look at pharmacy:
### What would you expect to see here? 
* Prescriptions makes sense. Refills remaining… If someone is using this portal they may or may not have private health insurance. Maybe they’re on Tricare, I don’t know. Something on co-pay related to whatever insurance they have, I would look for. Any action required before you pick it up. Example, your albuterol prescription will be available at this day and time. 
### If you wanted to see all of your prescriptions, what would you do? 
* I would immediately select the pharmacy hyperlink to see if anything is there. I’m not sure if other prescriptions would populate as the albuterol has, but if I clicked on prescriptions, it should sort of be illustrated here.

### Now let's look at messaging:
### What kinds of messages would you expect to see here? (e.g., "What would the messages be about?" 
* Things that are kinda important. I don’t think that this is… I think it’d be more meaningful for it to be relevant for this individual. Action that he or she needs to take related to next appointment. Not necessarily here’s your account summary or administrative type messages that are less important.
### Would you expect to send and receive messages? 
* No. That’s why I think it’s important if something requires action you really flag it and make it dummy proof so that this person knows that something is important.

### For Medical Records:
### What would you expect to see here? 
* I don’t remember if medical records are uploaded to this. When I was in the service you just had a paper medical record. That’s what I was used to. But we’re living in the 21st century. I’m assuming this is your primary care provider, something related to your lab work or when things are due, maybe you have a shot coming up, whatever. If it’s related to you and the documentation you need, that’s what I would be looking for here. 
### What information or actions do you care about most? 
* I’m not sick and I don’t have any pre-existing conditions.  What I would look for would be different than other people. I’d look for vaccinations/immunizations… somewhere where I can provide proof that I got this immunization or whatever… things that I may need to provide as part of my, if I like needed to go travel required shots.

### What information or actions would you like to see in "Health Care"? 
* I don’t really understand the difference between the my VA healthcare plan and just about VA healthcare. Seems like it’s the same thing. As far as Non-VA providers, I think that is for if for whatever reason someon wanted to access a provider outside the network… lik the Dummy proof stuff, what you need to do to get this thing paid for would be the type of things you’d want to make clear. Specifically how much it’s going to cost you and any out of pocket expenses you may occur and how to avoid being stuck with this monstrous bill. 
### If you wanted to see more information than shown here about your health care, what would you do? 
* Maybe I’d select cost billing to investigagte what it would cost to see someone outside the network. Access health and resources at the bottom just to see what other information like FAQs was available. But I think when it comes to the plan itself, I’m just looking for FAQs and if I can’t find the answer either an email address or phone number to find out. 

### What information or actions would you like to see in "Disability"? 
* Applying is there. I feel like a lot of veterans probably already applied and have an existing disability. Area more applicable would be claims. I didn’t walk away from service with major disabilities.
### If you had trouble with something you're trying to do through this website, what would you do? 
* I’d google to find what it is you’re looking for and the most expeditious way possible. On these government websites, things can be a bit difficult to navigate so it can be a challenge to find what your looking for.
### What information or actions would you expect to see in "Help and Resources"? 
* You’ve got the help desk but I’m not sure if that’s customer service or someone having a problem logging on. I’m guessing the second category. But, what happens if you have a problem that needs escalating. You’re probably just stuck. I think it would make sense to have some sort of email address or phone number for customer support, because I know it happens… You’re basically stuck you can’t move past this one area, sometimes the service member can’t resolve it. How is that person going to finish it up? The whole wearable device thing, I wouldn’t use it. Maybe the VA mobile app if it offers some distinct functionality or made life easier, then I would download it. In my experience they haven’t really been that great, so I’m leery about downloading anything like that. 

### What does the term "Health Supplies" mean to you? 
* I guess it could be.. .I’m not really sure the context. Things you could use to be more proactive about your health? Or maybe it’s things like Smoking cessation? I think it’s a vague term.
* (After participant answers, tell them you can order hearing aid and prosthetic socks here.) I think so. Why don’t you put I need to order hearing aids or whatever. I think that if someone doesn’t know what it is, they’re not gonna click on it. Having a specific page related to those things so that people know that they are covered is important for the discoverability of something like that.

### End questions
### If you had a magic wand, what would you add to this page or change about it? 
* I don’t know add. Change, a much cleaner, simpler layout. Prioritize what are most highly trafficked areas of this page. Applying for disability is that someone… it’s taking up all of this realestate. my healthcare plan, if those things not important just remove it or put it at the bottom. Otherwise makes for a cluttered view in my opinion
