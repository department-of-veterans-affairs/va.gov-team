12.14.21 VA Apt Homepage Concept Guerilla Testing Notes - Participant 6 (Mobile)
Start Time: 8:00 AM EST

### Items of Note:
**Design** - Commented on user friendliness and appointments being right up top.
**Messages** - Pointed out need for differentiation between message types; lab results, physician notes, tele-health visits.
**Healthcare** - Was confusing. Not sure if it’s just personal demographics or is it generic? What does finance mean? Better name for Health Supplies, Medical/Health Supplies. The word “health” seems to throw off.

Thanks for joining us today! My name is (insert name). I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to show you a concept for putting all your health care needs online in one place. We'll show you the homepage.

Before we start, a few things:
* This session should take about 30 minutes. I don't want to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
* We want your honest opinions. We are focusing on making your experience the best it can be. Understanding your thoughts will help us create better digital products for Veterans like you, and we will not be offended by any opinions.
* If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
* Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? Sure, no worries.
* Just so you know, these recordings are not shared outside of our team. We use them only to confirm that we've captured what you have said accurately, and then we delete them after 2 weeks. Do you have any questions about this? Are you ok if we record today?
* If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are OK with me recording this session once more.
* Start recording.I've started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? Yes


Do you use My HealtheVet or VA.gov for your healthcare? 
* So I’ve been on both sites and I don’t necessarily use either one.
In the past what do you use them for: 
* Normally just searching to see what’s on the site. Checking for benefits. Anything that’s sent out I kinda peruse.
Do you cancel or adjust your appointments online?: 
* Actually, I use Tricare Prime

Communicate with doctors: 
* Variety of ways since the tricare online site pretty much sucks. Luckily I haven’t had to seek healthcare, but I have had a referral out that has been impossible to get improved. 
## While showing concept (15 minutes)
### I’d like your first impression. Talk out loud. Say anything that comes to mind. And let me know when you would like me to scroll. 
* So, first impressions ….it took me right to appointments. Seems user friendly. I’d like to know how I get there because the top header is small. The medications I am currently on would be showing under pharmacy and would expand?
### Let’s look at appointments:
### What would you expect to see here? 
* I guess it depends how many appointments I have. I guess next appointment would be appropriate, date, time, noticing that it would be on the phone. Font size would probably be appropriate. The clinic just says Santa Ana VA clinic. It doesn’t say what clinic. I assume when you open it up will provide more details.
### What information or actions do you care about most? 
* Initially I’d like to see what clinic it is. I could have multiple appointments at multiple clinics. 
### If you wanted to see all of your appointments, what would you do? 
* I’d click appointments.

### Now let's look at pharmacy:
### What would you expect to see here? 
I would say that’s appropriate. I know some people are on multiple meds, so it’d be difficult to put all of them on this initial site. How would you choose what’s shown? It would be alphabetical I’m assuming. You’d click on view more to expand it. HOW WOULD YOU WANT CATEGORIZED OR PRIORITIZED? I’m not sure. I’m a nurse so trying to think what the best view would be. When you click pharmacy probably active meds.
### What information or actions do you care about most? 
* If you show refills remaining, I’d like to click on that med and refill here. I guess this would be asking for a lot, but if you click on that med and there are no refills left, a way to contact your provider. 

### Now let's look at messaging:
### What kinds of messages would you expect to see here? (e.g., "What would the messages be about?" 
* Differentiate between messages you send to your provider or messages that you get. If I’m sending a message, some indication that the message has been received. If I’m getting a message, what the message pertains to. Lab results, tests, etc
### Would you expect to send and receive messages? 
* I think that’s kinda the intent of messages. It’s a back and forth. It’d be hard to message and not get any response back, unless its
### What messages would be sent to you? 
* If I’m sending a refill request or if I’ve had an appointment and awaiting test results or lab results. A difference in messages going back and forth between a provider vs a virtual visit. Where would that go? 

### For Medical Records:
### What would you expect to see here? 
* I’m not sure. Is the intent to have your whole medical record on there and available?
### What information or actions do you care about most? 
* It says labs and tests and so the ability to go back in… again I’m a healthcare provider, so I’m using it for comparison or whatever. Health records themselves should have everything documented, am I gonna see my last visit and what was written? That’s never been an option in the past as much as it is now with electronic health records. I’m not sure what I’d use it for other than confirming what information was documented from my visits.

### What information or actions would you like to see in "Health Care"? 
* What would healthcare be referring to? …looks like it’s just MY information. Like this would be like my settings. Whatever pertains to me regarding my healthcare. Patient demographics. Health supplies not clear. Finance what’s that? Money I owe, money I have to pay? 
### If you wanted to see more information than shown here about your health care, what would you do? 
* In terms of anything with my healthcare? I’m trying to think of an example of what else I’d want. It seems like it’s pretty…About VA healthcare seems generic and not related to me, so it feels out of place since it’s just general information. I guess it may be appropriate there if you’re delving more into something you’ll need. Seems like patient information would be further at the top. Available benefits seems generic. If I wanted to know more about what I have, I’d click that.

### What information or actions would you like to see in "Disability"? 
* It’s pretty self explanatory if I’m applying. Claims and appeals, if I needed to do that seems like the place I’d go to do that. How does disability relate to healthcare? That question is a little bit… what does that mean? With my disability, how that relates to my healthcare or what’s covered? That’s a little, not very intuitive of what that means.
### If you had trouble with something you're trying to do through this website, what would you do? 
So, if I needed something… like I needed more information or what I want is not here? I see Help and Resources down at the bottom.
### What information or actions would you expect to see in "Help and Resources"? 

* You’re on this site, so I’m assuming you’re on the app. Is this the app. There’s an app. That’s self explanatory. Updates pretty self explanatory. I get the newsletter by email so that’s understandable. Connect my wearable device. I just got my fitbit and the VA connected, that’s awesome! There’s a phone number. Contact, I’m not sure… is there anymore after that? I’d  probably click on that to see what that means. And what would the help desk? Is that a help desk for the app? For the site and problems with the site or is it your healthcare to ask questions? Is that the number you call for the appointment? Is that the number  you call to get your ID help. Says resources, so I’d assume help with any of those things listed in that section.

### What does the term "Health Supplies" mean to you? 
* Again being a provider, I know that there are some patients who need wound care supplies or insulin supplies… umm anything related to their healthcare that is not a med I guess.
### (After participant answers, tell them you can order hearing aid and prosthetic socks here.) 
* Probably, but I’m trying to think what it would be. Maybe Health/Medical Supplies maybe. Medical for me would be more of the syringes, alcohol pads etc. Health would be… I don’t know what health would be.
## End questions
### If you had a magic wand, what would you add to this page or change about it? 
* I feel like pretty much everything at the top is probably good. When it gets down to healthcare and disability, there’s a little bit of ambiguity without clicking on the information. Clarity of what is there. I’m just saying that because if I went to this site, I’d be clicking on every single thing… what’s here and what’s there. 
## Thank you and closing (2 minutes)
We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful as we continue to work on the VA website and make sure it really works for Veterans.
Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session?
Great, thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
