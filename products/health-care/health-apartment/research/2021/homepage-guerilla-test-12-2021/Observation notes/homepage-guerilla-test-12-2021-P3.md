## P3 - Homepage desktop concept
### Key observations: 
**Content strategy**: What is Finance?  Why use how to apply for benefits when you already have them… something more relevant?
**Design**: add PCM section… Physician name, clinic contact, clinic location.  Expect greater detail in appointments (doctor name and specialty)
**Critical information**: notifications for things like refills due, refill expiring, new info added to health record (labs, charting), status on disability claims

### Observations:   
* Signs in using the web version of MHV in the authenticated experience/  
* Uses MHV primarily for secure messaging providers / clinics and pharmacy refills
* Does not use for changing appointments but uses secure messaging where the clinic calls him for appointment times
* likes secure messaging because he gets quick responses.
* recently discovered the lab results function… likes that he can print and take to his specialist
* pharmacy section should list active medications first with expired meds at the bottom
* in non-VA provider, patient expects to see how he can get care in the community.
### Concerns:
* What is finance?
* Why use term apply for disability benefits… shouldn’t it say adjust or increase disability… users who have healthcare… already have applied and received disability benefits?
### Suggestions:
* Add search box to header
* Add notifications (e.g. new health record information received, xyz prescription is nearing refill, xyz, RX is expired)
* In the appointment section, it should include specialty and M.D. so they know what the appointment is for.
* The Footer should have the members PCM clinic contact information and hours of operation
* When pulling open the VA appointment, you should be able to pull a map to get there, and if a large facility, a facility map on where the clinic is located.  Also, clinic hours.
