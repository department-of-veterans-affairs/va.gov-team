## P2 - Mobile Homepage concept

### Before showing concept

Uses MHV website, not mobile app/site
Uses VA.gov for health care
Knows there are 3 ways to login, they google VA health and click the top link 
Continue to “my __ “ name and pass saved in password manager 

Uses site to make appointments (that’s it) 
Only used MHV once a month ago, has not used appointments very much
Gave coverage for him after graduate school 
Has not used other similar sites to communicate with doctors

Would also use MHV to refill prescriptions (did not know if it was an option)

### First impressions of mobile page:

Cool that we have the marine corp emblem for what you served in
Seeing rate at the top is cool

Would be good to know what you got with the rating (every vet knows their rating) but not sure what to do with that information 

Eye immediately went to the marine corp logo

### Additional observations: 

Looks pretty straightforward


### What expect to see at top of page 
Would be cool to have default location (center selected for appointments) 

### What would you expect from Appointments 

Confused by question, said it might bring up a map 
Would like to see the hours the medical center is open
Would like to see address of medical center
Would like to see google maps to show directions to appointment location
Not sure if list view or calendar view is better for viewing all appointments (that was their expectation if they clicked on “view”) 

### What would you like to see for appointments 
Link for directions, phone number, hours of medical center 

### Pharmacy module, what info would you expect
 His prescription was mailed to him

### Pharmacy module, what would you like to see (what is most valuable)
Where you could pick up your prescription
Phone number to contact pharmacy

### If you wanted to view all your prescriptions what would you do? 
Click on pharmacy top header, unless there was a header that said prescription
Might be clearer if it said prescriptions instead of pharmacy

### Additional comments
Question if they could put directions for pharmacy for medications that you have, would be nice, how to get to pharmacy

### What would messages be about?

### Results from blood test or x ray
Information about the center (with covid, masks or no masks) , parking updates,  

### Would you expect to send or receive messages from home page? 

Would expect to just see messages coming in. would not expect to send messages from the home page

### Would you want to send messages? 
Thinks it would be important to be able to send messages 

### If there was functionality to send messages, whom to send to?
Would want to send message to doctor that they saw 

### How would you send a message? 
Would expect to send messages from clicking through 

### Medical Records, what would you expect? 
Lab results, blood work, any kind of x rays
Not sure if you upload your medical records there (your military health record) 

### What information or actions do you care about most in medical records? 
Maybe prescription history or active prescriptions could be moved to medical records, otherwise they think it is good  
Is anything missing from medical records? 
Maybe a prescription section but depends on where you would want to put it (a list of prescription history – would be nice to know what and when you had it) 


### Health care section

### How would you define health care
Would talk about benefits covered under your disability rating

### Within health care section, if you want to see more information than is shown what would you do?
Click on available benefits to see what all is covered based on your rating
Not sure what would happen I they clicked My VA Health care Plan 

### Disability section

What information or actions would you like to see? 
Pretty much covered, never filed an appeal or claim outside military. Never done it afterward. VFW helped them with the disability rating

Any other content or resources you would like to see? 
Not sure what information they would need. Would click on applying for disability and expect to go to the VA page. 

### Help and resources section

### Any resources you want to see about disability?
Not sure. Long process and having to gather paperwork and knowing where to go and what signatures you need is the tough part. Not sure how to put it into the website because its different for every base 

### If you had trouble with something on the website what would you do? 
Would probably call the help desk. Would not call VA help desk necessarily but would call center help desk. 

### In help and resources area, what info would you expect to find?
Maybe location finder for finding nearest VA location

### When I say health supplies, what does that term mean?
Thinking of masks, syringes, gloves

Believes health supplies is more what a hospital would use and does not make sense for prosthetic socks, hearing aids, etc. 

### If you had a magic wand, what would you add or change about the home page?

They initially didn’t have any comments for magic wands
Working on the quick actions 
An enrollment section, since he had trouble enrolling and had to show up with id card 
Way to enroll in a center (or how to enroll) in a center
Would put it at the very bottom in resources section 
You have to enroll at a new center at a new state unless someone passes your data around
