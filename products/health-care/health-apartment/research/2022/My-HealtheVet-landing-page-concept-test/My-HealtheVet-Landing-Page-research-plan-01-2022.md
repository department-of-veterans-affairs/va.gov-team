# Research Plan for MHV on VA.gov Usability Round 1


## Background
Briefly describe the background of your product. Consider:
- What problem is your product trying to solve?
- Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)
- What is Veterans’ familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?

### OCTO Objectives 

Which [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme) does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.

### Veteran Journey
Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)?
Are there moments that matter? 

## Research Goals	



### Outcome
How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?

### Research questions
Consider bucketing research questions under research goals. For each question, think about:
- What will I do with what I learn from this question?
- Does this question serve the goals of my study?
- Do not write out all questions you plan to ask participants -- that should go in the [conversation guide.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/conversation-guide-template.md) 

### Hypothesis
What do you intend to learn and measure from this study? Think through these prompts to develop a strong hypothesis.
- What do you already know about this problem space?
- What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the study, so don’t skip this step!)
- Write a generalized statement that combines what you know + what you think will happen during the study. 
- Remember to constrain the hypothesis to the goals of your study!

## Method	
We use conduct remote moderated usability studies using a high fidelity Sketch prototype. This round of research is focused on the laptop/desktop experience. Future rounds of research will explore mobile versions of the prototype.


### Location
This research will be remote via Zoom.

## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach
The audience is Veterans with and without VA healthcare, to be recruited by Perigean. 


Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Refer to the resources above to learn more. [Use the recruitment checker on Microsoft Excel teams](https://governmentcio.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/VSATeam/Shared%20Documents/Accessibility/RecruitmentChecker.xlsx?d=we0ffb06d5bac4cd5902c5f8b23fe988c&csf=1&web=1&e=FzYt5t) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity. *Note: if you are struggling to access the online teams link; you can also [use the recruitment checker on Google sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) and take a screenshot of your table to share.*

### Recruitment criteria
Please schedule a total of 15 Veterans for an expected completion rate of 10-12 studies. 

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
- At least six participants that have VA healthcare and regularly use MyHealtheVet
- Up to six participants that do not use VA healthcare or MyHealtheVet
- At least four women
- Must have access to a laptop or desktop computer to interact with the prototype. 

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**


## Timeline


### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.)

Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email: TBD
* Date and time of pilot session: TBD

### Research sessions
- We plan to run sessions from February 2 - March 5th, 2022

### Length of sessions
1 hour sessions with 30 minute breaks in between.
